    "however , observing cool ( @xmath1550k ) molecular hydrogen is difficult ; the molecule has no permanent electric dipole and so one must rely on tracer molecular emission ( the most common being ro - vibrational emission from the @xmath16co isotopomer [ hereafter ` co ' ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , uncertainty of the precise calibration of co luminosity to total gas mass in both low- and high-@xmath17 galaxies have made interpretation of results challenging ; even in the local universe there is seen to be metallicity and luminosity dependence on the conversion ( boissier et al.2003 ; blitz et al .  2007 ;",
    "komugi et al .",
    "2010 ) . furthermore , although the bulk of the molecular gas in star - forming disks is contained in virialised clouds , it is clear that the most luminous galaxies  mostly mergers  have molecular gas distributions and star - formation modes dramatically different to quiescent disks ; they require an alternative molecular mass calibration related to the physical conditions of their interstellar media ( solomon et al .",
    "the importance of understanding how the thermodynamic state of the gas affects the calibration also remains controversial ( high-@xmath17 observations typically target @xmath18 , requiring some correction to @xmath19 based on the excitation of the gas ; although see ivison et al .",

    "the majority of molecular gas studies at high-@xmath17 have , necessarily , focused on the most active systems ( generally sub - millimeter selected galaxies and quasars ) , and so comparatively little is known about the evolution of the molecular gas properties of the more common , but less active population .",
    "nevertheless , recent studies have started to make progress in expanding the parameter space of co observations at high-@xmath17 , and several studies have detected co emission from ` normal ' disks at @xmath20@xmath21 ( daddi et al .  2008 ; 2010 ;",

    "the striking result it that the efficiency of star - formation in these distant galaxies is claimed to be similar to that seen in local ` quiescent ' disks ( dannerbauer et al .",

    "is broadly characterised by @xmath127 , with @xmath1282.5 , shallower than the rate of decline of the average specific sfr in galaxies over the same epoch , which falls off more like @xmath129 ( e.g.  karim et al .",
    "this is expected , since molecular reservoirs can be replenished with fresh material via cooling ; thus , it is the relative evolution of the cooling rate and star formation rate that shape the evolution of @xmath13 .",

    "2 we show the average @xmath130 fraction in @xmath119 galaxies selected in halos of various mass from the galform model ( galaxies populated within the millennium simulation @xmath14cdm framework ) . this latest model ( lagos et al .",
    "2010 ) implements an empirically based star - formation law ( blitz & rosolowsky  2006 ) to estimate the molecular gas mass . the model predicts that at @xmath131 @xmath13 is lower and the rate of decline faster for more massive halos , and at in the mass regime pertinent to the samples presented , @xmath132 , evolves in a way similar to the observations .",
    "the results are broadly consistent with other models . for example , in smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations , kere et al .",
    "( 2005 ) predict that the average accretion rate of gas onto galaxies within halos of @xmath133 decreases from @xmath134 at @xmath135 to @xmath136 at @xmath5 .",
    "the observed evolution is also consistent with the predicted cosmological evolution of the accretion rate at fixed halo mass in other models ( see dutton et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath13 is expected to be strongly dependent on galaxy mass , since the evolution of the global average sfr appears to be halo mass dependent , as does the expected evolution of the gas accretion rate .",
    "cooling and star formation are the key drivers of the molecular gas fraction ; but it is also sensitive to the merger rate ( which can deliver molecular material , trigger star - formation and reconfigure the baryonic content ) , feedback ( heating or ejection of cold gas and h@xmath137 dissociation ) , environmental effects ( e.g.  ram - pressure stripping ) and growth in size of galaxy disks .",
    "the latter has an important effect since it ( on average ) reduces the disk hydrostatic pressure ( @xmath138 ) and therefore the efficiency of h@xmath137 formation ( reflected in the @xmath139/hi ratio , elmegreen  1993 ; wong & blitz  2002 ) , as can the metallicity and strength of the interstellar uv radiation field .",
    "selection effects will affect fig .  2 severely , and we should discuss how these might affect our interpretation .",
    "sensitivity limits do not allow us to detect galaxies with very low gas fractions at high-@xmath17 , and in low-@xmath17 surveys the very gas rich systems appear to be rare .",
    "here we have attempted to compare similar galaxies across a range of epochs , but the current sample sizes are small , and inhomogeneously selected ; any conclusions we draw from fig .  2 should be treated as indicative for future surveys that can more precisely control selection and have the efficiency to survey larger numbers .",
    "a further caveat to note is that both daddi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and tacconi et al.(2010 ) apply corrections to their observed co luminosities on account of the difference in the rayleigh - jeans brightness temperature of the higher _ j _ transitions targeted .",
