    "the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) , a ground - based cherenkov array telescope , has recently reported results of a first sensitive survey of the galactic plane with an average flux sensitivity of a few percent of the crab at energies above 100 gev , revealing the existence of a new population of tev sources ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005a , 2006a ) .",
    "the detection of a significant number of such sources has important astrophysical implications for our understanding of cosmic particle acceleration .",
    "different types of galactic sources are known to be cosmic particle accelerators and potential sources of high energy @xmath0-rays : isolated pulsars / pulsar wind nebulae ( pwns ) , supernova remnants ( snrs ) , star forming regions , binary systems with a collapsed object like a microquasar or a pulsar etc .",
    "several of these new tev emitters have no obvious counterpart at other energies thus making the search for x and soft @xmath0-ray emission of key importance to disentangle the mechanisms involved in the different emitting regions and , in turn , to understand the nature of these objects .",
    "hess j1616508 , with a flux of @xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 above 200 gev , is one of the brightest of these new hess sources ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005a ; aharonian et al .",
    "2006a ) . its tev spectrum is well modelled with a power law having a photon index @xmath5 .",
    "the source is spatially extended , with a rather circular shape , an angular diameter of @xmath616@xmath7 and it does not seem to have any counterpart at other wavelengths .",
    "previous observations of this region performed in x - rays by _",
    "chandra _ ( vink 2004 ) did not detect any extended x - ray source associated with the tev emission .",
    "hess j1616508 is located in a complex region containing two known snrs , rcw 103 ( g332.40.4 ) and kes 32 ( g332.4 + 0.1 ) , which are not spatially coincident with the hess extension , being located 13@xmath7 and 17@xmath7 away , respectively .",
    "the first is a young shell type snr , quite bright in x - rays ( 0.510 kev flux @xmath6@xmath8 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) and with an absorbed soft spectrum ( becker & aschenbach 2002 ) ; it is characterized as having an x - ray point source , 1e 1613485055.1 , at its centre . since its discovery",
    ", this point source has been shown to be a peculiar object : recent _ xmm - newton _ data indicates the presence of a long period and extreme variability indicating that it may be either an x - ray binary in an eccentric orbit or a peculiar type of magnetar ( de luca et al .",
    "the second snr , kes 32 , is only detected at harder x - ray energies ( with a 1.55 kev flux of @xmath9 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) because of a large interstellar absorption ( @xmath6@xmath10 @xmath3 ) and is characterized by a thermal spectrum of @xmath11 @xmath61 kev ( vink 2004 ) .    in the vicinity",
    "( 9@xmath7 away ) of hess j1616508 a young x - ray emitting pulsar psr j16175055 is also present ; it was serendipitously discovered during _ asca _ observation of rcw 103 ( torii et al . 1998 ) and it is , assuming a magnetospheric outer gap model , predicted to emit in the tev regime ( hirotani 2001 ) .",
    "two other pulsars ( psr j16165109 and psr j16145048 ) are further away and less likely to produce high energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "recently , hess j1616508 has been observed with the _ suzaku _ x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) .",
    "no positive detection of x - ray emission has been found down to a 210 kev limiting flux of @xmath12 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( matsumoto et al .",
    "similarly , _",
    "xmm - newton _ data , analysed by the same authors , set an upper limit to the x - ray flux three times higher than the _ suzaku _ one .",
    "it follows that the source , bright in the tev @xmath0-rays , is faint in the x - ray band , raising the possibility that we are dealing with a `` dark particle accelerator '' .    in this work we present the analysis of observations of hess j1616508 performed with the _ integral _ ( winkler et al . 2003 ) and",
    "_ swift _ ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) satellites .",
    "in addition , we also use _ _ beppo__sax and _ xmm - newton _ archival data that cover the tev extension / region .",
    "all these data are combined and discussed in order to assess the most likely counterpart to the hess source and to understand its nature .",
    "the region surrounding hess j1616508 has been covered by the third _ integral _ ibis / isgri survey ( bird et al .",
    "2007 ) , which consists of several pointings from the beginning of the mission ( november 2002 ) up to april 2006 .",
    "the total exposure on this region is of @xmath62 ms .",
    "isgri images for each available pointing were generated in various energy bands using the isdc offline scientific analysis software osa ( goldwurm et al .",
    "2003 ) version 5.1 .",
    "the individual images were then combined to produce a mosaic of the entire sky to enhance the detection significance using the system described in details by bird et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : integral ] shows the 1860 kev energy band image of the region surrounding hess j1616508 : a clear excess is detected with a significance of @xmath67.4@xmath13 at a position corresponding to r.a.=16@xmath1417@xmath15 12@xmath16.72 and dec=50@xmath17 56@xmath7 31@xmath18.20 ( j2000.0 ) with a positional uncertainty of 3@xmath19 .",
    "although the ibis / isgri excess is compatible with the hess source , within the isgri error box ( smaller yellow circle in the figure ) there is only the pulsar psr j16175055 .",
    "fluxes for spectral analysis were extracted from narrow - band mosaics of all pointings in the third _ integral _ ibis / isgri survey which are relevant to the sky region containing hess j1616508 . here and in the following , spectral analysis have been performed using xspec v. 12.2.1 ; quoted errors correspond to 90@xmath1 confidence level for one interesting parameter ( @xmath20 ) .",

    "as there is no _ integral _ detection of the tev object , we can derive from the ibis / isgri mosaics a 2@xmath13 upper limit to the flux of any undetected counterpart : @xmath25 and @xmath26 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 in the 2040 and 40100 kev energy band , respectively . to conclude , _",

    "hess j1616508 was observed with xrt ( x - ray telescope , 0.210 kev ) on board the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) on several occasions during the period june 2006  march 2007 ; the exposures span from @xmath64 to @xmath66 ks .",
    "data reduction was performed using the xrtdas v. 2.0.1 standard data pipeline package ( xrtpipeline v. 0.10.6 ) , in order to produce screened event files .",
    "all data were extracted only in the photon counting ( pc ) mode ( hill et al .",
    "2004 ) , adopting the standard grade filtering ( 012 for pc ) according to the xrt nomenclature .",
    "all available xrt images of hess j1616508 in the 0.310 kev band were analysed with the ximage package ( v. 4.3 ) . within the hess extension , we find only one source , which is detected in all observations , at a confidence level of 34@xmath13 , and is located at r.a.=16@xmath1415@xmath15 50@xmath16.94 and dec=50@xmath17 49@xmath7 26@xmath18.39 ( j2000.0 ) , with a 90% uncertainty of 5@xmath18 ; it was not seen by _ suzaku _ because it was outside its field of view .",
    "this object ( with a 210 kev flux of @xmath27 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 estimated assuming a crab - like spectrum ) has a soft spectrum , being detected at the lowest xrt energies and also being reported as a rosat / hri source ; it has a usno - b1.0 ( monet et al .",

    "this finding suggests that other possible counterparts may also be searched outside the tev extension .",
    "_ _ beppo__sax pointed at 1e 1613485055.1 on 17 september 1998 , 23 march and 4 august 1999 , for @xmath616.5 , @xmath638 and @xmath653 ks , respectively , and these observations covered , at least in part , the hess j1616508 region .",
    "the mecs event files were downloaded from the asi scientific data centre and analysed with ximage v4.3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mecs1 ] and figure  [ fig : mecs2 ] show the images of the region surrounding rcw 103/1e 1613485055.1 in the 24 and 410 kev energy bands ; the _ swift _ source was not detected by the mecs instrument probably because it was below its detection threshold .    by comparing the mecs images , we found that , while 1e 1613405055.1 and the associated snr rcw 103 dominate at soft energies , psr j16175055 emerges at high energies ; this evidence confirms the _ integral _ result , and points to the pulsar as the only source emitting above a few kev .",
    "however , this also implies that it is difficult to examine the energy spectrum of psr j16175055 in the soft energy band where the diffuse emission from rcw 103 contributes significantly .",
    "therefore , in all three _ _",
    "beppo__sax observations of psr j16175055 , events for spectral analysis were selected in circular regions of 3@xmath7 in the 3.510 kev energy band .",
    "background spectra were extracted in a region far from the snr rcw 103 , so that the contamination from its diffuse emission is negligible .",
    "for this off - axis source , we used the appropriate mecs ancillary response files to correct for the effects of vignetting .",
    "we find that an absorbed power law , in which the intrinsic column density is left free to vary , provides a good description of the mecs data for all three observations .",
    "for each individual measurement , spectral parameters are compatible within their uncertainties and no flux variation is observed between measurements . in view of these indications , we summed together the three datasets and estimated the average spectral properties .",
    "the absorbed power law remains the best - fit model for the pulsar emission ( @xmath32 ) , giving @xmath33 @xmath3 , @xmath34 and an average 3.510 kev observed flux of @xmath6@xmath35 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "our spectral parameters are compatible , within their respective uncertainties , with the _ asca _ results ( torii et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "the extrapolation of the 3.510 kev spectrum of psr j16175055 at high energies is also in agreement , within uncertainties , with the _ integral _ flux .",
    "overall , the _",
    "_ beppo__sax data indicate that above a few kev ( i.e. in the non - thermal regime ) only one source is bright and stable , psr j16175055 .",
    "its spectrum is hard and absorbed as expected from a pulsar located in the galactic plane ; as the galactic column density in the direction of the source is @xmath36 @xmath3 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , we conclude that the measured @xmath37 is not intrinsic , but likely due to galactic interstellar absorption .",
    "to complete the picture of the region of interest here , we have also reanalysed _ xmm - newton _ data , which have already been discussed in various papers ( matsumoto et al .",
    "2007 ; de luca et al . 2006",
    "; becker & aschenback 2002 ) and which were collected during a 28 ks observation made on 2001 september 3 ( obs i d : 0113050701 ) .",
    "first , we searched for x - ray point sources in the mos images . apart from rcw 103 , psr j16175055 and",
    "1e 1613485055.1 , we found a number of other objects , none of which fall inside the hess extension ( see figure  [ fig : xmm ] ) ; this is not in contradiction with the _ swift_/xrt result as the only source seen by this instrument is outside the _ xmm - newton _ field of view . the closest new x - ray source to hess",
    "j1616508 is located at r.a.=16@xmath1417@xmath15 23@xmath38.87 and dec=50@xmath17 51@xmath7 52@xmath18.48 ( j2000.0 ) with a positional uncertainty of 1@xmath18 and is associated to a star ( hd 146184 ) .",
    "when we looked at the mos images , obtained in the 410 kev energy band , only two sources are clearly detected , psr j16175055 and 1e 1613485055.1 .",
    "contrary to what was found for _",
    "_ beppo__sax , the _ xmm - newton _",
    "flux for 1e 1613485055.1 is now comparable with that of the pulsar , clearly indicating that 1e 1613485055.1 is highly variable . indeed , de luca et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found variability both in flux and spectral shape : in particular the spectrum is steep ( @xmath39 ) when the source is bright and it is hard when dim .",
    "all these characteristics ( compactness , variability and spectral shape ) suggest that 1e 1613485055.1 is unlikely to be associated with hess j1616508 , which is not variable and is extended , leaving as an alternative possible counterpart only the pulsar .",
    "we have therefore reanalysed the mos spectral data of this object with the aim of combining them with _ _ beppo__sax and _ integral _ observations .",
    "source spectra have been extracted from a circular region of @xmath40 radius , while background spectra were taken from source - free circular regions of @xmath41 radius around the source and in the same ccd .",
    "spectral fits were performed simultaneously with mos1 and mos2 in the 0.510 kev energy band . the cross - calibration constant mos2/mos1 was left free to vary and found to lie in the range 1.061.16 .",
    "we find that the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum is well described by an absorbed power law having parameters compatible with those reported by becker & aschenbach ( 2002 ) .",
    "when these data are combined with the _ _",
    "beppo__sax / mecs and _ integral _ data , we obtained a similar spectral shape with the following parameters : @xmath42 , a column density @xmath43 @xmath3 , an unabsorbed 210 kev flux of @xmath44 erg s@xmath4 @xmath3 , and cross calibration constants mecs / mos and ibis / mos in the range 0.911.03 and 0.651.22 , respectively .",
    "these combined data are shown in figure  [ fig : broadspec ] : the good match between the various datasets and also the hard shape of the pulsar spectrum are evident from the figure .",
    "it is worth noting that this broad band spectrum is the result of two components , pulsed and unpulsed , with the latter emission being possibly associated to an as yet unseen pwn .",
    "indeed , becker & aschenbach ( 2002 ) found that the pulsed fraction contributes to @xmath650@xmath1 in the 2.515 kev band , with some indication ( albeit not statistically significant ) of an increase of the pulsed fraction with energy .",
    "to look for this pwn , we have also searched the mos 0.54 kev image for the presence of diffuse emission around the pulsar , taking into account an annular region having internal and external radius of 40@xmath18 and 120@xmath18 and a total area of 11.2 arcmin@xmath45 ; a similar region was used to estimate the background .",
    "we found a count rate of @xmath46 and @xmath47 counts arcmin@xmath48 for the source and the background , respectively .",
    "this implies that the contribution of the diffuse emission is @xmath49 counts arcmin@xmath48 , which corresponds to a 19@xmath13 detection . in the 410 kev energy band",
    "the count rates become @xmath50 and @xmath51 counts arcmin@xmath48 again for the source and the background , respectively ; thus the contribution of this diffuse component becomes less evident above 4 kev ( @xmath52 counts arcmin@xmath48 ) but still detectable , albeit at only 3@xmath13 level .",
    "we have also checked for the presence of any asymmetry in this diffuse emission ( i.e. looking in the direction towards and away from the hess source ) , but we were unable to find any significant evidence for it .",
    "it is difficult , with the present data , to assess if this diffuse component is due to the presence of a pwn around psr j16175055 or to emission related to rcw 103 , especially in view of the _ suzaku _ detection of soft thermal emission near the location of hess j1616508 ( matsumoto et al .",
    "2007 ) . taking the _ xmm - newton _ data at face value and fitting this diffuse emission with an absorbed power law ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath3 )",
    ", we estimate a 210 kev observed flux of @xmath55 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , which can be used as an upper limit to the presence of a pwn around psr j16175055 .",
    "the value we measure is much higher than the thermal emission flux seen by _ suzaku _ and it is also above the upper limit to the hard x - ray emission from hess j1616508 set by _ xmm - newton_. this , coupled with the possible detection of hard emission above 4 kev , suggests the possibility that we are indeed observing the pwn associated with psr j16175055 ; it follows that its dimension needs to be similar to that of the anular region used to estimate the diffuse component ( @xmath6 120@xmath18 ) .",
    "note , however , that radio data show no evidence , in the pulsar direction , for extended emission on spatial scale @xmath56 6@xmath18 down to a 3@xmath13 limiting flux of 1.2 mjy ( kaspi et al .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the pwn is closer to the pulsar and its emission is mixed with that of psr j16175055 ; in this case the pwn 210 kev flux is @xmath57 2@xmath58 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( i.e. 50@xmath1 of the total flux measured by _ xmm - newton_/mos and _ _ beppo__sax / mecs ) and its dimension @xmath57 30@xmath18 ( considering the extraction radius used for the _ xmm - newton_/mos ) .",
    "we consider the above flux as an upper limit because diffuse emission , unrelated to the pwn , could also contribute here .",
    "a detailed x - ray analysis of the region surrounding hess j1616508 provides one clear result : there is no totally convincing x - ray counterpart found within the tev extension .",
    "searches in various radio archives  ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/archive.html ) give a similar result , thus suggesting that either a  dark particle accelerator \" ( an object with no x - ray / radio counterpart ) is producing very high energy @xmath0-rays or that any plausible counterpart is very weak ( if positionally coincident with the hess object ) or located outside the tev extension .",
    "indeed , the first possibility was presented and discussed by the _",
    "suzaku _ team ( matsumoto et al . 2007 ) on the basis of their results . here",
    ", we would like to suggest the alternative scenario derived from our data set .    _",
    "swift_/xrt finds only one x - ray source , but the low statistical quality of the data and its characteristics make it an unlikely candidate for the source that powers the hess nebula .",
    "therefore , the only other possibility is to explore energetic objects located in the region surrounding the hess source .",
    "this region is a zone of complex stellar activity due to its location tangential to our line of sight to the norma spiral arm .",
    "there are two nearby snrs ( rcw 103 and kes 32 ) and three pulsars ( psr j16175055 , psr j16165109 and psr j16145048 ) ( vink 2004 ; torii et al .",
    "1998 ) . of the two snr , only rcw 103 is of some interest mainly due to the presence of the compact source 1e 1613485055.1 at its centre : however , this object is too variable in x - rays to be possibly associated with the stable hess source .",
    "the relevant characteristics of the three pulsars in the region are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "here the final column shows the tev luminosity as a percentage of the pulsar spin down energy loss if situated at the distance of each pulsar .",
    "whereas in principle , the total energy available for the tev emission could possibly extend up to a maximum of @xmath59 integrated over the lifetimes of the electrons against compton losses ( @xmath65 kyr ) , observations of pulsar - driven hess sources ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006a ) have shown that the tev emission is typically a few percent of the instantaneous energy loss of the pulsar .",
    "this fact , coupled with the _ integral _ detection of only psr j16175055 in the region , makes this young 69 ms pulsar the only realistic source of energetic @xmath0-rays .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      psr j16175055 has been well studied both at x - ray and radio frequencies ( torii et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; kaspi et al . 1998 ) and its parameters estimated with some accuracy . from the measured @xmath60 , a surface magnetic field of @xmath61 gauss and a spin - down luminosity @xmath62 erg s@xmath4 have been evaluated ; the implied characteristic age for psr j16175055 is 8.1 kyr , which makes psr j16175055 one of the youngest of all known pulsars ( kaspi et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the radio dispersion estimate provides a distance in the range 6.16.9 kpc , compatible with the column density measured in the source direction .",
    "the most likely companion snr to psr j16175055 is rcw 103 , however a clear mismatch both in terms of distances and ages argues against an association between the two ( see for example kaspi et al .",
    "1998 ) ; furthermore , the required pulsar velocity in case of an association would have to be very high , in clear disagreement with the lack of a visible forward bow shock nebula ( gaensler et al . 2004 ) or of a perturbation in the structure of the snr .",
    "clearly , an open question remains on where the snr left behind by the birth of this young pulsar is . as there is no obvious snr association ,",
    "the only possible site where the tev photons may be generated is the pulsar itself or an associated pwn / jet . in the first case ,",
    "a model like the one proposed by hirotani ( 2001 ) could be at work in the source , but it is then difficult to explain the offset observed between the x/@xmath0-ray emission and the tev one .",
    "alternatively , the energetic source of high energy electrons could be a jet from the pulsar or an as - yet unseen pwn .    using _ xmm - newton _ observational data we have performed a careful analysis of the x - ray image to search for any spatial extension / asymmetry of the emission around the pulsar .",
    "some evidence for extended x - ray emission was found over the 0.510 kev range although this could not be firmly associated to a pwn due to the presence of the nearby snr rcw 103 . despite this uncertainty",
    ", some information could be gained from the data : in fact , the x/@xmath0-ray and tev emission are different in size ( by a factor of less than 416 , depending on which of the two pwn scenarios described in section 5 we adopt ) and offset from each other by @xmath610@xmath7 ; if the pwn is the production site of the tev photons , then we also have a difference in flux greater than a factor of 2030 . a natural way to explain the different sizes of the emitting regions for the tev photons as compared to the x / soft @xmath0-ray ones is related to the different cooling time - scales and hence propagation distances : electrons producing photons of different energies spend different periods to emit them over different emitting volumes .",
    "the lifetimes of the electrons that generate the tev photons against compton cooling in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is @xmath65000 years and they are able to propagate further into the interstellar medium ; even if there is a significant magnetic field present in the region making their lifetime shorter , it is still @xmath63 kyr for a 10 @xmath63gauss field .",
    "the lifetimes of the more energetic electrons that produce the x/@xmath0-ray fluxes by the synchrotron process in the same magnetic field is of the order of a few hundred years .",
    "if we simplistically assume that the relative size of the x and @xmath0-ray objects are proportional to the lifetimes of the parent electrons then we would expect , for a 16@xmath7 tev source , to see a much smaller sized object ( @xmath61@xmath7 ) in the x/@xmath0-ray domain . for continuous injection and radiative losses that are short compared to the age of the source ,",
    "the spectral index of the electrons steepens with a corresponding steepening of the photon emission .",
    "the observed spectral index of the combined x / soft @xmath0-ray emission ( @xmath64 ) , and that of the tev emission ( @xmath65 ) are consistent with this scenario .",
    "the x / soft @xmath0-ray fluxes represent the uncooled component and the tev photons are derived from inverse compton scatters of the synchrotron cooled electrons on the cmb : we may also expect the cooled electrons , which produce the tev photons , to create an extended euv / soft x - ray fluxes through the synchrotron process .",
    "however , in view of the large column density observed in the source direction , it is unlikely that we would be able to detect such a weak diffuse uv source .",
    "in fact , we have inspected the available _",
    "swift_/uvot images , but we failed to detect this emission , due to the combination of the strong absorption along the line of sight , and contamination by a significant number of bright point sources along the same line of sight . while overall the scenario we described is compatible with the observational evidence , it is not clear why the electrons should stream out on one side only to generate their high energy inverse compton @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "however , despite a lack of understanding of this phenomenon , an increasing number of tev sources are found to be shifted away from the pulsars that generated them .",
    "perhaps the most prominent example of this new class of tev objects is hess j1825137 ( aharonian et al .",
    "this source has many similar characteristics to hess j1616508 : an associated pulsar of comparative period ( 101 ms ) and age ( @xmath66 yr ) that is coincident with an x - ray and possibly with a soft @xmath0-ray source ( malizia 2006 , private communication ) ; the tev luminosity is a similar fraction ( 12% ) of the pulsar spin down power ; the tev emissions have similar photon indices of @xmath62.4 ; both tev nebulae are similar in size ( within a factor of 2 ) and offset from the position of the pulsar by the same amount ; in both objects the tev emitting region is larger that the x - ray one ; finally , no snr has been detected in either case . however , whereas hess j1825137 does have an offset pwn ( g18.00.7 , gaensler et al . 2003 ) located to the south , the presence of a visible pwn in hess j1616508 is highly uncertain .",
    "taking advantage of this similarity , we have estimated the x - ray flux of the eventual pwn around psr j16175055 , using the information available for pwn g18.00.7 , i.e. the same spectrum ( see gaensler et al .",
    "2003 ) , but scaled by an appropriate factor to take into account the differences in distance and column density .",
    "we estimated a 210 kev observed flux of @xmath62 @xmath67 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , far below the flux value estimated for the two pwn scenarios .",
    "if the pwn is more extended , this flux mismatch points to the possibility that at least part of the diffuse emission we measured is due to a pwn ; in the alternative case of a pwn which is more compact and mixed with the pulsar emission , the flux difference implies than only a fraction of the unpulsed component is due to the plerion emission .",
    "this leaves both scenarios as viable , although still rather undefined .",
    "clearly , the location of psr j16175055 near rcw 103 , the high column density in the source direction , as well as the geometry / intensity of any pwn present in the source , make the detection of such a component very difficult to achieve . clearly ,",
    "a long dedicated x - ray observation to disintangle these various components is required to settle this issue .",
    "concerning the offset morphology , asymmetric reverse shock interactions have been proposed for the case of the vela system ( hess j0835455 ) on the basis of hydro - dynamical simulations ( blondin et al .",
    "2001 ) and subsequently observed in _",
    "chandra _ images ( helfand et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the x - ray images of the diffuse emission associated with hess j1825137 ( gaensler et al .",
    "2003 ) are also asymmetric with respect to the position of the pulsar but there is no evidence of a one - sided reverse shock process taking place .",
    "although in psr j16175055 there is no evidence of the existence of a pwn , let alone of any one - sided reverse shock , this does not necessarily dissociate it from hess j1616508 . while much more understanding of the processes at work in tev sources is needed to explain all the different morphologies observed , we can not ignore the fact that hess j1616508 is close to a pulsar energetic enough to explain the tev flux by its spin down power .",
    "two conclusions may be drawn directly from the observations presented in this work .",
    "first , that the power source that fuels the x/@xmath0-ray emission detected by _ integral _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ _ beppo__sax is almost certainly derived from the pulsar psr j16175055 .",
    "apart from the positional justification , this concept is fully consistent with the timing evidence coming from the _ xmm - newton _ data ( becker & aschenbach 2002 ) and the expected energetics of the system ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . the observed 210 and 20100 kev fluxes of @xmath68 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 and @xmath69 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 translate , at the distance of the pulsar , to luminosities which are approximately @xmath6@xmath70 erg s@xmath4 and @xmath6@xmath71 erg s@xmath4 , or 0.1% and 0.4@xmath1 of the spin down losses .",
    "these values are fully within the range observed from young radio pulsars like the crab and from pwn systems observed by _ integral _ ( dean et al . in preparation ) .",
    "likewise , for the pulsar to be responsible for the flux at tev energies , 1.2@xmath1 of the spin down energy loss is needed , in agreement with that observed in other hess sources .",
    "the fact that _ integral _ finds a point - like source at the position of psr j16175055 , that its spectrum smoothly connects to _ _ beppo__sax and _ xmm - newton _ spectra , and that the luminosity has a value consistent with what expected from a young radio pulsar , naturally make this pulsar the source that powers the high energy emission .",
    "second , that the tev emission is not positionally coincident with the pulsar and no other promising candidate counterpart has been found within the tev extension contour .",
    "however , the lack of precise positional coincidence between hess j1616508 and psr j16175055 does not necessarily dissociate the two objects , particularly in view of recent observational evidence of tev sources offset from their powering pulsars .",
    "we have argued that there is good evidence to assume that we have a pulsar driven system in which inverse compton and synchrotron processes combine to create the observed morphology of a broad - band emitter from kev to tev energies . under the assumption that the hess photons are a result of electrons derived from the pulsar that subsequently suffer compton scattering with the low energy photons of the cmb and that the x- and soft @xmath0-rays are created through synchrotron losses by the same ( although more energetic ) electron family members in the chaotic magnetic field of typically 10 @xmath63gauss near to the pulsar , then the relative sizes of the vhe and x/@xmath0 sources are consistent with the expected lifetimes of the parent electrons against synchrotron and compton interactions .",
    "the lack of an observable pwn is intriguing , but not damning , and a rationale for the one - sided nature of the hess object not understood , but not unprecedented ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006b ; mangano et al .",
    "2005 ) .    a long dedicated observation with _ chandra",
    "_ would be highly desirable to settle this issue .",
    "this research has been supported by asi under contracts i / r/046/04 and i/008/07/0 .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from simbad ( cds , strasbourg , france ) and heasarc ( nasa s goddard space flight centre ) .",
