    "while a large number of experiments have been performed in an attempt to provide an insight into the biological effects of the electromagnetic fields ( barnes and greenebaum 2006 , miller _ et al _ 2002 , polk and postow 1995 ) , the bioeffects of non - ionizing ultra - wideband ( uwb ) electromagnetic ( em ) pulses have not been studied in as much detail as the effects of continuous - wave ( cw ) radiation . nevertheless , as the interest for the application of uwb electromagnetic pulses increases , particularly in the communications industry and medicine , so does the interest to understand their bioeffects ( zastrow _ et al _ 2007 , ji _ et al _ 2006 , hu _",
    "et al _ 2005 , schoenbach _ et al _ 2004 ) .",
    "only recently was the work in the uwb field in the united states declassified ( taylor 1995 ) , and only in 2002 were uwb pulses approved by the federal communications commission in the u.s . for  applications such as radar imaging of objects buried under the ground or behind walls and short - range , high - speed data transmissions \" ( fcc 2002 ) .",
    "a computational approach to the exposure of biological tissues to non - ionizing uwb radiation is more involved than the computation of exposure to cw radiation .",
    "in addition to a realistic description of the geometry , the physical properties of exposed biological material have to be known over a broad frequency range . the computation has to be numerically robust and appropriate for the computer technology of today . the finite difference - time domain ( fdtd )",
    "method , introduced by kane yee in the 1960s ( yee 1966 ) and extensively developed in the 1990s ( sadiku 1992 , kunz and luebbers 1993 , sullivan 2000 , taflove and hagness 2000 ) , is a well known numerical method that satisfies these conditions .",
    "the response of a biological system to an em pulse relates to the extent of conversion of em pulse energy into mechanical or thermal energy as the pulse propagates through the material . calculating the electric and magnetic fields around and inside the exposed material and combining these with the electromagnetic properties of the exposed material ,",
    "the specific absorption rate , total deposited energy , and induced current inside the sample can be calculated .",
    "finally , the interaction mechanism between the electromagnetic radiation and biological material can be modeled and understood .",
    "it is possible that the bioeffects of short em pulses are qualitatively different from those of narrow - band radio frequencies .",
    "if , for example , the specific absorption rate standards defined for continuous radio frequency by the american national standard institute ( ansi 1992 ) or by the international commission on non - ionizing radiation protection ( icnirp 1998 ) are applied to the short uwb pulses , their meaning loses its clarity . because of the pulses short duration and as a result of the non - uniform power absorption , the deposition power and the induced current densities are large and can exceed locally even the highest allowed power limit of 4 w / kg ( simicevic 2007 ) . at the same time",
    ", the energy from the exposure to an uwb pulse is too small to induce an increase in the temperature of the exposed sample due to , compared to cw , the much lower energy density of the uwb pulse .",
    "we have already applied the fdtd method to calculate the em fields inside biological samples exposed to nanopulses in a gtem cell ( simicevic and haynie 2005 , simicevic 2005 ) .",
    "we included in the calculation the geometry and the physical properties of the samples to the fullest extent and applied a full three - dimensional computation , but have restricted the calculation to one sample ( blood ) and the frequency range up to @xmath1 .    in this paper , the effects of the exposure of a human eye to uwb radiation in the frequency range of up to @xmath2",
    "are calculated using the same three - dimensional fdtd computer code described and validated in the previous works ( simicevic and haynie 2005 , simicevic 2005 ) .",
    "the shape and the physical properties of the eye are described as accurately as allowed by the existing data .",
    "the computational space of @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 @xmath5 was divided into @xmath6 cells and the computation was performed at the louisiana optical initiative ( loni ) cluster of supercomputers . the eye was exposed to the uwb pulses from three different frequency regions : @xmath7 ( authorized for communications and radar imaging ) , @xmath8 ( authorized for vehicle radars ) , and @xmath9 ( authorized for unlicensed use ) ( fcc 2002 ) .",
    "what follows is a detailed description of the computation : geometrical and physical properties of the eye , the properties of the uwb pulses , the details of the computation and data representation , and the results .",
    "the shape and the size of a human eye , an example of which is shown in figure  [ eye1 ] , varies from one individual to another and changes with age .",
    "while the theoretical eye models put the emphasis mostly on the optical properties of the eye ( norrby _ et al _ 2007 , de almeidai and carvalho 2007 , siedlecki _ et al _ 2004 , lotmar 1971 ) , they can as well be used in radiation protection ( charles and brown 1975 ) .",
    "schematics of the human eye . ]    for the application in the fdtd computing , the shape of the human eye was discretized by means of yee cells , cubes of an edge length @xmath10 ( yee 1966 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional shape of the eye shown in figure  [ eye1 ] was normalized to the dimensions of the existing theoretical eye models , the pixels belonging to different eye tissues were retrieved by image processing software , and , because of rotational symmetry , rotation around the proper axis of rotation was performed to create the three dimensional model of the eye . to account for as small structures of the eye as , for example , the thickness of the cornea ( only @xmath11 in size ) , and still be able to perform the computation in a reasonable time , the lengths of the yee cell were chosen to be @xmath12 the computation was performed inside the computational space of @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 @xmath5 in size discretized by @xmath6 cells .",
    "the front part of the eye constructed from yee cells is shown in figure  [ eye_front ] . to make figure  [ eye_front ] readable , 16 yee cells used in the computation are presented as one cell in the figure .",
    "front of the human eye discretized by means of yee cells .",
    "one cell in the figure represents 16 yee cells used in the computation . ]    during the process of discretization of the human eye , the structures of the eye were separated into the tissues of known dielectric properties : sclera , vitreous humour , lens cortex , cornea , lens nucleus , muscles , and blood .",
    "the eye was embedded in the bone , muscle and skin tissue ( wet and dry ) .",
    "when dealing with uwb radiation it was crucial to have a proper description of the dielectric properties of the exposed tissues over the entire frequency range .",
    "they were taken from the established references ( gabriel 1996 , gabriel c _ et al _ 1996 , gabriel s _",
    "et al _ 1996 ) .    from the relation between the size of a yee cell @xmath10 and the maximum frequency @xmath13 allowed in the fdtd computation ( kunz and luebbers 1993 , taflove and hagness 2000 )    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the speed of light in the material ,",
    "the yee cube edge length of @xmath16 may be used to model exposure to the wave frequency of up to @xmath17 .",
    "this value is far greater than the frequency range of the uwb pulses used in the calculation .",
    "we have achieved an optimal agreement between geometrical description of the eye and the computational requirements of the fdtd method .",
    "the eye was exposed to vertically polarized em pulses , each covering one of three different frequency regions : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the shape of the pulse is obtained by the inverse fourier transformation of the uniform spectral density of frequency width @xmath18 around the central frequency @xmath19 of the frequency region . in the time domain ,",
    "this transform is described by the function    @xmath20 \\over   { \\pi \\delta f ( t - t_{0 } ) } } \\cos[2 \\pi f_{c } ( t - t_{0 } ) ] e^ { - { ( t - t_{0})^{2 }   \\over   { 2 \\sigma^{2 } } } } ,   \\label{pulse}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the pulse amplitude , @xmath22 is the time shift of the pulse , and @xmath23 is the pulse width .",
    "the exponential term @xmath24 allows for a smooth rise and fall of the pulse having , at the same time , a small effect on the pulse spectral density .",
    "the numerical value of the parameter @xmath22 was the same for all the frequency regions , @xmath25 .",
    "for the frequency region of @xmath7 : @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for the frequency region of @xmath8 : @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; and for the frequency region of @xmath9 : @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "the shapes and the frequency spectra of the pulses are plotted in figure  [ spectra ] .    .",
    "the amplitudes are normalized to @xmath33 . from the left",
    "are the shape and the spectrum for the pulse in the frequency region of @xmath7 , pulse in the region of @xmath8 , and pulse in the region of @xmath34.,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "the amplitudes are normalized to @xmath33 . from the left",

    "are the shape and the spectrum for the pulse in the frequency region of @xmath7 , pulse in the region of @xmath8 , and pulse in the region of @xmath34.,title=\"fig : \" ]    understanding the propagation of a uwb pulse is more demanding than understanding the propagation of a continuous em wave .",
    "for some pulse frequencies the exposed sample looks like a conductor while for others it looks like a dielectric .",
    "the amount of the conduction currents compared to the displacement currents changes over the frequency spectrum of the em pulse . in this paper",
    "we have restricted ourselves to studying the propagation of the pulses with almost uniform power spectra in the frequency range imposed by the fcc rules .",
    "electromagnetic properties of a tissue are normally expressed in terms of frequency - dependent dielectric properties and conductivity .",
    "when dealing with an uwb electromagnetic pulse , it is crucial that these properties are properly described over a large frequency range .",
    "one of the most accepted models describing the dielectric properties of a tissue is the cole - cole model .",
    "the references ( gabriel 1996 , gabriel c _ et al _ 1996 , gabriel s _",
    "et al _ 1996 ) ) provide the four - term cole - cole parametrization of the dielectric properties of the ocular tissue used in the present work    @xmath35    in this equation @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the permittivity in the terahertz frequency range , @xmath38 are the changes in permittivity in a specified frequency range , @xmath39 are the relaxation times , @xmath40 is the ionic conductivity , and @xmath41 are the coefficients specific for the cole - cole model .",
    "they constitute up to 14 real parameters of a fitting procedure .",
    "application of the cole - cole model is problematic for fdtd .",
    "it requires time consuming numerical integration techniques and makes computation unacceptably slow .",
    "if , instead of a cole - cole parametrization , the debye model    @xmath42    is used , the computation time can be reduced by an order of magnitude using very efficient piecewise - linear recursive convolution ( plrc ) method ( luebbers _ et al _ 1990 , 1991 , luebbers and hunsberger 1992 , kunz and luebbers 1993 , taflove and hagness 2000 ) .",
    "but , it is also important that the debye model provides an equally accurate description of the physical properties of a biological tissue .    in his thesis ,",
    "g. r. lugo ( lugo 2006 ) used an accurate , robust and efficient vector fitting technique ( vectfit ) ( gustavsen and semlyen 1999 ) to replace the cole - cole parametrization by a multi - term debye parametrization with no loss in the precision .",
    "his procedure is used in this paper . while the accuracy of the debye parameterization increases with the number of terms ,",
    "so does the computational time and the requirement on the memory , and an optimal number of terms has to be selected .",
    "it was found that in the frequency region considered in this paper the accuracy of the three - term debye model @xmath43 is approximately the same as the accuracy of the corresponding cole - cole model .",
    "the parameters of the three - term debye model for the tissue used in the calculation are presented in table [ tab1 ] and the comparison between the two models is shown in figure [ dielectrics ] .",
    ".debye parameters for the tissues used in the computation .",
    "static conductivity @xmath40 is from reference ( gabriel c _ et al _ 1996 ) . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have performed full three dimensional fdtd calculations of the penetration of uwb electromagnetic pulses , authorized by the fcc for communications , radar imaging , and vehicle radars , into a human eye .",
    "calculations included as detailed geometrical description of the eye as necessary and as accurate description of the physical properties of the eye tissue as allowed by existing data .",
    "the spatial resolution of @xmath44 side length of the yee cell allowed reliable calculation of up to @xmath45 in frequency range in the dielectric .    to minimize the computation time",
    ", the electromagnetic interaction with dielectric material was modeled using the piecewise - linear recursive convolution method ( plrc ) for debye media .",
    "dielectric properties of the eye tissues in the frequency range @xmath46 were formulated in terms of the debye parametrization with the same accuracy as the accepted cole - cole parametrization .    the energy absorbed after the uwb exposure",
    "was evaluated over the entire eye volume and compared to the energy absorbed after the exposure to continuous electromagnetic waves .",
    "the energy in the material exposed to uwb electromagnetic radiation was absorbed in the same way as in the material exposed to a cw in the coresponding pulse frequency spectrum .",
    "we have found that , assuming the same field amplitude and the same exposure time , any possible dose dependent health effects as a results of the exposure to uwb radiation will be reduced by one to many orders of magnitude compared to the health effects caused by the exposure to cw .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the experiments carried out at the us air force research laboratory at brooks ( miller _ et al _ 2002 ) .",
    "we can conclude that , based on the research described in this paper , any future applications of uwb pulses , for the purposes and in the frequency range approved by the fcc , pose less health risk compared to those applications being carried by the continuous electromagnetic radiation .",
