    "in this article , we study a general two - player nonzero - sum stochastic differential game with impulse controls . more specifically , after setting the general framework , we investigate the notion of nash equilibrium and identify the corresponding system of quasi - variational inequalities ( qvis ) .",
    "moreover , we propose within this setting a model for competition in retail electricity markets and give a detailed analysis of its properties in both one - player and two - player cases .",
    "regarding general nonzero - sum impulse games , we consider a problem where two players can affect a continuous - time stochastic process @xmath0 by discrete - time interventions which consist in shifting @xmath0 to a new state ( when none of the players intervenes , we assume @xmath0 to diffuse according to a standard sde ) .",
    "each intervention corresponds to a cost for the intervening player and to a gain for the opponent .",
    "the strategy of player @xmath1 is determined by a couple @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a fixed subset of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a continuous function : player @xmath6 intervenes if and only if the process @xmath0 exits from @xmath3 and , when this happens , she shifts the process from state @xmath7 to state @xmath8 .",
    "once the strategies @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and a starting point @xmath7 have been chosen , a couple of impulse controls @xmath11 is uniquely defined : @xmath12 is the @xmath13-th intervention time of player @xmath6 and @xmath14 is the corresponding impulse",
    ". each player aims at maximizing her payoff , defined as follows : for every @xmath7 belonging to some fixed subset @xmath15 and every couple of strategies @xmath16 we set @xmath17,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the exit time of @xmath0 from @xmath21 .",
    "the couple @xmath22 is a nash equilibrium if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , for every couple of strategies @xmath25 .",
    "the game just described is connected to the following system of qvis , where @xmath18 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 are suitable intervention operators defined in section [ ssec : qvi ] : @xmath28 the main mathematical result of this paper is the verification theorem [ thm : verification ] : if two functions @xmath29 , with @xmath1 , are a solution to , have polynomial growth and satisfy the regularity condition @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath26 and @xmath32 , then they coincide with the value functions of the game and a characterization of the nash strategy is possible .",
    "we stress here that even if stochastic differential games have been widely studied in the last decades , the case of nonzero - sum impulse games has never been considered , to the best of our knowledge , from a qvi perspective .",
    "indeed , related former works only address zero - sum stopping games @xcite , the corresponding nonzero - sum problems @xcite ( with only two , very recent , explicit examples in @xcite and @xcite ) and zero - sum impulse games @xcite .",
    "we notice that the qvi formulated in @xcite for zero - sum impulse games are obtained as a particular case of our framework .",
    "only the two papers @xcite deal with some nonzero - sum stochastic differential games with impulse controls using an approach based on backward stochastic differential equations and the maximum principle .",
    "the second contribution of our paper is an application of the general setting to competition in retail electricity markets .",
    "since electricity market deregulation started twenty years ago , electricity retail markets have been mainly studied from the point of view of the regulation : joskow and tirole @xcite study the effect of the lack of hourly meters in households on retail competition , while von der fehr and hansen @xcite analyse the switching process of consumers in the norwegian market .    here",
    ", we are interested in the rationale behind the price policy of electricity retailers for which an illustration is given in figure [ fig : retail - uk ] in the case of the uk electricity markets",
    ". retailers tend to increase the household price when the wholesale price increases and to decrease the household price when the wholesale price decreases .",
    "since retailers change their price nearly at the same moment ( moments differ only by a few weeks ) , one can wonder if these changes are optimal or result in a non - competitive behaviour .",
    "this question is the reason why the british energy regulator launched an inquiry on energy retailers in 2014 .        in this paper , we propose to model the competition between two electricity retailers within the general setting of nonzero - sum impulse games , where it is rational for the retailers to increase or decrease their retail prices at discrete moments depending on the evolution of the wholesale price and of the competitor s choice .    in our model",
    ", we assume that retailers buy the energy on a single wholesale market without distinguishing the purchases on the forward market from those on the spot market .",
    "moreover , we suppose that retailers have the same sourcing cost ( the price of power on the wholesale market ) but may have different fixed cost ( i.e. different amount of commercials ) .",
    "we also suppose , for tractability reason , that the structure cost of each retailer is quadratic in her respective market share .",
    "finally , retailers sell electricity to their final consumers at a fixed price ( possibly different for each retailer ) .",
    "both retailers objective is to maximize their total expected discounted profits .",
    "their instantaneous profits are composed of three parts : sale revenue ( market share times retail price ) , sourcing cost ( market share times wholesale market price ) , and structure cost .",
    "the wholesale market price evolution is assumed to follow an arithmetic brownian motion for the sake of simplicity .",
    "this is also partly justified by the fact that negative spot prices for electricity are more and more frequent on various national european markets .",
    "a last important feature of our model is that retailers can not transfer continuously the variations of their sourcing cost to their clients .",
    "instead , they can only change their prices in discrete time .",
    "whenever a retailer changes her price , she faces a fixed cost .",
    "indeed , each time a retailer decides to change her price , she has to advertise it and to inform all her actual clients about that change .",
    "therefore , the problem naturally formulates as a nonzero - sum stochastic impulse control game .    under the guidance provided by the verification theorem established in the general setting , we provide a detailed analysis of nash equilibria of the retail impulse game .",
    "we focus on nash equilibria where each retailer keeps her price constant as long as the spread between her price and the wholesale price belongs to some region in the plane ( called non - intervention or continuation region ) .",
    "we conjecture that the non - intervention region of retailer @xmath6 consists of a ribbon in the plane , which is delimited by two curves .",
    "when the difference between her retail price and the wholesale price hits the boundary of the non - intervention region , the optimal intervention policy consists in instantaneously changing the retail price in order to come back to the interior of this region . within this class of nash equilibria , we obtain a system of algebraic equations that the parameters characterizing the equilibrium have to satisfy .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "section  [ sec : stochimpgame ] rigorously formulates the general impulse stochastic games , defines nash equilibria , provides the associated system of qvis and the corresponding verification theorem . in section",
    "[ sec : oneplayer ] we consider the retail management problem in a simple one - player framework , while in section [ sec : twoplayer ] we study the two - player model . finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
