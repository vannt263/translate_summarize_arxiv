    "our study includes the spin exchange interaction across the rungs of the spin ladders and is based on a ( nearly ) exactly solvable model .",
    "based on the soliton description , we discuss the phases and possible transitions between them . exactly solving for spin ladders gives better understanding of the correlations between phase excitations and topological defects , while comparing with some weak - coupling studies@xcite and mf results which partly addressed this issue@xcite .",
    "we use a @xmath0-@xmath1 model for two - leg ladders in the strongly(isotropically ) coupled regime in which the interchain interactions ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) are larger(equal ) than the intrachain interactions @xmath11 . introducing weak coupling between two - leg",
    "_ ladders _ is staightforward for even - leg ladder systems .",
    "recent studies@xcite have shown that ladder systems with an odd number of legs are conducting luttinger liquids in the odd - parity channel and spin liquids in the even parity channel@xcite .",
    "odd - legged ladders can be mapped to a single - chain system while even - legged ladders are equivalent to a double - chain ladder .",
    "an effective model for the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian is obtained as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is for nearest - neighbor ( @xmath14 ) interactions , @xmath15 is the leg index and @xmath16 is the spin @xmath17 index . in strongly coupled @xmath0-@xmath1 models with a large coulomb repulsion ( large @xmath18 and large @xmath19 , we impose the single - occupancy constraint @xmath20 at each site .",

    "the system has a zero - point fluctuation , in the dilute - soliton limit , the quantum fluctuation is dominated by the hard - core interaction between the spinless fermions@xcite .",

    "the system can develop superconducting channel@xcite .",
    "an excited spin phase generates magnons from triplets and solitons which propagate in the background of spin - density - wave(sdw ) .",
    "weak but finite anisotropy or spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry cause spin stiffness and low - energy excitations .",
    "the interplay of the excitation modes , such as order - preserving collective magnons and order - destroying topological solitons , may possibly lead to some long - range or intermediate - range order . considering the asymptotic behaviours shown from scaling equations ( appendix ) , a schematic phase diagram is given in fig .",

    "@xmath111 where the holon excitation spectrum @xmath112 is valid for @xmath113 from the luttinger sum rule . the charge phase with gapless excitation forms a tomonaga - luttinger ground state",
    "according to numerical works @xcite@xcite , holes have lower energies when they form pairs across the rungs of the ladders .",
    "thus , low - energy excitations include hole - hole pairs and hole - spin bound states ( with positive charge ) propagating along the ladder with a kinetic energy of about @xmath114 .",
    "these excitations as well as the fluctuations of hole pairs move against the lowest - energy background of charge - density wave(cdw ) .",
    "the holon speed is @xmath115 .",
    "the asymptotic electron green s function can be calculated from perturbation theory excluding the vertex corrections@xcite@xcite and is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 with a spinon velocity @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the propagator @xmath120 can be determined by convoluting the holon propagator and the spinon propagator and has no simple poles for low - energy states .",
    "thus , the fermi surfaces are considered separately for the holon and for the spinon .",
    "the size of the holon fermi surface is found from @xmath121 ( @xmath122 being the doping concentration ) .",
    "the ground state of the half - filled insulator is a disordered ( or dimerized ) spin liquid made of spin singlets .",
    "these singlets which form across the rungs become spin triplets as they are excited .",
    "also , the triplets can propagate along the ladder as well as along the chain .",
    "the propagation @xmath123 the rungs and ladders are  incoherent \" in the sense that there is no stable eigenstate for the electron .",
    "the quantum numbers , such as spin , charge , and momentum , are not the same throughout the propagation from one leg to another@xcite . as separated phase fields ,",
    "the charge and the spin degrees of freedom propagate with different speeds . at small lengths ,",
    "the phase separation may manifest itself spatially in real space , for example as striped phases , as discussed by some authors@xcite . to see whether there is any strong - coupled fixed point , consider turning off the interchain hopping @xmath124 .",
    "the renormalization group(rg ) dimension of the wavefunction comes from rescaling the variables @xmath125 . from the propagator",
    ", we have @xmath126 .",
    "so , the hamiltonian @xmath127 has the rg dimension of @xmath128 .",
    "the interchain hopping is irrelevant and the luttinger liquid becomes a fixed point , if and only if @xmath129 .",
    "this corresponds to the case of interchain interactions being much weaker than intrachain ones ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "however , in strongly coupled ladders , @xmath131 remains sufficiently large to develop gaps@xcite@xcite and rg flow is away from the unstable luttinger liquid fixed point@xcite .",
    "given that @xmath124 is greater than the spin gap , there is no strong - coupled fixed point , for even - legged ladders(@xmath132 .",
    "the equal - time spin - spin correlation is a power - law form @xmath133 which shows the spinons being a non - fermi liquid . from second - order perturbation theory@xcite ,",
    "the spin gap size is @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "in the 2d af heisenberg model or @xmath136 model , deconfinement of the electron ( to a holon and spinon ) occurs at @xmath137@xcite . as for spin - ladder systems ,",
    "the `` electron '' phase is realized by having the spin and the charge phases confined at finite @xmath138 above the transition temperature @xmath139 . since the confinement - deconfinement(cd ) transition occurs in the absence of ordering , it is like a kosterlitz - thouless transition occuring in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional system . from the partition function , @xmath139 is found @xmath140 } < t_{cd } < { \\delta_{\\parallel } t_{\\parallel}-j_{\\parallel}\\over k[\\delta_\\perp t_{\\perp}-j_{\\perp}]}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is boltzmann constant . hence , for @xmath142 , the electron propagator has the product form @xmath143 .",
    "below @xmath139 , the spin phase and the charge phase are separated due to the screening of the confining potential between holons and spinons .",
    "spin - charge separation is a well - accepted fact for 1d systems which are luttinger liquids .",
    "spin ladders make transition , at some doping rates @xmath122 , to a luttinger liquid phase , where both spin and charge excitations become gapless .",
    "in summary , we map the spinons to solitons which are either magnons ( excitons when bound ) or excited phasons . from the soliton gap",
    ", we have the spin - gapped mode while the charge part is gapless luttinger liquid .",
    "as the doping increases the ladders can develop superconducting phase or lose the spin gap beyond certain hole concentration .",
    "also , depending on the ratio of interchain couplings to intraleg interactions , the spin ladders can become gapless luttinger liquid .",
    "our phase diagram is consistent with the features found in mf studies or weak - coupling approaches , such as presence of gapless mode and superconducting phase from even - ladders .",
    "the comprehensive diagram shows possible transitions as an explicit function of coupling ratio and doping .",
    "the electron propagator and the spin - spin correlation obey power - laws with the exponents depending on the interaction strengths and the doping rate .",
    "this shows the correlation of topological defects and phase excitations .",
    "constructive interferences of phase excitations ( solitons and magnons ) may lead to the formation of intermediate - range or long range order , which is our forthcoming study .",
    "the electron is seen as a confined phase of the gauge flux associated with each point . below the estimated transition temperature ,",
    "the spin phase and the charge phase are separated .",
    "henceforth , even - ladders show the crossover from gapped 2d - like states to gapless 1d - nature , depending on the interleg couplings and/or the doping rate .",
