    "the second term in the single - particle part of the hamiltonian is added for mere convenience so that @xmath24 corresponds to the point of particle - hole symmetry ( half filling of the central site 2 in equilibrium ) .",

    "the linear geometry and the coupling of sites 1 and 3 to the leads implies a specific coupling of these three energy levels .    in ref .",

    "we have studied the dynamics of the dot occupancy and the current resulting out of abrupt quenches and smooth parameter changes in the irlm and variants of this .",
    "the time evolution shows characteristics which depend on the protocol with which the different parameters are varied in time .",
    "in particular , correlations can lead to a rich dynamics showing interesting effects which go beyond the renormalization of the decay rate found in the standard protocol ( i ) . using our approximate functional rg approach",
    "we were able to identify and explain several of those .",
    "our method is very flexible , can be used for all time scales , and other time dependences of the model parameters than the ones considered here can be treated as well .",
    "we exemplified the role of initial correlations and determined the difference between the dynamics resulting out of switching - on the level - lead coupling in the presence of a finite bias voltage and the experimentally more relevant case of turning - on the bias voltage in an equilibrium state with coupled leads .",
    "we thank s.  jakobs and c.  karrasch for collaborations in the initial state of this work as well as k.  schnhammer and h.  schoeller for valuable discussions .",

    "<S> we study the relaxation dynamics of a quantum dot with local coulomb correlations coupled to two noninteracting leads which are held in grandcanonical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> only charge degrees of freedom are considered and the dot is described by a model which in the scaling limit becomes equivalent to the interacting resonant level model . the time evolution of the current and dot occupancy resulting out of changes of the dot - lead coupling , the dots onsite energy , or the charging energy are studied . </S>",
    "<S> abrupt and smooth parameter changes as well as setups with and without driving bias voltage are considered . for biased dots we investigate the often studied response after turning on the dot - lead coupling but also the experimentally more relevant case in which the voltage is turned on . </S>",
    "<S> we identify and explain a variety of interesting many - body effects and clarify the role of initial correlations . </S>"
