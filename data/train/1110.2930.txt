    "models with chiral fourth generation fermions are among the simplest and well - motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) and have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "the condition for cp symmetry violation in the sm requires at least three generations of fermions  @xcite . however , there is no upper limit on the number of generations from the first principle . in the sm",
    "the amount of cp violation is not large enough to explain the baryon - antibaryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "the inclusion of fourth generation quarks leads to two extra cp phases in quark sector and possible larger cp violation  @xcite , which is helpful for electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "with very massive quarks in the fourth generation , it has been proposed that the electroweak symmetry breaking may become a dynamical feature of the sm  @xcite .",
    "the recent lhc and tevatron experiments have imposed constraints on the mass of the fourth generation quarks from possible pair production processes . for instance , the lower limit on the mass of the fourth generation up - type quark @xmath3 is found to be @xmath4 from the search for the process @xmath5 , and the limit on the mass of the fourth generation down - type quark @xmath6 is @xmath7 from the process",
    "@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the direct searches for extra quarks at tevatron have set lower limits on the masses of @xmath3 to be @xmath9 gev , with the assumption that the mass splitting between @xmath10 and the fourth generation down quark @xmath11 is smaller than the @xmath12 mass and the branching ratio of @xmath13 is 100@xmath14  @xcite .",

    "note that these limits are obtained with the assumptions of maximum mixing between the fourth and the third generation quarks and @xmath20 branching ratio of the decay processes .",

    ", the production of the higgs boson can be enhanced by a factor of 5 - 9 due to the presence of two additional fourth generation quarks in the one - loop gluon - gluon fusion process . in a combined analysis of atlas and cms ,",

    "note that for a higgs boson heavier than 600 gev , the self - interaction of the higgs boson may be very strong and even nonperturbative , while a higgs boson lighter than 120 gev may cause the problem of vacuum instability if the sm with fourth generation is valid up to the planck scale .",
    "the constraints on the masses of the fourth generation leptons are much weaker .",
    "the current lower bound on the mass of the unstable fourth generation charged lepton @xmath27 is @xmath28 gev from the search for @xmath27 decaying into the fourth generation neutrino @xmath29 and @xmath30 boson . from the invisible width of @xmath31 boson ,",
    "the lower bounds for the mass of an unstable @xmath29 is set to be @xmath32 gev from the decay @xmath33 in the case that @xmath29 is of dirac type .",

    "heavy stable neutrinos with mass greater than @xmath37 gev are possible candidates for the cold dm @xcite . however ,",
    "if the neutrino is the dominant component of the halo dm , the current dm direct search experiments have imposed strong constraints on its mass . for instance , it has been shown that the spin - independent ( si ) cross sections for the stable dirac neutrino elastic scattering off nucleus can be a few order of magnitudes larger than the current dm direct search upper bounds due to the @xmath31 and @xmath21 exchanges  @xcite . in the case of majorana neutrino , the spin - dependent ( sd )",
    "cross sections for the elastic scattering can be very large .",
    "previous analysis based on the assumption that the majorana neutrino dominates the local halo dm density have ruled out the mass range @xmath38 from the upper bounds on the sd cross section  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the majorana neutrino is also constrained from si scattering through @xmath21-exchange if it has both dirac and majorana mass terms in the flavor basis  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is well - known that for a neutrino heavier than @xmath39 , the cross section for its annihilation is in general too large to reproduce the observed dm relic density . if the heavy neutrino mass is in the range @xmath40 , the annihilation into light fermion pairs @xmath41 through @xmath42-channel @xmath31 exchange contributes to a very large cross section . for the neutrino heavier than @xmath43 ,",

    "for these processes the corresponding cross section does not decrease with the increasing of the neutrino mass , resulting in a relic density always decreases with the growing of the neutrino mass , and a thermal relic density far below the observed total dm relic density  @xcite .",
    "since the neutrino dm can only contribute to a small fraction of the relic density of dm , it is expected that it contributes to a small fraction of the halo dm density as well , and the two fractions are of the same order of magnitude . from model building point of view , it is easy to construct multi - component dm models with the heavy neutrino being a subdominant component in the halo . despite its very low number density in the halo",
    ", it can still be probed by the underground dm direct detection experiments due to its strong coupling to the target nuclei , which provides a way to search for new physics beyond the sm complementary to the lhc . in this case , the event rate of the dm - nucleus elastic scattering will depend on both the relic density and the cross section for the elastic scattering process .",
    "since both of them have nontrivial dependence on the neutrino mass , the above mentioned constraints on the neutrino dm could be modified significantly .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the consequence of this possibility in a model with a fourth generation majorana neutrino dm . the stability of the fourth majorana neutrino protected by an additional generation - dependent @xmath2 gauge symmetry . in the model",
    "the gauge - anomalies generated by the first three generation fermions are canceled by the ones from the fourth generation .",
    "we perform an updated analysis of the majorana neutrino dm in light of the recent higgs search results at the lhc and the recent dm direct detection results such as xenon100 and simple etc .. the relic density of the neutrino dm is obtained by calculating the annihilation cross sections for all the possible final states such as @xmath41 , @xmath44 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 etc .. under the assumption that the neutrino contributes to the same fraction of the local halo dm density as that of dm relic density in the universe , we calculate the effective dm - nucleus elastic scattering cross sections which are the cross sections rescaled by the fraction of the halo dm density contributed by the heavy majorana neutrino .",
    "the results show that the current xenon100 data constrain the mass of the majorana neutrino to be greater than @xmath49 . in the mass range from @xmath50 to a few hundred gev",

    "range the predicted spin - dependent cross section for neutrino proton scattering is in the range @xmath52 , which is within the reach of the ongoing icecube experiment .",
    "although the analysis is performed in a specific model , the results are valid for a wide range of models with heavy majorana neutrino dm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows , in section [ model ] , we present the details of the model with stable fourth generation majorana neutrino and the interactions relevant to the calculation of the relic density and dm - nucleus elastic scattering cross sections . in section [ relic - density ] , we calculate the relic density of majorana neutrino dm . in section [ scattering ] , we give the prediction for spin - independent and spin - dependent cross sections for the heavy neutrino elastic scattering off nucleon and compared them with the latest dm search experiments .",

    "the gauge symmetry @xmath53 is to be spontaneously broken by the higgs mechanism . for this purpose",
    "we introduce two sm singlet scalar fields @xmath73 which carry the @xmath53 charges @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "the @xmath53 charges of @xmath73 are arranged such that @xmath76 can have majorana type of yukawa couplings to the right - handed neutrinos of the first three generations @xmath77 while @xmath78 only couples to the fourth generation neutrino @xmath79 .",

    "thus @xmath87 obtains mass only from the vevs of the scalars @xmath88 and it does not mix with @xmath31 boson in mass term at tree level .",
