    "the cell is a structural and functional unit , the building block of any living system .",
    "cells consist of a membrane , made of a lipid bilayer , which encloses and protects the contents of the cell , including genetic material .",
    "the membrane is semi - permeable : nutrients can diffuse in and serve as energy to support the functioning of the machinery  @xcite .",
    "cells undergo replication ( cell division ) : this is a process by which a cell , hereafter called the parent cell , divides into two or more cells , called the daughters .",
    "the daughter cell contains in principle an exact replica of the parent s inner constituents , this property being ultimately a prerequisite for stable living organisms to exist .",
    "such a process clearly relies on the synchronization between the duplication rate of the constituents and the growth of the container . in modern cells",
    "this condition is of paramount importance and is efficiently realized via dedicated control mechanisms , expressed as pathways of nested molecular checkpoints  @xcite .",
    "this complex and delicate machinery has evolved ; presumably the first minimalistic cells ( so - called protocells  @xcite-@xcite ) had a far more straightforward and less elaborate way of dividing .",
    "so focusing on the primordial cell units postulated to be present at the origin of life on earth , can we conceive of a simple , though efficient , mechanism which could govern the division process ?",
    "a possible answer to this question will emerge as a result of the calculations carried out in this paper .",
    "one of the most persuasive scenarios concerning the origin of life on earth identifies vesicles as protocells  @xcite .",
    "these are tiny closed sacs in which the outer membrane takes the form of a lipid bilayer , and so are good candidates for a minimal cell . despite the dramatic reduction in complexity",
    "as compared to modern cells , vesicles still display many fascinating properties , as revealed in laboratory experiments  @xcite .",
    "they are semi - permeable and allow for different types of chemicals to enter the enclosed volume , and so sustain any reaction cycles that may be taking place .",
    "in addition , vesicles can grow due to inclusion of lipid constituents into their surface , progressively adjust their shape , and eventually divide to produce daughter vesicles .",
    "vesicles which are initially spherical can pass through a number of intermediate shapes before they divide , for instance a vesicle may first change into an ellipsoid , then into a dumbbell shape and finally into two attached spheres , at which point it will divide in two  @xcite .",
    "however it must be said there is in reality very little theoretical evidence that the shape of the vesicle always follows this particular sequence , and even less experimental evidence",
    ". it may be more appropriate to talk about an ensemble of vesicles and typical pathways to the state where division takes place .",
    "similarly there may only be a mean time to division , although it should be noted that there would then be a selection process which would favor the types of vesicles ( if they could be distinguished ) which would undergo the division proceeding at the fastest rate .",
    "when modeling protocells , one needs to relate the mechanism of growth and division to the actual microscopic dynamics of the internal constituents . while vesicles can possibly define the scaffold of prototypical cell models , what can one say about the internal constituents",
    "it is customarily believed that autocatalytic reactions  @xcite might have had a role in producing complex molecules required for the origin of life  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a chemical reaction is called autocatalytic if one of the reaction products is itself a catalyst for the chemical reaction .",
    "clearly the reaction will speed up as more catalyst is produced .",
    "if there are several catalytic reactions , rather than just one  an autocatalytic set  @xcite  then more complex behavior is possible , with some reactions producing catalysts for other reactions .",
    "this suggests that the interior of the protocell might have been occupied by interacting families of replicators , organized in autocatalytic cycles .",
    "autocatalytic reactions have also been invoked in the context of studies on the origin of life as a possible solution of the famous eigen paradox  @xcite .",
    "this is a puzzle , since it limits the size of self - replicating molecules to perhaps a few hundred base pairs . at odds with this conclusion",
    ", almost all life on earth requires much longer molecules to encode their genetic information .",
    "this problem is dealt with in living cells by the presence of enzymes which repair mutations , allowing the encoding molecules to reach sizes on the order of millions of base pairs  @xcite . in primordial organisms , autocatalytic cycles",
    "might have provided the required degree of microscopic cooperation to prevent eigen s evolutionary drive to self - destruction to occur .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the properties of autocatalytic reactions within a bounded region of space , which we will identify with the vesicle , the whole structure being a reference model for a protocell .",
    "the autocatalytic reactions will be taken to have the form proposed by togashi and kaneko  @xcite . in their work ,",
    "togashi and kaneko emphasized the role played by the noise intrinsic to the system of elementary constituents .",
    "this model was recently revisited by dauxois et al .",
    "@xcite , who used an approach based on expanding the master equation in a system - size expansion  @xcite , to make analytic progress in the description of the process .",
    "this approach has recently been applied to a number of processes in biological systems to show how large oscillations can emerge , sustained by the stochastic component of the dynamics  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the analysis has also been extended to a spatial model  @xcite , and our calculations will mirror those in this paper .    therefore here we will ask what happens once space ( i.e. microscopic particle diffusion ) is incorporated into the model .",
    "are the oscillations robust or , conversely , do they get washed out through coarse - grained averaging ?",
    "we shall demonstrate that spatio - temporal patterns do emerge and influence the mass transport inside the cell .",
    "we will also speculate that the division of the protocell requires an inherent degree of synchronization which may be triggered by collective , spatially ordered fluctuations in the concentration . building on this scenario",
    ", one can imagine that localized peaks in the concentration might develop at a given stage of the vesicle evolution .",
    "denser patches could then drive an instability which could potentially lead to the distortion of the membrane and so to division .",
    "the model we will use is a spatial version of the autocatalytic model discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to introduce a spatial coarse - graining and divide the vesicle into small micro - cells , within which autocatalytic reactions occur .",
    "the cells adjoining the membrane which forms the limit of the vesicle have a special status , since the membrane allows chemicals to diffuse in from the environment and out into the environment . in this paper",
    "we will focus only on these micro - cells  those that are adjacent to the boundary  and lump all the interior micro - cells together into an inner region .",
    "we do not give the environment or this inner region any spatial structure ; they simply act as a particle reservoir for the chemicals in the micro - cells adjacent to the membrane .    in each micro - cell autocatalytic reactions as specified in  @xcite occur , see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "more specifically we consider @xmath0 chemical species , here labeled @xmath1 , with the index @xmath2 labeling the species and @xmath3 , the @xmath4 micro - cells where the reactions occur .",

    "the spatial element of the model is introduced through migration of chemical species between neighboring cells .",
    "the boundary cells will form a periodic structure in two dimensions , so that a fourier - based approach can be used in the analysis described below . the geometry is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , in a two - dimensional setting , so that the micro - cells form a one - dimensional periodic structure .",
    "it should be emphasized that although the scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] with reference to a two - dimensional vesicle for simplicity , the setting and analysis apply in any spatial dimension including the relevant three - dimensional case .",
    "if the vesicle is @xmath7-dimensional , clearly the micro - cells will form a @xmath8-dimensional periodic structure .",
    "the migration between adjacent cells is encapsulated in the following relations @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 label the adjacent cells and @xmath13 represents the number of vacancies in cell @xmath14 .",
    "we will assume that the capacity of each cell is @xmath15 , so that sum of the number of molecules of each species plus the number of vacancies equals @xmath15 for every cell .",
    "finally , cell @xmath11 may lose a molecule @xmath1 to the environment or inner region leaving a vacancy @xmath16 or a gain of a molecule @xmath1 from the environment or inner region , i.e. @xmath17 there is no need to distinguish between the environment and inner region ; the rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 can simply be regarded as the combined rates for both processes . in the rest of the paper we will simply refer to both these regions as `` the environment '' .",

    "the above description is exact ; no approximations have yet been made . at this stage",
    "we could also resort to direct numerical simulations of the chemical reaction system by use of the gillespie algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this method produces realizations of the stochastic dynamics which are formally equivalent to those found from the master equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "averaging over many realizations enables us to calculate quantities of interest .",
    "we will discuss the results of performing such simulations in section [ secondorder ] , but a very accurate approximation scheme exists which can be used to investigate models of this type analytically .",
    "this is the van kampen system - size expansion  @xcite .",
    "it is effectively an expansion in powers of @xmath51 , which to leading order ( @xmath52 ) gives the deterministic equations describing the system , and which at next - to - leading order gives finite @xmath15 corrections to these .",
    "these latter corrections take the form of _ linear _ stochastic differential equations which can then be analyzed straightforwardly , especially in the case when the deterministic system has approached a stable fixed point .",
    "the method is based on substituting the ansatz @xmath53 into the master equation ( [ master ] ) . here",
    "@xmath54 is the solution to the deterministic equation , and @xmath55 is a stochastic term which is the difference between the actual value @xmath56 and @xmath57 at time @xmath39 .",

    "we carry out the analysis to leading order , finding the deterministic equations and the relevant fixed point . in section [ secondorder ]",
    "we carry through the calculation to next - to - leading order , investigating the linear stochastic differential equations by taking their fourier transforms .",
    "the derivations of these equations is lengthy , though straightforward , and the details of the expansion are provided in appendices [ vk ] and [ mandb ] .",
    "in the limit where the number of molecules ( including vacancies ) in each micro - cell , @xmath15 , goes to infinity , the system becomes deterministic and is governed by a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "these are found by substituting the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) into the master equation ( [ master ] ) and letting @xmath52 , after the introduction of a rescaled time @xmath58 .",
    "the calculation is described in appendix [ vk ] , but the same equation can also be found by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) by @xmath59 and summing over all states @xmath29 .",
    "either way one obtains the following equation for species @xmath24 in cell @xmath11 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the discrete laplacian operator @xmath62 . in the limit where the size of the micro - cells tends to zero ,",
    "these equations become partial differential equations , with @xmath61 becoming the familiar laplacian operator . in this respect , eq .",
    "( [ eq : first_order ] ) generalizes the results of @xcite to the case of a spatially - extended system .",
    "when turning off the migration mechanism between neighboring micro - cells , i.e. imposing @xmath63 for any species @xmath24 , the spatial aspects drop out and one formally recovers the ordinary differential equations given in @xcite .    to proceed with the analysis , and to make contact with",
    "the investigation carried out in @xcite , we shall now assign the same chemical parameters to all the species .",
    "the migration rate is the only exception to this , and may have a different value for each species .",
    "we will see later that this will be necessary in order to find spatio - temporal oscillations but also , as we will see shortly , a straightforward analysis is still possible if we maintain in @xmath64 , and none of the other parameters , an explicit reference to the index @xmath24 .",
    "we will be concerned with finding the homogeneous solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : first_order ] ) , that is , the solution with no spatial variation .",
    "the homogeneous solution is found to be an attractor of the deterministic dynamics , even when the system is initially prepared in a non - homogeneous configuration .",
    "this observation follows from numerical simulations , but can in principle be made quantitative by investigating the stability of the homogeneous fixed point .",
    "this means that no gradient in concentration is allowed between neighboring micro - cells , once the asymptotic regime is attained .",
    "so , when searching for fixed points of the dynamics , one can set the terms involving the laplacian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : first_order ] ) to zero .",
    "since the only dependence on @xmath24 , appearing in @xmath64 , multiplies these terms , there is also no dependence remaining on the species type , @xmath24 , and so the fixed points are both independent of @xmath11 and of @xmath24 . under these conditions a unique fixed point for the concentration , @xmath65 , is easily found to be @xmath66 for any @xmath67 and @xmath3 .",
    "the result ( [ stationary ] ) is identical to that obtained in @xcite , when dealing with the non - spatial homologous model .    in @xcite",
    ", fluctuations for finite @xmath15 were shown to induce regular temporal oscillations in the species populations , so significantly altering the predicted deterministic dynamics .",
    "what is going to happen in the present spatial context ?",
    "in section [ secondorder ] we shall investigate this , the central point of the paper , by focusing on the next - to - leading order corrections in the van kampen expansion .",
    "equating the terms of next - to - leading order in the master equation , after rescaling the time , leads to the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : fp_sp ] ) which governs the probability density function of the fluctuations . this fokker - planck equation is formally equivalent to the following langevin equation  @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 the noise term , @xmath70 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) is gaussian with zero mean and with a correlator given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) , from which it can be seen to be white .",
    "the form of the two matrices @xmath71 and @xmath72 are discussed in appendix [ mandb ] .",
    "they depend on the solution of the deterministic equation @xmath73 , and so in principle are time - dependent , since @xmath57 is . however , in practice we are interested in fluctuations about the stationary state , @xmath65 , and",
    "so they lose their time dependence .",
    "they also only have a non - trivial spatial dependence through the presence of the discrete laplacian , because the stationary state is homogeneous .",
    "therefore the calculation can be considerably simplified by taking the spatial fourier transform of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda ] ) . as discussed in appendix [ mandb ] this gives ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 and where @xmath76 is the wavevector .",

    "( [ ftofm])-([m^s_sr ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ ftofb])-([b^s_sr ] ) respectively .",
    "however the important point is that now @xmath76 is simply a label and the matrix structure originating from the spatial nature of the problem has been lost .",
    "thus both @xmath79 and @xmath80 are simply @xmath81 matrices ( recall that @xmath0 is the number of chemical species ) and the analysis from now on is as in the non - spatial case  @xcite .    as we have already stressed in this paper , fluctuations about the stationary state need to be taken into account , since they can be significant even if @xmath15 is quite large .",
    "the fact we can investigate these systematically is crucially dependent on the linearity of eq .",
    "( [ langevin_k ] ) and that the @xmath79 and @xmath80 matrices are time - independent .",

    "the peak is approximately located at @xmath93 , in agreement with the analysis developed in @xcite .",
    "another simple limit is when the @xmath64 are made equal for all of the @xmath0 chemical species . in this case",
    ", the temporal peak gets progressively damped at large @xmath76 , the effect being more pronounced the larger the values for the migration parameters .",
    "a similar phenomenon was also reported to occur in @xcite .    more interestingly , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ana4 ] , we show the theoretical power spectrum eq .",

    "a localized peak is clearly displayed suggesting that organized spatio - temporal patterns can spontaneously emerge , due to the inherent stochasticity of the system . from an inspection of figs .",

    "in this paper we have investigated how the discreteness of the constituents in an autocatalytic chemical reaction can lead to spatio - temporal oscillations .",
    "the occurrence of temporal oscillations in such a setting , but without a spatial element , has previously been studied  @xcite . similarly , such oscillations have been studied for a predator - prey system in a spatial framework  @xcite , but the oscillations in this case did not occur at a non - zero value of @xmath76 . in this paper , we have combined and generalized these treatments , and also put them into the context of vesicles , which suggests an interesting consequence of the oscillatory behavior .",
    "we can speculate that the natural tendency of the chemical constituents to organize in regular spatio - temporal cycles can be instrumental in achieving a degree of synchronization between the outer membrane of the vesicle and the mixture of chemicals inside . in the context of protocells",
    ", these chemicals undergoing autocatalytic reactions are to be interpreted as a primitive form of genetic material",
    ". one would expect , as a minimal self - consistency requirement , that within a stable population , a vesicle would split into two when the chemical material contained within it had approximately doubled in size .",
    "it is tempting to postulate that such a property is a dynamical phenomenon , the density fluctuations acting as a positive feedback on the vesicle growth , so signaling when the constituents inside the vesicle are ready for the splitting to take place .",
    "now let us imagine that the vesicle containing the chemical species grows , because of the inclusion of successive membrane constituents from the environment in which it moves .",
    "laboratory experiments indicate  @xcite that a vesicle filled with water or solutes is kept in a turgid spherical shape while growing by additional material of a similar kind flowing in from the outside environment .",
    "it is believed that the vesicle remains spherical until a thermodynamic instability sets in which distorts the structure  @xcite , eventually leading to fissioning .",
    "now suppose that the vesicle is filled by a discrete population of chemical constituents , which undergo an independent dynamics of the autocatalytic type . as illustrated in this paper , the chemicals experience a first rapid evolution towards the stationary state , where enhanced oscillations appear due to the intrinsic finiteness of the interacting constituents .",
    "such oscillations might seed an instability  @xcite , which could resonate with the innate ability of the container to divide , so initiating the splitting process .",
    "these ideas could be extended to protocells , where enhanced oscillations could originate in the primitive genetic material .",
    "these oscillations could signal to the membrane that the genetic evolution had been virtually taken to completion and that the fission could now occur , so ensuring that the genetic material is passed on to the daughter protocells .",
    "this is a highly speculative suggestion , which calls for further investigation in the context of self - consistent formulations , where both the membrane and the genetic material are dynamically evolved .",
