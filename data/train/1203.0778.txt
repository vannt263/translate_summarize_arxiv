    "diffusion dynamics of hard - core interacting particles in one dimension ( 1d ) is known as the single - file diffusion ( sfd ) .",
    "the sfd occurs for instance in narrow biological pores@xcite , inside the zeolites@xcite , during the sliding of proteins along the dna@xcite .",
    "other examples comprise migration of adsorbed molecules on surfaces@xcite , diffusion in nanotubes@xcite , carrier migration in polymers and superionic conductors@xcite .",
    "advances in technology now allow to study artificial single - file systems such as solid - state nanopores@xcite , confined colloid particles@xcite , charged spheres in circular channel@xcite , or millimetric steel balls in plane condenser@xcite . in all these systems , the mutual passage of the particles is forbidden which results in deviation of tagged particle s dynamics from the classical diffusion .",
    "the concept of sfd was first introduced in the mathematical literature by harris@xcite .",
    "he proved that the mean - square displacement of the tagged particle increases with time as @xmath2 in contrast to its linear increase for the free particle . for a comprehensible review of the present state of the art in the theory of sfd cf .",
    "introduction in ref .  ) . despite the long history of sfd phenomena ,",
    "exactly solvable models of single - file systems are rare and they have occurred only recently .",
    "the exact solution of the diffusion equation for @xmath1 hard - core interacting particles has been first derived in ref .   for the diffusion on an infinite line ( it has been rederived in ref .  ) .",
    "the sfd of @xmath1 particles within the finite interval has been solved through the bethe ansatz in ref .  .",
    "in ref .  , the present authors have generalized the previously known exact solutions to the case of an arbitrary time- and space - dependent force acting on particles .",
    "all these exact solutions can describe real physical situations , however , they all concern the systems with a conserved number of particles",
    ". often the opposite is true and the single - file systems should be treated as open systems with _",
    "variable _ number of particles .",
    "many such systems are listed in the first paragraph .",
    "the single - file conditions in combination with a variable number of particles are two prerequisites for a proper understanding of kinetics of diffusion - limited catalytic reaction in crowded environments@xcite .",
    "also the search for corrections to smoluchowski theory which would incorporate the effects of excluded volume@xcite stimulates the interest in one - dimensional models@xcite with hard - core interaction and particle absorption .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the only work that presents analytical study of dynamics of a tagged particle in an open system is ref .   where the finite interval with two perfectly absorbing boundaries was briefly discussed .",
    "however , the approximative tagged particle probability density function ( pdf ) obtained in the thermodynamic limit was only considered . in the present paper",
    "we develop a new general formalism that allows an exact analytical treatment of the sfd problem with the absorbing boundary ( such boundary can represent , e.g. , the open end of the biological pore , a fixed reactant , a binding site inside the pore , etc . ) .",
    "the approach is a logical outgrowth of our earlier method@xcite and its characteristic feature is that the exact solution of the sfd problem can be given whenever the exact solution of the corresponding single - particle problem is known .",
    "formally , our analysis is based on a hierarchical system of coupled generalized diffusion equations describing the evolution periods when the pore contains a definite number of particles .",
    "we were able to solve the hierarchy .",
    "the solution yields the complete information concerning the many - particle dynamics .",
    "the physical consequences of the particle interaction manifest themselves most transparently if we follow the motion of an individual tagged particle .",
    "we were able to derive the exact expression for the tagged particle pdf and for its survival probability .",

    "differently speaking , the mass transport out of the pore is not affected by the hard - core interaction .",

    "[ fig : survival ] illustrates the tagged particle survival probability @xmath171 for different @xmath170 , together with the single - particle survival probability @xmath30 .",
    "several observations are worth emphasizing .",
    "first of all , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ rozdils ] ) that the function @xmath171 are ordered as @xmath177 where the equalities hold at @xmath11 ( all @xmath1 particles are initially inside the pore , thus all @xmath178 ) and in the limit @xmath179 .",
    "each hard - core particle acts on the adjacent ones as a moving ( fluctuating ) reflecting boundary .",
    "for example , the exit of the rightmost particle is hindered by the remaining @xmath50 particles which greatly increases its survival probability @xmath180 .",
    "effectively , the collisions between the particles induce _ entropic repulsive forces_. the leftmost particle is pushed by the remaining ones towards the pore s boundary which significantly reduces its lifetime inside the pore ; its survival probability @xmath181 rapidly decreases to zero . as a direct consequence of eq .",
    "( [ sumdens ] ) we obtain @xmath182 which relates the arithmetic mean of tagged particles survival probabilities to the survival probability of the single - diffusing particle .",
    "hence @xmath180 always exceeds @xmath30 but their difference @xmath183 vanishes as @xmath184 .",
    "the above consideration manifest themselves most pronouncedly if we consider the time - asymptotic behavior of the survival probabilities .",
    "each @xmath171 tends to zero , i.e. , each particle will certainly exit the pore .",
    "the long - time asymptotics of the individual @xmath171 can be obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ survn ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath185 where @xmath162 has the same meaning as in eq .",
    "( [ sdecay ] ) . in words ,",
    "each survival probabilities exhibits again a power - law decay . however , the decay exponent depends on the particle s order @xmath79 and it _ does not _ depend on the total number of particles .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 enters just through the constant prefactor of the power law .",
    "this can be understood on physical grounds .",
    "notice that the survival probability of the rightmost particle @xmath180 decays as @xmath186 , i.e. , with the same dynamical exponent as @xmath30 ( cf .",
    "( [ sdecay ] ) ) .",
    "indeed , in the long - time limit it is highly probable that all other particles have already escaped and thus the initially rightmost particle behaves as a free one .",
    "this is also why the total number of particles @xmath1 does not enter the exponents of @xmath171 , for an arbitrary @xmath79 . after a `` long enough '' time",
    ", the @xmath187 particles which were initially to the left of the @xmath79-th one have already escaped .",
    "thus , irrespective of @xmath1 , the @xmath79-th particle behaves as if it were the leftmost one in the system of @xmath79 particles . the total number of particles @xmath1 specifies only the expression `` long enough '' in the above reasoning .",
    "finally , let us return to the mapping which has been developed in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : mapping ] where we have discussed the analogy between our sfd problem and the diffusion of a single compound particle in the @xmath1-dimensional space .",
    "initially , the compound particle departs from a general interior point in the @xmath1-dimensional wedge domain .",
    "the exit of the leftmost particle has been translated to the adsorption of the compound particle onto the @xmath188-dimensional absorbtion hyperplane .",
    "then the compound particle continues to diffuse within this hyperplane until its motion is further restricted onto the @xmath189-dimensional absorbtion hyperplane , and so on .",
    "the function @xmath171 equals the probability that , at the time @xmath24 , the motion of the compound particle has not been restricted onto the @xmath190-dimensional hyperplane , yet .",

    "( [ rozdils ] ) yields the probability that , at the time @xmath24 , the compound particle diffuses in the interior of the @xmath79-dimensional wedge domain . on the whole , as a byproduct , we have solved a nontrivial problem concerning the geometrically restricted @xmath1-dimensional diffusion .      the survival probability @xmath171 ( eq .  ( [ survn ] ) )",
    "provides complete information about the escape process of the @xmath79-th particle .",
    "the pdf @xmath193 of the @xmath79-th particle s _ exit time _ is given by@xcite @xmath194 hence all the moments of the exit time can be obtained from @xmath171 .",
    "it follows from the long - time properties of @xmath171 ( cf .",
    "( [ snasymptotics ] ) ) that @xmath195 consequently , the mean exit time of the @xmath79-th particle , @xmath196 is infinite for @xmath197 .",
    "the integral ( [ escapetime ] ) becomes finite for @xmath198 and its convergence does not depend on the total number of particles initially located in the pore .",
    "@xmath1 only modifies the magnitude of the mean exit time ( if the latter exists ) .",
    "similarly , the second moment of the exit time @xmath199 only exists for @xmath200 .",
    "the above analysis brings us to an interesting comparison between the escape process confined by the static and by the fluctuating reflecting boundaries , respectively . considering the semi - infinite interval with the absorbing boundary at the origin",
    ", the survival probability @xmath30 of the single - diffusing particle decays to zero as the power law ( [ sdecay ] ) and the mean exit time is infinite .",
    "if we add the _ static _ reflecting boundary on the right of the single - diffusing particle , the diffusion will be confined to an interval of a finite length .",
    "then the survival probability decays exponentially and , consequently , the mean exit time becomes finite@xcite .",
    "consider now our sfd model with @xmath201 .",
    "then , for the left particle , the right one plays the role of a moving reflection boundary .",
    "that is , the left particle diffuses within a finite interval of a fluctuating length .",
    "contrary to the case of the static boundary , the survival probability of the left particle decays as @xmath202 , and its mean exit time is infinite .",
    "it is interesting that the case @xmath203 brings us to still another behavior of the leftmost particle . for this particle ,",
    "the central particle again represents a moving boundary .",
    "this boundary itself diffuses and , moreover , it feels another moving boundary to the right of it . as a result of such right - hand confinement",
    "the escape process of the leftmost particle is accelerated , its mean exit time is finite , but the variance of the exit time still diverges . for a general @xmath1 , the exit time of any @xmath79-th tagged particle with @xmath204 possesses both a finite mean value and a finite variance .    in leaving the subject , notice that the limit @xmath9 alters only the prefactor @xmath162 but not the long - time decay exponent of @xmath171 .",
    "this limit corresponds to perfect absorption ( particle is absorbed immediately when it hits the absorbing boundary ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath205 gives the distribution of the @xmath79-th particle s _ first - passage time _ and @xmath206 equals the mean first - passage time .",
    "this paper provides a simple and general formalism for 1d sfd problems with absorbing boundaries .",
    "our main message concerns the relation of the physically motivated sfd problem and a broadly developed probabilistic field of order statistics and it can be summarized as follows .",
    "if the initial condition in the physical sfd problems is assumed in the form of a joint pdf for the order statistics based on the system of identical and independent parent random variables , then this form is preserved during the subsequent time evolution .",
    "implicitly , the observation has been already contained in the previous theoretical sfd studies in problems without boundaries .",
    "it can be easily read from the permanent - like structure of the green function .",
    "our work elaborates the connection between the sfd problem and the order - statistics point of view into new directions .",
    "first of all , we have proven that the relation continues to be valid in the problems with boundaries . in these problems ,",
    "the arbitrary - time joint pdf for the positions of the particles has again the form of the joint pdf for the order statistics , provided one simply admits that the pdf for a single parent random variable has an atom at the origin .",
    "secondly , specifically in the problems with boundaries , the joint pdf for the order statistics at an arbitrary time includes , in a mixed form , both the information on the particles remaining still in the pore and on their exit times .",
    "we have shown that these two pieces of information can be separated thereby yielding new exact results on the tagged particle diffusion and on the escape process , respectively .",
    "the robustness of the relation is easily understood as it lies in both cases ( with and without the boundaries ) in the hard - core inter - particle interaction .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that our results are independent on a detailed form of the single - particle dynamics .",
    "they hold true , for example , if the single particle is acted upon by a general space - dependent or even a space - and - time - dependent external force .",
    "the overall structure of our solution remains unchanged if we only change the details of the escape process and switch , for example , from the radiating boundary to the totally absorbing one .",
    "physically motivated calculations in these directions are in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "eventually , let us comment on our choice of the initial condition as given by eq .",
    "( [ inigeneral ] ) . obviously , it is _ not _ the most general option .",
    "for example , what happens if the particles are initially placed at specific set of coordinates @xmath207 ?",
    "taking a general initial condition , the partial pdf as defined by eq .",
    "( [ pnxt ] ) _ does not _ reduce to the simple product form ( [ pnxtproduct ] ) .",
    "instead , it assumes a rather involved permanent - like form similar to the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ perminitial ] ) . with the necessary changes",
    ", one can carry out all the steps which give the partial pdfs @xmath208 , the tagged particle pdf @xmath173 , and the survival probabilities @xmath171 .",
    "but again , all the final expressions contain permanents . in spite of these more complicated finite - time expressions ,",
    "the long - time dynamical exponents coincide with those derived in the preceding sections .",
    "again , the parameters which specify the initial condition ( together with @xmath4 and @xmath7 ) appear in the prefactors of the power laws ( [ snasymptotics ] ) , ( [ exitpdf ] ) .",
