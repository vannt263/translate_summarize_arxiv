    "the pions @xmath15 are the goldstone bosons of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd : @xmath16 .",
    "their low - energy dynamics can therefore be calculated systematically ( and accurately ) with chiral perturbation theory in form of a loop - expansion based on an effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "the accurate two - loop prediction @xcite for the isospin - zero s - wave @xmath17-scattering length @xmath18 has been confirmed in the e865 @xcite and na48/2 @xcite experiments by analyzing the @xmath19 invariant mass distribution of the rare kaon decay mode @xmath20 .",
    "one particular implication of that good agreement between theory and experiment is that the quark condensate @xmath21 constitutes the dominant order parameter @xcite of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( considering the two - flavor sector of qcd ) .",
    "likewise , the dirac experiment @xcite has been proposed to determine the difference of the isospin - zero and isospin - two s - wave @xmath17-scattering lengths @xmath22 by measuring the life time ( @xmath23fs ) of pionium ( i.e. @xmath19 bound electromagnetically and decaying into @xmath24 ) . in the meantime",
    "the na48/2 experiment @xcite has accumulated very high statistics for the charged kaon decay modes @xmath25 , which allowed to extract the value @xmath26 for the @xmath17-scattering length difference from the cusp effect in the @xmath24 mass spectrum at the @xmath19 threshold .",
    "this experimental result is again in very good agreement with the two - loop prediction @xmath27 of chiral perturbation theory @xcite . for a discussion of isospin breaking corrections which have to be included in a meaningful comparison between theory and experiment ,",
    "see ref.@xcite . clearly , these remarkable confirmations give confidence that chiral perturbation theory is the correct framework to calculate reliably and accurately the strong interaction dynamics of the pions at low energies .",
    "electromagnetic processes offer further possibilities to probe the internal structure of the pion .",
    "for example , pion compton scattering @xmath28 at low energies allows one to extract the electric and magnetic polarizabilities ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) of the charged pion .",
    "chiral perturbation theory at two - loop order gives for the dominant pion polarizability difference the firm prediction @xmath31@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "it is however in conflict with the existing experimental results from serpukhov @xmath33@xmath32 @xcite and mami @xmath34@xmath32 @xcite which amount to values more than twice as large .",
    "certainly , these existing experimental determinations of @xmath35 raise doubts about their correctness since they violate the chiral low - energy theorem notably by a factor 2 . the chiral low - energy theorem @xcite relates @xmath36 to the axial - vector - to - vector form factor ratio @xmath37 measured in the pibeta experiment @xcite via the radiative pion decay @xmath38 .",
    "the two - loop calculations of refs.@xcite assure that the @xmath39 corrections to it are in fact small",
    ".    in that contradictory situation , it is promising that the ongoing compass experiment @xcite at cern aims at remeasuring the pion polarizabilities , @xmath29 and @xmath40 , with high statistics using the primakoff effect .",
    "the scattering of high - energy negative pions in the coulomb field of a heavy nucleus ( of charge @xmath41 ) gives access to cross sections for @xmath14 reactions through the equivalent photon method : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 denotes the momentum transferred by the virtual photon to the heavy nucleus of charge @xmath41 , and one aims at isolating the coulomb peak @xmath44 from the strong interaction background .",
    "the last factor @xmath45 is the total cross section for a @xmath14 reaction induced by real photons with @xmath46 the corresponding @xmath14 center - of - mass energy .",
    "note that eq.(1 ) applies in the same form to differential cross sections on both sides .",
    "the compass experiment is set up to detect simultaneously various ( multi - particle ) hadronic final states which are produced in the primakoff scattering process of high - energy pions .",
    "in addition to pion compton scattering @xmath47 ( which is of primary interest for determining the pion polarizabilities @xmath29 and @xmath40 ) the reaction @xmath48 serves as a test of the qcd chiral anomaly ( i.e. the anomalous @xmath49 rectangle quark diagram ) by measuring the @xmath50 coupling constant @xmath51gev@xmath52 . for the two - body process @xmath48 the one - loop @xcite and two - loop corrections @xcite of chiral perturbation theory as well as qed radiative corrections @xcite have been worked out .",
    "thus an accurate theoretical framework is available to analyze the upcoming data .",
    "the @xmath53 reaction with three charged pions in the final state is used by the compass collaboration in the energy range 1gev@xmath542.5gev to study the spectroscopy of non - strange meson resonances @xcite ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 etc . ) and to search for so - called exotic meson resonances @xcite ( e.g. @xmath60 ) with quantum numbers different from simple ( constituent ) quark - antiquark bound states .",
    "the statistics of the compass experiment is actually so high that the event rates with three pions in the final state can even be continued downward to the threshold .",
    "the cross sections ( and other more exclusive observables ) of the @xmath61 reactions in the low - energy region @xmath62gev offer new possibilities to test the strong interaction dynamics of the pions as predicted by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the total cross sections for the processes @xmath63 and @xmath64 at tree - level have been calculated recently in ref.@xcite and it was found that the cross section for the charged channel ( @xmath65 ) comes out about a factor of 2.5 larger than the one for the neutral channel ( @xmath66 ) . in both cases",
    "it is the chiral pion - pion interaction ( together with the electromagnetic pion - photon coupling ) which governs these reactions at leading order .",
    "a preliminary analysis @xcite of the compass data for @xmath64 in the low - energy range @xmath67gev leads to a total cross section which seems to be in agreement with the tree - level result @xcite of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "an arguable aspect of that analysis is the absolute normalization which has to known well in order to convert count rates of events into a cross section .",
    "however , before any conclusions about an agreement between theory and experiment can be drawn the predictions of chiral perturbation theory need to be sharpened further by including higher orders in the small momentum expansion .",
    "this is precisely the purpose of the present paper .",
    "we evaluate for the double - pion photoproduction processes @xmath63 and @xmath64 the next - to - leading order corrections as they arise from pion - loop diagrams and chiral - invariant counterterms ( proportional to the low - energy constants @xmath68 ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we treat first the somewhat simpler case of neutral pion - pair production .",
    "we give for individual diagrams the analytical expressions for the pertinent production amplitudes , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which depend on five independent lorentz - invariant kinematical variables . in this detailed exposition one",
    "can check the exact cancellation of ultraviolet divergences between pion - loops and counterterms .",
    "combined with the tree - level amplitudes , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are employed to calculate the total cross section and the two - pion mass spectra for @xmath63 .",
    "we find that the total cross sections ( as well as the two - pion mass spectra ) get enhanced by a factor @xmath8 after including the next - to - leading order chiral corrections .",
    "although the dynamics of the whole process is much richer this enhancement can be understood ( in an approximate way ) from the @xmath69 final state interaction . in section 3 , the same analytical calculation",
    "is performed for charged pion - pair production @xmath70 . in that case",
    "many more diagrams do contribute since the photon can now couple to all three outgoing ( charged ) pions .",
    "for that reason we restrict ourselves to specifying the finite parts of the pion - loop diagrams and the total counterterm contribution ( rewritten in terms of the low - energy constants @xmath71 which subsume the chiral logarithm @xmath72 generated by pion - loops ) .",
    "interestingly , we find that the total cross section for @xmath73 in the low - energy region @xmath74 remains almost unchanged by the inclusion of the next - to - leading order corrections .",
    "although the dynamics of the process is much richer the ( known ) weak influence of chiral corrections on the isospin - two @xmath75 scattering length @xmath76 @xcite can provide an explanation for this feature . in this case",
    "the @xmath19 mass spectrum reveals better certain dynamical details which get averaged out in the total cross section .",
    "we estimate also the uncertainties of the observables for the @xmath77 reactions which are induced by the present errorbars of the low - energy constants @xmath78 , and find about @xmath79 .    in summary",
    ", we have calculated the processes @xmath80 and @xmath64 at next - to - leading order in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the predictions for the total cross sections and other more exclusive observables can be tested soon by the compass experiment at cern .",
    "in this section we treat the neutral pion - pair production process : @xmath81 .",
    "we choose for the ( transversal ) real photon the coulomb - gauge in the center - of - mass frame , which entails the conditions @xmath82 .",
    "these conditions imply that all diagrams for which the photon couples to the in - coming pion @xmath83 vanish identically .",
    "furthermore , it is advantageous to parametrize the special - unitary matrix - field @xmath84 in the chiral lagrangian @xmath85 through an interpolating pion - field @xmath86 in the form @xmath87 .",
    "it has the consequence that no @xmath88 and @xmath89 contact vertices exist at leading order . under these assumptions one",
    "is left with one single non - vanishing tree diagram shown in fig.1 .",
    "let us recall the expression for the total cross section for @xmath90 at tree - level : @xmath91 here , @xmath92 denotes the squared center - of - mass energy , @xmath93 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath94mev stands for the pion decay constant . in comparison to eq.(16 ) in ref.@xcite we have included ( some ) isospin breaking effects by distinguishing the mass of the charged pion @xmath95mev from the mass of the neutral pion @xmath96mev . since it turns out that these effects are very small ( see fig.7 ) we will perform the whole calculation in the limit of isospin symmetry . in order to present the next - to - leading order corrections from chiral loops and counterterms one has to start from the general form of the t - matrix , which reads ( in coulomb - gauge ) : @xmath97 \\,.\\ ] ] in this decomposition @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two dimensionless production amplitudes which depend on @xmath92 and on four other independent ( lorentz - invariant ) mandelstam variables : @xmath98 this set is very convenient for describing the permutation of the two identical neutral pions in the final state via @xmath99 . for most diagrammatic contributions @xmath100 , but there are a few exceptions which require their separate listing and specification .     and @xmath101 .",

    "the four pairs of ( full and dashed ) curves correspond to sections at center - of - mass - energies @xmath276 in ascending order .",
    "in essence fig.13 reproduces the features of the total cross section , namely a slight enhancement above @xmath277 by the next - to - leading order chiral corrections .",
    "the @xmath19 mass spectrum @xmath278 shown in fig.14 indicates some more interesting structures .",
    "the dip of the @xmath19 mass spectrum at intermediate @xmath19 invariant masses @xmath219 becomes much more pronounced when including the next - to - leading order chiral corrections .",
    "this distinctive feature holds e.g. at the center - of - mass energy @xmath279 where the total cross sections in tree and one - loop approximation are equal .",
    "the @xmath19 mass spectrum of the reaction @xmath261 therefore seems to provide an interesting indicator for the role of chiral ( pion - loop ) dynamics beyond leading order .",
    "it is expected that the upcoming high - statistics data of the compass experiment at cern can reveal such dynamical details .",
    "of course , the squared ( transversal ) t - matrix @xmath280 with its full dependence on pion energies and angles incorporates still much more dynamical information .",
    "in passing we note that @xmath282 is presumably the maximal center - of - mass energy up to which a one - loop calculation of the processes @xmath61 in chiral perturbation theory can be trusted . at still higher energies the contributions from meson resonances ( such as @xmath55 , @xmath56 etc . ) will start to play a prominent role . in the context of such considerations",
    "it should be kept in mind that the effects of the resonance tails at low - energies are encoded in the empirical values of low - energy constants @xmath283 .",
    "the role of the low - lying @xmath284 resonance occurring in the isospin - one @xmath285-subsystem needs to be investigated by studying an appropriate resonance model for @xmath61 .",
    "respecting fully gauge - invariance in the construction of such a resonance model ( with inclusion of finite resonance widths ) represents some challenge .",
