    "x - ray bursts observed in accreting neutron stars ( ns ) in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) come in two types , sometimes similar in appearance ( @xmath0 min time scales , @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 peak luminosities ) but thought to be due to very different mechanisms , because of the large difference ( by factors @xmath3 ) in average power .",
    "type i bursts arise from the heating and cooling of the ns photosphere after a thermonuclear shell flash of accreted material ( see reviews by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with thermal spectra of varying temperature and roughly constant emitting area . despite some remaining open questions ( e.g. , , , )",
    "a general understanding of the physics underlying type i bursts has been reached , also thanks to the wide range of circumstances in which they occur ( type of lmxb , accretion rates , etc ) provided in particular by the relatively large amount of bursters ( over a hundred ) .",
    "type ii bursts remain largely a puzzle .",
    "soon after their discovery , @xcite showed that their short recurrence times rule out the possibility that they are powered by nuclear burning , ascribing the source instead to gravitational potential energy .",
    "little more is understood about their origin , also because they are only confidently detected in two sources : the rapid burster ( mxb 1730335 , hereafter rb ) , a recurring transient which is the object of the present study and which also exhibits type i bursts , and the bursting pulsar ( bp ) , a slowly rotating ( 2  hz ) accretion - powered pulsar @xcite .",
    "one of the first properties of type ii bursts discovered in the rb is the relaxation - oscillator behaviour : the fluence in a type ii burst is proportional to the waiting time to the next burst @xcite .",
    "this is not observed in the bp @xcite .",
    "the relaxation - oscillator behaviour seems to point to the presence of a mass storage from which matter can be released and then replenished at a constant rate , so that the amount of depleted material determines the time to refill the buffer @xcite .",
    "the accretion disc is the most obvious candidate for this buffer and all proposed models involve one ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the various time scales at different positions in the disc can help to explain the range of observed type ii burst time scales , while a key role in acting as a gating mechanism might be played by a magnetic field ( e.g. , recent simulations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    notwithstanding that models involving some role for the ns magnetic field seem promising ,",
    "the strength of the magnetic field is unfortunately not known in the rb due to the lack of pulsations . for the bp , estimates of the surface strength of the dipolar component of the magnetic field @xmath4 put it in the range @xmath5  g @xcite .",
    "while this is larger than in typical ns lmxbs @xcite , it is not unique among bursters ( estimates put the magnetic field of the ns in igr j17480 - 2446 at @xmath6  g ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , at least another parameter besides the magnetic field strength ( e.g. , the stellar spin , or the inclination of @xmath4 with respect to the stellar spin axis ) must determine the type ii burst occurrence .",
    "* hereafter b13 ) have shown that thermonuclear ( type i ) x - ray bursts in the rb occur over an unusually large range of accretion luminosities , from about 45 per cent of the eddington luminosity @xmath7 ( assuming it is located in the globular cluster liller 1 at a distance of @xmath8  kpc , @xcite ) down to almost quiescence . however , while the type i bursts span the entire range of luminosities , type ii bursts only appear below a critical luminosity of about 10 per cent @xmath7 ( * ? ?",
    "hence , there are a type - i - only phase and a mixed phase .",
    "the type - i - only state is a soft state because the persistent emission spectrum is dominated by a disc black - body component , and it spans the range 1045 per cent of @xmath7 .",
    "this is almost unique among type i burst sources : all other bursters show nearly no type i bursts above @xmath9 , except for the slow ( 11  hz ) pulsar igr j174802446 @xcite .",
    "the abundance of type i bursts in the rb above this threshold prompted b13 to propose that it is a slow rotator too , and to speculate that this might actually be one of the necessary ingredients for producing type ii bursts .",
    "as the rb exits the soft state , the first type ii bursts appear .",
    "these first type ii bursts are the most energetic , long and infrequent .",
    "a brief ( typically a few days ) intermediate state exists in which these are accompanied by double - peaked type i bursts and a qpo at 0.25  hz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b14 ) .",
    "the unusual shape of the type i bursts found in this short - lived intermediate outburst phase seems to be due to a temporary obscuration of the ns surface during the burst decay , producing the double peaks .",
    "the ensuing type ii bursts , the obscuration phenomenon and the occurrence of a qpo are probably related to the change in the accretion geometry that is widely thought to take place between the soft and the hard state .",
    "having studied the soft and intermediate states in our aforementioned papers , we now complete our study of the entire _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ , 19952012 ) rb database by focussing on the type - ii - burst dominated hard state , so called because of the power - law component that dominates the persistent emission spectrum .",
    "we aim at constructing a population study of type ii bursts to compare it with the predictions of the few available theoretical models , and as a future reference . in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs ] we introduce the dataset , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : ana ] we illustrate our methodology . in sec .",

    "+      this study is about measurements with the proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard _ rxte_. it consists of five co - aligned proportional counter units ( pcus ) that combine to a total photon collecting area of 8000  @xmath10 over a 2 to 60  kev bandpass @xcite .",
    "nearly all _ rxte _ observations of the rb ( exposure time 2.4  ms ) were carried out in one of three configurations . for 553  ks",
    ", the pca was directly pointed at the source .",
    "these observations are contaminated by the presence of the persistently bright 4u 1728 - 34 at an angular distance of 0.56@xmath11 . for 612  ks ,",
    "the pointing was offset by just this amount , thus avoiding the contamination at the expense of roughly half the effective area . finally , for 1.3  ms the pca was pointed at 4u 1728 - 34 , serendipitously encompassing the rb .",
    "we have investigated all of the 2.4  ms of data .    we extracted a lightcurve from the standard-1 data for all the observations containing the rb in the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "these data have 0.125  s time resolution and no photon energy resolution .",
    "the telescope orientation was determined with the ftool pcaclrsp , and deemed stable if the jitter was below 20  arcsec .",
    "we performed a visual inspection of all the light curves .",
    "for the details of source ( rb vs 4u 1728 - 34 ) and burst ( type i vs type ii ) identification , we refer the reader to appendix  [ sec : appendix_search ] . in total",
    ", we identified 123 type i and 8458 type ii bursts from the rb .",
    "as already mentioned , type ii bursts are only emitted by the rb at persistent luminosities below 10 per cent of the eddington limit ( b13 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when the rb is in the hard state ( b14 ) .",
    "actually the rb almost never reaches higher luminosities during outbursts after 1999 (; b14 ) .",
    "three modes of type ii bursting behaviour follow one another in a smooth transition , differing in lightcurves , energetics and bursting patterns @xcite . to illustrate the evolution of the type ii burst behaviour , we plot the light curve from _ rxte _ data of the outburst in june - july 2006 ( fig .  [ fig : outburst92026 ] ) .",
    "the first type ii bursts are hundreds of seconds long , often with flat peaks , and have the longest recurrence times ( sometimes longer than a few ks observation ) .",
    "the persistent emission drops right before and after them .",
    "these are the so - called mode-0 type ii bursts ( fig .  [ fig : outburst92026 ] , top - left inset ) .",
    "we identified a record long mode 0 burst with a duration of at least 1100  s. it is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : outburst92026 ] as the long plateau on june 26 .    at lower persistent fluxes ,",
    "the large bursts are increasingly preceded by sequences of 8 to 40 short bursts .",
    "after the final longer burst , a longer gap is measured , during which the persistent emission rises to a level higher than that of the intra - burst emission , in a `` hump '' shape . this bursting pattern is called mode 1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : outburst92026 ] , top - right inset ) .",
    "as the outburst decays further , the sequences of mode 1 type ii bursts become increasingly long , the final bursts less energetic , and the humps shorter and less pronounced .",
    "eventually all bursts have similar energetics and durations : this is the so - called mode 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : outburst92026 ] , bottom - middle inset ) .",
    "finally , even these bursts become increasingly sparse , as the source moves to quiescence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : outburst92026 ] , bottom - right inset ) .",
    "we caution that the sequence `` no type ii bursts @xmath12 mode 0 @xmath12 mode 1 @xmath12 mode 2 '' is only a _",
    "general _ trend .",
    "for instance , the flat peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : outburst92026 ] starting on june 27 is not a very long mode 0 type ii burst , but an actual switch of the source to the soft state , during which a type i burst can be seen , but no type ii bursts .",
    "two observations were taken the day before and the day after showing long mode 0 type ii bursts , meaning that the soft state lasted briefly .",
    "also , the rb can sometimes be seen switching back and forth between modes .",
    "the switch is sudden rather than gradual ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_switching ] , already noted by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the rb can be seen to transit back and forth between modes for a few ks .",
    "it is clear from the picture that the minima before and after a mode 0 burst are not `` dips '' : rather , the humps in between are what is peculiar and are a feature common to all very energetic type ii bursts , independent of bursting mode .",
    "the sampling along an outburst is often patchy , meaning that it is not easy to establish an average duration for each mode .",
    "the outburst in fig .",
    "[ fig : outburst92026 ] is probably the best sampled one .",
    "it features the longest mode 0 phase in the entire dataset , lasting @xmath13 days , albeit including a brief return into the soft state . the longest uninterrupted mode 0 bursting phase occurred in an earlier outburst , and lasted @xmath14 days .",
    "mode 1 bursts are visible in fig .  [ fig : outburst92026 ] for @xmath15 days . in a later outburst ,",
    "they were observed to last for twice that time , @xmath16 days .",
    "finally , mode 2 burst were continuously observed for up to 24 days , the longest stretch in the dataset .",
    "our search routine found 8458 type ii bursts in the entire dataset ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table : bursts ] .",
    "we determined the instrumental and cosmic diffuse background with the ftool pcabackest .",
    "no bursts were analyzed that are outside so - called good time intervals ( gti ) , are affected by data gaps are overlapping with type i bursts ( from either the rb or 4u 1728 - 34 ) , or are in obsids for which the collimator response was not constant because of a slew .",
    "this left us with 7601 bursts .",
    "of these , 3662 type ii bursts are present in 389  ks of direct pointings , while 3183 were observed during 341  ks of offset pointings , and 756 during 92  ks of 4u 1728 - 34 observations .",
    "the time resolution of the spectral analysis varied across the different observations and within observations is chosen to follow the variability in flux . in total 374 spectra",
    "were extracted from these 11 observations , involving 8 mode-0 bursts ( including the longest one detected ) , 25 mode-1 bursts and 23 mode-2 bursts .",
    "the spectral analysis involves the following generalities .",
    "spectra were extracted from event - mode data with 64 spectral channels .",
    "all active pcus were employed .",
    "the bandpass was limited to 2.5 - 20 kev which is where the pca is well calibrated @xcite and contains most of the signal .",
    "a systematic error of 0.5 per cent per channel was included ( following * ? ? ?",
    "all spectra were corrected for particle background and cosmic diffuse background as predicted through the pcabackest tool ( version 3.8 ) .",
    "the pca response matrix was calculated with version 11.7.1 of tool pcarsp .",
    "this includes a correction for the collimator response which is always non - standard because the rb is always considerably off - axis in the selected obsids .",
    "the collimator throughput for the rb was usually about 0.4 .",
    "spectral bins were combined to obtain at least 20 counts per bin to ensure applicability of the @xmath18 statistic .",
    "all spectral modelling was carried out with xspec version 12.8.2 .",
    "a constant cold interstellar absorption component was assumed to apply , equivalent to @xmath19  @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the absorption model of @xcite was followed .",
    "a significant contribution may be expected from the galactic ridge . to determine this , off - axis observation i d 92026 - 01 - 04 - 00",
    "was chosen which represents the observation with the lowest flux measured for the rb field .",
    "it was taken on june 9 , 2006 , 11 days before the onset of the outburst presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the background - subtracted data was modelled with the combination of a raymond - smith component @xcite and a power law , following the prescription of @xcite as also determined from pca ridge data .",
    "the fit was satisfactory with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this constant spectral component was assumed to be present in all studied rb spectra .",
    "we tested various models on the data : single component models ( power law , planck function , thermal bremsstrahlung , comptonization ) and models with combinations of two components .",
    "it was found that models with three free parameters were sufficient to describe all spectra .",
    "we chose the comptonization model according to @xcite as baseline since this is the simplest model fitting all data .",
    "furthermore , we find that this model performs best to the highest quality spectrum ( 20093 - 01 - 07 - 01r whose spectrum contains 10@xmath23 counts ) , with @xmath24 for @xmath22 . as an example , for the same data @xmath25 for a model consisting of a disk black body and a power law , and 6.88 for a cut - off power law .",
    "we note that it was necessary to complement the continuum model with a narrow line at about 6.5 kev , in the spectral region where the fe - k resonance line resides ( 6.4 - 6.9 kev , depending on the ionization state of fe ) .",
    "possibly it is related to instrumentally scattered emission from the bright source 4u 1728 - 34 just outside the field of view , or to an inadequate modelling of the galactic ridge at this location .",
    "figure  [ spec_examplek ] shows an example of a time history for observation 92026 - 01 - 06 - 00 which shows a sequence of 5 bright and relatively short mode-0 bursts .",
    "what is clearly visible here , and that applies in general to all our spectral results , is that plasma temperature and optical depth show no significant variability , while photon seed temperature does .",
    "the plasma temperature varies in general between 2.5 and 3.5 kev while at the same time the plasma optical depth varies between 7 and 4 , both typical 1-sigma errors of 1 in value .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the spectral data is subject for a future paper .",
    "we here confine the analysis to inferring an average translation factor between photon fluxes and fluences and energy fluxes and fluences .    for the most accurately determined 112 spectral shapes , we find that a photon flux of 1  c  s@xmath2pcu@xmath2 for the whole bandpass translates on average to a 2.5 - 20 kev energy flux of @xmath26  erg  @xmath20s@xmath2 .",
    "all 112 conversion values are contained within 7% from this average .",
    "thus , the maximum systematic error by assuming a constant conversion factor is 7% . converting from 2.5 - 20 kev energy flux to unabsorbed bolometric flux involves a factor of @xmath27 .",
    "all 112 bolometric correction factors range between -7% and + 2% from the mean .",
    "therefore , the maximum systematic error in the bolometric correction factor is 7% .    in fig .",
    "[ spec_spectra ] we show spectra of the five most diverse states of the rb . the conversion factor from c  s@xmath2pcu@xmath2 to unabsorbed bolometric erg  @xmath20s@xmath2  varies between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "spectra for five widely different states of rb . from bottom to top : non - burst emission between slow mode-2 bursts ( black curve , obsid 30424 - 01 - 06 - 01r ) , non - burst emission in long intermission between mode-1 bursts ( light blue , 30424 - 01 - 02 - 02r ) , peak of longest mode-0 burst ever measured ( green ; 92026 - 01 - 06 - 03 ) , soft state prior to mode-0 ( red ; 20418 - 01 - 01 - 01r ) , peak of bright short mode-0 burst ( dark blue ; 30424 - 01 - 01 - 02r ) .",
