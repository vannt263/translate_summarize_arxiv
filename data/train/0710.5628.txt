    "stars with an initial mass between @xmath0 and @xmath1 m@xmath2 become hydrogen / helium - shell - burning asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars or core - helium - burning red supergiants ( rsg ) .",
    "these phases are characterised by cool , molecular atmospheres giving rise to m spectral types ( s or c for some chemically peculiar agb stars ) , strong radial pulsations of this atmosphere on timescales of a year or more , and a high luminosity ( @xmath3 l@xmath2 ) .",
    "the pulsation may lift the atmosphere high enough such that dust can condense @xcite .",
    "radiation pressure on the grains then drives a dust wind which , via collisions with molecular hydrogen , drags the gas along with it . at a typical wind speed @xmath4 to 30 km s@xmath5",
    "these stars lose mass at rates from @xmath6 to over @xmath7 m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 @xcite . in agb stars",
    "this leads to the removal of the mantle and the premature death of the star , leaving the truncated core behind as a cooling white dwarf .",
    "the more massive rsgs either explode or evolve back to higher surface temperatures , and it is not yet clear how much mass they will have shed during the preceding rsg stage .",
    "mass - loss rates of cool , luminous stars are most easily estimated from the reprocessed radiation emitted by the dust grains at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths , which is particularly conspicuous in the @xmath8 to 40 @xmath9 m region .",
    "the main problem with this method is that the dust constitutes only a minor fraction of the total mass in the wind , typically @xmath0:@xmath10 @xcite but poorly known for all but the dustiest stars .",
    "carbon monoxide has strong rotational transitions at mm wavelengths which can be detected in relatively nearby stars , but despite being the most abundant molecule after h@xmath11 this too is a trace species of which the mass fraction is uncertain  and modelling the co line requires knowledge of the temperature profile throughout the envelope which depends , amongst other things , on the dust content .",
    "low - mass stars ( @xmath12 m@xmath2 ) evolve along a first ascent red giant branch ( rgb ) as hydrogen - shell burning stars with an inert helium core .",
    "they reach a maximum luminosity of only @xmath13 l@xmath2 , and it becomes problematic for them to drive a wind .",
    "the situation is worsened by the fact that many rgb stars do not pulsate strongly and slowly enough to sufficiently increase the scaleheight , and the dust condensation is therefore unlikely to reach completeness . with a low , uncertain dust :",
    "gas mass ratio and possibly higher dilution of the dust envelope as it kinematically decouples from the bulk gas , measured mass - loss rates will tend to be too low .",
    "the threshold below which this happens is not well known , partly because of uncertainties in the opacity of the grains as they nucleate and grow : @xcite estimate @xmath14 m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 but @xcite place it at @xmath15 m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite show that rgb mass loss must be driven by another mechanism , but that this appears to be similarly efficient as a dust - driven wind .",
    "the warmer stars further down the rgb have more prominent chromospheres , which may be accompanied by the generation of alfvn or acoustic waves that provide a possible alternative mechanism for driving a wind .",
    "mass - loss rates estimated from the ir emission for the brightest , dustiest rgb stars are typically @xmath6 to @xmath16 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "mass - loss rates from @xmath17 to @xmath16 m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 have been determined from the blue - displaced cores of strong optical absorption lines and emission in some of these lines , but these are very uncertain too because of the sensitivity to the precise excitation and ionization conditions in the wind . for the most luminous rgb stars the ir and optical estimates tend to agree within an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "rsophiuchi has a spectral type of m2 @xcite , and i will later show that the luminosity is @xmath18 l@xmath2 .",
    "this places it on an isochrone of a star with an initial mass of @xmath19 m@xmath2 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "although it is a few times fainter than the tip - rgb luminosity and not as cool as it gets , mass loss is expected at a level of @xmath20 m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 and may be accompanied by dust .",
    "rsoph is usually classified as an s - type system , which by definition is a system devoid of dust as the dusty systems are classified as d - type .",
    "the latter usually contain a mira - type large - amplitude variable donor star , which is likely to be an agb star .",
    "rsoph is not a mira - type variable , and definitely on the rgb , but it does have circumstellar dust , and the s - type classification is thus misleading . its ir emission at @xmath21 @xmath9 m was detected and attributed to dust for the first time in 1970 by @xcite , which lead them to remark : `` the infrared emission from novae closely resembles that from many infrared stars in which the rate of mass loss is more constant .",
    "this suggests that the formation of grains is governed by similar processes in all these systems , and that novae are key objects in understanding how the dust is formed . ''",
    "dust had thus been detected within three years from the eruption in 1967 .",
    "rsoph underwent two more eruptions , in 1985 and in 2006 , and as far as i know the system has been observed at mid - ir wavelengths twice more during quiescence and again shortly after the 2006 eruption ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "large differences in the mid - ir emission might be expected depending on the temporal proximity of an eruption , so it came as a surprise to find the contrary .",
    "rsoph was detected in the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) survey in 1983 @xcite .",
    "it is listed in the iras point source catalogue with @xmath22 jy and @xmath23 jy ( the upper limits at 60 and 100 @xmath9 m are meaningless ) ; @xcite estimate @xmath24 jy and @xmath25 jy , and @xcite estimate @xmath26 jy and @xmath27 jy .",
    "i have re - measured the iras scans , and derive refined estimates of @xmath28 jy and @xmath29:@xmath30 jy ( fig .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath31 jy and @xmath32 jy from pointed observations carried out with iras in september 1983 ( they estimate that free - free emission may contribute @xmath33 and @xmath34 jy at @xmath35 and 25 @xmath9 m , respectively ) .",
    "the iras 12-@xmath9 m flux densities are in remarkably good agreement with the @xcite measurement of @xmath36 jy ( an n - band magnitude of @xmath37 to 5.1 mag ) a dozen years earlier .",
    "then again , there had not been any eruption meanwhile .",
    "soon after the end of the iras mission , rsoph put up a show again .",
    "curiously , it took more than a decade until new mid - ir measurements were made , in march 1996 with the phot - s instrument onboard the infrared space observatory ( iso ) .",
    "@xcite analysed the spectrum shortward of @xmath38 @xmath9 m and found no evidence for dust emission . however , at those wavelengths the dust emission is @xmath39 jy ; the uncertainties in zodiacal light correction and instrument calibration and sensitivity do not permit the detection of the dust emission in the phot - s spectrum around 8 - 11 @xmath9 m .    another decade passed before new mid - ir measurements were made , this time with the spitzer space telescope ( spitzer ) triggered by the february 2006 eruption . by september 2006",
    "the free - free and line emission had weakened enough to reveal a continuum and spectral features unambiguously identifiable with predominantly silicate - type dust @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the spitzer spectrum agrees frightfully well with all previous photometry ( fig.4 ) .",
    "i used the radiative transfer code dusty @xcite to model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the main input parameter of interest is the optical depth , @xmath40 , which is related to the mass - loss rate via the dust : gas mass ratio ( assumed to be 1:200 ) , luminosity ( @xmath41 l@xmath2 , measured from the fit to the data assuming a distance of 1.5 kpc ) and wind speed ( computed by the model for a dust - driven wind ) . the second input parameter of interest is the temperature at the inner edge of the dust envelope , t@xmath42 .",
    "the model sed also depends on the dust species used , and on the temperature of the star ( for which we adopt @xmath43 k consistent with its spectral type ) .",
    "a good fit was obtained using circumstellar silicates from @xcite , and @xmath44 k. the model overestimates the strength of the 10-@xmath9 m feature , but this also depends on the grain properties such as size , shape and composition ( a @xcite size distribution was assumed ) .",
    "i thus estimate a mass - loss rate @xmath45 m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 at a wind speed @xmath46 km s@xmath5 .",
    "although silicates can form already at temperatures above 1,000 k there is a conspicuous absence of such warm dust ( @xmath47 k ) .",
    "because the dust shell is optically thin the sed does not depend much on the geometry .",
    "assuming a spherically symmetric wind , the dust envelope starts at a distance of 39 r@xmath48 ( @xmath49 au ) from the red giant ( the outer radius is not constrained by the available data other than that it is @xmath50 r@xmath48 ) ; the orbital radius is @xmath0 au ( fig.5 ) .",
    "although the wind is unlikely to travel at a constant speed @xmath51 before dust even forms , it would take 6 years to reach the dust formation zone if it did ; the binary would have gone round nearly five times and it is thus highly unlikely that the binary motion leaves non - axisymmetric imprints on the dust shell .",
    "it has been suggested that symbiotic stars lose mass more rapidly than single stars @xcite .",
    "however , when comparing rsoph with other dusty stars i find no evidence for a particularly high mass - loss rate . in fig .",
    "6 the differences are plotted between the measured mass - loss rate and the one predicted by the formula for dust - driven winds of oxygen - rich agb stars and rsgs @xcite .",
    "rsoph sits at the warm end of the diagram , where many stars appear to have lower mass - loss rates or a lower dust content ( including the famous rsgs betelgeuse and @xmath9cep ) .",
    "yet its mass - loss rate is nearly as expected for a well - developed , efficiently dust - driven wind .",
    "although at the faint end of the distribution , rsoph is also in line with what is measured for red giants in globular clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig.13 ) .    on the other hand , stars that do not pulsate in the fundamental mode , like miras do ,",
    "have lower mass - loss rates or less complete dust formation ( fig.6 ) .",
    "compared to those cooler stars , rsoph seems to have a rather high mass - loss rate .",
    "the mass - loss rate of rsoph may even have been under - estimated , if the dust : gas ratio is lower than assumed .",
    "physical mechanisms exist that might explain enhanced mass loss in symbiotic systems , e.g. , through equatorial collimation or tides @xcite .",
    "the remarkable observation is that the system has been losing mass at a ( near ) constant rate , and that the eruptions have done little to affect the dust envelope .",
    "this can be understood if the eruptions are highly an - isotropic .",
    "recurrent novae are relatively old systems , and hence they have developed large peculiar velocities with respect to the ism .",
    "it is therefore possible that recurrent novae carve out a path through the ism as their winds sweep up ism material and/or the nova eruptions leave a trail of successive shells .",
    "a composite of iras images at 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath9 m reveals a dark patch of 1 - 2@xmath52 diameter around rsoph ( fig .  7 )",
    " the direction of the galactic plane is towards the lower - left corner . after scaling to the same mean and spread",
    ", a median combination of all 12 - 100 @xmath9 m images shows an elongated cut into the ism , with rsoph near its end and its proper motion pointing at a trajectory along it . in the same time it took rsoph to traverse along the structure ( @xmath0 myr ) ,",
    "its wind would have blown a bubble of @xmath53 diameter ( fig .",
    "this is highly suggestive of rsoph being responsible for the ism structure .",
    "an h@xmath54 map @xcite shows what looks like a bubble of ionized gas , with rsoph near its western edge ( fig .",
    "8) . @xcite noticed this structure when studying the nearby symbiotic binary xxoph ; they estimate a radial velocity of @xmath55 km s@xmath5 for the gas and exclude an association with xxoph .",
    "rsoph has @xmath56 km s@xmath5 @xcite and is therefore also not associated with the extended h@xmath54 emission . however ,",
    "combined with the dust map from @xcite the ism structure more closely resembles a hole in the dust through which background emission is seen , rather than a hot bubble ( fig .",
    "8) . composed of a be star and a late - m giant , xxoph rather than rsoph might have created the ism structure .",
    "iras images around the recurrent dwarf nova tpyxidis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) also show a cavity , with a @xmath57 diameter ( fig .",
    "a @xmath58 diameter hot shell was linked with the 1944 eruption or an earlier one by @xcite ; the larger cavity i report here could have originated more than @xmath59 yr ago , possibly built up during successive eruptions .",
    "dust in rsoph has been detected in between several eruptions , and at only half a year since the 2006 eruption .",
    "the silicate dust species and mass - loss rate of @xmath60 to @xmath61 m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 are not at odds with the expectations for well - developed dust - driven winds of single stars . but",
    "because rsoph has a relatively warm photosphere , weak pulsation and not very high luminosity , this might in fact suggest that the mass - loss rate _ is _ enhanced by the effects of the companion white dwarf .",
    "the eruptions do _ not _ seem to have a dramatic effect on the dust envelope .",
    "an accretion rate onto the white dwarf surface of @xmath15 m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 would probably require an enhanced flow through the lagrangian point l@xmath62 .",
