    "we can find @xmath48 appear periodic fluctuations with increasing @xmath28 , and the amplitude becomes smaller and smaller with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "average velocity @xmath48 as a function of the modulation constant @xmath14 is shown in fig.[fig9 ] . as the modulation constant @xmath14 increases , the average velocity first increases , and then decreases near @xmath64 .",
    "there exists an optimal value of @xmath14 at which the average velocity @xmath48 takes its maximal value .",
    "when there is no coupling between the @xmath0 direction potential and the @xmath1 direction potential(@xmath65 ) , the average velocity @xmath66 .",
    "the results differ from the results of ref.@xcite , the major reason is the independent of noise @xmath16 and @xmath17 in our study , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 have different effects on the system .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] depicts @xmath48 as a function of the self - propelled velocity @xmath5 with different @xmath23 . as @xmath62",
    ", we find @xmath66 as @xmath67 , so proper @xmath16 can induce particles transport itself whether the self - propelled velocity exists or not . as @xmath68 , it is found that the average velocity is zero until @xmath69 , the reason is the value of the @xmath0 direction force for the potential is @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , in order to pass through the channel , the particle needs a nonzero @xmath5 to move against the max force @xmath71 .",
    "this result is the same as the result of ref.@xcite .",
