    "gx 339 - 4 was discovered by @xmath7 in 1973 @xcite . the secondary star has a magnitude b @xmath8 21 @xcite . consequently the secondary has never been directly observed and its spectral type never identified .",
    "an orbital period of 14.86 hours ( 0.61916@xmath90.0027 days ) was derived by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ccht92 ) from @xmath10- and @xmath11-band photometry taken during an x - ray off state .",
    "two sets of spectra obtained in the high state by @xcite were folded on this period by ccht92 .",
    "the first data set did not show any modulation but the second set did , giving a semi - amplitude @xmath12 = 78 @xmath9 13 km s@xmath4  and systemic velocity @xmath13 = -62 @xmath9 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the mass of the compact object was estimated to be @xmath14 1 m@xmath6 based on these measurements and assuming the binary inclination @xmath15 .",
    "this estimate of @xmath16 is well below the theoretical maximum mass of a neutron star ( @xmath17 3.2 m@xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gx 339 - 4 has been classified as a black hole x - ray binary based purely on x - ray characteristics and behaviour which are very similar to another black - hole candidate cyg x-1 .",
    "if gx 339 - 4 is not black hole then this places the method of black - hole classification using x - ray data into serious question .",
    "ccht92 proposed that the optical modulation is due to eclipses of an x - ray heated companion and/or accretion disk as it was seen in both the off and high state data .",
    "this would require @xmath18 60@xmath19 which has not been supported by other optical or x - ray observations .",
    "_ the orbital period has not been confirmed by either optical spectroscopy or photometry since the ccht92 study .",
    "_ this means that the orbital period is wrong , that the orbital period is only detectable under certain physical conditions in the binary or that the data quality of subsequent studies has not been sufficient .",
    "the main aim of this study was to determine the orbital period of gx 339 - 4 from emission lines in optical spectra .",
    "this method is notoriously difficult .",
    "as the emission lines originate from the accretion disk information such as the radial velocities are more difficult to extract since their amplitudes are much smaller and they may be contaminated by other flux sources . since we have no spectral signature of the secondary star we are left with no other choice but to use disk emission lines to derive the orbital period .",
    "in this paper we present the results of analysis conducted on the emission lines in gx 339 - 4 .",
    "we discuss the spectral changes seen over the epochs and how these changes relate to the x - ray behaviour over the same period .",
    "in addition we present results of analysis aimed at detecting the orbital period from disk emission line variations .",
    "a total of 51 low dispersion and 59 high dispersion spectra were obtained between 1998 may and 1999 may .",
    "an observation log is given in table [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "observations were performed using the double - beam spectrograph ( red and blue arms ) on the australian national university 2.3 m telescope and the royal greenwich observatory spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , > , > , > , < \" , ]     in both cases the ew modulation has a maximum at phase 0.0 and minimum at phase 0.5 .",
    "this is 0.25 out of phase with respect to the h@xmath0 radial velocity curve . in other words , the h@xmath0 and heii @xmath14686 ews peak when the accretion disk is between the observer and the secondary star .",
    "@xcite observed an h@xmath0 ew modulation in gro j0422 + 32 with a broad minimum at phase 0.5 .",
    "it peaked when h@xmath0 emission line radial velocities crossed from the blue to the red side and when the secondary star velocities crossed from red to blue .",
    "garcia et al . attributed the ew changes to an asymmetrically emitting disk which may also be asymmetric geometrically .",
    "the observations were obtained during x - ray outburst and decline .    from comparison to garcia et al.s study of gro j0422 + 32",
    "we see the same behaviour in gx 339 - 4 . hence , the ew variations in gx 339 - 4 may also be due to an asymmetric accretion disk .",
    "investigation of the line profile shape over the orbit may help in determining the source of the ew variations .",
    "this is pursued in paper ii .",
    "the periodograms of the fwhm measured from single - gaussian fits to h@xmath0 , heii @xmath14686 , h@xmath2 and the bowen blend showed no significant peaks ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , the fwhm were not considered any further .",

    "there is an obvious modulation in the ratios .",
    "sinusoid curves were fitted to the v / r modulation to obtain the semi - amplitude and mean value and their errors .",
    "the errors on the binned ratios were taken from the standard deviation calculated from the least - squares sine fit .",
    "the minimum h@xmath0 v / r ratio is at orbital phase 0.25 and the maximum at phase 0.75 .",
    "this is consistent with the majority of flux variation originating from the accretion disk .",
    "the semi - amplitude is 0.11 @xmath9 0.04 and the ratios vary around a mean of 1.18 @xmath9 0.03 .",
    "v / r ratios were also measured for heii @xmath14686 and the resulting periodogram is shown in figure [ fig : vr_blue ] . although there is a single peak at the 99% confidence level it does not correspond to published orbital period but rather @xmath17 11.2 hours .",
    "the v / r ratios of heii @xmath14686 were folded on this period and is presented in figure [ fig : vr_blue ] .",
    "besides one discrepant data point at phase 0.05 , the data follow a well - defined sinusoid curve .",
    "the sold curve is the best - fit sinusoid with a semi - amplitude of 0.37 @xmath9 0.09 and mean 0.89 @xmath9 0.06 .",

    "there is no doubt that measuring the orbital period of gx 339 - 4 via disk emission lines will always be difficult .",
    "this is due to the low velocity amplitudes expected from a low - inclination @xcite .",
    "this in itself demands good quality data , that is , data with high snr and enough spectra to sample the orbital phases well .",
    "it was clear in the analysis of spectra with low ( @xmath24 40 ) snr and datasets with a low number of spectra that one could not obtain satisfactory periodograms .",
    "this is why the results presented here have focussed on the dataset of 1998 may 28 - 31 as it had the best data quality .    in the case of h@xmath0",
    "the periodograms of the radial velocities , ews and v / r ratios clearly show an isolated peak at the published orbital period at the 99% confidence level .    for heii @xmath14686 the radial velocity periodogram did not show a single peak but rather a broad double - peak around the published orbital period .",
    "when one folds the radial velocities on 14.86 hours anyway one can see a clear deviation from an otherwise sinusoid curve at phases 0.75 - 0.95 . whether this is due to some data defect or to a real physical source in the binary",
    "can not be discerned at this point but it would be interesting to see if it is present in future observations .",
    "what is clear is that the ew of heii @xmath14686 is modulated on the published orbital period and the minimum and maximum occur at the same phase as the h@xmath0 ew .",
    "since we expect h@xmath0 to originate from the outer disk regions and heii @xmath14686 further in , the source of the ew modulation must be the entire disk or at least a large part of it .",
    "we leave this point here but return to this issue in paper ii when we study further the sources of the line profile variations",
    ". the v / r ratios of heii @xmath14686 produced a periodogram with a single , isolated peak but _ not _ at the published orbital period , rather at 11.2 hours .",
    "it is not obvious why the heii @xmath14686 v / r ratios would modulate on a different period than h@xmath0 .",
    "a clue as to why this may be the case is in the asymmetry of the line profiles .",
    "h@xmath0 shows more asymmetry on the blue side than heii @xmath14686",
    ". the larger degree of asymmetry in h@xmath0 would translate into larger amplitudes of v / r ratios perhaps making it easier to discern an orbital modulation .",
    "the v / r modulation of heii @xmath14686 is fairly clear , however .    by comparing the phases of minima and maxima of the radial velocity , ew and v / r ratio modulations",
    "it seems that the variations arise from the accretion disk . in paper",
    "ii we attempt to answer whether these variations are due solely to a hotspot , to a disk which is asymmetric geometrically and/or in its emitting regions , or both .",
    "optical spectra of gx 339 - 4 was obtained when the system was in a high ( 1998 ) and low ( 1999 ) x - ray state .",
    "using interstellar absorption lines from the spectra a distance of 4 @xmath9 1 kpc was determined .",
    "@xmath25 was measured to be 1.1 @xmath9 0.2 .",
    "these are consistent with previous studies .",
    "optical colours reddened from 1998 to 1999 .",
    "this is consistent with the accretion disk contributing less blue flux to the system due to the decrease in soft x - rays available to be reprocessed in the disk .",
    "as the soft x - rays decreased in the low state the ew of h@xmath0 , h@xmath2 and heii @xmath14686 also decreased . without simultaneous photometry",
    "it is impossible to say whether this is mainly due to the continuum or line flux variations although the line flux must be declining faster than the continuum during the low state .",
    "the fwhm of the h@xmath0 , h@xmath2 , heii @xmath14686 and the bowen blend emission lines increased from 1998 to 1999 .",
    "this suggests that the line emitting regions moved closer to the compact object in 1999 .",
    "the inner regions of the accretion disk may have started to cool sufficiently for balmer emission to occur there in the low state .",
    "the higher ionisation lines of heii @xmath14686 and the bowen blend may only obtain sufficient photoionising x - rays closer to the compact object .    the h@xmath2 emission line exhibited redshifted absorption at @xmath264880  during both the high and low x - ray states .",
    "the origin of this absorption feature is not known .",
    "emission line profiles vary on the timescales of hours .",
    "analysis of the 1998 may high resolution data show that the radial velocities , ews and v / r ratios of h@xmath0 modulated on the published orbital period .",
    "_ this is the first time that the published orbital period has been confirmed by spectroscopic data since the study of ccht92 . _ the ew of heii @xmath14686 also varied on the orbital period but the radial velocities and v / r ratios were inconclusive .",
    "the radial velocities of the bowen blend modulated on the orbital period but peaked 0.25 out of phase with respect to h@xmath0",
    ". this result may not be reliable due to other significant peaks in the periodogram .",
    "the amplitude of the radial velocity modulation for h@xmath0 was 14 @xmath9 3 km s@xmath4 which is much less than that found by @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , decreases the mass function . taking @xmath27 = 14.86 hours ,",
    "@xmath28 = 0.7 m@xmath6 and @xmath15 we find that @xmath29 m@xmath6 . if @xmath30 @xcite then @xmath31 m@xmath6 which places the compact object in gx 339 - 4 into the black - hole category . determining the semi - amplitude velocity from emission lines may not be an accurate measurement of @xmath3 as has been well established from cv studies @xcite . in order to establish",
    "whether our measurement of @xmath3 is reasonable future optical spectroscopic studies of gx 339 - 4 should endeavour to measure the semi - amplitude velocities of the emission lines using data of high resolution and snr .",
    "the semi - amplitude velocities of the same species ( e.g. balmer series ) should be measured to see if they agree .",
    "if not then we need to investigate the physical processes which cause such a disagreement which may lead to better methods of measuring an accurate @xmath3 from emission lines . until such time , the black - hole categorisation of gx 339 - 4 needs to be taken with caution .",
    "we may estimate the roche lobe size ( @xmath32 ) of the secondary star for @xmath27 = 14.86 hours .",
    "first , let us assume that the secondary is a k dwarf with mass @xmath28 = 0.7 m@xmath6 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the secondary stars in other low - mass x - ray binaries with similar periods are of this spectral type ( e.g. a0620 - 00 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if @xmath16 = 5 m@xmath6 then @xmath32 = 1.3 r@xmath6 .",
    "if the secondary star in gx 339 - 4 is a k dwarf then it must be slightly evolved to fill its roche lobe . if @xmath16 = 1.4 m@xmath6 then @xmath32 = 1.7 r@xmath6 . again ,",
    "if the secondary is a k dwarf , it must be somewhat evolved .",
    "future optical spectroscopic observations of gx 339 - 4 should endeavor to obtain simultaneous optical photometry to ascertain the cause of the ew modulation .",
    "the absorption trough observed near h@xmath2 should be investigated further and it should be resolved whether h@xmath0 does or does not exhibit such a feature .",
    "most importantly , we must obtain as many spectra as possible with high snr and good temporal coverage during various x - ray phases and at as many epochs as possible .",
    "this would also enable us to ascertain whether the orbital modulation is observable only if certain physical conditions exist in the binary , for example , soft x - ray irradiation of a vertically extended hotspot .",
    "gx 339 - 4 is a difficult object to decipher due to the lack of information about the optical star and the complex behaviour of data .",
    "we should , however , continue in our efforts to study gx 339 - 4 .",
    "this object transitions into all x - ray states more often than most and , therefore , provides many opportunities to learn about the outburst mechanisms and the structure of accretion disks .",
    "the authors would like to thank prof .",
