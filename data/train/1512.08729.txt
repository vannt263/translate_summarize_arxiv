    "electric dipole moments ( edms ) are sensitive low - energy probes for new physics , i.e. , physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles @xcite .",
    "the existence of an edm gives rise to @xmath10- ( spatial parity ) and @xmath11- ( time - reversal ) odd interactions @xcite which originate in fundamental sources of ( @xmath12)-violation @xcite and are related to these via the @xmath13-theorem @xcite .",
    "atomic and molecular systems allow for probing ( @xmath12)-violation both in the lepton as well as the hadron sector of matter . in the former case ,",
    "typically the electron edm and the electron - nucleon scalar - pseudoscalar ( en - sps ) interaction are investigated @xcite .",
    "these two effects are in general the dominant expected manifestations of @xmath1-violation in paramagnetic systems @xcite . concerning the latter , possible important sources of symmetry - violating effects at the atomic scale are the nuclear schiff moment @xcite and the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment ( mqm ) @xcite , for the same underlying sources of ( @xmath12)-violation .",
    "the edm due to a nuclear - mqm - electronic - magnetic - field interaction can for certain types of atomic and molecular systems even be larger than that due to the schiff moment .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the neutral diatomic molecule tan which has been identified as a promising candidate in edm searches @xcite for various reasons .",
    "deformed nuclei such as the @xmath14ta nucleus exhibit a strong enhancement of the mqm relative to that of spherical nuclei , roughly one order of magnitude , which increases the prospect of measuring an ensuing @xmath1-odd shift .",
    "the mqm is directly related to the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ( @xmath12)-violating parameter @xmath15 @xcite . furthermore , an mqm can arise _ via _ edms of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks , @xmath18 , and _ via _ chromo - edms , @xmath19 @xcite in the framework of spontaneous @xmath12-violation in the higgs sector @xcite .",
    "the search for the ensuing @xmath1-violating effects in a molecular system may , therefore , further constrain ( or unravel ) beyond - standard - model ( bsm ) hadron physics .",
    "a further asset is the electronic structure of the tan molecule . from earlier experimental and theoretical studies",
    "it is known that tan has an energetically very low - lying @xmath20 state @xcite arising mainly from a @xmath21 electronic configuration .",
    "in other valence - isoelectronic candidate molecules such as tho @xcite and hff@xmath22 @xcite this state is deeply bound and exhibits a very small magnetic moment which facilitates experimental studies and helps reduce the vulnerability of experiments to decoherence and systematic errors @xcite .    in the present work we have pursued several goals .",
    "we have implemented the nuclear - mqm - electronic - magnetic - field interaction constant @xmath23 as an expectation value into our four - component relativistic correlated all - electron approaches .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] documents the underlying theory , details of the implementation , as well as a brief account of the electronic - structure method for obtaining the required molecular wavefunctions . in section [ sec : appl ] we present the first detailed theoretical spectroscopic study of the tan molecule including leading relativistic effects described in the framework of four - component dirac theory .",
    "apart from spectroscopic constants for low - lying electronic states we also discuss computed molecular electric dipole moments and transition dipole moments .",
    "furthermore , we present and discuss different @xmath1-odd interaction constants relevant to the search for molecular edms , as well as the parallel magnetic hyperfine interaction constant for the @xmath14ta nucleus with spin @xmath24 . the final section [ sec : summ ] is dedicated to conclusions drawn from our present findings .",
    "the four - component molecular dirac wavefunctions including the contributions of dynamic electron correlation have been obtained using a configuration interaction approach implemented in the ` kr - ci ` module @xcite of the ` dirac11 ` @xcite program package . throughout the present study we have used the all - electron dirac - coulomb hamiltonian operator in born - oppenheimer approximation @xmath25                    + \\sum\\limits_{i , j > i}\\ , \\frac{1}{r_{ij}}{1\\!\\!1}_4 + \\sum\\limits_{a , b > a}\\ , v_{ab},\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the potential - energy operator for electron @xmath27 in the electric field of nucleus @xmath28 , @xmath29 is a unit @xmath30 matrix and @xmath31 represents the potential energy due to the internuclear classical electrostatic repulsion of the clamped nuclei .",
    "the molecular wavefunctions are defined as a linear expansion into slater determinants , the latter being formed from the basis of molecular time - reversal paired 4-spinors ( kramers partners , @xmath32 ) , inter - related as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 where the pauli matrices are defined for particle @xmath36 in a cartesian basis and @xmath37 is the complex conjugation operator . for the one - fermion case , setting @xmath38 and taylor expanding the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ eq_k_manybody ] ) results in the one - body time - reversal operator @xmath39 with @xmath40 a dirac operator .",
    "the expansion coefficients of the molecular kramers pairs in terms of the atomic basis sets are obtained from an all - electron dirac - coulomb hartree - fock ( dchf ) calculation .",
    "the slater determinant expansion for the wavefunction then reads @xmath41 with @xmath42 the dimension of the truncated @xmath43-particle fock - space sector over @xmath44 molecular 4-spinors and expansion coefficients @xmath45 varied by diagonalizing the matrix representation of @xmath46 in the slater determinant basis . in this step which takes into account the correlation part of the electron - electron interaction , the determinants",
    "are represented by strings of creation operators in second quantization as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath43 is the number of explicitly treated electrons .",

    "the nuclear mqm has two contributions @xcite .",
    "the first contribution is due to a possible nucleon edm , proportional to @xmath63 cm .",
    "the second is due to a @xmath1-odd nuclear potential , proportional to the fermi constant , order of magnitude @xmath64 ev @xmath65 . due to the smallness of the ensuing energy shift and the typical energy differences @xmath66 between electronic states in diatomic molecules",

    "this can only be the case if @xmath119 and @xmath118 come from different atomic contributions to a molecular spinor , reflecting the fact that the molecular spinors are not parity eigenfunctions .",
    "after the computation of these integrals in the atomic spinor basis , an integral transformation is performed into the molecular spinor basis using the expansion coefficients from a preceding dchf calculation , yielding one - electron integrals of the type @xmath121 in eq .",

    "in addition to the above @xmath1-odd interaction constants we investigate in the present work magnetic hyperfine interaction which serves as an evaluation quantity for the quality of electronic wavefunctions , since spin density close to nuclei is probed .",
    "the parallel hyperfine constant is defined as follows : @xmath130 where @xmath28 designates a nucleus , @xmath131 is a vector of dirac matrices , and @xmath132 is the position vector relative to nucleus @xmath28 .",
