    "this paper concludes a long analysis , begun in @xcite , concerning the global existence in time of weak entropy solutions for a system of conservation laws modeling phase transitions in a fluid .",
    "more precisely , the focus of the analysis is on the persistence of solutions with _",
    "stationary interfaces_.    the system under consideration consists of three equations , namely , @xmath1 where the state variables @xmath20,+\\infty [ \\times { { \\mathbb{r}}}\\times [ 0,1 ] $ ] denote the specific volume , the velocity and the mass - density fraction of the vapor in the fluid , respectively .",
    "system is the conservative part of a more complex model first introduced in @xcite , one of whose novelties lies in the pressure @xmath3 , which depends not only on @xmath4 but also on @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , the pressure is prescribed by the law @xmath6 where the @xmath7 function @xmath8 is assumed to be strictly positive in @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "for example , we can take @xmath10 for some positive constant @xmath11 .",
    "a related example of pressure law occurs in the theory of ( non - isothermal ) ionized gases . in that case",
    ", we have @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the universal gas constant , the molecular mass and the temperature , respectively , while @xmath16 is the ionization degree ; if @xmath17 the gas is not ionized . in that model , however , @xmath16 is usually assigned as a given function of both @xmath3 and @xmath15 by saha s law @xcite while , in the case under consideration , the mass - density fraction @xmath5 is understood as an independent variable .",
    "system is strictly hyperbolic in @xmath18 ; the eigenvalues @xmath19 are genuinely nonlinear while @xmath20 is linearly degenerate . as a consequence , the field associated to",
    "this latter eigenvalue supports contact discontinuities , which are understood in the model as _",
    "phase interfaces_.    the cauchy problem for includes the initial data @xmath21 the global existence ( in time ) of solutions to the initial - value problem for any strictly hyperbolic system of conservation laws whose eigenvalues do not change type is well - known and can be proved either with the glimm scheme or with a front tracking algorithm , see @xcite .",
    "the case of _ large _ initial data is a challenging problem and can be tackled only for special systems ; then , the issue is _ to find classes of initial data with ( large ) total variation for which global solutions to the cauchy problem exist_. this topic was studied in @xcite and @xcite in the case of the isothermal , respectively isentropic , @xmath3-system , see also @xcite ; these results were extended in the seminal papers @xcite to the case of nonisentropic gas dynamics .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for the extension of nishida s result to the initial - value problem in special relativity .",
    "as far as - is concerned , a positive answer was first given in @xcite and then in @xcite . in particular , in the former paper an _ explicit _ threshold of the @xmath0-norm of the initial data was provided in order to have the global existence of solutions .",
    "moreover , both papers require a sort of balance of the @xmath0-norm of the initial data : the larger the variation of @xmath22 , the smaller the variation of @xmath23 and vice - versa .",
    "it would be interesting to prove whether or not , for general @xmath0-data , the solution exists globally in time .",
    "motivated by the techniques introduced in @xcite , we considered in @xcite the special case of initial data where @xmath24 which models the dynamics of a two - phases fluid . in order to deal with this particular framework , an original riemann solver was proposed by which we proved the global existence of solutions for a wide class of large initial data .",
    "such results improved by far those of @xcite when adapted to that setting .",
    "we briefly mention that the problem of _ smooth _ perturbations of riemann - type solutions has been studied by many authors , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the next step regarded the case of initial data with _ two _ phase interfaces , namely , @xmath25 where @xmath26 are constant in @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath27 are the location of the waves ; denote @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "clearly , this case is much more complicated than the previous one , because of the possible bouncing back and forward of the waves in the middle region @xmath31 $ ] . in @xcite",
    "we answered in the positive to the above issue by assuming the condition @xmath32 ; if @xmath4 is fixed , then the pressure in the middle region is lower than the pressure in the outside regions .",
    "we also recovered the results of @xcite by passing to the limit when either @xmath33 or @xmath34 . to give a physical flavor to the problem ,",
    "assume for a moment that the function @xmath35 is increasing with @xmath5 , as is the interesting case in modeling .",
    "then the condition above also means that the mass - density fraction of vapor inside @xmath31 $ ] is less than outside : for brevity , we address to this case as the _ drop _ case .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on the model and references .",
    "in this paper , we deal with the two remaining cases , namely , @xmath36 since the case @xmath37 can be deduced by the latter . reminding of the previous physical interpretation , we shall loosely address to these cases as the _ bubble _ case and the _ increasing - pressure _ case , respectively .",
    "as in @xcite , we introduce two special riemann solvers .",
    "both of them replace the standard non - physical waves @xcite by waves defined through _ integral curves _ ; this allows us to attach these waves to the phase waves .",
    "then , following again the lines of @xcite , we introduce an asymmetrical  glimm functional @xmath38 , in the sense that its interaction potential @xmath39 takes into account only certain shock waves approaching the phase waves while , on the contrary , all rarefaction waves approaching the phase waves are included .",
    "we point out that the definition of @xmath38 differs in each of the three cases mentioned above .",
    "a key feature of both @xcite and the current paper is the possible occurrence of a _ stability condition _ , depending on the case under consideration , to control interactions in the middle zone .",
    "more precisely , such a condition is needed both in the drop and in the increasing - pressure cases and imposes bounds to the strengths of the phase waves . however , in the bubble case we require no stability condition and , as a consequence , any phase wave is admitted .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "the main result is stated in section  [ sec : main ] . in section  [ sec : prelim ] we introduce the riemann solvers , the composite waves and , at last , we define the functional @xmath38 ; we also recall some background facts from @xcite .",
    "sections  [ sec : interbubble ] and  [ sec : interdstep ] focus on the bubble and on the monotone - pressure cases , respectively ; in particular , we prove there that the functional @xmath38 decreases at every interaction . the last section  [ sec : convergence ] deals with the two cases at the same time ; by showing the convergence of the front tracking algorithm we conclude the proof of the main result .",
    "in this section we state the main results of this paper , which concerns the existence of solutions to the cauchy problem - , . under the notation defined in the introduction , we set @xmath40 the quantities @xmath41 and @xmath42 range over @xmath43 - 2,2[\\,$ ] ; they are the strengths of the two contact discontinuities ( see below ) that support the phase interfaces of the model , located at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath46 the three regions separated by @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the @xmath47-plane , see figure  [ fig:0 ] .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , we focus on the _ bubble _ case , which corresponds to consider @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and on the _ increasing - pressure _ case , which corresponds to both @xmath48 and @xmath50 .",
