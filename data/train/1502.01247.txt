    "hot nuclear matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions exhibits its properties through the collective expansion of the fireball .",
    "in addition to the longitudinal flow which is largely set by the initial transparency of the nuclei , pressure gradients drive strong expansion also perpendicularly to the collision axis . due to expansion and cooling",
    "the fireball eventually arrives to the state where it disintegrates .",
    "this is the moment when most abundant hadrons obtain their observed momenta and momentum spectra are frozen - out .",
    "in fact , it does not happen instantaneously for all hadrons .",
    "freeze - out is a continuous process .",
    "it is useful to describe the freeze - out state of the fireball by hydrodynamically inspired parametrisations .",
    "they usually assume that freeze - out happens instantaneously along some hypersurface .",
    "the models include locally thermalized momentum distribution and some pattern of longitudinal and transverse expansion flow velocity .",
    "a few parametrisations are on the market @xcite which differ in details of the assumptions for the density and velocity profiles or the exact shape of the freeze - out hypersurface . in our analysis",
    "we shall make use of the so - called blast - wave model @xcite .    an important part of final state hadrons does not originate directly from the fireball but comes from decays of unstable resonances which themselves were emitted from the fireball .",
    "hadron production by resonance decays is clearly substantial for pions .",
    "however , it also contributes largely to protons and kaons , as we will show below . in spite of this , it is often omitted in calculations and analyses due to its computational complexity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compare monte - carlo - generated transverse momentum spectra with the data measured in pb+pb collisions at @xmath0  tev by alice collaboration @xcite .",
    "our simulation follows the prescription of the blast - wave model .",
    "the monte carlo treatment has been chosen because in this way we are able to include also the resonance production of hadrons into the simulation .",
    "a similar analysis of rhic spectra can be found in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to deduce the values of kinetic freeze - out temperature and transverse expansion velocity much more reliably than in fits with only direct thermal production included , e.g.  @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the relevant features of our monte carlo model  the package dragon @xcite . in section [ s : data ]",
    "we study how resonance production of hadrons affects @xmath5 spectra . as a cross - check of our approach",
    "we have also performed an analysis identical to @xcite and then show how results change if resonances are included .",
    "our main results are presented in section [ s : results ] .",
    "we have fitted @xmath5 spectra of pions , kaons , ( anti)protons , and @xmath6 s @xcite and also looked at @xmath7 s and @xmath8 s @xcite . from the resulting fireball freeze - out parameters we calculated spectra of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and compared them with the measured data @xcite .",
    "we show our values of the parameters for six different centrality classes .",
    "multistrange baryons seem to drop out of the systematics that describes other hadrons .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ s : conc ] .",
    "our analysis is performed in framework of the blast - wave model , which is characterised by its emission function .",
    "formally , it is the wigner phase - space density of the source of hadrons of type @xmath9 @xmath10 because of the dominant expansion in the longitudinal direction one uses longitudinal proper time @xmath11 and space - time rapidity @xmath12 .",
    "polar coordinates @xmath13 , @xmath14 are used in the transverse plane .",
    "we use proper quantum statistical distributions with @xmath15 @xmath16 for fermions ( bosons ) and @xmath17 is the spin degeneracy .",
    "every isospin state is treated separately .",
    "this prescription assumes sharp freeze - out along the hypersurface @xmath18 and uniform density distribution within the radius @xmath19 .",
    "this means that our freeze - out time does not depend on radial coordinate spectra measured by alice collaboration recently @xcite . ] .",
    "the expansion of the fireball is represented by the velocity field @xmath20 where the transverse velocity is such that @xmath21 in this relation @xmath22 parametrises transverse flow gradient and @xmath23 the profile of the transverse velocity .",
    "the mean transverse velocity is then @xmath24 the transverse size @xmath19 and the freeze - out proper time @xmath25 influence total normalizations of transverse momentum spectra .",
    "however , in this study we ignore those and hence we have no sensitivity to these geometric parameters .    from the emission function , spectrum of directly produced hadrons is obtained as @xmath26 where the integration runs over the whole freeze - out hypersurface . if one replaces the quantum - statistical distribution in eq .",
    "( [ e : sfun ] ) by the classical boltzmann distribution and performs some of the integrations in eq .",
    "( [ e : sspec ] ) , one arrives at @xmath27 this formula is rather easy to evaluate and thus it is often used in spectra fitting .",
    "resonances are emitted as described by the emission function in eq .",
    "( [ e : sfun ] ) and then decay exponentially in time according to their width .",
    "all matrix elements for the decays are assumed to be constant and thus the decay is determined by the phase - space only . in principle , one can derive the emission function that includes hadrons from resonance decays @xcite but the expression  unlike eq .",
    "( [ e : dirspec])is not suitable for massively multiple use in the fitting procedure",
    ".    therefore , we generate stable hadrons and also resonances according to distribution @xmath28 and the assumption of chemical equilibrium .",
    "resonances are then let to decay so that in the end we look only at stable hadrons . in our simulation we will systematically vary the temperature @xmath29 , transverse flow gradient @xmath22 , and the power @xmath23 .",
    "we construct histograms in @xmath5 for some number of monte carlo events for each set of @xmath30 parameters which are then compared with measured data and a value of @xmath31 is obtained .",
    "this procedure is rather cpu and storage - demanding because the generation must be done separately for each set of parameters that we want to check .",
    "the share of hadrons coming from resonance decays in our model is set at the chemical freeze - out specified by @xmath32  mev and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "note that shifting these values slightly is not expected to cause a big change in the _ shape _ of the transverse momentum spectra .",
    "this value of chemical freeze - out temperature was found to reproduce the _ ratios _ of hadron multiplicities @xcite and we keep it in order to satisfy that observation .",
    "since the thermal freeze - out temperature is lower , we actually assume here that the time between chemical and thermal freeze - out is so short that the majority of resonances does not decay so that their products would rescatter .",
    "the opposite extreme scenario ( not studied here ) is that strong interactions regenerate some number of resonances .",
    "this must happen so that the state of _ partial chemical equilibrium _ is established , because the final observed numbers of stable hadrons is fixed to the values that correspond to the chemical freeze - out state . thus in partial chemical equilibrium the loss of pions due to fewer resonances that decay would have to be exactly compensated by the increase of the number of direct pions",
    ". the real scenario may likely be somewhere in between these two extreme models .",
    "another possibility is the scenario with single chemical and thermal freeze - out @xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "due to fast transverse expansion at the lhc , here we assume only short time between chemical and thermal freeze - out which keeps basically all resonances according to the chemical freeze - out temperature . at the chemical freeze - out , all hadrons are produced from the same common volume .",
    "then , in the short time of further expansion the volume occupied by each species may be slightly different due to the difference in their thermal velocities .",
    "same kind of model has been applied also in an analysis of nuclear collisions at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "data from pb+pb collisions at @xmath0  tev were measured by the alice collaboration .",
    "spectra of the most abundant species  pions , kaons , protons and antiprotons  were published in @xcite along with a simple thermal fit to the spectra which included only directly produced particles and no resonance decay effect .",
    "an effort has been made to identify fiducial intervals in @xmath5 where the influence of resonance decays can be omitted .",
    "they were @xmath34 for pions , @xmath35 for kaons and @xmath36 for protons .",
    "as we first wanted to set the benchmark and compare our method to other analyses , we performed the same blast - wave model fit with the same fiducial intervals as @xcite using our monte carlo approach instead of eq .",
    "( [ e : dirspec ] ) .",
    "event samples were generated for different sets of parameters @xmath30 .",
    "the parameter space was sampled so that the step in temperature was 4  mev , the step in @xmath22 was 0.01 , and the step in @xmath23 was 0.02 or 0.04 .",
    "each of these steps induces roughly the same amount of change in the resulting spectra .",
    "the step size was compromised in view of the cpu time required and has impact on the precision with which we can locate the parameter set that fits the data best .",
    "explored parameter sets were chosen so that we always explore large enough region in parameter space around the best fit .",
    "we checked that the generated spectra are accurately described by eq .",

    "note that the freeze - out temperature in peripheral collisions is higher than in the central ones .",
    "the spectra in those collisions are thus less sensitive to the mass of particles .",
    "what we see here is an illustration of the ambiguity in determination of @xmath29 and @xmath37 .",
    "lower temperature can be compensated by stronger flow and vice - versa .",
    "when spectra depend on the mass , this ambiguity is usually resolved by different shapes of @xmath5 spectra of different species .",
    "figure  [ f : bestfit ] indicates that statistically one can still resolve the fit to multistrange baryons as the uniquely correct result .",
    "alice collaboration has also published transverse momentum spectra of resonances @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "studying resonances may reveal information about the dynamics of the fireball , particularly its evolution between chemical and thermal freeze - out . in order to simulate these resonances",

    "if it is produced from the thermalized fireball at the common freeze - out , then its spectrum must be close to that of protons . in fig .",
    "[ f : phi ] we compare the data with predictions based on parameters from table  [ t : bestfits ] .",
    "data seem to be slightly steeper than the prediction .",
    "this is best seen in the ratios @xmath49 plotted in the lower panels of the figure .",
    "such a disagreement might indicate slightly earlier freeze - out from the fireball .",
    "note , however , that the deviation of the prediction from the data is much smaller than in the case of multistrange baryons and no indisputable sign of earlier decoupling can be claimed .",
    "the blast - wave model with hadron production from resonance decays included can well reproduce single - particle spectra measured by alice collaboration in pb+pb collisions at @xmath0  tev .",
    "resonance contribution leads to shifts in the values of freeze - out parameters .",
    "for central collisions our freeze - out temperatures tend to be lower than those extracted by alice @xcite . on the other hand , the temperatures shift in the opposite direction for peripheral collisions .",
    "shifts in @xmath37 have smaller relative size .",
    "multistrange baryons show freeze - out at higher temperature and weaker transverse flow .",
    "this is consistent with earlier decoupling from the fireball .",
    "note that such a behaviour is known from sps @xcite and rhic @xcite data , as well .",
    "in fits to data from most peripheral collisions we obtain temperatures for kinetic freeze - out that are higher than what is usually assumed for the chemical freeze - out .",
    "on one side we can take this result as a parametrisation and the values of parameters are those which fit the data best .",
    "however , as soon as we want to interpret these values in the framework of some scenario for the fireball evolution , we may be witnessing limitations of the used model .    in principle , our assumption of chemical equilibrium may seem inconsistent with individual normalisation of each spectrum as we performed it . if different spectra are multiplied with different factors this can be seen as effectively changing relative numbers of final state species .",
    "caution would be particularly in place if we tried to predict the absolute yields of final hadron species . here , however , we wanted to enhance the sensitivity to @xmath29 and @xmath52 and thus we focussed on the shapes of the spectra which remain intact by the individual normalizations . indeed ,",
    "although rescaling one spectrum might have an influence on another one through changing yields of resonances which also contribute to a different final state species ( like e.g.  @xmath69 contributing to pions and nucleons ) , this does not tie different spectra too strongly together .",
    "the reason is that the main contributing resonance decays are different for different hadron species : for pions the most important are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 @xcite ; for protons the @xmath69 resonance ; for @xmath6 the @xmath73 and @xmath74 hyperons ; for kaons the @xmath3 . thus rescaling the yield for one species does not have much influence on another species .",
    "a more complete analysis would include also the model interpretation of the normalisations which are given by the volume .",
    "such an analysis , however , must include femtoscopy and is planned for the future .",
    "similar fits were performed recently with the cracow single freeze - out model @xcite .",
    "the main feature of that model is common chemical and thermal freeze - out with non - equilibrium fugacities introduced for strange and also non - strange species . due to this , the freeze - out temperature fitted there is generally higher than our results .",
    "note however , that their freeze - out hypersurface has a different shape .",
    "naturally , this opens the question if one can distinguish between the two models .",
    "perhaps femtoscopy can provide the tool for this task .",
    "it is an intriguing speculation if the two approaches may be equivalent .",
    "here we recall the scenario that matter hadronizes and cools down while keeping partial chemical equilibrium .",
    "this leads to the appearance of non - equilibrium chemical potentials for all species , i.e.  chemical potentials that are not given by chemical potentials of conserved quantum numbers @xcite . in the single freeze - out model ,",
    "on the other hand , the system is born into the chemical non - equilibrium .",
    "we wonder how close to this non - equilibrium state the fireball comes in the cooling fireball scenario .      finally , let us come back to the issue that our results have been obtained in a scenario which assumes different chemical and thermal freeze - out and the difference between their temperatures is rather high .",
    "if one would revisit the question of the evolution between them , the inclusion of chemical potentials may be important .",
    "they may have influence on the shape of @xmath5 spectra especially for pions and we seem to observe the corresponding features in the data . this task will be addressed in a subsequent paper .",
