    "fifty years ago sandage ( 1953 ) discovered a unique class of stars , the blue stragglers ( bss ) . in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of clusters ,",
    "these stars appear brighter and bluer than the main sequence turn - off .",
    "they appear in the cmd of open and globular clusters ( gc ) , as well as in the field , and their brightnesses and colors are consistent with evolutionary models for stars more massive than the cluster ( or population ) turn - off .",
    "to explain how stars more massive than the cluster s turn - off stars could still be present in gcs , or in old populations , several scenarios have been proposed .",
    "after years of debate ( for a review , see bailyn 1995 ) , the consensus has settled on stellar collisions or binary mass transfer and mergers as the most likely events responsible for the formation of bs stars .",
    "bs populations have a great diversity of properties .",
    "for instance , their specific frequencies and mean brightnesses vary greatly .",
    "it is likely that these differences are due to differences in the clusters dynamical histories .",
    "however , to date , attempts to correlate bs population photometric properties with other cluster parameters have failed to determine the formation scenarios most likely to apply ( e.g. , piotto et al .",
    "2004 ) . as a result ,",
    "the information the bs population contains about the history of its cluster s dynamics remains inaccessible due to our ignorance of the bs formation channels .",
    "critical bs properties which have not been fully investigated due to the difficulty of the observations are their masses and rotation rates . whether the bss are the result of a collision or a binary merger , they are expected to be more massive than the main sequence turn - off mass .",
    "however , models of the two scenarios do not predict bss which are systematically different , with the exception that masses larger than twice the turn - off mass for the cluster are likely to be the result of 3-body collisions .",
    "the fact that bss are more centrally - concentrated than subgiants , and , by inference , than to stars , already suggested that bss are more massive than the clusters turn - off mass ( nemec & harris 1987 ) .",
    "spectroscopic evidence that bs masses are larger than the turn - off mass for the cluster was previously obtained by shara et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who measured the mass of one of the most luminous bs in the core of 47  tuc , showing that it has twice the cluster s turn - off mass .",
    "this determination was also confirmed by ouellette ( 2000 ) in a distance - independent way , by comparing stellar temperatures and gravities with evolutionary calculations .",
    "saffer et al . ( 2002 ) carried out a spectroscopic analysis on 6 bss in ngc  6397 , also deriving masses higher than the turn - off mass for 5 out of 6 objects .",
    "masses larger than the cluster turn - off were also reported for 4 bss by gilliland et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , based on their pulsation frequency measurements .",
    "however the distribution of the bs masses remains an open question since the samples analyzed were invariably small . since mass predictions do not yet allow us to differentiate between formation scenarios , one can hope that determining masses for a large enough sample will reveal correlations with other stellar and cluster properties .",
    "rotation rates for stars formed either through collisions or binary mergers are also expected to be higher than normal .",
    "simulations of collision mergers ( e.g. , sills et al . 2002 , 2005 ) ,",
    "show merger product to be rapidly rotating .",
    "simulations of main sequence binary mergers are lacking , but it is likely that these systems also inherit considerable angular momentum .",
    "however , rotation rates measured for bss in open cluster m67 appear to be _ lower _ than those for comparable main - sequence stars ( mathys 1991 ) .",
    "shara et al .",
    "( 1997 ) determined the stellar rotation for the 47  tuc bs bss19 to be a high @xmath2 = 155  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "theoretically , rapidly - rotating bss are expected to slow down : sills et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argue that a magnetically - locked accretion disk or wind can draw angular momentum from the star and slow it down .",
    "however , matt & pudritz ( 2005 ) have recently argued that this might not be the case .",
    "de marco et al . ( 2004 ) suggested that low mass disks might be present around some bss , but porter & townsend ( 2005 ) showed that the same data can also be interpreted by accounting for the distortion of the stellar shape due to rotation .",
    "it is clear that a great deal of work remains to be done both observationally and theoretically .    with all this in mind",
    ", we obtained hubble space telescope ( hst ) spectroscopic observations of a sample of bss drawn from four different clusters with different central concentration ( 47  tucanae [ 47  tuc ; ngc  104 ] , m  3 [ ngc5272 ] , ngc  6752 and ngc  6397 ) , to determine spectroscopic masses and rotation rates .    in section  [ sec : observations ] we describe our hst observations .",
    "the details of the spectroscopic data reduction and extraction are given in section  [ sec : datareduction ] . in section  [ sec : photometry ] we present the stellar photometry , while in section  [ sec : identification ] we use the photometry to classify the analyzed stars . in section",
    "[ sec : stellarparameters ] we derive the stellar parameters , followed by an assessment of the uncertainties in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] .",
    "stellar masses and rotation rates are presented in sections  [ sec : masses ] and [ sec : rotation ] , respectively . in section",
    "[ sec : disk ] we describe the spectroscopic indicators of circumstellar disks or rapid rotation , while in section  [ sec : individualobjects ] individual stars are discussed . a comparison with stellar evolutionary models",
    "is presented in section  [ sec : evolutionarytracks ] , followed by our summary in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in order to obtain a sizable sample of bss , we selected three clusters , rich in bss : 47  tuc ( ngc  104 ) , m  3 ( ngc  5272 ) and ngc  6752 .",
    "we also re - analyzed data for the cluster ngc  6397 , in which 6 bss and one hb star were previously identified and analyzed by saffer et al .",
    "these clusters span a range in metallicity and central star density .",
    "details of the clusters are presented in table  [ tab : clusterproperties ] .",
    "the cmds of these clusters are presented in figures  [ fig : cmd_ngc104_bv ] to [ fig : cmd_ngc6397_uv ] , where the bss can be clearly seen at positions brighter and bluer than the main sequence turn - off .",
    "spectra of stars in the gcs 47  tuc , m  3 and ngc  6752 were acquired through hst proposal go-8226 ( pi : shara ) , using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) between april 1999 and may 2000 , with a few frames acquired in march 2001 .",
    "low ( grating g430l ) and intermediate ( grating g430 m ) resolution spectroscopy was obtained using the 52@xmath50.5  arcsec@xmath6 slit .",
    "this setup afforded 5.5-  resolution spectra in the range 3200 - 5600    and 0.56-resolution spectra in the range 3800 - 4100   .",
    "the slit width was chosen to allow some uncertainty in the target acquisition , in view of the fact that more than one target was to be observed per slit .",
    "several slit positions were used for each cluster .",
    "each slit position was chosen so as to maximize the number of bss that fell in the slit .",
    "hst / fos ( faint object spectrograph ) spectroscopy of 6 bss and one hb star in ngc  6397 ( proposal go-6697 ; pi : de marchi ) was acquired on october 5 , 1996 using the g400h ( wavelength range 32404822   ) and g570h ( wavelength range 45746872   ) gratings with the 0.5-arcsec aperture .",
    "this setup afforded 2.82 and 4.09-  resolution for the g400h and g570h gratings , respectively ( using the nominal 3.07 and 4.45   per diode for the g400h and g570h gratings , respectively , and the size of the post - costar full width at half maximum [ fwhm ] of 0.92 diodes for the 0.5-arcsec aperture ) . in table  [ tab : observations ] we present a log of the observations .",
    "hst / stis image names are listed in column 1 followed , in column 2 , by our own stellar identification names .",
    "ra & dec ( column 3 ) and pixel positions ( column 4 ) were determined on the images displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig:47tuc_image ] to [ fig : ngc6397_image ] .",
    "the slit positions ( column 5 ) are the y - pixel positions of the stellar spectra on the stis images . in column  6",
    "we list distances from the respective clusters centers .",
    "finally , point - spread - function ( psf ) photometry carried out on wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images is presented in columns 7 to 10 ( described in detail in section  [ sec : photometry ] ) .",
    "the entire go-8226 and go-6697 datasets were downloaded from the hst archive at the canadian astronomy data center ( cadc ) in march 2001 , with  on - the - fly \" calibration and processed ( sepinsky et al .",
    "2002 ) to reduce the number of cosmic ray hits which were not eliminated by the automatic pipeline calibration .    despite the 0.043-arcsec per pixel spatial resolution of the stis / hst , spectroscopy of gc stars",
    "is affected by severe blending , so that spectral extraction is a real challenge and a source of uncertainty .",
    "the size of the extracting aperture is a compromise between minimizing contamination from other stars ( width of the aperture @xmath75 pixels ) and insuring the full sampling of the spatial psf ( width of the aperture between 8 and 12 pixels ) .",
    "the psf shape is wavelength dependent , with more and more stellar flux residing in the psf s wings for longer wavelengths .",
    "because of this , small apertures tend to extract spectra which are systematically bluer ( less flux falls within the aperture at longer wavelengths ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : disk_spatialcut ] we show spatial cuts of the stis frames containing four stars from two clusters taken at three wavelength positions , corresponding to the central wavelengths of the johnson @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 filter band passes .",
    "the limits of the apertures used to extract the 4 stars , as well as the adopted background level are also shown . in three out of four cases",
    "the star is blended with a very faint neighbor which is not bright enough , nor close enough to contribute substantial flux . in the fourth case , the neighbor is brighter , but again , not close enough to constitute a problem .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : aperture_test ] we present star n5272 - 11 , extracted using three aperture widths : 2 pixels , 4 pixels and 8 pixels .",
    "as already described , the flux in the smaller two apertures is bluer and somewhat distorted .",
    "the large 8-pixel aperture allows flux from one faint neighbor to contribute .",
    "it was found that apertures larger than 8 pixels increase contamination but the shape of the spectrum remains unchanged .",
    "hence , 8-pixel apertures are large enough to not incur the psf problem , but small enough to not incur severe blending .",
    "overall , we maintain that we have carried out the best reduction and extraction that can be carried out with these data .",
    "a better reduction and extraction demands the use of software that can deconvolve blended spectra . during the analysis of the data ,",
    "great attention has been put into checking the individual extractions before attributing an uncertainty to the derived parameters .",
    "we have carefully tracked the uncertainties and propagated them into our results ( section  [ sec : uncertainties ] and table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "in order to determine spectroscopic masses one has to scale the stellar atmosphere model fluxes to observed ( de - reddened ) stellar fluxes .",
    "if the spectra are photometric , one can rely on the spectroscopy alone .",
    "this is not the case for spectra acquired in crowded regions , or when there is a risk that the star is not centered on the slit .",
    "for this reason we scaled our models ( section  [ sec : stellarparameters ] ) not to the spectral fluxes but to stellar photometry from archival wfpc2 images .",
    "we did not expect bss to show significant variability , but some did .",
    "this is in itself an important result of this work .",
    "with hindsight , one should always take photometric observations within a short time of the spectroscopic ones , since parameters derived from spectra taken at a particular variability phase should not be mixed with the brightness derived from photometry taken at a different phase .",
    "variable stars will be discussed in sections  [ sec : identification ] and [ sec : uncertainties ] .",
    "psf photometry was carried out on a subsample of all the available archival hst / wfpc2 images of the four clusters .",
    "a photometric reduction using all the available images will be undertaken elsewhere .",
    "the data ( table  [ tab : photometry ] ) were obtained from the mast database with  on - the - fly \" calibrations .",
    "the photometric reductions were performed using the daophot / allframe software ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "briefly , allframe determines the brightness of each star on each frame with point - spread - function fitting at the same time .",
    "this reduction process increases the accuracy of the photometry by fixing the position of each star across all the frames which increases the accuracy of de - blending the stars .",
    "we calibrated the photometry to the vegamag system ( wfpc2 data handbook ) in order to use the fewest corrections when scaling the atmosphere models ( section  [ sec : stellarparameters ] ) to the observations .",
    "the uncertainty of the photometric magnitudes is estimated to be 0.02  mag for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 filters , 0.03  mag for the @xmath13 filter and 0.04  mag for the @xmath14 one .",
    "a calibration to any  standard \" system ( e.g. , johnson ) includes many additional corrections because the wfpc2 filters are not strictly  standard \" . to convert the wfpc2 magnitudes listed in table  [ tab : observations ] to the johnson system",
    ", one can use the transformations of dolphin ( 2000a , b ) .",
    "the observed stis / vega @xmath14 , @xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 magnitudes obtained from averaging _ all _ images from table  [ tab : photometry ] are listed in table  [ tab : observations ] ( columns 7 to 10 ) .",
    "stellar atmosphere models were scaled to the @xmath11photometric magnitudes to obtain radii , luminosities and spectroscopic masses . for variable stars ,",
    "it is not appropriate to obtain radii by scaling models to photometric magnitudes obtained at a different time from the spectra . for variable stars we determine radii , luminosities and masses by scaling the models to the spectra . in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] we will discuss in detail the uncertainties in this method .",
    "the analyzed stars were identified on wfpc2 images by using the iraf task _ siapier _ to position the stis slit on the image and match stars along the slit to spectra in the stis ccd images . for the fos observations we relied on the coordinates provided in the image header . in figs .",
    "[ fig:47tuc_image ] to [ fig : ngc6397_image ] we present portions of @xmath11  images containing the stars thus identified , which we label according to the scheme presented in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "ra ( to the nearest tenth of second ) and dec ( to the nearest tenth of arc - second ) , as well as pixel coordinates ( to the nearest pixel ) for all analyzed stars were read off the wfpc2 images displayed using ds9 ( joye & mandel 2003 ) and are also listed in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "all stars in the instability strip are susceptible to stellar pulsations .",
    "variable hb stars ( rr lyrae ) have by far the largest brightness amplitudes .",
    "they are typically in the temperature range @xmath1560007300  k and have periods between 0.4 and 1  day .",
    "variable pulsating main sequence stars fall into the @xmath16  scuti or sx  phoenicis classes .",
    "these tend to pulsate with smaller amplitudes ( @xmath150.1  mag ) , although they can occasionally vary more ( 0.4  mag ) and they have periods between 0.04 and 0.2  days .",
    "the typical temperatures for main sequence pulsations are marginally hotter than those of hb stars , and are in the range @xmath157000 - 8200  k ( from allen s astrophysical quantities , 2000 ) .",
    "stars can obviously also vary if they are in eclipsing binary systems .    to identify which ones of our stars are variable , we adopted four methods .",
    "( i ) stars that vary by more than 0.2  mag over multi - epoch same - filter wfpc2 images ( stars n104 - 8 , n5272 - 8 , 9 , 12 , 14 , 15 , n6397 - 5 and 6 in table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "this method does not detect all variables , since it depends on when the individual frames were acquired .",
    "( ii ) stars whose colors clearly vary when combining @xmath14 , @xmath13and @xmath11  magnitudes from images taken at different dates ( stars n104 - 1 , 3 , 6 , n5272 - 8 , 9 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 18 , 20 , n6752 - 17 , n6397 - 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ) .",
    "( iii ) stars whose low- and intermediate - resolution spectra have different flux levels ( stars n104 - 8 ,",
    "n5272 - 13 ) and , finally , ( iv ) stars whose spectral and photometric fluxes and colors are very different ( stars n104 - 2 , n5272 - 13 , n6752 - 5 , 9 , n6397 - 1 , and 2 ) , but the difference is inconsistent with other causes ( explained in detail in section  [ ssec : errvar ] ) . stars which satisfied any of these four criteria are considered variable and are marked  v \" in table  [ tab : results ] and discussed further in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] .    the core of 47  tuc was surveyed for variables by edmonds et al .",
    "none of our 47  tuc stars matches the positions of the variables found in that study , despite the fact that , based on the criteria listed above , five of the 9 stars are variable .",
    "( we note in passing that the positions quoted by edmonds et al . [ 1996 ; their table  2 ] are with reference to star e in guhathakurta et al .",
    "1992 , but the position of that star quoted in that paper [ their table  3 : 00@xmath1721@xmath1852@xmath19.46 72@xmath2021@xmath2131@xmath22.68 [ b1950.0 ] which maps to 00@xmath1724@xmath1805@xmath19.38 72@xmath2004@xmath2154@xmath22.30 [ j2000.0 ] ] does not correspond to any star on the j2000.0 coordinate system of our ccd frame [ e.g. , j6ll01yiq ] . this is not unexpected due to the positional uncertainty of the dss1 system .",

    "cluster membership could not be determined using the radial velocity of the absorption lines of the stars in our sample , because we can not derive a sufficiently precise wavelength calibration from our spectra .",
    "the reason for this is that the stis spectra are taken through the wide 0.5-arcsec slit and a star s wavelength is a function of its exact position in slit .",
    "we can , however , assess that foreground contamination is close to zero",
    ". from the total number of stars in the guide star catalogue ( version ii ; 170,000,000 to a limiting photographic j magnitude of 19.5 [ @xmath23 ) we can estimate that there is @xmath151 star arcmin@xmath24 on average in the sky .",
    "all our stars are two or more magnitudes brighter .",
    "furthermore , close to the high galactic latitudes characteristic of our four gcs ( 28@xmath20@xmath2572@xmath20 ) there are often zero .",
    "following the referee s suggestion , we also used the calculations by robin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to estimate the number of foreground stars in the direction of the four gcs . using the gcs galactic coordinates , a distance smaller than 10  kpc , and restricting the stellar types to the apparent @xmath10 magnitude and color ranges of the stars in our list .",
    "the simulated number of foreground stars is zero for solid angles comparable to the angles subtended by the gc cores ( typically 1  arcmin@xmath6 ) . even enlarging the solid angle to 10  deg@xmath6",

    "it is important to emphasize that while there will be a minimum @xmath54 value for which the fit is best , the formal error of the procedure is an underestimate of the true uncertainty .",

    "thus the five bss with measured @xmath2 suggest an average rotation velocity of @xmath79  km  s@xmath3 . from values of radii and masses of these stars",

    "both scenarios predict that the resulting star should have a large angular momentum , and it should rotate very fast , especially when it starts to contract following the post - formation expansion . even if one scenario predicted a slower rotation rate than the other , one would still have to contend with the various mechanisms that are likely to slow the initially - fast - rotating star down .",
    "the often - cited paper by leonard and livio ( 1995 ) predicts that collision mergers puff up enough to develop a convective zone that would slow the star down , while binary mergers coalesce less violently and expand less , such that no convective layer is expected and can not therefore lose angular momentum efficiently .",
    "however this is in contradiction with the recent calculations of sills et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who predict that the product of an off - axis collision does not develop a convective layer so the leonard and livio mechanism can not operate .",
    "sills et al .",
    "( 2005 ) do however show that a disk , or even a magnetically locked wind can slow the star down , therefore providing an alternative slow - down mechanism for collision mergers .",
    "it appears that there is quite a bit of work still to be done in modeling bss .",
    "on the other hand these models need to be guided by observations and the only way to make headway observationally is to carry out an analysis similar to the one carried out here on a very large dataset spanning several gcs as well as open clusters and the field .",
    "in particular , field bss are fundamental since they are highly unlikely to derive from collisions .",
    "field bss should therefore display characteristics which should make them stand aside from the rest of the bss .",
    "higher resolution and snr spectra should be obtained , however , since only then can rotation rates be determined in a meaningful way .",
    "we should also note that all six @xmath2 values for hb stars ( all of which are ehb stars ) , are @xmath8050  km  s@xmath3 , including one at 200@xmath6950  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "values these high are not common for hb stars ( e.g. , behr 2003 ) .",

    "this , they argue , could also explain the high rotation rates found by lanz et al .",
    "it is therefore possible that this is the explanation for our rapidly - rotating ehb stars .",

    "an incorrect cluster reddening assumption does not solve the problem either .",
    "blending or binarity was also excluded as the cause of the discrepancy since these effects would push stars to the upper side of the color - color diagram .",
    "no two - temperature model , such as a disk or equatorial enhancement , can account for the discrepancy .    as a result of the impossibility of reconciling the data with the models , de marco et al .",
    "( 2004 ) conjectured that a disk of partly ionized gas is responsible for the absorption of balmer continuum photons .",

    "we refer the reader to that paper for further details and to our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "it is therefore unclear at this point what the presence of disks might mean in the context of bs and other gc stars .",
    "recently , porter and townsend ( 2005 ) modeled the anomalous balmer jump of n5272 - 17 and showed that they can reproduce the data with a rotating star whose shape is made oblate by the centrifugal force .",
    "the rotation rates needed for the effect to explain the data depend on whether the star is viewed pole- or equator - on , but there is a solution for the values of @xmath2 determined for n5272 - 17 and n6752 - 11 ( table  [ tab : rotation ] ) .",
    "their balmer line fits are not of the highest quality , but they ascribe that to not having optimized the overall values of temperature and gravity ( they took the stellar parameters of de marco et al . [",

    "there is however a remaining issue . in fig .",
    "[ fig : disk ] we show the ca  ii k line region of our intermediate resolution spectrum of n5272 - 17 .",
    "this is the same figure as on the upper right - hand panel in fig .  2 of de marco et al .",
    "the ca  ii k line shows three components , a broad , shallow one , interpreted as the stellar , rotationally - broadened component , a narrow one at the same wavelength , due to the putative disk , and a narrow one shifted by the gc s heliocentric velocity and interpreted as arising from the interstellar medium .",
    "if disks are not present , it might be hard to explain the narrow stellar ca  ii k line component .",
    "on the other hand the snr of the data is not high enough to resolve the issue conclusively .",
    "if porter & townsend ( 2005 ) are right , and stellar rotation is solely responsible for the anomalous balmer jumps , then this confirms that four hb stars in our sample are fast rotators .",
    "two ( n5272 - 17 and n6397 - 7 ) are , as we already explained , likely to be bright bss , but the remaining two , ( n5272 - 11 and 16 ) are likely to be bona fide hb stars .",
    "fast - rotating hb stars would be an interesting finding in itself , since rotation this high might indicate a binary interaction in the star s past , leading us to wonder the extent to which binarity influences the evolution of the horizontal branch .",
    "in this section we report the highlights of a subset of our objects which presented particular challenges during the fitting process or which show other peculiarities .    _",
    "n104 - 3 : _ this star is variable and hard to classify without photometric observations taken at the same time .",
    "nonetheless it is likely to be a bs or a to star , rather than an hb star . on the basis of its spectrum alone it appears to be a bs .",
    "its mass , obtained by scaling the model to the spectrum is however only 0.42  @xmath1 .    _",
    "n104 - 5 : _ in this high snr spectrum , all of the metal lines are overestimated by the model .",

    "s@xmath3 the overall fit to the metal lines is slightly improved .",
    "the ca  ii k line fit , however , remains poor .",
    "rotation does not appear to be responsible for the discrepancy between the intermediate resolution spectra and the model .",
    "rather , we conclude that there is a temperature inconsistency between the intermediate resolution spectrum , where a higher model temperature ( by about 300  k ) would achieve a better fit , and the low resolution spectrum , where a higher temperature would misrepresent the paschen continuum ( gravity has little effect in this temperature regime ) .",
    "a lower abundance would help to fit better the intermediate resolution spectrum , although the abundance change needed would be too large and inconsistent with the cluster abundance .    _",
    "n104 - 8 : _ the continuum level of the intermediate resolution spectrum for this bs is about 20% brighter than for the low resolution spectrum .",
    "no reason was found from the data reduction to explain the discrepancy , since the flux levels of the low and intermediate resolution spectra of stars on the same slit are consistent .",
    "this might point to an inherent photometric variability of n104 - 8 .",
    "this star was marked as having a high probability of being a variable on the basis of the photometry described in section  [ sec : photometry ] and [ ssec : errvar ] . as a bs",
    ", this star might be a @xmath16  scuti or a sx  phoenicis pulsating variable , or it might be an eclipsing binary",

    "n5272 - 6 : _ this ehb star must be a slight blend of two stars , since it is impossible to fit perfectly the balmer continuum once the paschen continuum is well fit .",
    "since the gravity can be determined by the balmer line widths in its high - snr intermediate resolution spectrum , we have retained this spectrum in the sample and assigned a larger error to the temperature .    _",

    "n5272 - 15 : _ this bs star has the largest spectroscopic mass encountered ( 3.74@xmath692.26@xmath1 ) .",
    "it was identified as a variable because its magnitude determined from individual images varied by just above 0.20  mag . as a result",
    "we did not scale the stellar atmosphere model flux ( @xmath43 ) to the photometry , but used instead the spectroscopic flux scaled by 0.8 as explained in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] .",
    "one could suppose that the spectrum was blended with that of another star , making @xmath44 artificially bright , and the mass artificially large .",
    "we note however , that even a blend with a star of equal brightness would only make the mass twice as large .",
    "such a blend is excluded on the basis of the imaging , where we see only one star close to n5272 - 15 which has only @xmath1525% of its brightness and its flux was partly - to - mostly excluded from the spectral extraction of n5272 - 15 by the extraction procedure .",
    "a blend with a very bright star is also highly improbable since the most likely candidate would be a red giant and this would be obvious in the spectrum .",
    "the only blend that could feasibly have augmented the stellar flux is one with another bs or an hb star almost coincident in position with n5272 - 15 .",
    "alternatively this star is a main sequence foreground star . with a smaller value of the distance @xmath47",

    "[ fig : col - col2 ] the star has the colors of a 17000-k object , while the balmer continuum is better fit with 18000 k. since we do not know whether the contaminating star is bluer or redder , we adopt an intermediate temperature and increase the uncertainty .    _",

    "<S> we present a spectroscopic analysis of hst / stis and fos low- and intermediate - resolution spectroscopy of 55 stars in four globular clusters ( 47  tucanae , m  3 , ngc  6752 , and ngc  6397 ) . </S>",
    "<S> stars hotter than @xmath0= 5750  k and with a signal - to - noise ratio larger than 15 were analyzed with non - local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmospheres , and values for their effective temperatures and gravities were obtained . using photometric fluxes </S>",
    "<S> , we also obtained radii , luminosities and spectroscopic masses .    </S>",
    "<S> twenty - four stars in our sample are blue stragglers ( bs ) . </S>",
    "<S> their photometric colors and magnitudes place these bss above and redward of the clusters zero - age main sequence : this is consistent with the gravities we find for these stars , which are lower than zero - age main sequence gravities . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with stellar evolutionary tracks shows that almost all of our bss are in the hertzsprung gap . </S>",
    "<S> this is contrary to theory , because of the short timescale expected for stars in this evolutionary phase .    </S>",
    "<S> mean bs masses are 1.04  @xmath1  for 14 non - variable stars , or 1.07  @xmath1  counting all 24 bss in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> for the non - variable stars the mean bs mass for individual clusters are 1.73 , 1.01 , 0.95 and 0.72  @xmath1  for ngc  6397 , ngc  6752 , 47  tuc and m  3 , respectively . adding the variable stars ( which improves the statistics but increases the uncertainty ) the mean masses become 1.27 , 1.05 , 0.99 and 0.99  @xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> though there is considerable scatter , the bs spectroscopic masses correlate with both effective temperature and brightness of the stars , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the bss in    the mean non - variable turn - off star mass ( 0.58  @xmath1 ) is significantly below the values determined for the bss and below the main sequence turn - off mass . </S>",
    "<S> the mean non - variable horizontal - branch ( hb ) star mass is higher than expected ( 0.79  @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , several hb stars have masses well above the main sequence turn - off mass . </S>",
    "<S> some of these hb stars are suspected of actually being bss , since most of them reside at ambiguous locations on the cmd making them prone to misclassification .    </S>",
    "<S> values and limits to the stellar rotation rates ( @xmath2 ) are imposed by fitting weak metal lines , the ca  ii k line wings , or the helium lines for the hotter stars . </S>",
    "<S> five bss with reasonably constrained rotations show average and median @xmath2 values of 109 and 100  km  s@xmath3 , respectively , suggesting @xmath4  km  s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> at least some gc bss are are very rapid rotators , but this information can not yet constrain their origin as stellar collision or binary mergers , because of the lack of clear theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> six extreme hb stars have rotation rates @xmath2 between 50 and 200  km  s@xmath3 , which are high for these stars and might indicate a binary origin .    </S>",
    "<S> de marco et al . found that four bss and two hb star in our sample have balmer jumps which are too large for the effective temperatures implied by the slopes of their paschen continua . </S>",
    "<S> two additional hb stars are now identified in the current study as having the same feature . for these stars , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a disk of partly ionized material is suspected , although high stellar rotation rates could also partly explain the data . </S>"
