    "out - of - equilibrium systems are currently the object of considerable attention both in classical and in quantum physics  @xcite",
    ". an important aspect of out - of - equilibrium physics resides in the study of non - equilibrium steady states of boundary driven systems ( e.g. , two reservoirs at non - equal densities ) , and corresponding fluctuations about the steady state",
    ". a useful approach in the study of non - equilibrium steady states is a hydrodynamic description known as the macroscopic fluctuation theory ( mft )  @xcite .",
    "the mft provides an efficient way to obtain an expression for the probability of observing steady state fluctuations . as such",
    ", the mft has proven useful in obtaining various properties such as out - of - equilibrium density fluctuations  @xcite , clausius inequality  @xcite , emergence of void formations  @xcite , and others  @xcite .",
    "another important problem in that field is the characterization of current fluctuations .",
    "current fluctuations have been thoroughly studied in statistical physics  @xcite as well as in mesoscopic physics  @xcite .",
    "knowledge of current fluctuations allows to measure how close is a fluctuation to the steady state .",
    "moreover , the noisy nature of the measurement allows to obtain information about the system under study  @xcite .",
    "current fluctuations can be obtained from the probability @xmath0 that a net amount of @xmath1 particles ( or any other amount , e.g. , heat ) flowed through the system during a time @xmath2 .",
    "generally , @xmath0 is dominated by a single fluctuation . however , finding it is a hard optimization problem  @xcite .",
    "it was conjectured in  @xcite that the dominant trajectory is time - independent .",
    "this is the content of the additivity principle ( ap ) , which allows to simplify the aforementioned minimization problem , and has proven useful  @xcite .    in certain cases ,",
    "the ap solution may become non - unique , or overtaken by a time - dependent solution . in boundary driven systems , only until recently  @xcite there were no known physical examples of a continuous transition between ap solutions .",
    "moreover , as of yet there is no example of a continuous transition from an ap solution to a time - dependent one ( namely , breaking of the ap assumption  ) , as well as no example of a discontinuous transition between two distinct ap solutions .    by analogy with thermodynamic phase transitions ,",
    "it is useful to interpret a breaking of the ap assumption or a discontinuous transition as a dynamical phase transition ( dpt ) of first and second order , respectively , due to the non - analyticity of @xmath0 at the transition point  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation has been used in  @xcite to help obtaining a sufficient and necessary condition for the validity of the ap for small fluctuations .",
    "note that while one dimensional equilibrium thermodynamic systems with short - range interactions never display phase transitions  @xcite , constrained systems  in or out of equilibrium  may very well present them  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to numerically implement the tools developed in  @xcite for some models of interest .",
    "first , we report a thorough numerical study of the kipnis  marchioro ",
    "presutti ( kmp ) model  @xcite , which shows that it never violates the sufficient and necessary conditions given in  @xcite and for a much broader parameter range than previously explored .",
    "second , we present numerical evidence for either first or second order dpt as a function of the strength of a constrained current in some boundary driven systems .",
    "a physical example for such a process is the long - range hopping with exclusion model proposed by bodineau  @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] , we shortly recapitulate the mft and the calculation of current fluctuations . the ap assumption  as presented in  @xcite  is outlined , and a sufficient and necessary condition for its validity is derived for continuous transitions , similarly to  @xcite .",
    "[ sec : models ] reviews the models we probe numerically for dpts . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present evidence for dynamical phase transitions for each of these models .",
    "[ sec : summary ] summarizes our findings , and presents further directions of study .",
    "we consider diffusive particles in a one - dimensional system of size @xmath3 as described by the mft ( see  @xcite for a microscopic derivation ) .",
    "particles can be injected to  or extracted from  the system at the boundaries only .",
    "this condition is expressed by the continuity equation , @xmath4 which relates the coarse grained density @xmath5 and current density @xmath6 by using rescaled coordinates for space @xmath7 $ ] and time @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the mft states that the probability to observe a fluctuation @xmath9 can be written using only the macroscopic diffusion coefficient @xmath10 and conductivity @xmath11 , which generally depend on the local density @xmath12 . to define @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we consider a system coupled at each end to a reservoir with fixed densities @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "we take @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "the diffusion and conductivity are defined using the first two cumulant coefficients of the integrated number of particles @xmath1 ,    [ eq : two cumulants ] @xmath22    where @xmath23 stands for an averaging with respect to the steady state probability distribution , and @xmath24 .",
    "the large deviation principle assumes that the probability to observe a net transfer of @xmath1 particles is given by @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the mean constrained current and @xmath27 is the large deviation function . using the mft ,",
    "@xmath27 is expressed as a minimization problem  @xcite .",
    "obtaining @xmath27 explicitly requires finding an optimal fluctuation @xmath9 that satisfies eq .   and the mean constrained current @xmath28 .",
    "another useful representation of current statistics is obtained from the cumulant generating function @xmath29 . here , the two previous constraints are relaxed , and the mean constrained current @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath30 , and a lagrange multiplier @xmath31 is introduced to account for the continuity equation .",
    "the cumulant generating function is the legendre transform of the large deviation function , @xmath32 .",
    "the cumulant generating function is then explicitly written as a minimization problem  @xcite , @xmath33 where   @xmath34 the trajectories @xmath35 , which solve the minimization problem , satisfy hamilton equations subjected to the boundary conditions  @xcite    [ eq : bc - notap ] @xmath36    solving this problem proves generally difficult . in  @xcite , it was conjectured ( the ap assumption ) that the optimal density profile is time - independent   to be time - independent , although it may not be necessarily so . ] . in this case",

    "clearly that trivial solution never corresponds to a dpt as it yields @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the main task of finding a numerical solution of eqs .   is to force out that trivial solution and to find nontrivial ones .",
    "we note that in  @xcite , it was necessary to develop a non - linear perturbation theory , namely , to include higher order terms , such as @xmath63 .",
    "however , it seems that the method presented in  @xcite can not be extended to find time - dependent transitions .",
    "for the models considered here , linear perturbation theory is sufficient to observe dpts .",
    "there is no direct method to systematically search for first order dpts .",
    "however , one may encounter them while solving the ap equations   with boundary conditions  .",
    "it happens when either the large deviation function @xmath64 or the cumulant generating function",
    "@xmath56 favor one solution below some critical value and a second one above it ( see appendix  [ sec : app : order - of - transition ] ) .",
    "there is no guarantee , though , that there is no third solution , which is always favorable .",
    "as for now , there is no known example of a process leading to a time - dependent second order dpt under boundary drive . note that from eq .  , one can infer a sufficient condition for the validity of the ap solution  @xcite , namely , @xmath65    several models , e.g. , the symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep )  @xcite and the zero range process  @xcite ,   satisfy eq .  , so that the ap can be used to evaluate the cumulant generating function .    here",
    "we present three models and discuss the occurrence of a dpt : ( ) a toy model with three extremal points for @xmath14 , ( ) the kmp model , and ( ) the long - range hopping with exclusion model suggested by bodineau  @xcite .",
