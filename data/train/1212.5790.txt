    "various cosmic observations suggest our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "to explain this phenomenon , people introduce an exotic component with negative pressure known as dark energy .",
    "the simplest dark energy model is cosmological constant ( @xmath7 ) @xcite or xcdm model where dark energy has an arbitrary equation of state ( eos ) @xmath8 .",
    "it fits all kinds of observational data well while it is confronted with theoretical problems such as `` coincidence '' problem and `` fine - tuning '' problem @xcite . as a result",
    ", other dark energy models have been widely proposed including quintessence @xcite , quintom @xcite , phantom @xcite , gcg @xcite and so on . in principle , dark energy is related to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "but until now , a self - consistent quantum gravity theory has not established .",
    "nevertheless , the holographic principle @xcite is thought to be a reflection of quantum gravity . motivated by this , holographic dark energy has been proposed .",
    "it embodies the relation between uv cut - off and ir cut off .",
    "however , how to choose the ir cut - off is a problem .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "@xcite first chose hubble scale as ir cut - off .",
    "hsu and li @xcite pointed out it can not give an acceleration solution .",
    "li then suggested the future event horizon as ir cut - off @xcite .",
    "basing on causality , cai proposed agegraphic dark energy @xcite and new agegraphic dark energy @xcite . furthermore , gao et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a holographic dark energy from ricci scalar curvature . in rde model ,",
    "the ir cut - off is determined by a local quantity .",
    "nowadays , all the models above seem to be consistent with current observations . usually , we estimate models through the @xmath9 or information criteria like bic and aic @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we find xcdm model and rde model can be related by a parameter @xmath0 , thus we can estimate them through constraining @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 can reflect which model is better .",
    "for example , if the best - fit value of @xmath0 is close to 1 and 0 is not within 2-@xmath10 range , we can say the observations support rde model rather than xcdm model .",
    "we now give some similar examples . in order to know whether @xmath7cdm is right , people free the eos parameter and constrain it with observations",
    ". if the result is close to -1 , we can say @xmath7cdm is still a good choice",
    ". however , if the eos parameter tends to -2 , then @xmath7cdm should be suspected .",
    "likewise , for purely dimensional reasons , granda and oliveros @xcite proposed a new ir cut - off .",
    "wang and xu @xcite give the constraint results which suggest the coefficient of @xmath11 is two times larger than the one of @xmath12 , thus ruling out the srde model @xcite .",
    "in rde model , the density of dark energy is proportional to ricci scalar or the sum of traces of energy - momentum tensors of each component .",
    "since the trace of radiation is 0 , we can ignore its impact on space - time curvature .",
    "rde model suggests the weights of dark energy and matter are the same , while xcdm model suggests only the trace of dark energy can affect its density .",
    "therefore , what on earth is the weight of matter ( 0.5 or 0 ? ) is an interesting thing we want to know .",
    "motivated by this , we free the weight of matter as an arbitrary parameter called weight factor .    the rest of the letter is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the dynamics of the new generalized ricci dark energy model . in section 3",
    ", we give a statefinder diagnostic . in section 4",
    ", we introduce the observational data we use .",
    "the constraint results are shown in section 5 .",
    "at last , we give the discussion and conclusion in section 6 . throughout the letter ,",
    "the unit with light velocity @xmath13 is used .",
    "we assume the universe is flat and described by friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric . for rde model ,",
    "the density of dark energy is proportional to ricci scalar @xmath15      from this equation , the coefficients of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are both 1 , which means the weights of dark energy and matter are the same .",
    "we now change the weight of matter , the equation becomes @xmath20 @xmath0 here is the weight factor we introduce which reflects the relative weight of matter to dark energy .",
    "if @xmath1 , it becomes the usual rde model .",
    "when @xmath2 @xmath21 equivalently , @xmath22 the ngr model becomes xcdm model . for simplicity , we define dimensionless quantities @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "@xmath26 is hubble parameter , subscript `` 0 '' represents the quantity today .",
    "the friedmann equation can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "the energy - momentum conservation equation can be expressed as @xmath29 subscript `` i '' represents dark energy or matter",
    ". then we get @xmath30 where @xmath31 . with the initial condition @xmath32",
    "we can obtain the evolution of @xmath33 with respect to redshift z @xmath34      in order to exhibit the effects of @xmath0 , we fix @xmath37 and @xmath38 and plot the evolutions of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , hubble parameter @xmath41 and density parameters defined as @xmath42 in fig .
