    "during the last decade , a considerable attention has been drawn to identify the mechanisms that may induce global oscillatory behavior in excitable media @xcite .",
    "excitable media are composed of coupled excitable elements characterized by quiescent states with very large responses ( amplitude and relaxation time ) to stimuli larger than some threshold .",
    "this kind of nonlinear behavior has attracted a great interest in fields such as chemistry @xcite , and biology @xcite .",
    "oscillations in excitable media can be originated by : i ) pacemaking cells such as in the case of the heart @xcite , ii ) individual elements that oscillate when isolated , and , iii ) more recently it has been suggested that diversity amongst the elements and/or internal noise can produce oscillations that are _ emergent _ in the sense that they show up even when none of the elements oscillate when isolated .    motivated by the experimental observation of emergent synchronized oscillations in the islets of langerhans @xcite ( insulin producing structures in mammalian pancreas ) several works",
    "have been devoted to offer a sound explanation for this oscillatory behavior @xcite .",
    "cells in the islets of langerhans are of the type known as @xmath0 cells and do not oscillate when isolated @xcite . as no pacemaking cells are found in the islets of langerhans , a different mechanism has to be identified . in a recent work ,",
    "cartwright @xcite proposed that emergent synchronized oscillations may occur in a system of coupled excitable cells or elements in which half of them was silent and the other half continuously active , when taken individually .",
    "each element was described by means of a van der pol - fitzhugh- nagumo oscillator @xcite .",
    "more recently we argued @xcite that , if the system was close to threshold , oscillatory behavior could be triggered by just a few diverse elements .",
    "in addition , for large enough coupling between the network elements , oscillations may become synchronized .",
    "this proposal is particularly interesting from a biological point of view as a weak diversity is inherent to biological systems .    in our previous work we arranged excitable elements on clusters of the square lattice .",
    "such periodic two or three dimensional networks have been commonly used to describe the topology of islets of langerhans @xcite and some types of neurons @xcite .",
    "the present work is addressed to investigate the role that network topology plays in the appearance of synchronized oscillations in an excitable medium described by the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the effect of topology on synchronization of oscillators has been intensively investigated in recent years , particularly in networks having either the small - world or the scale - free property @xcite .",
    "most studies conclude that the larger the intrinsic size of the system ( quantified by the average network length , see below ) the worse the synchronization . in this work",
    "we investigate this issue on _ regular _ networks with different average path lengths .",
    "we choose clusters of the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and rings with additional links such that the degree @xmath1 ( number of nearest - neighbor connections ) equals that of the square lattice clusters ( @xmath1=4 ) .",
    "our results support the conclusion that the longer the average path length the worse the synchronization performance .",
    "in addition , they indicate that networks with a small standard deviation of the path length distribution show better synchronization .",
    "we also discuss the dynamical behavior of the coupled oscillators trying to identify the mechanisms that trigger and sustain synchronized oscillations .",

    "however , since we want to deal with ( essentially ) time - independent indicators , in the appendix we discuss the stationarity of the present system which is dictated by the relaxation times to the limit cycles of the oscillators . in order to have a genuine indication of the stationarity , in the appendix we stick to standard indicators borrowed from circular statistics .",

    "we describe the excitable medium by means of a system of coupled van der pol - fitzhugh - nagumo ( pfn ) equations @xcite , arranged on a given network .",

    "like all relaxation oscillators , pfn oscillator has a variable @xmath6 with a fast release and a variable @xmath7 with a slow accrual phase .",
    "the biological interpretation of these equations is discussed in detail in @xcite , here we briefly comment the main issues . each oscillator is assumed to represent a cell in a living system .",
    "variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to the potential across the nonlinear resistance ( cell membrane ) and the current through the supply , respectively .",
    "parameters @xmath0 and @xmath8 describe the ( membrane ) resistance and the square root of the ratio inductance / capacitance respectively , and @xmath9 is proportional to the charging potential of the cellular membrane .",
    "the strength of coupling between nearest - neighbors is denoted by @xmath10 , while the function that describes coupling @xmath11 is given by , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of nearest - neighbors ( or connectivity ) of element @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is usually referred to as the laplacian matrix , whose structure plays an essential role in determining the behavior of the network , as it contains all the information on network s topology ; for instance it has been used to investigate the stability of the synchronized state once established @xcite .    in the absence of coupling ( isolated element ) the parameter @xmath9 determines the behavior of the oscillator . if @xmath9 is outside the oscillating range ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the threshold ) , the element is in stable equilibrium .",
    "it is called an excitable element and can be either silent ( @xmath18 ) or continuously active ( @xmath19 ) . otherwise , the equilibrium is unstable ( @xmath20 ) and the element performs oscillations along the limit cycle .",
    "the threshold is given by :    @xmath21    and for the chosen set of parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , kept constant hereafter in this work , it takes the value @xmath24 .",
    "the coupled pfn equations were solved numerically on several regular networks with @xmath5 nodes , @xmath25 links and a connectivity @xmath26 for all nodes .",
    "all elements are assumed to be active with @xmath27 , but a small fraction @xmath28 of them , called impurities or diverse elements , are taken to be silent with @xmath29 , @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the numerical results discussed in this work correspond to @xmath31 . although for this parameter value no element oscillates when isolated , coupling and impurities may trigger oscillations .",
    "a simple way to visualize this effect is to write ( within a mean field approach ) the effective parameter as :    @xmath32    this clearly shows that the presence of impurities may shift the effective parameter value below the threshold , forcing an originally quiescent element to oscillate .",
    "although this expression can be used to estimate the fraction of impurities above which the oscillatory behavior emerges , it can not account for the important differences in the performance of ordinary and impurity elements that can actually show up ( see below ) .",
    "fortunately , an effective @xmath9 can be estimated separately for each element @xcite : @xmath33 at quiescence there is no coupling between elements having the same parameter value . however , in the case of one silent ( @xmath34 ) and one continuously active cell ( @xmath35 ) we can write @xmath36 .",
    "the coupling between different cells is therefore of crucial importance for the effective change of cells parameters .",
    "let us call @xmath37 the average number of the nearest - neighbors of opposite nature for ordinary ( @xmath38 ) and impurity ( @xmath39 ) cells .",

    "let us give some numbers .",
    "the critical fraction of impurities @xmath43 required to force ordinary cells to oscillate can be derived by setting @xmath44 : @xmath45 taking a typical value for the coupling strength @xmath46 and the values of the other two parameters given above , we obtain @xmath47",
    ". the effective parameter of the impurity cell for this value of @xmath28 is @xmath48 .",
    "the effect is so strong that the parameter has not only changed its sign , but it is also well outside the oscillatory regime .",
    "this result underlies the differences in the behavior of ordinary and impurity cells discussed below .",
    "we quantify the emergence of oscillatory behavior by calculating various averages and standard deviations , over a sufficiently long time interval ( see below ) , of either the fast variable @xmath6 or the phase , both for individual elements and for the network as a whole . in the literature one can find many definitions of synchronization , mainly because of the different physical meanings ( full- , phase- , delayed - synchronization , etc . )",
    "measures similar to the ones adopted here are commonly used to characterize oscillatory behavior in excitable media @xcite . in order to make the bridge with well - established circular statistics @xcite , in the appendix we evaluate the circular variance for some selected cases , drawing the same conclusions ( at least qualitatively ) of this section as far as the level of synchronization",
    "is concerned . as a byproduct",
    "we also obtain information on the stationarity of our model .",
    "as discussed elsewhere @xcite transients can be quite long for weakly cells . instead , in the case of strongly coupled cells the coherent oscillatory behavior is almost instantaneously attained ( cp .",

    "the coupled pfn equations were solved with an integration step of @xmath51 , taking averages from @xmath52 up to @xmath53 .",

    "the smaller @xmath67 the better the synchronization . the measure chosen to test synchronization in this work is more demanding than those used in previous works , in the sense that now we evaluate the differences in both dynamical variables @xcite .",

    "first we note that a characteristic oscillating pattern and coherent behavior is achieved almost instantaneously .",
    "we have checked that this is the case even if the initial conditions are varied . on the other hand no significant differences between oscillation of a particular element and of the network as a whole are noted .",
    "the coupling function @xmath143 shows an oscillatory pattern similar to that of @xmath6 , although it is an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "this shows that a small difference between variables in each element is enough to sustain synchronized oscillations .",
    "in addition the oscillatory pattern is stable : any perturbation of phase coordinates ( within the range of limit circle ) at time @xmath144 , could be viewed as setting new initial conditions starting at that time .",
    "the effect of the perturbation would then be eliminated after a few periods , restoring the characteristic pattern .",
    "the conclusions that emerge from our study of the induction of global synchronized oscillations by heterogeneity in excitable regular systems are :    \\1 .",
    "elements and network activity and synchronization , as collective phenomena , depend mainly on global properties of the network . shortening the average path length by merely changing the topology ,",

    "synchronization in clusters of the square lattice is improved by increasing the strength of coupling between the excitable elements . in the strong coupling regime",
    "most of the elements are highly activated , oscillating with the same frequencies and negligible dephasing .",
    "circular regular networks with short range links are hardly synchronized even when elements are strongly coupled , due to their long average path length and large standard deviation .",

    "finally , we have revisited the behavior of van der pol - fitzhugh - nagumo excitable media when their size is varied .",
    "we found that the dynamical behavior of the network can be kept unchanged when the system size increases , provided that the coupling strength is increased proportionally to the square of the average path length . regarding synchronization , the optimal topologies are the ones for which the average path length increases more slowly with the size of the system .",

    "decreasing the coupling strength , deteriorates synchronization . in the case of @xmath162 ,",

    "better synchronization is achieved for declustered rings , having shorter average path length , cp .",
    "the average variance is smaller , 0.4 for declustered comparing to 0.6 for clustered systems , while the transient period is shorter , @xmath167 for declustered relative to @xmath168 for clustered rings . as reasonable , from the numbers above we see that the transient time necessary to attain a stationary evolution increases when the coupling constant is decreased .    finally , as in the main text , we address the question of whether the average path length is the only topological parameter that matters . to this end",
