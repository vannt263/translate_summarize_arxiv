    "the population inversion created by injection or optical pumping in graphene layers ( gls ) and graphene bilayers ( gbls )  @xcite results in the negative dynamic conductivity in the terahertz ( thz ) range of frequencies  @xcite and enables the graphene - based thz lasers  @xcite .",
    "different research groups have demonstrated the thz gain in the pumped gls  @xcite ( see , also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . gls and gbls can serve as the active regions of the thz lasers with the fabry - perot resonators , dielectric waveguides , slot - lines including the plasmonic lasers  @xcite .",
    "the gl and gbl heterostructure lasers can operate in a wide frequency range , including the 6 to 10 thz range , where using materials like a@xmath0b@xmath1 is hindered by the optical phonon effects  @xcite .",
    "the thz lasing in gl and gbl structures is possible if the contribution of the interband radiative transitions to the real part of the dynamic conductivity @xmath2 in a certain range of frequencies surpasses the contribution of the intraband radiative processes associated with the drude losses .",
    "the interband transitions include the direct ( with the conservation of the electron momenta ) and the indirect transitions ( accompanied with the variation of the electron momentum due to scattering ) .",
    "the limitations imposed by the momentum and energy conservation laws allow only for the indirect intraband radiative transitions . in the gls and gbls with sufficiently long carrier momentum relaxation time @xmath3 ,",
    "the direct interband radiative transitions dominate over the indirect intraband transitions and @xmath4 recently  @xcite , we demonstrated that in gls and gbls with primarily long - range disorder scattering , the indirect interband transitions can prevail over the indirect intraband transitions leading to fairly large absolute values of the negative conductivity  @xmath5 .",
    "these values could exceed the fundamental limits for the direct transitions , which are @xmath6 for gls and @xmath7 for gbls  @xcite ( here @xmath8 is the electron charge and @xmath9 is the planck constant ) . as a result , in the gl and gbl structures with a long - range disorder",
    "one can expect that the condition @xmath10 could be fulfilled in a wider range of the thz frequencies , including the low boundary of the thz range .",
    "when the momentum relaxation is associated with long - range scattering mechanism , moderate values of @xmath3 might be sufficient for achieving @xmath11 , especially in gbls where the density of states ( dos ) @xmath12 as a function of energy @xmath13 near the band edges ( @xmath14 ) in the latter is considerably larger than in gls ( where @xmath15 ) .",
    "this paper deals with the gbl heterostructures with a remote impurity layer ( ril ) located at some distance from the gbl plane and incorporating donors and acceptors or donor and acceptor clusters .",
    "we consider the gbl - ril heterostructure as an active region of an injection thz laser .",
    "we show that the electron and hole injection from the side n- and p - contact regions into the gbl - ril heterostructures leads to the population inversion enabling the enhanced negative dynamic conductivity , which , in turn , can result in lasing in the thz range .",
    "figure  1 shows the schematic view of an injection laser based on the gbl - ril heterostructure at the reverse bias voltage @xmath16 .",
    "the remote ( selective ) doping can markedly affect the scattering of electrons and holes ( see , for example  @xcite ) and , hence , the indirect radiative transitions .",
    "the gl and gbl heterostructures using remote doping were already fabricated and used for device applications  @xcite .",
    "the heterostructures with the selectively doped gbl and ril demonstrate the following distinct features .",
    "first , the net electron and hole densities determined by both the pumping and ril and the electron and hole quasi - fermi energies , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are generally not equal .",
    "second , relatively large scale of the donor and acceptor density fluctuations result in smooth ( long - range ) spatial variations of the potential in the gbl created by the ril , separated by distance @xmath19 from the gbl .",
    "this could result in the electron and hole scattering with a relatively small momentum change and , consequently , increase in the contribution of the indirect interband transitions in comparison with the interaband transitions .",
    "thus , the main role of the ril is not to induce extra carrier in the gbl ( as in high - electron mobility transistors ) but to provide the specific mechanism of the electron and hole scattering reinforcing the indirect interband radiative transitions .",
    "we calculate the spectral characteristics of real part of the dynamic conductivity @xmath2 in the pumped gbl - ril heterostructures as a functions of the doping level and the spacer thickness @xmath19 and compare the obtained characteristics with those of the undoped heterostructures .",
    "this analysis reveals the conditions for the selective doping enabling the negative dynamic conductivity in a wide frequency range , including the frequencies of a few thz .",
    "this might open new prospects of gbl heterostructures for the efficient thz lasers based on the gbl heterostructures .",
    "we study the gbl - ril heterostructures pumped via the injection from the side p- and n- contacts shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in the very clean pumped gbls ( or gls ) with a fairly high carrier mobility the intraband ( drude absorption ) at the radiation frequencies above one thz should not play a dominant role .",
    "hence , adding the selective doping might not be needed .",
    "however , in the gbls with a relatively low carrier mobility caused by unavoidable ( residual ) charge impurities and imperfections , the ril induced scattering could result in a substantial compensation of the drude absorption and , therefore , enhancement of the negative dynamic conductivity in the following , for definiteness , we consider the gbl - ril heterostructures with the gbl doped with acceptors ( with the density @xmath20 ) and the ril formed by partially compensated donors ( with the density @xmath21 ) and acceptors ( with the density @xmath22 ) .",
    "hence @xmath23 .",
    "we further assume that in these heterostructures , the ril might comprise the clusterized acceptors and donors ( with the correlated charge defects forming the charged clusters with the charge @xmath24 and the characteristic size @xmath25 , where @xmath8 is the electron charge ) . in the latter case ,",
    "we assume that the cluster density is equal to @xmath26 . such gbl - ril heterostructures are quasi - neutral even in the absence of the pumping .",
    "pumping results in the formation in the gbl of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron and hole gases with the equal densities @xmath27 and the quasi - fermi energies @xmath28 .",
    "figure  2 shows the gbl band diagram under pumping . in fig .  2 ,",
    "the arrows indicate different radiative transitions : vertical interband transitions , indirect intraband transitions accompanied by the electron scattering on the impurities , phonons , and holes ( leading to the drude absorption of radiation ) , and the interband indirect transitions .",
    "the transverse electric field arising in the spacer due to the features of the doping can lead to the local opening of the energy gap  @xcite .",
    "however , as shown below , for the doping levels under consideration , the energy gap expected to be small , and the band opening and and the energy spectrum nonparabolicity will be disregarded  @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum is assumed to be @xmath29 ,  @xcite , where @xmath30  ev is the inter - gl overlap integral in gbls , @xmath31  cm / s is the characteristic velocity , and @xmath32 is the effective mass of electrons and holes .",
    "the real part of the net dynamic ( thz ) conductivity in the in - plane direction , @xmath2 , of gls and gbls comprises the contributions from the direct ( vertical ) , @xmath33 , and two types of the indirect , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , transitions , respectively :    @xmath36    the first term in eq .",

    "( 1 ) corresponds to the processes responsible the drude absorption .",
