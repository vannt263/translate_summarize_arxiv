    "the relativistic length contraction ( lc ) and time dilatation ( td ) effects were pointed out as consequences of the space - time lorentz transformation ( lt ) in einstein s original paper  @xcite on special relativity ( sr ) .",
    "the lc effect was clearly stated to be an ` apparent ' one in reference  @xcite ; even so , in many text books on sr it is stated to be not only an , in principle , experimentally observable effect but also a ` real ' one implying that there is actually some dynamical contraction of the body , as discussed for example , in references  @xcite .",
    "it was only on making a more careful analysis of the physics of the observation process that it was realised , some five decades after einstein s original paper , that the length contracted sphere that he considered would appear to be , to a distant observer , not flattened into an ellipsoid , but simply rotated  @xcite .",
    "this is because ` observation ' actually means the detection of photons emitted by , or scattered from , the observed object .",
    "not only the lc effect but also the the effects of light propagation time delays of the observed photons and optical aberration ( that is , the change in the direction of motion of a photon due to the lt of its momentum ) must also be properly accounted for . in the present paper it is assumed throughout that all observations are corrected for the last two effects , so that the apparent positions are predicted by the lt only .    in a recent paper by the present author",
    "@xcite it was noticed that the lc effect itself is closely akin to the effect of light propagation time delays . in the latter , in order to arrive at the observer _ at the same time _",
    "( this is the definition of the observation that gives lc ) the photons coming from parts of the viewed object at different distances along the line of sight must be emitted from the object at different times .",
    "similarly , because of the ` relativity of simultaneity ' proposed by einstein , the photons recorded by the stationary observer at a fixed time must be emitted , in the rest frame of the moving object , at different times from different positions along the direction of motion of the object .",
    "thus lc is a strict consequence of the relativity of simultaneity . in the same paper  @xcite two other apparent distortions of space - time due to the lt : space dilatation ( sd )",
    "in which the moving object appears longer ( not shorter as in lc ) and time contraction ( tc ) in which which the moving equivalent clock viewed at a fixed position in the observer s frame appears to be running faster ( not slower as in td ) than an identical stationary clock , were pointed out .",
    "the four effects lc , td , sd and tc are all related to the projective geometry of the lt equations , and correspond to the projections with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    ", @xmath4 ; @xmath5 , @xmath6 are measured in two inertial frames , s ; s in relative motion along their common @xmath7-axis ] the ` apparent ' nature of all the effects is then manifest since a moving object can not be ` really ' contracted in , for example , the lc effect , if , with a different observation procedure ( sd ) it appears to be elongated .",
    "a similar consideration applies to the ( opposite ) td and tc effects .    in an even more recent paper  @xcite the relation between the ` real ' positions of moving",
    "objects ( i.e. those defined , for different objects , in a common reference frame ) to the apparent positions predicted by the lt was considered in detail . in particular ,",
    "the well known ` rockets - and - string '  @xcite and ` pole - and - barn '  @xcite paradoxes were re - discussed and a procedure for measuring the real positions of moving objects in a single reference frame was proposed .",
    "the present paper pursues further the relation between the real and apparent positions of moving objects as well as analysing the times registered by two , spatially separated , synchronised , moving clocks viewed by a stationary observer .",
    "it is noted that , due to the ambiguity in the choice of the origin of spatial coordinates in the rest frame of the moving objects or clocks , no definite predictions are obtained for either the times recorded by , or the apparent positions of , the moving clocks , but that , in every case , there is a violation of translational invariance . only if a _",
    "lt is used , in which the origin of spatial coordinates in the rest frame of the moving object coincides with the spatial coordinate of the transformed event , is translational invariance found to be respected . in this case there is no ` relativity of simultaneity ' and the related lc , tc and sd effects do not occur . however , td , that results from a local lt , is unaffected by the restriction to this type of transformation .",
    "it is shown in section 8 below that , in fact , td is the only relativistic space - time effect that is confirmed experimentally .",
    "only time intervals , not space intervals , are modified by a local lt , thus breaking , in this case , the space - time exchange symmetry recently proposed as a mathematical basis for sr  @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in the following section the discussion of the distinction between the ` real ' and ` apparent ' positions of moving objects first given in  @xcite is repeated , as this concept is important for the arguments presented later in the paper ; indeed , for a local lt there is no distinction between ` real ' and ` apparent ' positions . in section 3",
    "translational invariance is discussed in a general way in connection with the observation of two identical and similarly accelerated clocks . in section 4 the observation of the times of clocks subjected to a similar , constant , acceleration in their proper frames",
    "is discussed for local and non - local lts . in section 5",
    "the real and apparent positions of the moving clocks are discussed in relation to the lc effect . in section 6 ,",
    "the principle of ` source signal contiguity ' is proposed and some causal paradoxes of sr are resolved by use of the local lt . in section 7",
    "the minkowski space - time plot is considered and relativistic kinematics is discussed .",
    "section 8 contains an analysis of the michelson - morley experiment considered as a ` photon clock ' .",
    "a concise review of the experimental tests of sr performed to date is presented in section 9 . in section",
    "10 two different satellite - borne experiments are proposed .",
    "the first , an extension of a previously performed cesium clock experiment , is a proposal to observe tc .",
    "this is an o(@xmath8 ) effect . where @xmath9 is the relative velocity of the satellite and ground - based observer at the time of the experiment . ]",
    "the second experiment proposes a ` photon clock ' similar to the longitudinal arm of a michelson interferometer , constituted by two satellites following the same orbit close to the surface of the earth , to measure directly the ` relativity of simultaneity ' ( rs ) effect .",
    "as the relativistic effects are here of o(@xmath10 ) less precise time measurements are sufficient to test the predictions in this case .",
    "the ` real ' positions of one or more moving objects are defined here as those specified , or measured , in a single frame of reference .",
    "the latter may be either inertial , or with an arbitary accelerated motion . by introducing the concept of a co - moving inertial frame , at any instant of the accelerated motion",
    ", the distance between the objects can always be defined as the proper distance between them in a certain inertial frame .",
    "if this distance in the different co - moving inertial frames is constant the ` real ' distance is said to be constant .",
    "no distinction is made between the real distance between the points on a rigid extended object and that between discrete , physically separated , objects coincident in space - time with these points .",
    "this is because the lt , that relates only space - time events in different inertial frames , treats , in an identical manner , points on extended or discrete physical objects .",
    "the utility of the science of the ` real ' positions of moving objects ( astronomy , railways , military ballistics , air traffic control , space travel , gps satellites ... ) is evident and the validity of the basic physical concepts introduced by galileo ( distance , time , velocity and acceleration ) are not affected , in any way , by sr .",
    "the ` real ' positions of objects in a given reference frame are those which must be known to , for example , avoid collisions between moving objects in the case of railway networks , or , on the contrary , to assure them in the case of military ballistics or space - travel . from now on , in this paper ,",
    "the words ` real ' and ` apparent ' will be written without quotation marks .    for clarity , a definite measuring procedure to establish the real distance between two moving objects in a given frame of observation",
    "is introduced .",
    "suppose that the objects considered move along the positive x - axis of an inertial coordinate system s. the co - moving inertial frame of the objects is denoted by s. it is imagined that two parallel light beams cross the x - axis in s , at right angles , at a distance @xmath11 apart .",
    "each light beam is viewed by a photo - cell and the moving objects are equipped with small opaque screens that block the light beams during the passage of the objects .",
    "two objects , o1 and o2 , with x(o2 ) @xmath12 x(o1 ) , moving with the same uniform velocity , @xmath9 , will then interrupt , in turn , each of the light beams .",
    "suppose that the photo - cells in the forward ( f ) and backward ( b ) beams are equipped with clocks that measure the times of extinction of the beams to be ( in an obvious notation ) @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "consideration of the motion of the objects past the beams gives the following equations ; @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the real distance between the moving objects .",
    "eqns(2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) give the times of passage of the objects o1 and o2 , respectively , between the light beams , whereas eqn(2.3 ) is obtained by noting that , if @xmath19 , each object moves the distance @xmath20 during the interval @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 each object moves a distance @xmath23 during the interval @xmath24 and the same equation is obtained .",
    "taking the ratios of eqn(2.3 ) to either eqn(2.1 ) or eqn(2.2 ) yields , after some simple algebra , the relations : @xmath25}{t(b1)-t(f1 ) } \\\\",
    "l   & = & \\ell \\frac{[t(f1)-t(f2)]}{t(b2)-t(f2 ) }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subtracting eqn(2.3 ) from eqs(2.1 ) or ( 2.2 ) , respectively , gives : @xmath26 taking the ratios of eqn(2.6 ) to ( 2.2 ) and eqn(2.7 ) to ( 2.1 ) then yields two further equations , similar to ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) above : @xmath25}{t(b2)-t(f2 ) } \\\\",
    "l   & = & \\ell \\frac{[t(f1)-t(f2)]}{t(b1)-t(f1 ) }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( 2.4),(2.5),(2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ) show that any three of the four time measurements are sufficient to determine the real separation , @xmath18 , between the two moving objects . in these equations the times : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 and @xmath16 , respectively , are not used to determine @xmath18 . in order to combine all four time measurements to obtain the best , unbiased , determinations of @xmath9 and @xmath18 , eqns(2.1 ) and ( 2.2 )",
    "may be added to obtain : @xmath27 while subtracting two times eqn(2.3 ) from ( 2.10 ) gives : @xmath28 the velocity , @xmath9 , is obtained by transposing eqn(2.10 ) : @xmath29 while the ratio of eqn(2.11 ) to ( 2.10 ) gives : @xmath30}{t(b1)+t(b2)-t(f1)-t(f2)}\\ ] ]    it is interesting to note that the real spatial positions , as well as the instantaneous velocity and acceleration , at any time , of two objects subjected to a symmetric , uniform , acceleration in the frame s , can also be determined from the four time measurements just considered . in this case",
    "there is no redundancy ; the time measurements determine four equations which may be solved for the four quantites just mentioned . in the case of uniform motion",
    ", the constant velocity hypothesis may be checked by comparing the independent determinations of @xmath9 provided by eqns(2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , as already mentioned , any three of the four time measurements is sufficient to determine @xmath18 . evidently , if @xmath31 , then @xmath32 in the case of an arbitary accelerated motion of the two objects .",
    "thus , by varying @xmath11 , the real distance between the co - moving objects can be determined even if the acceleration program of their co - moving frame is not known .    the two objects , moving with equal and constant velocities along the x - axis in s , discussed above , are now considered to be set in motion by applying identical acceleration programs to two objects initially at rest and lying along the @xmath7-axis in s. the two objects considered are then , by definition , subjected to the same acceleration program in their common rest frame , or , what is the same thing , their common rest frame , ( with respect to which the two objects are , at all times , at rest ) is accelerated . under these circumstances",
    "the distance between the objects remains constant in the instantaneous co - moving inertial frame of the objects . at the start of the acceleration procedure ,",
    "the instantaneous co - moving inertial frame is s , at the end of the acceleration procedure it is s. therefore the separation of the objects in s at the start of the acceleration procedure is the same as that in s at the end of it . note that there is no distinction between the real and apparent separations for objects at rest in the same inertial frame",
    ". also ` relativity of simultaneity ' can play no role , since the proper time of both objects is always referred to the same co - moving inertial frame . since the acceleration program of both objects starts at the same time in s , and both objects execute identical space time trajectories , the real separation of the objects must also remain constant .",
    "this necessarily follows from space - time geometry .",
    "similarly , since the acceleration program stops at the same time in s for both objects the real separation of the objects remains constant in this frame and equal to the original separation of the objects in s. this behaviour occurs for any symmetric acceleration program , and is shown , for the special case of a constant acceleration in the rest frame of the objects ( to be calculated in detail below ) , in fig 1 . since , in the above discussion , both objects are always referred to the same inertial frame there is no way that sr can enter into the discussion and change any of the above conclusions .",
    "indeed , sr is necessary to derive the correct form of the separate space - time trajectories in s , but the symmetry properties that guarantee the equalites of the real separations of the objects can not be affected , in any way , by sr effects .",
    "two objects , o1 and o2 , originally lying at rest along the x - axis in s and separated by a distance @xmath18 are now simultaneously accelerated , during a fixed time period , @xmath33 , in s , starting at @xmath34 , with constant acceleration , @xmath35 , in their common proper frame , up to a relativistic velocity @xmath36 corresponding to @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the equations giving the velocity @xmath9 and the position @xmath7 in a fixed inertial frame , using such an acceleration program , were derived by marder  @xcite and more recently by nikolic  @xcite and rindler  @xcite .",
    "the positions and velocities of the objects in the frame s are : for @xmath39 @xmath40 for @xmath41 @xmath42-\\frac{l}{2 } \\\\",
    "x_2(t ) & = & c\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{c^2+a^2t^2}-c}{a}\\right]+\\frac{l}{2 }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath43 @xmath44    the origins of s and s have been chosen to coincide at @xmath45 .",
    "the real positions of the objects in s are shown , as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , in fig.1 .",
    "the velocities of the two objects are equal at all times , as is also the real separation of the objects @xmath48 .",
    "sr is used only to derive eqn(2.17 ) . the time - varying velocity is then integrated according to the usual rules of classical dynamics in order to obtain eqns(2.18),(2.19 ) for the positions of the objects during acceleration",
    "these are , by definition , the _ real _ positions of the objects o1 and o2 in s. the equalities of the velocities and the constant real separations are a direct consequence of the assumed initial conditions and the similarity of the proper frame accelerations of the objects .",
    "these are the sets of equations that must be used to specify the distance between o1 and o2 and any other objects whose real positions are specified in s , in order to predict collisions or other space - time interactions of the objects .",
    "in the following , in order to investigate the properties of the space - time lt , it will be found convenient to consider two identical clocks , a and b , which perform identical motion parallel to the x - axis of a ` stationary ' inertial frame s. the common co - moving frame , at any instant , of a and b , is denoted by s. initially , a and b , which have each been synchronised with a reference clock , c , at rest in the frame s , are at rest in s , separated by a distance , @xmath18 ( see fig.2a ) . at time @xmath34 each clock is subjected to an identical acceleration program during the time @xmath33 in s. because the velocities of a and b are the same at any instant then , as discussed in the previous section , a common co - moving inertial frame always exists for the two clocks . as also discussed in the previous section , their separation , as measured in this co - moving frame , or in the frame",
    "s , remains @xmath18 at all times . because of relativistic effects",
    ", that will be calculated in the following section for a specific acceleration program , the observed time in s , @xmath6 , registered by the moving clocks a and b will differ from that shown by the reference clock c that is at rest in s. however , the times indicated by a and b must be identical .",
    "this is a consequence of translational invariance .",
    "the relativistic effects of the acceleration program must be the same whether they are applied to a clock initally at rest at position @xmath7 or one initially at rest at position @xmath49 .",
    "after the time @xmath33 , the acceleration of each clock ceases and they continue to move with the same constant relativistic velocity @xmath50 , separated by the distance @xmath18 , as shown in fig2b .",
    "it is now assumed that the clocks a and b , introduced above , initially at rest in s , are subjected to the same uniform acceleration , @xmath35 , in their own rest frames , at the same instant in s , in the direction of the positive x - axis , for a time , in s , of duration @xmath33 .",
    "this is exactly the same acceleration program as that discussed for the objects o1 and o2 in section 2 above .",
    "the formulae giving the relativistic velocity , @xmath51 , and position , @xmath52 , in the frame s as a function of the elapsed time , @xmath4 , in this frame are , as in ( 2.17 ) and ( 2.18 ) above : @xmath53    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in this case , the clock is situated at the origin of s at @xmath34 .",
    "the observed time , @xmath6 , indicated by the clocks in s , as a function of @xmath4 is calculated by integrating the differential form of the lt of time in accordance with the time variation of @xmath10 given by eqn(4.1 ) . in the first case a _ local _",
    "lt is used for each clock .",
    "this corresponds to the choice @xmath54 in the general space - time lt : @xmath55 that is , the origin of coordinates in s is chosen to be at the position of the transformed space point ( the position of the clock a or b ) .",
    "non - local _ lt is one in which the origin of coordinates in s is not at the same position as the transformed space point .",
    "there are clearly an infinite number of such lt equations for any transformed space point , corresponding to an arbitary choice of origin in s. situating clock a at @xmath56 , the differential form of ( 4.6 ) corresponding to eqn(4.1 ) is : @xmath57 where : @xmath58 or , using eqn(4.1 ) , @xmath59 performing the integral over t gives : @xmath60 @xmath61 for @xmath43 eqn(4.7 ) simplifies to : @xmath62 so that for @xmath63 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is given by eqn(4.9 ) .",
    "an identical result is , of course , given by a local lt for clock b. thus , in this case , translational invariance , as depicted in fig.1a , is evidently respected .    a non - local lt is now used to evaluate @xmath6 for the clock b. the origin of the lt in s is chosen at the position of the clock a. the value of @xmath6 for a , @xmath66 , is then given by eqns(4.9),(4.11 ) .",
    "now the position of b correponds to a non - local lt with @xmath67 . in this case",
    ", the differential form of ( 4.6 ) gives , instead of ( 4.8 ) , the expression : @xmath68 and , on integrating over @xmath4 : @xmath69 @xmath70 that is : @xmath71 since , for the local lt with @xmath72 for both a and b : @xmath73 it follows that : @xmath74 evidently @xmath66 and @xmath75 are different , and so translational invariance is not respected if @xmath76 , i.e. if the lt applied to the clock b is non - local .    alternatively , choosing the origin in s of the lt for clock a to coincide with the position of b ( @xmath77 ) or to lie midway between the two clocks ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) gives the results , valid in the interval @xmath80 : @xmath81 the times registered by the clocks a and b , as viewed from s , at time @xmath82 , are shown , for the different choices of the origin in s of the lt considered above , in fig.3 .",
    "units are chosen such that @xmath83 . also @xmath84 and @xmath85 ,",
    "so that @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the time interval @xmath88 corresponds to a @xmath89 rotation of the hands of the clocks a and b , while @xmath87 corresponds to a @xmath90 rotation of the hand of c. the time shift between clocks a and b depends only on the final velocity and the spatial sparation of the clocks it is independent of the acceleration @xmath35 . the same shift therefore occurs for instantaneous acceleration into the frame s from s , as often considered in idealised space - time thought experiments .    since the procedure described for accelerating the clocks is physically well defined and unique , the times indicated by the clocks a and b must also be unique , so at most one of the four cases shown in fig.3 can be physically correct .",
    "since it has been argued in section 3 above that translational invariance requires that the clocks a and b indicate always the _ same _ time , the only possibility is that shown in fig.3a , corresponding to a local lt for each clock .",
    "the non - local lt used in figs.4b , c , d must then be unphysical . in each of these cases where events contiguous in space - time with one clock,(fig . 3b and 3c ) or both clocks,(fig .",
    "3d ) are subjected to a non - local lt , it can be seen that clock a is apparently in advance of clock b by the fixed time interval @xmath91 .",
    "this is just the apparent effect of ` relativity of simultaneity ' resulting from the different spatial positions of the clocks introduced in einstein s first paper on sr  @xcite .",
    "it results from the term @xmath92 in eqn(4.6 ) .",
    "the argument just presented shows that the physical existence of such an effect is in contradiction with translational invariance .",
    "it must then be concluded that , if translational invariance is respected , a non - local space - time lt is unphysical and that ` relativity of simultaneity ' does not exist . since lc is a direct consequence of the relativity of simultaneity  @xcite it",
    "also can not exist if translational invariance is respected .",
    "the lc effect is further discussed in the following section .    it may be noted that in all cases shown in fig.3 , the formula ( 4.11 ) is valid , on substituting the appropriate value of @xmath93 . if @xmath94 it then follows , independently of the choice of a local or non - local lt , or of the position of the origin of the latter in s , that : @xmath95 thus the rate , as observed in s , of both clocks a and b , after acceleration , is slowed down in accordance with the well known time dilatation ( td ) effect , although the actual times recorded by the clocks do depend on the choice of the s origin for the non - local lt . indeed , as shown in fig.3c , for the choice @xmath96 , the clock a is apparently _ in advance _ of the stationary clock c at the end of the acceleration period . the td effect for uniformly moving clocks",
    "is given by the @xmath1 projection of the lt  @xcite and , as shown in section 5 below , is defined as the result of successive _ local _ lts performed on the moving clock .",
    "thus the experimentally confirmed td effect is perfectly compatible with translational invariance .",
    "it is important for the calculation of @xmath97 that the clocks a , b , c be properly synchronised at time @xmath98 when they are at rest ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "as discussed at length in reference  @xcite the problem of synchronisation of clocks , situated at different spatial positions , is a non - trivial one .",
    "in fact in reference  @xcite the ` relativity of simultaneity ' was derived by comparing the synchronisation of clocks in a stationary and a moving frame .",
    "however , it is not necessary to discuss clock synchronisation to understand that the physical situation depicted in fig3a is the only possible one . for this",
    "it is convenient to introduce ` radioactive clocks ' which need no synchronisation . if the clocks a , b and c consist of similar samples of radioactive nuclei , equipped with a detector , then the proper time @xmath6 is determined by the number of radioactive decays , @xmath99 , recorded . in the limit that @xmath100 : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the number of unstable nuclei at time @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the mean life of the radioactive nucleus and @xmath105 is the efficiency of detection . allowing for the statistical accuracy in the determination of @xmath6 due to the finite value of @xmath99 ,",
    "it is clear that two such clocks , initially situated at different spatial positions and then subjected to identical acceleration programs , must record equal values of @xmath6 at at any time @xmath4 in s. thus figs.3b , c , d clearly correspond to physically impossible situations .",
    "in order to discuss the lc effect it will be convenient to consider the positions of the clocks a and b , introduced above , for @xmath106 . both clocks then move with their final constant relativistic velocity @xmath107 .",
    "the real separation of the clocks , in both s and s , is @xmath18 , as a consequence of the identical acceleration program to which they were subjected . as in the case of the calculation of @xmath97 discussed in the previous section , different lt , both local and non - local ,",
    "will be used to calculate the apparent positions of the clocks in s and the clock synchronisation between s and s will be performed during the phase of uniform motion following acceleration .    the first case considered is same as an early discussion of the lc effect by einstein  @xcite , and is similar to the presentation of lc given in most text books on sr .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system in s is chosen to coincide , at some instant when the clocks are synchronised so that @xmath45 , with that of s , which is located at the position of clock a. applying the lt eqn(4.3 ) then gives @xmath108 at this time , i.e. the apparent position , according to the local lt at the clock a is the same as the real position of clock a at @xmath34 .",
    "the lt ( 4.3 ) , with the above choice of clock synchronisation , is now applied to the clock b. this non - local lt with @xmath109 gives , for the apparent position of b , @xmath110 .",
    "thus , the apparent position of b , according to the lt , is shifted from the actual position , @xmath111 of b at @xmath103 .",
    "the distance between the apparent positions of a and b is : @xmath112 , the well - known lc effect .",
    "the results of repeating this type of calculation , with different choices of the origin in s , but always synchronising the clocks so that @xmath113 when the origins of s and s coincide , are presented in table 1 and shown in fig.4 .",
    "fig.4a shows the real positions of the clocks in either s at @xmath34 or s. in fig.4b - f the apparent positions of the clocks according to the lt , as observed in s at @xmath34 , are shown for different choices of the origin o of the lt . in fig.4b",
    ", corresponding to einstein s calculation of reference  @xcite the lt is local for a but not for b , in fig.4c it is local for b but non - local for a. in figs.4d , e it is non - local for both clocks .",
    "finally , in fig.4f it is local for both clocks .",
    "since , as shown in the previous section , only the case shown in fig.4f is consistent with translational invariance of @xmath97 this is the only physically possible solution .",
    "in can be seen that , in this case , the real and apparent positions of the clocks are the same and there is no lc effect .",
    "in fact , it is assumed that the local lt are performed for _ all points _ of the spatially extended clocks a and b. thus the apparent sizes of the clocks are the same in s and s ( see fig.4f ) . if a fixed origin is chosen in s for the lt of events contiguous in s with the clocks , as in figs.4b - e , the clocks are apparently contracted , parallel to their direction of motion , by the factor @xmath114 .",
    "indeed it is clear by an even more basic requirement of a physical theory , that it gives _ some _ well defined prediction , that the lc can not be even an apparent physical phenomenon .",
    "there are an infinite number of different predictions for the apparent positions of the moving clocks , in all of which they are separated by the ` lorentz - contracted ' distance @xmath115 , differing only by the arbitary choice of the position of the origin , o , of the non - local lt .",
    "in fact the apparent position of , say , @xmath116 , can be _ anywhere _ on the x - axis with a suitable choice of o. as can be seen from the fourth row of table 1 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , for any @xmath119 , by choosing @xmath120 .",
    "the problem here can be formulated in terms of a general principle that should be obeyed by any acceptable physical theory .",
    "it might be called cipp for ` coordinate independence of physical predictions ' and is equivalent to translational invariance :      it is shown clearly in fig.4 that this principle is not respected by a non - local lt . since , for a local lt the arbitariness in the choice of the origin of coordinates is , by definition , absent , cipp is not applicable and unique predictions for the observed space - time positions of events in s are always obtained .",
    "._apparent positions and times of clocks a and b at @xmath34 for different choices of origin in s. in all cases the clocks in s and s are synchronised at @xmath121 when the origins of s and s are coincident . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the delay - dependent terms are identical , at o(@xmath10 ) , to those of the calculation using non - local lt in ( 10.6 ) . in the absence of these terms",
    "it is found that @xmath122 whereas from ( 10.6 ) @xmath123 . substituting @xmath124 km and @xmath125 as for the navex spacelab experiment gives @xmath126ns , a time difference easily measureable in a single experiment .",
    "thus a clear and unambigous discrimination between the predictions of local and non - local lt can be made in this way .",
    "the delay - time dependent terms in ( 10.6 ) and(10.14 ) are : @xmath127 the contribution of the second term is quite negligible . for @xmath128 and @xmath125 , even for delays as long as 1@xmath129s ( 300 light - metres ) , it amounts only to 0.05ns .",
    "thus knowledge of @xmath130 to within a few ns is adequate to establish the expected difference in the predictions of local and non - local lt , which may be compared with the time resolution for caesium clock signals of a few ps obtained in sen .    the second term in ( 10.15 ) also enables the systematic uncertainty due to imprecise knowledge of the time of culmination to be estimated . for sen the standard deviation of twelve culmination times",
    "@xcite is 26ns .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty in @xmath131 given by ( 10.15 ) is then @xmath132ns for @xmath133 and @xmath134 , as compared to a predicted value of @xmath126ns",
    ".    the parameters of the experiment have been chosen to simplify the analysis as much as possible .",
    "however only small modifications are needed to describe more general experimental configurations .",
    "for example , the ground station c was located at : ( @xmath135 ) = ( @xmath136 ) . if it is located instead at ( @xmath137 )",
    "all the above equations are valid with the replacement @xmath138 .",
    "earlier or later times for the signal sequence @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 are taken into account by a suitable choice of the parameters @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "in fact during the time @xmath144 of passage of the light signals between the satellites , the latter move , in the frame s@xmath145 , by only a distance @xmath146 m with the above parameter choice .",
    "the propagation distance of the three signals from the satellites to c is thus essentially constant for positions near to culmination of o@xmath145.    the experiment just proposed is an actual physical realisatation of the clock synchronisation procedure proposed in einstein s first paper on special relativity  @xcite .",
    "however , unlike in the case of the test of tc in the first experiment discussed above , no actual clock synchronisation is necessary .",
    "the observer at the ground station simply measures the arrival times of @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , constructs @xmath147 and @xmath148 and compares them .",
    "however , if synchronised clocks are available at a and b the ` photon clock ' part of the experiment is unnecessary .",
    "a sends signals to c at @xmath149 and @xmath144 , b a signal at @xmath150 .",
    "the predictions for the arrival times of these signals at c are the same as those for the photon clock experiment just described , with all time delays set to zero .",
    "indeed if the clocks have been previously synchronised using einstein s light signal procedure the relativistic interpretation of the two experiments is identical . in one",
    "the synchronistion is performed in ` real time ' , in the other not .",
    "the avaliability of synchronised clocks at a and b enables an even simpler test of the relativity of simultaneity to be made .",
    "if signals @xmath151 and @xmath140 are sent at the same time @xmath152 by the two satellites , the non - local lt ( 4.5 ) and ( 4.6 ) predict space - time coordinates in s@xmath145 of : @xmath153 , @xmath154 for the emission of @xmath151 and @xmath155 , @xmath156 for the emission of @xmath140 . hence it is predicted that @xmath140 will arrive at c with time delay of @xmath157 relative @xmath151 .",
    "use of local lt at a and b give instead the predictions @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , @xmath159 for the emission of @xmath151 and @xmath140 respectively , so that the two signals arrive simultaneously at c. with the same values of @xmath18 and @xmath10 as assumed above , a difference of 16.5ns in the arrival times of the signals is predicted by the non - local lt .",
    "in fact this last experiment is an actual physical realisation , for a non - local lt , of the ` space dilatation ' ( sd ) effect proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the distance in s@xmath145 between the signal emission events predicted by a non - local lt is @xmath161 , as compared to @xmath18 for local lts .",
    "the difference is only an o(@xmath8 ) effect that , as discussed above for the lc effect of similar relative magnitude , is very difficult to measure .",
    "however , the associated time difference is an o(@xmath10 ) effect that is large enough to to be easily measurable with modern techniques .",
    "it may be at first sight surprising that special relativity can be tested by the observation of o(@xmath10 ) effects .",
    "both the experimentally confirmed td and the well - known but untested lc effects are of o(@xmath8 ) .",
    "it is important to notice , in this connection , that , as already mentioned in section 5 above , the non - local lt of time ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.6 ) do not differ from the correponding galilean transformations only by terms of o(@xmath8 ) .",
    "it is the second , space - dependent , o(@xmath10 ) terms in these equations that are responsible for the different predicted values of @xmath162 and @xmath163 in the experiment described above .",
    "it is just these terms , which are non - vanishing only for a non - local lt , that are responsible for ` relativity of simultaneity ' and the associated o(@xmath8 ) lc , sd and tc effects .",
    "conversely , the td effect is , by definition , given by a local lt .",
    "although , as discussed above , direct experimental confirmation , or the contrary , of the o(@xmath8 ) lc and sd effects , seems difficult , both the tc effect , of similar magnitude , but opposite sign to the experimentally confirmed o(@xmath8 ) td effect , and direct o(@xmath10 ) ` relativity of simultaneity ' can indeed both be easily tested by the experiments proposed above .",
    "a variation of the second experiment in which the satellites a and b are replaced by gps satellites , and the ground station c by a gps signal detector on a satellite in low earth orbit , is described in reference  @xcite . in this case , a very large value of @xmath162 of 3.2@xmath129sec is predicted .",
    "i thank y.bernard for valuable help in the preparation of the figures .",
    "i would also like to especially thank y.keilman for pointing out a calculational error ( now corrected ) in an earlier version of this paper and d.utterback for interesting related questions and encouragement , as well for suggestions leading to an improvement of the presentation in several places .",
