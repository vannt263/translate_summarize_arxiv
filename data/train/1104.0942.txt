    "use of personal social networks to gather information is fundamental to purchasing behavior  @xcite .",
    "it is something so common in our daily routine that we usually do not even make a note of it .",
    "when we make a purchase from a retail store , we often speak beforehand to the shopkeeper about suitable products .",
    "when we need to purchase something we are unfamiliar with , we consult our friends and family for advice .",
    "when we purchase a popular new product , we have an urge to tell everyone we know about it .",
    "although personal social networks are implicit in the offline shopping experience , their introduction to the online world is a relatively new phenomenon .",
    "e - commerce websites , such as amazon , ebay and epinions , have successfully integrated product reviews , recommendations , search and product comparison , but they have been much slower at adopting social networking features as a part of customer experience .",
    "recommendation engines and product comparison sites help consumers discover new products and receive more accurate evaluations , however they can not completely substitute for the personalized recommendations and information that one receives from a friend or relative .",
    "basic behavioral psychology drives consumers to value and trust their friends purchasing decisions more than anonymous opinions .",
    "for example , a lucid marketing survey found that 68% of individuals consulted friends and relatives before purchasing home electronics  @xcite .",
    "understanding how social networks are used and how they shape purchasing decisions is one of the fundamental interests of e - commerce .",
    "only recently have social networks been used in e - commerce applications to some success .",
    "for example , group purchasing companies such as groupon and livingsocial allow consumers to come together to buy products in bulk and save money , while social shopping sites such as kaboodle provide consumers the ability to share shopping lists with each other .",
    "the use of social networks in online shopping provides marketers and businesses with new revenue opportunities , while providing consumers with product information and both economic and social rewards for sharing  @xcite .",
    "* present work .",
    "* when discussing the relationship between electronic commerce and social networks , various questions come to mind .",
    "how do friends influence consumer purchasing decisions and product adoption ?",
    "what factors influence the success of word - of - mouth product recommendations ?",
    "how does social influence and reputation affect commercial activity ?",
    "in this paper , we will address these questions through a detailed study of the world s largest e - commerce website taobao .",
    "the fundamental process we focus upon throughout this study is what we term _ information passing _ : an individual purchases a product , then messages a friend , what is the likelihood that the friend will then purchase the product ? where will he purchase it from ? understanding the flow of social influence in commerce networks is an important question .",
    "for example , information passing provides insight into how companies can structure online viral marketing campaigns to target consumers .",
    "it can also be used to optimize algorithms within product recommendation engines .",
    "however important information passing is to electronic commerce , it still has not been well studied on a large scale due to the inaccessibility of suitable data .    to facilitate our research , we obtained a dataset describing the behavior of one million users in the world s largest e - commerce network taobao .",
    "taobao connects buyers and sellers , and provides an integrated instant messaging platform for communication among all its users . by modeling taobao as a network of three types of edges ( trades , messages , contacts ) , we are able to directly study how social communication and commercial transactions are interrelated in an online setting .",
    "our study provides insights into three main aspects of the social - commercial relationship : information passing , the price of trust , and consumer choice prediction .",
    "we begin our study of social commerce by quantifying the presence of information passing through analysis of triadic closure processes .",
    "we show that the influence of information passing is directly proportional to message strength , and is inversely proportional to product price , as well as the time between the purchase and the recommendation .",
    "additionally , we explain how information passing varies greatly between different product categories .",
    "we then investigate the general edge formation process in the context of directed triadic closure , and demonstrate that the formation of triad - closing message and trade edges is highly dependent upon user roles ( buyer or seller ) .",
    "our results indicate that information passing via buyer - buyer communication is one of the primary drivers of purchasing .",
    "a subtle point regarding information passing is that the spread of product recommendations , through word - of - mouth , inherently relies upon a notion of buyer - buyer _",
    "trust_. trust , from the perspective of social psychology , can be defined as perceived credibility or benevolence to the target  @xcite . in the context of electronic marketplaces , buyer - seller trust ,",
    "most directly encapsulated by seller reputations and ratings , are the natural concept to study .",
    "a fundamental idea behind the nature of trust is its price .",
    "how much extra will a buyer pay for transaction security with a highly - rated seller ?",
    "although an intuitive idea , initial studies did not find evidence for a price of trust  @xcite , and only recently has a price of trust been established in small , controlled , and single product settings  @xcite . in our study , we analyze transaction information across over 10,000 products . using the overall customer satisfaction ( i.e. , average rating ) of the seller",
    ", we observe a small but super - linear effect of the seller rating upon the price premium they can charge and still engage in transactions .",
    "to further study the relationship between social networks and consumer behavior , we then consider the question , `` how does an online consumer decide upon a seller to purchase from when there are many sellers offering the same product ? ''",
    "we model this question of _ consumer choice _ through a machine learning task and predict which particular seller a buyer will purchase from , given that the sellers all offer the same relevant product . utilizing primarily social networking features",
    ", we construct a model that can predict , for the case of a buyer choosing from among 10 possible sellers , the correct seller 42% of the time , approximately 4 times better than baseline .",
    "we also contrast a variety of feature sets ( both graph - based and product / seller metadata ) , and demonstrate that the social graph is the most important feature in predicting consumer choice . in particular , the social graph is a far better determinant of consumer behavior than metadata features such as seller reputation or product price .",
    "our results nicely connect to granovetter s work , which argues that economic transactions are embedded in dynamic social networks , and that an individual s social graph dictates how they choose sellers to transact with  @xcite",
    ".    * further related work . * [ sec : related ] for all of the importance of social networks in consumer shopping , though , their use in electronic commerce still is not well understood .",
    "previous research examined the use of social networks in e - commerce , but has mostly focused upon one aspect of the use of social networks , such as product recommendations  @xcite , product recommendation engines  @xcite , or have been based upon a limited set of data  @xcite .",
    "the electronic marketplace ebay is perhaps the most well studied e - commerce website .",
    "various aspects of ebay including auction efficiency  @xcite , product recommendations  @xcite , seller strategies  @xcite , and summarization  @xcite , have been studied .",
    "closely related to our work on consumer choice prediction , wu and bolivar created a model to predict item purchase probability  @xcite .",
    "the primary difference here is that we utilize the social networks of the buyers and sellers , along with product and user metadata , to perform consumer choice prediction , whereas they consider only seller and product information .",
    "our study of information passing and triadic closure builds upon classical works by rapoport  @xcite and granovetter  @xcite .",
    "triadic closure has been explored in various settings : community growth  @xcite , link prediction  @xcite , signed networks  @xcite , and social  @xcite and information  @xcite network evolution .",
    "in contrast , we demonstrate the existence of implicit recommendation behavior in a network not specifically designed for information passing .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the taobao dataset . in section 3",
    ", we analyze dyadic relationships in the network . in section 4",
    ", we provide a detailed analysis of information passing and directed triadic closure processes . in section 5",
    ", we quantify a price for trust . and",
    "last , in section 6 , we model the consumer choice prediction problem .",
    "the data we use in this study comes from the chinese website taobao , one of the world s largest electronic marketplaces , with over 370 million registered users at the end of 2010 . although transactions on taobao can be either business - to - consumer , business - to - business , or consumer - to - consumer , the bulk of the products are sold by online storefronts operated by small businesses or individuals . perhaps the most unique aspect of taobao is its integrated in - browser instant messaging platform , which allows us to correlate users communication patterns and purchasing behavior .",
    "any user can purchase goods from other users , add other users onto their contact list , and message other users .",
    "note that non - contacts can message each other as well .",
    ".dataset statistics .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     * experimental results . *",
    "table  [ table : predresults ] gives an overview of our experimental results where we compare the models using various feature sets and the baselines .",
    "first , we note that the model trained on all 23 features gives a 79% improvement over the p@1 of the random baseline and a 38% improvement over random s mrr .",
    "the model also gives a 13% improvement over the mostmsg baseline and a 93% improvement over the minprice baseline .",
    "for all our evaluation metrics , the model displays significantly better performance than the 3 baselines .",
    "it is interesting to note the poor performance of minprice compared to mostmsg .",
    "this suggests that communication links and the social graph are essential to understanding how consumers make purchasing decisions in social commerce networks .",
    "note that a natural explanation for the importance of the social graph can be that a buyer first messages a seller , then immediately trades with him .",
    "however , we control for this by discarding all communication on and after the trade date .    to evaluate prediction performance in more detail , we graph the p@1 and mrr of the full model ( labeled as _ svm _ ) and the 3 baselines versus the number of sellers in the buyer - seller cluster ( i.e. , how many different sellers a buyer can choose from ) in figures  [ fig : prediction](a),(e ) .",
    "as expected , the performance of all models and baselines decreases as the number of sellers in the cluster increases .",
    "observe that the performance gap between the full model and mostmsg , the strongest baseline , widens as the number of sellers to choose from increases and prediction becomes more difficult .",
    "if we look at the proportional p@1 improvement of the full model over mostmsg , we see only a 4.5% improvement when there are 2 sellers , but a 39.5% improvement when there are 10 sellers . in particular",
    ", we would like to highlight the full model s strong p@1 of 42.1% for the challenging prediction task with 10 sellers .",
    "in general , the full power of the model is not realized until the prediction problem becomes difficult for simple rule - based heuristics .    *",
    "different feature sets . *",
    "having constructed a successful predictive model , we now ask , `` what features are most valuable when modeling consumer choice ? '' in the following set of experiments , we contrast the performance of svm models trained on different sets of graph and metadata features in order to better understand how consumers make purchasing decisions .    when doing prediction , are network features as valuable as metadata features such as product price and seller rating ?",
    "we first compare the performance of a svm trained on network ( graph ) features versus a svm trained on metadata ( seller profile and product description ) features .",
    "we find that the p@1 of the graph features svm is only slightly worse than the full model , whereas the metadata features svm is not much better than random , as displayed in table  [ table : predresults ] .",
    "most notably , there is a large performance gap between the graph features svm compared to the metadata features svm , as illustrated in figures  [ fig : prediction](d),(h ) .",
    "this implies that prediction using only seller and product information is inadequate , the social and trade networks in the neighborhood of the buyer and seller must be taken into account .",
    "buyers likely do not just use seller profile and product information when making purchasing decisions .    given that network features are essential when predicting consumer choice ,",
    "what type of network features are more valuable for prediction : direct features or indirect features ( i.e. , clustering coefficients , pageranks ) ? for this experiment , we train svm models on direct and indirect network features , the different graph feature classes we use are listed in table  [ table : featureset ] . note that when comparing direct and indirect network features , we include all metadata features in both sets . figures  [ fig : prediction](c),(g ) illustrate the large performance gap between the _ meta + direct _ svm vs the _",
    "meta + indirect _",
    "svm , labeled as _ direct _ and _ indirect _ respectively in the figures .",
    "we observe that direct graph information provided by buyer - seller edges is significantly more valuable than the collective information provided by other edges in the local neighborhoods .",
    "this is not surprising because powerful information content is present in direct edges .",
    "historical buyer - seller message volume can be indicative of an existing social relationship or historical product queries , while historical buyer - seller trade volume can be indicative of customer loyalty and trust with the seller .",
    "which network ( contact , message , trade ) is most useful for predicting consumer choice ? in this section , we contrast svm models trained on each of the separate taobao networks .",
    "we include all metadata features with each set of network features in this experiment as well , prediction results are displayed in table  [ table : predresults ] .",
    "the performance of the 3 network feature sets versus the number of sellers in the cluster are displayed in figures  [ fig : prediction](b),(f ) .",
    "our experiment demonstrates that the message network is the most valuable network to utilize when predicting consumer choice .",
    "one possible explanation for this finding is that historical message volume is an indicator of familiarity between buyer and seller , i.e. , an existing trust relationship between buyer and seller .",
    "historical message volume can also indicate previous potential purchase interest .",
    "we also observe that prediction with the trade network is slightly better than that with the contact network .",
    "this suggests that customer loyalty , the primary trade network feature we use , is a more important indicator of consumer choice than the network of contacts .",
    "our explanation for this is that , inherently , contact links are less valuable than trade or message links in such social networks .",
    "it takes little effort to add someone to a friends list , as it is a one - time operation .",
    "in contrast , maintaining a conversation requires an investment of time and mutual interest on the part of both parties .",
    "forming a trade link is arguably the most costly as it requires currency and an actual transaction to make the connection .",
    "* per - category performance .",
    "* after performing prediction with a single svm ranking model , the next question to ask is , `` can we perform better prediction through the use of multiple models ? '' to answer this question , we segment all historical transactions in our dataset into their respective product categories , and train separate svm ranking models for each category .",
    "the results of our model testing are displayed as _ aggregated _ in figure  [ fig : prediction](a),(e ) . as expected , the aggregated performance of the category svms is slightly better than the single full svm , with a p@1 of 0.58 compared to 0.56 .",
    "our study of consumer choice prediction demonstrates that in social commerce sites such as taobao , user communication and social activity is the primary influence upon consumer choice . utilizing primarily social networking features , we are able to construct an svm model that can predict , for the case of a buyer choosing from among 10 possible sellers , the correct seller 42% of the time , approximately 4 times better than random . when faced with a selection of substitute goods offered by different sellers , buyers will not just choose their preferred seller through simple heuristics regarding price or rating .",
    "we can imagine that buyers utilize many sources of information ( seller history , advice of friends , seller s messages ) , and each buyer processes the information in their own way in order to make a personal purchasing decision .",
    "although we can not say with certainty what buyers are thinking , we can definitively state that the social graph in which the buyer and seller are embedded is the best feature to look at when predicting consumer choice .",
    "our work analyzes the activities of one million users of the chinese social commerce site taobao . through the study of directed closure rules",
    ", we empirically verify that implicit information passing is present in the taobao network , and show that communication between buyers is a fundamental driver of purchasing activity .",
    "we then investigate the directed triadic closure process and explain how link formation is highly dependent upon the distribution of buyer / seller roles for the nodes of a social commerce network .",
    "third , we use taobao review data to demonstrate how high seller ratings are associated with product price premiums , and thus quantify a price for trust .",
    "finally , we develop a machine learning model to accurately predict consumer choice , and demonstrate that the social network is the most important feature in predicting how consumers choose their transaction partners .",
    "we hope that our study will motivate future research into social shopping , as well as give impetus to established e - commerce companies to add more social networking features .",
    "future areas of related study include : analysis of user browsing data to develop refined consumer choice models for social commerce , study of information passing while factoring in both buyer - buyer and buyer - seller trust relationships , and viral marketing to influence consumer choice in social commerce ."
