    "measurement of the fluctuations in the intensity of redshifted 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen promises to be a powerful probe of the reionization era ( furlanetto et al .",
    "the process of hydrogen reionization started with ionized ( hii ) regions around the first galaxies , which later grew to surround groups of galaxies .",
    "reionization completed once these hii regions overlapped ( defining the so - called _ overlap _ era ) and filled - up most of the volume between galaxies .",
    "detection of the redshifted 21 cm signal will not only probe the astrophysics of reionization , but also the matter power spectrum during the epoch of reionization ( mcquinn et al .",
    "2006 ; bowman et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the conventional wisdom presumes that the 21 cm signal would disappear after the _ overlap _ epoch , because there is little neutral hydrogen left through most of intergalactic space .",
    "however , wyithe & loeb  ( 2007 ) recently demonstrated that fluctuations in the 21 cm emission would remain substantial over a range of epochs following the end of the overlap era owing to the significant fraction by mass of neutral hydrogen that is locked up in the dense pockets that form the damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) such as gas - rich galaxies .",
    "these systems trace the matter power spectrum on large scales .",
    "hence observations of 21 cm fluctuations could in principle be used as a cosmological probe both during the reionization era and in the post reionization igm .",
    "the sky temperature , which provides the limiting factor in the system noise at the low frequencies relevant to 21 cm studies , is proportional to @xmath7 , and so is a factor of @xmath8^{2.6}$ ] smaller at low redshifts than for observations at @xmath9 . as a result , detectability of fluctuations in 21",
    "cm emission may not decline substantially following the overlap epoch . when combined with the large fluctuations in redshifted 21 cm emission during the reionization era , the detectability of a 21 cm power spectrum after the end of reionization will allow the measurement of cosmological parameters over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "much of this constraining power originates with redshift space distortions ( mcquinn et al .",
    "2006 ) , which probe cosmology through the mapping between the vectors describing the wave number , and the emission frequency plus the visibility .",
    "the correct mapping produces an undistorted power spectrum . in this paper",
    "we consider baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "these provide constraints on cosmology that are related to redshift space distortions , but which are particularly sensitive to the dark energy .",
    "the bao scale provides a cosmic yardstick that can be used to measure the dependence of both the angular diameter distance and hubble parameter on redshift .",
    "the wavelength of the bao is related to the size of the sound horizon at recombination .",
    "its value depends on the hubble constant , and on the matter and baryon densities . however , it does not depend on the amount or nature of the dark energy",
    ". thus measurements of the angular diameter distance and hubble parameter can in turn be used to constrain the possible evolution of the dark energy with cosmic time .",
    "this idea was originally proposed in relation to galaxy redshift surveys ( blake & glazebrook  2003 ; hu & haiman  2003 ; seo & eisenstein 2003 ) and has since received significant theoretical attention ( e.g. glazebrook & blake  2005 ; seo & eisenstein  2005 ; seo & eisenstein 2007 ; angulo et al . 2007 ) . moreover ,",
    "measurement of the bao scale has been achieved within large surveys of galaxies at low redshift , illustrating its potential ( cole et al .  2005 ; eisenstein et al .  2005 ) .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys are best suited to studies of the dark energy at relatively late times due to the difficulty of obtaining accurate redshifts for large numbers of high redshift galaxies .",
    "if the dark energy behaves like a cosmological constant , then its effect on the hubble expansion is dominant only at @xmath10 and becomes negligible at @xmath11 . in this",
    "case studies of the bao scale at low redshift would provide the most powerful measurement .",
    "however , the origin of the dark energy is not understood , and so it is not known a  priori which redshift range should be studied in order to provide optimal constraints on possible theories for it .    at high redshifts , baryonic acoustic oscillations in the 21 cm power spectrum should be detectable during the reionization era using future low frequency arrays ( bowman , morales & hewitt  2007 ) . following the end of the reionization era ,",
    "the detection of a large number of individual galaxies in redshifted 21 cm emission could be used to trace the matter power spectrum using the future generation of radio telescopes ( abdalla & rawlings  2005 ) , in a manner entirely analogous to optical galaxy redshift surveys . on the other hand , 21 cm observations using a low - frequency compact radio array",
    "could also detect fluctuations in the total neutral hydrogen content within volumes of igm dictated by the telescope beam and frequency band pass .",
    "thus , in analogy to observations of the neutral igm during the reionization era , one could construct the power spectrum of 21 cm intensity fluctuations in the cumulative 21 cm signal from all the unresolved pockets of neutral hydrogen in the igm , regardless of their mass .",
    "an important advantage of studying the matter power spectrum through detection of fluctuations in the total emission of unresolved sources , rather than in the space density of individual sources , is that the requirement of object detection is removed which , as we show , allows the power spectrum to be determined at much higher redshifts where individual sources may not be resolved in sufficient numbers .",
    "our goal in this paper is to investigate the feasibility of using redshifted 21 cm observations to make precise measurements of the scale of the bao in the matter power spectrum .",
    "we show that observations of the acoustic scale using 21 cm emission could be used to constrain the nature of the dark energy in the unexplored redshift range of @xmath12 , as well as during the reionization era , and so would be complementary to galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "no other probes for precision cosmology are currently being applied to this cosmic epoch ( corasaniti , huterer , & melchiorri 2007 ) .",
    "the outline is as follows . in ",
    "[ 21cmps ] and [ uncertainty ] we will describe our approach for calculating the 21 cm power spectrum , and its measurement uncertainties .",
    "the precision with which the scale of acoustic oscillations can be detected using upcoming 21 cm observatories will be analyzed in ",
    "[ 21cmbao ] , with the corresponding constraints on the evolution of dark energy discussed in   [ darkenergy ] .",
    "finally , we will summarize our main conclusions in   [ conclusion ] . unless otherwise specified we adopt the set of cosmological parameters determined by _",
    "( spergel et al . 2007 ) for a flat @xmath13cdm universe .",
    "a powerful statistical probe of the reionization era will be provided by the power spectrum of 21 cm emission which is naturally accessible to interferometric observations such as those to be carried out by the mileura widefield array ( mwa ) or the low frequency array ( lofar ) .",
    "we may write the following expression for the power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the primordial power spectrum of the density field as a function of wave number @xmath16 , extrapolated linearly to @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the growth factor for linear perturbations .",
    "we model the power spectrum , including baryonic oscillations using the transfer function from eisenstein & hu  ( 1998 ) .",
    "the bias like quantity @xmath19 , which has dimensions of temperature , may be determined from detailed numerical simulations or from an appropriate analytical model for bubble growth . the bias @xmath20 will in general be a function of time and scale .",
    "we base our estimate for @xmath20 on the modeling presented in wyithe & loeb  ( 2007 ) . at a specified redshift , our model yields the mass - averaged fraction of ionized regions , @xmath21 , on various scales , @xmath22 , as a function of overdensity , @xmath23 .",
    "we may then calculate the corresponding 21 cm brightness temperature contrast @xmath24\\left(1+\\frac{4}{3}\\delta\\right),\\ ] ] where the pre - factor of 4/3 on the overdensity refers to the spherically averaged enhancement of the brightness temperature due to peculiar velocities in overdense regions ( bharadwaj & ali  2005 ; barkana & loeb  2005a ) . given the distribution of @xmath23 from the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations",
    ", we may find the probability distribution @xmath25 of brightness temperature @xmath26 in redshifted 21 cm intensity maps .",
    "the second moment of this distribution @xmath27 corresponds to the auto - correlation function of brightness temperature smoothed on a scale @xmath22 .",
    "the effective bias can be estimated directly from our calculation of the auto - correlation function @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the variance of the density field smoothed on a scale @xmath22 .    )",
    "computed from our semi - analytic model at 3 different scales ( dark solid , dashed and dotted lines ) . for comparison",
    "the figure also shows three curves for the bias corresponding to the 21 cm fluctuations given by spatially uniform mean neutral fractions , with fluctuations due to the density field . in the three cases the neutral fractions are equal to 1 ( fully neutral , dashed grey line ) , 0.03 ( the neutral fraction in dlas at @xmath30 , dotted grey line ) , and the mean neutral fraction from our model ( solid grey line ) . _ lower panel : _ the bias ( @xmath20 ) computed from our numerical model at 4 different wave numbers @xmath16 ( dark solid , dotted , short - dashed and long - dashed lines ) .",
    "the semi - analytic estimate at @xmath31mpc is also shown for comparison.,width=321 ]    the upper panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the bias ( @xmath20 ) computed from our semi - analytic model .",
    "curves are shown for model fluctuations computed at three different scales , each of which is larger than the typical bubble scale during the reionization era . for comparison , the figure also shows three curves for the bias corresponding to the 21 cm fluctuations given by spatially uniform mean neutral fractions , with fluctuations due to the density field . in the three cases , the neutral fractions are equal to 1 ( fully neutral ) , 0.03 ( the neutral fraction in dlas at @xmath30 ) , and the mean neutral fraction from our model .",
    "we note that our analytic estimate of the bias is a weighted average of the bias on scales less than @xmath22 , whereas the bias in equation  ( [ p21 ] ) should be computed at a particular scale .",
    "the bias computed using our analytic model is quite insensitive to scale for @xmath32mpc , indicating that on large scales the bias is independent of wave number @xmath16 .    following the end of reionization ( i.e. @xmath33 )",
    "there are no longer separate ionized bubbles as most of the igm is ionized .",
    "wyithe & loeb  ( 2007 ) have shown that the skewness of the 21 cm intensity fluctuation distribution will be small during the post overlap epoch , which implies a linear relation between the matter and 21 cm power spectra . moreover , since the mean free path of ionizing photons becomes very large in the post overlap igm , the ionization field is smooth . as a result",
    "the relation between the density and 21 cm emission can be reliably estimated using the semi - analytic model .    however , during the reionization epoch the relation between the power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations and the underlying matter power spectrum is complex , and in the late stages is dominated by the formation of large ionized bubbles ( furlanetto et al .",
    "thus prior to the end of reionization one must be careful about applying equation  ( [ biaseq ] ) to estimate the 21 cm power spectrum in equation  ( [ p21 ] ) .",
    "on very large scales such as those corresponding to the scale of baryonic acoustic oscillations , the fluctuations should average over many bubbles so that the 21 cm power spectrum is again expected to be linearly related to the matter power spectrum ( mcquinn et al .",
    "indeed , the largest discrete hii region that could be observed during the reionization era is much smaller than the bao scale ( wyithe & loeb  2004 ) .",
    "redshift space distortions can be ignored in measuring the acoustic oscillations scale during reionization , since the characteristic peculiar velocity is less than one percent of the hubble velocity on this large scale .",
    "we have computed the matter and 21 cm power spectra from a hybrid simulation ( e.g. messinger & furlanetto  2007 ) using both analytical and numerical techniques ( geil & wyithe  2007 ) . at each of redshifts @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "we computed the 3-dimensional ionization field within simulation boxes of side length 3000 co - moving mpc .",
    "the simulations were computed with @xmath37 resolution elements in each case .",
    "for these simulations we used an input power spectrum which includes the bao signal . at @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ,",
    "the simulations have global neutral fractions of 98% , 48% and 11% respectively .",
    "the hybrid scheme of geil & wyithe  ( 2007 ) is able to compute the neutral fraction within pixels that are larger than the typical size of hii regions .",
    "this feature allows us to compute power spectra at very large scales even early in the reionization era when no hii regions are resolved .",
    "the left hand panels of figure  [ fig2 ] show the 21 cm emission from 12mpc slices through the simulation boxes at each redshift .",
    "the higher redshift example ( @xmath34 ) is early in the reionization era , and shows no hii regions forming at the resolution of the simulation ( i.e. the igm does not contain ionized bubbles with radii @xmath38 co - moving mpc ) .",
    "the fluctuations in the 21 cm emission are dominated by the density field at this time .",
    "the central redshift ( @xmath39 ) shows the igm midway through the reionization process , and includes a few hii regions above the simulation resolution .",
    "the lower redshift example is just prior to overlap , when the igm is dominated by large percolating hii regions , which are well resolved at the @xmath40mpc resolution of our simulation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the utility of 21 cm observations of the bao scale as a probe of dark energy at high redshift .",
    "it is therefore important to demonstrate that the percolation process does not wash out the signature of baos in the 21 cm power spectrum towards the end of the reionization era . in the central left panels of figure  [ fig1 ] we show the corresponding matter [ @xmath41 and 21 cm [ @xmath42 power spectra .",
    "the @xmath36 simulation exhibits a shoulder in the 21 cm power spectrum at a scale corresponding to the characteristic bubble size .",
    "this shoulder is also seen in analytic models of bubble growth ( furlanetto , zaldarriaga & hernquist  2004 ) . in the two higher redshift cases",
    "this shoulder is located at a scale below the simulation resolution .",
    "we may use these simulations to estimate the bias [ @xmath43 which is calculated from the square root of the ratio between the simulated 21 cm power spectrum and the simulated matter power spectrum ( using equation  [ biaseq ] ) . in the right hand panels of figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the resulting values of @xmath44 as a function of scale .",
    "to illustrate the presence of baos in 21 cm power spectra computed using these simulations , we have also calculated the difference between the 21 cm power spectrum constructed from the simulation and a no wiggle reference 21 cm power spectrum [ i.e. @xmath45 . this difference is plotted in the central right panels of figure  [ fig2 ] . to construct @xmath46",
    "we have multiplied a theoretical no wiggle reference matter power spectrum ( @xmath47 ) by the bias computed from the same simulation box [ i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "note that since the boxes at each redshift were generated using the same realization of the matter power spectrum , the noise is correlated between the resulting 21 cm power spectra .",
    "for comparison we also plot the difference between the theoretical matter power spectrum and the theoretical no wiggle reference matter power spectrum , multiplied by the bias and growth factor squared [ i.e. @xmath49 , which is shown by the red line in figure  [ fig2 ] ] .",
    "the grey band around this line illustrates the level of statistical scatter in realizations of the power spectrum due to the finite size of the simulation volume ( e.g. peacock & west  1992 ) .",
    "these simulations demonstrate that the 21 cm power spectrum will exhibit baos throughout the reionization epoch including the percolation phase of hii regions .",
    "our simulations show that @xmath20 will be constant on scales much larger than the characteristic size of hii regions , but scale dependent at larger values of @xmath16 .",
    "the critical @xmath16-scale below which @xmath20 is nearly constant moves to smaller values of @xmath16 as reionization proceeds and the ionized bubbles grow in size .",
    "early in the reionization process our results show that there is only a very weak dependence of @xmath20 on scale since the fluctuations are driven by the density field .",
    "indeed , our modeling shows the scale dependence of @xmath20 to be weak on the scales of interest for bao at all times until the end of the reionization era . at this time , just prior to the full overlap between hii regions , the simulations show a strong dependence of @xmath20 on scale for @xmath50 ( comparable to the bao scale ) due to the formation of large bubbles .",
    "smaller than the bao scale since the evolution of the power spectrum becomes more rapid than the light crossing time of the bao scale ( wyithe & loeb  2004 ) .",
    "] our simulations suggest that the scale dependent bias distorts the observed power spectrum of baos ( see the panels in figure  [ fig2 ] corresponding to @xmath36 ) .",
    "however this distortion , which causes the ratio of peak heights to increase relative to a spectrum with constant bias , is not expected to effect the extraction of the bao scale .",
    "this is because in practice , the matter power spectrum could be fitted to the data using a scale dependent bias ( seo & eisenstein  2005 ) .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath20 are plotted as a function of redshift in the lower panel of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "also shown is the semi - analytic estimate of @xmath51 on a scale of @xmath31mpc , which has been re - plotted for comparison .",
    "our analytic and numerical models predict similar values of @xmath51 and similar behavior with redshift .",
    "in particular , @xmath20 has a value of a few tens of mk both at the very beginning and very end of reionization , despite the very different values of the global neutral fraction .",
    "in addition , on scales much greater than the typical bubble size there is a local minimum in the value of @xmath52 midway through reionization , corresponding to the shift from fluctuations in 21 cm emission being dominated by fluctuations in the density to fluctuations in the ionization field .",
    "however , the semi - analytic and numerical models do not agree in detail .",
    "the semi - analytic model does not include a poisson component of fluctuation due to the finite number of bubbles in a region of radius @xmath22 and so underestimates the value of @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    ", our numerical scheme does not conserve photons [ reflecting a limitation of semi - numerical models of this type ( messinger & furlanetto  2007 ) ] . as a result , while our model predicts the topology of hii regions at a particular value of neutral fraction , it does not correctly predict the relation between the average neutral fraction and redshift . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "this manifests itself as an offset in the redshift where the local minimum of the bias is predicted to occur .    in light of the results described above , we have chosen to use the value for @xmath20 computed at @xmath31mpc based on our semi - analytic model through the remainder of this paper .",
    "the semi - analytic model makes a conservatively low estimate of @xmath20 at all redshifts and so will yield conservative estimates for the sensitivity of upcoming 21 cm facilities to the 21 cm power spectrum .",

    "the number of modes observed depends on the volume of the survey , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the total physical surface area of an antenna ( this point is discussed further below ) .",
    "the sensitivity to the 21 cm power spectrum is dependent on both the sensitivity of the telescope to a particular mode , and to the number of such modes in the survey .",
    "the former is set by the effective collecting area ( @xmath73 ) of each antenna element ( as well as the total number of antennae ) , while the latter is sensitive to the total physical area covered by each antenna ( which we refer to as @xmath72 ) . for a traditional interferometer consisting of a number of dishes in a phased array ,",
    "these two areas are approximately equivalent @xmath74 , since the solid angle of the primary beam and the sensitivity are both proportional to the physical collecting area of the dish .",
    "however in constructing the above formalism for the sensitivity to the power spectrum , we have explicitly allowed @xmath75 .",
    "this is because future interferometers being built to measure fluctuations from the epoch of reionization ( like the mwa ) will not be comprised of dishes , but rather a large number of tiles , each consisting of a phased array of @xmath76 dipoles distributed over an area @xmath72 . since the size of the dipole will be much lower than @xmath77 for observations of the 21 cm line at @xmath78 , the effective collecting area of each tile in this regime is @xmath79 ( bowman et al .",

    "we note that at some redshifts the mwa5000 would be cosmic variance limited on scales relevant to bao studies . as a result if an ska were built with a design based on the mwa5000 , but with ten times the collecting area , no substantial gains could be made using observations of an individual field .",

    "the very large areas of sky that must be surveyed in order to measure the bao scale using galaxy redshift surveys arise because very large volumes must be sampled in order to beat down the statistical noise on the large scale modes relevant to baos .",

    "these windows include the reionization era , as well as the range @xmath264 , where the precision obtained would be comparable to ambitious high redshift spectroscopic surveys of @xmath159 galaxies , covering more than 1000 square degrees ( glazebrook & blake  2005 ) .",
    "moreover , since observations of the bao scale in 21 cm fluctuations can be extended down to @xmath143 there will be an opportunity to demonstrate that the results match those from other well studied techniques .",
    "however , at @xmath78 , where the acoustic peak scale is not accessible through standard techniques , the 21 cm power spectrum would provide unique constraints on the dark energy .",

    "<S> low - frequency observatories are currently being constructed with the goal of detecting redshifted 21 cm emission from the epoch of reionization . </S>",
    "<S> these observatories will also be able to detect intensity fluctuations in the cumulative 21 cm emission after reionization , from hydrogen in unresolved damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( such as gas rich galaxies ) down to a redshift @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations at all redshifts will show acoustic oscillations , whose co - moving scale can be used as a standard ruler to infer the evolution of the equation of state for the dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the first generation of low - frequency experiments ( such as mwa or lofar ) will be able to constrain the acoustic scale to within a few percent in a redshift window just prior to the end of the reionization era , provided that foregrounds can be removed over frequency band - passes of @xmath2mhz . </S>",
    "<S> this sensitivity to the acoustic scale is comparable to the best current measurements from galaxy redshift surveys , but at much higher redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> future extensions of the first generation experiments ( involving an order of magnitude increase in the antennae number of the mwa ) could reach sensitivities below one percent in several redshift windows and could be used to study the dark energy in the unexplored redshift regime of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , new experiments with antennae designed to operate at higher frequencies would allow precision measurements ( @xmath4 ) of the acoustic peak to be made at more moderate redshifts ( @xmath5 ) , where they would be competitive with ambitious spectroscopic galaxy surveys covering more than 1000 square degrees . </S>",
    "<S> together with other data sets , observations of 21 cm fluctuations will allow full coverage of the acoustic scale from the present time out to @xmath6 .    </S>",
