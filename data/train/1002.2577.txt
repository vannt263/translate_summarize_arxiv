    "the physics of small and large polarons is increasingly one of the most intriguing branches of contemporary solid state physics .",
    "polarons are often discussed in connection to the transport and optical properties of doped semiconductors@xcite .",
    "the kinetic properties of polaronic systems are well studied in the limit of small density of polarons@xcite .",
    "however , the situation becomes more complicated in the case of heavily doped semiconductors and insulators .",
    "the correlations between polarons may lead to the formation of a homogeneous gas of bipolarons or the formation of a charge ordered@xcite or phase separated state@xcite .",
    "indeed charge segregation of polarons has recently been discussed in literature@xcite .",
    "the kinetic properties of a dilute bipolaron gas are known in the band limit@xcite and in the limit of hopping conductivity@xcite . on the other hand the kinetic properties of charge ordered and especially phase separated polarons and bipolarons",
    "remain an open and challenging problem .",
    "the generally accepted mechanism of charge transport in doped semiconductors at low temperature is variable range hopping ( vrh ) of localized electrons in the impurity band@xcite .",
    "inclusion of the long range coulomb interaction leads to the opening of the efros - shkolvskii coulomb gap and a modified temperature dependence of the conductivity , compared to the vrh model@xcite . increasing the complexity further ,",
    "there have been increasing debates about the role of multi - electron hopping conductivity .",
    "tielsen and schreiber have performed extensive calculations and came to conclusion that the many - electron hopping processes become dominant at low temperatures@xcite , which was also supported by simulations@xcite .",
    "later , these results were challenged by tsigankov and efros@xcite who argued that a different choice of hopping rates leads to a substantial suppression of the two - particle contribution .",
    "more recently@xcite it was shown that if one assumes more general hopping rates , the many - particle contribution to the conductivity may remain important at low temperatures .",
    "thus the many - particle contribution to the conductivity of doped semiconductors and insulators , particularly at low temperatures remains controversial and limits our understanding of the transport not only in doped polar semiconductors , but also doped cuprates ( including high - temperature superconductors)@xcite , doped manganites@xcite and many other materials@xcite where the electron - phonon interaction is intermediate or strong .",
    "recently we have shown that doping a semiconductor with charged carriers leads to the segregation of polarons on short length scale@xcite .",
    "we have shown that polaron clustering with an even number of particles is more favorable than with an odd number of particles , because of the particular symmetry of the short range potential and topology of the lattice .",
    "this suggests that we can consider these clusters to be effectively composed from bipolarons and it is natural to expect that the low temperature conductivity will be determined by bipolaron hopping because the formation of clusters with an odd number of polarons are energetically less favorable . in our model",
    "calculations@xcite the distance between polarons within the bipolaron is small ( inter - site bipolarons ) so the model calculations of electronic transport are less sensitive to the choice of the hopping probability@xcite than in the case of the standard coulomb gas .    here",
    "we present extensive numerical simulations of polaron@xcite and bipolaron hopping conductivity in the charge segregated state which appears as a result of doping the strongly - correlated insulator .",
    "we show that at low concentration and low temperature bipolaron transport becomes dominant whereby the addition of a short range attraction caused by the lattice deformation to the standard coulomb gas hamiltonian unambiguously leads to the dominant role of the two - particle conductivity at low temperatures .",
    "to perform the simulations we chose the lattice gas model on a 2d square lattice with competing long - range coulomb and short range anisotropic jahn - teller ( jt)-like interactions , because it naturally describes the formation of bipolarons and bipolaronic clusters .",
    "the model in terms of the pseudospin operators , @xmath1 , can be written as,@xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 @xmath4 represent a single particle in either of the states of the electronic jt doublet at the site @xmath5 and @xmath6 represents an unoccupied site .",
    "@xmath7 is the on - site charge and @xmath8 is the dimensionless coulomb potential .",
    "@xmath9 represents the anisotropic short range jt interaction@xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian was used to demonstrate the stability of a variety of different textures which might appear upon doping of strongly correlated 2d insulators .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the short range attractive potential alone leads to global phase separation which is frustrated by the long - range coulomb potential@xcite .",
    "the system has a glassy ground state with many minima in the free energy .",
    "to analyze the charge transport we use standard variable range hopping transport theory@xcite .",
    "the applicability of this theory is justified by the glassy ground state demonstrated by previous simulations@xcite .",
    "the _ single particle hopping rate _ between an occupied site @xmath5 with pseudospin @xmath10 to an empty site @xmath11 with the resulting pseudospin @xmath12 is given by:@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dimensionless many body energy difference between the final and initial states in the presence of an external electric field , @xmath15 , applied along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "@xmath17 is the temperature and @xmath18@xmath19 is the transition probability , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the spatial extent of the single polaron wavefunction . for a given system configuration , @xmath22 , the total dimensionless instantaneous current is the sum over all possible hops : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , with the first sum running over all occupied states with @xmath25 and the second over all empty sites with @xmath26 with both possible final pseudospin states , @xmath27 . since only the hops with @xmath28 contribute to the net current the formula simplifies in the limit of the vanishing electric field to : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total number of particles / holes represents the number of holes in the system . ] and @xmath31 the dimensionless single polaron mobility .",
    "the second sum runs only over the final states with @xmath32 .",
    "bipolaron hopping is a second order process@xcite where a bipolaron @xmath33 hops to @xmath34 via the virtual dissociated states @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "tsigankov and efros@xcite argued that the hopping probability is suppressed when the distance between the particles _ within _ a hopping pair is large , which reduces the biparticle conductivity by orders of magnitude .",
    "this is not an issue in our case since the size of our bipolarons is restricted to one lattice constant .",
    "the matrix element for the bipolaron hop is given by : @xmath37 where the operator @xmath38 is determined by eq .",
    "( 4.13 ) of ref.@xcite and has both diagonal and off - diagonal elements in phonon occupation numbers .",
    "each matrix element in ( [ eq : tran - ampl ] ) contains a factor @xmath39 , which depends on the distance of the hop .",
    "the dependence of @xmath40 on the hop length is therefore @xmath41}$ ] .",
    "another question which should be addressed is the frequency of the hopping events which is determined by the pre - exponential factor of the matrix elements .",
    "here we are interested in the case when the single polaron hopping is allowed so the binding energy of the pair , @xmath42 , is small , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the phonon frequency .",
    "we can therefore assume that @xmath45 and the pre - exponential factor of @xmath40 is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the frequency for the single polaron jump .",
    "since we are interested in the single phonon processes the second matrix element in ( [ eq : tran - ampl ] ) must be diagonal in the phonon occupation numbers .",
    "the single polaron jumps occur with the frequency @xmath48 so up to a numerical factor of the order of 1 the pre - exponential factor of @xmath40 is @xmath49 , similar as in the single polaron hop case .",
    "the bipolaron - hopping - rate temperature independent pre - factor is therefore @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , and the _ bipolaron hopping rate _ is given by :    @xmath52    where @xmath33 denotes the nearest neighbors and @xmath53 is the many body energy difference between the final and initial states .",
    "the total bipolaron instantaneous current for a particular system configuration in the limit of vanishing electric field is similar to the single polaron case ,    @xmath54    the first sum runs over all occupied bipolaron and the second over all possible unoccupied bipolaron states with @xmath55 . for the sake of comparison with the single - polaron mobility eq.([eq : bp - current ] ) also defines the effective dimensionless bipolaron mobility @xmath56 per single particle / hole .",
    "we calculate the polaron and bipolaron mobilities at any given @xmath17 by averaging equations ( [ eq : sp - current ] ) and ( [ eq : bp - current ] ) over markov chains of the system configurations obtained by means of mc simulations .",
    "contrary to ref .",
    "[ a realistic mc dynamics , which includes correlated biparticle hops in the external field , is _ not required_. instead , unrestricted - length single - particle hops were used to improve convergence .",
    "the details of the used mc algorithm were described in ref.@xcite .    for the present calculations we used periodic boundary conditions on a system size @xmath57 after carefully checking for any size effects .",
    "the shape of the @xmath58 was taken to be nonzero only for @xmath59 and was therefore specified by a single parameter @xmath60 . to minimize further the computation time we limit the maximum hopping distance in equations ( [ eq : sp - current ] ) and ( [ eq : bp - current ] ) . after a careful check for convergence we set @xmath61 and selected the maximum hopping distance , @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mobility ] we plot calculated temperature dependence of mobilities at different dopings @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the total number of polarons in the system and @xmath65 represents particle and @xmath66 hole doping regions .",
    "temperature dependence of the single polaron mobility , @xmath67 , ( a ) and ( b ) and the effective bipolaron mobility , @xmath68 , ( c ) and ( d ) at @xmath69 at different doping levels @xmath70 . in the insets the corresponding hopping processes are shown schematically .",
    "the solid and dashed black lines show @xmath71 and @xmath72 slopes , respectively . ]    at high @xmath17 the second exponent in the sums ( [ eq : sp - current ] ) and ( [ eq : bp - current ] ) shows a negligible temperature dependence so the dominant contribution to temperature dependence of both mobilities comes from the @xmath71 prefactor .",
    "when the temperature is decreased we first observe the suppression of mobilities due to the orbital ( pseudospin ) ordering@xcite in the hole doping region , @xmath73 , which is most pronounced in the single polaron mobility .",
    "the suppression is due to the high energy cost of the hops with the pseudospin flip in the orbital ordered system which makes half of the final states almost inaccessible .    with further decrease of temperature ,",
    "the behavior of the mobility at low particle and low hole doping becomes almost identical : the single polaron mobility shows a maximum at any doping at the temperature @xmath74 , which is doping dependent .",
    "in contrast , the maximum is absent for the bipolaron mobility at low particle / hole doping .",
    "the bipolaron mobility even starts to increase faster than @xmath71 at low temperatures _ exceeding _ the single polaron mobility at low particle / hole doping and sufficiently strong attractive jt interaction , @xmath75 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : phase - diagrams ] ) .",
    "this is the most important result of our calculations .",
    "the explanation of this effect follows from the the fact that all particles in the cluster are paired , therefore formation of the clusters with odd number of particles is highly energetically unfavorable . with increased doping and strength of the attractive jt interaction",
    "also @xmath56 starts to show an inflection point at the temperature , @xmath76 , which is always lower in the bipolaron case .",
    "below @xmath74 ( @xmath76 ) both mobilities show an arrhenius temperature dependence ( see fig . [",
    "fig : phase - diagrams ] ) .",
    "the activation energies clearly show a _ smaller _ energy barrier for bipolaron hopping in comparison to single polaron hopping .",
    "in our simulation @xmath77 exceeds @xmath78 at small doping and low temperature .",
    "this however does not imply that the bipolaron mobility can not dominate the charge transport even at the intermediate dopings and for weaker jt attractions .",
    "if the binding energy of a bipolaron is larger than the phonon frequency , the single phonon processes which break the bipolaron are forbidden .",
    "the prefactor @xmath18 in the single particle hopping probability ( [ eq : hop - prob ] ) will be therefore strongly suppressed@xcite because more then one phonon is necessary to conserve energy .",
    "on the other hand , the bipolaron hopping processes do not require real bipolaron breaking .",
    "as our simulations show ( see bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagrams ] ) , the bipolaron hopping processes can have a lower energy barrier even with a moderate jt attraction and can be assisted by a single phonon leading to @xmath79 .",
    "this results in a further suppression of the single polaron transport with respect to the bipolaron transport .    in",
    "the hole doping region at low temperatures the system shows complete orbital ( pseudospin ) order.@xcite the effective attractive jt interaction between holes governing the hopping process then becomes isotropic . since in this case",
    "the bipolaron mobility also exceed the single - polaron one we can conclude that the anisotropy of the attractive interaction is unimportant with respect to the domination of the bipolaron transport at low @xmath17 .",
    "using a new technique for the calculation of the transport properties of polarons and bipolarons in the charge segregated state of doped classical strongly correlated systems in the hopping regime , we analyzed the electrical conductivity of a quasi-2d system with charge segregated polarons in a textured state driven by the coulomb interaction .",
    "the problem of choosing the appropriate hopping probability , which has been an issue in previous works@xcite has been sidestepped by the fact that the size of our bipolaron is small ( one lattice constant ) .",
    "we have shown that at high temperature the mobility of carriers increases with decreasing temperature as @xmath80 .",
    "single - polaron mobility shows a maximum at the characteristic temperature where clusters start to form .",
    "below this temperature , the single - polaron conductivity is exponentially suppressed because the single - polaron hopping requires dissociation of the polaron from a cluster . on the other hand",
    ", the bipolaron transport shows a weaker suppression , which starts at a lower temperature , and thus becomes the dominant transport channel at low temperatures .",
    "apart from resistivity , the peltier effect , the nernst effect , the hall effect and particularly the lorentz number are all expected to exhibit a low - temperature crossover when bipolaron transport becomes dominant , so the model predictions are eminently verifiable by experiment .",
