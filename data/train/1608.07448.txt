    "the binding energy b@xmath1 of a @xmath0-hyperon in a @xmath0-hypernucleus ( hypernucleus in the following ) , @xmath4z , is the most straightforward observable which characterizes such a strange nuclear system .",
    "it is defined as :    @xmath5\\ c^{2 }                                                       \\label{bl}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the mass of the @xmath0-hyperon , @xmath7 the mass of the core nucleus in its ground state and @xmath8 the mass of the hypernucleus .",
    "@xmath8 is determined by means of the measurement of the missing mass in production reactions with magnetic spectrometers or by the sum of the masses and of the kinetic energies of the decay products in measurements with photographic emulsions or bubble chambers .",
    "it was measured in the early days of hypernuclear physics by analyzing the events produced in stacks of photographic emulsions by the interaction of @xmath9 , both stopped and in flight . by taking advantage of the extreme precision of the emulsion technique in recognizing and in measuring the energies of all the charged products of the disintegration of a hypernucleus , it was possible to determine accurately b@xmath1 for hypernuclei in the 3 @xmath2 a @xmath2 15 range .",
    "@xcite summarizes the results achieved up to 1972 .",
    "they are listed in column 2 of table [ tab : tab1 ] which contains as well all the other experimental results discussed in the following . in a successive compilation",
    "@xcite some data were updated and two new entries ( @xmath10c and @xmath11c ) were added , as the result of experimental efforts after 1972 .",
    "they are indicated separately in column 2 of table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the quoted errors , of the order of the percent , are statistical only .",
    "[ tab : tab1 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the w.a . of the @xmath12 for @xmath13-shell hypernuclei is 17 @xmath14 97 kev .",
    "these evaluations support the prediction by gal @xcite that the effect due to the csb of the @xmath0n interaction in @xmath13-shell hypernuclei is lower than in @xmath15-shell .",
    "we remark that the present evaluation of the csb effect is the first one based only on published results by recent experiments performed with magnetic spectrometers featuring an absolute energy scale calibration .",
    "other recent evaluations were based on emulsion data @xcite , on a combination of emulsion and recent calibrated spectrometric data @xcite , on combinations of data from spectrometric results with absolute calibration and with normalization procedures @xcite .",
    "we have reorganized the recent data from finuda on the spectroscopy of @xmath13-shell hypernuclei for comparing them with the ones of the neutron - rich isobars from jlab . for both sets of data",
    "the energy scale exploits an absolute calibration and searches for csb effects in @xmath13-shell hypernuclei are thus reliable . comparing them with the previous results from studies with emulsions , we found that an offset of 66 @xmath14 30 kev should be applied to the b@xmath1 s from emulsions in comparing them with recent spectrometric data .    as first result",
    "we find that @xmath16 should be increased to 0.20 @xmath14 0.06 mev , and we think that some difficulties encountered in past analyses of the emulsion data on @xmath17 could find an explanation .",
    "it would be interesting to check this issue by a dedicated measurement that seems into the capabilities of jlab .",
    "it is also possible that information on @xmath16 could be achieved in the future by the alice experiment at cern lhc .",
    "very recently , the peaks corresponding to the invariant mass of @xmath18 ( and @xmath19 ) were determined with an incertitude of 1 mev on their centers to select the events for the determination of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the total number of such events was @xmath20200 @xcite .",
    "following the upgrades in the lhc luminosity and in the detector s components , an increase in the total number of events of nearly three orders of magnitude is expected for the run starting in 2019 @xcite .",
    "it is then plausible that the mass of @xmath18 could be determined with a precision of 10 kev or less .",
    "taking also advantage of the huge samples of @xmath0 and @xmath21 which will be collected simultaneously a careful control of all the systematic errors could be achieved .",
    "the recent precise measurement of b@xmath1(@xmath22 ) with the novel technique of @xmath23 decay spectroscopy confirms the existence and the magnitude of the archetype of the csb effect in the t=1/2 , a=4 hypernuclear ground states isodoublet .",
    "the same conclusion was drawn by the e13 collaboration at j - parc by measuring @xmath24rays for the @xmath25 transition in the @xmath26 hypernucleus @xcite . however , it should be desirable to perform a precise measurement of b@xmath1(@xmath27he ) by magnetic spectrometry for a comparison with the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "@xmath27he can be produced abundantly at j - parc by means of the well known two - body reactions @xmath28 or @xmath29 on a @xmath30he target .",
    "however a new generation of spectrometers with a resolution of some hundreds of kev and , first of all , with a reliable absolute energy calibration methodology must be developed .",
    "the pattern of the energy levels for all members of the t=1 , a=7 hypernuclear isotriplet ( @xmath31he , @xmath31li@xmath32 , @xmath31be ) was examined by combining the results from jlab , finuda and revised emulsion data .",
    "there is still a discrepancy on the values of b@xmath1(@xmath31li@xmath32 ) obtained by finuda and the revised emulsion data",
    ". it should be highly desirable to obtain a new value of b@xmath1(@xmath31be ) with spectrometers .",
    "pion decay high resolution spectroscopy of this proton - rich hyperfragment obtained by electroproduction may perhaps be attempted at mami or jlab in the future .",
    "finally values for @xmath12(a ) for a=7 , 12 and 16 were obtained by using data only from magnetic spectrometers with an absolute energy calibration . the w.a . of @xmath12(a ) for these @xmath13-shell hypernuclei is 17 @xmath14 97 kev , in agreement with recent theoretical evaluations .    just considering the strong theoretical effort in predicting several interesting effects related to the csb of @xmath13-shell and higher - a hypernuclei",
    ", it should be useful to start a similar effort on the experimental side .",
    "for the neutron - rich hyperisobars the complexes of spectrometers and associated technologies developed for the study of the electroproduction reaction are well shaped for the purpose .",
    "for the hypernuclei obtained by the use of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 reactions , a new experimental approach like the one mentioned previously for the case of b@xmath1(@xmath27he ) should be started .",
    "we are indebted to prof .",
    "g. wilquet for the very useful and clarifying correspondence on the methodology of the emulsions technique .",
