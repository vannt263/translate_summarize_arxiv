    "a consistent su(6 ) extension of the wt su(3 ) chiral lagrangian has been recently derived in ref .",
    "the building blocks of this extension are the \\{35 } ( for mesons ) and \\{56 } ( for baryons ) representations of su(6 ) .",
    "these representations can accommodate the @xmath7 meson octet ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , and the @xmath12 meson nonet ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) ; and the the spin @xmath18 members of the nucleon octet ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) and the spin @xmath23 members of the @xmath24 decuplet ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , respectively .",
    "the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite starts by assuming that the @xmath28-wave effective meson  baryon hamiltonian is su(6)-spin - flavor invariant , and it makes use of the underlying chiral symmetry to determine the value of the su(6 ) irreducible matrix elements from the su(3)-flavor wt interaction .",
    "this is possible since the wt lagrangian is not just su(3 ) symmetric but also chiral ( @xmath29 ) invariant .",
    "symbolically , @xmath30[b^\\dagger , b]\\right)\\ ] ] this structure , dictated by chiral symmetry , is more suitably analyzed in the @xmath31-channel .",
    "the mesons @xmath32 fall in the su(3 ) representation @xmath33 which is also the adjoint representation .",
    "the commutator @xmath34 $ ] indicates a @xmath31-channel coupling to the @xmath35 ( antisymmetric ) representation , thus @xmath36_{\\{1\\}}\\ ] ] since the \\{35 } is the adjoint representation of su(6 ) , the unique su(6 ) extension is @xmath37_{\\{1\\ } } \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] the potentials , @xmath38 , deduced from this su(6 ) lagrangian are used to solve the coupled channel bethe salpeter equation ( bse)@xcite within the so - called on shell renormalization scheme@xcite , leading to unitarized s - wave meson  baryon scattering amplitudes @xmath39 ( @xmath40 are the isospin , hypercharge and total angular momentum ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a diagonal loop function in the coupled channel space , which needs to be renormalized@xcite . in a given @xmath43 sector ,",
    "physical resonances appear as complex poles in the second riemann sheet@xcite of all matrix elements of @xmath44 in the coupled channel space .",
    "the pole position determines the mass and width of each resonance , while the different residues for each meson - baryon channel give the respective couplings and branching ratios@xcite .",
    "this model@xcite reproduces the essential features of previous studies@xcite ( properties of the lowest lying @xmath45 and @xmath46 resonances ) and , in addition , it sheds some light on the role played by the vector mesons in this context .",
    "for instance , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : gigj ] some predictions for the d ",
    "wave @xmath0 resonance@xcite .",
    "we naturally find that this resonance is placed quite close to the @xmath47 threshold and that its coupling to @xmath48 channel is quite small . indeed",
    ", we obtain a coupling much smaller than the value used by phenomenological studies of the @xmath0 photoproduction@xcite , which brings in interesting conclusions on the dominant reaction mechanism in these processes@xcite .",
    "the extension of the above model to describe charmed baryon resonances is straightforward .",
    "we use the \\{63 } and \\{120 } su(8 ) representations to accommodate mesons and baryons , respectively .",
    "in addition to those particles considered so far , these representations also contain the @xmath7 @xmath49 and @xmath12 @xmath50 mesons , and the @xmath18 @xmath51 and the @xmath23 @xmath52 charmed baryons . since the \\{63 } is the su(8 )",
    "adjoint representation , from the discussion above , the natural extension of the wt lagrangian to the su(8 ) spin - flavor symmetry group is @xmath53_{\\{1\\}}\\ ] ] we use the above interaction , with some explicit su(8 ) breaking effects induced by the use of experimental hadron masses and meson decay constants , to construct the kernel of the corresponding two body meson - baryon bse .",
    "so far , we have only analyzed the strangeness - less charm @xmath1 sector , where we have naturally found the @xmath45 @xmath3 ( with a very small coupling to the open @xmath54 channel ) and the @xmath46 @xmath5 resonances .",
    "these resonances have a clear parallelism with the four star resonances @xmath55 and @xmath0 , which appear in the ( charmless ) strangeness @xmath56 sector . besides , similarly to what happens in the case of the @xmath55 resonance",
    ", we have also found a second ( broad ) @xmath2 state close to the @xmath3 , but with a much larger coupling to the open @xmath57 channel .",
    "there have been several works@xcite on @xmath58 and @xmath59wave negative parity charmed baryon resonances . in all",
    "these works the zero - range @xmath31-channel exchange of vector mesons is identified as the driving force for the @xmath58wave scattering of pseudo - scalar mesons off the baryon ground states .",
    "a serious limitation of this @xmath31-channel vector meson - exchange ( tvme ) model is that while the pseudo - scalar mesons @xmath60 and @xmath61 are included in the coupled - channel dynamics , their vector partners @xmath62 and @xmath63 are completely ignored .",
    "this is not justified since qcd acquires a new spin - flavor symmetry@xcite , heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) , when the quark masses are much larger than the typical confinement scale , @xmath64 .",
    "hqs predicts that all type of spin interactions vanish for infinitely massive quarks . neglecting corrections of the order @xmath65 , the @xmath60 and @xmath62 or @xmath61 and @xmath66 mesons form a multiplet of degenerate hadrons@xcite . for finite charm quark mass ,",
    "the @xmath60 and the @xmath62 meson masses differ in just about one pion mass , even less for the strange charmed mesons , and thus it is reasonable to expect that the coupling @xmath67 might play an important role .",
    "our scheme naturally respects hqs , which justifies , at least in the charm sector , the assumption that the quark interactions are spin independent .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath62 degrees of freedom in the coupled channel formalism changes the dynamics .",
    "for instance , we find that @xmath68 component , absent in the tvme model , of the @xmath3 is sizable and much larger than the @xmath69 and the @xmath54 ones . as a consequence ,",
    "we predict a totally different dynamical picture for this resonance .",
