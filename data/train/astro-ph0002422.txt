    "recent observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ) at redshifts up to @xmath2 ( @xcite ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter @xcite ) have made possible classical cosmological tests that require standard candles , such as the magnitude - redshift relation .",
    "the most dramatic result is that these sne appear dimmer ( by @xmath0 magnitudes ) at high redshift than would be predicted in a non - accelerating universe , suggesting at face value that we live in an accelerating universe .",
    "however , other explanations are possible , including the one we consider here , namely that distant sne are dimmer due to extinction by intergalactic dust .    as distant standard candles , sne are sensitive probes of extinction in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the distribution of matter in the igm may now be modelled accurately in the context of modern cosmology using hydrodynamic simulations ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting igm is not smooth , but rather traces large - scale structure .",
    "if such structure contains not only dark matter and gas but also dust , this would result in significant variations in sne brightnesses due to intervening extinction .",
    "observationally , the distribution of type ia sne magnitudes has a very small dispersion ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus by comparing simulations to the distribution of observed brightnesses , we can set limits on the amount of dust extinction and possibly constrain its spatial distribution with respect to intergalactic gas . in this _",
    "we present a technique for doing this , and apply it to the sne observations of @xcite .",
    "intergalactic grey dust has been examined in a series of papers by aguirre ( 1999a , b ; hereafter @xcite ) and @xcite , who develop a scenario in which small grains are preferentially destroyed during ejection from galaxies , polluting the igm with large dust grains that are effectively grey in the bandpasses of the sne data .",
    "this greyness is necessary in order not to violate tight limits on reddening from sne data , which imply that galactic - type dust would provide negligible absorption ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a significant fraction of the dust must reside in the igm .",
    "if the grey dust causing extinction were present only in the ism of the supernova host galaxy , this would introduce too large a dispersion in observed sne magnitudes ( @xcite ) . in this study , we assume that grey dust blends smoothly from galaxies into the surrounding igm . our analysis is insensitive to the intrinsic properties of the dust , such as its opacity and grain size , since we use the simulations to directly translate the observed sne magnitude distribution into a dust extinction in magnitudes .",
    "it is , however , sensitive to the way in which dust traces the distribution of gas in the igm , and we will consider several simple but plausible variations of this relation .    in   [ sec : sims ] we describe our simulations of the igm , and of dust extinction . in ",
    "[ sec : anal ] we describe our analysis method and results , including constraints on grey dust afforded by current sn observations . in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] we discuss systematic uncertainties , and the implications of our results .",
    "we employ a hydrodynamic simulation of a @xmath3-dominated cold dark matter model , with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "our simulation volume is @xmath9  mpc with @xmath10  kpc spatial resolution , having @xmath11 dark matter and @xmath11 gas particles , and was evolved from @xmath12 using parallel treesph ( @xcite ) .    in order to obtain dust column densities along lines of sight ,",
    "we consider three different ways that dust may trace intergalactic hydrogen gas :    1 .",
    "@xmath13 : dust traces gas linearly .",
    "@xmath14 : dust traces metals linearly .",
    "@xmath15 : dust traces gas quadratically .    as our simulation makes no direct prediction for the metallicity of gas , we adopt a heuristic prescription ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , in the second case above .",
    "we assume that the metallicity is @xmath16 solar if the gas overdensity is less that 10 , solar if the overdensity is greater than 1000 , and log - linear in between .",
    "+ figure  1 : dust extinction maps in @xmath17 patches of sky out to @xmath18 ( left ) and @xmath19 ( right ) , for ( a ) @xmath13 and ( b ) @xmath15 the median extinction magnitude to @xmath19 is set equal to @xmath20 for both ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the maps correspond to what would be seen against a white background . 0.1 in [ fig : maps ]    to extract dust extinction values from the simulations , we assume that the gas associated with each particle is spread over its sph smoothing volume ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . we perform a numerical integration of gas column density along 5000 rays cast through these volumes , at the same time applying one of the three transformations given above to relate gas to dust densities . to reach the required path lengths out to @xmath21 ,",
    "we follow rays through 26 simulation volumes , each ray entering through a random point on a random face .",
    "this yields the column density of dust to @xmath19 along each line of sight .    in figure  1",
    "we show extinction maps of @xmath17 patches of sky , for ( a ) @xmath13 and ( b ) @xmath15 .",

    ", we show how the mean dust extinction and its dispersion varies with redshift . here , the dispersion in all three panels was set to be the same small value , equal to the difference in quadrature of the dispersion in sne magnitudes at high ( @xmath22 ) and low ( @xmath23 ) redshifts observed by @xcite , namely 0.03 mag . figs .  1 and 2",
    "show that the mean extinction is much greater when the dust is more smoothly distributed .",
    "we will now quantitatively explore the constraints that can be put on the dust extinction by using the observed distribution of sne magnitudes .",

    "filled squares show mean , open circles with line show the dispersion .",
    "values have been scaled to a dispersion of 0.03 magnitudes at @xmath19 . 0.1 in [ fig",
    "we make use of two characteristics of the observed sn data in our comparison , the change with redshift of the dispersion in sne magnitudes , and the shape of the histogram of sne magnitudes . as mentioned above , @xcite found little difference in the dispersions of two samples with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as they stated , this leaves little room for dispersion due to dust , as this dispersion is expected to increase for longer path lengths ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "in order to quantify this , and the effect of the distribution shape , we generate simulated sne magnitudes , and compare them to the @xcite data using a maximum likelihood approach .",
    "the observational datasets we use are both taken from @xcite ( their tables  1 and 2 ) , being the high-@xmath26 sne of the supernova cosmology project , and the low-@xmath26 sample of caln - tololo sne survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use 40 ( non - reddened sne ) of the former sne , between @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , and 16 of the latter sne which lie between @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "@xmath38 then corresponds to an open model with @xmath39 , and @xmath40 to an @xmath41 model .",
    "we generate the simulated datasets as follows : + ( 1 ) we renormalize the 5000 simulated lines - of - sight so that the median dust extinction to @xmath19 equals @xmath37 . + ( 2 )",
    "we add the cosmological shift , @xmath33 .",
    "+ ( 3 ) we broaden the magnitude distribution , which involves convolving it separately with a gaussian of width given by the observational error of each sn , and then adding these distributions together .",
    "when doing this , we include an `` intrinsic '' sn dispersion of @xmath42 mag ( @xcite ) .",
    "varying this ( by @xmath43 mag ) makes little difference to the results ( see  4 ) .",
    "+ ( 4 ) we truncate the distribution at a magnitude difference @xmath44 , to roughly account for the fact that sne along lines of sight passing through high extinction regions would not make it into these magnitude - limited samples .     + figure  3 : the pdf of magnitude differences , @xmath45 , for 5000 simulated sne .",
    "the shaded region is included in the calculation of the dispersion ; non - shaded region indicates heavily obscured sne that are not included in the pdf normalization .",
    "the histogram shows 40 of the high-@xmath26 sne of @xcite . 0.1 in [ fig : los ]",
    "we derive the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of sne magnitude differences @xmath45 predicted by the simulation , so that the predicted number of sne between @xmath45 and @xmath46 is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number of observed sne .",
    "figure  3 shows histograms of the pdf of @xmath45 , for @xmath49 mag and @xmath50 .",
    "we also plot the observational data of @xcite . in effect , for this plot , we have brightened the simulated sne to mimic an @xmath41 model and then dimmed them with dust .",
    "we can see that in panel ( a ) , where the dust is fairly smoothly distributed , the simulated pdf is not too different from the observations . in the other panels ,",
    "which have clumpier dust , there is a skewness not seen in the observed data , due to a long tail of high extinction lines - of - sight .    for each set of simulated lines of sight",
    ", we form the relative likelihood of drawing all the observed sne magnitudes , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the magnitude difference of sn @xmath53 .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath54 and assume that @xmath55 follows a @xmath56 distribution in order to derive confidence limits on the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath57 . in the present analysis , we use results at two different redshifts ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , and combine the two by adding the values of @xmath55 . it is this step , combining the likelihoods at two different redshifts , which constrains the amount of additional dispersion ( or the change in the shape of the magnitude distribution ) due to grey dust between low and high redshifts .",
    "contours of @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ( the difference in @xmath55 from its minimum value ) , representing @xmath60 and @xmath61 intervals of joint confidence , are plotted in figure  4 .",

    "0.1 in [ fig : mlcontour ]    figure  4 shows that the smoothest distribution of dust easily accomodates enough extinction to reconcile a non - accelerating ( @xmath64 ) or flat ( @xmath65 ) universe , as there is a strong degeneracy between the cosmological magnitude shift and dust extinction .",
    "the other cases , where dust traces metals and @xmath66 , are coincidentally quite similar .",
    "such a distribution of dust would be mildly disfavored in a non - accelerating open universe and ruled out at @xmath67 confidence in an einstein - de - sitter universe .",
    "the constraints arise mostly due to the shape of the distribution ; the fact that the observed dispersions are similar at @xmath18 and @xmath19 is relatively unimportant , only making a noticeable difference in panel ( a ) where the shape is similar to the observed distribution .",
    "we have found that current sne datasets appear to have some power to constrain grey dust models .",
    "we find it somewhat unlikely ( at the @xmath68 level ) that sufficient grey dust could be distributed in the relatively clumpy fashion expected for the metal distribution ( c.f . ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) to reconcile the @xcite data with a non - accelerating universe .",
    "this suggests that any substantial grey dust component must be largely segregated from the galaxies where it was formed . in the specific grey dust model of @xcite , sputtering does destroy dust more effectively in denser regions , but once in the igm the large grains have long lifetimes , so that dust is still likely to trace the metals .",
    "the question of how the dust and metals are distributed can be answered self - consistently by modelling the relevant physical processes ( dust and metal ejection from galaxies ) directly in the simulations ( e.g. , aguirre et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "there are many alternative explanations for sne appearing dimmer in the past .",
    "for example , there may be metallicity effects in the host galaxy ( @xcite ) , intrinsic evolution ( @xcite ) , observational selection differences between ccds used for distant sne and photographic plates used for nearby samples ( @xcite ) , or time evolution of the gravitational constant ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such effects would alter the interpretation of our parameter @xmath33 .",
    "gravitational lensing magnification ( @xcite ) would also change the magnitude dispersion at higher redshifts .",
    "the study we have presented is reasonably general , in that our analysis is not dependent on the ( unknown ) microscopic properties of this hypothetical intergalactic dust . still , there are some possible systematic uncertainties , which we now consider .",
    "we assume ( as do @xcite ) that the observed dispersion in sne magnitudes in excess of the estimated observational errors is an intrinsic property of sne and does not vary with redshift .",
    "one could envision scenarios in which the intrinsic dispersion is lower at high redshift , thus allowing more dispersion from dust .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , most of the statistical power of our analysis comes from the _ shape _ of the distributions , which is not significantly affected by a change in the intrinsic dispersion . also , we find that when we decrease the intrinsic sn dispersion ( @xmath69 ) , models with more dust fit slightly better at high-@xmath26 , but the low-@xmath26 fit becomes worse , a trade - off which means that the overall results hardly change .",
    "the distribution shape depends on our assumption that the intrinsic dispersion has a gaussian distribution in magnitudes , whereas a distribution skewed to fainter magnitudes could weaken our constraints . with a larger sample of low - z sne we might be in a position to test this , by using the distribution of low - z sn magnitudes to make a simulated high - z sample with the correct intrinsic distribution shape .",
    "also , we have made a simplifying approximation in our simulated high - z samples , by using dust extinction magnitudes that result from integrating the dust contribution from @xmath70 to exactly @xmath19 .",
    "the real sne are at a range of redshifts ; our constraints are effectively conservative because of this .",
    "we have also assumed that the total mass of dust does not change with redshift from @xmath19 to @xmath70 ; dust increasing with time would strengthen our constraints , while a decrease seems implausible . finally , the truncation of our simulated magnitude distribution at @xmath71 mag is a rather approximate procedure .",
    "we have tried changing the cutoff , and find that with none ( an unrealistic case ) the constraints become stronger , as we might expect . with a lower cutoff , the right side of the observed distribution is not reproduced .",
    "one additional degree of freedom would involve changing the functional form of the cutoff . in the future ,",
    "as observations improve , we plan to simulate such observational selection effects more carefully .",
    "on the simulation side , our relatively low mass resolution ( @xmath72 ) means that we miss fluctuations in the extinction that occur on smaller mass scales .",
    "if we had higher resolution , this should have the effect of making our dust constraints tighter .",
    "we find that the dispersion in projected magnitudes largely depends on _ small _ scale fluctuations .",
    "we tested this by splitting the simulation into small sub - volumes and then shuffling them to remove large scale correlations ( see e.g. , @xcite ) before projection , and we obtained similar results . changing",
    "the assumed cosmological model could have some effects , although it is difficult to conceive of models which have less power on small scales while fitting other constraints ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the models of @xcite have grains that do produce some reddening , typically in the infrared .",
    "a complementary approach to ours is therefore to use information from different color bands .",
    "such an approach was used by @xcite , for example , to constrain normal galactic - type dust .",
    "recent near - ir observations by @xcite have made reddening constraints tight even for non - standard large dust grains .",
    "our approach does not make any use of color information , and so constrains the most extreme scenario in which the dust is totally `` grey '' .    in summary",
    ", we have used cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to explore how intergalactic grey dust could affect observations of high redshift supernovae , and how supernova data can constrain grey dust extinction .",
    "we conclude that only a fairly smooth distribution of dust could readily mimic the effect of an accelerating universe .",
    "such a distribution would be strange , as the dust would be strongly biased away from metal producing regions .",
    "more realistic dust distributions are mildly disfavored , but upcoming samples of sne ( at current redshifts ) should enable us to put tighter limits as they more precisely determining the shape of the brightness distribution . at higher redshifts ( @xmath73 ) , grey dust predicts that sne should show increased dimming , while decreased dimming would be strong evidence for a cosmological constant ."
