    "<S> the free energy at the saddle - point can be expanded self - consistently in powers of @xmath60  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a mean - field expansion shows a continuous transition at @xmath61 which we identify as a crude mean - field limit of the transition in the absence of @xmath62 for @xmath63 or @xmath64 . in order to include the additional interactions </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a cluster expansion ( where the extra terms are proportional to @xmath65 where @xmath66 ) to calculate the gibbs potential in a perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath62 and ultimately , it takes the form  @xcite @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the prefactor @xmath68 is positive for values of @xmath69 less than a critical value and becomes negative for larger values . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of more terms result in a renormalization of this critical value where the multicritical point exists to lower values . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the method is such that we can not identify exactly @xmath70 as the multicritical point , nevertheless the change of the transition from second to first order can be explained .    in conclusion , we investigated the phase transition between a columnar crystal and a coulomb liquid in a 3d dimer system . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that attractive perturbations which respect the symmetries of the original hamiltonian drive the transition first - order . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the interactions are repulsive , the transition becomes continuous , seemingly in a different universality class than the one found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but a more extensive study is required to characterize appropriately the nature of the transition . in this way </S>",
