    "the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite has detected high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in x - ray binaries .",
    "they are kilohertz ( khz ) and hectohertz ( hhz ) qpos in neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries , and high - frequency ( hf ) qpos ( @xmath0 hz ) in black - hole x - ray binaries .",
    "hf qpos occur at fixed frequencies and the appearance is correlated to the state of the sources , that is , they appear only in high - luminosity states where @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the eddington luminosity .",
    "they are suggested to be phenomena originating in a strong gravitational field , which occur in the innermost region of the relativistic disk .",
    "hf qpos are regarded as being a powerful tool to explore the mass and spin of the central black hole , and also to explore the physical states of the innermost region of the accretion disk .",
    "various models have been proposed to explain hf qpos .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite pointed out the importance of resonant processes as being the cause of hf qpos . in their model ,",
    "hf qpos are the result of resonant couplings between the vertical and horizontal epicyclic oscillations at a particular radius .",
    "there is , however , uncertainty concerning the excitation process of the oscillation system as a whole .",
    "( ) proposed a model where hf qpos are regarded to be disk oscillations resonantly excited in deformed disks .",
    "the deformation considered is a warp or an eccentric disk deformation in the equatorial plane .",
    "an outline of the model is as follows .",
    "a non - linear coupling between a disk oscillation ( hereafter , an original oscillation ) and a deformed part of the disk ( warp or eccentric deformation ) causes some forced disk oscillations ( hereafter , intermediate oscillations ) .",
    "the intermediate oscillations make a resonant coupling with the disk , and then feedback to the original oscillation .",
    "since the nonlinear feedback process involves a resonance , the original oscillation is amplified or damped .",
    "there are two kinds of resonances , i.e. , horizontal resonance ( lindblad resonance ) and vertical resonance .",
    "when the deformation is a warp , the resonance that can excite p- and g - mode oscillations is the horizontal resonance (  ) .",
    "hence , in this paper we consider the horizontal resonance alone . in the keplerian disks this resonant process works only when the disk is general relativistic .",
    "that is , a non - monotonic radial distribution of epicyclic frequency is necessary for the appearance of resonance and for trapping of oscillations .",
    "recently , @xcite generalized s idea on the excitation of trapped g - mode oscillations and made detailed numerical calculations of the growth rates of the oscillations in the case of rotating black holes .",
    "their results indicate that the coupling mechanism can provide an efficient excitation of trapped g - mode oscillations , provided that the global deformations reach the inner part of the disk with non - negligible amplitude .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider nearly the same problem examined by @xcite , following the formulation by  ( ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to make comparison of results obtained from two different approaches , s fully numerical approach and s analytical one .",
    "we especially consider the case where the disk is warped . in section 2",

    "this difference is likely to result from the difference between our analytical approach and their numerical one .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : growth ] shows that the growth rate increases with increasing warp amplitude .",
    "this is natural , since the oscillations are excited by having the interaction with the warped disk .",
    "@xcite discussed that the growth rate should grow with @xmath181 for small @xmath58 , because the excitation consists of two processes : i ) the interaction giving rise to the intermediate oscillation and ii ) feeding back to the original oscillation .",
    "in fact , their numerical results , which are for @xmath182 , agree with this argument .",
    "our model , however , provides significantly flatter dependance of the growth rate on the warp amplitude than that obtained by @xcite .",
    "this may be explained as follows : from the real and imaginary parts of equation ( [ eq : kato35 ] ) , we see that if @xmath136 was fixed , both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath183 , i.e. , @xmath174 and @xmath184 , would be proportional to the coupling terms , which are proportional to the warp amplitude , @xmath58 .",

    "instead , it leads to a dependence flatter than @xmath186 as shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : growth ] .    from the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : growth ] , we can see the dependence of the growth rate on the spin parameter of the black hole for a fixed sound speed ( @xmath189 ) . the growth rate increases with increasing spin parameter .",
    "this spin dependence of the growth rate will be due to a similar reason as that in the case of @xmath152-dependence .",
    "that is , as the spin parameter increases , the warp rapidly oscillates in the radial direction in the inner region of the disk , since the difference between @xmath190 and @xmath191 is large there [ see equation ( [ eq : solwarp ] ) ] .",
    "let us assume tentatively that @xmath136 is unchanged from the value of the case of a small spin parameter .",
    "then , the intermediate oscillations have a large amplitude with a short wavelength , since the coupling terms have radial derivative of @xmath131 [ see equation ( [ eq : ar+ ] ) and ( [ eq : aphi+ ] ) ] .",
    "this means that the condition ( [ eq : w+exp1add2 ] ) [ or ( [ eq : w+exp1add3 ] ) ] can not be satisfied . for the condition to be satisfied in the case of a large spin parameter , @xmath176 must increase so that the amplitude of the intermediate oscillations decreases until the magnitude of @xmath158 becomes comparable with that of the case of a smaller spin parameter value .",
    "this will be a reason why the growth rate increases with an increase of the spin .",
    "the result regarding the @xmath169-dependence of growth rate qualitatively agrees with those obtained by @xcite for the fundamental g - mode oscillations .",
    "note that for @xmath192 case , we found that there is no excitation of the fundamental g - mode oscillation .",
    "we have numerically studied the excitation of trapped g - mode oscillations in warped disks around black holes , based on a scenario proposed by  ( ) .",
    "we first obtained trapped g - mode oscillations with eigenfrequencies close to the maximum of the horizontal epicyclic frequency .",
    "then , we examined whether these modes are excited via the resonant coupling with the warp of the disk .",
    "we have found that the fundamental modes of the trapped g - modes are excited except in the case of non - rotating black holes .",
    "we have performed calculations of the growth rate of the fundamental mode for some parameter values such as the warp amplitude in the inner radius , the isothermal sound speed in the disk and the black hole spin parameter .",
    "we have found that the growth rate increases as the warp amplitude and spin parameter increases or the sound speed decreases .",
    "the dependence of the growth rate on these parameters qualitatively agrees with that obtained by @xcite for the fundamental mode , but quantitatively there are significant differences between the two .",
    "we suspect that these differences are due to differences of the model considered .",
    "our results presented in this paper show that the excitation of trapped g - mode oscillations by global disk deformation is rather sensitive to the disk structure , because the resonant radius given by @xmath193 and a characteristic radius of the oscillation where @xmath194 or @xmath195 has a peak are close .",
    "we also suppose that the damping ( or amplification ) of the intermediate oscillations at the corotation resonance is not an essential ingredient for the excitation of disk oscillations in deformed disks . in the next paragraphs",
    ", we discuss the excitation mechanism from a viewpoint of energy flow among oscillations .",
    "energy flow between original and intermediate oscillations occurs at two aspects of the resonance .",
    "the first occurs at the stage where the oscillation resulting from nonlinear coupling between the original oscillation and the warp acts as a forcing source on the intermediate oscillation .",
    "the second occurs at the feedback process from the intermediate oscillation to the original oscillation where the intermediate oscillation acts as a source to the original oscillation after coupling with the warp .",
    "the net energy input rate to the original oscillation through these coupling processes is given by equation ( [ eq : kato12 ] ) .",
    "the results derived from this equation show that in a simplified situation the signs of wave energy of original and intermediate oscillations must be opposite for excitation of the original oscillation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that a physical cause of resonant excitation of disk oscillations in deformed disks is an interaction of two waves with different signs of the wave energy at a resonant radius (   : @xcite ) . in the present case ,",
    "the original oscillation is axisymmetric and has positive energy , i.e. , @xmath196 .",
    "hence , a necessary condition for wave amplification to occur is a negative wave energy of the intermediate oscillation .",
    "the major process of excitation is thus a positive energy flow from the intermediate oscillation with negative energy to the original oscillation with positive energy at the resonant region . by this energy flow ,",
    "both original and intermediate oscillations grow",
    ".    the main role of the warp will be a kind of catalyzer for energy transport . in equation ( [ eq : kato12 ] )",
    ", energy exchange between the oscillation and the disk in the resonant region will be involved , but it will be subsidiary in the present excitation mechanism . if the intermediate oscillation has an interaction with environment and its negative wave energy is transferred to the environment , the oscillation has a tendency to be damped .",
    "however , a negative energy will be transported to the intermediate oscillation from the original one to replenish the loss . then",
    ", the original oscillation will be excited more strongly than that in the case of absence of such negative energy loss from the intermediate oscillation .",
    "this is the case considered by @xcite .    here",
    ", a brief comment is necessary on the procedure adopted in this paper to evaluate the growth rate .",
    "our procedure is based on the fact that the growth rate can be calculated by using @xmath197 given by equations ( [ eq : kato1336 ] ) and ( [ eq : kato1437 ] ) . with these equations ,",
    "we need not to solve an inhomogeneous wave equation for the original oscillations . in other words , the inhomogeneous wave equation to be solved by taking into account",
    "the resonant effects is only that of intermediate oscillations , as we have done in this paper .",
    "this is justified by comparing terms in equations ( [ eq : kato1336 ] ) [ or equation ( [ eq : kato1437 ] ) ] as follows .",
    "let us , for example , consider @xmath198 as a typical term in the integrand of equation ( [ eq : kato1336 ] ) ( the subscripts @xmath93 and @xmath199 are omitted for simplicity ) .",
    "the term consists of @xmath200 . if the effect of resonant processes on the original oscillation is neglected",
    ", @xmath201 is purely imaginary , i.e. , @xmath202 [ see equations ( [ eq : ar+ ] ) or ( [ eq : ar- ] ) ] .",
    "then , @xmath203 .",
    "this is nothing but the case we have treated in this paper . if the effect of resonant processes on the original oscillation is taken into account , however , a real part of @xmath201 appears , i.e. , @xmath204 .",
    "then , the problem to be considered here is whether the term @xmath205 is of importance in evaluating @xmath154 .",
    "the term is , however , found to be smaller than @xmath206 in magnitude by the following reasons .",
    "@xmath207 is non - zero , but smaller than @xmath208 in magnitude , since it is a small correction term of @xmath201 introduced by the resonant processes .",
    "hence , the term @xmath209 is negligible compared with @xmath210 , unless @xmath211 is much larger than @xmath212 in magnitude .",
    "the results in this paper show that @xmath211 and @xmath212 are of the same order in the resonant region ( see figures  [ fig : intosc ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath209 can be safely neglected compared with @xmath210 . in conclusion ,",
    "when we calculate the growth rate by using @xmath139 , the inhomogeneous wave equation that should be considered is only that for the intermediate oscillations , as we have done in this paper .",
    "the results of this paper as well as those of @xcite confirm that the resonant excitation process of disk oscillations in deformed disks work to excite trapped oscillations .",
    "the excitation process is thus one of the most promising causes of the observed high frequency qpos .",
    "the trapped g - mode oscillations themselves , however , can not account for the observed characteristic that high frequency qpos often appear in pairs with frequency ratio close to 3:2 .",
    "furthermore , in the case of khz qpos in neutron - star low - mass x - ray sources , the frequencies of qpos vary with time .",
    "to describe such observational characteristics by the present disk oscillation models , it might be necessary to relax the restriction of trapping , i.e. , consideration of non - trapped oscillations might be necessary , as ( , ) did .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for invaluable comments , which greatly helped us improve the paper .",
    "fo thanks masayuki fujimoto for helpful discussions .",
    "she also acknowledges the scholarship from ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology .",
