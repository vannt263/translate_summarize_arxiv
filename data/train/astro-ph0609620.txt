    ", we will next examine the origin of this relation .",
    "we focus on the importance of preferential metal loss versus low sf efficiency at low masses in producing the mzr .",

    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows _",
    "y@xmath27 _ for our galaxies , derived again using inner cold gas abundances , versus the total baryonic mass of our galaxies at z=0 ( black circles ) .",
    "the effective yields reproduce the observed trend from t04 ( solid line ) over most of our mass range .",
    "our two lowest mass galaxies have _ y@xmath27 _ below that found by @xcite , likely because these two have undergone additional tidal stripping of gas .",
    "the black circles in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show the baryonic to dark mass ratio ( b / dm ) of our galaxies , normalized by the cosmic ratio ( the seven satellite galaxies have been excluded from this panel ) . in our simulations , large deviations below b",
    "/ dm = 1 can only be produced by mass loss .",
    "our lowest mass galaxies have lost up to 98% of their baryonic mass .",
    "using the halos defined by ahf ( our halo finder ) , we identify a given halo and its gas particles back to z=3 . once all the gas particles that have ever belonged to a galaxy back to z=3 are identified , those particles that are no longer within the virial radius at z=0 are considered to be gas `` lost '' from the galaxy .",
    "the grey points in both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] represent this information , for all gas ( remaining + lost ) .    when we include all of the gas lost since z = 3",
    ", we find that our low mass galaxies still have b / dm that fall significantly below the cosmic ratio .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show that our lowest mass galaxies have lost 50 - 90% of their baryons prior to z = 3 .",
    "we verify that a uv only simulation ( sne feedback turned off ) removes up to 80% of baryons from our lowest mass galaxies , but that these galaxies evolve as closed boxes once sf commences .",
    "we thus find that sne induced mass loss can account for up to 20% of baryon loss from galaxies with m@xmath1 @xmath2 1@xmath1810@xmath3 m@xmath4 . additional gas loss can occur via tidal stripping .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] clearly demonstrates that gas has been preferentially lost from our lowest mass galaxies , and that this gas loss is responsible for the observed _ y@xmath27_-m@xmath1 trend .",
    "however , when all gas ( remaining + lost ) is used to rederive the mzr ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the observed trend that lower mass galaxies have lower metallicities still exists , and it can not be mass loss alone that causes the mzr .      as explained above , the mass loss experienced by our lowest mass galaxies can not account for the overall _ m@xmath0-z _ trend seen in fig .",
    "we now investigate whether sf efficiencies can explain the origin of this trend .",
    "if lower mass galaxies convert gas into stars less efficiently than higher mass galaxies , then they will require a much longer period of time to enrich the remaining gas to the same metallicity as higher mass galaxies .",
    "this effect can lead to the observed mzr , with or without mass loss as an additional contributor .",
    "we verified that all of our galaxies follow the schmidt - kennicutt law for sf @xcite .",
    "our galaxies span a factor of 250 in gas surface densities , yielding a sfr that varies by over three decades from our lowest to highest mass galaxies .",
    "our lowest mass galaxies are thus incredibly inefficient at sf compared to our high mass galaxies .",
    "the consumption rate ( sfr / m@xmath29 ) of our lowest mass galaxies is about two decades lower than our highest mass galaxies .",
    "that is , while our highest mass galaxies will use up all their gas in 1 gyr or less , our lowest mass galaxies will take up to 60 gyr if they continue sf at their current rate .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the gas mass fraction , _",
    "f@xmath6 _ , versus rotational velocity for our galaxies ( satellite galaxies excluded ) . as found by recent observations of isolated galaxies ,",
    "lower mass galaxies have increasing gas fractions , implying that lower mass galaxies have been less efficient at making stars . note that while the lowest mass galaxies in our sample have lost more than 90% of their baryons",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , they remain gas rich due to their low sf efficiencies ( with the exception of two that have been tidally stripped of much of their gas ) .",
    "we reran our simulations without sne feedback . in our models , without this feedback the mzr is flat because low mass galaxies experience unrealistically high sf rates , resulting in an overproduction of metals .",
    "this difference with the runs that do include sne demonstrates that energy injection by sne into the ism regulates sf efficiency , independent of whether sne also lead to mass loss .",
    "sne feedback thus indirectly affects the shape of the mzr by modulating the gas surface densities , and hence the sfr , with galaxy mass .",
    "fig .  [ fig3 ] shows that our simulated galaxies at z=2 are less evolved than their z=0 counterparts , with z=2 galaxies being much more gas rich at a given rotational velocity than at z=0 . by z=0 ,",
    "they have consumed more of their gas , increasing both their stellar mass and o abundance ; hence the evolution of the mzr as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "both s05 and e06 examined the mzr at z@xmath100.7 and z@xmath102 , respectively , and drew conclusions similar to ours .",
    "as pointed out by s05 and @xcite , at a given metallicity the high z data are about an order of magnitude more massive than the z=0 trend ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that more massive galaxies enrich at a faster rate than lower mass galaxies .",
    "this is supported by our results in section  [ sfe ] .",
    "both s05 and e06 conclude that the evolution of the mzr is best described by a model in which low mass galaxies are inefficient at sf relative to high mass galaxies for a similar formation epoch .",
    "thus the period of sf is lengthened in lower mass galaxies and they remain more gas rich at a given redshift .    we find that a shift downward by 0.3 dex in @xmath26log(o / h ) from fit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is an excellent fit to our z=2 data , as was also found by e06 .",
    "a shift in @xmath26log(m@xmath0 ) is much too steep to match our simulations .",
    "thus , we find that the slope of the mzr remains relatively constant with redshift , but the normalization increases with time .",
    "we have presented results from high resolution simulations of field galaxies in a @xmath8cdm context .",
    "the simulations are carried to z=0 and include sf and a physically motivated description of the effects of sne feedback and metal enrichment .",
    "we have shown in previous work ( g06 ) that this approach leads to disk galaxies that fall on the tf and baryonic tf relations and reproduce the age - mass relation of disk galaxies and abundance of galaxy satellites . here",
    "we present a natural extension of this analysis , showing that the simulated galaxies are also in excellent agreement with the observed mzr both at z=0 and z=2 .",
    "simulated galaxies match both the slope and normalization of the mzr over four orders of magnitude in stellar mass .",
    "we find that the slope of the mzr is roughly constant with redshift , but that its normalization increases with time .",
    "such evolution agrees with the high - z observations of e06 , and with early theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mass scales of the turnovers in our simulated _ z _ , _ y@xmath27 _ , b / dm , and _ f@xmath6 _ versus mass relations are in good agreement with a range of previous observational and theoretical studies that find critical transitions at @xmath10120 km / s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "baryon loss due to sn feedback results in a _ y@xmath27_-m@xmath1 trend in agreement with the results from the sdss ( t04 ) .",
    "however , including gas that has been lost from galaxies does not alter the o abundances significantly , and does not change the overall shape of the mzr , confirming that the lower o abundances in our low mass galaxies are primarily due to their low sf efficiencies rather than directly to blowouts .",

    "sn feedback plays a crucial role in lowering the sf efficiency in low mass galaxies and originating the turnover in the mzr at the observed scales . without energy injection from sne to regulate sf , gas that remains in galaxies rapidly cools , forms stars , and increases the o abundance , even by z=2 ( see g06 for additional shortcomings of the no feedback case ) . with feedback from sne",
