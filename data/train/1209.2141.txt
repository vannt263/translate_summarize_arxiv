    "the physical parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the bending and saddle splay modulus , with units of energy .",
    "the remaining two parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are lagrange multipliers fixing the membrane area @xmath16 at some value @xmath17 and its enclosed volume @xmath18 at a value @xmath19 .",
    "while it is simple to write down the energy , the nonlinear field theory associated with it is not simple .",
    "thus , unless the membrane lends itself to a description in terms of a height function which varies slowly above some simple geometry , it will tend to be necessary to examine its behavior numerically . on occasion ,",
    "the symmetries of the theory allow one to circumvent this necessity .",
    "in this paper , a stratagem exploiting the conformal symmetry of the bending energy will be used to provide an exact analytical description of a local deformation that is established in an almost spherical vesicle when two neighboring points are brought into contact .",
    "consider two closely separated points on an almost spherical vesicle . the obvious way to bring the two together is to apply tangential forces . in the geometric approximation",
    "there is no penalty associated with surface shear on a fluid membrane , and , thus the two points can be brought together this way without deforming the membrane .",
    "it is also possible , however , to apply forces normal to the surface , with appropriate torques , in such a way that the points remain separated on the surface but are brought together in space .",
    "an illustration of this process is shown in fig .",
    "these forces can be directed in or out of the vesicle .",
    "views of the corresponding deformed vesicles at the end point of this process are shown in figs . [ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](c ) .",
    "we show a close - up of the local behavior of the vesicle in figs . [ fig2](b ) and [ fig2](d ) .",
    "+    the surprise is that , even though the membrane undergoes large deformations in a neighborhood of the two points under the influence of the force , an exact description of this final state exists . in this state ,",
    "the external forces are horizontal , and the torques about the point of contact vanish .",
    "this description is a happy accident of the conformal invariance of the two - dimensional bending energy @xcite .",
    "in contrast , neither the initial state , nor any of the intermediate states in the sequence before contact is made , involving nontrivial external forces and torques , lend themselves to an analogous treatment .",
    "while this state may represent an idealization from a physical point of view , and developing an experimental protocol to construct it will provide its own challenges , it is nonetheless a genuine nonperturbative feature of the mesoscopic description of fluid membranes , and it does provide unexpected access to the nonlinear response of fluid membranes to external forces .",
    "constraints would typically be expected to break the full conformal invariance of the bending energy . however , the contact constraint associated with the end state is invariant under conformal transformations ( in particular , it does not introduce an additional length scale ) .",
    "fixing the area will restrict the invariance group to the subgroup of area conformal transformations .",
    "as we will see , conformal transformations preserving the area of the equilibrium surface are described by two parameters .",
    "likewise , their counterparts preserving volume will be characterized by two - parameters . simultaneously constraining the area and",
    "the volume restricts the invariance group to a smaller subgroup : characterized by a single parameter . a variational argument showing that the multipliers vanish under these circumstances",
    "is provided in [ appcic ] .",
    "axially symmetric membrane states with two poles brought together were constructed a few years ago @xcite .",
    "this was done by exploiting the fact that any state related by inversion in a sphere to any equilibrium state will also be an equilibrium state . in particular , states described by inversion of a catenoid  an axially symmetric infinite cylindrical surface growing exponentially at its two ends",

    "nearby points on the surface get inflated into a large spherical region .",
    "a very different closed vesicle is obtained : spherical almost everywhere , with a localized defect  held together by a force dipole  illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , sitting at one of its poles .",
    "any one of these equilibrium configurations will have a particular area , @xmath17 , and a particular volume , @xmath19 . since it is a stationary state of the unconstrained energy",
    ", it will also be a stationary state of the constrained energy in which the area and volume are constrained to be @xmath17 and @xmath19 . by construction",
    ", it will satisfy the new constraints .",
    "if the center of inversion lies just outside the catenoid , the local geometry of the defect resembles a flat sheet with two fingers of membrane  touching at a point pushed up from below , a valley forming beneath them , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the point of inversion lies just inside , the exterior resembles a flat sheet that has been pinched into self - contact ; a ridge forms above the two points that have been brought into contact , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , not unlike the wrinkle that is formed in skin that has been pinched together between two fingers .",
    "locally , these two geometries are identical ; one is the other viewed from below : the interior of the defect represented in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) is indistinguishable from that represented in fig . [",
    "fig2](c ) .",
    "a feature of this geometry is that a well defined tangent plane exists at the two points of contact .",
    "this is consistent with a logarithmic singularity in the curvature at these two points . in this construction , these singularities originate in the compactification of the exponential ends @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the minimal surface thus completely determines the geometry at the center of the defect .",
    "the conformal symmetry of the bending energy provides a connection between the weak - field harmonic behavior of the catenoid at infinity , described accurately by perturbation theory , and the nonlinear behavior of the defect at its center .",
    "this correspondence is a general feature of field theories exhibiting an underlying conformal symmetry .",
    "the focus here , for simplicity , will be on mirror symmetric states , generated by placing the point of inversion on the mirror plane containing the waist of the catenoid",
    ". the scale is set by fixing the area ; finger - like and pinch - like almost - spherical symmetric states are characterized uniquely by the geodesic distance @xmath0 separating the two points along the surface which , in turn we will see , is determined by the fixed volume .",
    "thus , if both area and volume are fixed , there is a unique symmetric state of each kind . in a future publication",
    ", the breaking of the mirror symmetry will be explored @xcite . even though the total energy will be independent of the distance separating them along the surface ,",
    "the degree of localization of the energy density will depend on this distance .",
    "what is more , we will show that if the forces and torques are fixed , this state will be energetically stable , whether the perturbation breaks the symmetry or not .",
    "this means that there are no negative eigenvalues in the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "unless the configuration is a sphere , it will have a different ratio of @xmath20 than a sphere does , so it can not be transformed into a sphere by energy , volume , and area preserving transformations .",
    "there will , however , be a zero mode of the energy associated with conformal transformations that preserve both the vesicle area and its volume .",
    "this zero mode breaks the mirror symmetry between the two poles .",
    "if the constraint on the volume is relaxed , a second zero mode appears . for symmetric states",
    ", this corresponds to changing the geodesic distance between the poles . under these circumstances",
    ", there is a path connecting the defect state to a sphere with @xmath21 , the same energy and the same area ; because the defect state has the same topology as a sphere , it is not protected topologically .",
    "such a mode would allow the membrane to slip out of the defect .",
    "the normal force tying the points together provides a source of stress in the membrane .",
    "if these forces were removed , the membrane sheet would collapse into one of the equilibria of a fluid membrane described , for axially symmetric vesicles , in refs . @xcite and @xcite . in the absence of the volume constraint",
    "this would be a featureless spherical state , the only unconstrained equilibrium geometry with this topology .",
    "it is these forces that establish the defect geometry and , thus , the tangent planes along which the molecules forming the fluid membrane may flow . in the absence of an appropriate zero mode , the vesicle can not slip out of the defect .",
    "the stress finds itself concentrated in the neighborhood of the two points ; it is also completely captured by the defect geometry .",
    "the curvature singularities in this geometry are associated with these localized external forces and manifest themselves as divergences in the stress .",
    "the strength of these forces is registered by an appropriate integral of the stress along a contour encircling one of the points . as we will demonstrate",
    ", it is also possible to evaluate them exactly by deforming the contour to exploit the symmetry of the problem . unlike the energy , they vary inversely with the distance @xmath0 between the two points measured along the surface . the same argument",
    "can be tweaked to show that the external torques about these points vanish .",
    "conformal invariance also permits an exact analytic description of the inhomogeneous and anisotropic distribution of stress established in the membrane in the fully non - linear theory .",
    "this is the first instance  to our knowledge  of such a description in any non - trivial fluid membrane geometry .",
    "three qualitatively different regimes are identified : the neighborhood of the singularities within the fingers , the valley that extends under them , and the far region . while a global description of the surface in terms of a height function does not exist , in each of these three regions it is possible to describe the surface in terms of its height above an appropriate plane , and to compare the exact stress tensor with its counterpart in the small gradient biharmonic approximation . in particular , it will be shown that , whereas near the singularities the geometry behaves as a biharmonic monopole , in the valley it behaves as a surface of constant mean curvature , and far away it behaves as a biharmonic quadrupole .",
    "characteristic distributions of stress are found to be associated with each region ; both near the poles as well as asymptotically , radial tension is accompanied by an equal lateral compression .",
    "a crossover from tension to compression is encountered in the region between the poles .",
    "consider a catenoid , with unit neck radius , aligned along the @xmath22 axis .",

    "@xmath35 is dimensionless in our construction .",

    "the two planar ends of the catenoid , represented by the neighborhood of the points at infinity @xmath39 get compactified to a single point , the origin of the euclidean plane , @xmath40 . because the center of inversion lies on the catenoid , the neighborhood of this point is mapped to infinity .",

    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) ( or viewed below as fig . [ fig2](d ) ) .",
    "this does not , of course , represent a defect on a vesicle of fixed finite surface area .",
    "but it is simple to tweak the construction to do so : by moving the center of inversion off the catenoid , its neighborhood on the catenoid get compactified into a sphere .",
    "if this point is located close to the neck , the vesicle geometry will approximate an almost round sphere with the defect located at its north pole .",
    "geometries corresponding to a point of inversion lying both outside as well as inside the catenoid are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](c ) .",
    "notice in particular that the distance between the two points , as measured along the surface , is small compared to the radius of the sphere . as we will quantify below , the local defect geometry in an almost - spherical vesicle is accurately described by a center of inversion lying on the catenoid itself . to describe the defect geometry in greater detail , first note that its geometry possesses @xmath41 and @xmath42 as mirror planes : the former is what remains of the axial symmetry and the latter is the unbroken mirror symmetry of the catenoid .",

    "<S> the volume constraint fixes the distance @xmath0 , measured along the surface , between the two points ; if it is relaxed , a second zero mode appears , reflecting the independence of the energy on @xmath0 ; in the absence of this constraint a pathway opens for the membrane to slip out of the defect . </S>",
    "<S> logarithmic curvature singularities in the surface geometry at the points of contact signal the presence of external forces . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of these forces varies inversely with @xmath0 and so diverges as the points merge ; the corresponding torques vanish in these defects . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry behaves near each of the singularities as a biharmonic monopole , in the region between them as a surface of constant mean curvature , and in distant regions as a biharmonic quadrupole . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the distribution of stress with the quadratic approximation in the height functions points to shortcomings of the latter representation . </S>",
    "<S> radial tension is accompanied by lateral compression , both near the singularities and far away , with a crossover from tension to compression occurring in the region between them .    _ </S>",
