    "the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation @xmath1 is a simplified model equation for waves at the surface of a fluid contained in a rectangular channel .",
    "the equation includes the competing effects of nonlinear steepening and frequency dispersion @xcite .",
    "balancing these two effects is the basic mechanism behind the existence of both solitary - wave solutions and periodic travelling waves .",
    "equation is given in dimensional form , @xmath2 is the limiting long - wave speed , @xmath3 denotes the undisturbed water depth , and @xmath4 is the gravitational constant of acceleration .",
    "the function @xmath5 describes the deflection of the fluid surface from the rest position at a point @xmath6 at time @xmath7 .",
    "the equation is a valid approximation describing the evolution of surface water waves in the case when the waves are long compared to the undisturbed depth @xmath3 of the fluid , the average amplitude of the waves is small when compared to @xmath3 and in addition , transverse effects are assumed to be weak @xcite .",
    "the linear phase speed in the kdv equation is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wave number , and @xmath10 is the wavelength .",
    "this is a second - order approximation to the wave speed @xmath11 of the linearised water - wave problem .",
    "the latter expression for @xmath12 appears when the full water - wave problem is linearised around the vanishing solution , and solutions of the form @xmath13 are sought @xcite .",
    "comparing the expressions and , it appears that the linearised kdv equation does not give a faithful representation of the full dispersion relation even for intermediate values of the wave number @xmath14 . recognising this problem of the kdv equation as a model equation for water waves , whitham introduced what is now called the whitham equation @xcite",
    "the idea was to use the exact form of the wave speed instead of a second - order approximation like .",
    "the equation proposed by whitham has the form @xmath15 where the convolution is in the @xmath6-variable .",
    "the equation is written in dimensional variables , with @xmath5 representing the deflection of the surface from rest , just as in the kdv equation .",
    "the convolution kernel is defined via the fourier transform @xmath16 by @xmath17 it should be mentioned that the whitham equation has excited some interest because it was conjectured to feature wave breaking and peaking .",
    "wave breaking in this context is defined as the development of an infinite gradient in the solution . in a physical context",
    ", this kind of breaking may not happen naturally for a free equation such as , but may require some forcing either by a sloping bottom , or an imposed discharge @xcite . while the kdv equation does not allow the formation of infinite gradients , it features convective wave breaking which is related to spilling at the wavecrest @xcite .",
    "wave peaking describes the situation where a steady wave profile features a singular point , such as a peak or a cusp , such as in the well known highest wave which was conjectured to be peaked by stokes , and proved to exist in @xcite .",
    "both the existence of peaked and breaking waves were investigated to some degree already by whitham @xcite , and studied at length for a number of related equations by naumkin and shishmarev in the monograph @xcite .",
    "recently , proofs of both phenomena have become available . in particular , it was shown in @xcite that the whitham equation features waves which develop an infinite gradient , and the existence of a highest , peaked wave was proved in @xcite .    in the present article ,",
    "the whitham equation is studied in the case when surface tension is important .",
    "the motivation for this pursuit lies partially in the analysis in @xcite where it was shown that the whitham equation is a valid model for surface waves of smaller wavelengths than the kdv equation . as a result",
    ", it is possible to use the whitham equation for surface waves which are short enough for capillary effects to play a role . on the other hand , there are situations where capillarity is strong , such as in the presence of a surface film or an interfacial hydrate layer @xcite . in this case",
    ", capillarity can be important even for longer waves .    in the general case where both capillary and gravity effects are present , the relation between the wavenumber @xmath14 and the radial frequency @xmath18 in the linearised surface water wave problem is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the density of the fluid , and",
    "@xmath21 is the surface tension of the free surface .",
    "if restricted to waves propagating into a single direction , the phase velocity can be written as @xmath22 thus in the case of capillary - gravity waves , this definition of @xmath12 is used in the definition of the integral kernel in . if the undisturbed depth @xmath3 is taken as a unit of length , and @xmath23 is taken as unit of time , then the whitham equation with surface tension is @xmath24 where the integral kernel @xmath25 is given by its fourier transform , viz .",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 is the bond number which measures the relative strength of capillary and gravity effects on the wave motion .",
    "in particular , for @xmath28 one recovers the purely gravitational case .",
    "note that this equation is completely different in structure from the capillary kdv equation @xmath29 this latter equation reduces to the case of the kdv equation with the sign of the dispersive term being positive or negative depending on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "since these two cases are equivalent via a change of sign , they do not differ in a qualitative way @xcite .",
    "the one case of greater interest is when the bond number @xmath0 is close to @xmath30 as a fifth - order term is then needed in order to get the correct order of approximation .",
    "the resulting equation is known as the kawahara equation , and it features competing third and fifth order derivatives . on the other hand ,",
    "equation features two competing nonlocal terms for any value of the bond number @xmath0 , and as will be seen presently , this configuration has repercussions on the possible solutions of the equation .    in the present work ,",
    "steady solutions of are under consideration and we will look for solutions in the space of continuous @xmath31-periodic functions , which will be denoted by @xmath32 . for convenience , we use a further rescaling to put in the tidy form @xmath33 and then use the assumption @xmath34 to search for travelling wave solutions with propagation speed @xmath35 . the equation",
    "can then be written in integrated form as @xmath36    as will be shown in the body of this article , with the definition of @xmath25 in , equation features a large variety of solutions . in particular , there are branches which contain secondary bifurcation points leading to connections with other branches .",
    "there are also crossings of distinct branches without connections , and there are self - crossing ( but not intersecting ) bifurcation branches .",
    "such patterns have been seen before in some cases , such as in the case of tri - modal surface water waves ( @xcite ) , but the nature of the connections appears to be different in the present case .",
    "the existence of crossing and self - crossing branches leads to non - uniqueness of solutions of the steady problem which is an interesting problem in itself .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ secbifurcationformulas ] ,",
    "analytic bifurcation formulae are provided in order to guide the numerical experiments . in section [ scheme ] , the numerical scheme is explained in detail , and in section [ secresults ] , numerical experiments are shown .",
    "we now want to provide an analytical expansion of the wave profile and speed near the bifurcation point . we look for an expansion in the form @xmath37 in this pursuit , it is important to understand the behaviour of the dispersion relation in terms of different values of the bond number @xmath0 .      analysing the linearised version of",
    ", it is intuitively clear that given @xmath38 , the speed at which non - trivial @xmath31-periodic solutions bifurcate from the trivial solution curve is given by @xmath39 and the kernel of @xmath40 at the bifurcation point is the span of @xmath41 . a firm proof of this fact can be established in the same way as it was shown for the purely gravitational case in @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that for @xmath28 , equation is monotonically decreasing in @xmath42 , while it has a global minimum for any value of @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , @xmath44 for @xmath45 , while for @xmath46 the minimum is 1 and @xmath47 is monotonically increasing in @xmath42 . some examples are shown in figure [ figbifurcationspeed ] .",
    "this means that given two wavenumbers @xmath48 , we can always find a @xmath0 such that @xmath49 , and hence the two branches bifurcate from the same point .",
    "such @xmath0 is given by @xmath50    note that this implies that for @xmath51 , the kernel of @xmath40 is two - dimensional at the bifurcation point , and in particular the kernel is the span of @xmath52 .",
    "this fact , along with the existence of local _ sheets _ of solutions , is outside of the scope of the present paper , but will be rigorously proved in future work .      in the case of a one - dimensional kernel , i.e. when",
    "@xmath53 , the constants in formulas and are given below :    rcl u_1 & = & ( kx ) , + u_2 & = & + ( 2kx ) , + u_3 & = & ( 3kx ) , + u_4 & = & a_0 + a_2k ( 2kx ) + a_4k(4kx ) .",

    "+    for the expansion of the wave speed @xmath35 , we have    rcl _ 0 & = & m(k ) , + _ 1 & = & 0 , + _ 2 & = & + , + _ 3 & = & 0 .    note that these expansions coincide , up to the second order in @xmath54 , with the bifurcation formulas given in @xcite .    due to formula there",
    "exist some values of @xmath0 for which the above expansion is not valid , e.g. when @xmath55 . in those cases",
    "a more in - depth analysis is required .",
    "however , since all the terms in the denominator are of the form @xmath56 , the expansions and remain valid also when @xmath57 provided @xmath58 . in the other cases , we can still select @xmath0 in order for and to hold while making the coefficients in a component @xmath59 arbitrarily large .",
    "this explains the existence of multi - modal waves , which are associated with the property that the bifurcation kernel can be two - dimensional .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , tri - modal waves were found in the case of the full - water wave problem with a background shear current .",
    "several examples are presented in section [ secresults ] .",
    "due to equation it is natural to use the wave speed as a bifurcation parameter , and we are interested in the shape of curves of nontrivial solutions close to the bifurcation point .",
    "this information is given by the expansion for the wave speed except in the cases of a two - dimensional kernel .    in the purely gravitational case we know that any nontrivial branch has a vertical tangent at the bifurcation point . this is due to the fact that @xmath60 , and as we have have just shown it is preserved also in the capillary case .",
    "moreover , for gravity waves it was shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.6 ) that the main branch ( k=1 ) satisfies @xmath61 , which means that in a neighbourhood of the bifurcation point the main branch will go to the left , in the direction of decreasing velocities . due to the effect of @xmath0 on @xmath47",
    ", we can see from the above bifurcation formulas that there are values of @xmath0 for which @xmath62 changes sign , and therefore the main branch can bifurcate going to the right , in the direction of increasing velocities .",
    "the value of @xmath63 is plotted in figure [ figconcavity ] for the first four wavenumbers .",
    "note that the branches for @xmath64 , among others , bifurcate going to the right also in the purely gravitational case .",
    "we employ a variation of the method presented in @xcite . we want to apply a fourier - collocation method , which is convenient given the definition of @xmath65 .",
    "also note that , thanks to symmetry , we can perform all computations on the half - wavelength @xmath66 .",
    "given @xmath42 , let @xmath67 be the total number of collocation points and define the subspace of @xmath68 @xmath69 and the collocation points @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "we then discretise equation and search for a solution @xmath72 , @xmath73 such that @xmath74 to understand the term @xmath75 , we need to see how @xmath65 acts on functions in @xmath76 , therefore we expand @xmath77 in its discrete fourier ( cosine ) series : @xmath78 where as usual @xmath79    we then see that @xmath65 acts on @xmath77 as follows : @xmath80      & = \\int k(y ) \\sum_{n=0}^{n-1}w_n\\,a_n\\ ; { { \\textstyle \\frac{e^{i(nx - ny)}+ e^{-i(nx - ny)}}{2 } } } \\;\\mathrm{d}y.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now split the integral in the two parts , change variables @xmath81 in the second integral , and exploit the fact that @xmath65 is even , and get that the above becomes @xmath82      & = \\sum_{n=0}^{n-1 } w_n\\,a_n\\,\\cos(nx)\\;{\\textstyle \\sqrt { \\frac{(1+tn^2)\\tanh(n)}{n}}}. \\intertext{expanding the definition of $ a_n$ and rearranging the sums we finally have}\\\\[-12pt ]      & = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{n=0}^{n-1 } w_n^2 \\;{\\textstyle \\sqrt{\\frac{(1+tn^2)\\tanh(n)}{n}}}\\;\\cos(nx_i)\\cos(nx ) \\ ; u_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so if we define the matrix @xmath83 as @xmath84 we have that the above is transformed into the matrix - vector multiplication @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the vector @xmath87 $ ] whose entries are the discrete solution evaluated at the collocation points .",
    "we can therefore collocate equation in the collocation points @xmath88 , and obtain a system of @xmath67 nonlinear equations @xmath89      problem requires solving a nonlinear system of equations , written in general from as @xmath90 .",
    "this can be done with standard newton iterations @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the jacobian of @xmath93 .",
    "choosing different @xmath93 s allows to parametrise the problem in different ways , depending on what is most convenient at any given time .",
    "we present here two possible strategies to parametrise and follow the bifurcation branch : one is based on parameter - continuation , while the other is based on the pseudo - arclength method .",
    "the idea of a parameter - continuation approach consists in choosing a quantity @xmath94 to be the parameter , it can be for example the speed of the wave , and then in setting @xmath93 so that a solution to @xmath90 will satisfy as well as a constraint linked to the parameter we have chosen .",
    "once a solution is found , the parameter is updated by a small step @xmath95 and a new solution is computed .",
    "looking at , the most natural choice seems to be @xmath96 which corresponds to using the speed as a parametrisation of the branch .",
    "we can picture the branch as a curve plotted in the @xmath97 plane , where @xmath98 can be any other quantity used as vertical axis , e.g. the wave height .",
    "given a fixed speed @xmath99 and a corresponding solution @xmath100 of , we modify the speed with a small step @xmath101 and use the previous solution @xmath100 as an initial guess for newton .",
    "the algorithm will then `` move '' vertically from the point @xmath102 and converge to a new solution on the branch with speed equal to @xmath101 . while this is very robust numerically",
    ", it clearly breaks down when the curve has a turning point or a vertical tangent , as then the implicit function theorem no longer applies .",
    "since we already know that nontrivial branches have a vertical tangent at the bifurcation point , and that turning points may happen , we want to include other types of parametrisations .",
    "since @xmath35 can no longer be used as a parameter , it needs to be treated as an unknown , and consequently we must include an additional equation in the system .",
    "one idea would be to use the waveheight as a parameter , and we can identify the numerical wave height as @xmath103 . we will then choose @xmath93 to be @xmath104 where @xmath105 .    while this is convenient in case of turning points or vertical tangents in the branch , it is based on the assumption that @xmath103 really describes the wave height , i.e. that @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the crest and the trough of the wave .",
    "as we have seen , however , there are cases where the wave can be multimodal , and therefore crests may not be positioned at @xmath106 .",
    "see for example figure [ fig1and7d ] .",
    "when this happens , this parametrisation will not give any control on the height of the wave , and may make it difficult to accurately follow the branch .    a third option that can be used is to parametrise the curve with the square of the @xmath108-norm of the solution .",
    "this results in a choice of @xmath93 as @xmath109          \\frac{1}{n}(u_1 ^ 2 + u_2 ^ 2 + \\ldots u_n^2 ) - \\textsc{l2 }      \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] where as before @xmath110 .",
    "our strategy in the parameter - continuation setting is to perform the first few iterations along the branch using the discrete @xmath108-norm parametrisation , then switch to . at every step we control the conditioning of the jacobian of the parametrisation in use , and when it exceeds a certain tolerance we switch to a different parametrisation .",
    "another continuation method that can be used is the pseudo - arclength , which is a _ predictor - corrector _ scheme based on the idea that a natural parametrisation for a curve is the arclength .",
    "let @xmath111 $ ] . given a solution @xmath112 on the branch , we compute the next solution @xmath113 in three steps :",
    "first we compute the tangent vector @xmath114 at @xmath112 solving @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "the first of is the tangency condition , while the second is used to choose the tangent vector with the correct orientation .",
    "then , given @xmath117 ( properly normalised ) we compute @xmath118 , _ predictor _ point to @xmath113 , simply by @xmath119    finally , the new point @xmath113 is found by projecting @xmath118 onto the branch in a direction perpendicular to @xmath117 .",
    "that is , we obtain @xmath113 by solving @xmath120 which is the _ corrector _ step of the method .",
    "this method is surprisingly robust , and enables us to easily follow the branch even in presence of turning points .",
    "it is clear , however , that it requires an initial guess for the first tangent vector @xmath121 .",
    "the last @xmath67 components of @xmath121 can be chosen , according to what was said in section [ secbifurcationformulas ] , as @xmath122 .",
    "for the first component the optimal choice would be to use the information coming from ; however as we have noted that expansion is not always valid . in order to circumvent this problem and obtain information on the `` direction '' for the speed",
    ", we decided to first use the parametrisation , which returns some value @xmath123 as a solution , and then simply set the first component in @xmath121 as @xmath124 .",
    "we present in this section the numerical results we obtained applying the scheme presented earlier .",
    "all results have been obtained employing the pseudo - arclength parametrisation described in section [ secpseudoarclength ] . for notational simplicity",
    "we will refer to the branch obtained for @xmath125 as the _ main _ branch even in the presence of multi - modal waves .",
    "the computed profiles have been tested in a discrete time integrator in order to ascertain their validity as numerical solutions of the whitham problem . to this end , a fully discrete time dependent collocation scheme was developed which is similar to the scheme used in @xcite .",
    "while a detailed discussion of the time integration scheme and corresponding results is beyond the scope of this work , we note that well posedness of a class of nonlocal equations was proved in @xcite , and convergence of spectral collocation projections of similar nonlocal equations was proved in @xcite , so that this discussion is therefore omitted here .",
    "figure [ figallbranches ] presents the plots of the branches for @xmath126 , for the same values of the capillarity parameter @xmath0 as considered in figure [ figbifurcationspeed ] .",
    "note that in the purely gravitational case @xmath28 , figure [ figall0 ] , we took advantage of the known theoretical result stating that @xmath127 . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no similar result is available for the capillary case , hence in figures [ figall01 ] , [ figall02 ] , and [ figall0333 ] we are showing the branches up to the wave height value of @xmath128 , in order to keep the plots readable .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the code can continue the branches also after those heights , and in particular we are able to continue the branches well over heights of 1 . in several cases we tested the highest computed profiles in the time integrator and",
    "let the profile evolve for several periods ; all tested waves resulted to be orbitally stable .",
    "however , these waves may still feature modulational instability , such as discussed in @xcite for the purely gravitational whitham equation and a more general class of equations in @xcite .",
    "we also briefly note here that waves high up in the branches may have very steep profiles , which in turn makes the time evolution error very sensitive to the stepsize used .",
    "we present one such example in figure [ figalmostcuspedwave ] .    to the naked eye",
    "the plot of the profile can appear so steep that it seems to almost develop cusps of depression .",
    "from the theory it is clear that any solution of the whitham problem has to be smooth , in particular @xmath129 , so cusps can not really develop , but this may be an indication of a possible blow - up in the derivative .",
    "going back to figure [ figallbranches ] we see that , as expected , the bifurcation speed of the branches increases with @xmath0 and for @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "we can also see that the branches bifurcate in the direction of increasing or decreasing velocities in accordance with section [ secconcavity ] ( see also figure [ figconcavity ] ) .",
    "moreover , we note that turning points are present also in the capillary case : see for example the branch for @xmath132 in figure [ figall01 ] .",
    "section [ secconnectingbranches ] contains a more detailed discussion of the complex interaction happening between the main branch and the branch for @xmath133 that can be seen in figure [ figall01 ] .",
    "this section is devoted to the cases where @xmath0 is chosen as in . for these values we know from section [ secbifurcationformulas ] that the bifurcation kernel is two - dimensional and the analytical expansions with the coefficients given in [ secexpansioncoeffs ] may no longer be valid .",
    "also , as will be proved in future work , the two - dimensional bifurcation kernel leads to the existence of two - dimensional _ sheets _ of small amplitude solutions .",
    "our code , however , is currently capable of following only _ branches _ of solutions . in the case of a two - dimensional kernel , this corresponds to following the intersection curve between the sheet of solutions and the plane @xmath134 .",
    "figure [ fig2dim-1 - 7 ] shows the plot for the branches for @xmath135 and @xmath136 when @xmath137 .",
    "note that the profiles of the waves at the points labelled ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) are shown in the corresponding subfigures . in this case",
    "the bifurcation kernel is spanned by @xmath138 and the branches bifurcate from the same point as expected .",
    "as we can see the main branch contains waves with mixed wavenumbers : at the beginning ( figure [ fig2dim-1 - 7b ] ) waves have simple cosine - like profiles , but further up the branch ( figure [ fig2dim-1 - 7c ] ) the influence from the @xmath139 component becomes more pronounced and they develop 7 crests .",
    "this change happens somewhat rapidly in the lower part of the branch , while in the higher part the profiles seem to stabilise to a mix of @xmath140 and @xmath139 , and little change in shape is observed between waves even over great distances in the branch .",
    "the waves in the @xmath141 branch , on the other hand , maintain a pure @xmath139-profile throughout the branch .",
    "changing @xmath0 with the help of we can produce two - dimensional kernels containing any @xmath142 and @xmath141 : figure [ fig2dim-1 - 2 ] shows a case similar to the above for the wavenumbers @xmath135 and @xmath143 .",
    "note that since now @xmath144 , the expansion formulae with the coefficients written in section [ secexpansioncoeffs ] are no longer valid , and in particular we see that the @xmath142-branch does not have a vertical tangent at the bifurcation point .",
    "as in the previous case , the main branch contains mixed waves : in the lower part the principal mode is @xmath140 , while as one follows the branch the contribution from the @xmath145 mode becomes noticeable and the profile develops two crests .",
    "the profile of waves in the @xmath141 branch , instead , is not affected by the lower @xmath142-mode and remains of the form @xmath145 .",
    "this fact is clear from a functional - analytical point of view since @xmath146 , the space of continuous , @xmath147 periodic functions , is a subset of @xmath148 .    more generally , if @xmath149 for some @xmath150 , then @xmath151 and the @xmath142-branch will contain solutions with components mixing the wavenumbers @xmath142 and @xmath141 . if instead @xmath141 is not an integer multiple of @xmath142 , @xmath152 and therefore the @xmath142 branch will not contain any component with period @xmath153 : see for example figure [ fig2dim-3 - 4 ] .",
    "the numerical tests show that it is still possible for the @xmath142-branch to include period - halving components , which will lead to the formation of two new crests in place of the original ones .",
    "looking at the coefficients in section [ secexpansioncoeffs ] it is clear that the height on the branch where this will happen is proportional to @xmath154 , but anyway there will not be components with pure @xmath141 wavenumbers .      in this section",
    "we explore in more detail the cases where the @xmath142 branch actually connects to the @xmath141 one .",
    "a first example could already be seen in figure [ figall01 ] , where the main branch connects to the @xmath133 branch .",
    "we will look at this case in detail , and briefly present other cases later .",
    "when @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath155 , we have seen in the previous section that the two branches bifurcate from the same point .",
    "we can therefore view the bifurcation point as a point of connection between these two branches .",
    "looking at figure [ fig2dim-1 - 7 ] we see that the main branch lies on the right and above the @xmath156-branch ; however we know from formula and figure [ figbifurcationspeed ] that with an increase in @xmath0 , @xmath157 will increase faster than @xmath158 .",
    "we therefore expect the representations of the two branches in the wavespeed - waveheight plane to _ cross _ each other at a certain point .",
    "the question now is : can we make the two branches _ connect _ , i.e. can we make small variations in @xmath0 such that there still exists a point ( which was originally at @xmath159 ) where the two branches share the same wave ?",
    "the answer in general is yes , provided a multiplicity condition on the wavenumbers is fulfilled .",
    "figure [ fig1and7 ] shows the plots for @xmath135 and @xmath136 , with @xmath160 .",
    "recall from before that @xmath161 so now we have @xmath162 .",
    "closeup pictures of the connection point are presented in figure [ fig1and7closeup ] .",
    "as expected , the main branch now starts to the left and below the @xmath141 branch , and near the point labelled ( c ) , they cross each other without connecting since they do not share the same solution at that point . very similarly to what we have seen in section [ sec2dim ] , the profile of the wave starts as @xmath140 right after the bifurcation point , then loses monotonicity ( figure [ fig1and7c ] ) and rapidly develops seven crests ( figure [ fig1and7d ] ) .",
    "the further we go up the branch the more evident is the presence of a `` carrier '' signal like @xmath140 and a high frequency modulation given by the @xmath139 component : see figure [ fig1and7e ] .",
    "the main branch then curves and connects to the @xmath156 one : figure [ fig1and7closeup ] shows two close - ups of the connection point . while approaching the @xmath156 branch , the main branch crosses itself twice but does not self - intersect .",
    "after that it also crosses the @xmath156 branch , then turns back and actually connects to it ; the connection point being the left one in figure [ fig1and7closeup3 ] .",
    "near that point we see that the profiles are essentially identical ( figures [ fig1and7-connection1 ] and [ fig1and7-connection7 ] ) . after the connection the main branch separates again and moves up , forming a loop ( figure [ fig1and7a ] and closeup in figure [ fig1and7b ] ) before continuing in the direction of increasing heights .",
    "again , there is no self - intersection in the loop , but only a crossing .",
    "after the connection point with the @xmath141 branch , the profiles in the main branch are flipped vertically and the contribution from the @xmath139 component diminishes until it reaches a situation like the one presented in figure [ fig1and7f ] .",
    "the profiles remain essentially unchanged in shape further up in the branch .",
    "it is possible to replicate the above picture using any @xmath142 provided @xmath141 is chosen as @xmath163 in particular , our numerical experiments show that if @xmath164 is odd , and hence @xmath141 is an odd multiple of @xmath142 , then the lower - mode branch connects with the higher one , but after the connection it continues and is unbounded as we can see in the previous figure [ fig1and7a ] .",
    "if instead @xmath164 is even , then the @xmath142 branch terminates at the connection point and no further solutions are found : see figure [ figotherconnections ] .",

    "<S> the so - called whitham equation arises in the modeling of free surface water waves , and combines a generic nonlinear quadratic term with the exact linear dispersion relation for gravity waves on the free surface of a fluid with finite depth .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> the effect of incorporating capillarity into the whitham equation is in focus . </S>",
    "<S> the capillary whitham equation is a nonlocal equation similar to the usual whitham equation , but containing an additional term with a coefficient depending on the bond number @xmath0 which measures the relative strength of capillary and gravity effects on the wave motion .    </S>",
    "<S> a spectral collocation scheme for computing approximations to periodic traveling waves for the capillary whitham equation is put forward . </S>",
    "<S> numerical approximations of periodic traveling waves are computed using a bifurcation approach , and a number of bifurcation curves are found . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis uncovers a rich structure of bifurcation patterns , including subharmonic bifurcations , as well as connecting and crossing branches . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for some values of the bond number @xmath0 , the bifurcation diagram features distinct branches of solutions which intersect at a secondary bifurcation point . </S>",
    "<S> the same branches may also cross without connecting , and some bifurcation curves feature self - crossings without self - connections . </S>"
