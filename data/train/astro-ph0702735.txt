    "it has been known for a long time that the typical peculiar space velocities of pulsars are an order of magnitude larger that those of their progenitors  the massive stars ( e.g. gott , gunn & ostriker 1970 ) .",
    "subsequent proper motion measurements for pulsars suggested that some of them could be very fast objects , with peculiar speeds of up to @xmath2 ( e.g. chatterjee & cordes 2004 ; hobbs et al .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed for the origin of high - velocity pulsars .",
    "the first one involves the disruption of tight ( semidetached ) massive binary systems following the second ( symmetric ) supernova explosion ( e.g. blaauw 1961 ; iben & tutukov 1996 ) .",
    "this mechanism , however , can not produce velocities in excess of @xmath3 ( portegies zwart & van den heuvel 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , the high - velocity pulsars formed in this way are the remnants of the first supernova explosion and therefore should be _ recycled _ , i.e. their spin characteristics should be significantly affected by the stellar wind of the companion star  the progenitor of the second supernova ( cf .",
    "chatterjee et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the second mechanism relies on a natal kick ( caused by the asymmetry of the supernova explosion ; e.g. shklovskii 1970 ; dewey & cordes 1987 ) or on a post - natal acceleration ( caused by the asymmetric electromagnetic or neutrino emission from the newborn pulsar ; e.g. tademaru & harrison 1975 ; chugai 1984 ) . in principle",
    ", this mechanism can produce solitary high - velocity pulsars with ordinary spin - down characteristics , i.e. non - recycled pulsars ( e.g. scheck et al . 2006 ) .",
    "thus , detection of non - recycled pulsars moving with a velocity @xmath4 would suggest that the mechanism involving the binary disruption by the supernova explosion does not apply to all cases . in the following we refer to pulsars ( neutron stars ) moving with velocities of @xmath5 as ` hyperfast pulsars ' ( a term introduced by chatterjee et al . 2005 ) .",
    "until recently the best candidates for hyperfast pulsars were psr b2224 + 65 ( associated with the well - known guitar nebula ; chatterjee & cordes 2004 ) and psr b2011 + 38 ( see hobbs et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) , whose peculiar velocities ( both @xmath6 ) were inferred on the basis of proper motion measurements and dispersion measure distance estimates .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the distance estimates , however , leave a possibility that these velocities are overestimated .",
    "recent proper motion and parallax measurements for the pulsar psr b1508 + 55 gave the first example of a high velocity ( @xmath7 ) directly measured for a ( non - recycled ) pulsar ( chatterjee et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this result proved the existence of a population of hyperfast neutron stars , and implies that the peculiar velocity of psr b1508 + 55 can not be solely due to the disruption of a tight massive binary system . a possible way to account for the high velocity",
    "is to assume that at least part of this velocity is due to a natal kick or a post - natal acceleration ( chatterjee et al . 2005 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative explanation for the origin of hyperfast pulsars ( cf .",
    "gvaramadze 2007 ) .",
    "we suggest that psr b1508 + 55 ( as well as other hyperfast neutron stars , provided that the distance to these objects is @xmath8 kpc . ] ) could be the remnant of a symmetric supernova explosion of a high - velocity massive star ( or its helium core ) which attained its peculiar velocity ( similar to that of the pulsar ) in the course of a strong three- or four - body dynamical encounter in the core of the parent young massive star cluster ( ymsc ) .",
    "our suggestion is based on the fact that massive ( @xmath9 ) star clusters are still forming in the disk of the milky way ( see sect.[sec : ymsc ] ) and on the hypothesis that the cores of some ymscs harbour intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , i.e. black holes ( bhs ) with masses ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( see sect.[sec : ymsc ] ) .",
    "our suggestion also requires the existence of very dense stellar environment ( @xmath12 ) to ensure that three- or four - body dynamical encounters are frequent ( see sect.[sec : hfp ] ) .",
    "although such high densities may exist during the core collapse of ymscs , we caution that they have never been observed ( we discuss this problem in sect.[sec : ymsc ] ) . in sect.[sec : hvs ] , we briefly discuss the mechanisms for the origin of hypervelocity stars , the recently discovered class of stars moving with a speed of @xmath13 , and suggest that similar mechanisms ( although acting in a different environment ) could be responsible for the origin of some of the hyperfast neutron stars . in sect.[sec : hfp ] , we estimate the maximum possible velocities of high - velocity escapers produced by various dynamical processes in the cores of ymscs . in sect.[sec : sim ] , we compare these estimates with results from numerical simulations while in sect.[sec : disc ] we discuss the ability of these processes to explain the origin of hyperfast pulsars .",
    "the discovery of high velocity pulsar psr b1508 + 55 ( chatterjee et al . 2005 ) coincided with the discovery of the hypervelocity stars to designate the ordinary stars moving with a peculiar speed of @xmath14 while for neutron stars we reserve the term ` hyperfast ' ( see sect.1 ) . ]",
    "( brown et al . 2005 ; edelmann et al 2005 ; hirsch et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the existence of the latter was predicted by hills ( 1988 ) , who showed that a close encounter between a tight binary system and the supermassive bh in the galactic centre ( e.g. ghez et al .",
    "2003 ; schdel et al .",
    "2003 ) could be responsible for the ejection of one of the binary components with a velocity of up to several @xmath15 ( see also hills 1991 ) .",
    "yu & tremaine ( 2003 ) proposed two additional possible mechanisms for the production of hypervelocity stars .",
    "the first one involves close encounters between two single stars in the vicinity of a supermassive bh ( the probability of this process , however , is very low and we will not discuss it further ) while the second one is based on the interaction between a single star and a putative binary bh in the galactic centre ( e.g. hansen & milosavljevi 2003 ) .    the discovery of hypervelocity stars ( brown et al .",
    "2005 ; edelmann et al . 2005 ; hirsch et al . 2005 ; brown et al .",
    "2006 ) provides support for models of ejection mechanisms involving dynamical processes in the vicinity of the supermassive bh ( gualandris , portegies zwart & sipior 2005 ; baumgardt , gualandris & portegies zwart 2006 ; bromley et al .",
    "2006 ) , and now it is widely believed that these high - velocity objects originate in the galactic centre ( see , however , edelmann et al .",
    "2005 ; see also sect.[sec : disc ] ) .",
    "it is , therefore , possible that some hyperfast pulsars ( or their progenitor stars ) were also ejected from the galactic centre .",
    "for example , one of the hypervelocity stars is a early b - type star of mass @xmath16 ( edelmann et al .",
    "2005 ) , so that this star will end its evolution in a type ii supernova leading to the production of a hyperfast neutron star .",
    "the proper motion measured for psr b1508 + 55 , however , indicates that this pulsar was born in the galactic disk near the cyg ob associations ( chatterjee et al .",
    "2005 ) , i.e. its origin can not be associated with the galactic centre .",
    "the proper motions of psr b2224 + 65 and psr b2011 + 38 also suggest that these pulsars were born far from the galactic centre .",
    "therefore , one should look for other places in our galaxy where one can find a sufficiently massive bh and where the number density of the local stellar population is high enough to ensure that close encounters between stars and the bh are frequent .",
    "note that the characteristic age of the above mentioned pulsars ( ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath18 myr ) implies that at least these three pulsars were not ejected from the dense cores of globular clusters ( whose typical age is @xmath19 gyr ) and point to the more plausible cites of their origin ",
    "the ymscs .",
    "we note that with the ymscs could be associated another important channel for production of high - velocity stars , namely through close dynamical encounters between stars in their cores .",
    "this process constitutes the base of the dynamical - ejection scenario proposed by poveda , ruiz & allen ( 1967 ) to explain the origin of runaway ob stars .",
    "the most effective path for production of high - velocity stars by stellar encounters is through interaction between two hard binaries ( e.g. mikkola 1983 ; leonard & duncan 1988 , 1990 ) .",
    "this process and processes involving dynamical encounters with imbhs are discussed in detail in sect.[sec : hfp ] .",

    "all but one of these ymscs are located on the near side of the galaxy .",
    "taken together these facts suggest that ymscs are more numerous than it was known hitherto and that many of them are still hidden from observers by the obscuring material in the galactic plane ( kndlseder et al . 2002 ; hanson 2003 ) .",

    "we choose this time - span since we assume that the currently observed hyperfast neutron stars could be the descendants of either a @xmath24 hypervelocity star , ejected at the very beginning of its life , or a stripped helium core of the more massive star , attained its peculiar velocity only recently ( see sect.[sec : hfp ] ) . assuming that the star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath25 , derived by lada & lada ( 2003 ) for embedded star clusters in the solar neighbourhood , is representative for the galactic disk as a whole ( cf .",

    "star clusters in the solar neighbourhood , and assumes a larger upper cut - off of cluster masses , @xmath30 .",
    "we prefere to use the sfr given in lada & lada ( 2003 ) to account for the fact that many embedded star clusters independently of their mass became dissolved within the first @xmath31 yr of their evolution ( a possible example of such a stellar system is the cyg ob2 association ) .    to",
    "the ymscs resided in the disk one should add the ones formed in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "theoretical models of evolution and observability of star clusters within 200 pc of the galactic centre suggest that this region could easily harbour @xmath32 ymscs with properties similar to those of the well - known arches and quintuplet systems ( portegies zwart et al . 2001a , 2002 ) .",
    "recent discovery with 2mass of a large number of cluster candidates in direction to the galactic centre ( dutra et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) supports this suggestion , although follow - up work is required to confirm the nature of these objects .",
    "the dynamical evolution of ymscs is dominated by massive stars , which sink to the cluster centre on a time scale @xmath33 , which typically is smaller than the main - sequence lifetime of these stars .",
    "interestingly , the dynamical friction time - scale is independent of cluster mass , its size and density profile ( e.g. portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ; grkan , freitag & rasio 2004 ) , where @xmath34 is the half - mass relaxation time - scale given by ( spitzer 1987 ) @xmath35 here , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the total mass and the characteristic ( half - mass ) radius of the cluster , @xmath38 is the gravitational constant , @xmath39 is the mean stellar mass , @xmath40 is the number of stars in the cluster and @xmath41 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "for @xmath42 and using eq.([relax ] ) , one has @xmath43    as a result , mass segregation drives ymscs to core collapse .",
    "the consequential increase in the central density may results in runaway stellar collisions during which a massive star continues to grow in mass due to repeated bombardment to a very massive star ( vms ) ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "1999 ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ; grkan et al .",
    "2004 ) , provided that core collapse is completed before the most massive stars in the cluster explode as supernovae , i.e. @xmath44 yr . on this time - scale essentially",
    "all massive ( @xmath45 ) stars in ymscs segregate to the cluster core . for @xmath46 and assuming a @xmath47 salpeter initial mass function ( in this case @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , one has from eq.([cc ] ) that the runaway process occurs in ymscs with @xmath50pc .",
    "the majority of young and massive stars appear to reside in dense embedded clusters with a characteristic radius of @xmath51 pc , which is independent of mass ( kroupa & boily 2002 ) .",
    "it is therefore not unconceivable that an appreciable fraction of ymscs evolve through a collisional stage . the maximum observed density in the cores of ymscs [ e.g. ngc3603 ( harayama et al .",
    "2007 ) , arches ( figer et al . 1999 ) ] is smaller than that required for runaway collisions to occur .",
    "whether or not the discrepancy between the observations and the theory is the result of the small number of known ymscs remains unclear to date .",
    "the consequences of the collisional stage are profound , and we assume here that it may exist at least in some ymscs .",
    "the vms formed through runaway collisions will ultimately collapse to a bh .",
    "one of the main questions here is wheather or not the bh will be massive or not .",
    "the mass of the imbh formed in this way could be as large as @xmath52 for @xmath53 ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "2004 ) , but if the mass loss in the collision product is as high as argued in some calculations ( belkus , van bever & vanbeveren , 2007 ; yungelson 2007 ; yungelson et al 2008 ) the final bh may be @xmath54 .",
    "it is also possible that imbhs of mass @xmath55 are the descendants of old globular clusters disrupted by the tidal field of the galactic disk or that they are formed from the core collapse of massive population iii stars .",
    "later they could be captured gravitationally by molecular clouds or by the already existing young star clusters . in the first case ,",
    "the imbh initiates star formation in the cloud and , therefore , resides at the centre of the newly formed star cluster ( miller & hamilton 2002 ) , while in the second case the imbh rapidly sinks to the centre of the cluster due to the dynamical friction ( miller & colbert 2004 ) .",
    "we now consider the possibility that dynamical processes in the cores of ymscs could be responsible for ejection of hypervelocity massive stars or their helium cores , whose subsequent collapse and ( symmetric ) supernova explosion result in the origin of hyperfast neutron stars ( pulsars ) . in the following subsections",
    ", we estimate the upper limits for the ejection speed produced by encounters involving : ( i ) two hard binaries , ( ii ) a hard binary and an imbh and ( iii ) a single star and a hard binary imbh .      in sect.[sec :",
    "hvs ] , we mentioned that the most effective path for production of high - velocity stars by stellar encounters is through interaction between two hard binaries , either the tidally captured or the primordial ones .",
    "note that the tidal binaries are very hard by definition since the semimajor axes of their circularized orbits are at most a few stellar radii ( e.g. lee & ostriker 1986 ; mcmillan , mcdermott & taam 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that collisions involving tidal binaries play a dominant role in production of the fastest runaway stars .",
    "it is also important to note that due to the mass segregation , the cores of ymscs are over - represented by massive stars , so that most of tidally captured binaries should be the massive ones .",
    "moreover , one can expect that almost all tidal binaries would be massive if the most massive stars are formed near the centres of their parent clusters ( e.g. bonnell , bate & zinnicker 1998 ; cf .",
    "kroupa 2001 ) .",
    "numerical simulations by leonard & duncan ( 1988 , 1990 ) showed that the typical velocities at infinity ( i.e. well after ejection ) of runaway stars ( produced in the course of binary - binary collisions ) are similar to the orbital velocities of the binary components while the velocities of some escapers can be twice as large .",
    "moreover , the maximum possible velocity attained by the lightest member of the binaries involved in the interaction ( e.g. the helium core of a massive star or a early - type b star ) can be as large as the escape velocity from the surface of the most massive star in the binaries ( leonard 1991 ) .",
    "for the upper main - sequence stars with the mass - radius relationship ( habets & heintze 1981 ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the stellar radius and mass , the maximum possible velocity at infinity of ejected stars is a weak function of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and could be as large as @xmath60 ( cf .",

    "leonard 1989 ) @xmath75 it follows from eq.([bb ] ) that the collisional time - scale is short enough ( i.e. @xmath65 yr ) if more than 10 massive binaries exist in the core of radius @xmath76 pc .",
    "assuming that almost all stars more massive than @xmath77 are segregated to the cluster core and exchanged in binaries , one has the minimum mass of the ymsc of @xmath78 .",
    "the recent discovery ( muno et al . 2006 ) of an anomalous x - ray pulsar in the @xmath79-yr old massive ( @xmath80 ) galactic star cluster westerlund1 ( clark et al . 2005 ) implies that the progenitor of this neutron star was a star with a zero - age main - sequence mass @xmath81 ( cf .",

    "maximum velocities are somewhat higher compared to the case of two main - sequence stars ( see fig.[fig : velo ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for a fixed initial semimajor axis , a he star can get much closer to a bh than a main - sequence star .",
    "the fraction of very close encounters , however , is small and the average velocity of escapers is not substantially higher than in the case of main - sequence binaries .      another exciting possibility , discussed in sect.[subsec : bbh ] , is mediated by an encounter between a single star and an imbhb .",
    "we simulate these encounters by considering a single star with a mass of 8@xmath163 and a radius of 3.5@xmath126 and binary components with masses in the range @xmath164 , both in equal- and unequal - mass binaries .",
    "the semimajor axis is fixed to @xmath165 in all cases and the relative velocity at infinity between the single star and the centre of mass of the imbhb is set to @xmath133 , as in the previous case .",

    "the vast majority of the encounters result in a fly - by . with",
    "the random choice of impact parameter adopted in the code ( see mcmillan & hut 1996 ; portegies zwart 2001a ) , typical recoil velocities in such large distance encounters are modest .",
    "the distribution of recoil velocities is strongly peaked at small velocities ( @xmath166 ) but shows a long tail towards large velocities ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "the ejection velocities of escapers depend sensitively on how close the single star approaches the imbhb during the encounter .",
    "high - velocity ejections are realized only if the star approaches the binary within a distance comparable to the binary separation .",
    "the maximum ejection velocity for this scenario is achieved when the incoming star passes through the binary system , very close to one of the bhs .",
    "the distance of closest approach is limited only by the tidal radius in the gravitational field of the black hole , which is roughly given by @xmath168 .",
    "the fraction of encounters resulting in velocities larger than @xmath148 increases from about 8 per cent for bhs of @xmath169 to 20 per cent for bhs of @xmath140 .    in order to prove the critical dependance of the ejection velocity at infinity of escapers on the distance of closest approach to the imbhb",
    ", we perform another set of simulations with zero impact parameter .",
    "the values of the bh masses adopted in each set of simulations are reported in table[tab : bbh ] , followed by the average velocity at infinity for escapers , the velocity @xmath152 for which 1 per cent of the encounters have @xmath155 and the percentage of encounters for which the escapers achieve a recoil velocity larger than @xmath148 computed over 5000 scattering experiments for each set of parameters .",

    "the maximum velocities should be considered as lower limits , as the actual value depends on the random sampling of the initial conditions in the scattering experiments . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results shown in table[tab : bbh ] show that very large velocities can be achieved in close encounters between a single star and a massive bh binary .",
    "encounters with impact parameters close to zero are , none the less , very rare and we conclude that interactions between a stellar binary and a single massive bh are more likely to result in the ejection of an hypervelocity star .",
    "in this paper , we explored the hypothesis that the hyperfast pulsars could be the remnants of a symmetric supernova explosion of a high - velocity massive star which attained its peculiar velocity ( similar to that of the pulsar ) in the course of strong dynamical three- or four - body encounters in the cores of ymscs .",
    "we estimated the maximum velocities obtainable in these encounters and found that they are comparable to those measured for hypervelocity stars .",
    "we therefore argue that the origin of hypervelocity stars could be associated with dynamical processes in the cores of ymscs .",
    "such star clusters are expected to be much more common than hitherto assumed ( see sect[sec : ymsc ] ) .",
    "hypervelocity stars could also originate from other star - forming galaxies .",
    "the position in the sky , the age and the observed velocity of the hypervelocity star he0437@xmath1705439 suggests that it was ejected from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) rather than from the milky - way galaxy ( edelmann et al .",
    "recently , gualandris & portegies zwart ( 2007 ) investigated this hypothesis by simulating interactions between a binary and an imbh in a young star cluster in the lmc and found that the hypervelocity star he0437@xmath1705439 could have been accelerated by one of the young star clusters in the lmc , but this would require an imbh of @xmath171",
    ".    the cores of globular clusters may also give rise to ejecting stars and millisecond pulsars with high speed , in particular , those globular clusters which have a high central density and are rich in recycled pulsars .",
    "some globular clusters may even harbour an imbh , which are known to be able to produce hypervelocity stars , and those clusters form a natural channel for production of solitary millisecond pulsars , whose velocities , in principle , can reach very high values .    in sect.[sec",
    ": hfp ] and sect.[sec : sim ] , we show that main - sequence o - type stars can not be ejected from ymscs with a peculiar velocity sufficiently high to explain the origin of hyperfast neutron stars ( unless a @xmath172 imbh is present in the cluster center ) , but lower mass main - sequence stars or stripped helium cores could be accelerated to hypervelocities .",
    "we find also that dynamical processes in the cores of ymscs can produce stars moving with velocities of @xmath173 , which are typical of pulsars ( e.g. hobbs et al . 2005 ) and the bound population of halo b - type stars ( ramspeck , heber & moehler 2001 ; brown et al . 2007 ) , and therefore can contribute to the origin of pulsar velocities in addition to asymmetric supernova explosions and disruption of binaries following supernova explosions ) .",
    "but even in these cases the cross - section for producing such high speeds is small and we expect that only a fraction of high - velocity runaways have been accelerated by this mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , some of velocities observed for pulsars may be explained by the proposed scenario . even though we present the cross - sections for scattering processes discussed in sect.[sec : hfp ] and sect.[sec : sim ] , it is still hard to estimate the production rate for the proposed mechanism .",
    "the main uncertainty at the moment is in the number and characteristics of the population of young and massive star clusters .",
    "we argue also that some fast moving neutron stars could be the descendants of hypervelocity helium cores , which due to their short lifetimes ( @xmath174 yr ) can only have been ejected quite recently . as a consequence , the neutron star should not have had time to travel a long distance from its parent star cluster .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath8 myr old pulsar psr b1508 + 55 is indeed the remnant of a hypervelocity star , then the pulsar separation from the galactic plane of @xmath175 kpc implies that its progenitor was a helium core ( cf .",
    "gvaramadze 2007 ) .",
    "the hypervelocity main - sequence stars of mass @xmath176 ejected at large angles to the galactic plane end their lives at distances @xmath177 kpc and thereby contribute to a population of halo and intergalactic supernovae .",
    "the proper motion vectors of several pulsars located in the high - pressure interiors of their associated snrs show a trend ( ng & romani 2004 ) toward alignment with the pulsar rotation axes ( inferred from the symmetry of toroidal nebulae surrounding the pulsars ) .",
    "this trend could be understood if pulsars receive at birth a kick directed along their rotation axes . the observed alignment , however , is not perfect .",
    "it is clearly pronounced only for the vela pulsar .",
    "a natural explanation of the misalignment ( if one adopts that _ all _ neutron stars are kicked along their rotation axes ) is that the supernova progenitor star had an arbitrarily oriented peculiar velocity , comparable with or larger than the kick velocity received by its descendant at birth .",
    "one possibility is that the supernova progenitor was a member of a binary system and that the pulsar peculiar velocity is in part due to the recoil received by the system after the first supernova explosion .",
    "another possibility is that the progenitor star was ejected from the parent ymsc due to the processes discussed in sect.[sec : hfp ] .",
    "thus , the hyperfast pulsars produced by supernova explosion of hypervelocity stars should not show any alignment between their spin axes and proper motion vectors .",
    "this inference , however , would be difficult to prove since the hyperfast pulsars leave rapidly from the confines of their parent snrs [ on a time - scale of @xmath178 yr , where @xmath179 is the pulsar peculiar velocity in units of @xmath180 , @xmath181 is the supernova energy in units of @xmath182 erg , and @xmath183 is the number density of the ambient interstellar medium ] .",
    "the only known hyperfast neutron star associated with a snr ( rx j0822@xmath1704300 in puppisa ; hui & becker 2006 ; winkler & petre 2007 ) is a radio - quiet object ( gaensler , bock & stappers 2000 ) that makes it impossible to infer the direction of its rotation axis .",
    "one can also infer the orientation of the pulsar rotation axis using the radio polarization measurements ( e.g. deshpande , ramachandran & radhakrishnan 1999 ; johnston et al .",
    "as expected , the proper motion of the hyperfast pulsar psr b1508 + 55 shows a large misalignment of @xmath184 ( or @xmath185 , depending on whether or not the linear polarization of the pulsar radio emission is parallel or orthogonal to magnetic field ; see chatterjee et al .",

    "<S> recent proper motion and parallax measurements for the pulsar psr b1508 + 55 indicate a transverse velocity of @xmath0 , which exceeds earlier measurements for any neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - down characteristics of psr b1508 + 55 are typical for a non - recycled pulsar , which implies that the velocity of the pulsar can not have originated from the second supernova disruption of a massive binary system . the high velocity of psr b1508 + 55 can be accounted for by assuming that it received a kick at birth or that the neutron star was accelerated after its formation in the supernova explosion . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an explanation for the origin of hyperfast neutron stars based on the hypothesis that they could be the remnants of a symmetric supernova explosion of a high - velocity massive star which attained its peculiar velocity ( similar to that of the pulsar ) in the course of a strong dynamical three- or four - body encounter in the core of dense young star cluster . to check this hypothesis we investigated three dynamical processes involving close encounters between : ( i ) two hard massive binaries , ( ii ) a hard binary and an intermediate - mass black hole , and ( iii ) a single star and a hard binary intermediate - mass black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we find that main - sequence o - type stars can not be ejected from young massive star clusters with peculiar velocities high enough to explain the origin of hyperfast neutron stars , but lower mass main - sequence stars or the stripped helium cores of massive stars could be accelerated to hypervelocities . </S>",
    "<S> our explanation for the origin of hyperfast pulsars requires a very dense stellar environment of the order of @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although such high densities may exist during the core collapse of young massive star clusters , we caution that they have never been observed .    </S>",
