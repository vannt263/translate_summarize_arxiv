    "if @xmath1 is an @xmath9-symmetric convex body , then @xmath14 is the norm induced by @xmath1 , and @xmath15 is the norm of @xmath6 .",
    "if it is obvious which norm we mean , we may write simply @xmath16 .    let @xmath0 be a convex body in @xmath7 with @xmath17 .",
    "a closed nondegenerate segment @xmath11 $ ] , contained in a supporting line of @xmath0 ( also called a _ tangent line _ of @xmath0 ) and with @xmath18 , is a _ tangent segment of @xmath0 from @xmath6_. if for some norm @xmath14 and convex body @xmath19 , for any point @xmath2 and in any @xmath3-dimensional plane @xmath4 intersecting @xmath5 and containing @xmath6 , there are two tangent segments from @xmath6 to @xmath0 of the same length in @xmath14 , we say that @xmath0 satisfies the _ equal tangent property _ with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "it is well - known that euclidean balls have this property with respect to the standard euclidean norm , and it has been proved that , among convex bodies , only they have this property ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , wu @xcite showed that for any norm @xmath14 , if the unit ball @xmath1 has the equal tangent property with respect to @xmath14 , then @xmath1 is an ellipsoid .",
    "our first theorem is a combination of these results .",
    "we note that our definitions of tangent segment and equal tangent property are slightly more general than the one in @xcite . on the other hand , for a strictly convex body @xmath0 , equal tangent property with respect to @xmath14",
    "simplifies to the property that for any @xmath2 , all tangents from @xmath6 to @xmath0 have equal length with respect to @xmath14 .",

    "our second theorem involves angular bisectors in normed planes .",
    "based on the properties of angular bisectors in the euclidean plane , these bisectors can be defined in several ways . here",
    "we mention two of them ( cf . @xcite and @xcite , and for a detailed discussion on bisectors , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath20 be closed rays , and let @xmath14 be a norm .",
    "the _ busemann angular bisector _ of @xmath21 and @xmath22 with respect to @xmath14 is @xmath23    for the following definition we note that the distance of a point @xmath24 and a set @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath20 be closed rays , and let @xmath14 be a norm .",
    "the _ glogovskij angular bisector _ @xmath27 of @xmath21 and @xmath22 with respect to @xmath14 is the set of points in @xmath28 that are equidistant from @xmath21 and @xmath22 in @xmath14 .",
    "we remark that a point @xmath6 of the convex hull of the two rays is equidistant from the rays if , and only if , @xmath29 touches the rays for some @xmath30 , and thus , for any two rays , their glogovskij bisector is a closed ray .    in this note",
    "we define another angular bisector with respect to a strictly convex , smooth norm . to do this",
    ", we recall the notion of billiard reflection in a normed plane .",
    "a billiard path in a riemannian , or in particular in a euclidean space , is a piecewise smooth geodesic curve with the nonsmooth points contained in the boundary of the space , where the smooth arcs are connected via the reflection law : the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence .",
    "a generalization of billiard paths for finsler geometries was introduced by gutkin and tabachnikov @xcite , who replaced the reflection law by the _ least action principle _ , namely , that two points are connected by the shortest piecewise smooth geodesic arc containing a point of the boundary .",
    "formally , let @xmath14 be a strictly convex , smooth norm in @xmath31 , @xmath32 be a line , and let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be closed rays , with @xmath35 , that are not separated by @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath36 is a critical point of the distance function @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , then we say that @xmath34 is a _ billiard reflection _ of @xmath33 on @xmath32 with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "note that since @xmath14 is strictly convex and smooth , the distance function has a unique critical point , which is independent of the choice of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , for any two closed rays emanating from the same point , there is a unique line on which they are a billiard reflection , which coincides with the tangent line of any metric ellipse with its foci on the two rays . for reference on metric ellipses and conic sections in normed planes ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "billiard reflections can be interpreted geometrically as well ( cf . corollary 3.2 and proposition 5.1 of @xcite ) : if @xmath32 is a line containing @xmath9 , then @xmath41 is a billiard reflection of @xmath42 if , and only if , the tangent lines of @xmath1 at @xmath43 and @xmath44 meet on @xmath32 ( cf . figure  [ fig : reflection ] ) .",
    "we remark that billiard reflections in @xcite were defined only for norms with unit disks satisfying the @xmath45 differentiability property , and thus , the authors of @xcite gave a geometric interpretation only for such norms . on the other hand , recall",
    "that the subfamily of strictly convex @xmath45 norms is everywhere dense in the family of strictly convex , smooth norms ( cf .",
    "hence , by continuity , the equivalence of our definition with the geometric interpretation in figure  [ fig : reflection ] holds for any strictly convex , smooth norm .",
    "let @xmath46 and let @xmath14 be a strictly convex , smooth norm .",
    "we say that @xmath32 is an _ external billiard bisector _ of @xmath33 and @xmath34 with respect to @xmath14 , if @xmath34 is a billiard reflection of @xmath33 on @xmath32 with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "the closed ray of the external billiard bisector of @xmath33 and @xmath47 , contained in @xmath48 is called the _ internal billiard bisector _ or shortly _ billiard bisector _ of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , denoted by @xmath49 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : reflection ] , the two dashed lines show the external and the internal billiard bisectors of the rays @xmath42 and @xmath41 .    our second result is the following .",
    "[ thm : billiard ] let @xmath14 be a strictly convex , smooth norm .",
    "then the following are equivalent .",
    "* for every @xmath46 , we have @xmath50 . * for every @xmath46 , we have @xmath51 .",
    "* @xmath1 is an ellipse .",
    "we note that , by a result of dvelmeyer @xcite , busemann and glogovskij angular bisectors coincide if , and only if , the plane is a radon plane .",
    "the definition of billiards for normed planes gives rise to numerous possible questions , among which we mention one .",
    "it is well - known that in the euclidean plane the _ pedal triangle _ of an acute triangle @xmath52 ( that is the triangle connecting the base points of the altitudes of @xmath52 ) is a billiard triangle ; in fact , this is the only billiard triangle in @xmath52 .",
    "this billiard triangle is called the _",
    "fagnano orbit_. using the definition of billiard reflections , fagnano orbits can be generalized for normed planes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", we may define the altitudes of @xmath52 in a natural way : for a triangle @xmath52 with vertices @xmath53 and @xmath40 , @xmath54 $ ] is called an _ altitude _ of @xmath52 , if , in terms of birkhoff orthogonality , @xmath55 is _ normal _ to @xmath56 ( for birkhoff orthogonality , cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our question is the following .",
    "let @xmath14 be a strictly convex , smooth norm .",
    "prove or disprove that if the pedal triangle of any triangle @xmath52 , if it exists , is a billiard triangle in @xmath52 , then @xmath1 is an ellipse .",
    "in sections  [ sec : equaltangent ] and [ sec : billiard ] we present the proofs of theorems  [ thm : equaltangent ] and [ thm : billiard ] , respectively .",
    "in the proof we use the following definition and lemma . first , set @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 denote the family of curves , with endpoints @xmath59 and @xmath60 , that are contained in the triangle @xmath61 and can be obtained as an arc of the boundary of a strictly convex , smooth disk with supporting half planes @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "[ lem : ellipse ] if @xmath64 is an integral curve of the differential equation @xmath65 for @xmath66 , then @xmath67 is a conic section arc satisfying @xmath68 for some @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "note that as @xmath67 is an arc of the boundary of a smooth convex body , the function representing it is continuously differentiable for @xmath66 .",
    "we distinguish three cases .",
    "_ case 1 _ , @xmath71 in some subinterval of @xmath59 .",
    "multiplying both sides of ( [ eq : c2gen ] ) by @xmath72 , we may write the equation in the differential form @xmath73    note that the coefficients of ( [ eq : positive ] ) are continuously differentiable functions of @xmath74 in the ( simply connected ) subset of @xmath61 satisfying @xmath71 . furthermore , it satisfies schwarz s theorem , and thus , by poincar s lemma , it has a potential function @xmath75 .    using standard calculus , it is easy to check that any continuously differentiable potential function satisfies @xmath76 for some @xmath77 .",
    "thus , @xmath67 is a conic section arc .",
    "an elementary computation shows that the eigenvalues of its matrix are @xmath78 and @xmath79 with eigenvectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "thus , it defines an ellipse if @xmath82 , a parabola if @xmath83 , a hyperbola with a convex arc in @xmath66 if @xmath84 , the union of the lines @xmath85 and @xmath86 if @xmath87 , and a hyperbola with a concave arc in @xmath66 if @xmath88 .",
    "these last two possibilities are clearly impossible , thus we have @xmath89 .",
    "now , introducing the notation @xmath90 , we may rewrite ( [ eq : implicite ] ) as in ( [ eq : solution ] ) with @xmath91 .",
    "note that these integral curves have no common points with the circle @xmath92 , and thus , by the continuity of @xmath67 , we have that any curve @xmath67 satisfying the condition of case 1 is an arc of one of the curves in ( [ eq : solution ] ) with some @xmath91 .    _ case 2 _ , @xmath93 in some subinterval of @xmath59 . after multiplying both sides by @xmath94 , we may apply an argument similar to the one in case 1 to obtain the curves in ( [ eq : solution ] ) with @xmath95 .    _ case 3 _ , otherwise . consider a subinterval of @xmath59 . by our condition ,",
    "in this interval @xmath67 contains a point of the unit circle @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the @xmath97-coordinates of the intersection points of @xmath67 and the circle is an everywhere dense set in @xmath59 , which , by the continuity of @xmath67 , yields that @xmath67 is an arc of @xmath98 .",
    "first , we show the assertion for @xmath99 . to show that @xmath0 is strictly convex , we may use the idea in @xcite . more specifically ,",
    "suppose for contradiction that @xmath0 is not strictly convex , and consider a segment",

    "then the point @xmath100 is an exterior point of @xmath0 for any @xmath101 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath102 is sufficiently close to @xmath103 , then there are no two equal tangent segments of @xmath0 from @xmath104 ; a contradiction .",
    "now we show that @xmath0 is smooth .",
    "suppose for contradiction that @xmath6 is a nonsmooth point of @xmath105 ; that is , there are two lines @xmath106 and @xmath107 tangent to @xmath0 at @xmath6 .",

    ", we assume that @xmath0 is strictly convex and smooth .",
    "consider a parallelogram @xmath125 circumscribed about @xmath1 with the property that the midpoints of its sides belong to @xmath1 ; such a parallelogram exists : for instance , a smallest area parallelogram circumscribed about @xmath1 has this property .",
    "note that for any affine transformation @xmath126 , @xmath0 has the equal tangent property with respect to @xmath1 if and only if @xmath127 has this property with respect to @xmath128 .",
    "hence , we may assume that @xmath125 is the square with vertices @xmath80,@xmath81 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "consider the axis - parallel rectangle @xmath131 circumscribed about @xmath0 .",
    "note that by the equal tangent property , the two tangent segments from any vertex of @xmath131 are of equal euclidean length .",
    "thus , @xmath131 is a square , and the tangent points on its sides are symmetric to its two diagonals .",
    "since any homothetic copy of @xmath0 satisfies the equal tangent property , we may assume that the points @xmath60 and @xmath59 are common points of @xmath105 and @xmath132 and that the half planes @xmath62 and @xmath63 support @xmath0 .",
    "consider a point @xmath133 of @xmath105 with @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and let @xmath136 denote the slope of the tangent line @xmath137 of @xmath0 at @xmath138 .",
    "the equation of @xmath137 is : @xmath139 this line intersects the line @xmath86 at the point @xmath140 and the line @xmath141 at @xmath142 .",
    "let @xmath143 be the point with @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( cf .",

    ", we have that the arc of @xmath105 between @xmath60 and @xmath59 is of the form @xmath155 for some @xmath70 , and thus , in particular , it is symmetric about the line @xmath156 .    consider the point @xmath157 of this arc , and let @xmath158 be the point where the tangent line of @xmath0 at @xmath159 intersects the line @xmath86 .",
    "then , by the axial symmetry of the arc , we have that the tangent line of @xmath0 at @xmath160 intersects the line @xmath85 at @xmath161 .",
    "note that by the equal tangent property , the @xmath1-lengths of the segments @xmath162 $ ] and @xmath163 $ ] are both equal to @xmath164 .",
    "since they are of equal euclidean lengths as well , it follows that the radii of @xmath1 in their directions are of equal euclidean lengths , which yields that the union of the arcs of @xmath165 in the second and the fourth quadrants is symmetric about the line @xmath156 .",
    "thus , the two supporting lines of @xmath1 , parallel to the line @xmath156 , touch @xmath1 at points on the line @xmath166 .",
    "we may obtain similarly that the supporting lines of @xmath1 , parallel to the line @xmath166 , touch @xmath1 at points on the line @xmath156 .",
    "then the rectangle @xmath167 , with these four supporting lines as its sidelines , satisfies the property that the midpoints of its sides belong to @xmath1 .",
    "hence , we may repeat our argument with @xmath167 in place of @xmath125 , and obtain that @xmath105 is the union of another four conic section arcs .",
    "recall that conic section arcs are analytic , and thus , we have that the four arcs belong to the same conic section , which yields , by the compactness of @xmath0 , that @xmath0 is an ellipse .    now , consider an affine transformation @xmath126 that transforms @xmath0 into a euclidean disk .",
    "we may assume that the centre of both @xmath127 and @xmath128 is the origin .",

    "thus , @xmath128 is axially symmetric to any line passing through @xmath9 , and hence it is a euclidean disk .",
    "this yields the assertion for the plane .",
    "finally , we examine the case @xmath171 .",
    "consider any section of @xmath0 with a plane @xmath4 , and the intersection of @xmath1 with the plane @xmath172 parallel to @xmath4 that contains the origin .",
    "we may apply our previous argument , and obtain that these planar sections are homothetic ellipses .",
    "thus , a well - known theorem of burton @xcite yields that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are ellipsoids , from which the assertion readily follows .",
    "clearly , if @xmath1 is an ellipse , then all the three angular bisectors coincide .",
    "since @xmath1 is centrally symmetric , there is a parallelogram @xmath125 such that the midpoints of its sides belong to @xmath1 .",
    "we may apply an affine transformation such as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : equaltangent ] , and hence , we may assume that @xmath125 is the square with vertices @xmath80 , @xmath130 , @xmath129 and @xmath81 .",

    "<S> the first one is that if @xmath0 is a convex body in a normed space with unit ball @xmath1 , and for any point @xmath2 and in any @xmath3-dimensional plane @xmath4 intersecting @xmath5 and containing @xmath6 , there are two tangent segments of the same normed length from @xmath6 to @xmath0 , then @xmath0 and @xmath1 are homothetic ellipsoids . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that if @xmath1 is the unit ball of a strictly convex , smooth norm , and in this norm billiard angular bisectors coincide with busemann angular bisectors or glogovskij angular bisectors , then @xmath1 is an ellipse . </S>"
