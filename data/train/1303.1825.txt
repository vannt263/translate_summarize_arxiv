    "there is a general consensus that the outer atmosphere of the sun ( and other cool stars ) is heated by one or several mechanisms related to the magnetic field ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "despite the pivotal importance of the magnetic field for our understanding of the corona , actual measurements of the magnetic field are scarce  mostly we have to rely on extrapolations of the magnetic field from the photosphere ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "because the extrapolations are based on assumptions that might or might not be fulfilled in regions of interest in the corona , there is the need to actually measure the coronal magnetic field .",
    "some measurements in the corona have been performed in active region loops above the limb using the zeeman effect for infrared coronagraphic observations @xcite .",
    "these , as well as radio measurements ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suffer from low spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "a very promising project for diagnostics of the magnetic field in the upper chromosphere is the rocket experiment chromospheric lyman - alpha spectro - polarimeter ( clasp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , planned to be flown in dec2014 .",
    "this is based on diagnostics using the hanle effect wiin ly-@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to measure the magnetic field on the solar disk at high resolution in the transition region from the chromosphere to the corona was done using the _ solar maximum mission _ ( smm ) ultraviolet spectrometer and polarimeter ( uvsp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . reaching a polarimetric accuracy of just below 1% in the c line at 1548",
    "@xcite gave no conclusive results , except maybe in sunspots @xcite .",
    "as it will become clear in this manuscript , an accuracy of 0.1% would be needed to get useful information on the magnetic field with the c line .",
    "this accuracy is provided by the solar ultraviolet magnetograph investigation ( sumi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that has been flown on a rocket twice .",
    "the c data from the latest flight in summer 2012 await calibration and analysis .",
    "the present study will present a forward model which provides synthesized polarimetric data as they are recorded , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  by sumi",
    ". this will allow a direct comparison between model and observations and will ( hopefully ) provide some guidance for the interpretation of the acquired polarimetric observations .",
    "a 3d model is prerequisite to investigate the transition region , because of its highly complex spatial structuring ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , this study is based on a 3d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) numerical experiment that provides temperature , density , velocity and of course the magnetic field in the corona above a small active region .",
    "this model produces a loop - dominated corona @xcite . in a statistical sense",
    "it reproduces various observational properties @xcite , in particular the persistent transition region redshifts @xcite .",
    "based on the success of these models the present study goes one step further to investigate not only the profiles of the emission lines , but also the circular polarization due to the zeeman effect .",
    "another forward modeling investigation of the polarization of the emergent radiation in an mhd model of the extended solar atmosphere , but for the ( optically thick ) hydrogen ly-@xmath2 line , has been carried out by @xcite paying particular attention to the linear polarization produced by scattering processes and the hanle effect .",
    "once the instruments provide the required polarimetric sensitivity , we will have to perform a proper interpretation of the data .",
    "the extreme uv lines formed in the transition region ( or in hotter parts of the atmosphere ) originate from a spatially complex volume , comparable to highly corrugated surfaces .",
    "this is a fundamental difference to photospheric magnetic field observations , where the height of the source surface remains at a roughly constant altitude , within one barometric scale height .",
    "this more complex source region of transition region lines complicates possible inversions enormously .",
    "furthermore , the high temporal variability of the intensity will be a major problem for the interpretation of the polarimetric data .",
    "the forward - model approach presented in this study provides insight into these problems by accounting for all the spatial and temporal complexity .    in section[s :",
    "synthetic.spectra ] the basic concept of the 3d mhd model and the spectral synthesis including the calculation of the stokes @xmath1 profile will be introduced .",
    "based on this in section[s : diagnostics ] we will present how to synthesize the observable quantities and present some sample stokes @xmath1 profiles in section[s : profiles ] .",
    "the observational requirements for the exposure times will be discussed in section[s : variability ] along with the spatio - temporal variability found in observations and in synthesized model data . in section[s : real.obs ] we will construct a realistic stokes @xmath1 observation of c and show that we can afford comparably long exposure times for the observations  and why . finally , in section[s :",
    "inversion ] we will discuss some simple inversions and their reliability , before we conclude the paper with section[s : conclusions ] .",
    "in general , the state of polarization of the light can be described by the stokes vector @xmath3 .",
    "stokes @xmath0 represents the integral over all polarization states , while stokes @xmath1 is the difference of right- and left - circularly polarized light , and hence carries information on the longitudinal component of the magnetic field through the zeeman effect . for an observation near disk center and assuming that the magnetic field will be predominantly vertical , we can expect stokes @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which characterize the linear polarization , to be much weaker than stokes @xmath1 , just as found in photospheric observations in the visible . because it will turn out that already the stokes @xmath1 signal will be at the edge of observability",
    ", this study will concentrate on stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 only .      in order to calculate the stokes profiles",
    ", one needs the temperature @xmath6 , density @xmath7 , velocity vector @xmath8 , and magnetic field vector @xmath9 .",
    "these are provided by a 3d mhd model that solves for the induction equation , the conservation of mass , and the momentum and energy balance .",
    "most importantly , the energy balance has to include heat conduction and radiative losses .",
    "this is pivotal to set the proper coronal pressure and therefore a prerequisite to synthesize coronal emission lines which are very sensitive to the temperature and density .",
    "the mhd model used for this study has been published already by @xcite , and an analysis of this model in terms of doppler shifts and emission measure and a comparison to observations was presented by @xcite . in the model",
    "the plasma is heated through ohmic dissipation of currents that are induced by the braiding of magnetic field lines through the horizontal photospheric granular motions .",
    "the good match to the observations showed that this model provides a realistic way to describe the corona in an active region , accounting for the spatial and temporal variability .",
    "since then further models of similar type solidified these results discussing details of the heat input @xcite , providing further insight into the persistent transition region doppler shifts @xcite , transient events in the corona @xcite , or the constant cross section of loops @xcite .",
    "all these results give good confidence that this type of model will also allow for a reliable and realistic determination of the stokes @xmath1 profiles in a transition region extreme uv line .      to calculate the stokes profile @xmath10 we follow exactly the procedure of @xcite .",
    "under the assumption of ionization equilibrium we calculate the emissivity ( energy loss per time and volume ) at each grid point in the computational domain in the c ( 1548 ) line using the atomic data base @xcite . in order to avoid aliasing effects",
    "we interpolate the mesh in the vertical direction .",
    "the line width is assumed to be the thermal width , @xmath11 , and the doppler shift is given by the line - of - sight component of the velocity vector ( here the vertical component ) .",
    "this provides a line profile @xmath10 at each grid point .      in a magnetic field",
    "a spectral line will be affected by the zeeman effect .",
    "the zeeman splitting is given through @xmath12 with the elementary charge @xmath13 , the speed of light @xmath14 , the electron mass @xmath15 , the rest wavelength @xmath16 , the effective land factor @xmath17 and the component of the magnetic field along the lone of sight @xmath18 .",
    "in the weak - field limit the stokes @xmath1 signal is given through through a fourier expansion up to first order of the stokes @xmath0 line profile ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",

    "this combination provides the best potential among the transition region lines .",
    "the effective land factor for the 1548  line ( @xmath20 ) is @xmath21 ( for details on the calculation of @xmath17 see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* sects.6.4 & 6.5 ) .",
    "while the 1550  line of the c doublet has a slightly higher effective land factor ( @xmath22 ) , its radiance is lower by a factor of about two , which is why we concentrate on the 1548  line .    even for a very strong magnetic field in the transition region of 1000 g",
    "the splitting for the c lines would be below @xmath23pm corresponding to less than 0.3kms@xmath24 in doppler shift units .",
    "this can be considered as an upper limit .",
    "consequently , in the case of c the zeeman splitting is much smaller than the doppler broadening of the line , @xmath25 , the latter being about 6 pm corresponding to 12kms@xmath24 at the line formation temperature of c of about @xmath26k .",
    "thus the application of the weak - field limit for equation([e : stokes ] ) is justified .    from equation([e : stokes ] ) we can roughly estimate the stokes @xmath27 signal to be expected in c. for this we assume a magnetic field of 100 g ( above a pore or a strong network patch ) in the transition region some 3 mm above the photosphere .",
    "then , for a line width of the order of the thermal width the expected signal is about @xmath28 , which would be measurable with planned instrumentation ( cf .",
    "section[s : conclusions ] ) .    with the line - of - sight magnetic field from the 3d model and the stokes @xmath0 profile from section[s :",
    "intensity ] we can compute the stokes @xmath1 profile according to equation([e : stokes ] ) at each grid point on the interpolated mesh of the computational domain .    in this study",
    "we will concentrate on the c line formed at about @xmath26k .",
    "it could be easily also done for any other extreme uv emission line , _",
    "e.g. _ , the o line at 1032  formed at some 300000k , or the mg line at 625  formed at @xmath29k to study the coronal magnetic field .",
    "however , at the shorter wavelengths the stokes @xmath1 signal will be weaker .",
    "furthermore , at higher temperature , on average found at higher heights , the magnetic field will be weaker .",
    "thus to detect a stokes @xmath1 signal from these lines the sensitivity of future instruments would have to be well below 0.1% .",
    "signal normalized by the line intensity ( see eq.[e : stokes.map ] ) .",
    "the field of view shown here is about 27@xmath3027mm@xmath31 and represents part of the whole computational domain .",
    "the two yellow crosses denote the locations for which the sample stokes @xmath1 spectra are plotted in figure[f : stokes_sample]a .",
    "the red and green boxes show the regions over which realistic stokes profiles are synthesized ( figure[f : stokes.profiles ] ) and in which the temporal variation is analyzed ( figure[f : stokes.vari ] ) .",
    "the long blue bar indicates the line along which the spatial variation is analyzed ( figure[f : stokes.spatial ] ) . ]",
    "for this study we will restrict the discussion to a part of the computational domain covering about 27@xmath3027mm@xmath31 in the horizontal directions .",
    "this region of interest contains a magnetic structure at the bottom boundary that resembles a pore on the real sun .",
    "the ( vertical component of ) the magnetic field at the bottom boundary , _",
    "i.e. _ the photosphere , in this area is shown in figure[f : stokes.maps](a ) . in this region",
    "the photospheric magnetic field is predominantly of one sign",
    ".    we will investigate synthetic extreme uv observations for which the line of sight is aligned with the vertical .",
    "for this we integrate the stokes @xmath10 and @xmath32 profiles along the vertical direction , @xmath33 this will produce observables as they would be found in actual observations of the sun close to disk center when employing an extreme uv spectro - polarimeter .",
    "these data can then be analyzed in the same way as actual observations of the sun would be handled .",
    "for instance , one can derive maps of the total line intensity , doppler shifts , or the wavelength - integrated stokes @xmath1 signal .",
    "in particular , we define the total intensity and the integrated stokes @xmath1 signal as @xmath34 the latter gives the fraction of the ( unsigned ) stokes signal along the line of sight when compared to the total line emission . in figures[f : stokes.maps]b and [ f : stokes.maps]d we show the resulting maps of @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the part of the computational domain under investigation here .    having access to the three - dimensional distribution of the c emission in the computational domain , at each horizontal location @xmath37 we can derive at which height @xmath38 the main contribution of c is originating from .",
    "this defines the line - formation height , which is visualized in figure[f : stokes.height]a .",
    "as noted before , this is a highly corrugated surface .",
    "typically , the line - formation height is the lowest where the intensity is the highest  where the heating is particularly high the transition will move to lower heights and produce more emission . even when considering only regions with considerable field strength , where the stokes signal @xmath36 as defined in equation([e : stokes.map ] ) exceeds @xmath39 , there is a wide range of heights of the source region of c. the histogram in figure[f : stokes.height]b shows that there the formation of c is mostly found between 3 mm and 4 mm , sometimes reaching up to 6 mm .",
    "this corresponds to several chromospheric pressure scales height ( @xmath40300 km ) .",
    "having the line - formation - height , we can now extract the magnetic field at the source region of c. we plot the vertical component of this , _",
    "i.e. _ , the line - of - sight component , in figure[f : stokes.maps]c .",
    "this map of the transition region magnetic field is _ not _ just a horizontal cut , but shows the magnetic field at the actual height of the main transition region emission for each horizontal location , _",
    "i.e. _ , on the corrugated surface shown in figure[f : stokes.height]a .",
    "this surface of the maximum contribution of c coincides with the location where the temperature jump into the corona is found .",
    "however , the spatial structure of the transition region is even more complicated than this .",
    "the emission of the optically thin c line is not restricted to this surface , but pockets of @xmath26k cool plasma are also found higher up in the ( generally ) hotter volume of the corona , as can be seen from the images and movies of @xcite .",
    "one should keep this in mind when interpreting the data  along the line - of - sight various structure can contribute to the emission seen in transition region lines .    comparing the photospheric and transition region magnetic field in figures[f : stokes.maps]a and [ f : stokes.maps]c , it is clear that the transition region field is much smoother and no longer shows any signs of ( small - scale ) mixed polarities .",
    "the opposite polarities in the photosphere are a couple of mm apart , so at a height of 3 mm and higher , where c is formed , all these mixed polarities are closed already .",
    "similar to a simple potential field expansion , the 3d mhd model shows the expansion and smoothing of the magnetic field with height .",
    "profiles and histogram of the distribution of stokes @xmath1 signals . panel ( a ) shows two sample stokes @xmath1 profiles normalized to the peak line intensity for the locations marked by crosses in figure[f : stokes.maps ] ( the stronger signal shown as a solid line corresponds to the right cross ) .",
    "panel ( b ) displays the distribution of stokes @xmath1 signals as defined in equation([e : stokes.map ] ) for the field of view shown in figure[f : stokes.maps ] .",
    "about one third of the area shows a stokes @xmath1 signal above 0.1% . alternatively one could also plot the histogram of the peak values of the stokes @xmath1 profiles , which would show a very similar result .",
    "see section[s : profiles ] . ]",
    "two examples of stokes @xmath1 profiles are shown in figure[f : stokes_sample]a .",
    "the sample from the location close to the center of the magnetic field concentration in the photosphere shows a peak - to - peak signal in stokes @xmath1 of c normalized to the peak intensity of almost 1% .",
    "this profile is among the strongest stokes @xmath1 signals in the field - of - view ( right cross in figure[f : stokes.maps ] ) .",
    "the signal is symmetric and close to a stokes @xmath1 signal in an idealized situation . in regions where the magnetic field is weak , but where still significant emission in c is present ( left cross in figure[f : stokes.maps ] ) , the stokes @xmath1 signal typically is weaker than 0.1% .    the distribution of the c stokes @xmath1 signals in the field - of - view displayed in figure[f : stokes_sample]b reveals that about one third of the area shows a signal above 0.1% .",
    "this is within the detection limit of the sumi rocket @xcite .",
    "likewise , the future rocket mission clasp @xcite will achieve this accuracy in the extreme uv ( albeit at ly-@xmath2 ) .",
    "furthermore the space - based observatory solmex that was proposed to esa @xcite would have included a spectro - polarimeter with the required capabilities for c observations ( see also section[s : conclusions ] ) .",
    "the majority of the area in the field - of - view visible in figure[f : stokes.maps ] shows signals much smaller than 0.1% ( cf .",
    "figure[f : stokes_sample]b ) that will not be detectable .",
    "mostly these weak signals originate from regions with very low emission in c. so besides the weak stokes @xmath1 signal also the low intensity would prevent the detection of a signal here because of the limitation in signal - to - noise .    the distribution in figure[f : stokes_sample]b shows the stokes signal as defined in equation([e : stokes.map ] ) , _ i.e. _ , the total unsigned stokes @xmath1 normalized by the total intensity .",
    "the distribution for the peak values of stokes @xmath1 normalized by the peak intensity would show a very similar distribution .",
    "based on the discussion of figures[f : stokes.maps]d and [ f : stokes_sample]b in section[s : profiles ] , and considering the order - of - magnitude arguments in section[s : stokes ] it is clear that instruments would have to detect a stokes @xmath1 signal ( normalized to @xmath0 ) of 0.001 or better .",
    "this implies that the signal - to - noise ratio of the recorded data has to better than 1000 .",
    "assuming poisson statistics this leads to the conclusion that the detector has to acquire at least @xmath29 counts ( or @xmath41 counts for a @xmath42 detection ) .",
    "this will set a limit of the required exposure time .    as a simple experiment one can investigate a time series of actual observations to get an estimate of the exposure time .",
    "the most recent instrument that recorded high - quality solar data in c is sumer @xcite . because of the lack of a well suited time series in c here data from si",
    "are used , a line that forms at similar temperatures as c. the two lines share the major observational properties , _",
    "e.g. _ , variability , line shifts , contrast , etc .",
    "12 minutes 10@xmath43 counts were reached and the noise level dropped to 10@xmath44 .",
    "see section[s : required.exp].,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    to investigate the noise level , a time series with high temporal cadence is analyzed and the acquired counts are accumulated .",
    "this is possible with a photon counting device as sumer .",
    "assuming poisson statistics , which is a good approximation for the sumer detector , the noise - to - signal ratio is derived .",
    "this is simply the inverse of the square root of the accumulated counts . in figure[f : intensity.noise ] this noise - to - signal ratio based on the accumulated counts is shown as a function of the observational time .",
    "as expected the noise level generally drops in time .",
    "the details depend on the time - variable emission , of course . for the particular example shown in figure[f : intensity.noise ] after some 12 minutes a noise level of 0.001 is reached .    therefore , to reach a signal - to - noise level to detect a stokes @xmath1 signal of 0.001",
    "one would have to integrate for some 12 minutes , too .",
    "the data shown here are for a bright patch in the network , so for regions with higher magnetic field , _ e.g. _ , in the vicinity of a pore , we can expect higher emission in the transition region lines , and thus a shorter exposure time would be sufficient .",
    "also a more modern instrument could have a higher throughput and larger aperture , which would in part be counterweight by the additional optics needed to analyze the state of polarization of the incoming light .",
    "so as a very rough estimate one might need exposure times of the order of minutes .    in the light of the high variability of the transition region emission",
    "this poses the question if stokes @xmath1 observations with such comparably long exposure times are meaningful . after presenting the transition region variability in actual observations ( section[s : sumer.obs ] ) and in the synthesized model data ( section[s : synt.vari ] )",
    "the discussion will turn to this question in section[s : real.obs ] .",
    "1 spatial pixel ( crosses ) .",
    "the bars in the panels indicate the average uncertainty for the line intensity ( poisson noise ) .",
    "the crosses indicate the spatial pixels ( left ) and times of exposures ( right ) .",
    "the temporal and the spatial variability is down to the resolution limit of sumer . see section[s : sumer.obs ] . ]    just as an example , figure[f : obs.variability ] shows the temporal and spatial variability of the transition region emission .",
    "the spectra were acquired in the quiet sun in a region with strong network activity .",
    "the spatial variation ( panel a ) shows a 35 mm ( @xmath4048 ) long cut through two network patches with enhanced emission . besides this spatial variation on a scale of some 10 mm ,",
    "also variations down to the resolution limit ( 1  spatial sampling ) can be seen .",
    "it has to be emphasized that this pixel - to - pixel variation is _ not _ noise , but represents real variability not fully resolved by the instrument .    for the temporal variation ( figure[f : obs.variability]b ) one can identify fluctuations also down to the sampling of the instrument ( here 10s )",
    "again , these fast fluctuations are real , and consistent with the very short cooling times in the transition region .",
    "stronger fluctuations well above a factor of two occur in time scales of minutes that are omnipresent on the sun . in this example",
    "two cases , one shorter and one longer can be identified .",
    "these brightenings can be classified as blinkers that have been studied abundantly @xcite    this strong variability in time ( and space ) raises the question to what extent spectro - polarimetric data will be useful to investigate the transition region magnetic field with instruments that will have limited spatial and temporal resolution",
    ". this can be explored by observations synthesized from a model , where the magnetic field is known .",
    "1.6mm@xmath31 squares labeled in figure[f : stokes.maps]a as ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the thick solid lines show the variation of the average intensity in the respective square , while the thin lines with the crosses show the variation at the central grid point in that square .",
    "the bottom panels ( a2 ) and ( b2 ) show the variation of the magnetic field at the line formation height of c , _",
    "i.e. _ , the source region of the transition region emission .",
    "again , this is done for the average within the respective square ( thick ) and the central grid point ( thin with crosses ) .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the magnetic field inverted from the average stokes @xmath1 signal as discussed in section[s : inversion ] .",
    "see section[s : synt.vari ] . ]",
    "examples for the temporal variability of the transition region emission synthesized from the 3d mhd model are shown in figure[f : stokes.vari ] ( top panels ) for the squares labeled ( a ) and ( b ) in figure[f : stokes.maps ] .",
    "these regions are selected to be in regions near the main polarity with medium ( a ) and high ( b ) intensity in c. in the figure the variation integrated over an area of 1.6@xmath451.6mm@xmath31 ( roughly 2@xmath452 ) is plotted along with the intensity of the simulation in the center of that square .",
    "as expected , the variation integrated over the square is smoother than the one in its center , with the variation being quite similar in both cases .    in both examples shown in figure[f : stokes.vari ] transient brightenings are visible that last a few minutes with an enhancement of the intensity by about a factor of about four .",
    "these brightenings are induced by short increases of the heating rate , which are ubiquitously present in these 3d mhd models ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the brightenings shown here have properties similar to the observed ones in figure[f : obs.variability ] , and could therefore be considered as a valuable model for blinkers @xcite .",
    "however , the relation of the observed blinkers to the brightenings in these 3d mhd models will be left for a future study .",
    "in contrast to the spectroscopic observations , in the model one can compare the intensity variation to the magnetic field @xmath46 in the source region of the transition region emission ( bottom row of figure[f : stokes.vari ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the magnetic field strength in the source region changes only slightly , while the intensity changes dramatically .",
    "the fact that the plasma-@xmath47 parameter is much smaller than unity in the source region of c ( cf .",
    "* their figure12 ) allows very strong and rapid intensity variation while the magnetic field remains mostly unaffected .",
    "this opens the possibility to infer the transition region magnetic field despite the high temporal variability of the emission ( cf .",
    "section[s : real.obs ] ) .    in example",
    "( a ) in the left column the magnetic field strength changes only by some 20% , while the intensity increases by a factor of three . with the increased heating the transition region moves downward to higher densities to be able to radiate the increased amount of heat input . because the scale height in the chromosphere is only some 300 km , moving down by about 150 km is sufficient to relocate the transition region to densities a factor of about 1.7 higher .",
    "the emission goes with the density squared and thus this change of height of the source region by 150 km will change the intensity ( and thus the radiative losses ) by a factor of three . over this small change in height",
    "the magnetic field is changing only slightly , hence the small decrease of @xmath48 by some 30 g at the time of the peak of emission in the example ( a ) .",
    "the example ( b ) in the right column of figure[f : stokes.vari ] also shows only a small change in magnetic field while the intensity changes significantly . here",
    "the magnetic field in the area is dropping towards the end of the time frame shown because of the ( comparably slow ) changes induced by the footpoint motions .",
    "this leads to weaker currents , less heating and consequently less transition region emission .    in figure[f :",
    "stokes.vari ] only @xmath49 and the magnetic field in the source region , @xmath46 are plotted .",
    "because according to equation([e : stokes ] ) stokes@xmath1 is basically proportional to @xmath0 and @xmath46 , and because @xmath46 is quite constant , stokes@xmath1 is changing in a manner very similar to @xmath0 .",
    "this is why @xmath50 is not plotted in figure[f : stokes.vari ] . normalizing @xmath50 by @xmath49 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath36 as defined in equation([e : stokes.map ] ) , basically gives the magnetic field , see also section[s : inversion ] and equation([e : magnetograph ] ) .",
    "therefore the variation of the ( normalized ) stokes @xmath1 signal , @xmath36 , closely follows the magnetic field in the source region , @xmath46 .",
    "thus we plotted only @xmath46 but not @xmath36 in figure[f : stokes.vari ] .     and",
    "is shown for the same time as the snapshot displayed there .",
    "see section[s : synt.vari ] . ]",
    "the spatial variation basically shows the same properties as the temporal variation : strong intensity variation with only small changes of the magnetic field in the source region . to illustrate this , figure[f : stokes.spatial ] shows the variation along the blue bar in figure[f : stokes.maps ] . despite the large - scale variation of the magnetic field across the region of the pore , in the region of strongest magnetic field ( @xmath51 from about 40 mm to 50 mm )",
    "there is only a small variation in magnetic field , while the c intensity changes by a factor of 4 to 5 . here",
    "the close relation between the decreased emission and magnetic field near @xmath52 mm to the increase in formation height can be seen .",
    "the small increase in formation height ( due to less heating ) by some 300 km leads to only a small change in magnetic field . because the ( chromospheric ) scale height is comparable to this change in formation height , the change in emission is quite dramatic .",
    "the above discussion shows that the observations and the synthesized emission from the 3d model show very strong variations in the emissivity .",
    "a future spectro - polarimetric instrument would have only a limited resolution in space _ and _ time because of the limitations in count rate and signal - to - noise to detect the weak stokes @xmath1 signal . to get a realistic estimate for a possible spectro - polarimetric observation of c ,",
    "the estimate for the exposure time from section[s : required.exp ] and figure[f : intensity.noise ] adapted for specifications similar to sumer are used . in particular , a resolution element of about 2  and an exposure time of 12 minutes will be adopted .",
    "this can be considered as a worst case , because more modern instruments ( will ) have a significantly higher efficiency . if a stokes @xmath1 signal is visible with such a long exposure , clearly it will be visible for the shorter exposure times of more modern instruments .",
    "the two panels show the synthesized stokes @xmath1 profiles in the 1.6@xmath301.6mm@xmath31 squares labeled in figure[f : stokes.maps ] accordingly .",
    "the synthetic observation was integrated in space over the square and in time for 12min .",
    "the bars show a potential observation at a spectral sampling comparable to that of the sumer instrument with a noise level of @xmath39 .",
    "see section[s : real.obs ] . ]",
    "figure [ f : stokes.profiles ] shows synthesized stokes @xmath1 profiles integrated in space over a square of 1.6@xmath451.6mm@xmath31 ( boxes in figure[f : stokes.maps ] ) and in time over the 12 minutes for which the temporal variation of the intensity is shown in these squares in figure[f : stokes.vari ] . to get a more realistic representation ,",
    "the stokes @xmath1 spectra are shown as bars with a spectral sampling comparable to the sumer instrument and with the addition of a noise level of 10@xmath44 .",
    "this shows that in the both regions selected here , close to the pore and in its vicinity , one can detect a stokes @xmath1 signal with an instrument having a detection limit in stokes @xmath1 over @xmath0 of about 10@xmath44 .",
    "the main result from this experiment is that a stokes @xmath1 signal survives even when integrating in space and time , despite the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the intensity on scales shorter than the length and time scales the spectrum is integrated during the exposure .",
    "this is basically because the magnetic field is comparatively constant ( in time and space ) , at least much smoother than the intensity ( see section[s : synt.vari ] ) . in conclusion",
    ", this model shows that the question posed in the heading of the current section can be answered with : yes , we can afford long exposure times to get information on the magnetic field .",
    "it might be that one can carry over this conclusion to existing measurements of the magnetic field in the upper atmosphere by spectro - polarimetry in the infrared .",
    "for example the signals of forbidden and optically - thin lines detected in active region coronal loops with a coronagraph ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might represent the background magnetic field .",
    "the polarization signals of the allowed he i 10830  triplet , which is not optically thin , observed in spicules above the limb @xcite may well represent the magnetic field of the spicular plasma itself , as argued by these authors .",
    "even if one can detect a stokes @xmath1 signal in c , it is not clear to what extent one can invert the longitudinal component of the magnetic field in the source region of the transition region emission . to test this , as a first step we derive a very simple magnetograph equation from equation([e : stokes ] ) and compare the resulting inverted magnetic field to the magnetic field in the 3d model . using the wavelength and the effective land factor for the c line , @xmath53  and @xmath54 , and assuming that the line width is comparable to the thermal width , @xmath55 , one can rewrite equation([e : stokes ] ) as @xmath56 ~\\approx~ 46\\,000~\\overline{v } ~.\\ ] ] because in the 3d model the magnetic field @xmath48 is known at each grid point , one can now compare the inverted magnetic field @xmath57 to the actual magnetic field in the source region to test this simplest inversion procedure .",
    "as a first step we investigate the two realistic sample spectra shown in figure[f : stokes.profiles ] . here the stokes @xmath1 signals for regions ( a ) and ( b ) are @xmath58% and @xmath59% .",
    "following equation([e : magnetograph ] ) this corresponds to inverted magnetic field strengths of @xmath60 g and 250 g .",
    "these inverted values are plotted as dashed lines in figure[f : stokes.vari ] on top of the variation of the magnetic field during the exposure of these spectra . in these two cases",
    "the simple inversion seems to work and represents some average value of the ( line - of - sight ) magnetic field in the source region of the transition region emission . comparing the actual and inverted magnetic field in the bottom panels of figure[f : stokes.vari ] we estimate the error of this procedure to be about 20% .     of c as defined in equation([e : stokes.map ] ) .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the ratio of the magnetic field strength @xmath57 reconstructed by the magnetograph equation equation([e : magnetograph ] ) to the magnetic field at the line formation height , _",
    "i.e. _ , on the currogated source surface of c. in contrast , panel ( b ) shows the ratio of @xmath57 to the magnetic field at a fixed height ( @xmath61 mm ) , where the horizontally averaged temperature is @xmath26k .",
    "see section[s : inversion ] . ]    to test if the simple inversion also works in a statistical sense , we look at the scatter of the ratio of the inverted field @xmath57 to the actual ( line - of - sight ) magnetic field @xmath48 in the c source region .",
    "this is shown in figure[f : inversion]a as a function of the stokes @xmath1 signal .",
    "at least in those areas where the stokes @xmath1 signal is above a noise level of @xmath39 , there is a close correlation between the inverted and the actual magnetic field : the inverted signal is within about 5% of the value from the 3d model .",
    "however , it has to be remembered , that this is without any noise , which will ( in part ) degrade the nice correlation .    from figure[f :",
    "stokes.height]a it is clear that the c source region is far from being close to a flat plane .",
    "of course , this raises the question on the usability of the inverted values of the magnetic field , which mainly reflects the field on the highly corrugated source surface of the transition region emission in c as seen in figure[f : inversion]a .",
    "therefore in figure[f : inversion]b we compare the inverted magnetic field @xmath57 to the magnetic field at a constant height in the computational box . here",
    "we choose a height of @xmath62 mm , which in this model represents the height where the _ horizontally averaged _ temperature reaches @xmath26k .",
    "this shows a much stronger scatter .",
    "still , if one assumes that the measurement would represent the magnetic field at a constant height , one would be able to invert the magnetic field within some 20% to 30% ( most values in figure[f : inversion]b above a stokes @xmath1 signal of 0.1% have a ratio from 0.75 to 1.05 ) .",
    "of course , this is again without assuming noise of the measurement .",
    "certainly , the community will have to develop more elaborate inversion procedures to interpret the stokes @xmath1 measurements in c in the future .",
    "however , even with the simple magnetograph - type inversion presented here one can hope to measure the transition region magnetic field within some 30% .",
    "this paper presents a forward modeling of the stokes profiles in the extreme uv to investigate the diagnostic potential of emission lines for investigations of the magnetic field in the transition region and low corona .",
    "this study shows that with instruments providing a polarimetric sensitivity of stokes @xmath27 of about 0.1% this task to measure the transition region magnetic field can be reached ; probably within some 20% to 30% using simple magnetograph - type inversions as a first step .",
    "this study for c employs a realistic 3d mhd model that self - consistently solves for the magnetic structure _ and _ the transition region and coronal plasma properties . the emission synthesized from the model",
    "is highly structured in space and shows a strong temporal variability , just as actual observations .",
    "naively one would expect that this high level of variation would destroy any significant polarization signal from the magnetic field .",
    "however , because the magnetic field structure is rather stable and smooth , the stokes @xmath1 signal survives even when integrating in space and time .",
    "therefore spectro - polarimeters operating in the extreme uv will be able to provide reliable diagnostics of the transition region magnetic field . during its first flight in summer 2010 the sumi rocket acquired some minutes worth of polarization data in mg @xcite .",
    "a second flight took place in summer 2012 .",
    "the c data of this latter flight are currently calibrated and analysed , and it will be of high interest to see how they compare to the synthesized model data shown in this study  in particular if the field - of - view of sumi would include some regions comparable to the magnetic structures shown here .    of course , it would be desirable to have measurements of the magnetic field in the transition region as proposed here on a space - based observatory , and embedded into a suite of instruments that will provide information on the magnetic field also in the chromosphere and the corona . the solmex space mission @xcite would have provided such comprehensive measurements of the coronal magnetic field in the solar upper atmosphere , and was proposed to esa recently . continuing the theoretical and instrumental efforts , an opportunity might open up to confront the synthetic stokes @xmath1 data from the transition region presented here to actual observations .",
    "the author greatly acknowledges the collaboration with b.gudiksen and .nordlund that stood at the beginning of this project to derive synthetic observations from coronal models .",
    "in particular , the author is grateful to b.gudiksen for sharing data used in this study .",
    "sincere thanks are due to j. trujillo bueno for his comments on the manuscript ."
