    "amorphous semiconductor materials like chalcogenide glasses present a great potential for application in technological devices , such as optical fibers , memory materials and switching devices , but their use is limited due to several factors .",
    "one of them is the difficulty in obtaining information about atomic structures , which define the short - range order ( sro ) of the alloy . in this context , the structures of amorphous ge@xmath9se@xmath10 ( _ a_-ge@xmath9se@xmath10 ) and liquid ge@xmath9se@xmath10 ( _ l_-ge@xmath9se@xmath10 ) , in particular ge@xmath11se@xmath12 ( gese@xmath13 ) , have been extensively studied by several experimental techniques , like neutron diffraction ( nd ) @xcite , x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) @xcite , extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) @xcite and raman spectroscopy ( rs ) @xcite . on the theoretical side , molecular dynamics simulations ( md )",
    "@xcite have been carried out to understand the sro in these liquids and glasses in terms of two possible and distinct models . in the first one the distribution of bonds in the structure is purely randomic and determined by the local coordination numbers and composition . in the second one",
    ", there is a strong sro and the structure is formed by well defined structural units , e.g. , corner - sharing gese@xmath14 ( cs ) tetrahedral and edge - sharing ge@xmath13se@xmath15 ( es ) bitetrahedral units .",
    "the distribution of these units gives raise to a medium , or intermediate , range order ( iro ) , whose signature is the appearance of a first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) in the neutron @xcite or x - ray structure factors @xcite at many compositions . in particular , nd experiments performed on melt - quenched @xcite ( mq ) gese@xmath13 ( mq - gese@xmath13 ) showed a fsdp in the total structure factor @xmath16 which was associated with correlations in the range of 56   .",
    "as described in ref .  , this alloy is formed by cs and es units with heteropolar bonds but there are homopolar bonds in very small quantities .",
    "these results are reproduced by md simulations in _",
    "l_-gese@xmath13 @xcite and _",
    "@xcite , except the fsdp in the bathia - thorton ( bt ) @xcite concentration - concentration structure factor @xmath17 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that almost all available data about _ a_-ge@xmath9se@xmath10 alloys were determined for mq samples , and the preparation method can affect the sro and iro , as it was reported by takeuchi",
    "_ et al_. @xcite by comparing the structures of _ a_-ge@xmath0se@xmath1 produced by mq and by vacuum evaporation ( ve ) techniques .",
    "et al_. @xcite studied the _ a_-gese@xmath13 produced by mechanical grinding ( mg ) of its crystalline counterpart and also found some structural differences .",
    "these differences are important because some physicochemical properties can be altered and improved as desired by choosing an appropriate method of preparation .",
    "it is well known that the mechanical alloying technique ( ma ) @xcite introduces a high quantity of disorder and defects in the structure of the materials produced using this process .",
    "thus , in this paper , we investigated the sro and iro of an amorphous ge@xmath0se@xmath1 alloy produced by ma ( ma-_a_-ge@xmath0se@xmath1 ) starting from the elemental powders of ge and se using raman spectroscopy , differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) , x - ray diffraction and reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) simulations @xcite of its xrd @xmath16 .",
    "we were interested in studying two main points .",
    "since it is not obvious that starting from the powders of ge and se and submitting them to a milling process we would obtain an alloy formed by ( ordered ) structural units like cs or es units , first of all we would like to know if the alloy produced by ma contains these units .",
    "besides that , even if these units are formed the sro and the iro of the alloy can be significantly altered by the high quantity of defects and disorder introduced by the ma process when compared to mq samples , for instance .",
    "therefore , the second point is to determine the local structure of the alloy itself , finding coordination numbers and interatomic distances . at our knowledge , this is the first time that such study is reported concerning an _ a_-ge@xmath0se@xmath1 alloy produced by ma .",

    "in addition , the bond - angle distributions @xmath55 can also be determined .",
    "the ma-_a_-ge@xmath0se@xmath1 alloy was produced by considering a binary mixture of high - purity elemental powders of germanium ( alfa aesar 99.999% purity , particle size @xmath56 150 @xmath57 m ) and selenium ( alfa aesar 99.999% purity , particle size @xmath56 150 @xmath57 m ) that was sealed together with several steel balls into a cylindrical steel vial under an argon atmosphere .",

    "the @xmath60 and @xmath61 values were taken from a table compiled by sasaki @xcite .",
    "raman measurements were performed with a t64000 jobin - yvon triple monochromator coupled to a cooled ccd detector and a conventional photon counting system .",

    "first hard sphere simulations without experimental data were carried out to avoid possible memory effects of the initial configurations in the results",

    "these runs led to essentially identical @xmath42 functions , because of the proximity of the atomic numbers and scattering factors of ge and se .",
    "in the next series of simulations we tried to fit the experimental @xmath16 using the nd coordination numbers reported in refs .   or as coordination constraints . in this case we reached a poor agreement between the experimental and the simulated structure factor , indicating that the local structure of ma-_a_-ge@xmath0se@xmath1 is really different from that found in the mq - gese@xmath13 alloy , in agreement with raman results .",

    "the @xmath121 function is very noisy because of the very small number of ge - ge pairs in the first shell , but it shows a tendency for angles around 100@xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath122 function has peaks at 5561@xmath62 and a broad distribution from 99 to 118@xmath62 , with a maximum at 103@xmath62 .",
    "the internal se - se - se angles in perfect tetrahedra are found at @xmath123 , the se - se - se angle in trigonal se is seen at 103@xmath62 and the angles in small se chains and rings @xcite can be found at 90116@xmath62 .",
    "thus , the @xmath122 function indicates that the tetrahedra in ma-_a_-ge@xmath0se@xmath1 are slightly distorted and se chains and rings are formed , in agreement with rs results and with the previous analyses of the @xmath31 functions .",
    "the @xmath124 function is very similar to the @xmath122 function , showing peaks at 58@xmath62 and 105@xmath62 , which is close to the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109@xmath62 .    the @xmath125 function peaks at about 58@xmath62 and 106@xmath62 .",

    "the @xmath8 functions above confirm that distorted tetrahedral units are formed in ma-_a_-ge@xmath0se@xmath1 , with a clear preference for cs units .",
    "these units seem to be connected by se - se bridges , forming small chains and rings , as pointed out by the rs data .",
    "to summarize , we can conclude that the amorphous ge@xmath0se@xmath1 alloy can be produced by ma starting from the elemental powders of ge and se , but the structure of the alloy is different from that found in mq- , ve- or mg - gese@xmath13 samples , making clear the importance of the preparation technique .",

    "these units seem to be connected by se - se bridges , as suggested by the high number of these pairs in the first shell , by the increase in the distance between ge - ge second neighbors , by the @xmath129 functions and also by rs vibrational data .",
    "these differences in the sro affect the iro of the alloy , and this causes the low intensity of the fsdp in @xmath16 of ma-_a_-ge@xmath0se@xmath1 when compared to the mq - gese@xmath13 alloy @xcite .",
    "the low intensity of the fsdp in @xmath16 can be traced back to the partial @xmath108 factor , whose fsdp is related to the es units , which are found in a small quantity in the alloy .",
