    "there is no wave function overlap between graphene and bi@xmath3se@xmath4 , leaving the two materials electronically decoupled .",
    "the graphene s linearly dispersive bands ( in blue in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) at each of the valleys ( dirac k - points ) are 2-fold spin - degenerate , with the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) bands just touch each other .",

    "now the graphene valleys are placed together with the bi@xmath3se@xmath4 surface states around the @xmath2 point due to the bands folding in the supercell structure . as the graphene electronic gap increases further upon a reduction of @xmath5",
    "[ see @xmath22   , fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) ] , the @xmath18 cone lifts up in energy but the tip of the @xmath16 one remains pinned at @xmath20 .",
    "the topologically protected surface states of bi@xmath3se@xmath4 ( one per surface ) are positioned in the vicinity of the tip of the @xmath16 cone . for separations",
    "@xmath23    these surface states form a doubly - degenerate state since the two surfaces are equivalent for the unperturbed ti slab . for distances",
    "@xmath24    the symmetry of the ti slab breaks due to the vicinity of the graphene layer and the degeneracy of the surface states is lifted .",
    "the ti surface state in contact with graphene moves up in energy at @xmath2 by about 0.11  ev for @xmath25   .",
    "importantly , the graphene states that are pinned at @xmath14 start to couple with the surface state and , for @xmath26   , the 4-fold degeneracy of the @xmath16 cone is lifted . here",

    "[ fig2](d ) ] and the bi@xmath3se@xmath4 surface state at the opposite side of the interface ( placed directly beneath the mixed band at @xmath2 ) cross @xmath20 .    intriguingly , such newly formed mixed graphene / bi@xmath3se@xmath4 band presents a helical spin - texture , demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) .",
    "this is a sufficient condition for disabling back - scattering of charge carriers  @xcite , and it is not the case in a pristine graphene sheet .",
    "in fact , defects in graphene allow hopping of charge carriers between two valleys , which causes back - scattering due to their opposite winding numbers .",
    "in contrast , hopping is impossible in systems with only one valley and a helical spin - texture , which is the case for graphene / bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "note , however , that the existence of the helical spin texture and the lack of back - scattering do not necessarily mean topological protection of the material s electronic state  @xcite .",
    "the supercell structure causes the folding of the second brillouin zone ( bz ) of primitive graphene into the first and consequently the migration of the graphene valleys from k to @xmath2 .",
    "thus two 4-fold degenerate cones touching at @xmath20 are formed .",
    "the bands from the two valleys have opposite topological charges , which causes their mutual annihilation  @xcite .",
    "this manifests itself in the opening in graphene of a band - gap [ see fig .  [",
    "fig2](b ) and ( c ) ] , much larger than that estimated for thallium adatoms deposition @xcite .    after having determined the emergence of a mixed graphene / bi@xmath0se@xmath1 band , we now analyze in detail its electronic properties .",
    "the electron density integrated over a narrow energy region around @xmath14 and projected over the mixed state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "this is clearly localized over graphene and , to a smaller degree , over the se atoms in contact to graphene .",
    "since such state presents a dominating c-@xmath27 and se-@xmath27 orbital contribution and it is delocalized in the plane of the interface , it presents @xmath16 conjugation .",
    "a more quantitative insight is obtained by plotting the charge density averaged over planes parallel to the interface [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ] .",
    "this shows that , while the contribution to the electron density originating from the bulk is small , a much larger portion is provided by the two surface states at both sides of the composite . at the free bi@xmath0se@xmath1 surface",
    "the surface state is distributed mainly over the first four atomic layers [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] . in contrast , at the graphene / bi@xmath0se@xmath1 interface the electron density migrates from the ti to graphene .",
    "notably this feature resembles closely the one reported for the interface between the normal metal sb@xmath0se@xmath1 and the ti bi@xmath0se@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "also the behavior is similar to the topologization of znm ( m = s , se , te ) upon deposition on bi@xmath0se@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "let us now spend a few words on the possibility of inducing a topological state in graphene due to its proximity and bonding to bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "firstly , we wish to point out that our results do not indicate that graphene converts into a 2d topological insulator upon its deposition on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , but simply that a topologically - protected hybrid state is formed .",
    "a 2d ti is an insulator in the bulk presenting topologically protected 1d states at the edges of a ribbon , as in the case of bi thin films on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 surface @xcite .",
    "in contrast here the fermi surface of graphene undergoes a transition from a zero - band gap semiconducting phase ( region c ) , prone to gap opening due to defects and impurities , to a topologically protected metallic phase ( region a ) via an insulating phase ( region b ) .",
    "a fundamental property of 3d tis is the existence of an odd number of surface bands around @xmath14 .",
    "another property is that the topology of the surface states is such to connect the bulk valence band to the conduction one due to the parity inversion originated by the strong spin - orbit coupling . in the graphene / bi@xmath0se@xmath1 complex only one conical band is present at the fermi level .",
    "importantly this band belongs to the surface state of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 with considerable contribution of graphene around @xmath14 , while the other parts of the state ( in particular the ends that connect to the valance and the conduction bulk ti states ) still fully belong to the ti . thus the topologically protected surface ti state can be understood as a carrier of the induced graphene states , and the intrinsic topological protection of ti surface state provides the robustness to graphene as well .",
    "the topologically - protected hybrid state does not simply correspond to the penetration of the one of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 edge states into graphene .",
    "in that situation interaction between bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and graphene is not present .",
    "in contrast here the interaction is strong and , in fact , as @xmath5 decreases first it is responsible for the opening of a band - gap in graphene and then for creating the topologically - protected hybrid state .",
    "this behaviour is very similar to that of the sb@xmath0se@xmath1/bi@xmath0se@xmath1  @xcite and the znm / bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ( m = s , se , te )  @xcite interfaces , in which a topological state is transferred to the normal metal because of proximity .    as a final characterization of the hybrid state",
    "we have probed its scattering properties .",
    "in particular we have performed transport calculations , with the smeagol code  @xcite , for the composite along the direction parallel to the graphene sheet . note",
    "that smeagol provides an electronic structure for the composite essentially identical to that obtained with vasp .",
    "we have then calculated the system conductance for a defect - free system and for a the case where approximately 17% or 33% vacancies counting atoms are introduced along the direction perpendicular to the transport [ see fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ] .",
    "note that these are extremely large concentrations and here they serve the purpose to prove the topological protection of the surface state . from fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) one can observe that 17% of vacancies do not affect the conductance around @xmath14 indicating that the state is indeed strongly protected against back - scattering .",
    "even for a 33% concentration little reduction of the conductance is found at around @xmath14 , although the graphene layer is almost cut in two parts .",
    "note , however , that the inclusion of impurities reduces significantly the conductance for energies away from the fermi level , i.e. away the topologically protected part of the graphene spectrum .",
    "this demonstrate that the transport is indeed through graphene and it is protected against back - scattering at around the fermi level .    in concluding we would like to propose an experiment , which may prove the transfer of the topologically protected state to graphene",
    ". a schematic view of the proposed setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , in which a graphene sheet is contacted only in part to bi@xmath0se@xmath1 while the rest remains free - standing .",
    "defects are then introduced in graphene only at the contacting region for instance by electrons or ions irradiation  @xcite .",
    "if there exists topological protection in graphene at the contact region , the electronic transport through such system will not show a conductance reduction relative to that of the defect - free case .",
    "one may still argue that the transport through the irradiated region is via the topologically protected surface state of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 rather than through the defective graphene .",
    "however , in this case the charge carriers need to hop between the ti and the contacting graphene [ red arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] in order to continue their flow through the bare graphene and close the electric circuit .",
    "this will degrade the conductance .",
    "in contrast if the transport is carried solely by states of the ( defected ) graphene the effects of hopping will be eliminated by the proposed geometry setup .        throughout the paper",
    "we have presented results as a function of the graphene / bi@xmath0se@xmath1 distance , therefore we would like to close this section by briefly discussing what equilibrium distance one can expect .",
    "unfortunately this turns out to be a difficult problem .",
    "the exact binding distance is determined by a balance between covalent and van der waals forces .",
    "these latter ones are not captured by dft local / semi - local exchange and correlation functionals and in fact we find that the two materials do not bind when the calculation is done at the generalized gradient approximation level  @xcite .",
    "this contrasts reality where the graphene / bi@xmath0se@xmath1 exists as it has been experimentally fabricated by few groups  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the inclusion of van der waals forces at the level of local dft  @xcite does not improve the situation , as screening prevents an accurate evaluation of the binding energy in layered compounds  @xcite .",
    "however we expect the equilibrium graphene / bi@xmath0se@xmath1 distance to be close to the sum of se and c covalent radii , which amounts to 2 .",
    "this is well within region a [ see fig.[fig1](c ) ] , i.e. when the hybrid surface state forms . besides",
    ", external pressure may be introduced for tuning the desired separation .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the electronic properties of graphene in contact to bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "three phases have been identified , depending on the graphene / bi@xmath0se@xmath1 separation . for @xmath28   ,",
    "the electronic structure of the composite is simply the superposition of those of the constituents . the second phase , obtained for 2.4    @xmath29  3.0   , witnesses the opening of a band - gap in graphene , due to the annihilation of graphene states with opposite winding numbers .",
    "the third phase , when graphene and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 chemically bind , is the most interesting , as a topologically protected state with charge distribution mostly localized on graphene forms .",
