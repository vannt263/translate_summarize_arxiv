    "we have developed a model ( grasil , _ http://grana.pd.astro.it_ ) for the sed of galaxies including dust effects @xcite .",
    "we consider a geometry more complex and realistic than previous treatments , and take into account 3 distinct environments where stellar radiation interacts with dust ( figure  [ cartoon2f_mc ] ) : ( 1 ) * molecular clouds ( mcs ) + young stars * ( clumped component ) , ( 2 ) * diffuse ism ( cirrus ) + older stars * ( diffuse component ) , ( 3 ) agb envelopes ( included in the ssp library , bressan et al . , 1998 ) . therefore both stars and dust have a _ realistic 2-phase distribution_. the association between young stars and mcs is modelled to mimic the birth of stars in mcs and their gradual escape as they grow old : the fraction of each ssp energy radiated inside mcs is decreased with its age ( figure  [ cartoon2f_mc ] ) .",
    "it is the first time that such an _ age - dependent or selective extinction _ is modelled ( see granato et al .",
    ", 2000 for interesting applications ) .",
    "the dust model consists of normal grains in thermal equilibrium , small grains fluctuating in temperature and pah molecules .",
    "we have extended our model to the radio .",
    "the thermal radio emission is proportional to the production rate of ionizing photons :    @xmath0    the non thermal radio emission is the sum of a dominating term , proportional to the supernova rate ( calibrated on the galactic value ) and one due to supernova remnants ( based on the @xmath1d relation ) :    @xmath2    see bressan ( these proceedings ) and bressan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for details .",
    "as an example , the fit to the starburst galaxy m82 is shown in figure  [ m82r ] .",
    "note that the inclusion of the radio emission potentially ( with the adopted calibration ) helps in constraining the starburst age , due to the different timescales involved in the ir ( ongoing sfr , last few myrs ) and radio ( recent sfr , a few @xmath3 yrs ago ) emission .",
    "the sub - mm to radio spectral index has been recently used to estimate the redshift of sub - mm selected galaxies ( e.g.  carilli & yun 2000 ) . exploiting our model it is possible to investigate the dependence of this index on the evolutionary status of galaxies . in figure  [ qzarp ]",
    "the @xmath4m-@xmath5 ghz spectral index is plotted vs redshift using the model fitting the sed of arp220 ( figure  [ m82r ] , this seems to be representative of the scuba galaxies , e.g.  barger et al . , 1999 ) , but for different ages of the starburt .",
    "the redshift dispersion around z=2 ( the typical value estimated for scuba galaxies ) is @xmath6 . to reduce this dispersion",
    ", we propose to use a radio - radio spectral index ( e.g.  @xmath7-@xmath5 ghz ) , almost independent of z , in combination with the previous one . indeed , with the linear combination shown figure  [ qzarp ] , the @xmath8 due to the evolution becomes 0.5 around z=2 .",
    "recently we have started to include in our model the stellar contribution to the x - ray emission of galaxies .",
    "our starting point has been the work by van bever & vanbeveren ( 2000 ) .",
    "they find that the dominating stellar components in the x - ray for starburst galaxies are massive binaries with a black hole or a neutron star as a primary , and an ob star as a secondary either in the h - shell burning phase or on the main sequence , and pulsars .",
    "we have included these components , and the contribution from supernova remnants , in the ssp library .",
    "the main uncertainties in the predicted output are ( figure  [ sspx ] ) : the binary fraction , the minimum mass for bh formation and the initial spin period @xmath9 of pulsars ( whose @xmath10 ) .",
    "a further uncertainty is the sed to assigne to each component . a first attempt for the stellar x - ray sed expected from the uv - to - radio fitting model for m82 , is shown in figure  [ sspx ] ."
