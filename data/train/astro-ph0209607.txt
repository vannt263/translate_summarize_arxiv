    "low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; heckman 1980 ) are found in many nearby bright galaxies ( e.g. , ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a ) .",
    "extensive studies at various wavelengths have shown that type 1 liners ( liner 1s , i.e. , those galaxies having broad h@xmath3 and possibly other broad balmer lines in their nuclear optical spectra ) are powered by a low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) with a bolometric luminosity less than @xmath14 ergs s@xmath2 ( ho et al .",
    "2001 ; terashima , ho , & ptak 2000a ; ho et al .",
    "1997b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy source of liner 2s is likely to be heterogeneous .",
    "some liner 2s show clear signatures of the presence of an agn , while others are most probably powered by stellar processes , and the luminosity ratio @xmath6/@xmath15 can be used to discriminate between these different power sources ( e.g. , prez - olea & colina 1996 ; maoz et al . 1998 ; terashima et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that currently there are only a few liner 2s known to host an obscured agn ( e.g. , turner et al .",
    "this paucity of obscured agn in liners may indicate that liner 2s are not simply a low - luminosity extension of luminous seyfert 2s , which generally show heavy obscuration with a column density averaging @xmath10 @xmath16 @xmath11 @xmath12 ( e.g. , turner et al . 1997 ) .",
    "alternatively , biases against finding heavily obscured llagns may be important .",
    "for example , objects selected through optical emission lines or x - ray fluxes are probably biased in favor of less absorbed ones , even if one uses the x - ray band above 2 kev .",
    "in contrast , radio observations , particularly at high frequency , are much less affected by absorption .",
    "although an optical spectroscopic survey must first be done to find the emission lines characteristic of a llagn , follow up radio observations can clarify the nature of the activity .",
    "for example , vlbi observations of some llagns have revealed a compact nuclear radio source with @xmath17 k , which is an unambiguous indicator of the presence of an active nucleus and can not be produced by starburst activity ( e.g. , falcke et al . 2000 ; ulvestad & ho 2001 ) .",
    "a number of surveys of seyfert galaxies at sub arcsecond resolution have been made with the vla ( ulvestad & wilson 1989 and references therein ; kukula et al .",
    "1995 ; nagar et al . 1999 ; thean et al .",
    "2000 ; schmitt et al . 2001 ; ho & ulvestad 2001 ) and other interferometers ( roy et al . 1994 ; morganti et al .",
    "1999 ) , but much less work has been done on the nuclear radio emission of liners .",
    "nagar et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have reported a vla 2 cm radio survey of all 96 llagns within a distance of 19 mpc .",
    "these llagns come from the palomar spectroscopic survey of bright galaxies ( ho et al .",
    "1997a ) . as a pilot study of the x - ray properties of llagns ,",
    "we report here a _",
    "chandra _ survey of a subset , comprising 15 galaxies , of nagar et al s ( 2002 ) sample .",
    "fourteen of these galaxies have a compact nuclear radio core with a flat or inverted radio spectrum ( nagar et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we have detected 13 of the galactic nuclei with _",
    "chandra_. we also examine the `` radio loudness '' of our sample and compare it with other classes of agn .",
    "a new measure of `` radio loudness '' is developed , in which the 5 ghz radio luminosity is compared with the 210 kev x - ray luminosity ( @xmath9=@xmath18 ( 5 ghz)/@xmath19(210 kev ) ) rather than with the b - band optical luminosity ( @xmath20(5 ghz)/@xmath8(b ) ) , as is usually done .",
    "@xmath9 has the advantage that it can be measured for highly absorbed nuclei ( @xmath10 up to several times @xmath11 @xmath12 ) which would be totally obscured ( @xmath21 up to a few hundred mag for the galactic gas to dust ratio ) at optical wavelengths , and that the compact , hard x - ray source in a llagn is less likely to be confused with emission from stellar - powered processes than is an optical nucleus .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sample , observations , and data reduction are described in section 2 .",
    "imaging results and x - ray source detections are given in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents spectral results .",
    "the power source , obscuration in llagns , and radio loudness of llagns are discussed in section 5 .",
    "section 6 summarizes the findings .",
    "we use a hubble constant of @xmath22 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and a deceleration parameter of @xmath23 throughout this paper .",
    "our sample is based on the vla observations by nagar et al .",
    "their sample of 48 objects consists of 22 liners , 18 transition objects , which show optical spectra intermediate between liners and nuclei , and eight low - luminosity seyferts selected from the optical spectroscopic survey of ho et al .",

    "one object ( the liner 2 ngc 4550 ) has a flat spectrum radio source at a position significantly offset from the optical nucleus .",
    "this object was added as an example of a liner without a detected radio core . the target list and",
    "some basic data for the final sample are summarized in table 1 .",

    "eight objects were observed in our guaranteed time observation program and the rest of the objects were taken from the _ chandra _ archives .",
    "the eight objects were observed in 1/8 sub - frame mode ( frame time 0.4 s ) to minimize effects of pileup ( e.g. , davis 2001 ) .",
    "1/2 sub - frame modes were used for three objects .",
    "ciao 2.2.1 and caldb 2.7 were used to reduce the data . in the following analysis ,",

    "some off - nuclear sources are also seen in some fields .",
    "the source detection algorithm `` wavdetect '' in the ciao package was applied to detect these nuclear and off - nuclear sources , where a detection threshold of @xmath27 and wavelet scales of 1 , @xmath28 , 2 , @xmath29 , 4 , @xmath30 , 8 , @xmath31 , and 16 pixels were used .",
    "source detections were performed in the three energy bands 0.58 kev ( full band ) , 0.52 kev ( soft band ) , and 28 kev ( hard band ) .",
    "the resulting source lists and raw images were examined by eye to exclude spurious detections .",
    "the source and background counts were also determined by manual photometry and compared with the results of wavdetect . in the few cases that the two methods gave discrepant results",
    ", we decided to use the results of the manual photometry after inspection of the raw images .",
    "some sources were detected in only one or two energy bands . in such cases , we calculated the upper limits on the source counts in the undetected band(s ) at the 95% confidence level by interpolating the values in table 2 of kraft , burrows , & nousek ( 1991 ) .",
    "table 2 shows the positions , detected counts , band ratios ( hard / soft counts ) , fluxes and luminosities in the 210 kev band of the nuclear sources .",
    "the same parameters for off - nuclear sources with signal - to - noise ratios greater than three are summarized in table 3 . for bright objects ( @xmath32 40 counts ) ,",
    "the fluxes were measured by spectral fits presented in the next section . for faint objects ,",
    "fluxes were determined by assuming the galactic absorption column density and power law spectra , with photon indices determined from the band ratios .",
    "when only lower or upper limits on the band ratio were available , a photon index of 2 was assumed if the limit is consistent with @xmath33 .",
    "when the band ratio is inconsistent with @xmath33 , the upper or lower limit is used to determine the photon index .",
    "luminosities were calculated only if the source is spatially inside the optical host galaxy as indicated by comparing the position with the optical image of the digitized sky survey .",
    "possible identifications for off - nuclear sources are also given in the last column of table 3 .",
    "the positions of the x - ray nuclei coincide with the radio core positions to within the positional accuracy of _ chandra_. the nominal separations between the x - ray and radio nuclei are in the range 0.05  0.95@xmath34 .      inspection of the images shows that the nucleus in most objects appears to be unresolved , while some objects show faint extended emission .",

    "the nuclear regions ( 10 arcsec scale ) of the other galaxies look compact to within the current photon statistics .",
    "more extended diffuse emission at larger scales ( @xmath39 ) is seen in a few objects .",
    "the nuclei of ngc 2787 and ngc 4203 are embedded in soft diffuse emission with diameters of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "ngc 4579 shows soft diffuse emission with a similar morphology to the circumnuclear star forming ring , in addition to a very bright nucleus ( see also eracleous et al .",
    "ngc 4565 shows extended emission along the galactic plane .",
    "ngc 5866 has soft extended emission @xmath42 ( 2 kpc ) in diameter and no x - ray nucleus is detected ( table 2 ) .",
    "any diffuse emission associated with the other galaxies is much fainter .",
    "spectral fits were performed for the relatively bright objects  those with @xmath32 40 detected counts in the 0.58 kev band .",
    "the spectrum of one fainter object ( ngc 4548 ) showing a large ( = hard ) hardness ratio was also fitted .",
    "some objects are so bright that pileup effects are significant .",
    "column 7 of table 1 gives the count rates per ccd read - out frame time and can be used to estimate the significance of pileup . in the two objects",

    "the pileup effect for the three objects with the largest count rate per frame ( ngc 4203 , ngc 4579 , and ngc 5033 ) is serious and we did not attempt detailed spectral fits .",
    "instead , we use the spectra and fluxes measured with _ asca _ for these three objects ( terashima et al .",

    "a power - law model modified by absorption was applied and acceptable fits were obtained in all cases ( fig .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the nuclear sources are given in table 4 .",
    "the observed fluxes and luminosities ( the latter corrected for absorption ) in the 210 kev band are shown in table 2 .",
    "the results for a few bright off - nuclear sources are presented in the appendix .",
    "the photon indices of the nuclear sources are generally consistent with the typical values observed in llagns ( photon index @xmath44 , e.g. , terashima et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b ) , although errors are quite large due to the limited photon statistics .",
    "the spectral slope of ngc 6500 ( @xmath45 ) is somewhat steeper than is typical of llagns .",
    "this may indicate that there is soft x - ray emission from a source other than the agn and/or the intrinsic slope of the agn is steep .",
    "one galaxy ( ngc 3169 , a liner 2 ) has a large absorption column ( @xmath10=@xmath46 @xmath12 ) , while two galaxies ( ngc 4548 , a liner 2 , and ngc 3226 , a liner 1.9 ) show substantial absorption ( @xmath47 @xmath12 , and @xmath48 @xmath12 , respectively ) .",
    "others have small column densities which are consistent with ` type 1 ' agns .",
    "no meaningful limit on the equivalent width of an fe k@xmath3 line was obtained for any of the objects because of limited photon statistics in the hard x - ray band .",
    "one object  ngc 2787  has only 8 detected photons in the 0.58 kev band and is too faint to obtain spectral information .",
    "a photon index of 2.0 and the galactic absorption of @xmath49 @xmath12 were assumed to calculate the flux and luminosity which are shown in table 2 .",
    "an x - ray nucleus is detected in all the objects except for ngc 4550 and ngc 5866 .",
    "we test whether the detected x - ray sources are the high energy extension of the continuum source which powers the optical emission lines by examining the luminosity ratio @xmath6/@xmath15 .",
    "the h@xmath3 luminosities ( @xmath15 ) were taken from ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) and the reddening was estimated from the balmer decrement for narrow lines and corrected using the reddening curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) , assuming the intrinsic h@xmath3/h@xmath50 flux ratio = 3.1 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities ( corrected for absorption ) in the @xmath51 kev band are used .",
    "the h@xmath3 luminosities and logarithm of the luminosity ratios @xmath6/@xmath15 are shown in table 5 .",
    "the @xmath6/@xmath15 ratios of most objects are in the range of agns ( @xmath52 @xmath6/@xmath15 @xmath16 12 ) and in good agreement with the strong correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath15 for llagns , luminous seyferts , and quasars presented in terashima et al .",
    "( 2000a ) and ho et al .",
    "this indicates that their optical emission lines are predominantly powered by a llagn .",
    "note that this correlation is not an artifact of distance effects , as shown in terashima et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "the four objects ngc 2787 , ngc 4550 , ngc 5866 , and ngc 6500 , however , have much lower @xmath6/@xmath15 ratios ( @xmath52 @xmath6/@xmath15 .5ex0 ) than expected from the correlation ( @xmath52 @xmath6/@xmath15 @xmath53 ) , and their x - ray luminosities are insufficient to power the h@xmath3 emission ( terashima et al .",
    "this x - ray faintness could indicate one or more of several possibilities such as ( 1 ) an agn is the power source , but is heavily absorbed at energies above 2 kev , ( 2 ) an agn is the power source , but is currently switched - off or in a faint state , and ( 3 ) the optical narrow emission lines are powered by some source(s ) other than an agn .",
    "we briefly discuss these three possibilities in turn",
    ".    if an agn is present in these x - ray faint objects and absorbed in the hard energy band above 2 kev , only scattered and/or highly absorbed x - rays would be observed , and then the intrinsic luminosity would be much higher than that observed . this can account for the low @xmath6/@xmath15 ratios and high radio to x - ray luminosity ratios ( @xmath54(5 ghz)/@xmath6 ; table 5 and section 5.3 ) . if the intrinsic x - ray luminosities are about one or two orders of magnitude higher than those observed , as is often inferred for seyfert 2 galaxies ( turner et al .",
    "1997 , awaki et al .",
    "2000 ) , @xmath6/@xmath15 and @xmath54(5 ghz)/@xmath6 become typical of llagns .    alternatively , the agn might be turned off or in a faint state , with a higher activity in the past being inferred from the optical emission lines , whose emitting region is far from the nucleus ( e.g. , eracleous et al .",
    "also , the radio observations were made a few years before the _ chandra _ ones .",
    "this scenario might thus explain their relatively low @xmath6/@xmath15 ratios and their relatively high @xmath55/@xmath6 ratios .",
    "if this is the case , the size of the radio core can be used to constrain the era of the active phase in the recent past .",
    "the upper limits on the size of the core estimated from the beam size ( @xmath56 2.5 mas ) are 0.16 , 0.19 , and 0.48 pc for ngc 2787 , ngc 5866 , and ngc 6500 , respectively ( falcke et al .",
    "therefore , the agn must have been active until @xmath570.52 , @xmath570.60 , and @xmath571.6 years , respectively , before the vlba observations ( made in 1997 june ) and inactive at the epochs ( 2000 jan  2002 jan , see table 1 ) of the x - ray observations .",
    "this is an ad hoc proposal and such abrupt declines of activity are quite unusual , but it can not be completely excluded .",
    "it may also be possible that the ionized gas inferred from the optical emission lines is ionized by some sources other than an agn , such as hot stars .",
    "if the observed x - rays reflect the intrinsic luminosities of the agn , a problem with the agn scenario for the three objects ngc 2787 , ngc 5866 , and ngc 6500 is that these galaxies have very large @xmath18(5 ghz)/@xmath6 ratios , and would thus be among the radio loudest llagns .",
    "the presence of hot stars in the nuclear region of ngc 6500 is suggested by uv spectroscopy ( maoz et al .",
    "maoz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) studied the energy budget for ngc 6500 by using the h@xmath3 and uv luminosity at 1300 a and showed that the observed uv luminosity is insufficient to power the h@xmath3 luminosity even if a stellar population with the salpeter initial mass function and a high mass cutoff of 120@xmath58 are assumed .",
    "this result indicates that a power source in addition to hot stars must contribute significantly , and supports the obscured agn interpretation discussed above .    the first possibility , i.e. , an obscured low - luminosity agn as the source of the x - ray emission , seems preferable for ngc 2787 , ngc 5866 and ngc 6500 , although some other source(s ) may contribute to the optical emission lines .",
    "additional lines of evidence which support the presence of an agn include the fact that all three of these galaxies ( ngc 2787 , ngc 5866 , and ngc 6500 ) have vlbi - detected , sub - pc scale , nuclear radio core sources ( falcke et al .",
    "2000 ) , a broad h@xmath3 component ( in ngc 2787 , and an ambiguous detection in ngc 5866 ; ho et al .",
    "1997b ) , a variable radio core in ngc 2787 , and a jet - like linear structure in a high - resolution radio map of ngc 6500 with the vlba ( falcke et al .",
    "only an upper limit to the x - ray flux is obtained for ngc 5866 .",
    "if an x - ray nucleus is present in this galaxy and its luminosity is only slightly below the upper limit , this source could be an agn obscured by a column density @xmath10@xmath59 @xmath12 or larger .",
    "if the apparent x - ray luminosity of the nucleus of ngc 5866 is _ much _ lower than the observed upper limit , and the intrinsic x - ray luminosity conforms to the typical @xmath6/@xmath15 ratio for llagn ( @xmath52 @xmath6/@xmath15 @xmath60 ) , then the x - ray source must be almost completely obscured .",
    "the optical classification ( transition object ) suggests the presence of an ionizing source other than an agn , so the low observed @xmath6/@xmath15 ratio could alternatively be a result of enhanced h@xmath3 emission powered by this other ionizing source .",
    "the x - ray results presented above show that the presence of a flat ( or inverted ) spectrum compact radio core is a very good indicator of the presence of an agn even if its luminosity is very low . on the other hand , ngc 4550 , which does not possess a radio core , shows no evidence for the presence of an agn and all the three possibilities discussed above are viable . if the _ rosat _ detection is real ( halderson et al .",
    "2001 ) , the time variability between the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ fluxes may indicate the presence of an agn ( see appendix ) .",
    "it is notable that type 2 liners without a flat spectrum compact radio core may be heterogeneous in nature .",
    "for instance , some liner 2s without a compact radio core ( e.g. , ngc 404 and transition 2 object ngc 4569 ) are most probably driven by stellar processes ( maoz et al .",
    "1998 ; terashima et al . 2000b ; eracleous et al . 2002 ) .      in our sample",
    ", we found at least three highly absorbed llagns ( ngc 3169 , ngc 3226 , and ngc 4548 ) . in addition , if the x - ray faint objects discussed in section 5.1 are indeed agns , they are most probably highly absorbed with @xmath10@xmath61 @xmath12 . among these absorbed objects ,",
    "ngc 2787 is classified as a liner 1.9 , ngc 3169 , ngc 4548 , and ngc 6500 as liner 2s , and ngc 5866 as a transition 2 object .",
    "thus , heavily absorbed liner 2s , of which few are known , are found in the present observations demonstrating that radio selection is a valuable technique for finding obscured agns . along with",
    "heavily obscured llagns known in low - luminosity seyfert 2s ( e.g. , ngc 2273 , ngc 2655 , ngc 3079 , ngc 4941 , and ngc 5194 ; terashima et al .",
    "2002a ) , our observations show that at least some type 2 llagns are simply low - luminosity counterparts of luminous seyferts in which heavy absorption is often observed ( e.g. , risaliti , maiolino , & salvati 1999 ) .",
    "however , some liner 2s ( e.g. , ngc 4594 , terashima et al . 2002a ; ngc 4374 , finoguenov & jones 2001 ; ngc 4486 , wilson & yang 2002 ) and low - luminosity seyfert 2s ( ngc 3147 ; section 4 and appendix ) show no strong absorption .",
    "therefore , the orientation - dependent unified scheme ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) does not always apply to agns in the low - luminosity regime , as suggested by terashima et al .",
    ".      combination of x - ray and radio observations is valuable for investigating a number of areas of agn physics , including the `` radio loudness '' , the origin of jets , and the structure of accretion disks . low - luminosity agns ( liners and low - luminosity seyfert galaxies ) are thought to be radiating at very low eddington ratios ( @xmath62/@xmath63 ) and may possess an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; see e.g. , quataert 2002 for a recent review ) .",
    "a study of radio loudness in llagns can constrain the jet production efficiency by an adaf - type disk .",
    "earlier studies have suggested that llagns tend to be radio loud compared to more luminous seyferts based on the spectral energy distributions of seven llagns ( ho 1999 ) and , for a larger sample , on the conventional definition of radio loudness @xmath64(5 ghz)/@xmath8(b ) ( the subscript `` o '' , which stands for optical , is usually omitted but we use it here to distinguish from @xmath9  see below ) , with @xmath65 being radio loud ( kellermann et al .",
    "1989 , 1994 ; visnovsky et al . 1992 ; stocke et al . 1992 ; ho & peng 2001 ) .",
    "ho & peng ( 2001 ) measured the luminosities of the nuclei by spatial analysis of optical images obtained with _",
    "hst _ to reduce the contribution from stellar light .",
    "a caveat in the use of optical measurements for the definition of radio loudness is extinction , which will lead to an overestimate of @xmath66 if not properly allowed for .",
    "although ho & peng ( 2001 ) used only type 11.9 objects , some objects of these types show high absorption columns in their x - ray spectra . in this subsection ,",
    "we study radio loudness by comparing radio and hard x - ray luminosities . since the unabsorbed luminosity for objects with @xmath10 .5ex@xmath11 @xmath12 can be reliably measured in the 210 kev band , which is accessible to _ asca _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _",
    "chandra _ , and",
    "such columns correspond to @xmath21 .5ex50 mag , it is clear that replacement of optical by hard x - ray luminosity potentially yields considerable advantages .",
    "in addition , the high spatial resolutions of _ xmm - newton _ and especially _ chandra _ usually allow the nuclear x - ray emission to be identified unambiguously , while the optical emission of llagn can be confused by surrounding starlight .    in the following analysis ,",
    "radio data at 5 ghz taken from the literature are used since fluxes at this frequency are widely available for various classes of objects .",

    "this is related to the fact that luminous objects show a more prominent `` big blue bump '' in their spectra .",

    "that none of the pg quasars used here shows a high absorption column in its x - ray spectrum below 10 kev .",
    "the definition of radio loudness using the hard x - ray flux ( @xmath85 ) appears to be more robust than that using the optical flux because x - rays are less affected by both extinction at optical wavelengths and the detailed shape of the blue bump , as noted above .",
    "further , measurements of nuclear x - ray fluxes of seyferts and llagns with _",

    "this is a confirmation of ho & peng s ( 2001 ) finding .",
    "note , however , that our sample is not complete in any sense , and this radio - loud fraction should be measured using a more complete sample . since radio emission in llagns is likely to be dominated by emission from jets ( nagar et al .",
    "2001 ; ulvestad & ho 2001 ) , these results suggest that , in llagn , the fraction of the accretion energy that powers a jet , as opposed to electromagnetic radiation , is larger than in more luminous seyfert galaxies and quasars . since llagns are thought to have an adaf - type accretion flow , such might indicate that an adaf can produce jets more efficiently than the geometrically thin disk believed present in more luminous seyferts .    the three llagns with the largest @xmath9 in fig .",
    "4 are the three x - ray faint objects discussed in section 5.1 ( ngc 2787 , ngc 5866 , and ngc 6500 ) and which are most probably obscured agns .",
    "if their intrinsic x - ray luminosities are 12 orders of magnitude higher than those observed , their values of @xmath9 become smaller by this factor and are then in the range of other llagns .",
    "even if we exclude these three llagns , the radio loudness of llagns is distributed over a wide range : the radio - loudest llagns have @xmath9 values similar to radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars , while some llagns are as radio quiet as radio - quiet quasars .",
    "a comparison with blazars is of interest to compare our sample with objects for which the nuclear emission is known to be dominated by a relativistic jet and thus strongly beamed .",
    "the average @xmath89 for high - energy peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) , low - energy peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) , and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) are 3.10 , 1.27 , and 0.95 , respectively , where we used the average radio and x - ray luminosities for a large sample of blazars given in table 3 of donato et al .",
    "the average @xmath76 for hbls is similar to that for llagns in our sample , while the latter two classes are about two orders of magnitude more radio loud than llagns .",
    "although llagns and hbls have similar values of @xmath89 , the spectral slope in the x - ray band is different : llagns have a photon index in the range 1.72.0 ( see also terashima et al .",
    "2002 ) , while hbls usually show steeper spectra ( photon index @xmath32 2 , e.g. , fig . 1 in donato et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the x - ray emission is believed to be dominated by synchrotron radiation .",
    "furthermore , blazars with a lower bolometric luminosity tend to have a synchrotron peak at a higher frequency and a steeper x - ray spectral slope than higher bolometric luminosity blazars ( donato et al .",

    "this confirms earlier results based on nuclear luminosities in the optical band , but our results based on hard x - ray measurements are much less affected by obscuration and the detailed shape of the `` big blue bump '' .",
    "we speculate that the increase in @xmath9 as @xmath6 decreases below @xmath91 ergs s@xmath2 may result from the presence of an advection - dominated accretion flow in the inner part of the accretion flow in low - luminosity objects . however , the steep x - ray spectra in our sample of llagns rule out high temperature thermal bremsstrahlung as the x - ray emission mechanism .",
