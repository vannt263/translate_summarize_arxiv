    "in the papers @xcite we have shown how to classify the admissible configurations of the @xmath1-field and the @xmath2-field , in the presence of d - branes that are free from the freed - witten anomaly .",
    "we worked in the framework of type ii superstring theory , and the mathematical language we used is the geometry of gerbes with connection , described via the @xmath0ech hypercohomology of sheaves . in this paper",
    "we summarize how this classification determines the nature of the gauge theory on the world - volume , starting from the definition of `` non - integral vector bundles '' , on which the gauge theory is defined when the b - field is flat .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ nonintegralvb ]",
    "we review the definition of non - integral vector bundles , starting from the case of line bundles . in section [ gaugedbrane ]",
    "we show what are the possible geometrical natures of the gauge theory on a world - volume , within this framework . in section [ residual ]",
    "we describe a residual gauge freedom depending on the topology of the space - time , and we show that it has a link with the twisted k - theory classification of d - brane charges . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a smooth manifold @xmath3 with a good cover @xmath4 .",
    "the group of isomorphism classes of complex line bundles ( with hermitian metric ) is isomorphic to the @xmath0ech cohomology group @xmath5 , for @xmath6 the sheaf of @xmath7-valued smooth functions on @xmath3 . via the exact sequence of sheaves : @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the sheaf of real smooth functions on @xmath3 ) we get an isomorphism @xmath10 . therefore",
    ", a line bundle is completely determined up to isomorphism by its corresponding class in @xmath11 , called first chern class .",
    "if we consider the group of line bundles with connection , it is isomorphic to the @xmath0ech hypercohomology group @xcite : @xmath12 for @xmath13 the sheaf of real - valued differential forms of degree 1 on @xmath3 , and @xmath14 .",
    "taking the exterior differential of the connection 1-forms we can define the curvature , which is a global integral ( up to a multiplicative constant ) 2-form @xmath15 . if @xmath16 is a line bundle with connection , @xmath17 the first chern class and @xmath15 the curvature , then @xmath18_{dr } \\simeq c_{1}(l ) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{z } } \\mathbb{r}$ ] , where @xmath19_{dr}$ ] is the de - rham cohomology class of @xmath15 .",
    "we can consider more generally a `` non - integral line bundle '' , which is represented by transition functions @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , instead of being @xmath22 , is only required to be locally constant .",
    "two set of transition functions are still considered equivalent when they differ by a coboundary of @xmath6 .",
    "such transition functions form a cocycle in the @xmath0ech cochain complex of the quotient sheaf @xmath23 , where @xmath7 denotes the _ constant _ sheaf . hence",
    ", we can generalize the exact sequence to : @xmath24 since a non - integral bundle projects to a class in @xmath25 , via the bockstein map of we can associate to it a first chern class in @xmath26 , which is therefore not necessarily integral .",
    "we can endow a non - integral line bundle with a connection , getting a class in the hypercohomology group : @xmath27 we define the curvature in the same way , and we get a global 2-form @xmath15 which is not necessarily integral any more , since its de - rham cohomology class still corresponds to the ( real ) first chern class of the non - integral line bundle .",
    "we can now define `` non - integral bundles '' of any rank . a rank-@xmath28 vector bundle ( with hermitian metric )",
    "is represented by transition functions @xmath29 , satisfying the cocycle condition .",
    "if we endow it with a connection , it is represented by the transition functions and the connection 1-forms @xmath30 , for @xmath31 the lie algebra of @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 .",
    "the curvature is a local form @xmath34 , whose gauge - transformations are the action of the transition functions by coniugation",
    ". hence we can define the chern classes via the symmetric polynomials @xmath35 , which are invariant by coniugation , as : @xmath36 = [ p_{i}(\\textstyle \\frac{i}{2\\pi } \\displaystyle f)].\\ ] ] as above , we can define a non - integral rank-@xmath28 vector bundle as a class of transition functions @xmath29 such that @xmath21 , instead of being 1 , is locally constant , and its value on a triple intersection belongs to the center of @xmath32 , i.e.  @xmath37 for @xmath38 the identity matrix .",
    "this is a particular case of twisted vector bundle @xcite , since the latter is represented by transition functions such that @xmath21 takes values in the center of @xmath32 , without being locally constant in general .",
    "we can endow a non - integral vector bundle with a connection , which is represented by 1-forms @xmath30 satisfying , as in the ordinary case , @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to show that the gauge transformations of the curvature are still the action by coniugation of the transition functions , contrary to the general case of twisted bundles , so that equations still gives well - defined cohomology classes in @xmath39 , which depends only on the bundle ( not on the connection ) , but they are not necessarily integral .",
    "thus , even the chern character , defined as usual as : @xmath40 = [ { \\textnormal{tr}}\\,\\exp(\\textstyle \\frac{i}{2\\pi } \\displaystyle f)],\\ ] ] in the case of non - integral bundles takes values in a lattice which is different from the one of ordinary vector bundles .",
    "we now show how non - integral bundles are related to the gauge theory on a d - brane or stack of d - branes world - volume , in the framework of type ii superstring theory with non - trivial @xmath2-field in general .",
    "we recall that , for a single d - brane , the world - sheet path - integral measure contains the terms @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the world - sheet , @xmath43 is the trajectory of the world - sheet in the space - time , @xmath44 is the pfaffian of the dirac operator on the world - sheet , coupled to the space - time via @xmath43 , and @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the @xmath1-field and the @xmath2-field .",
    "the term involving the @xmath2-field can be interpreted as the holonomy over @xmath42 of a gerbe with connection @xcite .",
    "we recall that the latter is an element of the hypercohomology group : @xmath45 in this case , @xmath3 is the space - time , the connection 2-forms are the local representatives of the @xmath2-field , while the curvature , which is a global 3-form , is the @xmath46-flux . actually the @xmath2-field should be described in a more refined way @xcite , but this is enough for our purposes . similarly , the pfaffian @xmath44 is a section of a line bundle over the loop space of @xmath47 , which is determined @xcite by a _ flat _",
    "gerbe with connection on the world - volume @xmath47 , called the _ spin@xmath48-gerbe _ , whose first chern class is the third integral stiefel - whitney class @xmath49 , and whose flat holonomy is the second stiefel - whitney class @xmath50 @xcite . since @xmath42 is an open surface , such that @xmath51 , the product of the two terms : @xmath52 is in general a section of a line bundle over the space of maps from @xmath42 to @xmath3 , sending @xmath53 to @xmath47 , and becomes a well - defined number only when the tensor product of the two gerbes on @xmath47 is trivial and trivialized .",
    "if we call @xmath54 \\in h^{3}(x , \\mathbb{z})$ ] the integral first chern class of the @xmath2-field gerbe , it must therefore happen that : @xmath55\\vert_{y } = 0\\ ] ] and the term @xmath56\\vert_{y}$ ] is called _ freed - witten anomaly _",
    "@xcite . in this case , the @xmath1-field provides a reparametrization of the tensor product of the two gerbes , which trivializes it .",
    "therefore , if we represent the @xmath2-field gerbe , restricted to @xmath47 , as @xmath57 and the spin@xmath48 gerbe as @xmath58 , for @xmath59 representing @xmath60 in the cohomology of the constant sheaf @xmath7 , then it must hold that : @xmath61 i.e. : @xmath62 for @xmath63 . since the choice of the representatives is arbitrary ,",
    "we see with the language of @xmath0ech hypercohomology the well - known fact that , in general , @xmath2 and @xmath15 are not gauge - invariant , because , even if they are chosen to be globally defined , they are subject to large gauge transformations @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the situation is different when the @xmath46-flux , restricted to the world - volume , is zero , i.e.  when the @xmath2-field gerbe is flat on the world - volume . in this case",
    ", we can choose a cocycle @xmath66 for the @xmath2-field gerbe on the world - volume : this is clear by analogy with flat line bundles , for which , choosing _ parallel _ sections , the transition functions become locally constant and the connection 1-forms vanish .",
    "in this case , becomes : @xmath67 which is the equation of a _ non - integral _ line bundle .",
    "that s why , in general , when the large gauge transformations can be canonically fixed , we do not always get a gauge theory in the usual sense , but a gauge theory on a non - integral line bundle .",
    "in particular , we miss the information about the torsion part ( e.g.  the aharonov - bohm effect in electromagnetism ) , and the wilson loop of the @xmath1-field is a section of a flat line bundle over the loop space on @xmath47 , rather than a well - defined complex number of modulus @xmath22 , since it compensates in the anomaly of the other two terms .    if it turns out that @xmath68 and that the @xmath2-field gerbe , restricted to @xmath47 , has trivial holonomy , than we can choose transition functions equal to @xmath22 for both the gerbes , so that becomes : @xmath69 only in this case , which is of course the most common one , we get a canonical gauge theory , in the sense that it is defined on a line bundle in the usual sense , so that we recover the information even about the torsion part , and we can define the holonomy of the @xmath1-field over a loop as a number .      for",
    "a stack of d - branes the action becomes @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the path - ordering operator .",
    "the terms involving the @xmath2-field and the pfaffian of the dirac operator remains unchanged , therefore we still need to trivialize the product of the spin@xmath48-gerbe and the @xmath2-field gerbe restricted to the d - brane .",
    "thus we still need that : @xmath72 but this time the coboundary @xmath73 has a different meaning , since the transition functions @xmath74 take values in @xmath32 , thus they are not necessarily a trivialization of @xmath75 in the @xmath6-cohomology . they define a twisted vector bundle .",
    "anyhow , if @xmath76 , then the class @xmath77 \\in h^{2}(y , \\underline{u}(1 ) ) \\simeq h^{3}(y , \\mathbb{z})$ ] must be a _ torsion class _ , because , taking the determinants , we get @xmath78 , and , since @xmath79 takes values in @xmath7 , it follows that @xmath80 is a trivial class .",
    "one can prove that for any torsion class in @xmath81 there exists a corresponding twisted vector bundle @xcite , therefore , if we do not fix the number of d - branes in the stack , equation can be satisfied if an only if @xmath82 $ ] is a torsion class .",
    "hence , if we call @xmath83 $ ] the torsion class @xmath77 $ ] determined by the twisted bundle , the freed - witten anomaly cancellation for a stack of d - branes becomes @xcite : @xmath84\\vert_{y } + [ h ] = w_{3}(y),\\ ] ] which can be satisfied by a suitable @xmath83 $ ] if and only if @xmath54\\vert_{y}$ ] is torsion .",
    "therefore , if we do not impose a constraint on the number of d - brane in the stack , _ the only condition that the freed - witten anomaly imposes on a world - volume is that the @xmath46-flux , restricted to it , is an exact form_. in particular , if @xmath46 is exact on the whole - space time , there are no freed - witten anomalous world - volumes , even if , for some of them , there is a minimum number of d - branes that must be present in the stack , which is bigger than @xmath22",
    ".    even for stack of d - branes , if the @xmath46-flux is not zero when restricted to the d - brane , there are large gauge transformations @xmath64 and @xmath85 , therefore we can not fix a gauge theory on the d - brane . when the @xmath46-flux is @xmath86 on @xmath47 , we can choose a representative @xmath66 for the @xmath2-field gerbe ,",
    "so that equation becomes : @xmath87 this is the equation of a _ non - integral _ vector bundle .",
    "therefore , in the general case , when we can fix a gauge theory on a stack of d - branes , it is a gauge theory on a non - integral vector bundle , which therefore has not necessarily integral chern classes .",
    "of course we miss the information about the torsion part , and the wilson loop of the @xmath1-field is a section of a line bundle over the loop space of @xmath47 , whose anomaly compensates the one of the other two terms of the world - sheet path - integral measure .",
    "we remark that , contrary to the case of a single d - brane , the flat holonomy of the @xmath2-field gerbe on @xmath47 can be _ any class in @xmath88 _ , not necessarily one whose corresponding first chern class in @xmath89 is @xmath90 .    as",
    "above , if @xmath68 and the @xmath2-field gerbe , restricted to @xmath47 , has trivial holonomy , than we can choose transition functions equal to @xmath22 for both the gerbes , so that becomes : @xmath91 which defines a vector bundle in the usual sense . only in this case",
    "we recover the information even about the torsion part , and we can define the wilson loop of the @xmath1-field over a closed curve as a number .",
    "we have said that , when @xmath68 and the @xmath2-field gerbe , restricted to @xmath47 , has trivial holonomy , we get a gauge theory on the world - volume in the usual sense . actually even this is not always true , unless the space - time manifold satisfies the condition @xmath92 .",
    "we show that this fact has a connection with d - brane charge classification via twisted k - theory .",
    "let us consider a space - time @xmath3 with one single d - brane with world - volume @xmath47 , supposing that @xmath68 and the @xmath2-field gerbe is trivial on the whole @xmath3 . then the gauge theory on @xmath47 should be defined on an ordinary line bundle .",
    "nevertheless , let us suppose that this line bundle is flat .",
    "then , the wilson loop of the @xmath1-field is quantized , which means that it depends only on the homology class of the loop .",
    "therefore , it defines an element of the cohomology group @xmath93 .",
    "the loops we consider in order to compute the holonomy are the images of the boundary of the world - sheet @xmath42 under the trajectories @xmath94 , which satisfy @xmath51 .",
    "this means that the loop @xmath95 , even if it is not homologically trivial on @xmath47 in general , it is trivial on @xmath3 , since @xmath42 itself trivializes it .",
    "therefore , if the flat line bundle on @xmath47 is the restriction of a flat line bundle on @xmath3 , then the holonomy over any such loop will be trivial , because it coincides with the holonomy computed on @xmath3 .",
    "since the holonomy completely determines the connection , therefore the gauge theory , this means that _ the restriction on the world - volume of a flat line bundle on the whole space - time is a pure gauge_. if we have different world - volumes on @xmath3 , each of them hosting only one d - brane , this residual gauge freedom concerns the restriction of the _ same _ flat space - time line bundle to all of the world - volumes , since the strings starting from one d - brane and ending to another provide a way to measure the difference between the holonomies on the two world - volumes , therefore , if we fix this pure gauge for one of them , it is automatically fixed for all the others .",
    "let us consider a space - time @xmath3 with one single _",
    "stack _ of d - branes with world - volume @xmath47 , still supposing that @xmath68 and the @xmath2-field gerbe is trivial on the whole @xmath3 . then the gauge theory on @xmath47 should be defined on an ordinary vector bundle .",
    "thinking as above , we should argue that the restriction to @xmath47 of a flat vector bundle on @xmath3 is a pure gauge .",
    "actually this is not the case , since it must be a _ line _ bundle anyway .",
    "in fact , if we consider @xmath28 different single d - branes very near to each other , by what we said above the residual gauge freedom is given only by a single space - time flat bundle , not one for each d - brane .",
    "when the d - branes get closer and closer until they coincide , we have a symmetry enhancement producing a stack of d - branes , but , up to fixing a base , we can still think of strings starting from one d - brane of the stack and ending to another , unless this choice depends on the base .",
    "thus , we still have the possibility of fixing the gauge up to the restriction to @xmath47 of a space - time line bundle .",
    "mathematically , this is due to the following fact .",
    "let us choose a stack of 2 d - branes , and a rank-2 complex vector bundle on @xmath3 which splits in the direct sum of two line bundles , with a flat connection @xmath96 . since @xmath97 in general for @xmath98",
    ", we also have in general that @xmath99 : therefore , even if @xmath100 and @xmath101 are cohomologous in @xmath3 , and we choose the gauge so that @xmath102 , it does not mean that the product of the traces is @xmath28 as for the trivial connection .",
    "in fact , in the present example the measure is : @xmath103 which , expanding the product , provides four terms that , when @xmath47 and @xmath104 were different , were the four possibilities for the strings .",
    "in this case , being @xmath100 and @xmath101 cohomologous , the result is : @xmath105 so that , if we fix @xmath1 , we can find @xmath106 .    in general , if we have more than one stack of d - branes in @xmath3 , the residual gauge freedom is given by a _ unique flat _ space - time _ line _ bundle , restricted to each world - volume .      from the discussion above",
    ", it follows that , when the @xmath2-field is trivial , the residual gauge freedom is measured by the space - time cohomology class @xmath107 .",
    "actually @xmath108 : in fact , a flat line bundle on @xmath3 is given by a representation of @xmath109 on @xmath7 , i.e.  by a group homomorphism @xmath110 .",
    "since @xmath7 is abelian , @xmath111 uniquely projects to a representation of the abelianization of @xmath109 , which is @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the group of flat line bundles on @xmath3 , i.e.  @xmath107 , is canonically isomorphic to @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , @xmath114 if and only if @xmath92 , hence the residual gauge freedom is not present when the space - time manifold has vanishing first homology group .",
    "let us consider the case of a stack of @xmath28 d - branes , for @xmath115 , such that the @xmath2-field is flat on the world - volume .",
    "we consider the twisted k - theory classification of d - brane charges , which has a meaning for @xmath54 $ ] torsion of the whole @xmath3 and @xmath116 as a form @xcite .",
    "the gauge bundle satisfies @xmath76 , where @xmath74 takes values in @xmath32 , while @xmath117 takes values in @xmath7 and is locally constant .",
    "in particular , the bundle defines a twisted k - theory class on @xmath47 , whose twisting class is @xmath83 = [ \\{h_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\ } ] \\in \\check{h}^{2}(y , \\underline{u}(1 ) ) \\simeq h^{3}(y , z)$ ] , which is a torsion class being @xmath117 locally constant . since , by equation , @xmath83 = w_{3}(y ) - [ h]\\vert_{y}$ ] , for @xmath118 the embedding of the world - volume in the space - time , being @xmath54 $ ] is torsion on the whole @xmath3 , there is a well - defined gysin map @xmath119}(y ) \\rightarrow k_{[h]}(x)$ ] @xcite , and",
    "the image of the k - theory class @xmath120 $ ] under this map is the d - brane charge in twisted k - theory .",
    "the point is that @xmath121}(x)$ ] is defined only up to _ non - canonical _ isomorphism .",
    "in fact , let us choose two representing cocycles of @xmath54 $ ] , the latter though of as an element of @xmath122 , which we call @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "then we can define the twisted k - theory groups @xmath125 and @xmath126 , generated by twisted bundles with twisting cocycle @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively : it is easy to see that any cochain @xmath129 such that @xmath130 realizes an isomorphism between the two groups , but two different cochains will provide different isomorphisms . instead ,",
    "since @xmath54 $ ] is torsion and @xmath116 as a form , let us consider the twisted k - theory group @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the flat holonomy of the @xmath2-field : it is defined by _ non - integral bundles _",
    ", not generically twisted bundles , such that the locally constant twisting cocycle represents the class @xmath133 .",
    "one can construct a well - defined gysin map @xmath119}(y ) \\rightarrow k_{{\\textnormal{hol}}(b)}(x)$ ] , where this time @xmath83 $ ] is the twisting class @xmath77 $ ] of the gauge bundle in the constant sheaf @xmath7 on @xmath47 .",
    "of course , two different holonomies with the same first chern class will produce non - canonically isomorphic groups , but we do not need to consider this .",
    "is the group @xmath131 well - defined ?",
    "actually it is the case if and only if @xmath114 , i.e.  if and only if the residual gauge freedom vanishes .",
    "in fact , for two locally constant cocycles @xmath129 and @xmath134 representing @xmath133 , an isomorphism between @xmath125 and @xmath126 is provided by a cochain @xmath135 such that @xmath136 : such a cochain is defined up to a cocycle , but , if @xmath114 , every cocycle is a coboundary , and a coboundary does not affect the isomorphism , since it changes the gauge choice for the transition functions but not the bundle , as it is easy to see .",
    "therefore the isomorphism is canonical .",
    "this shows that the condition @xmath114 allows for a well - defined k - theory classification group , both for the ordinary case ( in which otherwise we have to quotient out by the residual gauge freedom ) and the twisted case .",
    "we have seen that the gauge theory on a freed - witten anomaly free world - volume @xmath47 is not always a gauge theory in the canonical sense , since this can happen only when @xmath68 and the @xmath2-field gerbe , restricted to @xmath47 , has trivial holonomy . when the @xmath2-field is flat on @xmath47 , the gauge theory is defined on a non - integral vector bundle , which has well - defined chern classes , but not belonging in general to the integral lattice in the de - rham cohomology .",
    "moreover , we miss the information about the torsion part , corresponding for example to the aharonov - bohm effect in electromagnetism . for a generic non - flat @xmath2-field",
    ", there are the large gauge transformations which forbid to have any canonically defined gauge theory . moreover , when the first integral homology class of the space - time is non - vanishing",
    ", there is a residual gauge freedom represented by flat line bundles on the space - time , and the condition for this residual freedom to disappear is analogous , for flat @xmath2-field , to the one allowing to canonically define the d - brane charges via twisted k - theory , using non - integral bundles instead of generic twisted bundles .",
