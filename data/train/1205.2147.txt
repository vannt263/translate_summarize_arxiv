    "the discovery of the psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system was first reported in 1992 ( johnston et al . 1992 ) , and it is a binary system containing a rapidly rotating pulsar , psr b1259 - 63 , in orbit around a massive be star companion ls 2883 . the spin period of the pulsar is @xmath1 = 47.76 ms and the spin - down luminosity is @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the distance between the system and the earth has been updated to be @xmath5 kpc by negueruela et al .",
    "( 2011 ) recently .",
    "the emission from this system has been widely detected in radio ( johnston et al . 2005 ) , x - rays ( chernyakova et al .",
    "2006 , 2009 ; uchiyama et al . 2009 ) and tev gamma - rays ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 ) , and the light curves are modulated on the orbital period .",
    "especially , the x - ray and tev light curves are similar and display two - peak profiles .",
    "recently , this system was first detected in the gev range by the @xmath0 satellite in its last periastron passage in 2010 mid - december ( abdo et al .",
    "2011 ; tam et al .",
    "an interesting gev flare was observed with a cut - off energy at several hundred mev , which is difficult to explain with the traditional lepton model .    in the traditional lepton model of gamma - ray binaries hosting a pulsar , the interaction between the pulsar wind and the stellar outflow will terminate the winds with a shock roughly at the position where the dynamical pressures of the pulsar wind and the stellar wind are in balance , and this shock can accelerate electrons to relativistic energies .",
    "these accelerated electrons around the shock apex will emit broadband nonthermal emission via a synchrotron process for the x - rays or an external inverse compton ( eic ) scattering of the thermal photons from the be star for the tev gamma - rays ( tavani & arons 1997 ; dubus 2006 ; khangulyan et al .",
    "2007 ; takata & taam 2009 ; kong et al .",
    "the x - ray light curve reaches a maximum in flux at periastron in the simplest models , which is inconsistent with observations .",
    "some authors used some revised leptonic models to explain the drop of photon flux towards periastron , for example by introducing some non - radiative losses of electrons ( kangulyan et al . 2007 ) or varying the microphysical parameters ( takata & taam 2009 ; kong et al .",
    "2011 ) . on the other hand , the synchrotron spectrum has a maximum energy no more than @xmath6 ev by equating the synchrotron cooling timescale with the particle acceleration timescale",
    "( see sect .",
    "2.4 ) , which seems consistent with the @xmath0 observed gev cut - off energy during the flare .",
    "but we should notice that if the acceleration efficiency is constant , the maximum energy from synchrotron radiation will not vary along with the orbital phase .",
    "if this energy corresponds to the cut - off energy in the flaring period , the spectra in other periods can not be explained properly .",
    "the eic process mainly contributes to the photons at above 1 gev , and also can not explain the observed flare .",
    "some previous studies suggested that the gev flare could be produced by doppler - boosting the synchrotron radiation ( kong et al .",
    "2011 ; tam et al .",
    "the interaction between winds in a binary system should produce a bow - like structure .",
    "bogovalov et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2012 ) presented their hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between the relativistic and nonrelativistic winds in the psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system , using both the unmagnetized and magnetized , both the isotropic and anisotropic pulsar winds .",
    "they found that the bulk motion of the downstream pulsar wind electrons can be accelerated from a lorentz factor @xmath7 around the shock apex to a very large lorentz factor in the bow shock tail . some previous works ( khangulyan et al .",
    "2008 ; dubus , cerutti & henri 2010 ) have used the relativistic doppler - boosting effect to explain the emission in gamma - ray binaries . a similar effect",
    "should exist in the psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system . with a large bulk lorentz factor , the emission from the shock tail should be strongly beamed .",
    "when the line - of - sight is near the beaming direction , we can receive the boosted gev flux , otherwise , the gev photons disappear . coincidentally",
    ", the true anomaly of the gev flare ( @xmath8 ) is almost the same as the true anomaly corresponding to the direction of the earth ( @xmath9 ) , where the effect of doppler - boosting is the most significant .",
    "tam et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that the flux of the @xmath0 observations in the flaring period is enhanced by a factor of 5 - 10 , which suggests a doppler factor of around 1.5 - 2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the x - ray and tev bands , the second peaks in the light curves are also around the gev flaring period . therefore these second peaks may be produced by the emission from the shock apex and the doppler - boosted emission from the shock tail together .",
    "the two - peak profiles in both the x - ray and tev light curves are also distinctive features of the psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system .",
    "in addition to the extra - contribution from the doppler - boosting effect , some other anisotropic structures in this system may play significant roles on this problem .",
    "bogovalov & khangoulian ( 2002 ) has suggested an anisotropic distribution of energy flux in the pulsar wind to interpret the torus and jet - like structures in the center of the crab nebula .",
    "we can imagine that the anisotropy of wind is a common phenomenon in pulsars , including psr b1259 - 63 .",
    "if the spin axis of the pulsar is not perpendicular to the orbital plane , as the pulsar moving around its companion star , the energy flux injecting to the termination shock will be modulated with respect to the orbital phase .",
    "this modulation has a two - peak profile and further produces asymmetric two - peak profiles in the observed light curves .    in this paper",
    ", we will use the doppler - boosting effect to reproduce the flare in gev light curve in detail .",
    "we will also use an anisotropic pulsar wind model , together with the doppler - boosting effect , to explain the asymmetric two - peak profiles in both the x - ray and tev light curves .",
    "a variation of the magnetization parameter @xmath10 with the distance to the pulsar suggested in our previous paper ( kong et al .",
    "2011 ) is included in our calculations .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce our model in detail .",
    "we then present our results and the comparison with observations in section 3 .",
    "our discussion and conclusion are presented in section 4 .",
    "in our model , the broadband emission of the psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system is mainly from the shock - accelerated electrons , both around the shock apex and in the shock tail . due to the interaction between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind",
    ", strong shocks will be formed , and the electrons ( and positrons ) can be accelerated at the shock front of the pulsar wind .",
    "this shock will also compress the magnetic field in the pulsar wind .",
    "the shocked relativistic electrons move in the magnetic field and the photon field of the be star , and emit synchrotron and ic radiation to produce the multiband emission .      as illustrated in fig.1",
    ", the interaction between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind will form a shock with a hollow cone - like structure . the distance from the shock contact discontinuity in the shock apex to the pulsar",
    "can be determined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the separation between the pulsar and its companion and @xmath13 is the ratio of the momentum fluxes from the pulsar and the massive star . when the pulsar wind is isotropic , the value of @xmath13 should be @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the speed of light , @xmath16 is the mass - loss rate of the massive star and @xmath17 is the velocity of the stellar wind .",
    "the detail of the wind is presented in kong et al .",
    "away from the apex , the shock surface becomes a hollow cone .",
    "the half - opening angle of the shock contact discontinuity should be ( eichler & usov 1993 ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 . in this work , because we use an anisotropic pulsar wind model ( see sec .",
    "2.2 ) , the value of @xmath13 in the shock apex should vary in different orbital phases .",
    "however , as shown by bogovalov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the effect of the anisotropic pulsar wind on the bow - shock structure is relatively moderate , i.e it can not obviously affect the geometry of the bow shock , so we use the mean value of @xmath20 to determine the location of the shock apex and the shape of the bow shock in our calculations .",
    "the anisotropy in the pulsar wind mainly affects the energy flux injection to the termination shock , i.e. affects the bulk lorentz factor of the unshocked pulsar wind ( see eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) and the downstream magnetic field ( see eq . ( 7 ) ) , in different orbital phases .    in our model",
    ", we approximate that the observed emission is mainly produced in two regions ( as illustrated in fig.1 ) : ( 1 ) region i around the shock apex . the bulk motion of the particle flow in this region is assumed non - relativistic , so the radiation is isotropic .",
    "( 2 ) region ii in the shock tail . as the particle flow propagating away from the shock apex , the bulk lorentz factor of the flow will be increased gradually from @xmath21 in this region ( bogovalov et al .",
    "2008 , 2012 ) .",
    "the bulk motion is mildly - relativistic and the emission should be beamed .",
    "when the line - of - sight is near the beaming direction , as illustrated in fig . 1 , we can receive the doppler - boosted photons .",
    "note that eq.(2 ) introduced by eichler & usov ( 1993 ) is defined at a distance very far from the shock apex , where the moving directions of the unshocked pulsar and stellar winds are nearly parallel . as shown in fig . 1",
    ", because the moving directions of the unshocked pulsar and stellar winds are not the same in region ii , the mean half - opening angle of the particle flow @xmath22 should be larger than the angle @xmath23 estimated in eq.(2 ) and the angle between the direction of the stellar photons and the beaming direction should be @xmath24 . in this case , even if the line - of - sight is in the beaming direction , the directions of photons before and after scattering are not the same , and the eic process will not be completely suppressed . when the particle flow is very far from the shock apex and the massive star , it will deviate from the flow direction of region ii due to the effects of the orbital motion and the coriolis forces ( bosch - ramon & barkov 2011 ) .",
    "so in our work , we assume that the electrons beyond region ii do not contribute to the observed flux",
    ". the bulk lorentz factor of the flow at the end of region ii is @xmath25 .",
    "we also assume that the electron numbers with different bulk lorentz factors ( from @xmath21 to @xmath25 ) are the same in calculating the synchrotron and eic radiations .      as suggested by bogovalov & khangoulian ( 2002 )",
    ", the distribution of energy flux in the pulsar wind should be anisotropic and the particle flux can be considered to be more or less isotropic . defining the angle between the pulsar spin axis and the direction from the pulsar to the massive star as @xmath26 , the expression of the bulk lorentz factor of the pulsar wind in the upstream of the termination shock as a function of @xmath26 should be as following : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29",
    ". then the isotropic particle flux could be described by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the rest mass of the electron . as the pulsar orbiting around the massive star ,",
    "@xmath26 will be modulated on the orbital phase ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and the characteristics of the pulsar wind in the termination shock will vary accordingly .    as shown in khangulyan et al .",
    "( 2011a , 2011b ) , the eic cooling will reduce the lorentz factor of the unshocked electrons .",
    "we will not consider this effect in our modelling , and the initial bulk lorentz factor parameter of the unshocked pulsar wind @xmath32 should be higher if this effect is added .",
    "note that because the pulsar wind bow shock is extended , we only obtain an upper limit of the wind anisotropy effect .",
    "but the two emission regions in our model are only a part of the whole bow shock , the effect of the extending bow shock is relatively moderate . on the other hand , we can vary the parameter @xmath26 to increase the effect of the anisotropic pulsar wind .",
    "the magnetization parameter @xmath10 is defined as the ratio of the magnetic energy density and the particle kinetic energy density in the pulsar wind . as estimated in kong et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , by using the pulsar parameters of psr 1259 - 63 , the magnetization parameter at the light cylinder should be @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the magnetic field at the light cylinder , @xmath35 is the radius of the light cylinder , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the @xmath38 multiplicity and @xmath39 is the goldreich - julian particle flow at the light cylinder . in outer gap models ( e.g. cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , 1986b ; zhang & cheng 1997 ; takata , wang & cheng 2010 ) , the multiplicity due to various pair - creation processes could reach @xmath40 .",
    "( 5 ) shows that the pulsar wind is poynting - dominated at the light cylinder . in some studies of the crab nebula ( kennel & coroniti 1984a , 1984b ) ,",
    "the pulsar wind should be kinetic - dominated ( @xmath41 ) at a distance of @xmath42 cm from the pulsar .",
    "we can imagine that between the light cylinder and the termination shock , the magnetic energy will be gradually converted into the particle kinetic energy . in our previous work ( kong et al .",
    "2011 ) , we have already shown that a variation of magnetization parameter @xmath10 with the distance from the pulsar could help us to reproduce the two - peak profiles in light curves , and we will use the same variation in this work and describe it as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the distance from the pulsar , and the typical value of the index @xmath45 is of the order of unity .",
    "the downstream magnetic field in region i could be described as ( kennel & coroniti 1984a , 1984b ) @xmath46 @xmath47^\\frac{1}{2}}{16(\\sigma+1)}.\\ ] ] because region ii is far from the shock apex and it is an oblique shock there , the magnetic field should be lower than that in region i. we assume the ratio between the magnetic fields in the two emission regions does not change in different orbital phases , and the exact ratio is determined by fitting in our work .",
    "it is usually assumed that the unshocked cold electron pairs in the pulsar wind can be accelerated to a power - law distribution @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) in the termination shock front and be injected into the downstream post - shock flow , where @xmath50 is the electron distribution index .",
    "the minimum lorentz factor can be determined from the conservations of the total electron number @xmath51 and the total electron energy @xmath52 , and we can acquire @xmath53 for @xmath54 ( kirk , ball & skjraasen 1999 ) . the maximum lorentz factor @xmath55 can be determined by equating the cooling timescale of electrons with the particle acceleration timescale as the following form , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the electron charge , @xmath58 is the thompson scattering cross section , @xmath59 is the acceleration efficiency which is usually less than unity .",
    "hereafter the convention @xmath60 is adopted for the cgs units .",
    "the electrons will lose their energies through the radiative or adiabatic cooling processes , and the evolved electron spectrum @xmath61 can be obtained from the continuity equation of the electron distribution ( ginzburg & syrovatshii 1964 ) , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total energy loss rate of the electrons and @xmath64 is the injection rate .",
    "the coefficient of the injection rate in region i @xmath65 ( @xmath49 ) can be calculated from @xmath66 , where @xmath67 $ ] by assuming the typical scale of the shock apex is @xmath68 ( dubus 2006 ) .",

    "about half of the pulsar wind electrons are injected to the emission regions .",

    "our calculated broadband light curves of the psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system and the comparisons with observations are presented in fig .",
    "we can see that the asymmetric two - peak profiles in the x - ray and tev light curves can be well reproduced by our model .",

    "the shock apex region also contributes to some emission in the post - periastron range , and the whole light curves display the asymmetric two - peak profiles with the flux before periastron higher than that after periastron .",
    "the anisotropic pulsar wind plays a significant role in producing this asymmetric two - peak profile because of its anisotropic energy flux injection to the termination shock .",
    "the emission from the shock tail is unimportant before periastron , because the angle between the line - of - sight and the direction of the flow in the shock tail @xmath105 is large .",
    "but it has an obvious contribution in the light curves after periastron , i.e. the second peaks in both the x - ray and tev light curves are produced by the electrons in the shock apex and the shock tail together .",
    "for the gev light curves , we can see that almost all the flux in the gev flares are produced by the emission from the shock tail , where the emission is beamed and both the photon energy and detected flux are doppler - boosted .",
    "the psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system is an attractive binary system and special for having distinct modulations in the light curves of different energy bands .",
    "the x - ray and tev light curves are similar and have two peaks before and after periastron respectively .",
    "the gev light curve has an interesting flare several weeks after the periastron passage , whose spectrum cuts off at several hundred mev . in this paper",
    ", we have modelled the x - ray , gev and tev observations of this system . in our calculations , an anisotropic pulsar wind model and the relativistic doppler - boosting effect",
    "are considered , and the x - ray and gev photons are mainly from the synchrotron radiation and the tev emission is mainly from the eic process .",
    "we also assume that the emission from both the shock apex and the shock tail can contribute to the observations , and the shock apex radiation is isotropic and the emission from the shock tail is beamed because of the flow in the tail moving mildly - relativistically .",
    "we find that for the x - rays and tev gamma - rays , the anisotropic energy flux injection of the pulsar wind plays an important role in producing the asymmetric two - peak profiles in the light curves .",
    "the observations before the periastron are mainly produced by the shocked electrons around the shock apex and the photons after periastron are contributed by the emission from the shock apex and the shock tail together . for the gev gamma - rays , the observed flare is contributed by the emission from the shock tail , where the synchrotron photons are doppler - boosted strongly .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know the exact structure and physical processes in the shock tail , so in our calculations we make some assumptions , and we just show that our model is a possible way to reproduce the multiwavelength features in the psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system .",
    "a more exact modelling could be done by using the detailed simulation results on binary pulsar systems ( bogovalov et al .",
    "2008 , 2012 ; takata et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in our modelling",
    ", we use an assumption that the magnetization parameter @xmath10 varies with the distance to the pulsar , which is in principle possible .",
    "some recent studies found that the variation of magnetization parameter @xmath10 could be in a different way .",
    "for example , aharonian , bogovalov & khangulyan ( 2012 ) showed that the magnetization parameter @xmath10 should decrease abruptly within @xmath164 cm from the pulsar by fitting the observations of the crab pulsar . because the exact conversion process from poynting flux to kinetic energy in the pulsar wind is still unclear ,",
    "we think both models can not be excluded .",
    "some previous models implied that the energy conversion could exist over the entire distance from the pulsar to the termination shock ( coroniti 1990 ; lyubarsky & kirk 2001 ) , and contopoulos & kazanas ( 2002 ) further showed that @xmath10 could decrease inversely proportional to the distance from the light cylinder . in our previous paper ( kong et al .",
    "2011 ) , a variation of the magnetization parameter @xmath10 with the distance from the pulsar could help us to reproduce the two - peak profiles in light curves , and we also need a variation index @xmath142 to fit the observations better in this work .",
    "the adoption of @xmath165 here is purely phenomenological , which is affected by both the unclear magnetic energy dissipation and the eic cooling of the unshocked pulsar wind ( khangulyan et al .",
    "2011a , 2011b ) .    in our previous paper ( kong et al .",
    "2011 ) , we discussed the effect of the disk in the stellar wind on the x - ray and tev light curves .",
    "the existence of a disk in the psr b1259 - 63/ls 2883 system was confirmed by the radio observations ( johnston et al .",
    "1996 , 2005 ) , but the exact position of the disk is still unclear .",
    "some radio observations suggested that the disk is tilted with respect to the orbital plane and the line of intersection between the disk plane and the orbital plane is oriented at about @xmath166 with respect to the major axis of the binary orbit ( wex et al .",
    "1998 ; wang , johnston & manchester 2004 ) .",
    "chernyakova et al .",
    "( 2006 ) further suggested that the half - opening angle of the disk ( projected on the pulsar orbital plane ) is @xmath167 , and the intersection between the stellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane is inclined at @xmath168 to the major axis of the pulsar orbit by fitting the x - ray and tev light curves .",
    "our previous calculations ( kong et al . 2011 ) showed that the x - ray flux increases in the passage of the disk , but the flux in the tev range decreases significantly , which is consistent with the analysis by kerschhaggl ( 2011 ) .",
    "but note that we only consider the emission from the shock apex in kong et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . when the pulsar entering the disk , the mass flux density will increase by a factor of 30 - 100 ( waters et al .",
    "1988 ) . by assuming the stellar wind velocity reduced by a factor of 10 , the momentum flux density ratio @xmath13 will decrease by a factor of 3 - 10 in the disk . in this case",
    ", the half - opening angle of the emission region in the shock tail will decrease and the angle between the line - of - sight and the direction of the flow in the shock tail @xmath105 will increase .",
    "the effect of doppler - boosting will be suppressed and the emission from shock tail will be reduced .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "5 that there are only upper limits in gev light curves between true anomaly @xmath166 and @xmath169 . the non - detection in this period may be due to the suppression of the shock tail emission in the disk .",
    "the tev observations also show a reduction in flux during the estimated disk passage , which are consistent with the explanation that emission from both the shock apex ( kong et al .",
    "2011 ) and the shock tail will decrease in the disk . in x - ray band , there are significant signals between true anomaly @xmath166 and @xmath169 .",
    "but note that the x - ray flux from the shock apex could increase in the passage of the disk ( kong et al .",
    "the increase of the shock apex emission and the decrease of the shock tail emission in the disk will compete with each other , and the total flux could have no significant change .    in a recent paper , khangulyan et al .",
    "( 2011a ) investigated the emission spectrum produced by the eic process of the unshocked pulsar wind .",
    "they argued that the gamma - ray flare in gev band after the periastron can be explained by the eic emission of the cold pulsar wind with the bulk lorentz factor @xmath170 . the be star disk plays a significant role in producing gev flare in their model .",
    "first , the radiation of the shocked stellar disk can provide a dense photon target for the eic scattering ( van soelen & meintjes 2011 ) .",
    "second , the strong ram pressure inside the disk makes the wind termination shock stand close to the pulsar , and then the eic luminosity should be suppressed .",
    "when the pulsar escapes the disk , the unshocked pulsar wind zone towards the observer is significantly increased .",
    "consequently , an enhancement of the gamma - rays will be observed .",
    "although in our model the gev flare is produced by the doppler - boosted synchrotron radiation , the eic process of the unshocked pulsar wind may also have some contributions .",
    "note that in the pre - periastron spectrum data in tam et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the @xmath0 detected emission is concentrated in a narrow band between 1 - 25 gev . the observed spectrum is different from the spectrum produced by synchrotron radiation , and is similar to the calculated spectra in khangulyan et al .",
    "( 2011a ) .",
    "if the data in this range is indeed correct , we argue that this part of gev photons may be produced by the eic process of the unshocked electrons before termination shock in the pulsar wind .",
    "if the 3d structure of the shock is a simple hollow cone at the shock tail , we expect that two flares per orbital period will be observed when the angle between the line - of - sight and the orbital plane is smaller than the half - opening angle of the shock cone , and each flare can last for about @xmath171 orbital phase @xmath172 , where @xmath89 is the bulk lorentz factor at the tail of the shock .",
    "otherwise , when the line - of - sight is near the edge of the hollow cone or outside the hollow cone , as illustrated in fig . 1",
    ", only one flare could be observed in the light curve . as the angle between the line - of - sight and the flow direction increasing",
    ", the flare will be smoother and disappear eventually . in principle , our model could be used in other similar gamma - ray binary systems in our galaxy with different observational angles and distinct light curves .",
