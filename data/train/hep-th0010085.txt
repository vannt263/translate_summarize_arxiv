    "recent studies , including strong coupling corrections to the string effective action , have provided the pre - big bang scenario @xcite with a number of promising models for the transition from the growing to the decreasing curvature regime @xcite . however , a crucial question remains : is it possible to test this scenario and , in particular , to distinguish it from other candidate models which attempt to describe the very early universe ?",
    "the answer to this essential question is in principle in the affirmative , since the pre - big bang scenario incorporates a dilaton field coupled to the metric , which modifies the evolution of tensor perturbations .",
    "it is well known , indeed , that the transition from an inflationary period to the frw radiation - dominated era is associated with the production of a background of relic gravitational waves .",
    "such primordial signals decoupled from matter soon after the planck era and , unlike electromagnetic radiation which underwent a complicated history until recombination , gravitons have been transmitted scarcely without interaction down to our present epoch . as a consequence , their present spectrum should be a faithful portrait of the very early universe , thus opening a window for the observation of processes occurring near the planck scale , and for discriminating among various theories of high - energy models of cosmology and of unified interactions .",
    "with respect to the standard inflationary scenario , the amplification of tensor perturbations in the pre - big bang scenario is strongly enhanced in the limit of large frequencies @xcite , and the amplitude of the spectrum is normalised so as to match the string scale at the high - frequency end point of the spectrum @xcite . as a result , it has been claimed @xcite that the produced background of gravitational waves could be detected in the near future by various experiments such as the second ( planned ) generation of interferometric detectors @xcite .    up to now , the above extended studies of tensor perturbations have been mostly performed in the context of the lowest - order effective action of string theory .",
    "however , the singular behaviour of the tree - level background cosmological solutions implies that such studies are a priori inadequate to describe the high - frequency branch of the spectrum .",
    "indeed short - scale modes are expected to leave the hubble radius during the high - curvature regime which has to remain bounded from above .",
    "this is a major problem for the prediction of the amplification of these high - frequency modes , the ones to be mostly detected ( if at all ) .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to discuss the evolution and the spectral distribution of primordial gravitons in the context of non - singular cosmological backgrounds , by taking into account ( in the perturbation equation ) the full contribution of those corrections that are responsible for the regularisation of the background solution .",
    "in the pre - big bang framework , our frw - universe is presently understood to result from the collision of plane waves @xcite emerging from the trivial string vacuum in the asymptotic past @xcite . from this epoch",
    "onwards , the evolution of the universe , driven by the kinetic energy of the dilaton , undergoes an inflationary expansion with growing coupling and curvature .",
    "such an evolution is usually derived by the @xmath0-dimensional low energy effective action of string theory : @xmath1 + { \\cal l}_{c } \\bigr\\}.\\ ] ] when the curvature reaches a maximal scale @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , the universe is expected to be smoothly connected to the frw regime , with a constant dilaton field .",
    "the most promising approach to the graceful exit problem @xcite suggests a cure to the curvature and dilaton singularities by adding higher - order corrections to the string effective action ( see for instance @xcite ) , whose sources are twofold : tree - level @xmath4 corrections , resulting from the string tension expansion of the effective action and loop corrections , arising from the more conventional loop expansion in powers of the string coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the tree - level @xmath4 correction we will be considering ( see @xcite for a detailed analysis ) includes the most general form for a correction to the string action up to fourth - order in derivatives @xcite :",
    "@xmath6 \\phi_{,\\mu } \\phi_{,\\nu }        + c_3 \\box \\phi\\ , \\phi^{,\\mu } \\phi_{,\\mu }    - c_4 ( \\phi^{,\\mu } \\phi_{,\\mu})^2 \\big\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the well - know gauss - bonnet combination ensuring the field equations will remain second order in the fields . in fixing the coefficients @xmath8 s",
    ", we require that the full action reproduces the string scattering amplitude , and thus impose the constraints @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 , working in units @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 allows us to move between different string theories and later we will set @xmath13 to agree with previous studies of the heterotic string @xcite .",
    "another conventional expansion of string theory relies on the string coupling parameter @xmath14 .",
    "there is as yet no definitive calculation of the full loop expansion of string theory , and we are left to speculate on plausible terms that will eventually make up the loop corrections .",
    "multiplying each term of the tree - level @xmath4 correction by a suitable power of the string coupling is the approach we will be considering here and has already met with some success @xcite . since the quantum loop corrections are not formally derived from a string loop expansion , we shall allow different coefficients @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) at one - loop in the string coupling ( two - loop respectively ) , which are not necessarily subject to the previous constraints .",
    "the effective lagrangian density @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ low ] ) is thus a sum of the tree - level @xmath4 and loop corrections , @xmath18 and in the present case takes the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is given by eq .",
    "( [ class ] ) , with the extra constant parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 actually controlling the onset of the loop corrections .",
    "numerous combinations of these corrections regularise the evolution of the background , an example of which is pictured in fig .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are typically of order unity and have opposivite signs @xcite .",
    "thus , we can use these non - singular solutions to extend different studies based on the tree - level action and probe the high - frequency part of the spectrum of relic gravitons .",
    "we shall now focus on the generation of gravitational waves arising from linearised tensor perturbations .",
    "although several mechanisms may contribute to the generation of gravitational waves from the initial vacuum state of string cosmology ( dynamic dimensional reduction @xcite , time - dependence of the dilaton field @xcite ) , we shall only consider here the usual contribution arising from the accelerated expansion of the external three - dimensional space .",
    "as already stressed in a number of papers @xcite , the production of high - frequency gravitons is strongly enhanced compared to that of the standard inflationary scenario . following pionnering work in @xcite , we perturb the full action generated by eq .",

    ", we can rewrite the linearised wave equation in terms of the eigenstates of the laplace operator , @xmath27 . in so doing ,",

    "( [ two ] ) ) of those corrections we used to regularise the background evolution .",
    "we stress that in the limit of small coupling and low curvature @xmath32 we recover the usual schdinger - like wave equation since @xmath33 and thus @xmath34 . indeed , describing an extremely weak coupling and low curvature regime , the tree - level solutions of the pre - big bang scenario are fully adequate in the asymptotic past to describe the gravi - dilaton background the metric perturbations are emerging from .",
