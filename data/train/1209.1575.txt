    "the last similarity studied in section [ sec2.3 ] is that for arbitrary initial curves which are analytic there is an unique local solution , which is analytic , both forward and backward in time .",
    "we remark that for this result the rayleigh - taylor condition is not needed .",
    "the proofs follows the steps of the paper @xcite .",
    "here we show that the contribution from the boundary does not affect the _ a priori _ estimates from @xcite . in section [ sec2.4 ]",
    "we show an ill - posedness result in sobolev spaces .",
    "the key point of this result is that we do not need global existence for some class of solutions to prove the result ( compare with @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to study the differences between the case with infinite depth and the case with bounded medium .",

    "let us observe that the natural boundary condition for the velocity , @xmath65 , imposes that if our initial interface is close enough to the boundary the evolution of the maximum is very slow .",

    "the region a is the region where we have maximum principle for the derivative . due to the term coming from the effect of the boundaries , @xmath47 , the conditions that we obtain are much more restrictives than in the deep water regime ( the case with infinite depth ) .",
    "the previous result gives us conditions on the smallness of @xmath80 and @xmath67 ( which , for fixed amplitude , can be understood as the _ wavelength _ of the wave ) so , roughly speaking the theorem says that if we are in the long wave regime ( small amplitude and large wavelenght ) then there is no _ turning effect _ , _",
    "i.e. _ there are no shocks .",
    "we remark that if we take the limit @xmath57 we recover the result for the deep water regime contained in @xcite    we study the formation of singularities in section [ sec3.2 ] .",

    "physically this result means that there are waves such that they _",
    "turn over_. moreover , we compare this result with the result for the deep water regime ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we obtain firm numerical evidence of the following turning effect in a confined medium : there exist initial data @xmath82 such that in finite time the solution of achieves the unstable regime only when the depth is finite . if the depth is infinite the same curves become graphs ( see section [ sec3.3 ] ) .    in order to simplify the notation we take @xmath83 and",

    "+ 3 .   for @xmath454",
    "we get @xmath455 .",
    "thus , for @xmath454 , the curve is no longer a graph and the rayleigh - taylor condition is not satisfied in a neighbourhood of @xmath456 .          in this section",
    "we obtain firm numerical evidence showing that the confined problem is more singular than the problem with infinite depth .",
    "the precise statement of this fact is the following : _ we consider a strip with width equal to @xmath136 , a fixed constant . then there exists initial data @xmath458 that can not be parametrized as graphs such that the solution of @xmath459 achieve the ( rayleigh - taylor ) unstable case and , if you consider the same initial datum when the depth is infinite , the same curves becomes graphs . _",
    "indeed , if @xmath464 then denoting @xmath465 , we have @xmath466 and @xmath467 for @xmath121 small enough .",
    "this implies @xmath468 for a small enough @xmath283 and the curve can be parametrized as a graph . if @xmath469 , then @xmath470 if @xmath84 is small enough and the curve can not be parametrized as a graph .",
    "we construct a piecewise smooth curve such that both conditions holds ( see figure [ curvassing ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath471 defined as follows @xmath472 with @xmath473 .",
    "the idea is to take @xmath474 such that @xmath475 for @xmath476 .",
    "moreover , we take @xmath441 as in with @xmath477 , i.e. , @xmath478 notice that , in the deep water regime , the expression takes the form @xmath479 substituting the choice of @xmath233 , we need to compute @xmath480 where @xmath481 @xmath482 and @xmath483 in the finite depth case the integrals appearing in are @xmath484 where @xmath485        in order to obtain the sign of and , we compute the integrals @xmath488 using the trapezoidal rule with a fine enough mesh ( see figure [ sing1 ] ) .",
    "the integrals @xmath489 are approximated by @xmath490 and @xmath491 the truncation of the integral domains in @xmath492 gives us an error @xmath493 . to obtain this",
    "bound we notice that , due to the particular choice of @xmath431 , @xmath494 and the same is valid for the relevant integral in the presence of boundaries .",
    "the other error is coming from the method used in the numerical quadrature .",
    "we use the trapezoidal rule , obtaining @xmath495 .",
    "we conclude that , if @xmath496 denotes the numerical approximation of @xmath497 defined in , we have @xmath498 and , analogously , in the case where @xmath497 is defined in we get @xmath499      in order to complete a rigorous enclosure of the integral , we are left with the bounding of the errors coming from the floating point representation and the computer operations and their propagation . in a forthcoming paper ( see @xcite ) we will deal with this matter . by using interval arithmetics , we will give a computer assisted proof of this result .",
