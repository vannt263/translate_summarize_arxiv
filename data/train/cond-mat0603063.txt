    "this paper aims to summarize recent progress in techniques for performing _",
    "ab initio _ calculations with computational effort scaling linearly with system size .",
    "the target systems are intended to be very large ( tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of atoms ) , with the implementation using methods based on density - functional theory ( dft ) and pseudopotentials  @xcite .",
    "the conquest dft code@xcite is designed to perform this kind of calculation , and its @xmath3 capabilities have been tested on systems of up to 16,000 atoms@xcite , but up to now it has been limited to rather simple systems .",
    "we report here the developments which now make it possible to do @xmath3 dft calculations on non - trivial materials problems using the conquest code .    the car - parrinello paper of 1985  @xcite set a completely new agenda for computational condensed matter science .",
    "in that paper , the strategy based on density functional theory ( dft ) , pseudopotentials and plane waves was formulated in a new and powerful way that eventually led to its current widespread application across all the disciplines that are based on a molecular view of matter . yet soon after 1985 an important limitation of the strategy had been recognised . in several papers in the early 1990 s  @xcite ,",
    "it was pointed out that the number of computer operations demanded by the car - parrinello strategy would increase ultimately as @xmath1 with the number of atoms @xmath2 in the system . at the same time , it was realised that such a rapid increase must be avoidable , since the locality of quantum coherence  @xcite ( known as the principle of near - sightedness@xcite ) should make it possible to determine the electronic ground state of a system with a number of operations that increases only linearly with @xmath2 .",
    "ideas for reformulating the strategy to achieve @xmath3 scaling were proposed at that time  @xcite , and rapidly led to practical @xmath3 methods within tight - binding schemes .",
    "the feasibility of performing @xmath3 dft calculations on systems of many thousands of atoms was also demonstrated about 8 years ago@xcite .",
    "however , the early promise of those ideas has taken a long time to be turned into practical techniques for performing @xmath3 dft calculations on systems containing many thousands of atoms .",
    "we report here encouraging new results from the @xmath3 conquest code  @xcite on systems of nearly 23,000 atoms , which , together with other recent progress , suggest that the promise is at last being realised .",
    "we start by recalling the principles on which conquest and a number of other @xmath3 codes ( such as onetep , openmx and siesta ) are based  @xcite .",
    "the locality of quantum coherence is expressed by the decay of the kohn - sham density matrix @xmath4 as @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "one way of determining the self - consistent dft ground state is to write the total energy @xmath6 in terms of @xmath7 , and to minimise @xmath6 with respect to @xmath8 , subject to the conditions that ( i )  @xmath8 is hermitian ; ( ii )  @xmath8 is idempotent ( i.e. it is a projector ) ; and ( iii )  @xmath8 gives the correct number of electrons  @xcite . since @xmath6 is variational , @xmath3 operation is achieved by imposing the truncation @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and the true dft ground state is recovered as the cut - off distance @xmath11 is increased .    to obtain a workable scheme",
    ", it is required that @xmath8 be separable ( i.e. that the number of its non - zero eigenvalues be finite ) : @xmath12 in practical codes , the @xmath13 have been chosen to be `` localised orbitals '' centred on the atoms , with @xmath14 being the @xmath15th orbital on atom @xmath16 .",
    "( centring on atoms is not essential , and the orbitals can be allowed to float , see for example  @xcite . )",
    "the localised orbitals ( which in the conquest scheme are referred to as `` support functions '' ) must be represented in terms of basis functions .",
    "the choice of basis function is a well - known problem in electronic structure ; in this context , the two extremes are those of small basis size and simplicity ( solutions of the atomic schrdinger equation ) and large basis size and systematicity ( allowing an increase in accuracy ) . in the former group",
    "are numerical atomic orbitals@xcite while in the latter are spherical waves@xcite , periodic sinc functions@xcite , wavelets@xcite , numerical representation on a grid@xcite and blips functions@xcite .",
    "recently , there has been work showing that it is possible to define a systematically convergent set of numerical orbitals ( with respect to number of orbitals per angular momentum channel)@xcite , and that numerical orbitals can be fitted systematically to results of plane wave calculations@xcite .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath17 are then the elements of the density matrix in the ( generally non - orthogonal ) representation of the @xmath18 .",
    "to achieve @xmath3 , the @xmath13 are required to be non - zero only within finite regions , which can be chosen as spheres of radius @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is also subject to a spatial cut - off . the ground state is then found by minimising @xmath6 with respect to the orbitals @xmath13 , if the basis set allows this , and with respect to the @xmath21 , subject to idempotency and fixed electron number  @xcite .",
    "there are many ways of finding the ground state density matrix , @xmath20 , including the auxiliary density matrix method@xcite , penalty functional methods@xcite , the fermi operator expansion ( foe)@xcite , bond - order potential ( bop)@xcite , and the constrained search formalism@xcite .",
    "many of these have been compared for different materials@xcite and are described in an extensive review article@xcite .",
    "the practical implementation of any @xmath3 scheme raises two important questions initially : first , which basis set to choose for representing the localised orbitals ( the most common choices were mentioned above ) ; and second , how to find the ground state density matrix within the requirement of idempotency ( again , several of the more common schemes were mentioned above ) . at present , in conquest , two basis sets are available : the b - splines , or blips , which can be systematically converged to a given plane wave result ; and pseudo - atomic orbitals , which are economical and very often give accurate results .",
    "we envisage that we will implement other options as required .",
    "the main emphasis in the present paper is on pseudo - atomic orbitals .    as mentioned above",
    ", there are various techniques in use for finding the ground - state density matrix .",
    "the present implementation in conquest@xcite is a combination of the techniques of li , nunes and vanderbilt ( lnv)@xcite and palser and manolopoulos  @xcite , both of which are closely related to mcweeny s ` purification ' scheme  @xcite . in the lnv technique , the density matrix @xmath22 is represented in terms of an ` auxiliary ' density matrix @xmath23 as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the overlap matrix for the support functions or localised orbitals : @xmath26 .",
    "this scheme enforces ` weak ' idempotency  @xcite ( meaning that all eigenvalues are in the interval @xmath27 $ ] ) rather than strict idempotency .",
    "if the total energy is minimised with respect to @xmath23 ( writing @xmath28 $ ] for the band energy ) , this scheme automatically drives @xmath22 towards idempotency . in order to ensure @xmath3 scaling ,",
    "a spatial cut - off is imposed on the @xmath23-matrix , so that @xmath29 when the distance between the centres of the support - functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 exceeds a chosen cut - off @xmath32 .",
    "other methods for finding the ground - state density matrix could be implemented with little effort .    as well as operating in the @xmath3 mode ,",
    "conquest can find the ground state directly by diagonalisation , using the scalapack package , which allows efficient parallelisation of the diagonalisation .",
    "since it scales as @xmath33 , this will only be approrpriate for relatively small systems , but it provides an important tool both for testing the outer parts of the ground - state search ( described below ) and for exploring the convergence of the @xmath3 algorithm with the cut - off on the @xmath23-matrix .",
    "the search for the ground - state is organised into three loops . in the innermost loop ,",
    "the support functions and electron density are fixed and the ground - state density matrix is found , either by varying @xmath23 or by diagonalisation . in the middle loop , self - consistency",
    "is achieved by systematically reducing the electron - density residual , i.e. the difference between the input and output density in a given self - consistency cycle  @xcite . in the outer loop ,",
    "the energy is minimised with respect to the support functions , @xmath30 .",
    "this organisation corresponds to a hierarchy of approximations : when the inner loop alone is used , we get the scheme known as non - self - consistent _ ab initio _ tight binding ( nsc - aitb ) , which is a form of the harris - foulkes approximation  @xcite ; when the inner two loops are used , we get self - consistent _ ab initio _ tight binding ( sc - aitb ) ; finally , if all loops are used , we have full _ ab initio_. in this last case , we recover the exact dft ground state as the region radius @xmath19 and the @xmath23-matrix cut - off @xmath32 are increased . for non - metallic systems , the evidence so far is that accurate approximations to the ground state are obtained with quite modest values of the cut - offs  @xcite .    for calculations at the level of full _ ab initio _ accuracy ,",
    "the convergence of the outer loop ( optimising the support functions with respect to their basis functions ) is well - conditioned provided appropriate pre - conditioning measures are taken ; these have been discussed both for blips in the context of conquest@xcite and for psinc functions in the context of onetep@xcite .",
    "we note that conquest can be run in a mode analagous to siesta , where pseudo - atomic orbitals are used and no optimisation is performed ; in this case , the outer loop is not performed .",
    "we have recently found that the self - consistency search ( the middle loop described above ) can be accelerated by use of the kerker preconditioning .",
    "this idea , which is well - known in the plane - wave community , removes long wavelength changes in the charge density during mixing .",
    "it is applied in reciprocal space , as a prefactor : @xmath34 then the charge is mixed using a pulay or broyden ( or related ) scheme@xcite with the prefactor applied to the residual or output charge after transformation to reciprocal space .",
    "the mixing includes a parameter , a , which determines how aggressive the mixing is ( with the input charge density for iteration @xmath35 given by @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the residual from iteration @xmath38 ) .",
    "the efficacy of this preconditioning is explored , both for exact diagonalisation and linear scaling , in section  [ sec : self - consistency ] .",
    "while performing the search for self - consistency , we must monitor the residual .",
    "we define the following dimensionless parameter which is used to monitor the search : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the simulation cell volume and we use the usual definition of residual , @xmath41 , the difference between the output and input charge densities .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 is then the rms value of @xmath43 normalised by dividing by the _",
    "average _ charge density in the system , @xmath44 .",
    "note that , for systems containing large amounts of vacuum , the criterion for convergence will need to be altered when compared to bulk - like environments . this criterion may be coupled with a monitor on the largest value of residual on an individual grid point @xmath45 , @xmath46    the scheme we have outlined is closely related to the methods used in siesta  @xcite , openmx@xcite and onetep@xcite .",
    "the main differences are : ( i ) the basis sets chosen ( siesta uses fixed paos , while openmx uses optimized orbitals and onetep psinc functions ) ; ( ii ) the method of finding the ground state density matrix ( siesta uses the constrained search technique@xcite , openmx the divide - and - conquer@xcite or bop@xcite and onetep either penalty functional@xcite or lnv@xcite ) ; ( iii )  the technique of ` neutral - atom potentials '  @xcite , used by siesta and openmx , which allows calculation of matrix elements to be performed very efficiently for localised , atomic - like basis sets .",
    "the principle of near - sightedness ( i.e. spatial locality of electronic structure ) , means that sparse matrix multiplications and other operations are restricted to a finite area of space , leading to a natural route to parallel decomposition of the problem .",
    "conquest was written from the outset as parallel code , and a large part of the development effort has been concerned with techniques for achieving good parallel scaling .",
    "the parallelisation techniques have been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite , so we give only a brief summary .",
    "there are three main types of operation that must be carefully distributed across processors :    * the storage and manipulation of localised orbitals , e.g. the calculation of @xmath47 on the integration grid starting from blip- or pao - coefficients , and the calculation of the derivatives of @xmath6 with respect to these coefficients , which are needed for the ground - state search ; * the storage and manipulation of elements of the various matrices ( @xmath48 , @xmath25 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , etc ... ) ; * the calculation of matrix elements by summation over domains of points on the integration grid , or by analytic operations ( for certain integrals involving paos and blips ) .    efficient parallelisation of these operations , and the elimination of unnecessary communication between processors , depend heavily on the organisation of both atoms and grid points into small compact sets , which are assigned to processors  @xcite .",
    "when the code runs in @xmath3 mode , matrix multiplication takes a large part of the computer effort , and we have developed parallel multiplication techniques  @xcite that exploit the specific patterns of sparsity on which @xmath3 operation depends .",
    "in order to perform structural relaxation or molecular dynamics of materials with an electronic structure technique , the algorithms for calculating the forces @xmath49 on the ions must be the exact derivatives of the total ground state energy , @xmath50 , with respect to the positions , @xmath51 , such that @xmath52 .",
    "one of the advantages of dft , within the pseudopotential approximation , is that it is easy , in principle , to achieve this relationship between the forces and the energy .",
    "since the conquest formalism allows the calculation of the total energy at different levels of accuracy , some care is needed in the formulation of the forces to develop a scheme that works at all levels of this hierarchy .",
    "it is also important to ensure that it works equally well ( and accurately ) for both the diagonalisation and @xmath3 modes of operation implemented in conquest .",
    "we have recently described these algorithms in detail@xcite , but we summarise them below for convenience .",
    "we recall the harris - foulkes expression@xcite for the total energy , which is often applied when self - consistency is not sought , but which at self - consistency is identical to the standard kohn - sham expression for total energy .",
    "the expression is :    @xmath53    with @xmath54 the coulomb energy between the ionic cores , and the band - structure energy , the double - counting hartree and exchange - correlation energies defined as :    @xmath55\\\\ \\delta e_\\mathrm{har } & = & - \\frac{1}{2 } \\int d \\mathbf{r } \\ ,",
    "n^\\mathrm{in } ( \\mathbf{r } ) v_\\mathrm{har}^\\mathrm{in } ( \\mathbf{r } ) \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ \\delta e_\\mathrm{xc } & = & \\int d \\mathbf{r } \\ , n^\\mathrm{in } ( \\mathbf{r } ) \\left ( \\epsilon_\\mathrm{xc } ( n^\\mathrm{in } ( \\mathbf{r } ) ) - \\mu_\\mathrm{xc } ( n^\\mathrm{in } ( \\mathbf{r } ) ) \\right ) \\ ; . \\label{eqn : e_double_count}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath56 is the _ input _ charge density used ( normally a superposition of atomic charge densities if a non - self - consistent scheme is used , or the self - consistent charge density if self - consistency is used ) .",
    "this expression is very useful when comparing forces at different levels of approximation .    at the empirical tb level ,",
    "the ionic force is a sum of the band - structure part @xmath57 and the pair - potential part @xmath58 , the former being given by  @xcite : @xmath59 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath60 are the density matrix and energy matrix respectively  @xcite .",
    "it is readily shown that in the @xmath3 scheme of lnv , and in some other @xmath3 schemes , the same formula for @xmath57 is the exact derivative of the @xmath3 total energy . in the lnv scheme , @xmath22",
    "is given by eqn  ( [ eq : lnv_dm ] ) , and @xmath60 by : @xmath61    in nsc - aitb ( harris - foulkes ) , the forces can be written in two equivalent ways . the way that corresponds most closely to empirical tb is : @xmath62 where @xmath57 is given by exactly the same formula as in empirical tb .",
    "the contributions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which arise from the double - counting hartree and exchange - correlation parts of the nsc - aitb total energy , have been discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the final term @xmath65 come from the ion - ion coulomb energy .",
    "this way of writing @xmath66 expresses the well - known relationship between nsc - aitb and empirical tb that in the latter the pair term represents the sum of the three contributions @xmath67 .",
    "the alternative , and exactly equivalent , way of writing @xmath66 in nsc - aitb is : @xmath68 here , @xmath69 is the `` hellmann - feynman '' force exerted by the valence electrons on the ion cores ; @xmath70 is the pulay force that arises in any method where the basis set depends on ionic positions ; @xmath71 is a force contribution associated with non - self - consistency , and is expressed in terms of the difference between output and input electron densities ; @xmath65 , as before , is the ion - ion coulomb force .",
    "exactly the same formulas represent the exact derivative of @xmath6 in both diagonalisation and @xmath3 modes .    in both sc - aitb and full ai ,",
    "the force formula is : @xmath72 which differs from the second version of the nsc - aitb formula eqn  ( [ eq : nsc_aitb_2 ] ) only by the absence of the non - self - consistent contribution @xmath71 , as expected .",
    "the above hierarchy of force formulas has been implemented in conquest , and extensive tests have ensured that the total energy and the forces are exactly consistent within rounding - error precision@xcite .",
    "we have already demonstrated the ability of conquest to address non - trivial systems by relaxing the si(001 ) surface with a variety of basis sets , and comparing the results to geometries obtained with both siesta and vasp@xcite . in this section",
    ", we will present further results which show that conquest is now ready for application to real - world scientific problems .",
    "we start with the problem of self - consistency , and demonstrate both that the kerker preconditioning technique described in section  [ sec : summ - conq - techn ] above is extremely useful and that it does not degrade the linear scaling stability .",
    "we then present selected data from a study of the three - dimensional `` huts '' which evolve to relieve strain during heteroepitaxial growth of ge on si(001 ) .",
    "the search for self - consistency between the charge density and potential can still sometimes be problematic in standard dft codes : even with the most sophisticated , convergence to the ground state is not completely guaranteed . in this section , we present the results of tests on three different systems , demonstrating the effects of varying the mixing parameter , a , and the preconditioning wavevector , q@xmath73 in the kerker preconditioning , as discussed in section  [ sec : summ - conq - techn ] .",
    "the results will be both for exact diagonalisation and linear scaling ground state search methodologies , though we reserve the linear scaling results for the most challenging problem , presented last .",
    "we present the raw data ( change of residual with iteration ) for selected cases at the end of the section , along with data on the effect of region radius on convergence rate .",
    "the parameters used in modelling the systems are as follows : conquest was operating with a pao basis set at the single - zeta level ( with four orbitals per atom ) following the generation scheme in siesta , with cutoffs of 4.88 and 6.12 bohr on the s- and p - orbitals respectively ( corresponding to a shift of 250 mev on - site ) .",
    "there was no outer loop ( as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : summ - conq - techn ] above ) .",
    "the criterion applied for reaching self - consistency was @xmath42=0.01 for bulk silicon ( where @xmath42 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) above ) .",
    "this value of @xmath42 is perfectly adequate for total energy calculations though may be a little loose for accurate molecular dynamics ; for this purpose it is ideal as it is the early stages of the self - consistency search which are non - linear .",
    "for both the silicon surface and the cluster , the _ average _ electron density in the system is smaller owing to the vacuum present ; in both cases we used larger values of @xmath42 so that the effective convergence was the same ( for si(001 ) we set @xmath42=0.015 and for the silicon cluster @xmath42=0.039 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the starting charge density was a linear superposition of atomic charge densities generated from the pao basis functions .",
    "[ fig : bulksi_sc ]    we begin with the simplest possible system : bulk silicon . the results for a unit cell containing 512 atoms",
    "are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulksi_sc ] , purely for diagonalisation at the gamma point .",
    "as might be expected for such a simple system , there is no problem reaching the ground state , and in fact the kerker preconditioning is ineffective : at best it has no effect , and it often slows down the iterations .",
    "[ fig : si001_sc ]    we now move from a three - dimensional system to the si(001 ) surface .",
    "the results for a slab containing 192 atoms ( the unit cell was one dimer row long , eight dimers long , and 12 layers deep with a surface on both sides ) are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : si001_sc ] . the kerker preconditioning is vital here , with the value of q@xmath73 determining stability during the search .",
    "[ fig : sicluster_sc ]    finally we turn to an amorphous cluster of 343 silicon atoms , whose structure was optimised by a minima - hopping procedure@xcite .",
    "a projection of the structure of the cluster is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sicluster_sc ] , along with the convergence results .",
    "the results for exact diagonalisation have been reproduced with linear scaling to test the effect of kerker mixing on the stability of the algorithm ( shown with downward triangles ) . as is clear from the plot , the use of linear scaling for this cluster is not affected at all by the choice of self - consistency algorithm , and convergence _ to self - consistency _ is equally fast with either method .",
    "we note that the cluster is metallic ( or at least that there is partial occupation of a number of levels near the fermi level ) , leading to rather slow convergence of the density matrix minimisation ( though we note that the cutoff on the density matrix was 7 , which is not large enough to provide convergence to the diagonalisation result ) .",
    "nevertheless , the self - consistent ground state is achieved without significant difficulty .",
    "we note that the optimal values of @xmath74 found are in good agreement with those previously published , though there is little quantitative data available beyond ref .",
    "@xcite . in that publication",
    ", it was stated that values of @xmath74 in the range 0.52.0 @xmath75 yielded little change in the convergence rate .",
    "the factor to convert between bohr@xmath75 and @xmath75 which is required in order to compare this range to the data in figs .",
    "[ fig : bulksi_sc][fig : sicluster_sc ] is 1.8897 ( simply one bohr@xmath75 ) .",
    "then we see that , excluding bulk silicon , the acceptable range of 0.200.65 bohr@xmath75 for si(001 ) and 0.301.25 bohr@xmath75 for the cluster convert to 0.381.23  @xmath75 and 0.572.36  @xmath75 , in very good agreement .",
    "we also note that the problem of slow convergence for overly small mixing parameter a noted@xcite is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : si001_sc ] .",
    "[ fig : rawdata ]    the raw data , that is value of @xmath42 per iteration , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rawdata ] for the 343 atom cluster . for @xmath74=0.2 and a=0.1 , we show convergence for the single zeta pao basis ( circles ) and an _ unconverged _ blip basis ( squares ) .",
    "this shows that the convergence rate is only mildly dependent on choice of basis , or indeed on the convergence of the outer loop ( since the blips chosen were far from optimal ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath74=0.1 and a=0.4 , we show convergence for both exact diagonalisation ( diamonds ) and linear scaling ( triangles ) solvers .",
    "again , the rate of convergence is only mildly changed by this change of methodology .",
    "these results are illustrative of the general behaviour of the minimisation : the self - consistency scheme described is unaffected by the details of the inner or outer loops .",
    "[ fig : rawdatarc ]    finally , we present further a further plot of the residual per iteration for the 343 atom si cluster for different values of the region radius in fig .  [",
    "fig : rawdatarc ] . for this test ,",
    "we have again used single - zeta paos , with different techniques for generation .",
    "we used both the siesta energy shift ( yielding radii of 5.67/7.11 bohr for s / p with 100 mev , 5.26/6.43 bohr for 200 mev and 4.88/6.12 bohr for 300 mev ) and fixed radii for both s and p channels ( of 6.0 bohr , 6.6 bohr , 7.0 bohr and 8.0 bohr ) .",
    "we see that there is only a very small dependence of convergence on region radius .",
    "[ tab : ge105 ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we are currently investigating the stability of three - dimensional islands of ge on si(001 ) during strained heteroepitaxial growth@xcite , following our earlier studies of strained layer growth using conventional dft@xcite and linear scaling tight binding@xcite .",
    "after approximately three monolayers of ge has been deposited ( though this varies with the system and growth conditions ) , small mounds with well - defined facets begin to appear .",
    "these have facets made of the ge(105 ) surface , and allow significant strain relaxation .",
    "a first step in understanding these huts is to characterise the ge(105 ) surface@xcite , which we have done with conquest , in particular concentrating on the density matrix range required for accurate calculations .",
    "we present surface energy and maximum forces calculated using a minimal basis at the nsc - aitb level for a ge(105 ) surface in table  [ sec : hut - clusters - ge ] .",
    "( we note that the structure modelled here is a previously unreported insulating structure which will be presented in more detail elsewhere . )",
    "the surface energy was calculated using systems with eight layers and ten layers ( 100 and 124 atoms respectively ) the system was relaxed using exact diagonalisation ( with a @xmath76 monkhorst - pack mesh ) and this structure was used in the linear scaling calculations .",
    "we see that the maximum force is converged at a density matrix range of 20 or 25 bohr , but that the surface energy is more slowly convergent .",
    "nevertheless , this is a strong indication that reliable results can be obtained using linear scaling results it was found that the exact diagonalisation results were insufficiently converged with respect to the k - point mesh , and the mesh had to be increased . ] .",
    "[ fig : largehut_dmm ]    we have considered a number of different hut cluster systems , with different sizes and spacings on the substrate .",
    "the largest system which we have prepared so far contains approximately 23,000 atoms ( including substrate , wetting layer of ge and the hut cluster ) .",
    "we show the residual of the density matrix against iteration number in fig .",
    "[ fig : largehut_dmm ] , which demonstrates both that convergence to the ground state can be easily achieved for a system this large , and that the number of iterations needed to reach the ground state is independent of system size ( which is an important consideration for this type of code ) .",
    "[ fig : largehut_charge ]    finally , we present a preliminary charge density for this system in fig .",
    "[ fig : largehut_charge ] , where the colour indicates height in the unit cell .",
    "the isosurface was formed by sampling one grid point in four in each direction , to make the data set manageable .",
    "the charge density shows both the scale of the simulation and the dimers on the facets of the hut , as well as the characteristic buckling associated both with the si(001 ) surface and the ge(105 ) faces of the hut cluster .",
    "we have presented an overview of the methodology used in the conquest code , and shown that realistic calculations on complex , scientifically interesting systems are now possible . in particular , we have outlined the arrangement of the code to allow calculations at different levels of precision ( from minimal - basis aitb through to full _ ab initio _ ) and presented details of how forces can be calculated consistently at all levels of precision .",
    "we have shown details of convergence to self - consistency for various different systems , and outlined early results from our study of three - dimensional `` hut '' clusters resulting from heteroepitaxial growth of ge on si(001 ) .",
    "we want to note that there are other @xmath3 techniques within the dft arena , notably siesta@xcite , openmx@xcite and onetep@xcite .",

    "<S> while the success of density functional theory ( dft ) has led to its use in a wide variety of fields such as physics , chemistry , materials science and biochemistry , it has long been recognised that conventional methods are very inefficient for large complex systems , because the memory requirements scale as @xmath0 and the cpu requirements as @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the number of atoms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the principles necessary to develop methods with linear scaling of the cpu and memory requirements with system size ( @xmath3 methods ) have been established for more than ten years , but only recently have practical codes showing this scaling for dft started to appear . </S>",
    "<S> we report recent progress in the development of the conquest code , which performs @xmath3 dft calculations on parallel computers , and has a demonstrated ability to handle systems of over 10,000 atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the code can be run at different levels of precision , ranging from empirical tight - binding , through _ ab initio _ tight - binding , to full _ ab initio _ , and techniques for calculating ionic forces in a consistent way at all levels of precision will be presented . </S>",
    "<S> illustrations are given of practical conquest calculations in the strained ge / si(001 ) system . </S>"
