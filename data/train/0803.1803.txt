    "we use gas dynamical simulations of the nearly head - on collision of two unequal - mass clusters to model the `` bullet cluster '' 1e 0657 - 56 , to show that the high shock velocity of @xmath2 inferred from x - ray observations @xcite may exceed the relative velocity of the merging halos .",
    "previous estimates of the extremely small probability of finding such a high - velocity cluster - cluster collision in a @xmath0cdm universe assumed that the shock and the halo - collision velocities were the same @xcite .",
    "our results , first described in @xcite , significantly increase the likelihood of observing such a merger event in @xmath0cdm .",
    "we used the adaptive mesh - refinement ( amr ) asc flash code @xcite in 2d cylindrical coordinates to simulate a region @xmath3 mpc across , with @xmath4 kpc spatial resolution .",
    "gravity is contributed by two rigid , spherical dm halo profiles , whose centers free - fall toward each other from rest at separation @xmath5 mpc . the density associated with the gravitational force is an nfw profile @xmath6 for the subcluster , and a cored profile @xmath7 for the main cluster , to imitate a non - head - on merger .",
    "the masses ( @xmath8 ) and radii @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( mpc ) are @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the main cluster and subcluster , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "our simulations of merging galaxy clusters show that the halo collision velocity need not be the same as the intergalactic gas shock velocity . applying our correction to the speed of the subhalo , the probability that such a massive cluster in our cdm universe has such a high - speed subhalo increases by 3 orders of magnitude relative to previous estimates , but is still small ( @xmath13 ) . @xcite",
    "independently reached a similar conclusion , although their relative halo velocity is much smaller , @xmath14 .",
    "they assumed perfectly head - on collision between a cuspy main halo and a more concentrated subhalo than ours , which would make the subhalo decelerate more before reaching the observed separation .",
    "more recent simulations by @xcite show that the difference between the shock velocity and the halo relative velocity is smaller if the initial halo collision velocity is larger and if the collision is not perfectly head - on .",
