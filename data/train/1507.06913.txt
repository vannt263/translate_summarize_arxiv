    "such an approach requires the identification of both @xmath5 quarks decaying from the higgs boson in a single jet , hereafter referred to as a higgs jet ( @xmath1 jet ) .",
    "while the identification of an isolated jet stemming from the hadronization of a single @xmath5 quark ( @xmath5-tagging ) has been widely used in many experimental measurements , its application to the higgs jets is not trivial since a higgs jet has two @xmath5 quarks inside  @xcite . in this paper , we extend the studies presented in refs .",

    "the energies of particles entering each cell in each event , except for the neutrinos , are summed over and replaced with a massless pseudoparticle of the same energy , also referred as an energy cluster , pointing to the center of the cell .",
