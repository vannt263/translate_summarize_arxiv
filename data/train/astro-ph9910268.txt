    "the munics project is a wide area @xmath0-band selected photometric survey in the @xmath7 passbands aiming at two main scientific goals , namely    * the identification of galaxy clusters at redshifts around unity , and * the selection of a fair sample of field early - type galaxies at similar redshifts for evolutionary studies .    near - ir selection",
    "is an efficient tool for tracing the massive galaxy population at redshifts around unity because of its high sensitivity for evolved stellar populations even in the presence of moderate star formation activity .",
    "thus a @xmath8-band selected survey can provide a very useful database for the investigation of the formation and evolution of the cluster as well as the field population of massive galaxies .",
    "clusters of galaxies are of prime interest in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology .",
    "the @xmath9 evolution of their number density and correlation function are sensitive tests for structure formation theories and especially the density parameter @xmath10 .",
    "models of structure formation predict that if @xmath11 , the number density of clusters of richness class 1 declines by a factor of @xmath12 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . on the other hand , if @xmath15 , the number density declines only by a factor of @xmath16 in the same redshift range ( eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; bahcall , fan , & cen 1997 ; fan , bahcall , & cen 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , clusters of galaxies allow to find large numbers of massive galaxies at higher redshift and thus represent unique laboratories to study the evolution of galaxies in high density regions as a function of redshift . while the number of clusters known at redshifts @xmath17 is steadily increasing , _ uniformly selected _ samples of clusters at high redshift are still deficient in the optical and near - ir wavelength ranges .",
    "the formation and evolution of the population of massive galaxies is still a matter of lively and controversial debate .",
    "no general agreement has been reached yet regarding the formation era of spheroidals . while models of hierarchical galaxy formation ( cole et al .",
    "1993 ; kauffman & charlot 1998 ) consistently predict a steep decline in the number density of massive spheroidals , they have a rather large number of free parameters , some of which involve ill - understood processes . observation has not yet been successful in constraining the ranges of the involved model parameters tightly enough , so that comparisons between theory and experiment are difficult to interpret .",
    "moreover , measuring the evolution of the number density of early - type galaxies @xmath18 to redshifts of unity is by itself a difficult undertaking , suffering from too small samples and strong selection effects , therefore yielding contradictory results ( e.g. totani & yoshii 1998 ; benitez et al .",
    "1999 ; shade et al . 1999 ; broadhurst & bouwens 1999 ; barger et al .",
    "the munics project uniformly covers 1 square degree in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 near - ir bands .",
    "the survey area consists of 8 @xmath19 randomly selected fields at high galactic latitude , as well as 13 @xmath20 fields targeted towards @xmath6 qsos .",
    "the @xmath5 detection limits for a point source are @xmath21 in the @xmath0-band and @xmath22 in the @xmath1-band .",
    "the data have been acquired at the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto observatory using the @xmath23 camera .",
    "optical photometry in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bands was obtained for a subsample of the survey fields covering 0.35 square degrees in total .",
    "these data have been obtained at the 2.2 m telescope at calar alto observatory and the 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "these data will enable us to determine photometric redshifts for the galaxies and thus are of great importance in selecting and confirming cluster candidates as well as individual galaxies for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath0 vs. @xmath24 color magnitude diagrams for population synthesis models based on the bruzual & charlot 1995 code ( bruzual & charlot 2000 ) , together with a subsample of the munics data .",
    "note that the @xmath24 color of a late m - type star is @xmath25 , and therefore any object having redder color must be redshifted , with the exception of extreme stellar objects like brown dwarfs .",
    "those are not expected to be very numerous down to our sensitivity limits .",
    "therefore the @xmath24 color is a very powerful selection tool for picking out the evolved populations of massive galaxies at redshifts around unity and larger .",
    "figure 2 ( right panel ) shows the photometric redshift distribution of 371 galaxies which were detected in _ all _ 5 passbands in a small subarea of @xmath26 and have a @xmath24 color @xmath27 , confirming the usefulness of the @xmath24 selection .",
    "the left panel demonstrates that we can reliably reconstruct the sed of early - type galaxies at high redshift from our @xmath28 data .",
    "data reduction and calibration of the near - ir data is completed and reduction of the optical data is almost completed . here",
    "we present first results regarding detection of clusters and the surface density of eros .",
    "the surface density of extremely red objetcs ( eros ) defined in terms of @xmath24 as determined from 0.35 square degrees of data is given in table 1 .",
    "as soon as the optical data become fully available further investigation of the nature of such objects will be possible , as well as comparisons to previous studies which mostly use @xmath29 or @xmath30 for defining eros , and have surveyed much smaller areas at comparable depth .",
    ".surface densities as a function of @xmath24 color as derived from a total of 0.35 square degrees .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     assuming that the @xmath24 and @xmath31 colors for lbds 53w091 ( spinrad et al .",
    "1997 ) are typical for eros , all objects with @xmath32 have to be considered as ero candidates .",
    "the values of table 1 then point to higher surface densities than the values obtained by thompson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which were based on an @xmath33 color and a survey area of 0.04 square degrees .",
    "in recent years it became clear that an early type population in clusters was well in place at redshifts of at least 0.8 ( e.g. stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "thus we may hope to detect these clusters by looking for overdensities of red objects with colors resembling the color sequence of cluster early - type galaxies .",
    "the surface density field is divided into ( overlapping ) slices in @xmath24 color .",
    "these slices are then smoothed by a kernel of the angular size of a cluster core at the apropriate redshift for that particular color range .",
    "cluster candidates are identified as overdensities in this data cube .",
    "figure 3 shows the redshift distribution for objects in the vicinity of a high redshift cluster candidate detected in this fashion as a demonstration of the efficiency of the technique .",
    "the cluster candidate is first detected as an overdensity of red objects in @xmath24 . then this detection is verified by looking at the histogram of photometric redshifts in the vicinity of the cluster candidate .",
