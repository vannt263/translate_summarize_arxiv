    "nowadays , quantum correlation has been attracting much attention since it plays a crucial role in quantum computation and quantum information .",
    "entanglement , as an important quantum resource , takes responsibility for most quantum information tasks such as quantum teleportation and computation @xcite .",
    "but entanglement is fragile in open systems . environment induced decoherence destroys entanglement correlation in a short time , which makes quantum task difficult for implementation .",
    "however , recent reseach shows that entanglement may be not the only worker carrying on quantum tasks .",
    "the quantum correlation without entanglement may also take effect in some scenes , e.g. , the quantum computation with mixed states plus one pure qubit ( dqc1 ) @xcite .",
    "quantum discord is developed for the measure of `` quantumness '' of a pairwise correlation @xcite .",
    "it makes it clear that entanglement is one kind of nonclassical correlation but not all .",
    "the quantum discord of some separable states is also nonzero .",
    "it may be used as a powerful tool to study quantum correlations .",
    "lots of work has been devoted to the study of correlations in different processes , like decoherence and quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of formation @xcite does not behave smoothly like the correlation functions , and shows sudden death and rebirth in some scences @xcite , which attracts more and more researchers .",
    "the quantum discord is pointed out to signal the quantum phase transition @xcite like fidelity @xcite , while our previous work also find that in topological quantum phase transition ( tqpt ) the local correlations are classical and the quantum correlation hides in the global system @xcite .",
    "the topological order is a new kind of order beyond the conventional symmetry - breaking theory . in topological order system ,",
    "the degeneracy of the ground space depends on the topology of the system configuration , and the degenerate ground space is well protected against local perturbation .",
    "such properties can be used for fault - tolerant computation @xcite .",
    "another talent idea is the measurement - based computation , in which a _",
    "cluster state _ is prepared and measured as the computation process @xcite .",
    "there are deep relationship between these two methods of computation .",
    "in this paper , we study the pairwise correlations in a 1d cluster - like system with triplet interaction , which can be implemented in optical lattice @xcite .",
    "we discuss the properties of the topological order in the system , like the boundary dependent degeneracy and topological protection .",
    "we find the _ string order parameter _",
    "( sop ) by the method of duality map @xcite to characterize tqpt .",
    "furthermore , the system can be decomposed as two independent chains of odd and even sites respectively , namely , the spin on site @xmath0 is independent of spin on site @xmath1 where @xmath2 is integer , and we call this `` bridge correlated ''",
    ".    the divergency of quantum discord with the distance of two site is studied .",
    "we find that it behaves in the similar way as the correlation functions , i.e. , it decays exponentially in both topological and magnetic phase areas and diverges in reversed power law at the critical points .",
    "moreover , the study of the quantum discord and entanglement shows that the local quantum correlation of two sites is suppressed in topological phase area .",
    "this is different from the study in 2d tqpt @xcite , in which local quantum correlations vanish completely . and",
    "that means in tqpt systems the global difference of the topology caused by dimension can be reflected in the local quantum correlations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "finally , we draw summary in sec . v.",
    "in this section , we introduce the 1d cluster - like system originally proposed for quantum computation in optical lattice @xcite .",
    "we calculate the basic property of low - energy spectrum . in 1d world , there are not too many kinds of different topology that we are interested in , except for the open string and the closed loop , which correpond to open and periodic boundary conditions respectively . we show that the degeneracy of the ground space is different in these two cases .",
    "besides , the degeneracy is immune to local perturbation .",
    "these are the typical characters of topological order .",
    "and we find the sop to characterize the quantum phase transition .      here ,",
    "we describe the model we discussed .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is described as follows , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the pauli matrix acting on the @xmath0-th site and @xmath6 .",
    "the model is originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for quantum computation .",
    "it can be implemented in optical lattice .",
    "atoms are arranged in a triangle lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tlattice ] .",
    "tunneling happens in the nearest three sites , which gives rise to the triplet interaction term .",
    "the one body term can be adjusted by zeeman effect and appropriate laser field .        when @xmath7 , the ground space is the common eigenspace of @xmath8 s that satisfies @xmath9 , which is a typically cluster - like space @xcite .",
    "cluster states are a kind of graph states , which play an essential role in measurement - based quantum computation @xcite .    here",
    "we analyze the low energy spectrum of the system eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) in the stablizer scheme @xcite .",
    "all @xmath8 s commute with each other , so we can treat the ground space of the system as the protected space of a set of independent _ stabilizer genarators _ @xmath10 .    in the stabilizer scheme , we have @xmath11 qubits and @xmath12 independent stablizer genarators which are the products of pauli operator @xmath5 s .",
    "the stablizer genarators commute with each other , and the common eigenspace of the stablizers satisfying @xmath13 is called the _ protected space _ , whose dimension is just @xmath14 , i.e. , the stabilizers encode @xmath15 logical qubits in the protected space .",
    "assume we have @xmath11 sites in the system eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , when @xmath7 , it is easy to see that the number of @xmath8 s is @xmath11 under periodic boundary condition , and @xmath16 under the open boundary condition .",

    "that is to say , the ground space of the system eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) is undegenerated under the loop boundary condtion , and 4-fold degenerated when it is opened , with the absent of external field term .",
    "another important property of the system is that all the local correlation functions , except those composed of products of several @xmath8 s , are zero . as an example , for @xmath19 , we can always find certain @xmath20 which anti - commutes with @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 . and",
    "the system possesses @xmath23-symmetry , i.e. , @xmath24=0 $ ] .",
    "these are important properties as we will see below .",
    "when @xmath25 , by means of jordan - wigner transformation @xmath26 we can transform the system eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) into a fermion chain , @xmath27    we can see that the system can be regarded as two independent chains containing odd and even sites respectively .    under the periodic boundary condition , the system possesses translational invariance .",
    "so it can be diagonalized in fourier representation ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 . by using bogoliubov transformation",
    ", we get the diagonalized hamiltonian , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "when the string is opened , it is difficult to get the low energy spectrum and we will discuss the degeneracy of the ground space by perturbation method in the following part .      when the string is opened , the ground space is 4-fold degenerated when @xmath7 , as mentioned above .",
    "actually each independent chain contributes two states . in this part , we show that this degeneracy is protected against external local perturbations .",
    "more exactly speaking , the energy splitting caused by perturbation tends to zero in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "as the string is opened , fourier transformation does not take effect .",
    "we calculate the splitting of the ground state energy .",
    "assume the external field is absent at the time @xmath34 , and adiabatically switched on .",
    "that is to say , we construct a new hamiltonian with time - dependent external field @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is infinitely small . at @xmath37 ,",
    "the system comes back to eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath38 since @xmath39 is switched on adiabatically , the system evolves from the cluster - like ground state @xmath40 at @xmath34 to an eigenstate @xmath41 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) at @xmath37 , which should be one of the splitted ground states @xcite . the average energy of the state @xmath41",
    "is,@xmath42 @xmath43 $ ] is the time - ordered evolution operator , expanded as    @xmath44    where the perturbation term in interaction picture is @xmath45 ignoring the boundary terms without loss of generality . as @xmath46",
    ", we can see that the inner product in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) is composed of sum of multi - point correlation functions , which all vanish until the @xmath11th order according to what we see in the last part . in the @xmath11th term , global terms like @xmath47",
    "appear and take effect",
    ". we can interpret it as a virtual particle running along the whole string .",
    "therefore , the energy splitting of the ground space is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the length scale of the system . in thermodynamical limit , @xmath50 , the degeneracy is perfectly protected like the case in toric code @xcite .",
    "as we see , degeneracy emerges when the loop is opened . besides , the degeneracy is immune against local perturbation when it is not too strong .",
    "these properties show that the system is a topologically ordered system .",
    "we can see that there is a close relationship between cluster - like system and topological order . here",
    "we regard both the topology related degeneracy and topological protection as the essential character of topological order .",
    "topological order is an unconventional phase that can not be described by the symmetry - breaking of local order parameters @xcite .",
    "when @xmath51 , the system leaves the topological order and goes to a magnetized phase through quantum phase transition .",
    "we can find some global string order parameter to characterize the phase transition .",
    "bellow , we show how to find the sop by duality transformation @xcite .    under the periodic boundary condition",
    ", we make such duality transformation bellow to represent the system by another self - consistent pauli algebra @xmath52,@xmath53 the system turns to be an @xmath54-model , @xmath55    further , let @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the system can be mapped to ising model in an external field,@xmath58 we can also see that the system is actually composed of two independent chains . combining the two transformation together , we can see actually it is @xmath59 the three nearest sites in a triangle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tlattice ] ) make up a new site in the dual lattice .",
    "the regular triangles and the inverted ones construct two independent ising chains respectively .",
    "@xmath60 can be seen as the observable that measure the `` vortex '' of the @xmath0th triangle site , clockwised or counter - clockwised .",
    "lots of work has been devoted to discussing the quantum phase transition of ising model .",
    "there is a long - range order in the dual system @xcite .",

    "@xmath64 can be regarded as the order parameter characterizing the phase transition at @xmath65 . in the original spin representation",
    ", we can get the hidden sop as @xmath66 note that we are treating two independent ising chains .",
    "when the loop is opened , some boundary terms appears , whose effect can be neglected in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the physics does not change .",
    "here we emphasize that the existence of sop is not the sufficient condition of topological order .",
    "as we see , we can also get sop in the @xmath54-model eq .",
    "( [ eq : xy ] ) , i.e. , @xmath67 , by the duality map , which is a convensional symmetry - breaking system studied so much . however , duality mapping is a useful tool to help us find the nonlocal order in topological order system .",
    "in this section , we study the pairwise correlations in our cluster - like system , like the quantum discord and the entanglement of formation ( eof ) . quantum discord is used as a measure for the `` quantumness '' of a pairwise state .",
    "something interesting are found .",
    "we find that the quantum correlations are greatly suppressed in the topological order area compared with the magnetic polarized phase .",
    "the quantum discord decays exponentially as the distance of the two spins increases when @xmath68 , and diverges in reverse power law at critical points , in the behaviour exactly like the two - point correlation function .",
    "only the eof of the spins next - nearest is nontrivial , while that of spins further from each other vanishes .",
    "entanglement , as the most important quantum resource , has been discussed lots and there are many different kinds of measures .",
    "one of the most sophisticated is the entanglement of formation ( eof ) @xcite .",
    "entanglement of formation is an entanglement measure defined for bipartite quantum states as    @xmath69,\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 is the density matrix of the bipartite states and @xmath71 satisfies the condition that @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 is a bipartite pure state and @xmath74 gives the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix of @xmath75 . for pure states case",
    ", this quantity reduces to the entropy of entanglement . for two - qubit system ,",
    "fortunately , eof can be express with concurrence @xmath76 @xcite , @xmath77 where @xmath78 . the concurrence @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath80 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath81 .    mutual information @xcite quanlifies the amount of common information shared by two subsystems .",
    "the classical mutual information is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the shannon information and @xmath84 is the conditional information , which means the average information of @xmath85 we gain when knowing the result of @xmath86 .",
    "a natural generalized quantum version is by change the shannon information to von neumann entropy,@xmath87    another generalization follows by giving the quantum measurement version of conditional entropy .",
    "the conditional entropy implies a measurement on @xmath86 to get the information about @xmath85 .",
    "so we impose projective measurement @xmath88 on @xmath86 and collect the information,@xmath89 where @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "quantum discord is defined as the minima of the difference of @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xcite , @xmath93.\\ ] ] due to its power in mixed state quantum computation @xcite , it has been discussed a lot recently .    quantum discord can be used a measurement for the `` quantumness '' of the bipartite correlation .",
    "it clears that entanglement is not the only `` quantum '' state .",
    "for example , for a separable state @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , the quantum discord is not zero , which means @xmath70 contains nonclassical correlation .      to study the correlations in the system , we should first get the state of two spins , i.e. , their reduced density matrix .",
    "the pairwise density matrix can be decomposed by a set of basis @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 takes @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath96 is orthonormal under the hilbert - schmidt inner product @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the reduced density matrix of two spins can be written as@xmath102 where @xmath103 is the hilbert - schmidt inner product of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .    because of the @xmath23-symmetry of the system mentioned before , most terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdm ] ) can be elimited except that of @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "so we just need to calculate the expectation value of @xmath110 and @xmath111 . since the system can be treated as two independent fermion chain like eq .",
    "( [ eq : fermion ] ) , it can be seen that @xmath110 is zero when @xmath112 is odd .    from the jordan - wigner transformation eq .",
    "( [ eq : jw ] ) , we can get @xmath111 and @xmath113 directly ( we take @xmath114 without loss of generality).@xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we can check that @xmath118 when @xmath119 , and the complicated expression in the brackets above can be handled with the help of wick theorem @xcite .",
    "let @xmath120 , we have@xmath121 and we have @xmath122 now we can get the expressions of correlation functions above back into eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdm ] ) and we have the reduced density matrix of any two spins in the system .",
    "bellow , we will discuss the pairwise correlations in the system .",
    "now we discuss the correlations in the system .",
    "first , we calculate the eof of two local spins . as we know , the nearest two spins are irrelevant .",
    "we give the eof of the next - nearest spins shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eof ] .",
    "in fact , numerical results show that the eof of the two spins , whose distance is further than 2 , is zero .    .",
    "the entanglement is born at @xmath123 , and a sudden change happens at the critical point . , width=264 ]    in sec .",
    "ii , we noted that the quantum phase transition can be characterized by sop deduced from duality mapping , and the critical point lies at @xmath65 .",
    "we can see that the eof in `` most '' of the topological order area is zero and behaves like an order parameter , which is similar to the logarithmic negativity in previous work @xcite .",
    "however , the eof is born before reaching @xmath65 , at the point around @xmath124 .",
    "there is a tiny `` gap '' at the critical point , which results from the finite scale , and that would eliminate to a singular point in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "( a )        ( b )        we can not treat eof as an order parameter .",
    "however , it tells us that in the topological order area , local bipartite entanglement , as an important quantum correlation , is greatly suppressed .",
    "it invokes us to study the total quantum correlations in this area .",
    "second , we calculate the quantum discord of two spins with distance @xmath112 in different magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : discord ] ) , where @xmath112 is even . around the point @xmath125",
    ", quantum discord has a tiny gap similar to that of eof .",
    "these behaviours both root in the property of correlation functions and would eliminate to a singular point in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "( a )        ( b )        it was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that in a 2d tqpt , local correlations are always classical and the quantum correlations hides in the whole lattice , which also happens in many other 2d tqpt systems .",
    "but things are different in 1d system ( see fig . [",
    "fig : discord ] ) .    in 2d topological order systems , there often exist many different conservative string operators whose paths are topologically equivalent , and we can always find one that anti - commutes with certain local observable .",
    "therefore , most local correlation functions would be eliminated and the density matrix eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdm ] ) become diagonalized .",
    "however , in 1d systems , degrees of freedom are restricted .",
    "there are not so many topologically equivalent conservative string operators as in 2d .",
    "the 1d systems do not pocess such high symmetry as in 2d systems , and many local correlation functions survive .",
    "the quantum discord , which measures the quantumness of pairwise correlations , only gives zero at the cluster state when @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , qualitatively speaking , we can see that the quantum discord is still quite small in most of the topological order area compared with that in the area @xmath126 .",
    "and we say that the local quantum correlation is greatly suppressed in the topological phase area .",
    "on the other hand , this means in tqpt systems the global difference of topology induced by dimension is reflected in the local quantum correlations .",
    "the dimension constrains the topology of the system , and also the types of global conservative quantities . in systems with higher dimension like ref .",
    "@xcite , the external field term breaks some global conservative operators , while the survival ones are still capable to eliminate local quantum correlations . however , in 1d systems like what we study in this paper , there are not enough global conservative quantities left in th presence the magnetic field and the local quantum correlations are just suppressed .",
    "the survival of local quantum correlation reflects the global restriction of the topolgy induced by dimension .    besides , we are interested in the decay behaviour of quantum discord along with the increase of the distance of the two spins we study .",
    "numerical results show that the decay behaviours of the quantum discord and total mutual information eq .",
    "( [ eq : mi ] ) are just similar to that of two - point correlation functions , i.e. , they decay exponentially when @xmath68 and with reversed power law at the critical points .",
    "this is different from the sudden change behaviour of eof , although eof and quantum discord are defined in a similar way , namely , by finding the extremum .",

    "the degeneracy of the ground space differs in closed and open boundary conditions , and the degeneracy is topologically protected .",
    "we obtained the global sop of this system by the method of duality mapping to characterize the tqpt .",
    "further , we discuss quantum correlations of this system . we calculate the quantum discord , mutual information and entanglement in this system .",
    "the eof of two local spins is `` dead '' in most of the topological order area .",
    "together with the study of quantum discord , we believe the quantum correlation is greatly suppressed in the topological order area .",
    "this is different from previous work in 2d tqpt @xcite , where local quantum correlations all vanish .",
    "we believe that is because in 1d systems , there is not so rich topology or high symmetry as in 2d systems .    on the other hand , in topological order systems ,",
    "the dimension of the configuration constrains the topology of global conservative quantities .",
    "this global difference of topology induced by dimension can be reflected in the local quantum correlations .",
    "for example , the local quantum correlations survive in 1d tqpt systems , while completely vanish in 2d , where there are more global conservative quantities left which root in the richer topology of 2d systems .",
    "besides , we study the divergency behaviour of the correlations .",
    "the quantum discord and mutual information diverge in reversed power law at the critical points and exponentially elsewhere .",
    "we believe more work can be done on the study of the universal scaling behaviour of the divergency ."
