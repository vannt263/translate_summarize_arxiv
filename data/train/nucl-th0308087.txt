    "one of the most compelling motivations for studying heavy ion collisions is the prospect for observing the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is accompanied by the creation of a quark - antiquark condensate whose coupling to nucleons is responsible for the great bulk of the nucleon mass , and is therefore responsible for most of the mass of the universe .",
    "the transient nature of the heavy - ion reaction precludes a detailed investigation of all the quasi - particle modes in the highly excited collision volume .",
    "however , the @xmath1 meson is unique for it typically decays inside the spatial region where the vacuum structure might undergo novel changes .",
    "a neutral @xmath1 decays with 99% probability into a @xmath0 pair and decays with a small probability into @xmath5 or @xmath6 pairs .",
    "the electromagnetic channels are especially useful because dilepton pairs will largely leave the collision volume unscathed by interactions with the thousands of other constituents .",
    "since the @xmath1 has the same quantum numbers as the photon , the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons is dominated by the @xmath1 for masses between 600 and 800 mev .",
    "experiments at the cern sps for @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite suggest that the @xmath1 has either dissolved @xcite ( as would be expected in a quark - gluon plasma ) , has moved down a few hundred mev @xcite ( due to chiral symmetry restoration ) , or has been broadened via collisions by many hundreds of mev @xcite .",
    "recently , the possibility of studying in - medium properties of the @xmath1 meson through the @xmath0 channel has been discussed @xcite . unlike dileptons , pions are not penetrating probes and are likely to re - interact before they escape .",
    "since temperatures fall to near 100 mev at breakup , where the @xmath7 ratio falls to a few percent , the chance that a @xmath8 is accompanied by a @xmath9 that originated from the same @xmath1 , rather than a charged pion from a different source , is only a few percent .",
    "thus , a background subtracted invariant mass distribution should have a @xmath1 peak that comprises only a few percent of the integrated distribution .",
    "the star collaboration at rhic has measured such a peak in @xmath10 collisions , and for the first time , in peripheral relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "a surprisingly significant downward shift of the mass was observed even in @xmath10 collisions , especially at low @xmath11 , and an even larger shift was observed in peripheral au + au collisions .",
    "results are not yet available for central collisions where it is more difficult to observe the peak since the @xmath7 ratio falls .",
    "eventually , the @xmath1 peak should also be measured for central collisions given sufficient statistics .    in references @xcite and @xcite , the mass distribution was predicted by considering the in - medium rate of @xmath1 decays into @xmath0 pairs , @xmath12 .",
    "this is the same approach as has been applied for dilepton studies . in reference",
    "@xcite , these rates were corrected for collision broadening and for bose effects .",
    "collision broadening was shown to be particularly important in moving strength to lower - lying masses . however , emission of pions is of a fundamentally different character than that of dileptons .",
    "first , the final - state distribution is not necessarily proportional to the decay rate since the decay rate is often balanced by a formation rate of similar magnitude .",
    "secondly , collisional broadening can not be applied in the same manner since measurements are made in the asymptotic state .",
    "finally , the presence of the @xmath1 alters the two - pion scattering partial waves at non - zero separations which should affect the mass distribution .",
    "as we will demonstrate , the production - rate calculations of @xcite and @xcite provide different results than a freeze - out prescription which is governed by the available phase space .",
    "if the last strong interactions felt by the two pions used in the distribution can be considered sufficiently hard to statistically sample the outgoing phase space , the two - pion density of states should govern the invariant mass distribution .",
    "other non - randomizing interactions , identical particle symmetrization and mean field interactions , would then serve to modify the density of states .",
    "although these @xmath1s probably decayed during the breakup stage , which is well below the critical density , the decaying @xmath1 mesons might still sample a region where mean - field effects , i.e. , in - medium mass shifts , are not negligible .",
    "since pions are goldstone bosons , they probably leave the region with their energy and momenta unchanged during their exiting trajectory , and one expects that a modification of the 2-pion invariant mass distribution would reflect the in - medium modifications of the @xmath1 rather than those of the pion . whereas , this mass shift may be on the order of 100 mev at high temperature , it is unlikely to be much more than 25 mev at breakup when densities have fallen well below nuclear density .",
    "it is not the aim of the current paper to model the in - medium mass shift of the @xmath1 , but rather to investigate how the invariant - mass distribution would look in a thermal description based entirely on the two - pion density of states , and the associated bose effects . in the next section ,",
    "methods for calculating the two - particle density of states are presented along with a comparison with the functional forms one would expect from rate calculations .",
    "after convoluting with the boltzmann weighting , we find that the @xmath1 peak is shifted downward by @xmath13 mev relative to the nominal @xmath1 mass .",
    "the shift is due to three factors , the boltzmann weighting @xcite , the fact that the density of states peaks below the @xmath1 mass , and the inclusion of other partial waves .",
    "bose - einstein effects also enhance the distribution at lower masses @xcite , especially for heavy ion collisions where the pionic phase space filling factors are approaching unity @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : bose ] methods are presented for including bose effects into the two - pion density of states",
    ". the resulting mass distribution is strengthened at lower invariant masses , but the peak did not shift appreciably .",
    "since the first measurements of the @xmath1 meson @xcite , the masses and widths have fluctuated by several mev depending on the analysis . currently , the particle data group assigns a nominal mass of 771.1 mev and a width of 149.2 mev @xcite , with uncertainties for each number being near 1 mev .",
    "the @xmath1 mass has been determined from a number of means , @xmath14 reactions , @xmath10 collisions , and @xmath15 reactions @xcite .",
    "electro - production of the @xmath1 is complicated by the interference with the @xmath16 channel @xcite which constructively interferes with the @xmath17 channel since the electromagnetic coupling violates isospin conservation .",
    "since @xmath10 collisions are typically highly inelastic , extracting the @xmath1 mass is complicated by the same factors that complicate the study in a heavy - ion environment . in the @xmath18 reaction ,",
    "the proton is treated as a source of pions which are assumed to scatter elastically with the incoming pions .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 phase shift analyses have been successfully performed . the cross section for @xmath0 reactions should have a breit - wigner form , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the momentum of either pion in the center - of - mass frame ( @xmath21 ) , and",
    "@xmath22 is the imaginary part of the one - loop self energy of the relativistic propagator .",
    "@xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the nominal width , and @xmath25 is the momentum required to provide the nominal mass , @xmath26 .",
    "the last term , @xmath27 is a form factor whose exact form is in doubt@xcite .",
    "the product @xmath28 peaks precisely at the nominal mass irrespective of the form factor .",
    "the spectral function of the @xmath1 is related to the imaginary part of the propagator , @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is usually associated with the number of states available to the @xmath1 with a given mass . the real part of @xmath31 is being ignored for the current discussion . since the breit - wigner function , @xmath32 , always peaks at @xmath33 , and since @xmath34 is rapidly growing with @xmath35 near the @xmath1 mass , the spectral function always peaks below the @xmath1 mass . setting the form factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : piself ] ) to unity , the peak of the @xmath1 spectral function shifts downward by 5 mev . applying some of the different expressions for @xmath22 discussed in @xcite may result in the peak",
    "being shifted further downward , perhaps as much as an additional 5 mev .",
    "the change in the total density of states can be expressed in terms of phase shifts , @xcite : @xmath36 given the relation between the phase shift and the self energy , one can express @xmath37 in terms of the self energy , @xmath38 the first term is the spectral function of the @xmath1 , which is often associated with the probability of having a @xmath1 meson of mass @xmath35 .",
    "together , the two terms describe the entire correction to the density of states , including the effects of modifying the outgoing partial waves .     the spectral function of the @xmath1 ( dotted line ) is broader than the breit - wigner form ( dashed line ) .",
    "the total density of states , including effects of modifying the outgoing partial waves , is noticeably shifted to the left relative to the other forms .",
    "the difference is especially noticeable at small invariant masses , where the three forms rise proportional to @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath20 respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure [ fig : spectral ] illustrates the importance of using the correct expression for the density of states .",
    "the spectral function of the @xmath1 is peaked below the breit - wigner function , and the total density of states is peaked even lower .",
    "the difference is especially strong at low invariant masses , as the breit - wigner function rises as @xmath39 , the @xmath1 spectral function rises as @xmath40 and the pionic density of states rises as @xmath20 .",
    "this relative scaling with @xmath20 would hold for any @xmath3-wave interaction .    thus far",
    ", the distribution of masses has not incorporated the boltzmann factor , which should push the peak even lower with the thermal weight , @xmath41 @xcite . more precisely , one needs to integrate over the modes in momentum space due to relativistic effects , @xmath42 this should represent the background - subtracted 2-pion invariant - mass distribution . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndm ] , the boltzmann weight pushes the distribution increasingly downward for lower temperatures .",
    "the upper panel shows the mass distribution assuming a temperature of 170 mev , which is a reasonable temperature for thermal models of @xmath10 collisions , while the lower panel shows the result for a temperature of 110 mev , which may be reasonable for the breakup temperature in central heavy ion collisions .",
    "calculations using both the @xmath1 spectral function and the two - pion density of states are displayed to illustrate the importance of choosing the appropriate form for the density of states .",
    "the boltzmann factor greatly magnifies the enhancements at low @xmath35 , to the point that a second peak appears for lower temperature .",
    "the thermal mass distribution of @xmath0 pairs is shown for three calculations , both at @xmath43 mev and @xmath44 mev . using the full density of states as calculated from taking derivatives of phase shifts results in a broader distribution for the @xmath45 channel ( full line ) than using the @xmath1 spectral function ( dotted line ) .",
    "including all @xmath46 , @xmath3 and @xmath47 channels ( dashed line ) provides significant strength at low invariant masses due to the @xmath46 wave channels and moderate strength at higher masses from the @xmath47 wave channels.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the @xmath0 density of states is also affected by phase shifts in other channels . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath46-wave channel is split into two isospin components , 2/3 weight for @xmath48 and 1/3 weight for @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath48 channel is particularly important as it corresponds to the mythical @xmath50 meson .",
    "although phase shift analyses do not reveal a sharp peak as in a resonance @xcite , the phase shifts are considerable , rising steadily from zero at threshold to approximately 90 degrees at @xmath51 gev , where the kaon channel opens . at the two - kaon threshold ,",
    "the behavior of the phase shifts becomes complicated and an inelastic treatment becomes warranted . since one uses derivatives of the phase shifts to find the density of states , interpolating data for phase shifts can be dangerous due to noise in the experimentally determined phase shifts .",
    "thus , we apply a simple form that describes the general behavior , @xmath52 the first coefficient @xmath53 is the scattering length , which is small due to constraints from chiral symmetry .",
    "the number varies throughout the literature by several tens of percent .",
    "we use the value , @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the second term does not contribute to the scattering length , as @xmath55 at low @xmath20 .",
    "choosing @xmath56 gev@xmath57 crudely reproduces experimental phase shifts , which are reviewed in @xcite . since these phase shifts rise half as far as those in the delta channel , have one third the spin degeneracy , and have a 2/3 weight in the @xmath0 channel , they are noticeably less important than the @xmath1 channel in affecting the overall density of states , unless one is near the two - pion threshold where @xmath3-wave interactions vanish .",
    "other phase shifts also contribute : @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "since none of these phase shifts exceed more than a few degrees , they make nearly negligible contributions to the density of states .",
    "for the @xmath58 channel , we apply an effective range expansion @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath62 mev@xmath57 and @xmath63 mev@xmath57 . the @xmath47 wave is also composed of @xmath48 and @xmath49 pieces . for the @xmath59 piece ,",

    ".    figure [ fig : dndm ] also shows the invariant mass distribution of a thermal ensemble with @xmath43 mev using all the @xmath46 , @xmath3 and @xmath47 channels .",
    "the @xmath46-wave contributions are non - negligible near the @xmath1 mass , and dominate near the two - pion threshold .",
    "the @xmath47-wave contributions matter only for masses near or greater than 1.0 gev .",
    "bose einstein corrections should preferentially enhance low - mass pairs since low - mass pairs are more likely to include a low - momentum pion .",
    "this has been investigated within the context of the @xmath1 peak as well as the influence on @xmath67 boson decay modes @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we present a means to include bose enhancement effects which are consistent with the statistical picture described in the previous section .    in order to demonstrate bose enhancement effects",
    ", we revert to the fundamental definition of the two - particle density of states .",
    "@xmath68 we will work in the two - pion rest frame , so the trace would cover all two - pion states that have total momentum zero .",
    "when including bose effects , one would sum all such two - pion states , plus average over the distribution of other identical particles whose probability of being populated is @xmath69 thus , @xmath70 can be considered as an bose enhancement factor while @xmath71 is the phase space filling factor if bose statistics were neglected .    using the cyclic property of the trace ,",
    "( [ eq : rhodef ] ) can be written in terms of a derivative with respect to @xmath35 , @xmath72 one can expand the @xmath73 terms and note that the sum includes all possible orderings of @xmath73 factors where each factor is either the principal value piece , which is real , or the imaginary part which is proportional to the density of states .",
    "one could restrict this sum to cover only those terms where the first factor is the imaginary part and multiply by a factor of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the number of times that @xmath76 appears in the term .",
    "the sum over @xmath73 can then be transformed into a sum of all possible numbers of appearances of the real part .",

    "analyses of @xmath111 correlations from rhic indeed point to high phase space densities @xcite , especially for central collisions of heavy ions .",
    "as expected , lower - mass states were more enhanced by bose effects . since the density of states was proportional to the derivative of @xmath112 , and",
    "since the averaged phase space filling factors generally fall as @xmath35 increases , the density of states was less enhanced for intermediate masses as compared to the no - bose case .",
    "the peak of the distribution shifted downward by only one mev after the inclusion of bose effects .",
    "although the position of the peak was not much affected by bose effects shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndm_bose ] , bose effects led to a near doubling of the distribution at low masses .",

    "a movement of the @xmath1 peak was observed for low @xmath11 pairs@xcite which is suggestive of bose effects .",
    "however , at the @xmath1 peak each pion has a relative momentum of @xmath113 mev / c and will largely sample phase - space regions with moderate to low phase space densities . although the invariant mass distribution is mainly altered at invariant masses below the @xmath1 peak , bose effects should contribute to washing out the peak by increasing the declining background to the peak structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndm_bose ] .",
    "our principal finding is that the @xmath1 peak in the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution should be approximately 35 mev lower than the nominal @xmath1 mass , if one accepts the scenario of a sudden breakup that thermally samples the two - pion density of states .",
    "the shift was the result of convoluting the density of states which is shifted by @xmath4 10 mev below the @xmath1 mass with the boltzmann factor . given the extra cooling inherent to heavy ion collisions , the breakup temperature is probably near 110 mev , well below the characteristic temperatures used to describe @xmath10 collisions .",
    "this low temperature is responsible for the additional downward shift of the peak in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in addition to the shift of the peak , the distribution showed significant additional strength at invariant masses near the two - pion threshold . this additional strength hinged on using the correct expressions for the density of states , especially in the @xmath108 channels .",
    "although the position of the peak was not much affected by bose effects , bose effects led to a near doubling of the distribution at low masses .",
    "the thermal model presented here rests critically on a pair of assumptions .",
    "first , we have assumed that the breakup is sudden , i.e. , the last strong interaction experienced by the particles samples the outgoing two - particle phase space . indeed , interferometric measurements do suggest a sudden breakup @xcite .",
    "if emission were gradual , e.g. , surface evaporation , this picture would be invalid .",
    "an appropriate treatment of the surface would include the dynamics of surface penetration and absorption and might include collisional broadening .",
    "for instance , spectral lines in stars are affected by collisional broadening .",
    "the `` truth '' of the breakup at rhic probably has elements of both volume - like breakup and surface - like evaporation .",
    "thus , the effect of collisions , which played a pivotal role in moving the distribution downward in @xcite , requires more study .",
    "the second assumption inherent to these calculations is related to the neglect of finite - size effects .",
    "the enhancement factors applied to small - angle correlation studies are usually based on the outgoing wave function , @xmath114 @xcite . for large sources , there is a straight - forward correspondence between the integrated wave functions and the phase shifts @xcite , @xcite , @xmath115 since the modification of the wave function is mostly confined to a region where @xmath116 , one expects that the treatments shown here should work well for @xmath117 mev / c , or for masses greater than 400 mev . for masses near threshold , a different approach , based on the actual scattered wave functions ,",
    "would be warranted .",
    "such an approach could also incorporate the effects of the coulomb interaction between pions .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that other correlations , besides those resulting from the change in the two - pion density of states , will play a role in any experimental measurement .",
    "experimental analyses are typically based on a like - sign subtraction .",
    "this should eliminate global correlations such as elliptic flow which correlate same - sign and opposite - sign pairs equally .",
    "however , any correlation based on charge conservation should survive the subtraction @xcite .",
    "for every @xmath8 , there is a @xmath118% chance that local charge conservation will result in an extra @xmath9 being emitted with a similar rapidity .",
    "this should provide a bump in the like - sign - subtracted invariant - mass distribution that peaks for masses near 400 mev .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath1 peak in the like - sign subtracted distribution to the bump from charge correlation is approximately determined by the chance that a given @xmath8 had its last interaction with other hadrons through the decay of a @xmath17 .",
    "this ratio should be smaller for central collisions since the breakup temperature is lower which reduces the @xmath7 ratio .",
    "the in - medium mass of the @xmath1 might be altered by @xmath420 mev at breakup . given that this peak is also spread out and distorted as shown in the calculations presented here , it is certainly challenging to isolate the contribution from the @xmath1 and to quote a peak height to a better accuracy than 20 mev . upcoming runs at rhic may increase the statistics by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "thus , we believe that there remains a good chance that the @xmath1 can be studied in detail , even in the central collision au+au environment .    finally , we compare the experimentally observed mass shifts to results of our model . in reference",
    "@xcite it was reported that the @xmath1 shift downward in @xmath10 collisions by @xmath119 mev at higher @xmath11 while shifting downward by @xmath120 at low @xmath11 .",
    "the shift appeared to be 5 to 10 mev larger for high - muliplicity @xmath10 collisions and perhaps another 5 mev lower for peripheral au+au reactions .",
    "similar behavior for @xmath10 collisions had been reported for @xmath121 gev @xmath10 collisions @xcite .",
    "the shifts that we extracted were as large 35 mev , but these calculations assumed a lower temperature , 110 mev , and a higher effective chemical potential , 90 mev , than would be appropriate for @xmath10 phenomenology .",
    "for a temperature of 170 mev , and zero chemical potential , the shift was in the range of 20 mev , a somewhat smaller shift than what was observed by star .",
    "it appears that the experimental mass shift is 10 to 20 mev stronger than what we would expect from our approach .",
    "but , before this discrepancy can be attributed to novel in - media phenomena , i.e. , a mass shift of the @xmath1 , it should be stressed that systematic uncertainties described in @xcite are of the order of 10 mev .",
    "this problem would be served well by both a higher statistics experimental analysis and a more detailed theoretical modeling .",
    "an improved calculation would consider finite - size effects , the influence of other resonances , and the effects of experimental acceptances and efficiencies .",
