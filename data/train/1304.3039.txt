    "the discovery of superconductivity in feas based compounds in 2008 with a critical temperature @xmath3 up to @xmath4  k  @xcite was the beginning of a large and fast - evolving field dedicated to these new types of superconductors .",
    "these materials like for example lifeas  @xcite , smfeaso  @xcite and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  @xcite share the structural motif of feas layers in which superconductivity can emerge either by doping and/or by external pressure with critical temperatures of up to @xmath5  k. one material of great interest is the compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 of the 122-type family , which shows interesting behavior under external pressure and temperature . at room temperature and ambient pressure ,",
    "the crystallographic structure of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is that of the body - centered tetragonal thcr@xmath0si@xmath0-type structure ( space group @xmath6 ) with poor pauli - paramagnetic metallic behavior and high electrical resistivity  @xcite . upon lowering of the temperature ,",
    "the material undergoes a structural and magnetic transition to the low - temperature orthorhombic @xmath7 structure  @xcite with a stripe - ordering of the fe magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "external hydrostatic or uni - axial pressure is capable of suppressing the magnetically ordered orthorhombic phase and induces the tetragonal paramagnetic phase with a region of superconductivity  @xcite at low temperatures . at higher pressures ,",
    "the collapsed tetragonal phase emerges  @xcite , where experiments as well as recent theoretical investigations  @xcite find different values for the critical pressure , which seems to be sensitive to temperature . at @xmath8",
    "k , values of @xmath9  gpa under nonhydrostatic pressure conditions  @xcite and @xmath10  gpa  @xcite under hydrostatic pressure conditions are reported , whereas at @xmath11 k a critical pressure of @xmath12 gpa was found  @xcite .",
    "also hysteresis effects of the temperature or a coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phase might be present for a wide range of pressures  @xcite .",
    "these experimental results show that the critical pressures and their possible temperature dependence are not yet fully understood .    in recent years",
    ", there have been quite a few theoretical studies of structural effects in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the phase transitions at zero temperature were studied with car parrinello molecular dynamics with friction  @xcite , highlighting the importance of fermi surface nesting for the nature of the phase transitions .",
    "a combination of dft total energies and thermodynamical quantities estimated from experiment was used to rationalize some finite temperature transition points in the phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "constant volume dft relaxations have been used to study the zero temperature pressure - induced structural transitions and equation of state both for hydrostatic  @xcite and nonhydrostatic  @xcite pressure conditions .",
    "the phase transitions in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 have also been studied using the fast inertial relaxation engine  @xcite , which allows an unconstrained equilibrium structure search for arbitrary stress tensors .",
    "this method has been used to work out effects of uniaxial pressure along * c * direction  @xcite and also in the @xmath13 plane  @xcite . since most studies so far used either experimentally measured or zero - temperature optimized structures , the complex temperature and pressure phase diagram of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 calls for microscopic first principles calculations at finite temperature .",
    "therefore , in this study we extend the theoretical toolbox for the study of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 to include finite temperatures .",
    "we employ _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) methods combined with finite temperature and pressure molecular dynamics .",
    "we specifically investigate the temperature behavior of the structural transitions and electronic properties .",
    "to our knowledge , no theoretical investigations of the finite temperature regime with external pressure of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 have been carried out before .",
    "therefore , our results can provide a useful complement to existing @xmath14  k theoretical calculations and can help to clarify the contradicting observations that are reported for the transition pressures in experiments .",
    "we performed the molecular dynamics calculations using the atomic simulation environment ( ase )  @xcite interface combined with the dft vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite , version 5.2.11 , with the projector augmented wave basis  @xcite in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) by perdew , burke and ernzerhof  @xcite .",
    "to control the temperature and pressure , the berendsen dynamics  @xcite provided by ase were employed , using characteristic time - constants of @xmath15  fs , @xmath16  fs for the thermostat and barostat , respectively , and a time step of @xmath17  fs for the integration of the equations of motion .",
    "the energy cut - off in vasp was set to @xmath18  ev and a monkhorst - pack uniform grid of @xmath19 k - points was used for the integration of the brillouin zone . to account for the magnetic stripe - order",
    ", we simulate a @xmath20 supercell of the conventional orthorhombic unit cell of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 containing 8  fe atoms .",
    "calculations were performed on a pressure - temperature grid with 13 different values of @xmath21 going from @xmath22  gpa to @xmath23  gpa in @xmath24  gpa steps and for temperatures of @xmath25  k , @xmath26  k , @xmath27  k and @xmath28  k. the values of observables were obtained by averaging over the last @xmath18  fs of the trajectory after the configuration was sufficiently equilibrated .",
    "we now present our results for the lattice parameters , magnetic moments and volume at temperatures between @xmath25  k and @xmath28  k compared to a zero - temperature relaxation  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ res : lattice_parameters ] we show the pressure dependence of the three lattice parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 at @xmath1  k , which is very similar to the @xmath14 k case .",
    "we observe a transition from the orthorhombic to tetragonal structure at about @xmath32 gpa and a second transition from the tetragonal to a collapsed tetragonal structure which is around @xmath33 gpa . for low values of pressure ,",
    "_ i.e. _ , our results are almost identical to the @xmath14 k calculation , with our obtained values for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 axis being slightly longer in comparison .",
    "the reason for that is clearly given by finite temperature which leads to internal pressure due to the temperature fluctuations of the atomic position and thus increasing the volume of the unit cell compared to the @xmath14 k case .    the position of the transition to the tetragonal phase is visible as a sudden increase in the lattice parameter @xmath30 at around @xmath32 gpa .",
    "the position of the transition is in agreement with the @xmath14 k result but the resulting configuration is not a perfect tetragonal unit cell , with the orthorhombic distortion significantly reduced but still non - zero .",
    "the @xmath34-ratio drops from @xmath35 at @xmath36 gpa to @xmath37 at @xmath32 gpa and retains a value larger than one up to @xmath38 gpa .",
    "even though all the lattice parameters noticeably differ from the @xmath14 k results in some cases , our obtained volume of the unit cell is still very similar ( see fig .  [",
    "res : lattice_parameters ] c ) ) .    for increasing pressure",
    "we find the average distance of the iron and arsenic atoms in the fe - as tetrahedron layers to be reduced and the orthorhombic transition is visible as a kink in the fe - as distance plot .",
    "our results closely match the zero temperature calculation and correctly indicate the orthorhombic to tetragonal transition around @xmath32 gpa ( see fig .",
    "[ res : lattice_parameters ] ( f ) ) .",
    "the tetragonal to collapsed tetragonal transition at zero temperature is marked by a sudden increase of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 and a decrease in the @xmath31 lattice constant at @xmath39 gpa .",
    "our results show a smoothed - out transition with less drastic changes in the lattice parameters at @xmath40 gpa .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 lattice parameters increase by @xmath41 from @xmath42 gpa to @xmath33 gpa , whereas the increase for @xmath14 k is @xmath43 from @xmath10 gpa to @xmath23 gpa .",
    "the @xmath31 lattice parameter shows a similar behavior , where in the zero temperature case a distinct decrease at @xmath39 gpa is visible , but our results show a smooth behavior of @xmath31 that looks almost linear with no sharp drop .",
    "the most notable difference between finite temperature and previous zero temperature results is the non - tetragonal but intermediate orthorhombic - tetragonal structure of our system for values of pressure where the @xmath14 k structure is already completely tetragonal .",
    "thus , our calculations obtain a smooth transition rather than sudden change of the lattice parameters for the o@xmath44 t transition and also for the t@xmath44ct transition .",
    "this is to be expected since due to the temperature fluctuations the system is allowed to oscillate between two competing structural configurations and magnetic orderings close to the critical pressure at @xmath14 k. our result suggests that this phase , which is intermediate between orthorhombic and tetragonal phases , is the best approximation we can get with our 20 atom supercell to a mixed phase . as a result , the o@xmath44 t transition is smoothed out to higher pressures , whereas the t@xmath44ct transition experiences strong smearing effects .",
    "this behavior is strongly enhanced for higher temperature , where the o@xmath44 t transition is shifted to even higher pressures of about @xmath45  gpa and the t@xmath44ct transition becomes almost indiscernible .",
    "this gives interesting effects in the relative change of the lattice parameters with temperature , which we will discuss below .",
    "the increase of the volume of the unit cell and the lattice parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 with temperature can be seen in fig .",
    "[ res : thermal_exp ] . for @xmath26",
    "k the volume increases slightly at all pressures compared to @xmath1 k , with different behavior at the critical pressures . up to the first transition , the increase of the volume with temperature decreases as expected due to higher pressure and then shows a peak right at @xmath32 gpa , which is caused by the temperature induced shift of the o@xmath44 t transition , _",
    "i.e. _ the sudden decrease in volume , to higher pressures . in all of the regions we identified , except in the tetragonal phase the relative volume increase falls off almost monotonically until the transition to the next phase , where it shows a small jump to higher values , after which it decreases again . only in the tetragonal phase",
    "the increase with temperature seems to be pressure independent .",
    "comparatively , the jump of the relative volume increase is largest at the high pressure end of the orthorhombic phase .",
    "this behavior is mirrored in the temperature dependence of the @xmath31 lattice parameter at the critical pressures .",
    "we observe that at a pressure of @xmath46  gpa the relative change of @xmath31 when increasing the temperature from @xmath1  k to @xmath26  k and from @xmath47  k to @xmath27  k compared to @xmath48  k to @xmath28  k is considerably larger .",
    "this can be explained by the temperature - induced transition from the tetragonal phase to the orthorhombic phase .",
    "this is also the reason for the relative decrease of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 lattice parameters at @xmath32 gpa .",
    "thus , we obtain a positive slope of the orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition in the temperature - pressure phase diagram of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .     of the unit cell and the lattice parameters @xmath29,@xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 compared to @xmath1 k at different temperatures as a function of external pressure .",
    "the dashed vertical lines indicate the critical pressure that we identified for the corresponding structural transitions at @xmath1  k. note that in particular the first phase transition shifts to higher pressures as the temperature is increased.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally , we set up a temperature pressure phase diagram by specifying the state of the system for each @xmath49 combination we calculated , _",
    "i.e. _ by taking into account if the structure is orthorhombic or tetragonal , the magnetic moments , _ etc . _ to determine the transition pressures used in the diagram we investigated the pressure - derivative of the @xmath50 and @xmath31 lattice parameters and the volume . in the phase diagram",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ res : phasediagram ] ) we distinguished four different regions of structural configurations : the first one is the phase of the purely orthorhombically distorted unit cell , in which all the lattice parameters still continue to decrease monotonically with higher pressure . as we have seen , this phase is present for pressures up to @xmath51  gpa for the temperatures @xmath1  k and 50  k and extends to @xmath46  k for the two higher temperatures .",
    "the second region is an intermediate orthorhombic - tetragonal state , in which the shorter axis @xmath30 of the unit cell is no longer decreasing but increases with higher pressures and has not reached the same length as the longer axis @xmath29 .",
    "this region is quite prominent in our results since the transition is always smoothed out considerably compared to the @xmath14 k result  @xcite .",
    "the next phase is the one of a pure tetragonal unit cell with equal lattice parameters @xmath52 .",
    "after that , at high pressures the collapsed tetragonal phase is dominating , which is defined by the sudden increase in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the decrease in the @xmath31-axis . by comparing the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters at fixed values of the pressure we suspect the t@xmath44ct transition to be pushed to lower pressures at higher temperature , which was found by mittal _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , but due to strong smearing effects we could not determine a slope in the critical pressure .",
    "however , we find the transition to the collapsed tetragonal phase to occur at a pressure being @xmath53  gpa lower compared to experiments .",

    "the tetrahedron - integration method was used for the integration of the brillouin zone and the density was converged with an accuracy of @xmath55 .        as the first configuration we investigated a temperature of @xmath48  k and pressure of @xmath2  gpa , where an orthorhombic unit cell with non - zero magnetic moments is present . at this temperature",
    "the volume is periodically fluctuating around a mean value of @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "the duration for a complete oscillation cycle of the volume is about @xmath59  fs .",
    "we took snapshots of the crystal structure in @xmath36  fs intervals , starting from the maximal expanded volume down to the minimum value of the volume , so in total we covered one half of the oscillation cycle of about @xmath27  fs . for the band structure we use the usual path in * k*-space @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , given in units of the reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "we chose this path since it corresponds to the higher symmetry of the fe lattice rather than to the @xmath7 space group and it can be easily compared to the band structure of the more simple tetragonal laofeas  @xcite .",
    "we compared our results to a zero - temperature bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 structure at @xmath2  gpa from  @xcite to investigate how the finite temperature affects the bands near the fermi level . since the most important contribution to the dos at the fermi level in this materials",
    "is usually given by the fe bands , which we also confirmed to be the case here , we will now discuss the effect of the finite temperature on the fe bands exclusively . for a meaningful comparison one has to mind that in the finite temperature case the positions of the atoms in the unit cell are fluctuating and thus the eight fe atoms are no longer equivalent and the crystal structure is no longer the @xmath7 space group but rather triclinic @xmath65 . due to the higher number of inequivalent fe atoms we also get additional fe bands that are folded back into the brillouin zone . by using the band unfolding method",
    "that was prosed in ref .",
    "@xcite and implemented in fplo  @xcite , we can unfold the band structure and map the equivalent bands onto a single one .        in fig .",
    "[ res : bands_comp ] we show the fe orbital weighted band structure and the @xmath66 fermi surface cut of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 at @xmath48  k and ambient pressure .",
    "the figure shows instantaneous electronic structures for two structural configurations during a complete volume oscillation cycle of the unit cell , separated by a time of @xmath67  fs . the first configuration ( fig .",
    "[ res : bands_comp ]  ( a ) ) corresponds to the maximal volume and the second one ( fig .",
    "[ res : bands_comp ]  ( b ) ) to the minimal volume during the oscillation cycle .",
    "close to the fermi level @xmath68 the most important bands are the fe @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 states .",
    "the unfolding procedure occasionally leads to more crossings of the fermi surface than at @xmath14 because in their thermal motion the fe sites are only approximately equivalent .",
    "fe @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 bands form hole pockets at the @xmath63 point and in addition @xmath72 character is present at the @xmath73 point .",
    "electron pockets at the x ( and y ) points are of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 character .",
    "compared to @xmath14  k calculations , the effect of the finite temperature is clearly present in the shallow inner hole pocket of @xmath69 character at the @xmath63 point , which clearly shows size fluctuations during the trajectory .",
    "shrinking of this hole pocket can be compared to the effect of hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure  @xcite , where the fe @xmath69 band is pushed below the fermi level at the magnetic o@xmath44 t transition .",
    "the structural variations along the md trajectory at @xmath48  k also show interesting effects on the outer hole cylinders at the @xmath63 point . while they appear elliptical along @xmath74 at @xmath75  fs , they appear elliptical along @xmath76 at @xmath67  fs .",
    "this change of shape goes hand in hand with changing importance of @xmath71 and @xmath70 characters : more @xmath71 at @xmath75  fs , more @xmath70 at @xmath67  fs .",
    "this feature resembles the electronic structure changes upon uniaxial compressive and tensile stress in the @xmath13 plane of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( compare ref .  ) .",
    "other bands seem to be less affected by the volume oscillations .",
    "we now proceed from the consideration of transient shapes of the fermi surface to its thermal average .",
    "transient features of the electronic structure are interesting theoretically and can in principle , at least following the excitation of coherent phonons , be observed in experiments with very high temporal resolution  @xcite . since",
    "usual angle resolved photo emission observes time averaged electronic structures , a comparison to the averaged band structures like the ones we show in fig .",
    "[ res : overlay_bs ] might be more appropriate .",
    "note , however , that while our electronic structures include the effect of thermally fluctuating crystal structures , they do not include the thermal broadening of the spectral function which can be described by finite temperature greens functions .",
    "[ res : overlay_bs ] shows the time averaged band structure at @xmath48  k for the pressures @xmath2  gpa , @xmath32  gpa and @xmath42  gpa , where the first one is deep in the orthorhombic phase , the second is in the smooth transition region between orthorhombic and tetragonal phases and the latter is in the tetragonal phase .",
    "our results clearly show that the fe @xmath72 band at the @xmath77 point and the fe @xmath69 band at the @xmath63 and @xmath77 points experience noticeable changes due to thermal structure fluctuations . in the plot",
    "the broadening of the bands is a lot larger than the line width used to draw them , which has implications for interpreting and comparing theoretical iron pnictide band structures and experimentally measured spectral functions .",
    "bands that are below the fermi level in theoretical zero - temperature calculations can become partially occupied even at temperatures way below room temperature like @xmath48  k just because of the structural fluctuations caused by temperature .",
    "this could have implications for the interpretation of angle - resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) results as it leads to an additional broadening in spectral functions , besides the usual thermal broadening .",
    "as the pressure is increased to @xmath32 gpa , which in our case is in the orthorhombic - tetragonal smoothed transition region , we notice a significant shift of bands away from the fermi level as already reported previously  @xcite .",
    "the fe @xmath69 band becomes fully occupied at the @xmath63 point and fluctuates around @xmath68 at the @xmath77 point , whereas the fe @xmath72 band is shifted to higher energies .",
    "the finite fe @xmath69 weight at the fermi level at the @xmath77 point is in contrast to the previous @xmath14 k calculation  @xcite and corresponds to the smooth o@xmath44 t transition .",
    "compared to the @xmath2  gpa result , the temperature induced fluctuations are greatly reduced and only little smearing of the fermi surface is observed .    in the tetragonal phase at @xmath42",
    "gpa the fe bands are pushed further away from the fermi level , with no crossings at the @xmath63 point and only small fe @xmath71 and @xmath70 hole pockets at the @xmath77 point .",
    "thermal smearing of the fermi surface is further reduced .",
    "the effect of the temperature fluctuations in the fe bands is also visible in the density of states ( dos ) . in fig .",
    "[ res : overlay_dos ] we show the fe @xmath78 density of states for the three most important fe @xmath69 , @xmath71 and @xmath70 bands . compared to the zero temperature case we find our previous results for the @xmath48 k calculations to be confirmed also in the dos .",
    "the change of the dos for energies above @xmath68 is rather subtle while below we see a general shift of weight to lower energies or an increase of the dos compared to @xmath14 k. right at the fermi level and slightly below the change is strongest , where the dos is significantly reduced .",
    "this lowering of the density of states at the fermi level @xmath79 is due to a lowering of the symmetry of the system at finite temperature which reduces the energetically unfavourable large @xmath79 ( stoner instability ) .",
    "the thermal fluctuations of the dos are clearly visible with average fluctuations of @xmath80 around the mean value below the fermi level and @xmath81 above .",
    "right at @xmath68 the fluctuations seem to reach a local maximum and can approach large peak values of about @xmath82 , like in the fe @xmath69 orbital at @xmath83 ev . for higher pressures we find the fluctuations to be reduced as expected and do not show them here .",
    "we used density functional theory based born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics to study the behavior of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under external pressure and finite temperature . for low temperatures ,",
    "our results are in agreement with existing experimental as well as other theoretical results , correctly indicating the transition from the orthorhombic magnetic structure to a tetragonal paramagnetic phase around @xmath32 gpa and the tetragonal to a collapsed tetragonal phase around @xmath84 gpa . in general , the transitions were found to be considerably smoothed out due to finite temperature and the critical pressure for the o@xmath44 t transition was shifted to higher pressures , whereas the t@xmath44ct transition becomes almost indiscernible .",
    "these effects became more enhanced with higher temperature and we found a positive slope of the o@xmath44 t transition line in the temperature - pressure phase diagram .",
    "thus , our results confirm that temperature is an important factor for the structural transitions in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "we also investigated the electronic structure of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and the effect of structural fluctuations at finite temperature on the band structure and density of states . at @xmath48  k and @xmath2  gpa we find a fluctuating size of the hole pockets at the @xmath63 and @xmath73 symmetry points .",
    "the fe @xmath69 band shows strong oscillations at @xmath68 with significant variations in the dos , and fe @xmath70 and @xmath71 weights are periodically oscillating at the @xmath63 point due to thermal structural fluctuations . at ambient pressure ,",
    "the fluctuation in the band energies caused by temperature are significant and lead to a thermal broadening of the the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , compared to zero temperature calculations which miss the dynamical fluctuations and overestimate the dos at the fermi level , our results indicate that thermal fluctuations cause non - negligible effects in the electronic structure even at temperatures well below room temperature , which could be important for the interpretation of experiments like angle - resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",

    "<S> we study the temperature and pressure dependence of the structural and electronic properties of the iron pnictide superconductor bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we use density functional theory based born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the system at temperatures from @xmath1  k to 150  k and pressures from @xmath2  gpa to 30  gpa . when increasing the pressure at low temperature , we find the two transitions from an orthorhombic to a tetragonal and to a collapsed tetragonal structure that are also observed in zero temperature structure relaxations and in experiment . however , these transitions are considerably smeared out at finite temperature , whereas the critical pressure for the first transition increases with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the electronic structure of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 at finite temperature and work out differences between the time averaged band structure and fermi surface at finite temperature compared to the known zero temperature results . </S>",
    "<S> our results should be helpful for resolving some open issues in experimental reports for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under high pressure . </S>"
