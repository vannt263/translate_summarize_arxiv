    "the matrices @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the scalar @xmath13 are as follows : matrix @xmath10 is the linear density of the moment of inertia tensor",
    ". matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the elastic properties of the rod ( @xmath14 : young s modulus , @xmath15 and @xmath16 : shear modulus , @xmath17 : torsional rigidity , @xmath18 and @xmath19 : bend stiffness ) . @xmath13 is the linear mass density and is equal to @xmath20 for an isotropic model of dna . the matrices have the following values for an isotropic model of dna :    @xmath21 \\label{intro:6}\\\\ c_{ik}&=&\\left(\\matrix{c_1 & 0 & 0 \\cr   0 & c_2 & 0 \\cr   0 & 0   & c_3 \\cr}\\right)\\equiv   \\left(\\matrix{8.16 & 0 & 0 \\cr   0 & 8.16   & 0 \\cr   0 & 0   & 21.6 \\cr}\\right)\\times10^{-10}\\left[\\frac { km}{s^2}\\right ] \\label{intro:7}\\\\ d_{ik}&=&\\left(\\matrix{d_1 & 0 & 0 \\cr   0 & d_2 & 0 \\cr   0 & 0   & d_3 \\cr}\\right)\\equiv   \\left(\\matrix{2.7 & 0 & 0 \\cr   0 & 2.7   & 0",

    "these definitions will be used below .",
    "the above values have been adapted from @xcite , @xcite .    in biological terminology the components of @xmath7",
    "correspond to the three dna helical parameters describing translation @xmath26 and the components of @xmath6 correspond to the three dna helical parameters describing rotation @xmath27 .",
    "if we attach a local coordinate frame , denoted by @xmath28 , to each base - pair the axes will point in the direction of the major groove , minor groove and along the dna helical axis , respectively .",
    "the shape of the dna can be described by a three - dimensional vector function @xmath29 which is related to @xmath7 and @xmath6 by a suitable mathematical integration .    in elastic rod terminology",
    "the three - dimensional vector function @xmath29 gives the centerline curve of the rod as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , showing only how the rod bends . to show the twist , shear and extension of the rod we must attach `` director '' frames made of the orthogonal triples @xmath28 at regular intervals along the rod .",
    "the director frames are evenly spaced along the rod when the rod is not extended and are all parallel to each other ( with @xmath30 pointing along the rod ) when the rod is not bent or twisted .",
    "any deformation of the rod will be indicated by a corresponding change in the orientation of the director frames .",
    "the vector @xmath9 ( @xmath7 ) is the translational velocity of @xmath31 in time ( space ) : @xmath32 the directors are of constant unit length , so the velocity of each director @xmath8 ( @xmath6 ) is always perpendicular to itself , and it must also be perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the local frame . @xmath33    we will denote @xmath7 of the unstrained state by @xmath34 . in general an unstrained rod can have any shape .",
    "the most simple case is when the rod is straight with unit extension , @xmath35 , because in the unstrained state : @xmath36    similarly , an unstressed elastic rod may have an intrinsic bend and/or twist , denoted by @xmath37 , which must be subtracted from the total @xmath6 to give the dynamically active part .",
    "the simplest case is a rod with no intrinsic bend or twist @xmath38 and @xmath35 .",
    "for short wave lengths ( section [ section:2 ] ) we will suppose that @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in section [ section:3 ] we will consider a straight rod with an intrinsic twist @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the results from this section are valid for any shape in which the curvature of the rod is much greater than the wavelength of the disturbance being propagated regardless of the intrinsic shape of the rod .",
    "let us search as usual for the equilibrium point of the system ( [ intro:1]-[intro:4 ] ) by setting @xmath9 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 to constants .",
    "it is easy to see that an equilibrium point of equations ( [ intro:1]-[intro:4 ] ) is @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46    we shall suppose that each variable differs slightly from the equilibrium value so we retain only the linear terms in the equations .",
    "the linearized system ( [ intro:1]-[intro:4 ] ) is : @xmath47 in the system ( [ linear:1]-[linear:4 ] ) and further in this paper @xmath9 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 denote the small deviations from the equilibrium values , e.g. @xmath48 .    in the usual manner",
    "we search for a solution to ( [ linear:1]-[linear:4 ] ) using harmonic analysis .",
    "we assume that each variable depends on time and space as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes one of the four vector variables from the system of equations ( [ linear:1]-[linear:4 ] ) and @xmath51 denotes its amplitude .",
    "is a scalar quantity corresponding to a frequency of oscillation and that @xmath8 is a vector quantity that describes a rotation , so there should be no confusion between the two variables . ]",
    "let us substitute ( [ linear:4a ] ) to the system ( [ linear:1]-[linear:4 ] ) : @xmath52    for short wavelength we search for solutions with @xmath53 , so in the limit @xmath54 we neglect all terms which contain cross products and the system ( [ linear:4b]-[linear:4e ] ) becomes : @xmath55 here division into longitudinal and transversal components has been obtained by defining @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "equations ( [ linear:4k]-[linear:4n ] ) represent four types of waves that can propagate in the elastic rod with velocity , @xmath58 ( according to the order of equations above ) :    * shear waves ( @xmath59 ) : @xmath60\\over 3.22 \\cdot 10^{-15 } [ k / m]}\\approx 5.03 \\r a / ps\\ ] ] * extension waves ( @xmath61 ) : @xmath62\\over 3.22 \\cdot 10^{-15 } [ k / m]}\\approx 8.2 \\r a / ps\\ ] ] * bend waves ( @xmath63 ) : @xmath64\\over 4.03 \\cdot 10^{-34 } [ km]}\\approx 8.2 \\r a / ps\\ ] ] * twist waves ( @xmath65 ) : @xmath66\\over 2\\cdot 4.03 \\cdot 10^{-34 } [ km]}\\approx 5.0 \\r a / ps\\ ] ]    these results were obtained for a rod with arbitrary shape because all terms that define the rod shape in equations ( [ linear:4b]-[linear:4e ] ) were omitted .",
    "so , if wavelength tends to zero ( is the least space parameter of the problem ) four wave types can propagate along the rod .",
    "it is well known that the measurement of wave velocity is a usual method for determining elastic properties of solids .",
    "so , wave velocity ( transversal and longitudinal ) and young s modulus ( shear modulus ) are uniquely determined by formulae similar to the ( [ linear:4p]-[linear:4s ] ) .",
    "hakim et al . @xcite",
    "have determined the velocity of sound in dna . based on elastic constants obtained from @xcite , @xcite and used in this work ,",
    "the velocity is approximately two times less than that obtained by hakim et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "experiments to measure elastic properties of single dna molecules have been reported using scanning tunnelling microscopy @xcite , fluorescence microscopy @xcite , fluorescence correlation spectroscopy @xcite , optical tweezers @xcite@xcite , bead techniques in magnetic fields @xcite @xcite , optical microfibers @xcite , low energy electron point sources ( electron holography ) @xcite and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) @xcite .",
    "each method differs in the molecular properties probed , spatial and temporal resolution , molecular sensitivity and working environment , so each method gives close but not the same value of elastic constants .",
    "so if we evaluate extension / compression velocity using constants obtained from the data reported in @xcite the result will be two times slower than the value reported here and based on data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate our attention on the case of the straight , twisted rod with no intrinsic bend or shear . in this section",
    "we suppose that @xmath67 and @xmath68 . as we will see this case allows for a complete analytical analysis of extension / compression ( section [ sound ] ) , twist ( section [ twist ] ) , and bend / shear ( section [ coupled ] ) waves of arbitrary wave length",
    ". equations ( [ linear:1]-[linear:4 ] ) in component form are :    @xmath69    it is easy to see that equations ( [ linear:11 ] ) and ( [ linear:17 ] ) ( also ( [ linear:14 ] ) and ( [ linear:20 ] ) ) are independent from all other equations and describe extension ( twist ) waves .",
    "these two wave types will be discussed in the next two sections .      from equations ( [ linear:11 ] ) and ( [ linear:17 ] )",
    "it is easy to obtain two wave equations for the extension / compression waves : @xmath70 these small amplitude waves have velocity ( [ linear:4q ] ) and these equations have an harmonic solution[multiblock footnote omitted ] :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 are arbitrary constants ( wave amplitudes ) and @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "using elastic constants obtained from data in @xcite and @xcite the velocity of sound in dna is equal to @xmath75 ( see equation ( [ linear:4q ] ) ) and dispersion is linear .",
    "this is the velocity of propagation of harmonic waves in dna according to the linear approximation . in the linear approximation",
    "the amplitude of the wave must be small , but it can have any wavelength .      in the same manner equations ( [ linear:14 ] ) and ( [ linear:20 ] ) yield two wave equations which describe twist waves :    @xmath76    linear solutions of these equations can be written as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the arbitrary constants ( wave amplitudes ) and @xmath79 @xmath80 .",

    "this is an homogeneous system of linear equations with unknowns @xmath85 , @xmath59 , @xmath86 and @xmath63 .",
    "solutions other than the trivial solution exist only if the determinant of the coefficients is zero .",
    "this condition is satisfied if : @xmath87    let us discuss the untwisted rod ( @xmath88)-[linear:20 ] ) consists of two independent subsystems .",
    "equations ( [ linear:9 ] , [ linear:13 ] , [ linear:15 ] , [ linear:19 ] ) and ( [ linear:10 ] , [ linear:12 ] , [ linear:16 ] , [ linear:18 ] ) present two different polarizations of bend / shear wave . ] . equation ( [ linear:46 ] ) yields : @xmath89    it will be convenient to use dimensionless variables ( marked by asterisk ) @xmath90 , @xmath91 in this section and define @xmath92 .",
    "equation ( [ linear:47 ] ) becomes(asterisks are omitted ) : @xmath93 with solutions : @xmath94 ^ 2k^2+\\gamma^2_0 } \\pm \\sqrt{[g-1]^2k^2+\\gamma^2_0 } \\right\\}\\ ] ]    there are a total of four solutions .",
    "the @xmath95 sign before the braces merely changes the direction of propagation and will not be discussed further .",
    "the @xmath95 sign between the roots produces two different branches of solutions as presented in fig.[figure:1 ] . the `` upper '' branch .",
    "] corresponds to bend waves and the `` lower '' branch to shear waves .    for a rod of infinite length",
    ", any value of @xmath96 can be chosen that satisfies equation ( [ linear:48 ] ) , but for a rod of finite length there will be an additional constraint that must be satisfied .",
    "if the rod is fixed at both ends then the usual restriction of having a node at each end applies .",
    "this introduces the constraint @xmath97 between the length of the rod , @xmath98 , and the possible wavelengths , @xmath99 , so that only discrete points along either sub - branch in figure 1 will be observed .",
    "the primary results are that , in the linear approximation , four different types of waves can propagate through a uniform elastic rod .",
    "these waves correspond to extension(compression ) , twist , bend and shear .",
    "an extension or twist wave will propagate without exciting other modes or changing shape , and it has a linear dispersion relation .",
    "bend and shear waves behave rather differently and have a nonlinear dispersion relation .",
    "each type obeys a dispersion law that describes two additional sub - branches .    utilizing constants suitable for dna we find that , in the limit of small wavelengths , extension and bend propagate with a velocity of approximately 8 / ps and twist and shear propagate with a velocity of approximately 5 / ps .",
    "is is also significant that the dispersion relation for bend and shear waves is coupled with the inherent twist of dna .",
    "we propose that these physical phenomena enable proteins interacting with dna to accomplish highly sophisticated tasks .",
    "for example the difference in extension and twist velocities can be utilized to measure the distance between two points on the dna .",
    "since the dispersion law for bend and shear waves depends on intrinsic twist , a mechanism for measuring dna topology exists because of the relation between twist , linking number and writhe .",
    "other protein - protein communications can certainly be established to assist cellular mechanisms .",
    "we suggest a molecular dynamics simulation experiment to check the correspondence between the linear theory of the propagation of waves in elastic rods and an all atom simulation of dna . in all - atom",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of dna the number of base pairs that can be simulated for a significant length of time is from tens to less than hundreds of base pairs . for a simulation of dna with fixed ends",
    "it is sufficient to apply a sharp impulse ( @xmath100 function excitation ) to one end of the dna and measure the time of propagation of this disturbance to the other end as a measure of the velocity of extension / compression waves in dna according to equation ( [ linear:4q ] ) .",
    "the propagation of twist can be similarly tested by applying a torque .    to measure dispersion",
    "one must make some simple calculations before the simulation and then excite one end of the dna with a driving force of the appropriate frequency . in this manner",
    "a standing wave can be established in the dna .",
    "the wave frequency and wave number ( @xmath101 ) are related by the well known relation : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the wave frequency , @xmath104 is the wave velocity and @xmath105 is the wavelength . in this case",
    "the wave length ( wave number ) is easy to evaluate : @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the frequency of the driving oscillation .",
    "the values obtained from simulation can be compared with the number obtained from formula ( [ linear:48 ] or [ linear:48 ] ) as a means of correcting our choice of constants .",

    "<S> based on these findings , we propose all - atom numerical simulations of dna to investigate the propagation of these waves as an alternative measure of the wave velocity and dispersion analysis .    * </S>",
    "<S> introduction *    our treatment of dna is based on the hypothesis that such a well organized system as a cell must have a highly sophisticated system of communications . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the cell cycle is the result of a series of complex self organized processes that must be well orchestrated . </S>",
    "<S> a model has been developed to demonstrate how these events may be initiated by critical concentrations of specific proteins which shift equilibrium to favor the advance of the cell cycle@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also known that the cell - cycle can be disrupted if conditions are not suitable . </S>",
    "<S> similar arguments apply to virtually all cellular processes and in order to achieve the required checks and balances a method of communication is necessary .    </S>",
    "<S> is there the possibility that information is transmitted through dna electromagnetically instead of mechanically ? </S>",
    "<S> in such case dna will function as a transmission line which requires total internal reflection ( tir ) of the radiation within the dna . to achieve tir </S>",
    "<S> , the wavelength of the radiation must be 5 - 10 times less than the diameter of the transmission line . </S>",
    "<S> since the diameter of the dna is close to 20 @xmath1 the radiation must have a wavelength close to 2 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this wavelength is close to atomic dimensions so diffraction should dominate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the energy associated with this wavelength radiation is on the order of @xmath2 which is sufficient to destroy chemical bonds and therefore not easily managed biologically . for these reasons </S>",
    "<S> , we believe that the communication will be achieved mechanically .    </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of the paper will demonstrate that the mechanical properties of dna have the necessary time and spatial dimension to support the propagation of information while interactions between proteins and dna provide a mechanism by which this information is processed .    </S>",
    "<S> this manuscript is based on a continuous medium model of dna . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach is well known and widely used to describe solids , liquids and gases ( see , for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when we speak of infinitely small elements of volume , we shall always mean those which are `` physically '' infinitely small , i.e. very small compared with wavelength or radius of curvature under consideration , but large compared with the distance between the atoms in dna . </S>"
