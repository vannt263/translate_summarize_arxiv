    "in a lorentz lattice gas ( llg ) a single particle moves along the bonds of a lattice from lattice site to lattice site . when the particle arrives at a lattice site , it encounters a scatterer that modifies its motion according to a given scattering rule . depending on the scattering rule , each scatterer can also have one of a number of orientations .",
    "moreover , the orientation of each scatterer can be fixed or may change depending on this rule .    in an llg",
    ", the initial orientation of each scatterer is called the llg s initial configuration of scatterers .",
    "the trajectory of a particle in an llg is then determined by the particular choice of ( i ) the lattice , ( ii ) the scattering rule , and ( iii ) the initial configuration of scatters on the lattice . in previous studies ,",
    "a wide variety of dynamics has been observed in such systems , depending on the choice of these three features @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the particle s motion on the regular two - dimensional honeycomb lattice , in which the lattice is either fully occupied by flipping rotators or by flipping mirrors .",
    "a flipping rotator and a flipping mirror have one of two orientations : either _ left _ or _",
    "right_. on the honeycomb lattice , a flipping rotator scatters the particle by rotating its velocity by the angle @xmath3 , either to its left or to its right , depending on whether the rotator is a left or a right rotator , respectively .",
    "similarly , a flipping mirror reflects the particle s velocity over the angle @xmath3 , to its left or right , depending on whether it is a left or a right mirror , respectively . in both cases , the scatterers change or _ flip _ orientation after scattering the particle , from either right to left or from left to right .",
    "the initial configuration we consider , throughout the majority of the paper , is the configuration in which each scatterer is a right rotator . despite the simplicity of this initial configuration , we observe that the particle in this llg has an unusual mode of motion . in this llg",
    "the particle returns to its initial position an infinite number of times where , between these returns , the particle s trajectory is a self - avoiding walk ( see theorem [ thm:1 ] ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time this type of behavior has been observed in an llg .",
    "one of our main objectives in this paper is to describe the underlying mechanism that causes the particle to exhibit this type of motion .",
    "what we find is that the initial configuration of all right rotators has two special properties that lead to this behavior .",
    "the first is that it is an _ admissible _ configuration ( see definition [ def : admiss ] ) , the second is that it is also a _ blocking _ configuration ( see definition [ def : blocking ] ) .",
    "these two new concepts , of an admissible configuration and a blocking configuration , allow us to prove the following general results .",
    "if the particle moves on the honeycomb lattice with an initial configuration that is admissible then , between returns to its initial position , the particle s trajectory is a _ self - avoiding _ walk ( see theorem [ lem:1 ] ) .",
    "if a particle moves on a lattice with an initial configuration that is both an admissible and a blocking configuration , not only does the particle have this self - avoiding property , it also returns to its initial position an infinite number of times ( see theorem [ thm : recurrence ] ) .",
    "this self - avoiding property , which we find in the class of llgs with an admissible configuration , is novel for a number of reasons .",
    "one is that the particle s motion in these systems is completely deterministic , i.e. this motion arises from the particle s deterministic equations of motion .",
    "this is in contrast to the large majority of self - avoiding walks , which are generated via some random process @xcite .",
    "a second reason is that a number of basic mathematical questions regarding self - avoiding walks @xcite are still unresolved .",
    "therefore , the rigorous results presented in this paper are potentially important for gaining a better mathematical understanding of self - avoiding walks . such results also extend the mathematical theory of llgs ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in addition ,",
    "self - avoiding walks are one of the main tools used to model the growth of crystals and polymers @xcite .",
    "these walks also play a central role in the study of the folding and knotting behaviour of biological molecules such as proteins @xcite .",
    "therefore , the class of llgs we consider in this paper is potentially important for the study of these processes .    besides exhibiting this new type of motion ,",
    "these llgs are different from those that have been previously studied , in that they have a single initial configuration . in previous studies",
    ", a typical llg has a large number of initial configurations , which makes it possible to characterize the particle s dynamics in terms of its mean square displacement @xcite . in the llgs we consider , here",
    "this is not possible , because of the irregularity of the particle s mean square displacement .    in order to describe the particle s dynamics in the llgs we consider ,",
    "we introduce the notion of a _ time - averaged mean square displacement _ to the study of these systems .",
    "this concept allows us to describe the particle s dynamics in the llgs we consider in the same way that the mean square displacement is used to describe the particle s dynamics in previous studies .",
    "what we observe , numerically , for those llgs that have a configuration that is both admissible and blocking , is that the particle s time - averaged mean square displacement increases as a power law .",
    "this suggests that the particle in any one of these systems has what we refer to as a _ pulsating _ motion since it regularly returns to its initial position but also appears to have an unbounded trajectory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we describe the flipping rotator and flipping mirror systems we consider throughout the paper , along with their respective equations of motion .",
    "we show that for each flipping rotator system there is a corresponding flipping mirror system with the same dynamics , and vice versa . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we investigate the flipping rotator system , in which all scatterers are initially right rotators . in section [ sec : tamsd ] we introduce the concept of a particle s time - averaged mean square displacement and the idea of a pulsating motion of a particle in an llg .    in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we introduce the class of admissible configurations , that lead to the particle s self - avoiding trajectory , between returns to its initial position . in section [ sec:7 ]",
    "we introduce the class of blocking configurations , and show that configurations that are both admissible and blocking lead the particle to return to its initial position an infinite number of times , i.e. have a pulsating - like behavior . in section [ sec : conc ] we give a number of concluding remarks .",
    "we note that although the main results of this paper are proven mathematically , the paper is written so that it can be understood without the need for the reader to work through the various proofs . to facilitate this ,",
    "each of the paper s mathematical results is preceded by an explanation of the result in words .",

    "in this section we begin by describing the flipping rotator and flipping mirror systems considered in this paper .",
    "we then show that the two types of systems are dynamically equivalent , in the sense that to every flipping rotator system there is a corresponding flipping mirror system with the same dynamics and that the converse of this also holds .",
    "the lattice we consider in this paper is the honeycomb lattice @xmath6 , with sites @xmath7 and bonds @xmath8 .",
    "the lattice consists of regular hexagons , with sides of unit length .",

    "the particle s _ trajectory _ is then the semi - infinite sequence of positions @xmath19 . since the velocity of the particle does not exist at the moment it is scattered , we let @xmath20 denote the velocity of the particle directly after each time @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that there is a scatterer at each lattice site of @xmath10 , so that the lattice is either fully occupied by rotators or mirrors .",

    "when the particle moves along a lattice bond towards a lattice site , the mirror at this site moves to the position nearest to the incoming particle .",
    "once the mirror has reflected the particle it then flips its orientation from either right to left or from left to right .    the way in which the particle is scattered by either a left or right mirror is demonstrated in figure [ fig:2.01 ] ( c ) and ( d ) respectively . in figure [ fig:2.01 ] ( c ) the mirror on the left moves to position 1 since this is the position closest to the particle as it enters from the left .",
