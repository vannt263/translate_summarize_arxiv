    "some of the fundamental properties of nuclear systems may be evidenced through their interaction with an electromagnetic field .",
    "the two components of the field , electric and magnetic , are used to explore the properties of electric and magnetic nature , respectively . at the end of the last century ,",
    "the scissors like states @xcite and the spin - flip excitations @xcite were widely treated by various groups .",
    "the scissors mode provides a description of the angular oscillation of the proton against a neutron system , and the total strength is proportional to the nuclear deformation squared , which reflects the collective character of the excitation @xcite .    by virtue of this feature",
    "it was believed that the magnetic collective properties are in general associated with deformed systems .",
    "this is not true due to the magnetic dipole bands , where the ratio between the moment of inertia and the b(e2 ) value for exciting the first @xmath1 from the ground state @xmath2 , @xmath3 , takes large values , of the order of 100(eb)@xmath4 .",
    "these large values can be explained by there being a large transverse magnetic dipole moment which induces dipole magnetic transitions , but almost no charge quadrupole moment @xcite .",
    "indeed , there are several experimental data sets showing that the dipole bands have large values for @xmath5 , and very small values of @xmath6 ( see for example ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the states are different from the scissors mode ones , exhibiting instead a shears character .",
    "a system with a large transverse magnetic dipole moment may consist of a triaxial core to which a proton prolate orbital and a neutron oblate hole orbital are coupled .",
    "the maximal transverse dipole momentum is achieved when , for example , @xmath7 is oriented along the small axis of the core and @xmath8 along the long axis and the core rotates around the intermediate axis .",
    "suppose that the three orthogonal angular momenta form a right trihedral frame .",
    "if the hamiltonian describing the interacting system of protons , neutrons and the triaxial core is invariant to the transformation which changes the orientation of one of the three angular momenta , i.e. the right trihedral frame is transformed to one of a left type , one says that the system exhibits a chiral symmetry .",
    "as always happens , such a symmetry is identified when it is broken and consequently to the two trihedral ones there correspond distinct energies , otherwise close to each other .",
    "thus , a signature for a chiral symmetry characterizing a triaxial system is the existence of two @xmath9 bands which are close in energies . on increasing the total angular momentum , the gradual alignment of @xmath7 and @xmath8 to the total @xmath10 takes place and a magnetic band is developed .",
    "in @xcite we attempted to investigate another chiral system consisting of one phenomenological core with two components , one for protons and one for neutrons , and two quasiparticles whose angular momentum @xmath11 is oriented along the symmetry axis of the core due to the particle - core interaction . in the quoted reference we proved that states of total angular momentum @xmath12 , where the three components mentioned above carry the angular momenta @xmath13 which are mutually orthogonal , do exist .",
    "such a configuration seems to be optimal for defining a large transverse magnetic moment that induces large m1 transitions . in choosing the candidate nuclei with chiral features",
    ", we were guided by the suggestion @xcite that triaxial nuclei may favor orthogonality of the aforementioned three angular momenta and therefore may exhibit a large transvercse magnetic moment . in the previous publication ,",
    "the formalism was applied to @xmath14pt , which satisfies the triaxiality signature condition .",
    "here the same formalism is applied to two other isotopes , @xmath15os .",
    "moreover the proton and neutrn gyromagnetic factors are calculated in a self - consistent manner .",
    "also , an extended discussion concerning chiral symmetries of the spin - spin interaction , the broken symmetries and associated phase transition is presented .",
    "the core is described by the generalized coherent state model ( gcsm)@xcite which is an extension of the coherent state model ( csm)@xcite for a composite system of protons and neutrons .",
    "the csm is based of the ingredients presented below .    for the sake of giving a self - contained presentation , in what follows we shall give some minimal information about the phenomenological formalism of gcsm , providng a description of the core system . in his way",
    "the necessary notation and the specific properties of the core are presented .",
    "the usual procedure used for describing the excitation energies with a given boson hamiltonian is to diagonalize it and fix the structure coefficients such that some particular energy levels are reproduced . for a given angular momentum ,",
    "the lowest levels belong to the ground , gamma and beta bands , respectively . for example",
    ", the lowest state of angular momentum 2 , i.e. @xmath16 , is a ground band state , the next lowest , @xmath17 , is a gamma band state , while @xmath18 belongs to the @xmath19 band .",
    "the dominant components of the corresponding eigenstates are one , two and three phonon states .",
    "the harmonic limit of the model hamiltonian yields a multi - phonon spectrum while on switching on a deforming anharmonicity , the spectrum is a reunion of rotational bands .",
    "the correspondence of the two kinds of spectra , characterizing the vibrational and rotational regimes respectively , is realized according to the sheline - sakai scheme @xcite . in the near vibrational limit",
    "a certain staggering is observed for the @xmath20 band , while in the rotational extreme , the staggering is different .",
    "the bands are characterized by the quantum number @xmath21 which for the axially symmetric nuclei is 0 for the ground and @xmath22 bands and equal to 2 for @xmath20 band .",
    "the specific property of a band structure consists in the e2 probabilities of transition within a band being much larger that the ones for transitions between two different bands . for @xmath20 stable nuclei ,",
    "the energies of the states heading the @xmath20 and @xmath22 bands are ordered as @xmath23 , while for @xmath20 unstable nuclei the ordering is reversed .",
    "a third class of nuclei exist for which @xmath24 , @xmath25-even .",
    "_ these are the fundamental features for which the wave functions should provide a description in any realistic approach_. the csm builds a restricted basis requiring that the states before and after angular momentum projection are orthogonal and , moreover , accounts for the properties listed above . if such a construction is possible , then one attempts to define an effective hamiltonian which is quasi - diagonal in the selected basis .",
    "the csm is , as a matter of fact , a possible solution in terms of quadrupole bosons @xcite .    unlike within the csm , within the gcsm @xcite quadrupole proton - like bosons , @xmath26 , provide the description of the protons , while quadrupole neutron - like bosons , @xmath27 , provide that of neutrons .",
    "since one deals with two quadrupole bosons instead of one , one expects to have a more flexible model and to find a simpler solution satisfying the restrictions required by csm .",
    "the restricted collective space is defined by the states providing the description of the three major bands : ground , beta and gamma , as well as the band based on the isovector state @xmath28 .",
    "orthogonality conditions , required for both intrinsic and projected states , are satisfied by the following six functions which generate , by angular momentum projection , six rotational bands : @xmath29|0\\rangle .",
    "\\label{figcsm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the following notations have been used : @xmath30 note that a priory we can not select one of the two sets of states @xmath31 and @xmath32 for gamma band , although one is symmetric and the other asymmetric against the proton - neutron permutation .",
    "the same is true for the two dipole states isovector candidates . in @xcite , results obtained by using as alternatives a symmetric structure and an asymmetric structure for the gamma band states were presented .",
    "therein it was shown that the asymmetric structure for the gamma band does not conflict any of the available data .",
    "in contrast , on considering for the gamma states an asymmetric structure and fitting the model hamiltonian coefficients in the manner described in @xcite , for some nuclei a better description for the beta band energies is obtained . moreover , in that situation the description of the e2 transition becomes technically very simple .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite for @xmath33gd are relevant in this respect . for these reasons , here we adopt the option of a proton - neutron asymmetric gamma band .",
    "all calculations performed so far considered equal deformations for protons and neutrons .",
    "the deformation parameter for the composite system is : @xmath34 the factors @xmath35 with @xmath36 involved in the wave functions are normalization constants calculated in terms of some overlap integrals .",
    "we seek now an effective hamiltonian for which the projected states ( [ figcsm ] ) are , at least to a good approximation , eigenstates in the restricted collective space .",
    "the simplest hamiltonian fulfilling this condition is : @xmath37 with @xmath38 denoting the proton and neutron total angular momentum .",
    "the hamiltonian given by eq.([hgcsm ] ) has only one off - diagonal matrix element in the basis ( [ figcsm ] ) ; that is @xmath39 .",
    "however , our calculations show that this affects the energies of @xmath22 and @xmath40 bands at the level of a few kev .",
    "therefore , the excitation energies of the six bands are to a good approximation , given by the diagonal elements : @xmath41 f spin properties of the model hamiltonian and analytical behavior of energies and wave functions in the extreme limits of vibrational and rotational regimes have been studied @xcite .",
    "results for the asymptotic regime of deformation suggests that the proposed model generalizes both the two - rotor @xcite and the two - drop models @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath42 is invariant under any p - n permutation and therefore its eigenfunctions have a definite parity .",
    "we chose one or the other parity for the gamma band , depending on the quality of the overall agreement with the data .",
    "we do nt exclude the situation when the fitting procedure selects the symmetric @xmath43 band as the optimal one .",
    "the possibility of having two distinct phases for the collective motion in the gamma band has been considered also in @xcite within a different formalism .",
    "the particle - core interacting system is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath44 with the following notation for the particle quadrupole operator : @xmath45 the core is described by @xmath42 , while the particle system is described by the next two terms , standing for a spherical shell model mean field and pairing interactions of the like nucleons , respectively .",
    "the notation @xmath46 is used for the spherical shell model states .",
    "the last two terms , denoted hereafter as @xmath47 , express the interaction between the satellite particles and the core through a quadrupole - quadrupole @xmath48 and a spin - spin force @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the angular momenta carried by the core and particles are denoted by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .    the mean field plus",
    "the pairing term is quasi - diagonalized by means of the bogoliubov - valatin transformation .",
    "the free quasiparticle term is @xmath52 , while the qq interaction preserves the above mentioned form , with the factor @xmath53 changed to : @xmath54 the notation @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is used for the quasiparticle creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "we restrict the single particle space to a proton single - j state where two particles are placed . for the space of the particle - core states ,",
    "therefore , we consider the basis defined by : @xmath57_{im } , \\label{basis}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 denotes the quasiparticle vacuum , while @xmath59 is the norm of the projected state .",
    "[ level4 ] the formalism described above was applied for two isotopes @xmath15os . in choosing these isotopes , we had in mind their triaxial shape behavior reflected by the signature @xmath60 indeed , this equation is obeyed with a deviation of 2 kev for @xmath61os and 11 kev for @xmath62os .",
    "we calculated first the excitation energies for the bands described by the angular momentum projected functions @xmath63 and the particle - core hamiltonian @xmath64 .",
    "several parameters , like the structure coefficients defining the model hamiltonian and the deformation parameters @xmath65 , are to be fixed . for a given @xmath65 we determined the parameters involved in @xmath42 by fitting the excitation energies in the ground , @xmath22 and @xmath20 bands , through a least square procedure .",
    "we then varied @xmath65 and kept the value which provides the minimal root mean square of the resulting deviations from the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the excitation energies of the phenomenological magnetic bands are free of any adjusting parameters . in fixing the strengths of the pairing and the @xmath66 interactions , we were guided by @xcite , where spectra of some pt even - even isotopes where interpreted with a particle - core hamiltonian , the core being described usung the csm .",
    "the two - quasiparticle energy for the proton orbital @xmath67 was taken as 1.947 mev for @xmath61os and 2.110 mev for @xmath62os , these values being close to the ones yielded by a bcs treatment in the extended space of single particle states .",
    "the parameters mentioned above have the values listed in table i.    excitation energies calculated with these parameters are compared with the corresponding experimental data , in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "one notes a good agreement of results with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , there is no data values available concerning the magnetic states .",
    "however , in @xcite the 1304.82 kev and 1115.5 kev states in @xmath61os and @xmath62os respectively , perform an m1 decay to the ground band states .",
    "these states could tentatively be associated with the heading states of the two dipole bands which are located at 1400 and 1538 kev , respectively . for @xmath61os ,",
    "the states @xmath68 are not in a natural order from @xmath69 . indeed , the yrast states belong to the @xmath28 band except the states with @xmath70 which are of @xmath71 type .",
    "similarly , non - yrast states have a @xmath71 character except the states of @xmath70 , which are of @xmath28 type .",
    ".excitation energies of the chiral bands @xmath72 given in units of mev [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "if in the expression of h ( [ modelh ] ) one ignores the spin - spin term , the resulting hamiltonian exhibits a chiral symmetry .",
    "a chiral transformation in the angular momentum space consists in changing the orientation of one of the axes .",
    "thus the chiral transformation transforms a right oriented trihedral form into a left oriented trihedral form and vice versa .",
    "clearly the spin - spin interaction breaks the chiral symmetry i.e. this term is not invariant under any chiral transformation . indeed , changing alternatively the signs of @xmath73 one obtains three distinct interactions which , moreover , are different from the initial one . associating with each of these interactions",
    "a band ( for more details see section 5 ) , one obtains a set of four bands which will be conventionally called chiral bands . in figures 3 and 4 the chiral bands @xmath74 and @xmath75 are associated with the actual hamiltonian given by equation ( [ modelh ] ) and the one obtained by the chiral transformation @xmath76 , respectively , while the bands @xmath77 and @xmath78 are degenerate and correspond to the transformations @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively , applied to the initial reference frame symbolized by @xmath74 .",
    "the degeneracy is caused by the fact that in both cases the transformed spin - spin interaction is asymmetric with respect to the p - n permutation and therefore their averages with the two quasiparticle - dipole - core states , which are asymmetric , are vanishing .",
    "it is remarkable the fact that upon enlarging the particle - core space with the @xmath81_{im}$ ] states , the interaction between the opposite parity @xmath82 states , due to the spin - spin term , would determine another two bands of mixed symmetry , characterized also by large m1 rates .",
    "the description of such bands will be presented elsewhere . in conclusion ,",
    "the degeneracy mentioned above is removed if the space is enlarged such that the parity mixing symmetries are possible .",
    "the energies shown in figures 3 and 4 are listed in table 2 .      in what follows",
    "we give a few details about the calculation of the m1 transition rate .",
    "the magnetic dipole transition operator is defined as : @xmath83 considering for the core s magnetic moment the classical definition , one obtains an analytical expression involving the quadrupole coordinates and their time derivatives of first order , which can be further calculated by means of the heisenberg equation @xcite . finally , writing the result in terms of quadrupole boson operators and identifying the factors multiplying the proton and neutron angular momenta with the gyromagnetic factors of proton and neutrons , one obtains @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the nuclear charge and radius , while @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the proton mass and the velocity of light .",
    "@xmath89 is a parameter defining the canonical transformation relating the coordinate and conjugate momenta with the quadrupole bosons , while @xmath90 are the structure coefficients involved in @xmath42 . within the gcsm",
    "the core gyromagnetic factor is @xcite @xmath91 and moreover that might be identified with the liquid drop value , @xmath92 ; consequently the canonicity coefficient acquires the expression : @xmath93 inserting this in eq.([gpgn ] ) , the gyromagnetic factors are readily obtained .",
    "their values are listed in table 1 .",
    "the fermion gyromagnetic factor corresponds to the proton orbital h@xmath94 with the spin composing term quenched by a factor 0.75 .    with this expression for the transition operator , we also calculated the b(m1 ) value for the transitions @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the results are 0.2772@xmath97 , 0.0139 @xmath97 for @xmath61os and 0.1752@xmath97 , 0.0085@xmath97 for @xmath62os .",
    "actually this is consistent with the fact that the nuclear deformations of the considered nuclei are small , which results in there being a relatively small m1 strength for the dipole state @xmath28 .     with i=1,2,3,4 , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the model used in the present paper",
    "was formulated in a previous publication @xcite and applied for the case of @xmath14pt . as we already mentioned before , here we used the same ingredients but for another two triaxial isotopes , @xmath98 .",
    "while in ref.@xcite the gyromagnetic factor of neutrons was taken to be @xmath99 , here the two factors are calculated in a self - consistent manner and thus they depend explicitly on the structure coefficients involved in the collective hamiltonian .",
    "our work proves that the mechanism for chiral symmetry breaking , which also favors a large transverse component for the dipole magnetic transition operator @xcite , is not unique .",
    "the bands @xmath100 and @xmath101 , defined above have , do indeed have properties which are specific to the chiral bands :    \\i ) first of all , as proved in @xcite , the trihedral form @xmath102 is orthogonal for some total angular momenta of the 2qp - core states , at the beginning of the bands , and almost orthogonal for the next states , and on increasing the total angular momentum the angle is decreased due to the alignment effect caused by rotation .",
    "since the proton state involved is @xmath67 and the fermion angular momentum is @xmath103 with the projection @xmath104 , this is aligned to the oz axis , which is perpendicular onto the plane of the orthogonal vectors @xmath105 and",
    "@xmath106 ;    \\ii ) the energy spacings in the two bands have similar behaviors as function of the total angular momentum .",
    "they vary slowly with angular momentum . from table 2 one",
    "notes that for @xmath62os the energy spacing increases with the angular momentum faster than in the case of @xmath61os .",
    "the reason for this difference is provided by the strength of the qq - interaction ;    \\iii ) the staggering function @xmath107 is almost constant ;    \\iv ) the most significant property is that the b(m1 ) values for the transition between two consecutive levels are large .",
    "the b(m1 ) values associated to the intra - band transitions are large despite the fact that the deformation is typical for a transitional spherically deformed region ; this property is shown in fig .",
    "the fact that the large transition matrix elements are associated with a chiral configuration of the angular momenta involved is illustrated in fig 6 , where one sees that large b(m1 ) values are achieved for large quasiparticle total angular momentum projection on the symmetry axis . according to figure 5",
    ", the m1 strength for the intra - band transitions depends quadratically on the angular momentum of the decaying state .",
    "this feature is to be compared with the property of the scissors mode that the the total m1 strength is proportional to the nuclear deformation squared .",
    "[ level5 ] our description is different from the ones from the literature in the following respects .",
    "the previous formalisms were focussed mainly on the odd - odd nuclei , although a few publications refer also to even - odd @xcite and even - even isotopes @xcite .",
    "our approach concerns the even - even systems and is based on a new concept . while until now there have been only two magnetic bands related by a chiral transformation , here we found four magnetic bands with this property , two of them being degenerate .",
    "indeed , consider the trihedral formas @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 denoted by the same letters as the associated bands , i.e. @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . to these trihedral forms , four distinct spin - spin",
    "interaction terms correspond : @xmath112 , each of them affecting the chiral symmetric and degenerate spectrum in a specific way .",
    "concretely , let us denote by @xmath113 with @xmath114 the chiral transformation corresponding to the `` k '' axis and define @xmath115 the average of the model hamiltonian with the transformed functions is @xmath116 this equation proves that the four bands are , indeed , determined by the images of the non - invariant part of h through the transformation @xmath113 . according to this equation , the four chiral bands show up upon adding to the space of 2qp - core states given by equation ( 3.4 ) the corresponding chirally transformed states .    obviously , the four bands are related by the following equations : @xmath117 with @xmath118 , k = p , n , f , denoting the rotation in the angular momenta space around the axis @xmath119 with angle @xmath120 . therefore",
    ", if @xmath74 is a right trihedral form then the trihedral forms @xmath121 and @xmath78 have a left character . due to this , one may expect that the bands @xmath122 with k=2,3,4 , are identical since they have the same chiral nature .",
    "this is however not true in our model since the transformations @xmath123 and @xmath124 break not only the chiral symmetry but also the proton - neutron ( pn ) permutation symmetry . due to this feature",
    "the bands @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath75 are different . moreover , since for the frames @xmath77 and @xmath125 the ss term is asymmetric under the ( pn ) permutation and consequently its average with wave functions of definite pn parity is vanishing , the corresponding bands are degenerate .",
    "note that upon enlarging the particle - core space with the @xmath126 states , the interaction between the opposite parity @xmath82 states due to the spin - spin term will determine another two bands of mixed symmetry , characterized also by large m1 rates . in conclusion ,",
    "the degeneracy mentioned above is removed if the space is enlarged such that the parity mixing is possible .",
    "the description of such bands will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the bands of different chiral kinds are conventionally called partner bands . in this respect ,",
    "the pairs of bands @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 are chiral partner bands .",
    "according to the above equations , the reference frames of similar chiral nature are related by a rotation of angle equal to @xmath120 .",
    "now let us see how the transformations defined above affect the ss interaction term . to this end , it is useful to introduce the notation @xmath130 for the interactions specified in figure [ chiralframes ] which corresponds to the reference frame @xmath122 . obviously , the following relations hold : @xmath131 from here , the connections of different chiral transformations result : @xmath132 consequently , under the given conditions the set of @xmath133 and the unity transformation @xmath134 form a group . at a superficial glance",
    ", this seems to be in conflict with the fact that a chiral transformation changes chirality while the product of two transformations preserves chirality .",
    "we mention however that the equations from above were derived taking into account that each interaction @xmath130 is invariant under the parity transformation @xmath135 , which simultaneously changes the orientation of the three axes . due to this result",
    "we may extend the notion of the chiral partner bands to any pair of bands @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "the bands @xmath74 and @xmath75 have different chiralities and thereby they characterize different nuclear phases . varying the interaction strength @xmath139 smoothly from positive to negative values , one may achieve a transition between the two phases .",
    "the critical value of the strength is @xmath140 recall that the degenerate bands @xmath77 and @xmath78 correspond to this value . on the other hand it has been proved that , generally , the critical point of a phase transition corresponds to a new symmetry @xcite .",
    "tentatively , the degeneracy of the @xmath77 and @xmath141 bands might be related with the symmetry corresponding to the critical spin - spin interaction .",
    "note that in the absence of the ss interaction , the hamiltonian is invariant under chiral transformations , and therefore states with left are degenerate with those of right chirality .",
    "the model hamiltonian is also invariant with respect to the pn permutation and consequently its eigenstates are either even or odd with respect to this symmetry . when the ss interaction is switched on both symmetries - chiral and pn permutation -",
    "are broken .",
    "thus the energies of left oriented frame are different of those of right character . moreover , for @xmath74 and @xmath75 the states are of definite pn permutation parity , while upon enlarging the model space , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are split apart and the states become mixture of components of different parities .",
    "note that fixing the angular momentum orientation may define a certain intrinsic frame while apparently the hamiltonian is considered in the laboratory frame , due to its scalar character .",
    "this is actually not the case .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian is invariant under the rotations defined by the components of the total angular momentum but not under those defined by the components of @xmath142 , @xmath143 or @xmath144 .",
    "the pure boson term should be discussed in the framework of the coherent states .",
    "indeed , we recall that the projected states depend on the deformation parameter which implies an asymmetric structure in the intrinsic coordinates .",
    "indeed the projected state is a linear combination of different k components among which one is dominant .",
    "therefore the states are approximatively k oriented and by this the hamiltonian is considered in a subsidiary intrinsic frame when an angular momentum projected states are used .    usually the particle - core formalisms are confronted with the pauli principle violation .",
    "this feature is not encoutered in the present approach .",
    "indeed , the two quasiparticles which are coupled to the core have a maximal angular momentum . on the other hand in a spurious component , which might be generated by the particle number operator , the quasiparticle angular momenta are anti - aligned which results in having a vanishing total angular momentum .",
    "we recall the fact that the core is described in terms of phenomenological quadrupole proton and neutron bosons . if we consider a microscopic structure for the aforementioned bosons , then among the composing quadrupole configurations one may find the state of the outer particles .",
    "this could be a source for the pauli principle violation .",
    "again that does not matter in our case since the 2qp state have a maximal angular momentum while the proton bosons , describing the core , have the angular momentum equal to two . in conclusion , due to the fact that the 2qp states , which are coupled to the core , are characterized by maximal quantum number k , the pauli principle is not violated at all , at least as far as the particle - core interaction is concerned . of course",
    ", since the states of the core are multi - boson states the pauli principle is violated , which is common to all phenomenological descriptions dealing with bosons . however ,",
    "if the anharmonic boson hamiltonian is derived by means of the marumori @xcite boson expansion method , this drawback is certainly removed .",
    "since our description uses phenomenological quadrupole bosons , the core s feature mentioned above does not show up .    in order to stress on the novel features introduced by the present paper ,",
    "it is worth summarizing the differences with respect to the approach of @xcite :    \\a ) the nuclei chosen for applications are different ;    \\b ) the m1 properties are studied with different transition operators ;    \\c ) here we discuss the phase transition between left and right chiral nuclear phases ;    \\d ) the critical point of this transition is characterized by a new symmetry associated with the two degenerate bands @xmath77 and",
    "@xmath78 ;    \\e ) on enlarging the 2qp - core space by adding states of even parity with respect to the proton - neutron permutation , as for example the states @xmath126 , and then diagonalizing the spin - spin interactions @xmath145 and @xmath146 in the extended space , the degeneracy of the two bands @xmath77 and @xmath78 is lifted . moreover , with the interactions @xmath147 and @xmath148 one associates two bands of mixed parity and left chirality .",
    "the composing states have the 2qp - dipole core functions as dominant components .",
    "the resulting non - degenerate bands have mixed parity and left chiralities and define new @xmath77 and @xmath78 bands , denoted hereafter by @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the band @xmath149 is composed of states having the maximum component for the 2qp - dipole core state yielded by diagonalizing @xmath147 .",
    "similarly one defines the band @xmath150 but with the ss interaction @xmath148 .",
    "note that while @xmath151 and @xmath152 bands have strong intra - band m1 transitions the other two bands provided by diagonalization , denoted by @xmath153 and @xmath154 , are connected with @xmath151 and @xmath152 respectively , by weak inter - band m1 transitions .",
    "the angular momentum alignment is a slow process and therefore the angle between @xmath105 and @xmath106 remains large , which contrasts the scissors mode which is characterized by small angle between the symmetry axes of the proton and neutron systems . from this point of view",
    "the chiral states are of shears type rather than of scissors type .",
    "the intra - band m1 strength depends quadratically on the angular momentum , while the m1 strength for a scissors mode is proportional to the nuclear deformation squared .",
    "here we considered two proton quasiparticle bands but alternatively we could chose two neutron quasiparticles or one proton plus one neutron quasiparticle bands .",
    "of course , the latter bands would give a description of an odd - odd system .",
    "we already checked that a two neutron quasiparticle band is characterized by a non - collective m1 transition rate .",
    "this feature suggests that , indeed , the orbital magnetic moment carried by protons plays an important role in determining a chiral magnetic band .",
    "the core is described through angular momentum projected states from a proton and neutron coherent state as well as from its lowest order polynomial excitations . among the three chiral angular momentum components two",
    "are associated with the core and one with a two quasiparticle state . in contradistinction ,",
    "the previous descriptions devoted to odd - odd system , use a different picture .",
    "the core carries one angular momentum and , moreover , its shape structure determines the orientation of the other two angular momenta associated with the odd proton and odd neutron , respectively . for odd - odd nuclei",
    "several groups identified twin bands in medium mass regions @xcite and even for heavy mass regions@xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches are based mainly on a triaxial rotor - two quasiparticle coupling , which was earlier formulated and widely used by the group of faessler @xcite . for a certain value of the total angular momentum ,",
    "the angular momenta carried by the three components are mutually orthogonal .",
    "this picture persists for the next two angular momenta and then increasing the the rotation frequency , the core spins are gradually aligned .",
    "subsequently , the quasiparticle angular momentum is also aligned with the resulting spin .",
    "this is the mechanism which develops a @xmath155=1 band .",
    "the new features of the present approach are underlined by comparing it with the formalism of @xcite .    as mentioned before , the even - even nuclei which might be good candidates for use in exploring the chiral properties are those of a triaxial shape",
    ". moreover , the satellite protons are to be in a shell of large angular momentum . in this way",
    "the protons orbital angular momentum provides a consistent contribution to the m1 strength .",
    "also , the chosen nucleus must belong to a transitional spherically deformed region , i.e. it exhibits a small nuclear deformation . in the present approach the chiral states are of 2qp - core dipole state type which implies that the core has a low lying dipole band .",
    "the numerical results for the chosen nuclei are consistent with the commonly accepted signatures of the chiral bands .",
    "the intra - band m1 strength has a quadratic dependence on the state angular momentum , which contrasts the case for the scissors mode , whose strength is proportional to the nuclear deformation squared .",
    "the chiral bands are characterized by large angles between the proton and neutron symmetry axes , while for the scissor mode this angle is very small .",
    "the calculated m1 strength for the transition from a chiral band to the band generated by the @xmath126 is small , which confirms the fact that the considered states have a different nature than the scissors - like states .",
    "the strength parameters characterizing the core were fixed by fitting some energies from ground , @xmath22 and @xmath20 bands .",
    "the agreement with experimental data in the core bands is very good .",
    "unfortunately , no data for the dipole bands are available for the chosen nuclei .",
    "experimental data for chiral bands in even - even nuclei are desirable",
    ". these would encourage us to extend the present description to a systematic study of the chiral features in even - even nuclei .",
    "the present paper has the merit of drawing the attention to the fact that such states , organized in twin bands , exist .",
    "we believe that predicting new features of the nuclear system and describing the existing data are equally important ways of achieving progress in the field .",
