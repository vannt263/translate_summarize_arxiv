    ", one gets a different non - vanishing non - singular result after the cancellation of the infrared singularities .",
    "moreover , sometimes the non - singular result may even be gauge dependent ; see , for example , @xcite . since the predictions of observables should be unambiguous , clearly",
    "some improvement of the formalism is necessary .",
    "recall that actually any well - defined physical quantity should have _ no _ infrared ( ir ) singularities .",
    "an ir singularity in a particular diagram will therefore +  _ either _ be cancelled by the contribution of another diagram , +  _ or _ be avoided by the cancellation between real soft gluon / photon emission and the virtual loop correction ( of the same order in @xmath5-coupling ) to the main hard process , +  _ or _ not occur due to a physical cutoff of the large - distance divergency caused by the kinematics corresponding to a particular experiment .",
    "we list a few examples :    * the well - known bloch - nordsieck  @xcite cancellation between the real emission of a soft photon which can not be observed experimentally and the loop correction ( the sudakov form factor ) to the main process without extra soft photon emission .",
    "after the cancellation , the physical infrared cutoff is fixed by the experimental resolution , that is by the energy of photons which _ can _ be observed in the particular experiment . * an analogous cancellation between the low-@xmath6 gluon emission ( @xmath7 ) in bfkl evolution and gluon reggeization ) power term in the bfkl amplitude can be generated either by the emission of a new @xmath8-channel gluon or it may come from the @xmath9 decomposition of the @xmath10-channel gluon regge trajectory . in the latter case the ir logarithmic divergency is hidden in the expression for the gluon trajectory and corresponds to the integration over the @xmath10-channel gluon virtuality in the loop which describes gluon reggeization . at first sight , these two expressions seem to have nothing to do with each other .",
    "however , by changing the variable and using an identity between two integrals , it was shown that the regge trajectory contribution may be written in a form which provides an exact cancellation of the @xmath11 singularity caused by the new low-@xmath6 gluon emission  @xcite .",
    "thus , finally the bfkl kernel has no ir divergency . ] . * the cross section of high energy quark - quark scattering caused by the two - gluon exchange ( the low - nussinov pomeron @xcite ) has a divergency of the form @xmath12 .",
    "this is eliminated for real colourless hadron scattering by accounting for the interaction with quark spectators . * the logarithmic divergency in the nlo photon - gluon fusion dis coefficient function",
    "is cancelled by subtracting the contribution already generated at lo by the convolution of the lo gluon - to - quark ( @xmath13 ) splitting function and the lo coefficient function  @xcite .",
    "the subtraction is necessary to avoid double counting .",
    "thus each time we face an ir singularity we must either find how it is cancelled or find the true , physically - motivated , infrared cutoff .",
    "the result can not be ambiguous or depend on one or another _ prescription_. the dimensional ( @xmath14 ) regularization used to eliminate the divergency in the ultraviolet region should not affect the ir domain since after we trace all the ir cancellations and physically - motivated cutoffs there can be no place for an ir contribution coming from very large distances .    here",
    "we study the role of the ir ( large - distance ) domain during parton evolution .",
    "as we have argued above , this should cause no problem ; there should be no ir divergency and we should obtain a unique prediction for any well - defined observable . unfortunately the conventional prescription used for dglap parton evolution at nlo contains a non - zero contribution of ir ( @xmath15 ) origin which makes no physical sense . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we show that this contribution comes from an incorrect treatment of the subtraction of the term already generated by the two steps of the lo evolution from the diagrams corresponding to the nlo splitting .",
    "then in section [ sec : alt ] we discuss whether or not the difference between the conventional @xmath16 and ` physical ' prescriptions may be considered as an ` alternative factorization scheme ' . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we explain the problem with the ` conventional ' treatment in more detail , and show how it can be avoided by using a ` physical ' approach . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we perform the calculations for qed evolution . for qed",
    "there is no confinement and all the quantities are well - defined in terms of the electron and photon ( regarded as partons ) .",
    "however , the extension to qcd is straightforward .",
    "the problem appears for the first time at the nlo level . for lo",
    "dglap evolution we have strong @xmath6 ordering , and so starting from some non - zero virtuality @xmath17 we never enter the infrared domain .",

    "this two - loop ladder diagram generates the @xmath18 contribution depending on whether we are studying qed or qcd . ] which consists of both the nlo part and a part generated by two - step lo evolution . therefore to extract the nlo result we must subtract this lo@xmath19lo contribution . here",

    ", height=377 ]      first , we consider the conventional dimensional regularisation approach , with the corresponding lo@xmath19lo subtraction shown by diagram ( b ) .",
    "we follow the original paper for ( non - singlet ) nlo evolution by curci , furmanski and petronzio @xcite . the central dot in the lo@xmath19lo diagram ( b )",
    "represents a projector p_np_p_n , [ eq : pen ] in momentum and spinor space , which ensures that both evolution steps in the diagram are at lo .",
    "the projector puts the intermediate parton on - mass - shell ( @xmath20 ) and keeps only the @xmath21 singular part of the lower cell , and only that spin structure which will produce the @xmath21 pole in the next cell .",
    "however , there is a danger that some of the @xmath15 finite terms of ir origin which are present in diagram ( a ) , are killed by the projector acting in diagram ( b ) .",
    "the crucial question is how to treat these @xmath15 terms .    usually one does not need to worry about the ir @xmath15 contribution coming from an individual diagram , since it is known that finally there is no ir divergency and",
    "so it is natural to expect that all the large - distance contributions will be cancelled .",
    "however , to provide an exact cancellation all terms should be calculated under the same conditions .",
    "for example if at lo level we have some additional boundary condition like @xmath22 , then the same condition should be applied to the nlo diagram .",
    "recall that the only ir divergency at nlo level comes from the box ( and self - energy ) diagrams ( in the axial gauge used to provide the usual partonic interpretation ) .",
    "the divergency is identical to that accounted for in lo evolution .",
    "the divergency has a logarithmic @xmath23 form and comes from the region @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , in this domain the contribution of the two - loop ladder diagram is exactly equal , up to non - singular @xmath25 corrections , to that generated by the two - step lo evolution , fig .",
    "[ fig : qedfig1](c ) .",
    "thus , after the subtraction of this lo@xmath19lo term , the remaining nlo part ( that is the nlo splitting function ) should not contain any large - distance contributions .",
    "so a sensible _ physical _ way of proceeding , is to subtract the lo - generated contribution ( diagram ( c ) ) from the ladder - like feynman graph ( diagram ( a ) ) before the integration .",
    "that is , work directly in terms of diagrams . since",
    ", for @xmath26 , the contribution of the nlo graph is exactly equal ( up to @xmath27 terms ) to that generated by the lo diagrams , the infrared singularity is cancelled ; and so the remaining part may be integrated in normal 4-dimensional space .",
    "note that , in lo evolution , we evolve upwards starting from some fixed virtuality @xmath28 , and due to strong @xmath6-ordering we never enter the region below @xmath29 . on the other hand , the original two - loop diagram samples this region .",
    "so we have a potential inconsistency . if all low scale ( @xmath30 ) effects are represented by the phenomenological starting distributions for the evolution , we have _ either _ to eliminate the contribution of low @xmath31 from the two - loop ladder diagram ( that is , completely exclude the ir contribution ) , _ or _ to subtract the lo - generated part in its original exact form ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qedfig1](c ) ) without any additional limits or distortions caused by the projector .",
    "we will follow the second approach . as was argued above ,",
    "such a subtraction completely eliminates the ir contribution from the two - loop diagram , leading to a final result which does not contain finite @xmath15 terms of ir origin . since after the lo@xmath19lo subtraction",
    ", the nlo part has no ir divergency terms . ]",
    ", the result can be calculated directly in normal @xmath32 dimensional space .",
    "we call this the ` physical ' approach .      unlike the ` physical ' approach , in ` conventional ' dimensional regularisation we work in @xmath33 dimensions . here",
    ", the lo@xmath19lo subtraction generated by the lo evolution is distorted by the projection operator , @xmath34 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : qedfig1](b ) .",
    "this projector simplifies the calculation of the leading @xmath21 pole contributions , but does not provide an exact cancellation of the ir part , leaving some unphysical finite @xmath15 terms .",
    "however , to provide an exact cancellation of the unphysical large - distance contributions we must subtract these non - singular terms as well .    we have checked that if we would have kept the correct @xmath15 terms in the lo@xmath19lo subtraction in the dimensional regularisation approach , then we would have reproduced the result obtained in the ` physical ' 4-dimensional approach , for the nlo coefficient functions for deep - inelastic and drell - yan processes @xcite .",
    "below we denote this discrepancy in the nlo coefficient functions by @xmath35 .    in summary , the subtraction based on feynman diagrams completely cancels the infrared divergency , so there is no need to use infrared regularisation . as a consequence ,",
    "there are no sources of infrared ambiguity .",
    "we emphasize that this ` physical ' prescription differs from the ` conventional ' @xmath36 approach by the non - neglect of the contribution of the @xmath15 terms .",
    "let us start with discrepancy @xmath35 which originates from the @xmath37 infrared contribution to the non - singlet coefficient function , @xmath38 , in qed .",
    "we have checked , by explicit calculation , that the function @xmath39 where the ` + ' prescription is implied .",
    "it originates from the @xmath40 terms in the lo splitting function p(x,)=p^lo(x)+_p(x )  , where @xmath41 is the part of the lo splitting function , proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "explicitly , it is given by  @xcite @xmath43 the first term comes from the extra photon polarisation states in @xmath14 space .",
    "the second term arises from the phase space factor @xmath44 , which , when expressed in terms of virtuality variables , takes the form @xmath45 the third term in ( [ eq:3terms ] ) , involving @xmath46 , arises from the self - energy diagram .",
    "it is necessary to keep this term to satisfy the charge / flavour conservation law @xmath47 .",
    "thus expression ( [ eq : dc ] ) , which represents the difference between ` conventional ' and ` physical ' treatments of the ir region for the ( non - singlet ) nlo coefficient function , is just the convolution of the lo coefficient function , @xmath48 , with the part , @xmath41 , of the lo splitting function that is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "we note that the correction to the nlo coefficient function , @xmath35 , may be absorbed by redefining the parton distribution @xmath49 that is , at first sight the @xmath35 effect may be considered as an ` alternative factorization scheme ' .",

    "thus provided that the analogous contribution to the splitting function @xmath53 is equal to commutator @xmath54~\\equiv~\\delta c\\otimes p - p\\otimes \\delta c~ \\ ] ] we will have the correct non - singlet nlo evolution .",
    "however , since this commutator vanishes we must have @xmath55 for non - singlet evolution in the new factorization scheme . if , on the contrary , we find a non - zero difference @xmath56 between the splitting functions calculated within the ` physical ' and the ` conventional ' approaches , it would mean that the correct ` physical ' treatment of the ir domain _ can not _ be considered as the ` conventional ' treatment in an alternative factorization scheme .",
    "so , clearly , we have to study the difference @xmath56 .",
    "to investigate @xmath56 we consider non - singlet nlo evolution in well - defined qed theory ; that is we compare the cross section for @xmath57 calculated using first the ` conventional ' treatment and then the ` physical ' treatment of the ir region . for such evaluations we need to calculate both the nlo splitting function and the nlo non - singlet coefficient function .",

[ eq : dp ] the function @xmath146 exactly coincides with the difference between the real two - photon emission calculated conventionally , with the lo@xmath19lo term subtracted ( 4th column of table 1 in @xcite ) , and that calculated in @xmath32 dimensions using the ` physical ' approach .    recall that this is the difference for real two - photon emission , whereas in the lo@xmath19lo subtraction we need to account for the whole lo contribution , which can be written as the real emission regularised by the + prescription , see ( [ eq : i0 ] ) and ( [ eq : i1 ] ) . in other words , we have to omit the @xmath64 contribution in ( [ eq : dp ] ) , which is actually cancelled by the lo self - energy terms .",
    "so finally we get p_real = p_1+p_2= 2 ( 1-x ) x + 2 ( 1-x ) x + ^2 x. [ eq : dp2 ]    of course , an analogous problem occurs in the nlo self - energy terms . here",
    "the @xmath15 correction may be calculated simply , just using the ( particle ) conservation laws .",
    "we obtain @xmath147",
    "to demonstrate the size of the correction numerically , we calculate the @xmath148 cross section starting from the simple input @xmath149 in the ` physical ' scheme , and evolve it over particular @xmath150 intervals ; we recalculate the corresponding input @xmath151 in the conventional @xmath16 scheme ( see ( [ eq : eprime ] ) ) so as to have the same function @xmath152 at the starting scale @xmath153 .",
    "bearing in mind the interest in an analogous qcd effect , we replace the coupling @xmath154 by @xmath155 , and consider evolution from @xmath156 up to @xmath157 and @xmath158 .

    "we use the qcd coupling @xmath159 , in order to indicate potential effects in the relevant application to qcd .",
    "we evolve up from @xmath160 starting from the same @xmath152 in both treatments ( shown by the dotted curve ) . to make the low @xmath73 behaviour more visible we plot @xmath161 , since the non - singlet function @xmath162 as @xmath163 .",

    "they are presented in the traditional form of the non - singlet structure function @xmath164 as a function of @xmath73 , for the two values of @xmath150 .",
    "the solid and dashed curves correspond to the nlo physical and conventional treatments of the infrared region respectively .",
    "the difference is clearly evident at low @xmath73 , and increases with @xmath150 .    of course , for qed , with its very small coupling @xmath165 , the effect is tiny .",
    "however the estimates shown are relevant to indicate possible effects for qcd .    * to conclude ,",
    "* the qed calculation was done here in order to simplify the discussion and to demonstrate that there is a true ` physical ' correction which can not be hidden by the re - definition arising from a particular choice of factorisation scheme .",
    "the corrections to the coefficient and splitting functions do not compensate each other .",
    "moreover , the correction due to the splitting function depends on @xmath150 and increases with @xmath150 , especially at very low @xmath73 .",
    "we emphasize that a correction of @xmath166 to the conventional treatment of the infrared region was already found @xcite in the qcd nlo @xmath167 coefficient in dis ( and in the nlo @xmath168 coefficient function for drell - yan processes ) using the ` physical ' treatment of the infrared region .",
