    "short - range - interaction spin - glass ( sg ) models @xcite have raised a lot of controversies in the last decades . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the case of ising spins represents the most convenient to be investigated , in such a way that a large effort has been dedicated to the understanding of the ising sg model .",
    "the majority of works concentrated on three - dimensional ising sg models , for which , besides its physical realizations , it is generally accepted nowadays that a sg phase occurs at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "hierarchical lattices have been a very useful tool for the study of sg models @xcite , essentially due to the possibility of carrying out exact calculations , or performing relatively low - time - consuming numerical computations .",
    "apart from a few exceptions @xcite , most of the hierarchical lattices considered so far belong to the migdal - kadanoff ( mk ) family .",
    "taking into account the significant reduction of efforts in the investigation of these models , some of the results obtained are quite impressive : ( i ) the lower critical dimension , below which the sg phase transition occurs at zero temperature , which was the object of a lot of controversy about three decades ago , was correctly estimated within a mk renormalization - group ( rg ) approach @xcite , almost a decade before the consensus that this quantity should be greater than 2 , but smaller than 3 , through different numerical approaches , like numerical simulations @xcite and zero - temperature domain - wall arguments @xcite ; ( ii ) the critical - temperature estimates of ref .",
    "@xcite for an ising sg on a mk hierarchical lattice of fractal dimension @xmath0 , with symmetric distributions , are @xmath1  ( @xmath2 distribution ) and @xmath3  ( gaussian distribution of width @xmath4 ) .",
    "the most recent monte carlo simulations on a cubic lattice @xcite yield @xmath5 in the first case , whereas for the later , @xmath6 , leading to relative discrepancies of about @xmath7 when compared with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , taking into account the error bars ; ( iii ) a zero - temperature analysis of a gaussian ising sg , on a special hierarchical lattice with fractal dimension @xmath8 @xcite , yielded an estimate for the stiffness exponent @xmath9 ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the exponent associated with the divergence of the correlation length at zero temperature ) in agreement with those obtained from other , more time - consuming , numerical approaches ; ( iv ) the same hierachical lattice of ref .",
    "@xcite , mentioned above , produced a precise ferromagnetic - paramagnetic critical frontier for the @xmath2 ising sg model @xcite .",
    "a major question in the sg problem nowadays concerns the applicability of some results from the mean - field solution for short - range - interaction systems .",
    "in particular , whether the sg phase is properly described by an infinite number of order parameters ( i.e. , an order - parameter function @xcite ) , manifesting the property of replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) @xcite ; moreover , if an ising sg , in the presence of an external magnetic field , exhibits the almeida - thouless ( at ) line @xcite , which separates a low - temperature region characterized by rsb , from a high - temperature one , described in terms of a single order parameter , along which the replica - symmetric solution holds .",
    "numerical simulations for nearest - neighbor - interaction ising sgs are always hard to be performed , since equilibration becomes difficult for large system sizes and low temperatures . however , in spite of the small lattice sizes considered , there are evidences from monte carlo simulations that a critical line in the presence of a field exists in @xmath12 @xcite , but not in @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a zero - temperature analysis of the energy landscape in the case @xmath13 is compatible with a transition from the sg to the paramagnetic phase for a finite critical field , although the possibility of a critical field equal to zero was not excluded @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to have a critical frontier separating the sg and paramagnetic phases , for low - dimensional short - range - interaction ising sgs in the presence of a magnetic field , which is not an at - like line . in order to ensure that this critical line represents a true at line",
    ", one should also verify evidences of rsb below such a frontier .",
    "this possibility would correspond to an `` intermediate '' scenario @xcite , between the mean - field rsb solution and the much simpler droplet picture @xcite . in this case",
    ", one would expect that rsb effects should appear below this line , at some finite dimension @xmath14 , contrary to claims of the droplet model , according to which the at line should occur only in the limit of infinite dimensions .",
    "one of the advantages for the study of sgs on hierarchical lattices is that one does not go through equilibration difficulties . in view of this , the @xmath0 mk hierarchical lattice has been used also for an investigation of rsb in the low - temperature phase on an ising sg without a magnetic field @xcite . for temperatures in the range @xmath15 , a picture showing characteristics of rsb was observed , although for lower temperatures the results agree with the simpler , replica - symmetric scenario .    to our knowledge , short - range - interaction sgs in the presence of an external magnetic field",
