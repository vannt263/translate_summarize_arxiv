    "cg97 noted that with the zeldovich approximation , the least action solution is that which minimizes the mean square particle displacement , @xmath1 where the @xmath2 are particle displacements .",

    "the galaxies are assigned , at random , initial positions drawn from a homogeneous distribution .",
    "these are represented by piza particles .",
    "applying piza is very simple .",
    "two galaxies are picked at random and their particles are swapped . if s decreases , the swap is kept .",
    "this is repeated until s has been minimized .",
    "cg97 found that @xmath3 500 swaps per particle are needed .",
    "piza minimizes real space galaxy displacements , but we have redshift space displacements . in linear theory , the two are related by ( taylor and valentine 1999 ) ; @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inverse redshift space projection tensor .",
    "the displacement squared is then @xmath6      piza is carried out in the cmb frame , but the survey redshifts are in the local group frame . in the cmb frame ,",
    "@xmath7 to find @xmath8 , a mock galaxy representing the local group is included in piza .      in a flux",
    "limited survey , the number density of objects decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "we thus pick piza particles which obey the galaxy selection function , @xmath9 . to take account of galaxies below the flux limit , we assign each galaxy a mass of @xmath10 and each particle a mass of @xmath11 , where n is the particle - to - galaxy ratio .",
    "there are regions on the sky , such as the galactic plane , that the survey does not cover .",
    "we pick piza particles with the same sky coverage as the survey and neglect piza trajectories that cross the plane .",
    "we have developed a two  step piza method to include these generalizations .",
    "two steps are needed because there are two possibly conflicting conditions to satisfy  the action must be minimized and the mass of each galaxy should be equal to the mass of its particles .    in the first step , each galaxy is assigned n particles .",
    "the particle masses are used in equation ( [ eq : one ] ) , and interchanges are carried out as usual .",
    "the second step attempts to improve on step one , by getting @xmath12 .",
    "a particle is taken from a galaxy with @xmath13 ( too many particles ) and reassigned to a galaxy with @xmath14 ( too few ) .",
    "piza is then applied again , conserving the new particle to galaxy ratios .",
    "generally this must be repeated 15 times .",
    "we have applied our new piza method to pscz - like mock catalogues .",
    "we have tested the reconstruction of real space positions and radial peculiar velocities , and compared our reconstruction with linear theory .",
    "the mock catalogues and linear theory reconstructions were provided by enzo branchini ( branchini et al 1999 ) .",
    "our conclusions from these tests include the following :    @xmath15 the number of swaps needed is greater than that needed in the original piza  approximately 4 times as many .",
    "@xmath15 our reconstructions are generally better than linear theory ( see figure  [ fig : res2 ] )    @xmath15 the reconstructed local group velocity is not very sensitive to the assumed value of @xmath16 .",
    "we have applied our new generalized piza method to the pscz survey ( saunders et al 1995 ; also this volume ) , and present preliminary results here .",
