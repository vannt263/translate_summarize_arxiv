    "there exist a handful of enigmatic x - ray point sources , very likely young neutron stars , positionally coincident with supernova remnants ( snrs ) whose nature remains uncertain .",
    "these objects are commonly referred to as central compact objects ( ccos ) that are characterized by soft , thermal x - ray spectra and an absence of ordinary pulsar activity such as radio pulsations , @xmath5-ray emission and pulsar wind nebulae ( pavlov et al .  2002a , 2004 ) .",
    "the cco 1e  1207.4@xmath05209  ( 1e1207  hereafter ) in the pks 1209@xmath051/52 snr is a particularly interesting member of this class in that it is both an x - ray pulsar ( with a 0.424 s period ; zavlin et al .",
    "2000 ) and the only cco found to possess prominent absorption lines in its spectrum ( sanwal et al .",
    "the x - ray energy spectrum is best modeled with a continuum blackbody component of temperature @xmath6 0.14 kev and at least two broad absorption lines centered at 0.7 and 1.4 kev .",
    "the strength of these lines depend upon the rotational phase of the pulsar ( mereghetti et al .  2002 ) . two additional features , at 2.1 and 2.8 kev ,",
    "have been reported ( bignami et al .",
    "2003 ) ; however , their validity has been questioned ( mori , chonco & hailey 2005 ) .",
    "the physical origin for the spectral lines remains unknown .",
    "sanwal et al.(2002 ) have concluded that these lines can not be associated with transitions in hydrogen atoms and argued that neither electron nor proton cyclotron resonance could cause these features .",
    "these authors suggest that the lines could be due to absorption by once - ionized helium in a magnetic field @xmath7 g ( see also pavlov & bezchastnov 2005 ) , while hailey & mori ( 2002 ) and mori & hailey ( 2006 ) argue that the lines could be formed in an oxygen atmosphere with @xmath8@xmath9 g. as different interpretation imply very different magnetic field strengths , measuring the field strength of 1e1207would be most important for understanding the nature of the spectral lines . for isolated pulsars ,",
    "the most straightforward method for estimating dipole magnetic field strengths is to measure the spin frequency @xmath10 and its time derivative ( spin - down rate ) @xmath11 .",
    "zavlin , pavlov & sanwal ( 2004 ) studied the spin evolution of 1e1207  using a compilation of _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations covering 3.5 years .",
    "they found that the spin frequency of this pulsar is not steadily decreasing as one would expect for a magnetically - braking dipole .",
    "instead , the frequency evolution was quite erratic , leading zavlin et al .  to consider three possible explanations : ( @xmath12 ) the star is undergoing frequent glitches , ( @xmath13 ) the star is surrounded by a debris disk that influences its spin evolution through accretion and propeller torques , or ( @xmath14 ) the star is a member of a ( non - accreting ) binary system .",
    "another possibility is that the spin - down of the star is influenced by timing noise , a ubiquitous property of isolated neutron stars whose physical origin is unclear .",
    "the sparse frequency history of 1e1207  could not distinguish between these models .",
    "here , we report on a sequence of seven _ xmm - newton _  observations of 1e1207  that were designed to perform phase - coherent timing in order to precisely measure the pulse frequency and frequency derivative of the source .",
    "a measurement of the local frequency derivative would help us to distinguish between the possible scenarios .",
    "below , we describe the observation (  2 ) and our timing analysis of the _ xmm - newton _  data set (  3 ) , and discuss the resulting constraints on the physical mechanisms for the spin - frequency evolution in 1e1207  (  4 ) .",
    "during a 40 day interval between 2005 june 22 and july 31 , _ xmm - newton _   observed 1e1207  seven times , with the epic pn camera as the primary instrument .",
    "the first three and last two pointings had effective exposures of 10@xmath015 ks , while the central ( fourth ) exposure was about 45 ks .",
    "the fifth pointing of about 7 ks exposure was shorter than planned because of strong background contamination .",
    "the spacing between consecutive observations was approximately 15 , 5 , 1 , 1 , 5 , and 15 days .",
    "the spacing and durations of the _ xmm - newton _  pointings were planned in such a way as to allow phase - coherent timing of the pulsar over the full time span of 40 days ( see  3 ) .",

    "the numbers of selected counts are given in table  1 ( background was estimated to contribute less than 15% in each dataset ) .",
    "phase - coherent timing analysis requires careful spacing of individual observations such that an extrapolation of the measured phase model , @xmath25 , for a given observation or set of observations is precise enough to predict the phase to the next observation to much better than a pulse cycle .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that one can achieve far more precise measurements of the pulse frequency and higher derivatives than by using independent pulse frequency measurements with the same total exposure .",
    "this approach is commonly applied to all types of pulsars , including anomalous x - ray pulsars ( e.g.  gavriil & kaspi 2004 ) , soft gamma repeaters ( e.g.  woods et al .",
    "2002 ) , and radio - quiet isolated neutron stars ( kaplan & van kerkwijk 2005a , b ) .",
    "as the frequency error ( @xmath26 ) in an individual observation is inversely proportional to its duration , @xmath27 , the longer central exposure served as our reference point .",
    "we measured the pulse frequency during this observation first via a @xmath28 search ( see  3.2 ) and then refined this measurement as follows .",
    "we split the observation into 4 segments and folded these segments on the measured frequency to generate pulse profiles for each segment .",
    "next , we cross - correlated each pulse profile with a high signal - to - noise pulse template and measured phase offsets .",
    "the pulse template is first derived from the central observation folded at the initial frequency .",
    "the phase offsets for the 4 segments were fitted to a straight line and the slope of this line was added to the initial frequency to produce our refined frequency .",
    "the short gaps between the central exposure and the adjacent exposures were expected to preserve the phase information , i.e. the propagated phase error ( e.g. , between the 4-th and 5-th observations , @xmath29 ) was expected to be @xmath30 cycle , which would mean that no pulse cycles are missed in the phase model . as one incorporates more and more data over a wider time span , the precision of the phase model improves , and one can tolerate larger gaps between observations .",
    "note that the template pulse profile is updated as more data are included until the full data set is utilized . by the time we incorporated the measured phases from the first and final observations into our fit , it became clear that the phase offsets",
    "did not conform to a simple linear trend , and a quadratic term ( @xmath31 ) was added to the phase model , @xmath32 . however , even the inclusion of the quadratic term did not reduce the variance of the phase residuals to the point where we obtained an acceptable fit ( @xmath33 = 19.2 for 8 degrees of freedom ; see fig .  1 ) .    ]",
    "the poor fit to the quadratic phase model indicated that we either converged on an alias solution or 1e1207  exhibits significant `` phase noise '' on a time scale of weeks .",
    "an alias timing solution would be when there are an incorrect number of cycle counts between consecutive observations .",
    "phase noise can be characterized in many ways such as the presence of a strong cubic term ( @xmath34 ) , white noise , periodic variations , etc . to ensure that the poor @xmath33 value in the solution we found is _ not _ the consequence of misidentified cycle counts , we employed a technique used for timing noisy rotators such as soft gamma repeaters ( woods et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this technique",
    ", we measure the pulse phase and frequency at each of the 7 observing epochs .",
    "the phase for each observation was measured by folding the data from each observation on a pulse ephemeris of constant frequency determined by the central observation and computing the phase difference between this profile and a template pulse profile .",
    "the pulse frequencies for the short observations were measured by splitting the data into two segments of equal duration , folding each segment on the pulse frequency measured for the central observation , measuring phase shifts for each pulse profile relative to the pulse template , and fitting these two pulse phases to a line to determine the local pulse frequency . finally , we perform a least - squares fit to the set of 7 phases and 7 frequencies , where we vary the number of cycles between consecutive observations by integer increments ( woods et al .  2006 ) .",
    "this provides a family of solutions to the full data set which define the pulse phase evolution according to a quadratic model covering the 40-day time interval .",
    "none of the solutions ( for a quadratic phase model ) provide a statistically acceptable fit to the data . for all possible solutions , the `` null hypothesis probability '' ( i.e. the probability of measuring the large @xmath33 values by chance , assuming that the model is correct ) is very small .",
    "fit parameters for the top three solutions ( ranked in order of increasing @xmath33 ) are given in table  [ tab : spin ] .",
    "we chose to consider a limited number of solutions ; therefore , we selected only the solutions that had a probability of getting the measured @xmath33 by chance of 10@xmath35 or larger ( three solutions ) .",
    "we found that the best - fit model is equivalent to the solution we identified via our bootstrap phase - fitting method described earlier .",
    "phase residuals for this model are shown in figure  [ fig : phases ] .",
    "since none of the identified solutions provide a statistically - acceptable fit to the data , we conclude that 1e1207  does , in fact , exhibit significant phase noise on a time scale of weeks .",
    "it seems unlikely that the excess noise we observed is due to underestimating our phase errors .",

    "to place some constraints on the frequency derivative during our observing sequence , we employed a monte - carlo simulation to estimate statistical significance of the multiple solutions . for this simulation , we first had to choose a model for the phase noise .",
    "we selected two models : ( @xmath12 ) a cubic phase term and ( @xmath13 ) white noise . in both cases ,",
    "the amplitude of the model noise variance was equal to the total variance in the top three fits to the data minus the statistical variance . in our simulation , we generated phases for each observing epoch which included three components : the model phase ( including @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms ) , gaussian measurement noise , and the model phase noise .",
    "in addition , we simulated frequency measurements at each epoch assuming gaussian measurement noise ( i.e.  we neglect phase noise on the time scale of the observation duration ) . for each phase model , we generated 10@xmath45 realizations and fit for the cycle counts between consecutive epochs as we did for the measured data to identify all possible timing solutions for each realization . in each realization , we identified the rank of the true timing solution in terms of @xmath33 .",
    "the most constraining results were obtained from the white noise model for the phase noise . for this model , we found that the true timing solution was among the top three solutions ( ranked in order of @xmath33 ) 90% of the time and was the top solution 65% of the time .",
    "assuming white phase noise , our simulation suggests that we can be 90% confident that the true pulse ephemeris for 1e1207  is mod1 , mod2 or mod3 given in table  [ tab : spin ] .",
    "similarly , these results suggest there is a 65% chance that mod1 defines the appropriate cycle counts between observing epochs , and hence , reflects the correct pulse ephemeris",
    ".    the differences between the three pulse ephemerides listed in table  [ tab : spin ] amount to small differences in the cycle counts between the four outer observations in our observing sequence ( i.e.  a few additional or less cycles between observations 1 and 2 , 2 and 3 , 5 and 6 , and 6 and 7 ) .",
    "in fact , we can only be sure of the cycle count accuracy between the three central observations ( observations 3 , 4 and 5 in table  [ tab : xmmobs ] ) . to show this explicitly , we fit for the cycle counts between the central three observations as we did for the full data set , only we limited the order of the phase model to be first order on account of the short time span ( 2 days ) .",
    "we measure a difference in @xmath33 of 91 for 3 degrees of freedom between the best - fit ephemeris identified in our search and the next closest .",
    "clearly , we were able to phase - connect this subset of the data and unambiguously identify the local pulse frequency ( @xmath46 hz over the time range 53561.328 to 53563.347 mjd tdb ) .",
    "although the method described in this section is very efficient , it has some limitations . for large cycle count corrections between consecutive observations ,",
    "the local pulse ephemeris will change considerably as will the folded pulse profile . in turn",
    ", the pulse phase measurement will likely also be affected . in practice , the differences in the pulse shapes of 1e1207  for the three pulse ephemerides reported here are insignificant .",
    "for very large cycle count corrections , where this effect becomes important , the @xmath33 contribution from the frequency measurements begin to dominate the total @xmath33 , and these peaks are effectively suppressed .",
    "even so , this method is relatively new and not extensively tested . to verify the results obtained with this technique",
    ", we employ the @xmath47 test , a traditional approach to x - ray timing .      the @xmath48 statistic ( e.g. , buccheri et al .  1983 )",

    "the expected peak value of @xmath38 is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the pulsed fraction . for 1e1207 ,",
    "the pulsed fraction was measured to be @xmath578%12% ( zavlin et al .",
    "2000 ; pavlov et al .",
    "the peak @xmath58 values found in the individual data sets ( table  1 ) are in a reasonable agreement with those given by this estimate .",
    "the @xmath47 test has been used for a phase - coherent timing analysis of several observations spread over a large time span by mattox et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and zavlin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and we follow the approach described by those authors . to account for the phase connection",
    ", we apply the @xmath47 test ( for @xmath59 and 2 ) to the whole data set of seven observations . to determine the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath60 of the quadratic phase model , we calculated the @xmath47 on a dense two - dimensional grid [ @xmath6181 @xmath62hz , @xmath63 hz s@xmath4 ] , with @xmath10 and @xmath60 spacings of 0.02 @xmath62hz and @xmath65 hz s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "a contour map obtained with the @xmath38 statistic is shown in figure  [ fig : grid ] . because of the cycle - count ambiguities during the gaps between the consecutive observations , the map shows multiple peaks , one of them corresponding to the true @xmath10,@xmath11 solution and the others being aliases .",
    "the first , third and fourth highest peaks in this map correspond to mod1 , mod3 and mod2 , respectively ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the top three peaks in a similar @xmath39 map are at the same @xmath10,@xmath60 as mod1 , mod2 and mod3 , respectively .",
    "if the phase connection between separate data sets were perfect , then the peak corresponding to the true solution would be much higher than the aliases .",
    "however , in our case the difference between the heights of the peaks turned out to be too small to single out a unique solution .",
    "for instance , in addition to the highest peak in the @xmath38 map , @xmath66 at @xmath67 @xmath62hz , @xmath68 hz s@xmath4 , we see four peaks with @xmath69 in figure  [ fig : grid ] , at different @xmath10,@xmath60 values .",
    "similar to the method described in  3.1 , the differences in peak values of @xmath10,@xmath60 correspond to different ( integer ) numbers of cycles ( @xmath70 ) during the full observational time span @xmath71 ks .",
    "we are not aware of statistical criteria to estimate significance of separate peaks in this approach , and we can only assume that the solutions corresponding to several highest @xmath47 peaks can not be ruled out on statistical grounds .",
    "we also note that the lack of perfect phase - coherence is supported by the fact that the largest @xmath72 is much smaller than @xmath73 ( at the same @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , the value we would expect to obtain for perfect phase connection .",
    "thus , the results of the @xmath47 search for the 1e1207  frequency and frequency derivative are generally consistent with the results reported in  3.1 .",

    "the deviations from monotonic spin - down in 1e1207  are substantial , and they manifest on timescales of years to as short as possibly weeks as evidenced by the phase noise detected here .",
    "we now consider four possibilities for both the erratic long - term spin behavior and short - term phase noise in 1e1207 : ( @xmath12 ) frequent glitching , ( @xmath13 ) accretion and propeller torques from a circumstellar debris disk , ( @xmath14 ) timing noise in an isolated neutron star , and ( @xmath75 ) orbital doppler shifts caused by the presence of a binary companion .    for any glitch model",
    ", the glitch frequency and amplitude would have to be very high to account for the observed spin variability ( see zavlin et al .",
    "moreover , the most viable timing solutions indicating spin down over the 40-day observing span differ from the long - term spin - down of 1e1207  over the last 5.5 years ( @xmath764 @xmath2 @xmath77 hz s@xmath4 ) by an order of magnitude .",
    "for example , the most likely spin - down solution ( mod2 ) has a frequency derivative more than one order of magnitude larger . because only a very contrived glitch model could account for the long - term frequency history , and this model would provide no explanation for the short - term phase noise , the glitch model is effectively excluded by these observations .",
    "debris disks left over from the supernova explosions that produce neutron stars could alter the spin evolution of the central neutron star via accretion and propeller torques ( zavlin et al .",
    "if the spin - up rate of 1e1207  during the 40-day interval were equal to the values measured for mod1 or mod3 , then the mass accretion rate would have to be very large ( @xmath78 g s@xmath4 ) .",
    "such a large accretion rate would require a large increase in x - ray luminosity which is not observed .",
    "even the spin - down solutions would require significant optical and ir emission from the disk .",
    "deep ir observations of 1e1207  have shown no indication of even a cool , passive debris disk ( wang , kaplan & chakrabarty 2006 ) .",
    "thus , it appears unlikely that a debris disk is the cause of the spin variability in 1e1207 .",
    "timing noise ( irregular evolution of the pulse phase with time ) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in isolated neutron stars .",
    "this variability is in addition to the usual variation caused by magnetic braking .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the magnitude of these irregular variations depends upon the spin - down rate of the pulsar ( e.g. , cordes & helfand 1980 ) .",
    "millisecond pulsars show the smallest timing noise while magnetars exhibit very strong timing noise . in the case of magnetars",
    ", these variations manifest as changes in the effective spin - down rate of up to factors of 5 on a time scale of years . for a convenient ( albeit crude )",
    "description of timing noise , arzoumanian et al .  ( 1994 ) introduced a `` stability parameter '' defined by the following equation : @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the time during which the pulse phase has been monitored ( @xmath81 s is a commonly used characteristic time ) , and @xmath82 is the formal value of the second frequency derivative obtained from fitting a cubic model to pulse phases ( it is much larger in magnitude than the actual @xmath82 for noisy pulsars ) .",
    "third - order polynomial fits to the 1e1207  phase residuals of the top three candidate timing solutions yielded insignificant measurements of @xmath82 .",
    "the timing observations of 1e1207  during 5.5 years were too sparse to fit the pulse phases with any model .",
    "therefore , to estimate @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we fitted the dependence @xmath84 to the frequency history covering the last 5.5 years .",
    "( the same exercise was performed by heyl & hernquist 1999 for some anomalous x - ray pulsars , and it was shown to be reasonably accurate by gavriil & kaspi 2004 . ) choosing @xmath85 mjd tdb , we found @xmath86 @xmath62hz , @xmath87 hz s@xmath4 , and @xmath88 hz s@xmath89 , which translates to a timing noise level of @xmath90 . in figure",

    "although such an estimate for the timing noise parameter is , by necessity , very crude , its enormously high magnitude , together with the gross inconsistency of the local ( june - july 2005 ) spin - down rate with the long - term average , suggest that the erratic frequency behavior in this source is not due to the same effect that causes timing noise in other isolated neutron stars .",

    "we observed 1e1207  with _ xmm - newton _  seven times during the course of a 40 day interval in an effort to measure the local pulse frequency and frequency derivative with high precision .",
    "due to unanticipated phase noise , we were unable to phase - connect the full data set . from systematic pulse ephemeris searches , we identified a number of possible timing solutions , none of which had spin - down rates close to the average spin - down rate of 1e1207  over the last 5 years .",
    "the interpretation of the erratic long - term timing behavior of 1e1207  in terms of the usual pulsar timing noise would require timing noise levels much higher than seen in isolated neutron stars with comparable spin - down rates .",
    "the most plausible explanation for the erratic long - term pulse frequency evolution of 1e1207  is the presence of a binary companion , although the current data do not allow us to place strong constraints on system parameters .",
    "further efforts at phase - coherent pulse timing observations of 1e1207  are required to ( @xmath12 ) unambiguously identify the nature of the long - term pulse frequency variations , and ( @xmath13 ) confirm and further investigate the observed short - term phase noise .",
    "just one additional 40-day observing sequence with higher sampling would yield far better constraints on orbital parameters should 1e1207 , in fact , possess a binary companion ."
