    "<S> in the case of three quark flavors , ( pseudo)scalar diquarks transform as antiquarks under chiral transformations . </S>",
    "<S> we construct four spin-1/2 baryonic multiplets from left- and right - handed quarks as well as left- and right - handed diquarks . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that two of these multiplets transform in a `` mirror '' way allows for chirally invariant mass terms . </S>",
    "<S> we then embed these baryonic multiplets into the lagrangian of the so - called extended linear sigma model , which features ( pseudo)scalar and ( axial-)vector mesons , as well as glueballs . reducing the lagrangian to the two - flavor case </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain four doublets of nucleonic states . these mix to produce four experimentally observed states with definite parity : the positive - parity nucleon @xmath0 and roper resonance @xmath1 , as well as the negative - parity resonances @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the parameters of the nucleonic part of the lagrangian from a fit to masses and decay properties of the aforementioned states . </S>",
    "<S> studying the limit of vanishing quark condensate , we conclude that @xmath0 and @xmath2 , as well as @xmath1 and @xmath3 form pairs of chiral partners . </S>"
