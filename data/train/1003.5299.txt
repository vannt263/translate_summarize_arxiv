    "the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath1 ) has been investigated intensively for more than twenty years @xcite . on the one hand , these investigations may help to gain deeper understanding of dcsb in qcd . on the other hand",
    ", this non - perturbative phenomenon gives an elegant field theoretic description for the formation of long - range antiferromagnetic order in two - dimensional quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "using the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equation approach , appelquist _ et _ _ al .",
    "_ first found that dcsb caused by fermion mass generation takes place only when the fermion flavor @xmath2 is below some critical value @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 , the fermions remain massless and the chiral symmetry is preserved .",
    "although there was some controversy about the existence and precise value of @xmath3 in the literature , most analytical and numerical computations confirmed that @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the dcsb is realized by forming fermion - anti - fermion pairs mediated by strong gauge interaction . in order to trigger this low - energy phenomenon ,",
    "an essential requirement is that the gauge interaction between fermions should be sufficiently long - ranged .",
    "if the gauge field develops an effective screening length , then the gauge interaction is significantly weakened .",
    "we have considered the effect of a finite gauge boson mass @xmath6 on dcsb previously @xcite , and found that the increasing @xmath6 leads to a significant suppression of dcsb .",
    "when the action contains only massless dirac fermions and non - compact gauge field , the gauge interaction is always long - ranged since the gauge invariance ensures that no photon mass term can be generated by the radial correction from fermions .",
    "if the gauge field also couples to an additional abelian higgs model , then the photon can acquire a finite mass via the anderson - higgs mechanism in the superconducting state @xcite . in the context of high temperature superconductor , the suppression of dcsb by photon mass @xmath6 can be used to qualitatively understand the competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity , which is one of the most prominent phenomena in high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "apart from anderson - higgs mechanism , the gauge field may also be screened by other physical effects .",
    "for example , when the fermion density is nonzero , the chemical potential @xmath7 should be explicitly taken into account .",
    "in addition , the fermions may be scattered by some impurity atom ( defect or imperfection ) in realistic interacting system described by qed@xmath8 .",
    "although generally chemical potential and impurity scattering have distinct influences on the physical properties of the interacting fermion system , there is a common feature that they can both induce a finite density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this screens the time component of the gauge field , which then becomes short - ranged .",
    "however , the transverse gauge field remains long - ranged in the sense that the static screening length still diverges as at zero chemical potential in the clean limit ( `` clean '' means there is completely no impurity scattering ) . in principle , the long - range nature of transverse gauge field is guaranteed by the gauge invariance .",
    "however , though the transverse part is unscreened , the effective gauge interaction strength is reduced by the fermion density caused by chemical potential and/or impurity scattering process , which certainly affects the critical flavor @xmath3 as well as the dynamical fermion mass .",
    "besides generating finite fermion density , the impurity scattering leads to the damping of fermionic quantum states by producing a finite scattering rate @xmath9 .",
    "such damping effect reduces the lifetime of a fermion staying at a definite quantum state , specified by such quantum numbers as momentum and/or energy .",
    "this will also have important effects on dcsb .",
    "while there appeared several papers discussing the effect of chemical potential on dcsb in qed@xmath1 @xcite , to our knowledge the effect of impurity scattering has never been considered in previous work .",
    "indeed , in any realistic applications of qed@xmath1 to condensed matter physics , such as high temperature superconductor , the chemical potential and impurity scattering are usually important and thus should not been ignored .",

    "the above investigation and result are valid at zero chemical potential in clean fermion system .",
    "till now , little attention has been paid to the case with finite fermion density and finite impurity potential . since the chemical potential and impurity scattering are generally very important in realistic applications , it is important to examine their effects on dcsb .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study this problem .",
    "first of all , at nonzero chemical potential the fermions have a finite density at the fermi level , which screens the temporal component of gauge field and weakens the gauge interaction .",
    "the influence of chemical potential on dcsb was previously discussed by feng _ et _ _ al .",
    "they derived an explicit equation to include the chemical potential into the ds equation .",
    "one crucial assumption in their work is the neglecting of chemical potential in the vacuum polarization function .",
    "the numerical results of feng _ et _ _ al . _",
    "show that the chemical potential leads to only insignificant change of @xmath0 and fermion mass .",
    "we think that the screening effect caused by chemical potential is very important and hence will pay special attention to the screening of gauge field induced by chemical potential by studying the vacuum polarization .",
    "as will be shown in the context , the chemical potential suppresses both @xmath0 and fermion mass strongly .",
    "the effect of impurity scattering is more complicated than chemical potential . generally , the scattering of fermions by impurity potential has two important effects .",
    "first , it generates a finite density of states at low energy , which also screens the gauge field .",
    "this effect is expected to weaken the gauge interaction , analogous to the role played by the chemical potential .",
    "second , the impurity scattering produces a finite damping of fermion quantum states and thus reduces the time for massless dirac fermions to interact with their anti - particles .",
    "these two effects are both very important .",
    "the behavior of massless dirac fermions in a random potential is of great interest in the context of condensed matter physics since the low - energy properties of some many - body systems , such as @xmath50-wave high temperature superconductor and graphene , are largely controlled by the interaction of dirac fermion with impurities .",
    "unfortunately , at present the problem of random dirac fermion has not been fully understood even when there is no direct interaction between fermions . when the impurity scattering and gauge interaction are both important , the problem is basically out of theoretical control .",
    "if we consider a single impurity atom , then the impurity scattering can be treated by the self - consistent born approximation . within this approximation ,",
    "the retarded fermion self - energy function develops a finite imaginary part , which is usually represented by a constant scattering rate @xmath51 . to study the problem about impurity scattering , it is most convenient to work in the matsubara formalism and write the fermion propagator as @xmath52 where the frequency is @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "once the impurity scattering rate is taken into account , the fermion frequency should be replaced by @xmath55 the fermion damping effect can be intuitively understood as follows .",
    "after analytical continuation , @xmath56 the retarded fermion propagator has the form @xmath57 after fourier transformation , it becomes @xmath58 in real space .",
    "apparently , the parameter @xmath51 measures the decaying rate of the fermionic state characterized by such quantum numbers as @xmath59 , which is known as the landau damping effect . starting from the propagator eq .",
    "( [ eq : propagator_gamma ] ) , various physical quantities can be calculated and compared with experiments . intuitively , the damping effect is at variance with dcsb since a fermion may be scattered into another state before it combines with its anti - particle to form a stable pair .    before we set up the ds equation for fermion self - energy ,",
    "we need first to calculate the photon propagator and discuss the screening effect caused by chemical potential and impurity scattering within the matsubara formalism . with finite chemical potential @xmath7 and finite damping rate @xmath51 ,",
    "the fermion propagator reads @xmath60 the energy shift caused by chemical potential and the damping effect caused by impurity scattering are both reflected in this propagator .",

    "the pairs are formed by fermions slightly above dirac points and anti - fermions ( holes in condensed matter terminology ) slightly below the dirac points .",
    "once the fermions become massive , they are confined . at finite chemical potential ,",
    "the pairs are formed by fermions slightly above the finite fermi surface and anti - fermions slightly below fermi surface .",
    "the massive fermions are also confined by the gauge force .    in realistic condensed matter systems ,",
    "the fermion density or chemical potential can be continually turned by chemical doping or gate voltage .",
    "we first have a number of samples , each with different chemical potential , and let them stay at some finite temperature where dcsb is completely prevented by thermal fluctuations .",
    "we then cool down these samples and study whether dcsb indeed take place at very low temperature by measuring some observable quantities , such as specific heat , susceptibility , and electric conductivity . through this way , in principle the effect of finite chemical potential on the fate of dcsb can be experimentally studied .",
    "we emphasize that our treatment on the random potential applies only to the case of weak impurity potential where the self - consistent born approximation is valid .",
    "when the random potential caused by impurities takes the form of gaussian white noise , such treatment might be questionable .",
    "for this kind of impurities , the random potential has to be averaged by performing proper functional integration , which yields an effective four - fermion interaction in the whole action .",
    "this new effective interaction can contribute a new term to the ds equation . at present",
    ", it is unclear technically how to study the dcsb and the fermion damping effect in a unified framework .",
    "this problem is subject to further investigation .",

    "<S> we study the effects of finite chemical potential and impurity scattering on dynamical fermion mass generation in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics . in any realistic systems </S>",
    "<S> , these effects usually can not be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal component of gauge field develops a finite static length produced by chemical potential and impurity scattering , while the transverse component remains long - ranged because of the gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> another important consequence of impurity scattering is that the fermions have a finite damping rate , which reduces their lifetime staying in a definite quantum state . by solving the dyson - schwinger equation for fermion mass function </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that these effects lead to strong suppression of the critical fermion flavor @xmath0 and the dynamical fermion mass in the symmetry broken phase . </S>"
