    "the argo - ybj experiment is under way over the next few years at yangbajing high altitude cosmic ray laboratory ( 4300 m a.s.l .",
    ", 606 @xmath4 ) , 90 km north to lhasa ( tibet , p.r .",
    "the aim of the experiment is the study of cosmic rays , mainly cosmic @xmath5-radiation , at an energy threshold of @xmath6 @xmath7 , by means of the detection of small size air showers at high altitude .",
    "the apparatus consists of a full coverage detector of dimension @xmath8 realized with a single layer of resistive plate counters ( rpcs ) .",
    "the area surrounding the central detector core , up to @xmath9 , consists of a guard ring partially ( @xmath10 ) instrumented with rpcs .",
    "these outer detector improves the apparatus performance , enlarging the fiducial area , for the detection of showers with the core outside the full coverage carpet .",
    "a lead converter @xmath11 @xmath12 thick will cover uniformly the rpc plane in order to increase the number of charged particles by conversion of shower photons and to reduce the time spread of the shower front . the site location ( longitude @xmath13 31 50  e , latitude @xmath14 06 38 ",
    "n ) permits the monitoring of the northern hemisphere in the declination band @xmath15 .",
    "such a detector , performing a continuous high sensitivity sky survey , complements the narrow field of view air cerenkov telescopes allowing to bridge the gev and tev energy regions and to face a wide range of fundamental issues in cosmic ray and astroparticle physics including @xmath5-ray astronomy , grbs physics and the measurement of the @xmath16 at tev energies @xcite .",
    "detector assembling will start late in 2000 and data taking with the first @xmath0 750 @xmath17 of rpcs in 2001 .    in order to investigate both the rpcs performance at 4300 @xmath18 a.s.l . and the capability of the detector to sample the shower front of atmospheric cascades , during 1998 a full coverage carpet of @xmath19 has been put in operation in the yangbajing ( ybj ) laboratory .",
    "results concerning both the rpcs behaviour and the features of the showers imaged by the carpet are presented .",
    "the set - up of the detector is an array of @xmath20 chambers of area @xmath21 @xmath22 each , covering a total area of @xmath23 @xmath17 .",
    "the active area of @xmath24 @xmath17 , accounting for a dead area due to a @xmath25 @xmath26 frame closing the chamber edge , corresponds to a @xmath27 coverage .",
    "the rpcs , with a @xmath28 @xmath26 gas gap , are built with bakelite electrode plates of volume resistivity in the range ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30 .",
    "the rpc signals are picked up by means of aluminum strips @xmath31 @xmath12 wide and @xmath32 @xmath12 long which are glued on a @xmath33 @xmath26 thick film of poly - ethylen - tereftalate ( pet ) . at the edge of the detector",
    "the strips are connected to the front - end electronics and terminated with 50 @xmath34 resistors .",
    "a grounded aluminum foil is used to shield the bottom face of the rpc and an extra pet foil , on top of the aluminum , is used as a further high voltage insulator .",
    "the front - end circuit contains 16 discriminators , with about @xmath35 @xmath36 voltage threshold , and provides a fast - or signal with the same input - to - output delay ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) for all the channels .",
    "this signal is used for time measurements and trigger purposes in the present test .",
    "the 16 strips connected to the same front - end board are logically organized in a pad of @xmath39 @xmath40 area .",
    "each rpc is therefore subdivided in 10 pads which work like independent functional units .",
    "the pads are the basic elements ( `` pixel '' ) which define the space - time pattern of the shower ; they give indeed the position and the time of each detected hit . at any trigger occurrence",
    "the times of all the pads are read - out by means of multihit tdcs of @xmath41 @xmath38 time bin , operated in common stop mode .",
    "since the pad signal is shaped to 1.5 @xmath42 , only the time profile of the earliest particles hitting the pads is imaged .",
    "the set - up was completed with a small telescope consisting of 3 rpcs of @xmath43 @xmath40 area with 16 pick - up strips @xmath44 @xmath12 wide connected to front - end electronics board similar to the ones used in the carpet .",
    "the 3 rpcs were overlapped one on the other and the triple coincidence of their fast - or signals was used to define a cosmic ray crossing the telescope .",
    "the rpcs were operated in streamer mode as foreseen for the final experiment .",
    "this mode delivers large amplitude saturated signals and is less sensitive than the avalanche or proportional mode to electromagnetic noise , to changes in the environment conditions and to mechanical deformations of the detector .",
    "three gas mixtures were tested which used the same components , argon , isobutane and tetrafluoroethane , in different proportions : tfe / ar / i - but = 45/45/10 ; 60/27/13 and 75/15/10 . an higher tfe concentration in place of the ar concentration increases the primary ionization thus compensating for the @xmath45 reduction caused by the lower gas target pressure ( 600 @xmath46 ) and reduces the afterpulse probability .",
    "the reduction of the argon concentration in favour of tfe results in a clear increase of the operating voltage as expected from the large quenching action of tfe . since the higher the tfe fraction",
    ", the lower is the charge delivered in the gas by a single streamer , we decided to operate the test carpet with the gas mixture corresponding to the highest tfe fraction , in order to extend the dynamic range achievable for the analogical read - out .",
    "[ effic ] shows the operating efficiency for 4 ored pads .",
    "the efficiency was measured using cosmic ray signals defined by means of an auxiliary telescope placed on top of the carpet .",
    "the same curve for a @xmath28 @xmath26 gap rpc operated at sea level is also shown for comparison .",
    "the detection efficiency @xmath47 operating voltage , compared to the operation at @xmath48 @xmath46 pressure in ybj , shows an increase of @xmath49 @xmath50 in operating voltage .",
    "the effect of small changes in temperature @xmath51 and pressure @xmath52 on the operating voltage can be accounted for by rescaling the applied voltage @xmath53 according to the relationship : v = v_a where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are arbitrary standard values , e.g. @xmath56 @xmath46 and @xmath57 @xmath58 respectively for a sea level laboratory .",
    "this formula predicts , starting from the ybj data , an operating voltage at sea level which is considerably smaller than the experimental one .",
    "however , a good consistency is recovered by assuming that , in the ideal gas approximation , the parameter which fixes the operating voltage is given by _",
    "gap @xmath59 pressure / temperature_. measurements on rpcs with different gas gap size justify this assumption .",
    "[ effic ] also shows that the plateau efficiency measured at ybj is @xmath60 lower than at the sea level .",
    "although a lower efficiency is expected from the smaller number of primary clusters at the ybj pressure , we attribute most of the difference to the underestimation of the ybj efficiency . at ybj altitude , indeed , the ratio of the cosmic radiation electromagnetic to muon component is @xmath61 times larger than at sea level .",
    "a spatial tracking with redefinition of the carpet track downstream would eliminate the contamination from soft particles , giving a more accurate and higher efficiency . on the other hand the lower efficiency",
    "could hardly be explained with the gas lower density .",
    "in fact , the number of primary clusters in the ybj test , estimated around @xmath62 , is the same as in the case of some gas , e.g. ar / i - but / cf3br = 60/37/3 , that was frequently used at sea level with efficiency of @xmath63 .    the counting rate of 4 ored pads , together with the rpc current ,",
    "are reported in fig .",
    "[ countrate ] @xmath47 the operating voltage .",
    "the results for a percentage of @xmath64 of tfe are also reported for comparison . a rather flat singles counting rate plateau is observed at a level of @xmath65 @xmath66 for a single pad of area @xmath67 @xmath40 .",
    "the time jitter distribution of the pad signals was obtained by measuring the delay of the fast - or signal with respect to rpc2 ( the rpc in the central position of the trigger telescope ) by means of a tdc with 1 @xmath38 time bin .",
    "this distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ timej ] for four pads .",
    "the average of the standard deviations is @xmath68 @xmath38 corresponding to a resolution of @xmath69 @xmath38 for the single rpc if we account for the fact that the distributions show the combined jitter of two detectors . a more detailed presentation of these results is reported in @xcite .",
    "data were taken either with or without a 0.5 @xmath12 layer of lead on the whole carpet in order to investigate the converter effect on multiplicity and angular resolution .",
    "a trigger based on pad multiplicity has been used to collect @xmath70 shower events in april - may 1998 .    the integral rate as a function of the pad multiplicity is shown in fig .",
    "[ freq ] for showers before and after the lead was installed .",
    "a comparison at fixed rate indicates an increase of pad multiplicity due to the effect of the lead of @xmath71 , as expected according to our simulations . since in this test",
    "the strip read - out is not effective , the actual multiplicity is understimed for particle densities higher than @xmath69 @xmath72 .",
    "data have been corrected to obtain the average particle density as a function of the recorded multiplicity ( fig .",
    "[ densit ] ) .      due to the reduced size of the detector",
    ", the time profile of the shower front sampled by the carpet is expected to exhibit a planar shape . in this approximation",
    "the expected particle arrival time is a linear function of the position .",
    "we performe an optimized reconstruction procedure of the shower direction as follows :    * unweighted plane fit to hits for each event by minimization of the function ^2 = _ i\\{lx_i + my_i + nz_i - c(t_i - t_0)}^2 the sum includes all counters with a time signal @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the light velocity , @xmath75 are the @xmath76th center pad position coordinates .",
    "the parameters of the fit are the time offset @xmath77 and the @xmath78 direction cosines . *",
    "rejection of outlying points by means of a @xmath79 cut and iteration of the fit until all points verify this condition . if the remaining hits number is @xmath80 the event is rejected . here",
    "@xmath81 is the standard deviation of the distribution .",
    "this procedure is rather fast because it makes use only of analytic formulae .",
    "no _ a priori _ information about shower features is required .",
    "the actual value of @xmath58 could depend on the features of the reconstructed showers as well as on the experimental conditions ( pad dimension , shaping of the signals , multihit capability , etc . ) . by choosing @xmath82 about @xmath83 of the hits",
    "are rejected .",
    "increasing @xmath58 should increase the number of discarded hits without a significant improvement of the @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath84 distribution exhibits a long tail more pronounced for low multiplicity events . in these high @xmath84 events",
    "the time hits are considerably spread , by far more than expected from the detector time resolution .",
    "they can be attributed to the sampling of a portion of the shower affected by large time fluctuations .",
    "events with reduced @xmath85 @xmath86 ( @xmath87 of the total ) have been discarded and not used in the following analysis .",
    "since the shower size is not measured , events have been classified according to the observed particle density .",
    "the zenith angle distribution of the integral density spectrum is expected to follow an exponential behaviour i(,)=i(,0)e^ -x_0 ( sec-1 ) where @xmath88 is the vertical depth .",
    "the attenuation mean free path @xmath89 of eas is related to the absorption length @xmath90 of eas particles by @xmath91 where @xmath5 is the index of the integral density spectrum .",
    "the angular distribution of events with density greater than 3.0 particles/@xmath17 ( corresponding to @xmath92 = @xmath93 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ zenith ] .",
    "the data can be fit out to @xmath94 with an @xmath95 $ ] law .",
    "the parameter @xmath96 is found to be @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 @xmath4 , in excellent agreement with previous results concerning the density spectrum of shower particles @xcite . for angles greater than @xmath99 a deviation from this law",
    "is observed .",
    "misreconstructed events , showers locally produced in the walls of the sourrounding buildings and horizontal air showers could contribute to these large angle events .",
    "this result is substantially unchanged for densities ranging from 1 to 5 particles/@xmath17 .",
    "data confirm that the shape of the angular distribution is dominated by the physical effect of atmospheric absorption and that no relevant instrumental effects or selection biases have been introduced .",
    "the differential density spectrum measured in three different intervals of zenith angles is shown in fig .",
    "[ densthet ] .",
    "the angular bin size is @xmath100 , so that the difference of atmospheric depth inside the source bin is @xmath101 @xmath4 ( about one radiation length ) for zenith angles up to @xmath102 .",
    "a smaller bin size has been used to analyze data up to @xmath99 .",
    "the spectra refer to the depth corresponding to the mean zenith angle of the showers recorded inside each interval .",
    "the shapes of the spectra are very similar in the density range @xmath103 particles/@xmath17 not affected by threshold or saturation effects .",
    "the index @xmath104 of the density spectrum as a function of the zenith angle is shown in fig . [ spectra ] . a weighted mean up to @xmath105 gives @xmath106 .",
    "this value is fully consistent with the ones obtained in experiments at high altitude at comparable particle densities @xcite .",
    "montecarlo simulations show that present data concern energies ranging from about 1 tev ( quasi - vertical showers ) to a few hundred tev ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "accordingly , the measured @xmath104 can be considered a reasonable estimate of the slope of the density spectrum of showers initiated by primaries ( mainly protons ) of energies @xmath108 @xmath109 . from these data",
    "the absorption length of eas particles @xmath90 is found to be @xmath110 @xmath4 consistent with results of similar measurements at small shower sizes @xcite .",
    "data recorded at large zenith angles ( @xmath111 ) are due to showers developed through atmospheric depths greater than @xmath112 @xmath4 .",
    "thus , a substantial contribution is expected from showers originated by primaries of energies beyond the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "this could explain the increasing of the slope @xmath104 with zenith angle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "the time distribution of the shower hits with respect to the fitted plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ timethick ] for two different multiplicity ranges .",
    "quasi - vertical showers ( @xmath113 ) have been selected .",
    "the distribution of time residuals exhibits , as expected , a long tail due to time fluctuations and to the curved profile of the shower front , more pronounced for low multiplicity .",
    "the width of these distributions is related to the time thickness of the shower front .",
    "since the position of the shower core is not reconstructed , the experimental result concerns a time thickness averaged on different radial distances .    for low multiplicity events with a mean number of particles per pad @xmath114 , the spread @xmath81 represents a reasonable measurement of the shower thickness . for high multiplicity events ( @xmath115 ) , where the mean number of particles hitting one pad is @xmath116",
    ", this @xmath81 does not express the thickness of the shower disc without any bias .",
    "in fact , the time residual distribution is related to the fluctuations of the first particle detected by each pad . taking into account the total detector resolution of @xmath117 @xmath38 ( rpc intrinsic jitter , strip length , electronics time resolution ) the time jitter of the earliest particles in high multiplicity events ( @xmath118 hits )",
    "is estimated @xmath69 @xmath38 .",
    "the averaged shower front thickness of low multiplicity events ( particle density @xmath119 @xmath72 ) is found @xmath120 @xmath38 .",
    "the angular resolution of the carpet has been estimated by dividing the detector into two independent sub - arrays ( `` odd pads '' and `` even pads '' ) and comparing the two reconstructed shower directions .",
    "these two sub - arrays overlap spatially so that they are affected by the same shower curvature .",
    "events with total number of hits @xmath121 have been selected according to the constraint @xmath122 . the distribution of the even - odd angle difference @xmath123 is shown in fig .",
    "[ evenodd ] for events in different multiplicity ranges and @xmath124 .",
    "these distributions narrow , as expected , with increasing shower size .",
    "the effect of the lead sheet on the angular resolution can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ median ] , where the median @xmath125 of the distribution of @xmath123 as a function of pad multiplicity , for showers reconstructed before and after the lead was added , is shown .",
    "the improvement of the angular resolution is a factor @xmath0 1.4 for @xmath126 and decreases with increasing multiplicity .    assuming that the angular resolution function for the entire array is gaussian , its standard deviation @xmath81 is given by @xcite @xmath127 this chessboard method yields a standard deviation @xmath128 for events with a pad multiplicity @xmath129 .",
    "a carpet of @xmath0 50 @xmath17 of rpcs has been put in operation at the yangbajing laboratory in order to study the high altitude performance of rpcs and the detector capability of imaging with high granularity a small portion of the eas disc , in view of an enlarged use in tibet ( argo - ybj experiment ) .",
    "the results of this test confirm that rpcs can be operated efficiently ( @xmath130 ) to sample air showers at high altitude with excellent time resolution ( @xmath69 @xmath38 ) .",
    "the analysis of data collected with a shower trigger suggest that the rpcs carpet capability of reconstructing the shower features is consistent with expectations . as a conclusion , the overall results of the test look well promising for future operation of the full detector .",
