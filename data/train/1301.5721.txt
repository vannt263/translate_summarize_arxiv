    "the detection of scalar non - gaussianities not only breaks the degeneracy among many inflationary models , but it also offers the possibility to discriminate between the inflationary paradigm and other alternative scenarios ( such as curvaton @xcite ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there are several different shapes of non - gaussianities depending on the wave numbers @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 satisfying the condition @xmath3 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the simplest one is the so - called local shape , which has a peak in the squeezed limit ( i.e. , the limit where the modulus of the momenta approaches @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the second shape corresponds to the equilateral configuration with a peak at @xmath6 .",
    "a factorizable shape whose scalar product with the equilateral template vanishes is called the orthogonal one .",
    "there is another shape dubbed the enfolded one , which is a linear combination of the equilateral and orthogonal templates .    from the bispectrum @xmath7 of the three - point correlation function of curvature perturbations @xmath8 ,",
    "the non - linear parameter characterizing the strength of non - gaussianities is defined by @xmath9 . for purely adiabatic gaussian perturbations",
    "we have that @xmath10 , but the presence of non - gaussian perturbations leads to the deviation from @xmath10 .",
    "the wmap 9 year data provide the following bounds on the non - linear parameters of local , equilateral , and orthogonal non - gaussianities , respectively @xcite : @xmath11 since the non - linear parameter of the enfolded shape is given by @xmath12 @xcite , we obtain the following bounds from eqs .",

    "creminelli and zaldarriaga @xcite pointed out that the same non - gaussianity consistency relation holds for any single - field model under the condition that only one mode of curvature perturbations survives after the hubble radius crossing while the other one decays ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for related works ) .    in the context of single - field k - inflation @xcite ,",
    "the bispectrum of curvature perturbations was first derived by seery and lidsey in 2005 @xcite .",
    "since the scalar propagation speed squared @xmath16 can be much smaller than 1 @xcite , it is possible to realize the large equilateral non - linear parameter @xmath17 . if we naively take the squeezed limit for the leading - order bispectrum derived in refs .",
    "@xcite , the term proportional to @xmath18 does not disappear .",
    "this comes from the fact that the slow - variation corrections to the bispectrum need to be taken into account to estimate the local - type non - gaussianity correctly .",
    "in fact , chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the maldacena s consistency relation is recovered in the squeezed limit by carefully computing all the possible slow - variation corrections to the leading - order bispectrum .",
    "thus the slow - variation single - field k - inflation models with @xmath19 lead to small local non - gaussianities , even though the equilateral non - linear parameter can be large .    in the horndeski",
    "s most general scalar - tensor theories with second - order equations of motion @xcite , the leading - order three - point correlation function of curvature perturbations was derived on the quasi de sitter background @xcite ( see refs .",

    "@xcite for the bispectrum of tensor perturbations in the horndeski s theories ) .",
    "although the result is valid for the estimation of the equilateral non - linear parameter , the bispectrum is not general enough to be used for any shape of non - gaussianities . in this paper",
    "we take into account all the possible slow - variation corrections to the leading - order bispectrum in the horndeski s theories .",
    "not only we reproduce the maldacena s consistency relation in the squeezed limit , but we identify the shape close to the squeezed one at which the term @xmath18 begins to contribute to the bispectrum .    given our general expression of the bispectrum in the most general single - field scalar - tensor theories , we can evaluate the non - linear parameters of several different shapes to confront each inflationary model with observations .",
    "in particular the result @xmath20 is robust for any slow - variation single - field model , so the detection of non - gaussianities in the squeezed limit will allow us to falsify the slow - variation single - field scenario .",
    "note that in realistic observations the shape is not completely squeezed , in which case the bispectrum can be affected by the appearance of the term @xmath18 mentioned above .",
    "our results are useful to distinguish such difference accurately .    if @xmath19 , then the non - linear parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 can be much larger than the order of 1 .",
    "which shape dominates over the other ones depends on the models of inflation . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the correlation between the equilateral template and the shapes arising from the horndeski s theories is quite high , but linear combinations of equilateral operators can give rise to a significantly different shape for a wide range of coefficients @xcite . in",
    "this regard we anticipate that there may be some models in which the shape orthogonal to the equilateral template provides an important contribution to the bispectrum .    in this paper",
    "we show that the leading - order three - point correlation function in the horndeski s theories can be expressed by a linear combination of two bases whose shapes are highly correlated with equilateral and orthogonal shapes respectively .",
    "this decomposition is useful because the contributions from the equilateral and orthogonal shapes can be easily estimated for concrete models of inflation .",
    "we show that in k - inflation with the covariant galileon terms there are cases in which the correlations with the orthogonal and enfolded templates are larger than that with the equilateral one .",

    "in the horndeski s most general scalar - tensor theories we derived the three - point correlation function of primordial curvature perturbations generated during inflation in the presence of slow - variation corrections to the leading - order bispectrum . unlike previous works @xcite , the bispectrum ( [ calafi ] ) is valid for any shape of non - gaussianities at first order of @xmath58 .    in the squeezed limit ( @xmath470 , @xmath471 ) the leading - order bispectrum ( [ ale ] ) vanishes , so that the correction ( [ aco ] ) is the dominant contribution to @xmath134 . by using eq .",
    "( [ aco ] ) , we showed that the non - linear parameter in this limit is given by @xmath472 .",
    "this agrees with the result of refs .",
    "@xcite in which the three - point correlation function was derived by dealing with the long - wavelength curvature perturbation ( mode @xmath473 ) as a classical background . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this result should be valid for any single - field inflation in which the decaying mode of @xmath8 is neglected relative to the growing mode .",
    "our direct computation of the three - point correlation function in the presence of all possible slow - variation corrections is another independent proof that the non - gaussianity consistency relation holds for most general single - field theories with second - order equations of motion .",
    "the result of the local non - gaussianities shows that @xmath474 is much smaller than 1 , e.g. , @xmath475 for @xmath476 . in the case",
    "where the shape of non - gaussianities is not exactly the squeezed one ( @xmath477 ) , the leading - order bispectrum gives the non - linear parameter @xmath478 .",
    "hence the leading - order term dominates over the correction for @xmath479 . for the models with @xmath274",
    "the non - linear parameter can be as large as @xmath480 with the growth of @xmath481 . by measuring the shape",
    "which is not so squeezed , it should be possible to discriminate the models with different values of @xmath393 .",
    "the leading - order non - linear parameters in the equilateral and enfolded limits are given by eqs .",

    "these results will be useful to constrain concrete models of inflation in future high - precision observations .",
    "we also showed that the leading - order bispectrum can be expressed in terms of the sum of the two bases @xmath333 and @xmath334 .",
    "the shape @xmath333 is very highly correlated with the equilateral template ( [ sequilateral ] ) .",
    "it also vanishes in both local and enfolded limits .",

    "[ concretesec ] we presented concrete models in which the orthogonal shape can provide important contributions to the bispectrum . in power - law k - inflation the shape of non - gaussianities is well approximated by the equilateral type .",
    "however , in k - inflation described by the lagrangian @xmath482 with a number of different galileon terms like @xmath483 and @xmath484 , we found that the orthogonal contribution is crucially important for @xmath274 . in the presence of the term @xmath484 ,",
    "the correlations with the orthogonal and enfolded templates in the regime @xmath274 are higher than that with the equilateral template",
    ".    it will be interesting to see how the observations such as planck @xcite provide the constraints on the scalar non - gaussianities as well as the scalar spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "in particular , if future observations confirm the value @xmath485 at more than 95%cl , this implies that we need to go beyond the slow - variation single - field inflationary scenario ( including the horndeski s theories ) .",
    "the information of other shapes of non - gaussianities ( including the not so squeezed one ) will be useful to discriminate between many different models .",

    "<S> in the horndeski s most general scalar - tensor theories , we derive the three - point correlation function of scalar non - gaussianities generated during single - field inflation in the presence of slow - variation corrections to the leading - order term . unlike previous works , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting bispectrum is valid for any shape of non - gaussianities . in the squeezed limit , </S>",
    "<S> for example , this gives rise to the same consistency relation as that derived by maldacena in standard single - field slow - roll inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the shape close to the squeezed one at which the effect of the term inversely proportional to the scalar propagation speed squared begins to contribute to the bispectrum . we also show that the leading - order bispectrum can be expressed by the linear combination of two convenient bases whose shapes </S>",
    "<S> are highly correlated with equilateral and orthogonal types respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we present concrete models in which the orthogonal and enfolded shapes can dominate over the equilateral one . </S>"
