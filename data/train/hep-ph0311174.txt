    "understanding the spin structure of the proton is one of the most challenging problems facing subatomic physics : how is the spin of the proton built up out from the intrinsic spin and orbital angular momentum of its quark and gluonic constituents ?",

    "key issues include the role of polarized glue and gluon topology in building up the spin of the proton .",
    "our present knowledge about the spin structure of the nucleon comes from polarized deep inelastic scattering .",

    ", these experiments have been interpreted to imply a small value for the flavour - singlet axial - charge : @xmath3 this result is particularly interesting @xcite because @xmath4 is interpreted in the parton model as the fraction of the proton s spin which is carried by the intrinsic spin of its quark and antiquark constituents .",
    "the value ( [ eqa1 ] ) is about half the prediction of relativistic constituent quark models ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "it corresponds to a negative strange - quark polarization @xmath6 ( polarized in the opposite direction to the spin of the proton ) .",
    "the small value of @xmath7 extracted from polarized deep inelastic scattering has inspired vast experimental and theoretical activity to understand the spin structure of the proton .",
    "new experiments are underway or being planned to map out the proton s spin - flavour structure and to measure the amount of spin carried by polarized gluons in the polarized proton .",
    "these include semi - inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering , polarized proton - proton collisions at rhic @xcite , and polarized @xmath8 collider studies @xcite .",
    "experiments at jlab will map out the valence region at large bjorken @xmath2 ( close to one ) @xcite .",
    "an independent , weak interaction , measurement of @xmath4 could be performed using elastic neutrino proton scattering @xcite .",
    "experiments with transversely polarized targets are just beginning and promise to reveal new information about the spin structure of the proton including tests of the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule for the nucleon s @xmath9 spin structure function and measurements of a whole new family of `` transversity observables '' .",
    "the plan of these lectures is as follows .",
    "we first summarise the phenomenology of the proton spin problem , including possible gluonic contributions .",
    "next , in sections 2 and 3 , we give an overview of the derivation of the spin sum rules for polarized photon nucleon scattering , detailing the assumptions that are made at each step . here",
    "we explain how these sum rules could be affected by potential subtraction constants ( subtractions at infinity ) in the dispersion relations for the spin dependent part of the forward compton amplitude .",
    "we next give a brief review of fixed pole contributions to deep inelastic scattering in section 4 .",
    "fixed poles are well known to play a vital role in the adler sum rule for w - boson nucleon scattering @xcite and the schwinger term sum rule for the longitudinal structure function measured in unpolarized deep inelastic @xmath8 scattering @xcite .",
    "we explain how fixed poles could , in principle , affect the sum rules for the first moments of the @xmath1 and @xmath9 spin structure functions . for example , a subtraction constant correction to the ellis - jaffe sum rule for the first moment of the nucleon s @xmath1 spin dependent structure function would follow if there is a real constant term in the spin dependent part of the forward deeply virtual compton scattering amplitude .",
    "section 5 discusses the qcd axial anomaly and its manifestation in @xmath4 and the spin structure of the proton .",
    "we conjecture that gluon topology may induce a @xmath0 fixed pole correction to the ellis - jaffe sum rule .",
    "photon - gluon fusion and its importance to semi - inclusive measurements of sea polarization in polarized deep inelastic scattering are disussed in section 6 .",

    "first consider the flavour - singlet channel .",
    "in qcd the axial anomaly @xcite induces gluonic contributions to the flavour - singlet axial charge associated with the polarized glue in the nucleon and with gluon topology .    1 .",
    "the first moment of the @xmath1 spin structure function for polarized photon - gluon fusion @xmath10 receives a negative contribution @xmath11 from @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the quark transverse momentum relative to the photon gluon direction and @xmath14 is the virtuality of the hard photon @xcite .",
    "it also receives a positive contribution ( proportional to the mass squared of the struck quark or antiquark ) from low values of @xmath13 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the virtuality of the parent gluon and @xmath17 is the mass of the struck quark .",
    "the contact interaction ( @xmath18 ) between the polarized photon and gluon is flavour - independent , associated with the qcd axial anomaly and measures the spin of the target gluon .",
    "the mass dependent contribution is absorbed into the quark wavefunction of the nucleon .",
    "gluon topology is associated with gluonic boundary conditions and has the potential to induce a topological contribution to @xmath4 associated with bjorken @xmath2 equal to zero : topological @xmath19 polarization or , essentially , a spin polarized condensate inside a nucleon @xcite .",
    "putting this physics together leads to the formula @xcite : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the amount of spin carried by polarized gluon partons in the polarized proton and @xmath22 measures the spin carried by quarks and antiquarks carrying `` soft '' transverse momentum @xmath23 ; @xmath24 denotes the topological contribution . since @xmath25 under qcd evolution , the polarized gluon term @xmath26 $ ] in eq.([eqa3 ] ) scales as @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "understanding the transverse momentum dependence of the quark and gluon contributions in eq.([eqa3 ] ) is essential to ensure that theory and experimental acceptance are correctly matched when extracting information from semi - inclusive measurements aimed at disentangling the individual valence , sea and gluonic contributions @xcite .",
    "since @xmath19 is inaccessible to deep inelastic scattering , the deep inelastic measurement of @xmath4 , eq.([eqa1 ] ) , is not necessarily inconsistent with the constituent quark model prediction 0.6 _ if _ a substantial fraction of the spin of the constituent quark is associated with gluon topology in the transition from constituent to current quarks ( measured in polarized deep inelastic scattering ) through dynamical axial u(1 ) symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "an `` @xmath19 '' correction to deep inelastic measurements of @xmath4 would also follow if there is a leading twist `` subtraction at infinity '' in the dispersion relation for the spin dependent part of the forward compton scattering amplitude ( from a @xmath0 regge fixed pole ) .",
    "an independent measurement of the flavour - singlet axial - charge through elastic neutrino proton scattering would be extremely valuable .      quark model predictions for @xmath1 work much better in the isovector channel .",
    "the bjorken sum rule which relates the first moment of @xmath28 to the isovector axial charge @xmath29 measured in neutron beta decays has been confirmed at the level of 10% @xcite .",
    "looking beyond the first moment , the shape of @xmath28 is very interesting .",
