    "neutrinos are the only massless fermions predicted by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable assumption as none of the experiments designed to measure the neutrino mass in laboratory experiments have found any positive evidence for a non - zero neutrino mass . at present",
    "the existing limits from laboratory searches are  @xcite : @xmath0 the square of the electron neutrino mass is measured in tritium beta decay experiments by fitting the end point distribution . in several of these experiments there has been found a negative mass squared which is concluded to be due to unknown effects which cause the accumulation of events near the endpoint .",
    "this makes the limit above still far from certain .",
    "the muon neutrino mass limit is derived from the measurement of the muon neutrino momenta on the decay @xmath1 , while the tau neutrino mass limit given above is based on kinematics of @xmath2 decays . for a detail discussion on the @xmath2 neutrino mass limit see @xcite .    however , the confidence on the masslessness of the neutrino is now under question due to the important results of underground experiments , starting by the geochemical experiments of davis and collaborators till the more recent gallex , sage , kamiokande and superkamiokande experiments @xcite .",
    "altogether they provide solid evidence for the existence of anomalies in the solar and the atmospheric neutrino fluxes .",
    "particularly relevant has been the recent confirmation by the superkamiokande collaboration @xcite of the atmospheric neutrino zenith - angle - dependent deficit which strongly indicates towards the existence of @xmath3 conversion . together with these results",
    "there is also the indication for neutrino oscillations in the @xmath4 channel by the lsnd experiment  @xcite .",
    "if one tries to include all these requirements in a single framework , we finds three mass scales involved in neutrino oscillations .",
    "the simplest way to reconcile these requirements invokes the existence of a light sterile neutrino i.e. one whose interaction with standard model particles is much weaker than the sm weak interaction so it does not affect the invisible z decay width , precisely measured at lep @xcite . to this",
    "we may add the possible role of neutrinos in the dark matter problem and structure formation @xcite .",
    "at the moment , evidence for a solar neutrino deficit comes from four experiments @xcite , homestake , kamiokande , gallex and sage experiments .",
    "the most recent data on the rates can be summarized as : @xmath5 the different experiments are sensitive to different parts of the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos and putting all these results together seems to indicate that the solution to the problem is not astrophysical but must concern the neutrino properties . moreover , non - standard astrophysical solutions are strongly constrained by helioseismology studies @xcite . within the standard solar model approach , the theoretical predictions clearly lie far from the best - fit solution what leads us to conclude that new particle physics is the only way to account for the data .    the standard explanation for this deficit would be the oscillation of @xmath6 to another neutrino species either active or sterile .",
    "different analyses have been performed to find the allowed mass differences and mixing angles in the two - flavour approximation @xcite .",
    "the last result from refs .",
    "@xcite indicate that for oscillations into active neutrinos there are three possible solutions for the parameters : +    * vacuum ( also called `` just so '' ) oscillations with @xmath7@xmath8 ev@xmath9 and @xmath10@xmath11 * non - adiabatic - matter - enhanced oscillations via the msw mechanism @xcite with @xmath12@xmath13 ev@xmath9 and @xmath14@xmath15 , and * large mixing via the msw mechanism with @xmath16@xmath17 ev@xmath9 and @xmath18@xmath11 .    in fig .",
    "[ msw ] i show the allowed two - flavour regions obtained in an updated msw global fit analysis of the solar neutrino data for the case of active neutrino conversions .",
    "the analysis uses the model from @xcite but with an arbitrary @xmath19 ( from the reaction @xmath20 ) neutrino flux  @xcite .",
    "[ vac98 ] shows the regions of just - so oscillation parameters obtained in a recent global fit of the data .",
    "it has been pointed out that the expected seasonal effects in this scenario ( due to the variation of the earth - sun distance ) could be used to further constrain the parameters @xcite , and also to help discriminating it from the msw transition .    for oscillations into an sterile neutrino",
    "there are differences partly due to the fact that now the survival probability depends both on the electron and neutron density in the sun but mainly due to the lack of neutral current contribution to the kamiokande experiment .",
    "this last effect requires a larger @xmath6 survival probability . as a result",
    "the vacuum oscillation solution is very marginal and the large mixing msw solution is ruled out .",
    "the small mixing solution is still valid @xcite .",
    "the large mixing solution for oscillations into sterile neutrinos is also in conflict with the constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .",
    "the presence of additional weakly interacting light particles , such as a light sterile neutrino , is constrained by bbn since the @xmath21 would enter into equilibrium with the active neutrinos in the early universe via neutrino oscillations .",
    "however the derivation of the bbn bounds may be subject to large systematical uncertainties .",
    "for example , it has been argued in  @xcite that present observations of primordial helium and deuterium abundances can allow up to @xmath22 neutrino species if the baryon to photon ratio is small .",
    "the presence of a relic lepton number asymmetry in the early universe may also relax this constraint @xcite .",
    "atmospheric showers are initiated when primary cosmic rays hit the earth s atmosphere .",
    "secondary mesons produced in this collision , mostly pions and kaons , decay and give rise to electron and muon neutrino and anti - neutrinos fluxes @xcite .",
    "there has been a long - standing anomaly between the predicted and observed @xmath3 @xmath23 ratio of the atmospheric neutrino fluxes @xcite . although the absolute individual @xmath3 or @xmath6 fluxes are only known to within @xmath24 accuracy , different authors agree that the @xmath3 @xmath23 ratio is accurate up to a @xmath25 precision . in this",

    "the most important feature of the atmospheric neutrino 535-day   data  sample reported by the sk  collaboration at neutrino  98  @xcite is that it exhibits a _",
    "zenith - angle - dependent _ deficit of muon neutrinos which is inconsistent with expectations based on calculations of the atmospheric neutrino fluxes .",

    "it has been used the latest improved calculations of the atmospheric neutrino fluxes as a function of zenith angle , including the muon polarization effect and took into account a variable neutrino production point @xcite .",
    "clearly the data are not reproduced by the no - oscillation hypothesis , adding substantially to our confidence that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is real .",
    "the most likely solution of the ana involves neutrino oscillations @xcite . in principle",

    "this follows from looking at the relation between mixing _ in vacuo _ and in matter .",
    "in fact , away from the resonance region , independently of the sign of the matter potential , there is a suppression of the mixing inside the earth . as a result",

    "the first point to note is that the chooz reactor @xcite data already excludes the region indicated for the @xmath37 channel when all experiments are combined at 90% cl . from the upper - left panel in fig .",
    "[ mutausk4 ] one sees that the regions of @xmath28 oscillation parameters obtained from the atmospheric neutrino data analysis can not be fully tested by the lbl experiments , as presently designed .",
    "one might expect that , due to the upward shift of the @xmath35 indicated by the fit for the sterile case ( due to the effects of matter in the earth ) it would be possible to completely cover the corresponding region of oscillation parameters .",
    "although this is the case for the minos disappearance test , in general most of the lbl experiments can not completely probe the region of oscillation parameters allowed by the @xmath38 atmospheric neutrino analysis .",

    "stable neutrinos can fill the universe of hot dark matter if their masses add up to a maximum of about 30 ev .",
    "however , scenarios with only hot dark matter run into trouble in the explanation of the formation of structures on small scales of the universe .",
    "the research on the nature of the cosmological dark matter and the origin of galaxies and large scale structure in the universe within the standard theoretical framework of gravitational collapse of fluctuations as the origin of structure in the expanding universe has undergone tremendous progress recently .",
    "indeed the observations of cosmic background temperature anisotropies on large scales performed by the cobe satellite @xcite combined with cluster - cluster correlation data e.g. from iras  @xcite can not be reconciled with the simplest cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .    currently , the best scenario for a zero cosmological constant to explain the data considers a mixture of cold plus hot dark matter @xcite .",

    "actually the results indicate , for a flat universe , @xmath64 at 99 % cl .    should these results be confirmed the amount of dark matter of the universe would be considerably reduced and in consequence the corresponding limit on the stable neutrino mass will become tighter .",
    "future sky maps of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) with high precision at the upcoming map and planck missions should bring more light into the nature of the dark matter and the possible role of neutrinos .",
    "naive two - family counting shows that it is very difficult to fit all experimental information even in the three neutrino scenario , even without invoking the lsnd data .",
    "one has to choose between throwing away part of the data and considering a larger scheme .",
    "the solar neutrino deficit could be due to @xmath65 oscillations and the atmospheric neutrino deficit to @xmath66 oscillations with the appropriate mass differences , for example with a mass hierarchy @xmath67 .",
    "however , fitting this together with the present laboratory limits leaves no room for hot dark @xcite .",
    "the only possible way out is to require that all three neutrinos are almost degenerate .",
    "this requires a certain degree of fine - tuning in order to explain the neutrinoless double beta decay data .",
    "notice that this scenario is also inconsistent with the oscillation parameters observed by lsnd .",
    "one could have @xmath68 oscillations for the atmospheric neutrino deficit with almost degenerate @xmath3 and @xmath29 with masses @xmath69 few ev and @xmath70 , but leaving out the explanation for the solar neutrino deficit . or @xmath71 and @xmath72 few ev to explain the atmospheric data but leaving unexplained both solar neutrino deficit and dark matter .    also , it is possible to explain the solar neutrino deficit with @xmath73 with almost degenerate @xmath6 and @xmath74 with masses @xmath75 few ev and @xmath76 , but leaving the atmospheric neutrino deficit unexplained . also @xmath77 and @xmath78 ev would explain the lsnd data if confirmed but leaves both atmospheric and dark matter without explanation .",
    "the  minimal \" scheme to explain @xmath79 data without fine - tuning seems to be a four - neutrino framework @xmath80 where @xmath21 is a sterile neutrino .",
    "the simplest way to open the possibility of incorporating the lsnd scale to the solar and atmospheric neutrino scales is to invoke a sterile neutrino , i.e. one whose interaction with standard model particles is much weaker than the sm weak interaction so it does not affect the invisible z decay width , precisely measured at lep .",
    "the sterile neutrino must also be light enough in order to participate in the oscillations involving the three active neutrinos @xcite .",
    "after imposing the present constrains from the negative searches at accelerator @xcite and reactor @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments one is left with two possible mass patterns as described in fig .",
    "[ masses ] which i will call scenario i and ii .",
    "in scenario i there are two lighter neutrinos at the solar neutrino mass scale and two maximally mixed almost degenerate ev - mass neutrinos split by the atmospheric neutrino scale . in scenario ii the two lighter neutrinos are maximally mixed and split by the atmospheric neutrino scale while the two heavier neutrinos are almost degenerate separated by the solar neutrino mass difference . in both scenarios solar neutrino data together with reactor neutrino constrains , imply that the electron neutrino must be maximally projected over one of the states belonging to the pair split by the solar neutrino scale : the lighter ( heavier ) pair for scenario i ( ii ) . on the other hand , atmospheric neutrino data together with the bounds from accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments imply that the muon neutrino must be maximally projected over the pair split by the atmospheric neutrino mass difference : the heavier ( lighter ) pair for scenario i ( ii ) .    in both scenarios",
    "there are two possible assignments for the sterile and tau neutrinos which i denote by .a and .b depending on whether the tau neutrino is maximally projected over the pair responsible for the atmospheric neutrino oscillations and the sterile neutrino is responsible for the solar neutrino deficit ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) or viceversa ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) .",
    "these four possibilities offer different signatures at future experiments :    * in scenario ii the electron neutrino must be mainly composed of one of the heavier states with a mass characteristic of the lsnd mass difference and the dark matter @xmath85 and may be tested at future neutrinoless double-@xmath86 decay and tritium @xmath86 decay experiments . * as mentioned before in the atmospheric neutrino section , scenarios i.a and ii.a give a slightly better fit to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "future long baseline experiments can be sensitive to this oscillation and the most sensitive test would be a @xmath2 appearance experiment . *",
    "scenarios i.b and ii.b where the atmospheric @xmath3 deficit is due to the oscillation into an sterile neutrino imply a higher value of @xmath87 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ mutausk4 ] due to the effect of propagation through the earth which suppresses the lower mass region . as a consequence",
    "this scenario can be easier to test at future long baseline experiments .",
    "however only a disappearance - type experiment is possible and , in general these tests can achieve lower sensitivity . * for solar neutrinos",
    "the three regions discussed in subsection [ solar ] are valid for scenarios i.a and ii.a when the solar data is explained in terms of @xmath88 . for scenarios i.b and ii.b where @xmath89 are invoked to account for the solar neutrino deficit , there are differences mainly due to the lack of neutral current contribution to the kamiokande experiment .",
    "this last effect requires a larger @xmath6 survival probability . as a result",
    "the vacuum oscillation solution is very marginal and the large mixing msw solution is ruled out . * the neutral - to - charged current ratio is a very important observable in neutrino oscillation phenomenology , which is especially sensitive to the existence of singlet neutrinos .",
    "this test can be carried out both at future solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments as well as long baseline experiments . at present",
    "one may study the ratios of @xmath90-events and the events induced mainly by the charged currents  @xcite .",
    "superkamiokande has reported the result @xcite @xmath91 the expected values are 1 .",
    "( 0.75 ) for scenarios i.a and ii.a ( i.b and ii.b ) .",
    "the result above is consistent with both scenarios with a slight preference for the former . * in scenarios i.b and ii.b the sterile neutrino is largely mixed with one active neutrino .",
    "this gives a larger contribution to the effective degrees of freedom at the time of bbn .",
    "should the bbn constrains become more precise , these scenarios may be ruled out .",
    "the impressive re - confirmation of an angle - dependent atmospheric neutrino deficit by superkamiokande leaves little room for doubt that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is an strong evidence for neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "likewise , it has become more and more difficult to avoid neutrino oscillations as an explanation for the solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "also the lsnd evidence for @xmath42-@xmath40-oscillations still remains a viable hypothesis although more restricted by the exclusion limit of the karmen experiment .",
    "these three results can be interpreted in terms of neutrino oscillations but with the need of three different mass scales .",
    "thus if the lsnd result stands the test of time , this would be a puzzling indication for the existence of a light sterile neutrino .",
    "the two scenarios to reconcile these observations invoke either @xmath88 oscillations to explain the solar data , with @xmath92 oscillations accounting for the atmospheric deficit , or viceversa .",
    "they have distinct implications at future tritium beta decay and neutrino - less double beta decay experiments as well as solar , atmospheric and long baseline neutrino experiments .",
    "in particular the neutral - to - charged current ratio is an important observable to discriminate among the different scenarios as it is sensitive to the existence of singlet neutrinos .",
    "this test can be carried out both at future solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments as well as long baseline experiments . *",
