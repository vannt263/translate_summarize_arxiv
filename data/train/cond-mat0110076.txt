    "since the first experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in trapped atomic gases , a number of papers have highlighted the parallels between processes in atom optics and nonlinear ( photon ) optics .",
    "well - known examples include four - wave mixing @xcite and soliton dynamics @xcite , while the squeezing of matter wave fields has also been examined @xcite .",
    "these latter studies consider the way in which the nonlinear interactions between the atoms can generate entangled atomic beams , for example by spin - exchanging collisions of spinor bose - einstein condensates .    entangled states , to which squeezed states are closely related , have been extensively studied in the last few years because of their potential application in quantum information processing and quantum computing . in this paper , we discuss squeezing and entanglement in terms of the quasiparticle modes of a trapped gas .",
    "quasiparticle modes represent collective excitations of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , and are in fact one of the most fundamental features of its dynamics .",
    "they are easily generated by applying time - dependent perturbations to the trapping potential , and were observed experimentally quite early on ; they have since been studied in some detail both theoretically and experimentally .    the low temperature regime in which the majority of the atoms are in the condensate has been studied in various experiments @xcite .",
    "these experiments revealed oscillations of the condensate with almost no damping , and the results were in good agreement with predictions based on the zero temperature gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite .",
    "excitations at higher temperatures were studied in later experiments @xcite , where large energy shifts and rapid damping rates were observed .",
    "while the standard theory of elementary excitations due to bogoliubov @xcite explains most of the observed effects , it can not account for higher - order processes , such as the beliaev damping . and",
    "while finite temperature studies using the gpe have explained various properties of becs observed experimentally , they can not fully describe the evolution of collective excitations at higher temperatures @xcite since the spontaneous part of the beliaev damping of the excitations is not included .",
    "theoretical techniques have recently been developed that take the quasiparticle interactions into account @xcite and experiments to test the predictions are planned for the near future .",
    "the main motivation of the present paper is to analyse these experiments on the quantal aspects of quasiparticle mode evolution in a bec .",
    "we note that beliaev damping may be understood in terms of a nonlinear frequency - mixing mechanism in which a bogoliubov quasiparticle of frequency @xmath1 interacts with the ground state ( condensate ) and generates two quasiparticles of frequency @xmath2 that divide the initial energy equally ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] ) .",
    "the mechanism is actually based on a four - wave process that masquerades as a three - wave interaction analogous to optical parametric down - conversion ( opdc ) in which a photon in a nonlinear medium splits into two photons of lower energy .",
    "we calculate the amount of squeezing for a realistic system containing 10000 @xmath3rb atoms in a trap with spherical geometry .",
    "we also propose an alternative method for determining the temperature of a bec well below the critical temperature by observing the variation of the envelope of the collective excitations .",
    "this should be more accurate than current techniques based on fitting a thermal gaussian profile to the atomic cloud .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] , we describe the higher - order hamiltonian that accommodates processes such as landau and beliaev damping in the quasiparticle excitations .",
    "we derive equations of motion for a quasiparticle mode . in section [ sec : pdc ] , we make quantitative estimates for the degree of squeezing and entanglement in quasiparticle excitations .",
    "in addition we calculate the expected `` damping rate '' and coupling between modes at various temperatures which can then serve as a temperature measurement calibration for ultracold atoms . a possible way of detecting squeezed states in atom optics is discussed briefly in section [ sec : experiment ] .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian for a system of bosons with pairwise interactions can be written in the usual second quantised formalism as , @xmath4 where the matrix elements @xmath5 are given by @xmath6    here , @xmath7 is the single - particle hamiltonian with a confining potential @xmath8 , and the basis state wave functions are @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the matrix element for the interaction potential @xmath11 between atoms .",
    "the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the creation and annihilation operators for mode @xmath14 that obey the usual bose commutation relations @xmath15=\\delta_{ij},\\text{\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ }    [ \\hat a_i,\\hat a_j]=[\\hat a_i^{\\dag},\\hat a_j^{\\dag}]=0.\\nonumber\\ ] ]    the hamiltonian ( [ eq : bareh ] ) is written in a single - particle basis where the operator @xmath16 annihilates a particle from the state with wave function @xmath17 .",
    "the wave function @xmath18 describes the condensate , while the remaining functions form a complete set orthogonal to the condensate .",
    "we follow the standard procedure and rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ eq : bareh ] ) in powers of @xmath19 by replacing the operator @xmath20 with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total number of atoms in the trap and @xmath23 is the number of excited atoms . the quadratic part of the hamiltonian can be diagonalised exactly using the standard bogoliubov transformation @xcite , which allows us to write the hamiltonian in a quasiparticle basis .",
    "the quasiparticle operators @xmath24 are defined by @xmath25 where the matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which depend on temperature and the trap geometry , are calculated numerically using the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the non - quadratic terms , which affect the energy and shape of the condensate , are expected to be small and hence dealt with perturbatively .",
    "we can , therefore , calculate the quasiparticle shifts and widths at zero and finite temperature .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the effective hamiltonian can be written in terms of the quasiparticle operator @xmath28 as    @xmath29+h.c .",
    "\\right\\ } ,    \\label{eq : h3}\\ ] ]    in which only processes that generally conserve energy have been included .",
    "the constant term in the equation simply defines the zero of energy and @xmath30 is the energy shift from first order perturbation theory .",
    "the coefficients @xmath31 are determined by    @xmath32\\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\langle mn|v|q0 \\rangle \\left [ u_{in}^ * u_{jq } v_{km}+u_{im}^ *    v_{jn } u_{kq}+v_{iq}^ * v_{jn } v_{km } \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 are labels that denote the quasiparticle energy levels . for a 3-d condensate , the index @xmath14 stands for the quantum numbers @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we note that the coefficients are temperature dependent through @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian given by equation ( [ eq : h3 ] ) contains terms beyond the standard bogoliubov approximation , thus we are using a fuller description of the bec that involves _ interacting _ quasiparticles and can take important processes such as landau and beliaev damping into account .",
    "beliaev processes occur at zero temperature and are dominant in the low - temperature regime .",
    "landau processes on the other hand predominate at higher temperatures ; these processes , in which two quasiparticles collide to form a single quasiparticle can not occur at zero temperature because there are no excited quasiparticles .    from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h3 ] ) , the heisenberg equations of motion for @xmath37 and @xmath38 are    @xmath39    where @xmath40    it is well known that homogeneous systems have a continuous spectrum of excitations ; however , for a trapped system , the spectrum of states to which the excitation can couple is discrete .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a spherical trap there is a degeneracy in the azimuthal quantum number @xmath36 , which in turn means that fewer resonances are present @xcite .",
    "this implies that the time evolution of the excitation is dominated by a strong coupling to only a few modes . on the other hand ,",
    "the geometry of the trap can be changed by adjusting the frequencies in the radial and axial directions independently , and the selection of a dominant mode in this way has been demonstrated @xcite . in particular , a beliaev process has recently been observed for a scissors mode , where one mode is resonantly coupled to two modes of half the original frequency @xcite ; this is the kind of process that we seek to model in the present paper .",
    "the equations of motion for modes @xmath41 in a beliaev process reduce to @xmath42 where we have used the fact that @xmath43 , and we have chosen the phases so that the coefficients are real .",
    "equations of the form ( [ eq : twomodes1])-([eq : twomodes2 ] ) have been studied in quantum optics and we apply them here to study the squeezing in the quasiparticle excitations and its temperature dependence .",
    "we note that damping of quasiparticle excitations has earlier been described in terms of nonlinear mixing of quasiparticle modes @xcite ; however , the present work is quite distinct as the operator nature of the quasiparticle annihilation operator @xmath28 is retained , and the calculation is not restricted to the quadratic approximation .",
    "we are therefore extending the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , so that spontaneous quantum processes are included .",
    "to give an idea of the order of magnitude of the numbers involved , the coefficient @xmath44 equals @xmath45 in trap units for the following parameters : @xmath46 nk , @xmath47 , @xmath48 hz , for a spherical trap geometry and using @xmath3rb atoms for which the s - wave scattering length @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the bohr radius .",
    "the values of @xmath44 are significantly dependent on temperature ; which implies that the equations of motion for @xmath51 and @xmath52 are altered accordingly .",
    "we can exploit this feature as a method of measuring temperature below @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ fig : tb ] indicates the dependence of @xmath44 on temperature , which is an effective dependence on the number of particles in the condensate .",
    "we notice that at higher temperatures the coefficient decreases swiftly , whilst for lower temperatures it is fairly constant .",
    "we consider first the case where the higher ( @xmath54 ) mode - the pump - has a much larger population than the lower one and where the pump depletion is ignored so that the operator @xmath55 can be approximated by a c - number @xmath56 .",
    "physically , this would represent a situation in which the higher mode is being continuously driven by a resonant excitation .",
    "the solutions of the equations of motion for @xmath51 and @xmath57 in the interaction picture are then given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and we have chosen the phases such that the coefficients are real . this approximation neglects the depletion of the `` pump '' and the solution will cease to be valid once appreciable down - conversion occurs .",
    "solutions ( [ eq : solution ] ) are formally equivalent to equations that describe degenerate parametric down conversion in quantum optics : a process known to be a significant source of squeezed states . in our case the squeezing parameter is given by    @xmath60    which is temperature dependent through @xmath61 .",
    "defining the quadrature operators as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we have the variances @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of particles in mode 1 . in optics ,",
    "the quadrature operators are well - defined quantities corresponding to the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic ( em ) oscillation .",
    "one may think of the amplitude and ( temporal ) phase of oscillations in a quasiparticle excitation , in a similar way , and we therefore interpret our quadrature operators @xmath66 and @xmath67 as amplitude and phase of oscillations . equations ( [ eq : x1 ] ) and ( [ eq : x2 ] ) imply that the degree of squeezing depends on the amount of the lower - mode atoms present .",
    "this is directly related to the temperature of the ultracold atoms in the condensate @xcite , defined in terms of the initial bose - einstein ( be ) distribution of quasiparticles .",
    "surface plots of @xmath68 and @xmath69 are shown in figures [ fig : varianzas ] a ) and b ) . at @xmath70 the behaviour of the variances",
    "is determined by the be distribution function for mode @xmath71 . at higher temperatures , the behaviour of the coefficient @xmath44 dominates the trend .",
    "experimentally , what is of interest is correlation functions such as @xmath72 or @xmath73 , among others .",
    "these quantities have a number of significant physical interpretations .",
    "assuming an initial number state in the quasiparticle basis , some important correlation functions are given by : @xmath74    a surface plot of @xmath72 as a function of temperature , @xmath75 and time , @xmath76 is given in figure [ fig : betasb ] a ) ; a non - zero value of this quantity implies the presence of squeezing and hence entanglement .",
    "the correlation function of equation ( [ eq : n1 ] ) is just the population in the lower mode , and is directly measurable as the amplitude of oscillation .",
    "a surface plot of this quantity is shown in figure [ fig : betasb ] b ) as a function of temperature @xmath77 and time @xmath78 .",
    "we note that at @xmath70 the trend of both correlation functions is given by the be distribution function for the population in the lower mode . as time evolves , the population of the lower mode increases .",
    "the solution is valid within the non - depleted regime , where mode 2 is continually replenished .",
    "we now examine the case where mode 2 is depleted and an explicit analytical solution is possible .",
    "the analysis is handled more easily by considering the equations of motion for the number operators @xmath79 , which from equations ( [ eq : twomodes1 ] - [ eq : twomodes2 ] ) are @xmath80    equations ( [ eq : n_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : n_2 ] ) can , in fact , be uncoupled by calculating the second derivative and using the fact that the operator @xmath81 is a constant of motion .",
    "the uncoupled equations are given by @xmath82 in the case in which @xmath83 is strong , we can determine the population by taking the average of equation ( [ eq : uncoupn2 ] ) .",
    "we end up with a c - number second - order differential equation with the following initial conditions @xmath84 whose solution is given by    @xmath85    here @xmath86 and @xmath87 are jacobi elliptic functions @xcite , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the roots of the quadratic polynomial @xmath90 . as we have pointed out , the coupling coefficient @xmath44 depends on temperature ; consequently the behaviour of @xmath83 must change with @xmath75 .",
    "the initial value @xmath91 was calculated for each temperature according to the be distribution function and an initial driving was also considered .",
    "these parameters were then used in the solution ( [ eq : sol1n2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : population ] is a plot of the population @xmath83 showing its dependence on temperature and time .    in a practical case",
    ", the fitting of an experiment to the theory can be realized by noticing that the initial part of the curve for the population in the quasiparticle mode 2 could be approximated by a function of the form @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : graphn2 ] ) . to a first approximation",
    "the quantity @xmath93 is given by @xmath94    the full solution , given by equation ( [ eq : sol1n2 ] ) , has been used in a fitting routine and a plot of @xmath93 as a function of temperature is shown in figure [ fig : gamma ] . in principle",
    ", @xmath93 has the advantage of being readily measurable . at lower temperatures the effect of the initial population is dominant , while , for higher temperatures , the coupling coefficient @xmath44 decreases rapidly so that the effect of the initial population is masked , which happens at approximately @xmath95 .",
    "this effect is the result of having a competition between the changing coupling strength and the influence of the initial population .",
    "it is noted that one could also consider @xmath93 as an experimentally accessible indicator of the amount of squeezing in the quasiparticles , as it is proportional to the coupling strength @xmath44 .",
    "squeezed states of the electromagnetic field were realized some time ago and the degree of squeezing can be measured with standard techniques such as homodyne detection . in the case of squeezed quasiparticle modes of a bec",
    ", it will be necessary to devise a method for their detection .",
    "it is noted that a related work that uses neutron scattering was suggested by yurke @xcite .",
    "we suggest for our system that raman scattering between the two excited phonon states could be used to characterise the amount of squeezing present since single particle transitions will be strongly modified by the presence of a correlated pair excitation .",
    "this effect has been demonstrated for a homogeneous gas by stamper - kurn et.al .",
    "@xcite who used a single particle transition to excite a phonon .",
    "we then have two routes for the transfer of momentum .",
    "the first moves a particle with zero momentum to momentum @xmath34 , while the second takes the momentum from @xmath96 to zero .",
    "the interference between the two routes will influence the single particle transition .",
    "raman scattering will be strongly influenced by the presence of coherent states in the lowest mode .",
    "the precise form will depend on the conditions , pulses used , and other experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "similar ideas have been used to probe coherent phonons in solid state physics @xcite .    in summary",
