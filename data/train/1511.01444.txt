    "this is a commentary on teichmller s paper _ ein verschiebungssatz der quasikonformen abbildung _ , published in 1944 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to the english translation which appears in this volume .",
    "the present paper is part of a series of commentaries written by various authors on papers of teichmller .",
    "these papers contain some ideas which are still unknown to teichmller theorists , see for example , and @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite is one of the last that teichmller wrote , and especially the last one about quasiconformal maps . in this paper , he solved the following geometric problem :    [ mainpb ] find and describe the quasiconformal map from the unit disc to itself such that    * its restriction to the unit circle is the identity map , * the image of @xmath0 is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , * its quasiconformal dilatation is as small as possible .",
    "as teichmller wrote at the beginning of his paper , this extremal problem is rather different from those studied in @xcite .",
    "it is due to the fact that mappings fix all boundary points and not only a finite number of such points .",
    "the paper @xcite is at the foundation of the theory that we call now the _ classical teichmller theory_.    in order to solve problem [ mainpb ] , teichmller used an idea already contained in  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 of @xcite .. '' ] indeed , he obtained an equivalent problem ( see problem [ pbb ] in subsection [ subsection ] ) by taking ramified coverings , which turns out to be simpler .",
    "let us say a few words about that .",
    "first , he constructed , using explicit conformal maps , two @xmath5-sheeted branched coverings of the unit disc , the first one branched at @xmath0 and the other at @xmath1 .",
    "these two covering spaces can be conformally represented by ellipses with data depending on @xmath6 .",
    "this construction shows that the main problem is equivalent to a problem of minimization of the quasiconformal dilatation for mappings between two ellipses with a particular condition on the boundary .",
    "after that , he showed , using the cauchy - schwarz inequality ( as in the solution to the grtzsch problem ) , that the extremal map between the ellipses is given by an affine transformation .",
    "finally , he gave for the quasiconformal dilatation of the extremal map a lower bound depending on @xmath6 and an asymptotic behaviour when @xmath6 approaches @xmath0 .",
    "in @xcite , teichmller did not give definitions ; all the definitions he used are in @xcite .",
    "this is why in these notes we will change the organization of the text in comparison with @xcite ; but we will keep all the ideas from teichmller .    after recalling some notation and definitions , especially about quasiconformal mappings , we will explain the grtzsch problem and we will recall the notion of grtzsch module",
    ". we will then give details on the proof of teichmller .",
    "we will conclude by some applications of this result .",
    "* acknowledgements .",
    "* the author would like to express his sincere gratitude to professor athanase papadopoulos for giving an opportunity for writing this commentary and especially for his patience and kindness .",
    "the author wants to thanks professor kenichi ohshika for his helpful comments on a previous version .",
    "the author also thanks professor irwin kra for his interest and for a correspondence on these results .",

    "all along this paper , we shall be interested in planar quasiconformal mappings . unless otherwise noted , all domains that we consider are connected subsets of the riemann sphere @xmath7 .",
    "there are several books which deal with quasiconformal mappings , see e.g. @xcite , or .",
    "we give below two equivalent definitions of quasiconformal maps .",
    "both of them are interesting and they introduce notions ( module and quasiconformal dilatation ) that teichmller used to solve problem [ mainpb ] .    a _ quadrilateral _ @xmath8 is a jordan domain ( i.e. a simply connected domain whose boundary is a jordan curve ) with four distinct boundary points .",
    "sometimes , we will denote by @xmath9 such a quadrilateral , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are boundary points and we shall usually assume that these four points appear on the boundary in that order . by applying successively the riemann mapping theorem , the carathodory theorem and a suitable schwarz - christoffel mapping , we know that @xmath8 is conformally equivalent ( i.e. there exists a holomorphic bijection ) to a rectangle @xmath14 of vertical side length @xmath15 and horizontal length side @xmath16 , for some uniquely defined @xmath17 . is sent ( conformally ) onto the upper half - plane @xmath18 and this map can be extended to a homeomorphism from @xmath8 to @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the four distinguished points of @xmath8 are sent respectively to @xmath0 , @xmath15 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for some @xmath22 .",
    "finally , @xmath23 ( for a suitable @xmath12 ) maps the upper half - plane onto the rectangle @xmath14 of vertical length side @xmath15 and horizontal length side @xmath16 .",
    "] we call the _ module _ of @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath24 , the number @xmath16 .    a _ doubly - connected domain _",
    "@xmath25 is a connected domain whose boundary is the union of two disjoint jordan curves . as for the quadrilateral , we can associate a module to a doubly - connected domain .",
    "we know that such a domain is conformally equivalent to an annulus whose inner radius is @xmath15 and outer radius is @xmath26 , for some @xmath27 .",
    "we call the _ module _ of @xmath25 , denoted by @xmath28 , the number @xmath29 .",
    "another way to introduce the module is to define it as the inverse of _ extremal length _ of a particular family of curves .",
    "this relation enables us to extend the notion of quasiconformal mapping in higher dimensions .",
    "let @xmath30 be an open set in @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 be an orientation - preserving homeomorphism .",
    "we say that @xmath33 is _ quasiconformal _ if there exists @xmath34 such that for any quadrilateral @xmath35 ,    @xmath36    in this case , we set @xmath37 and we call it the _ _ quasiconformal dilatation _ _ of @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , we say that @xmath33 is @xmath38-quasiconformal .",
    "to simplify notation , we write _ q.c . _ instead of quasiconformal .    with this definition , it is easy to see that for @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively @xmath41-q.c . and @xmath42-q.c . on suitable domains , @xmath43 is @xmath44-q.c .",
    "we can show that @xmath33 is conformal if and only if @xmath45 .",
    "thus , if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are conformal , then @xmath48 has the same q.c .",
    "dilatation as @xmath33 .    before giving an equivalent definition of q.c .",
    "mappings , we recall that a map @xmath33 is _ absolutely continuous on lines _ ( _ acl _ ) in a domain @xmath30 if for every rectangle @xmath49 in @xmath30 , @xmath33 is absolutely continuous as a function of @xmath6 ( resp .",

    "@xmath52 ) .",
    "we can show that such a function @xmath33 is differientiable almost everywhere ( a.e . ) in @xmath30 .",

    "moreover , definition [ def1 ] is due to ahlfors ( see @xcite )",
    ". works by bers , mori and yjb show that definition [ def1 ] and definition [ def2 ] are equivalent .",
    "a proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "grtzsch introduced q.c .",
    "mappings in @xcite under the name `` nichtkonforme abbildungen . ''",
    "his definition is similar to definition [ def2 ] but with a stronger hypothesis : he assumes the maps differentiable .",
    "teichmller was the first to use q.c .",
    "mappings in a substantial manner .",
    "he developed this theory to study the _ _ teichmller space _ _ and the so - called _ teichmller metric_. note that he used in @xcite , and @xcite the grtzsch definition for q.c .",
    "mappings in a slightly different form .",
    "he considered mappings which are differentiable `` up to finitely many closed analytical curve segments . ''",
    "since nothing changes in teichmller s proof ( proposition [ prop ] below ) we shall use definition [ def2 ] for q.c .",
    "in particular , using the point of view of definition [ def2 ] , we can show that for any q.c .",
    "mapping @xmath33 , @xmath58 ( a.e . ) .",
    "to conclude the solution of problem [ mainpb ] , teichmller used the same idea as grtzsch used in @xcite to solve what we call now the grtzsch problem .",
    "in fact , teichmller used a kind of generalization of grtzsch s problem in his development of classical teichmller theory .",
    "so , let us present this problem .",
