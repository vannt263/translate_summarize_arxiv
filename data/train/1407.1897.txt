    "most of the binary black hole systems in our galaxy are x - ray transients that undergo outbursts where the luminosity can change by factors of @xmath13 or @xmath14 . as the observational properties of these systems change during outbursts that last for a few months to a few years",
    ", they can undergo state transitions .",
    "there are different schemes for classifying states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but one useful classification depends largely on whether the thermal , soft power - law , or hard power - law component dominates the @xmath0120kev energy spectrum .",
    "these are called the thermal - dominant , steep power - law , and hard states , respectively @xcite , and intermediate states also occur .",
    "physically , the thermal - dominant state occurs when the optically thick accretion disk extends near or all the way to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , and this component is well - modeled with a multi - temperature disk component @xcite .",
    "while radio jets are quenched during the thermal - dominant state @xcite , the hard state has steady jets that emit in the radio , ir , and perhaps at higher frequencies @xcite .    most often",
    ", black hole transients have outbursts where the source rises in the hard state , makes a transition to the thermal - dominant or steep power - law state at a relatively high luminosity , and then transits back to the hard state at lower luminosity @xcite .",
    "this hysteresis effect and its cause have been a topic of extensive discussion , and many theories have been advanced to explain it .",
    "one idea is that sources tend to stay in the hard state during the rise because the hard x - ray emission keeps the corona hot while sources tend to stay in the soft state ( i.e. , either the thermal - dominant or steep power - law state ) during decay because the soft x - ray emission keeps the corona cool @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the two - flow picture where there is a keplerian flow that corresponds to the optically thick accretion disk and a sub - keplerian flow with the energetic electrons that produce the hard x - rays @xcite . in this model",
    ", the bright hard state can be explained by a longer ( viscous ) time scale for changes in the keplerian flow compared to the sub - keplerian flow @xcite .",
    "in other potential explanations for the hysteresis , the large - scale magnetic field in the disk , which can depend on the accretion state or the type of accretion flow , plays an important role @xcite .",
    "the @xcite model explains the hysteresis by invoking the connection between the magnetic field and the viscosity . with the magnetorotational instability being the source of viscosity @xcite ,",
    "changes in magnetic field imply changes in disk viscosity , and hysteresis is produced because the transition luminosity is given by @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the viscosity parameter and @xmath4 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "@xcite also emphasize the role of the magnetic field in producing the hysteresis , but this is primarily through the possible connection between the magnetic field in the inner disk and the production of jets . @xcite and @xcite",
    "discuss how changes in the magnetic field may explain the the observed jet behaviors such as the steady jet in the hard state and the impulsive relativistic jets that are typically produced when systems make a transition from a bright hard state @xcite .    in this context",
    ", 4u  163047 is an interesting source since the large number of outbursts allows us to compare their properties .",
    "at least one well - studied outburst follows the typical hysteresis pattern . in 1998",
    ", the source was seen in the hard state during the rise @xcite , radio jets were produced @xcite , and it made a transition back to the hard state at a much lower luminosity than the transition during the rise @xcite . however , other outbursts have shown very different behavior . a detailed comparison between the 1998 outburst and the 20022004 outburst showed that the 20022004 outburst was much softer @xcite , and it did not exhibit bright hard states @xcite or radio emission @xcite .",
    "the 2010 outburst was very similar to 20022004 in terms of hardness and evolution ( see appendix ) ; however , while there was no observational coverage of the end of the 20022004 outburst , we have obtained such coverage in 2010 .",
    "given the fact that 4u  163047 is in a crowded region of the galactic plane , source confusion was a major issue for the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in following the source to low luminosities during previous outbursts @xcite .",
    "thus , in this work , we have used x - ray imaging observations with _ swift _ , _ suzaku _ , and _",
    "chandra _ to study the end of the 2010 outburst and quiescence ( although the _ rxte _ measurements are shown in the appendix ) .",
    "a main motivation for this study is to determine the time of the transition to the hard state and to obtain a long observation with _ suzaku _ after the transition in order to measure the iron k@xmath10 emission line that comes from the reflection component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this follows a similar campaign where we observed gx  3394 and obtained iron line measurements that provided evidence for truncation of the accretion disk @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we describe the observations and how the data were analyzed ( section 2 ) , report the results of the analysis , focusing on the evolution of the energy spectrum ( section 3 ) , and then provide a discussion of the evolution of the spectral states and the implications for the constraints on the iron line and the quiescent luminosity limit ( section 4 ) .",
    "we report on _ swift _ and _ suzaku _ observations of 4u  163047 taken between 2010 july 15 and 2010 aug 17 near the end of an outburst and _ chandra _ observations made in 2011 june when the source was in quiescence .",

    "figure  [ fig : lc_with_bat]a shows the _ rxte _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) light curve for the 2010 outburst .",
    "the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and _ suzaku _ observations occurred well after the bright part of the outburst , but the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) light curve ( figure  [ fig : lc_with_bat]b ) shows that a reflare occurred during this time .",
    "the reflare was also reported based on observations with the _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",

    "due to systematic uncertainties in the xis response matrix associated with absorption edges in the instrument materials , we did not include the 1.651.9kev or 2.22.4kev energy bands , but we used the rest of the 0.49kev and 0.412kev bandpass for xis1 and xis0/3 , respectively .",

    ", we rebinned so that each bin ( except for the highest energy bin ) has a detection at the 3-@xmath22 level or higher . when fitting , we minimized the w - statistic , which is a generalization of the cash statistic @xcite for the case of non - zero background , and we used @xmath23 as the test statistic .",
    "we fitted each spectrum individually with an absorbed power - law model .",
    "4u  163047 is known to have a high column density , and both interstellar material as well as material local to the source may contribute . as any local contribution could be variable , we left the column density as a free parameter in our fits .",
    "we used @xcite abundances and @xcite cross - sections for the absorption calculation .",
    "the power - law model provides a good description of the _ swift _ spectra as indicated by the reduced-@xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) values reported in table  [ tab : parameters ] . for observation # 1 ,",
    "the spectrum is very soft with a power - law photon index of @xmath25 ( 90% confidence errors ) .",
    "the spectrum hardened dramatically after observation # 1 , and during observations # 2 , # 3 , and # 4 , the range of best fit values is @xmath261.7 , and the 90% confidence upper limits on @xmath27 are @xmath112.0 , @xmath112.2 , and @xmath112.1 , for the three observations , respectively . the spectral transition is illustrated in figure  [ fig : swift_spectra ] .",
    "@xmath28 ) from figure  [ fig : lc_with_bat]b have been multiplied by a factor of 30 for easier comparison to the xrt measurements.[fig : lc_xrt_bat ] ]    the softness of the spectrum for observation # 1 suggests that it is more likely dominated by thermal emission rather than a power - law .",
    "we fit the spectrum with an absorbed multi - temperature blackbody model @xcite , commonly called the disk - blackbody model , and this also provides an acceptable fit with @xmath29 for 12 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the disk - blackbody fit returns a value of @xmath30kev for the temperature at the inner edge of the accretion disk , which is typical for accreting black holes in the soft state .",
    "the normalization we measure , @xmath31 , is related to the inner disk radius according to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the inner radius in units of km , @xmath34 is the distance to the source in units of 10kpc , and @xmath35 is the disk inclination .",
    "thus , @xmath36 corresponds to @xmath37 km ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "given that the distance to 4u  163047 is estimated to be near 10kpc and that the binary inclination is not extremely high ( since the source is not eclipsing ) , such a small inner radius would only be consistent with a very low mass black hole : @xmath012  for the maximally rotating case and an even smaller mass for slower rotation rates .    ]",
    "a much more likely scenario is that the observation # 1 spectrum actually has two components : the disk - blackbody and a power - law .",
    "we re - fitted spectrum # 1 with such a two component model , and this allows for a significantly larger normalization @xmath39 for a disk - blackbody component with @xmath40kev ( both are 90% confidence upper limits ) . with the possibility of the higher @xmath41 , the implied inner radius is @xmath42 km ( @xmath38 ) , which is physically reasonable . while the @xmath43 estimates or limits are useful for determining which spectral model is the most likely , it should be noted that , in addition to the distance and inclination uncertainties , there are other corrections that would be necessary @xcite if our intent was to report a measurement of @xmath43 .",
    "the _ suzaku_/xis spectrum ( observation # 5 ) is well - described by an absorbed power - law model ( see figure  [ fig : spectrum_suzaku ] for the spectrum and residuals and table  [ tab : parameters ] for the parameter values ) with @xmath44@xmath28 and @xmath45 .",
    "such a value for the power - law photon index is expected for a black hole in the hard state .",
    "we might also expect to see evidence for a reflection component in the spectrum .",
    "while the limited bandpass of xis would not allow us to detect the compton bump , which peaks near 2040kev @xcite , the characteristic iron emission line and absorption edge is covered by xis .",
    "although the residuals ( see figure  [ fig : spectrum_suzaku]b ) do not show strong evidence for iron features , adding a gaussian with a centroid of @xmath46kev and a width of @xmath47kev improves the fit from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "we used the xspec script simftest to produce 1000 simulated xis spectra with an absorbed power - law as the input spectrum and to fit them with and without a gaussian .",
    "while fitting the simulated spectra , @xmath50 was restricted to 67kev and @xmath51 was kept within the 90% confidence error range found when fitting the actual data .",
    "we found improvements in the fit as large as the observed improvement for 15 of the simulated spectra , indicating that the significance of the line is 2.2-@xmath22 , which we do not consider to be a significant detection . with the gaussian parameters free ,",
    "the 90% confidence upper limit on the equivalent width ( @xmath52 ) of the line is @xmath11100ev . for a narrow line at 6.4kev ,",
    "the value is @xmath53ev .    to understand the implications of these upper limits for reflection models , we fit the xis spectra with a model consisting of an absorbed power - law model and the reflionx reflection model @xcite .",
    "when leaving the parameters for this model free , the best fit value for the ionization parameter is its minimum value ( @xmath54ergcms@xmath2 ) in order to fit the low - level emission feature near 6.4kev . the iron abundance is not constrained , and we fix it to the solar value ( 1.0 in the reflionx model ) . fitting the spectrum with this model gives a 90% confidence upper limit on the reflection covering fraction of @xmath55 . while this upper limit is valid for the case where there is no relativistic smearing of the reflection component ( e.g. , if the disk is truncated ) ,",
    "if we allow the reflection component to be smeared using , e.g. , kdblur @xcite , a significantly higher covering fraction is possible .",
    "the evolution of the source during observations # 15 is consistent with a transition from a low - luminosity soft or intermediate state during observation # 1 to a hard state in observation # 2 .",
    "we investigated the source evolution during the decay by making a light curve of the absorbed 110kev fluxes during observations # 25 .",
    "we calculated one flux point for each of the _ swift _ observations and made a light curve with 5500s ( approximately the satellite orbital period ) time resolution for _",
    "suzaku_. we converted the xis count rates to fluxes using the power - law fit to the energy spectrum .",
    "the model shown in figure  [ fig : lc_decay ] shows that an exponential with an e - folding decay time of @xmath9d provides a good description of the _ suzaku _ and _ swift _ points ( @xmath56 for 42 dof ) .    ]",
    "although there is a long gap of nearly 10 months between the _ suzaku _ and _ chandra _ observations , the _ chandra _ observation provides an opportunity to determine if the source continued its decay into quiescence . for the observation on 2011",
    "june 16 ( obsid 12530 ) , 4u  163047 was @xmath20 from the _ chandra _ aimpoint , where the 90% encircled energy fraction ( eef ) radius ( for 4.5kev photons ) is @xmath57 as determined from the _ chandra _ psf viewer . from previous radio detections ,",
    "the 4u  163047 position is known to subarcsecond accuracy @xcite , and we find only one photon ( with an energy of 1.48kev ) within @xmath57 of that position during the 19,260s _ chandra _ observation .",
    "the prediction for the number of 0.58kev background counts in the same region is 0.57 counts .",
    "thus , using poisson statistics , the upper limit on the count rate is @xmath11@xmath58s@xmath2 . assuming that the spectrum has a power - law shape with @xmath59@xmath28 and @xmath60 @xcite , the upper limits on the absorbed and unabsorbed 0.58kev fluxes are @xmath11@xmath61erg@xmath28s@xmath2 and @xmath11@xmath62erg@xmath28s@xmath2 .",
    "d.[fig : lc_decay ] ]",
    "due to its location in a crowded region of the galactic plane , imaging x - ray observations are required to reliably follow the evolution and determine the properties of 4u  163047 at low luminosities .",
    "we have used _ swift _ and _ suzaku _ observations during the decay phase of the 2010 outburst and a _ chandra _ observation in quiescence to provide new information about 4u  163047 at low luminosities . in the following ,",
    "we discuss these findings in the order they were observed : the soft state , the transition to the hard state and subsequent evolution , the limits on a reflection component , and the limits on the quiescent luminosity .      during _ swift _ observation # 1 ,",
    "the spectrum of 4u  163047 was very soft , and it was likely dominated by thermal emission . despite the low flux , the source had clearly not made a transition to the hard state , which is notable because black hole transients typically make a transition to the hard state during outburst decay at luminosities between 0.3% and 3% of the eddington limit @xcite . for 4u  163047 ,",
    "the unabsorbed 210kev flux was @xmath63erg@xmath28s@xmath2 during this observation .",
    "the conversion to an eddington - scaled luminosity depends on the distance to the system , the mass of the black hole , and a bolometric correction .",
    "we follow previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by assuming a distance of 10kpc , giving a 210kev luminosity of @xmath64ergs@xmath2 .",
    "although the distance is somewhat uncertain , @xcite argue that it is less than 11kpc since there is a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) at this distance @xcite in the direction of 4u  163047 . the measured column density for 4u  163047 can be as low as @xmath65@xmath28 , but @xmath66 would always be significantly larger if the source was behind the gmc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". the black hole mass has not been measured , and we use a fiducial value of 10  for this calculation , giving an eddington luminosity of @xmath67@xmath7ergs@xmath2 , where @xmath7 is the mass of the black hole in units of 10 .",
    "thus , in the 210kev band , the eddington - scaled luminosity is 0.008@xmath6% .    with the limited bandpass of xrt , making the bolometric correction",
    "is not straightforward . while it might be reasonable to extrapolate the steep ( @xmath68 ) power - law to @xmath6910kev ,",
    "extrapolating to lower energies is not consistent with the fact that the origin of the soft x - ray emission is likely thermal . in section 3",
    ", we fit the observation # 1 spectrum with a disk - blackbody plus power - law model , and here , we use those best fit parameters for the extrapolation . with that model",
    ", we found @xmath70@xmath28 , @xmath71kev , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and an unabsorbed 210kev flux for the power - law component of @xmath74erg@xmath28s@xmath2 . in the 0.5200kev band ,",
    "the unabsorbed flux is @xmath75erg@xmath28s@xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath8@xmath6% .",
    "thus , this detection of a soft state occurred at a luminosity that is at least an order of magnitude lower than the level where a transition to the hard state would be expected .    as a consistency check on the 4u  163047 distance and black hole mass , we consider the highest fluxes seen from this source , which were 0.84 crab ( 1.512kev ) during the 20022004 outburst @xcite and 1.4 crab ( 36kev ) in 1977 @xcite . from the 20022004 outburst , the highest broadband ( 3200kev ) flux quoted was @xmath76erg@xmath28s@xmath2 , and considering the bolometric correction and the brighter 1977 outburst , the maximum flux from 4u  163047 is at least @xmath77erg@xmath28s@xmath2 . for a distance of 10kpc , this flux corresponds to @xmath78@xmath6% , and @xmath79 would occur at a distance of 14kpc .",
    "although this limit is less constraining than the @xmath1111kpc discussed above , this provides a second line of evidence that the distance could not be very much more than the 10kpc that we have assumed ( unless the 4u  163047 black hole is more massive than other systems ) .",
    "while we note that the distance could be less than 10kpc if a significant fraction of the column density is local to the source , a lower distance would make the luminosity when we observe the soft state even lower and more unusual .",
    "there are other cases of soft states at low luminosities , but the best known examples are not at a level as low as we are seeing for 4u  163047 . in the detailed study of several black hole systems by @xcite ,",
    "the lowest luminosity soft state was seen at 0.3% @xmath4 for xte  j1720330 .",
    "1e  1740.72942 and grs  1758258 both showed unusual behavior by making a transition to a true thermal - dominant state ( i.e. , the spectra required a thermal disk component ) after a drop in luminosity .",
    "however , in both of these cases , the thermal - dominant state was seen at 12% @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "even so , this might provide an interesting comparison to 4u  163047 since this low - soft state has been called a `` dynamical '' soft state @xcite based on the two - flow picture and the idea that there is some level of independence between the optically thick flow and the sub - keplerian flow @xcite .",
    "if the luminosity threshold for the transition to the hard state is set by the magnetic field and viscosity in the disk @xcite , then the interpretation for a low - soft state would be a weaker than usual large - scale magnetic field in the disk . in the @xcite picture ,",
    "the hard state jet - emitting disk is established when the disk magnetization , @xmath80 , which is related to the disk magnetic field as well as the total pressure ( gas plus radiation ) in the disk , reaches a specific threshold level ( called @xmath81 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , a delayed transition to the hard state would be predicted if @xmath80 starts at a lower value or if it rises slowly . as the rise of @xmath80 is primarily due to a drop in mass accretion rate , which we assume occurs during the decay of all outbursts , it is more likely that @xmath80 starts at a lower value .    as discussed in @xcite and shown in @xcite",
    ", a low magnetic field leads to a lower viscosity parameter , and a lower transition luminosity would be predicted , which is consistent with what we see in 4u  163047 .",
    "if the magnetic field was lower than typical during the entire outburst , then this might also explain why we never observed a bright hard state ( see appendix ) and also why radio emission was not reported during the 2010 outburst or during the other outburst ( 20022004 ) which had very similar evolution in the hardness intensity diagram .",
    "when the transition to the hard state did finally occur , there was a very dramatic increase in the 210kev flux with an increase by at least a factor of 12 ( see figure  [ fig : lc_xrt_bat ] and table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "while increases in flux have been seen at the soft - to - hard state transition , they are more modest . for xte  j1650500 , the flux increased by a factor of 34 in the 320kev band @xcite , and xte  j1752223 showed an increase by a factor of 3.5 in the 325kev band @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : increase ] shows the increase as a ratio of the peak x - ray flux after the transition to the flux prior to the transition ( @xmath82 ) as a function of the eddington fraction prior to the transition ( @xmath83 ) for 4u  163047 compared to the other black hole transient outbursts studied by @xcite .",
    "the values shown in figure  [ fig : increase ] are for the 3200kev band , which is the bandpass used in the @xcite analysis .",
    "we suspect that there is a connection between the low luminosity soft state and this unusually large increase in the hard state .",
    "one piece of support for this is that , in the hard state , the flux reached a high enough level to be at a typical level for a soft - to - hard state transition .",
    "based on the observation # 2 spectrum , and extrapolating the power - law to higher energies ( i.e. , making the bolometric correction ) , we find that the 0.5200kev unabsorbed flux is @xmath84erg@xmath28s@xmath2 , which corresponds to 0.7@xmath6% .",
    "in other words , if this hard state flare had happened @xmath050d earlier , we would not have seen the low luminosity soft state , nor the large increase in flux at the state transition , and the evolution would have appeared to be typical .",
    "although this effect has not been seen to such a large level in other sources , figure  [ fig : increase ] suggests that the outbursts with the lowest luminosity transitions may tend to have larger flux increases .",
    "we also obtained a very good measurement of the decay in the hard state ( see figure  [ fig : lc_decay ] ) , and it is simply an exponential with an e - folding time of @xmath9d .",
    "this number is much shorter than previous e - folding decay times measured for 4u  163047 . during the 1996 , 1998 , and 1999 outbursts , the decay time scales for the 1.512kev light curve were between 12 and 15d @xcite .",
    "however , an important difference is that the measurements made in the 1990s were for the part of the outburst when the source was still in the soft state . within the two - flow picture ,",
    "this suggests the possibility that the different e - folding times are related to different viscous time scales for the two flows .",
    "the short time scale could also be related to the fact that the transition occurred at a very low mass accretion rate so that the amount of material in the hard x - ray emitting region was more quickly depleted .      a main goal of the _ suzaku _ observation was to place constraints on the reflection component , which depends on the geometry of the accretion disk and the hard x - ray source .",
    "with xis , the main constraint comes from a measurement of the strength of the iron line . during the brighter phases of outbursts , the fe k@xmath10 region of the 4u  163047 spectrum is complex , showing many different types of absorption and emission lines .",
    "the absorption lines that have been detected are narrow @xcite and are caused by material in a disk wind @xcite or the accretion disk atmosphere @xcite or both .",

    "the blue diamonds are for the seven sources and 12 outbursts reported in @xcite , where a 3200kev band was used .",
    "the black error bar is for 4u  163047 during the 2010 transition using a bandpass of 3200kev for a distance of 10kpc .",
    "the error region corresponds to a black hole mass in a 315  range.[fig : increase ] ]    an emission line from a reflection component was seen in gx  3394 in the hard state at a low luminosity of 0.14% @xmath4 , and the narrow width and decreasing strength of the line @xcite clearly shows a change in the system geometry compared to the broad line seen when the source was bright @xcite . @xcite interpreted this as truncation of the inner accretion disk , but @xcite point out that this could also be due to a change in the geometry of the hard x - ray source with one possible scenario being that this emission comes from the jet . for 4u  163047",
    ", our main result is an upper limit on the equivalent width of a narrow line at 6.4kev of @xmath53ev .",
    "this limit is lower than the measured @xmath52 of the line in gx  3394 , which was @xmath86ev .",
    "the low @xmath52 is consistent with 4u  163047 showing a continuation of the evolution seen for gx  3394 with the disk becoming even more truncated or with the hard x - ray source moving even farther away from the disk ( perhaps along the jet ) as the luminosity drops .",
    "the 1 - 100kev eddington - scaled luminosity of 4u  163047 during the _ suzaku _ observation was 0.03@xmath6% , which is about five times lower than for gx  3394 . while we can not rule out the possibility of a broad line , even that limit ( @xmath87ev ) is lower than the limit of 180ev suggested by @xcite as being a `` significant non - detection '' in the sense that a line from a disk that extends to the innermost stable circular orbit is predicted to have a line with an @xmath52 near 180ev .",
    "there has been significant interest in the quiescent luminosities of stellar mass black holes and the comparison to neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the typically lower black hole luminosities have been taken as evidence for the existence of a black hole event horizons as accretion energy can be advected across an event horizon but not through a neutron star surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; although , there may be other possibilities for where the accretion energy goes , such as into the jet @xcite .",
    "thus , it is somewhat surprising that a source as well - studied as 4u  163047 does not have a sensitive measurement of the quiescent flux . assuming a distance of 10kpc , the lowest previously reported luminosity came from a _ rosat _ measurement in the 0.22.4kev band that was made in 1992 @xcite , and the value was @xmath11@xmath88ergs@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "given the high column density of 4u  163047 and the very soft _ rosat _ bandpass , this limit is highly dependent on the spectral shape assumed .",
    "our 0.58kev unabsorbed flux limit from _ chandra _ corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath11@xmath12ergs@xmath2 . with the lower value and the wider bandpass ,",
    "this limit is significantly more constraining than the previous limit .",
    "a value of @xmath12ergs@xmath2 would be the third brightest quiescent black hole out of 15 black hole systems with reported measurements @xcite .",
    "the luminosity level that divides neutron stars and black holes depends on the orbital period of the binary since the quiescent mass accretion rate is expected to be correlated with orbital period .",
    "the limit we measure for 4u  163047 would fall in the black hole region for orbital periods higher than @xmath020hr .",
    "although the orbital period is not known for 4u  163047 , a period near 20hr would not be surprising . in the future ,",
    "if the orbital period is found to be lower , this would motivate deeper quiescent x - ray observations to try to obtain a measurement of the quiescent luminosity .",
    "x - ray observations of 4u  163047 at the end of its 2010 outburst show that the source decayed to a much lower luminosity than is typical before making a transition to the hard state .",
    "about two weeks before the transition to the hard state , the source had a soft and likely thermal x - ray spectrum and the 0.5200kev luminosity was @xmath0@xmath89ergs@xmath2 ( assuming a distance of 10kpc ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath8@xmath6% , which is at least an order of magnitude lower than typical transition luminosities .",
    "we discuss this evolution in terms of theoretical models for hysteresis of black hole state transitions , and based on work by @xcite and @xcite , we suggest that the behavior could be explained by a lower than typical large - scale magnetic field in the accretion disk .",
    "we also consider the two - flow model of @xcite as the evolution may suggest decoupling between the optically thick keplerian disk and the sub - keplerian flow .",
    "any conclusion about hysteresis also needs to consider the geometry of the system , including the location of the inner radius of the optically thick disk and whether there is significant x - ray emission from the jet in the hard state . with _ suzaku _",
    ", we have placed tight limits on the presence of a reflection component from 4u  163047 in the hard state at @xmath8@xmath6% , and the lack of a reflection component is consistent with a large inner radius .",
    "more detailed theoretical work is required to determine whether a non - detection of reflection is consistent with a small inner radius and an increased height for the hard x - ray source above the disk .",
    "finally , we report a significantly lower upper limit on the quiescent x - ray luminosity , which is interesting to compare to the other measurements of quiescent luminosities of neutron star and black hole transients .",
