    "the domino effect has received considerable attention because it is spectacular and seems to be governed by simple physics @xcite . however ,",
    "careful experiments @xcite are not so easy .",
    "measuring the propagation speed of the order of a meter per second of a train of falling dominoes , is already too difficult to observe by elementary means .",
    "equally , the theory of toppling dominoes is not as simple as the phenomenon looks like and can not be reduced to the straightforward application of the conservation laws of energy and angular momentum .",
    "the discussion of a row of falling dominoes involves two aspects : the tumbling motion and the collisions .",
    "the first to realize that the domino effect is a collective phenomenon was d.  e.  shaw @xcite .",
    "he noted that the dominoes lean on each other after collision .",
    "consequently the collision of dominoes is fully inelastic and this is the main source of energy losses during the process .",
    "it is tempting to invoke conservation of angular momentum at the collision as in @xcite , but this does not apply , since colliding dominoes topple around different axes @xcite .",
    "the reason to come back on the domino effect is a question posed at the dutch science quiz 2012 reading : `` _ how many dominoes does one need to topple a domino as tall as the domtoren ? _ '' ( a tower of 112 meter high ) .",
    "a restriction was that the dominoes have the same aspect ratios as that of standard dominoes .",
    "this restriction is essential for an unique answer , since the thinner the domino ( with fixed height ) the easier it topples .",
    "the idea behind the question is that every successive domino is a factor @xmath0 larger than the preceding one .",
    "the dominoes grow in size as a geometric series @xmath1 and the correct answer is the @xmath2 that makes @xmath1 times the height of a standard domino equal to 112 meter .",
    "whitehead @xcite describes a demonstration with a magnification factor @xmath3 .    in order to turn this problem into a scientific problem",
    ", one has to make further specifications .",
    "one is a rule for the distance between successive dominoes .",
    "although not specified in the problem , the logical choice is to scale the distance with the size . to let the distance grow with the size of the domino is reasonable , the larger the domino , the more space one needs between them .",
    "moreover , there will be an optimal distance in each cycle and this optimum will scale with the size of the dominoes .",
    "so we restrict ourselves to a scale invariant model .    in order to make the mechanical model precise",
    ", a few more conditions have to be imposed :    1 .   the dominoes may not slide with respect to the ground .",
    "it is clear that sliding is an energy loss that impedes the domino effect .",
    "infinite friction with the floor is favorable and can basically be reached in practice .",
    "thus the only possible motion is to topple over .",
    "so the state of domino is given by a single angle @xmath4 measuring the deviation from the normal to the ground .",
    "2 .   the dominoes stay in contact with each other after the collision @xcite .",
    "this makes the collisions fully inelastic . in practice",
    "this condition is fulfilled as the movie of the the demonstration with wooden dominoes shows @xcite .",
    "inelastic collisions are the main energy drain .",
    "steel dominoes would do better , but are too costly to produce in large sizes .",
    "we take this condition as a constraint on the maximum possible @xmath0 .",
    "3 .   after hitting a new domino , the dominoes slide frictionless over each other .",
    "it is of course not realized with wooden dominoes , but it would be not difficult to smooth the surfaces and minimize the friction by lubrication .",
    "inclusion of friction is quite well possible @xcite , leading to a substantial complication in the calculation , while adding little to the understanding of the mechanism .",
    "we start the discussion with the elementary process of one domino colliding with another at distance @xmath5 and tumbling together downwards .",
    "this provides the setting for the longer train of falling dominoes .",
    "the dimensions of the dominoes are denoted by height @xmath6 , the thickness @xmath7 and the width @xmath8 .",
    "we will consistently work with dimensionless distances to ease the calculations .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 hardly enters in the calculation .",
    "the width is only co - determinant for the mass @xmath10 of the dominoes . as in all gravitational phenomena ,",
    "the total mass of the object drops out of the equations , but not the mass distribution .",
    "we consider two ( extreme ) cases : @xmath11 , referring to massive dominoes where the mass is proportional to the volume and @xmath12 , referring to hollow dominoes , with a mass proportional to the surface .",
    "the latter case seems curious , because standard dominoes are massive .",
    "however in an attempt to topple a very large domino @xcite , the larger dominoes have to be hollow for practical reasons .",
    "as mentioned the dominoes and their mutual distance all have the same aspect ratios : @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which is taken equal to the ratio of standard dominoes .",
    "each new domino is @xmath0 times larger than its predecessor .",
    "one could consider varying @xmath5 and @xmath0 ; it would make the discussion considerably more involved and not so much richer , since we investigate the largest possible magnification factor and it turns out that this occurs at a well defined value of @xmath5 .",
    "so deviating from the optimal @xmath5 and @xmath0 makes the domino effect less effective .",
    "restricting ourselves to the scale invariant case allows to discuss only one cycle in the domino effect , all the others are similar .",
    "a dimensionless time is somewhat more delicate .",
    "the natural time unit reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the moment of inertia of the foremost domino .",
    "this is the appropriate time scale for one cycle , the next is a factor @xmath17 larger , the previous a factor @xmath17 smaller . in the formulas we will not express time in terms of the unit @xmath18 , as this complicates the connection between different cycles .    the description of the train of falling dominoes centers around the tilt angle @xmath4 of the foremost domino as function of the time @xmath19 .",
    "it starts at @xmath20 and ends at @xmath21 at collision angle @xmath22 , where the foremost domino looses its role as head of the falling train of dominoes .",
    "@xmath23 is given by @xmath24 after @xmath23 , the domino continues to fall , but it becomes a slave , just as the previous domino was of the foremost .",
    "we number the dominoes with respect to the foremost falling domino , which gets the number 0 , or by default no number .",
    "so @xmath25 is the tilt angle of the foremost domino , @xmath26 that of its predecessor and so on .",
    "the calculation of @xmath21 gives the propagation speed of the domino effect .",
    "it is of no concern here .",
    "we only note that @xmath21 will be proportional to @xmath18 defined in ( [ a1 ] ) and therefore @xmath21 will increase with a factor @xmath17 in every cycle .",
    "this slowing down of each cycle is the beauty of the record attempt @xcite , where one can see _ ad oculos _ the details of a cycle .",
    "the derivative of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath19 is the angular velocity @xmath27 as long as @xmath28 is positive the domino train proceeds .",
    "so the question is whether @xmath28 remains positive till the foremost collides with the next one . in order to calculate @xmath28",
    "we have to understand what happens during a collision and what is the equation of motion between collisions . the central function in this calculation",
    "is the relation between the angle @xmath26 of domino 1 as function of the angle @xmath4 of the leading domino 0 .",
    "we start the discussion with two dominoes 0 and 1 . to ease the notation we replace from now on @xmath29 by @xmath5 and @xmath30 by @xmath7 .",
    "consider domino 1 , freely rotating towards the still upright domino 0 . in order that domino 1 keeps moving",
    ", the initial push must be large enough to overcome the point of highest potential energy , occuring at the angle @xmath31 , given by @xmath32 here we assume that domino 1 reaches this point before that it hits domino 0 .",
    "so we must have @xmath33 . with ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ b1 ] )",
    "this implies @xmath34 provided that @xmath5 fulfils this criterion , we find for the maximum potential energy @xmath35 under marginal circumstances , domino 1 has a vanishing rotation at this point and thus is its total energy also @xmath36 .",
    "while falling the potential energy decreases and reaches at the collision angle @xmath23 the value @xmath37 the energy difference is converted into kinetic energy . at the collision",
    "the kinetic energy amounts @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the moment of inertia of domino 1 .",
    "so the angular velocity at the collision is given by ( with @xmath40 the time scale ( [ a1 ] ) for domino 1 ) @xmath41 we consider the collision as instantaneous .",
    "domino 0 gets an impuls @xmath42 from 1 , changing the angular velocity of domino 0 abruptly from 0 to @xmath43 , given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the arm of the torque exerted on domino 0 . through the principle action",
    "is reaction , domino 0 gives an impuls @xmath46 to domino 1 , such that its angular velocity changes from @xmath47 instantaneously to @xmath43 ( as we will see in a moment ) .",
    "so we have the equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the moment arm of the torque on domino 1 with respect to its turning point . for the computation of @xmath45 and @xmath49 we have to rely on the goniometry between touching dominoes which is sketched in fig .",
    "[ dominoes ] .",
    ".goniometric relations referring to fig .",
    "[ gonio ] [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     the various goniometric relations are explained in table [ gonio ] .",
    "the basic relation between the angle @xmath26 and @xmath4 follows by equating the given expression for bc and for bc as bd@xmath50 @xmath51 it is a direct consequence of the condition that the dominoes lean on each other after a collision .",
    "( [ b8 ] ) defines @xmath26 as a function @xmath52 of @xmath4 in the interval @xmath53 .",
    "the moment arms @xmath45 and @xmath49 , as defined in table [ gonio ] , are obviously equal at collision where @xmath54 .",
    "the angular velocity of domino 1 just after collision , equals that of domino 0 . to see this we have to determine the relation between @xmath55 and @xmath28 , when the motion of domino 1 is a slave of domino 0 .",
    "generally holds @xmath56 the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument and is used for shortness .",
    "differentiation of ( [ b8 ] ) with respect to @xmath4 gives @xmath57 the last equality is demonstrated in table [ gonio ] . using this relation for @xmath54 , where @xmath58 , leads to @xmath59 , showing that the two angular velocities are equal at collision .",
    "we use arguments for the angle @xmath4 and subscripts for corresponding time .",
    "so @xmath47 , in ( [ b5 ] ) , is the angular velocity of domino 1 just before the collision with 0 and @xmath60 is its value just after the collision has taken place .",
    "the equality @xmath58 ( at collision ) makes it easy to eliminate the impuls @xmath42 , yielding the following relation between @xmath43 and @xmath47 @xmath61 here we see that the ratio of the moments of inertia of the two dominoes is the important ingredient for the collision .",
    "it equals @xmath62 with @xmath11 for massive dominoes and @xmath12 for hollow dominoes .",
    "now @xmath43 must be large enough to get the combination of the two sliding dominoes over the maximum of their combined potential energy , which equals @xmath63.\\ ] ] note that domino 1 weighs by a factor @xmath64 less in the sum .",

    "we now have sufficient equations to determine maximum factor @xmath0 still allowing the domino 1 to topple over domino 2 : the expression ( [ b5 ] ) for @xmath47 , the relation ( [ b11 ] ) between @xmath43 and @xmath47 and the condition ( [ b13 ] ) for @xmath43 .",

    "the bound following from this condition is too restrictive in practice .",

    "<S> the conditions are investigated under which a row of increasing dominoes is able to keep tumbling over . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is restricted to the simplest case of frictionless dominoes that only can topple not slide . </S>",
    "<S> the model is scale invariant , i.e. dominoes and distances grow in size at a fixed rate , while keeping the aspect ratios of the dominoes constant . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal magnification factor for which a domino effect exist is determined as a function of the mutual separation . </S>"
