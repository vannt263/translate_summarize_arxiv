    "the rapid proliferation of wireless devices and related service results in the recent exploding demand on extra frequency bands . because available frequency bands are limited , spectral efficiency becomes a key design criterion of wireless communication systems .",
    "full - duplex ( fd ) operation has received a great attention since theoretically it is able to double spectral efficiency compared to half - duplex ( hd ) operation . in fd operation , presuming the self - interference ( si ) from the transmitted signal is properly suppressed , simultaneous transmission and reception are allowed in the same frequency band . to make fd communication viable , si cancellation techniques are essential , and fortunately the recent advancement of si cancellation techniques sheds light on practical feasibility of fd communication @xcite@xcite . some experimental results based on the advanced si suppression techniques demonstrated a possibility of fd communication in real environments @xcite@xcite . in @xcite , an adaptive cancellation scheme was proposed to overcome some practical limitations of the previous si cancellation schemes . a combination of passive si suppression and active si cancellation was shown to achieve 74 db suppression of si on average @xcite .",
    "fd communication can be leveraged by beamforming with multiple antennas @xcite .",
    "there exists residual si due to imperfect si suppression , and beamforming can be exploited to address the residual si . in particular , to maximize sum rate of a fd system , beamforming has to balance between residual si suppression and information transfer . in bi - directional communications ,",
    "an iterative precoding technique based on sequential convex programming ( scp ) was developed to balance sum rate maximization and si suppression , using appropriate weighting factors @xcite . in fd multiuser network where a fd base station ( bs ) concurrently serves uplink hd users and downlink hd users in the same frequency band , the base station suffers from si and the downlink users",
    "are interfered by the transmitted signals of the uplink users , i.e. , co - channel interference ( cci ) .",
    "if the downlink transmit power increases to combat cci perceived at the downlink users , si also increases at the base station and thus the uplink sum rate decreases . on the other hand ,",
    "if the uplink users increase transmit power against si at the base station , cci increases at the downlink users .",
    "thus , in the fd multiuser network , transmission strategies at the base station and the uplink users are coupled and have to be designed to address both cci and si simultaneously , which poses a jointly coupled optimization problem . in @xcite , as a simplified problem for the fd multiuser system , single antenna users were considered when the base station performs linear beamforming for the downlink users and non - linear multiuser detection , i.e. , minimum mean - square - error successive interference cancellation ( mmse - sic ) , for the uplink users .",
    "then , the downlink beamformer design problem was formulated as a rank-1 constrained optimization problem and suboptimal solutions were presented based on rank relaxation and approximations .",
    "multiple antenna in full duplex multiuser systems ( fd mu - mimo ) were studied in @xcite@xcite .",
    "uplink beamformer design and downlink power allocation addressing si at the base station ( bs ) was studied in @xcite .",
    "however , cci was discarded and zero - forcing ( zf ) downlink beamforming at bs was assumed for simplicity , albeit its suboptimality . in @xcite , both cci and si were considered but with the assumption of large scale mimo , zf downlink beamforming was simply used for si suppression while treating cci as a background noise .",
    "the authors of @xcite addressed si and cci simultaneously based on scp algorithms in linear beamformer design .    in this paper ,",
    "when the uplink users and the downlink users have multiple antennas in the fd multiuser system , we explore novel transmission strategies at the base station and the uplink users in terms of maximizing sum rate of the uplink and downlink users . to this end",
    ", we formulate a joint beamformer design problem to maximize sum rate , i.e. , a joint transmit covariance matrix design problem , modeling the coupled effects between si and cci . however , the optimization problem is non - convex and not easy to find the optimal transmit covariance matrices due to the coupled si and cci . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we exploit the duality between broadcast channel ( bc ) and multiple access channel ( mac ) @xcite and reformulate the sum rate maximization problem as an equivalent optimization problem for mac .",
    "although the reformulated problem is still non - convex , the objective is represented as a difference of two concave functions and then , using the minorization maximization ( mm ) algorithm based an affine approximation , the objective can be approximated as a concave function .",
    "accordingly , we solve the problem with disciplined convex programming ( dcp ) using cvx program @xcite . in addition , without any approximation of the objective function and thus performance degradation , we develop an alternating iterative water - filling ( iwf ) algorithm to solve the non - convex problem . the proposed algorithm is based on the iterative water - filling algorithm @xcite which is known to provide the optimal transmit covariance matrices for mac .",
    "the proposed algorithms ensure fast convergence and low computational complexity . compared to @xcite and",
    "@xcite which address si and cci simultaneously as in our paper , the design approach differs ; in @xcite and @xcite , uplink and downlink linear beamformers were developed with the scamp algorithm and the cvx solver , both of which are based on the scp approach . on the contrary",
    ", our non - linear beamformer design is based on dirty paper coding in downlink and mmse - sic in uplink , which are known as capacity achieving schemes in downlink mu - mimo and uplink mu - mimo , respectively , and the transmit covariance matrices are found with the proposed algorithms based on the mac - bc duality .",
    "the proposed mm algorithm differs from the algorithms in @xcite and @xcite in the respect that it is used for non - linear beamforming , although it is also based on the scp approach .",
    "moreover , since the dc - based algorithms using affine approximations can suffer from information loss , we proposed the alternating iterative water - filling algorithm enabled by the mac - bc duality , which does not rely on cvx solver requiring long computational time .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sys_model ] , we describe the system and channel model and then formulate the design problem .",

    "<S> we solve a sum rate maximization problem of full - duplex ( fd ) multiuser multiple - input multiple - output ( mu - mimo ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> since additional self - interference ( si ) in the uplink channel and co - channel interference ( cci ) in the downlink channel are coupled in fd communication , the downlink and uplink multiuser beamforming vectors are required to be jointly designed . </S>",
    "<S> however , the joint optimization problem is non - convex and hard to solve due to the coupled effect . to properly address the coupled design issue , we reformulate the problem into an equivalent uplink channel problem , using the uplink and downlink channel duality known as mac - bc duality . then , using minorization maximization ( mm ) algorithm based on an affine approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a solution for the reformulated problem . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , without any approximation and thus performance degradation , we develop an alternating algorithm based on iterative water - filling ( iwf ) to solve the non - convex problem . the proposed algorithms warrant fast convergence and low computational complexity .    full - duplex , multiuser , mimo , beamforming , duality , difference of concave functions , iterative water - filling . </S>"
