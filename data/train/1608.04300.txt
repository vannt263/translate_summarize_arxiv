    "as per national cancer institute , in the u.s . , breast cancer is the second most common non - skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer - related death in women ; and , therefore , there has always been a high demand for novel breast cancer therapies . at the time of preparing this manuscript , 175 phase iii breast cancer studies were actively recruiting patients . for breast cancer therapies ,",
    "the main goal is to improve overall survival and quality of life @xcite .",
    "us fda guideline @xcite states that `` [ overall ] survival is considered the most reliable cancer endpoint '' . due to the advancement in metastatic breast cancer management and therapies ,",
    "there has been marked improvement in overall survival in breast cancer patients in the last few decades . as a result",
    ", there are practical limitations including the need of larger sample size and larger follow - up time @xcite and , surrogate endpoints such as progression - free survival ( pfs ) or objective response rate ( orr ) are being increasingly used for accelerated approvals , with pfs being the one used most often @xcite .",
    "the basis for using pfs as surrogate endpoint for os is as follows : cancer progression represents an ominous march toward death from malignancy .",
    "hence , longer it takes the cancer to progress , the longer a patient will live @xcite .",
    "however , pfs has not been statistically validated for surrogacy of os yet @xcite .",
    "+ according to prentice s definition@xcite , in order pfs to be a `` statistically validated '' surrogate endpoint for os , ",
    "test for null hypothesis of no treatment effect in pfs \" should be a valid ",
    "test for null hypothesis of no treatment effect in os \" .",
    "the test for treatment effect on os is carried out by testing hr@xmath0=1 , where hr@xmath0 is the hazard ratio ( hr ) of overall survival . however , many randomized clinical trials failed to demonstrate significant treatment effect in os despite demonstrating significant treatment effect in pfs .",
    "the current project attempts to investigate this from a diagnostic testing perspective , using nonparametric receiver - operating characteristic ( roc ) curves and classification tree .",
    "it is important to note that our investigation differs from previous investigations @xcite based on meta - analytic methods , where the primary purpose was to examine the strength of treatment effect on pfs to predict treatment effect on os at trial level .",
    "the analysis formulation in the current investigation is intuitive and aligned with the ultimate question that all stakeholders , regulators in particular , are often seeking an answer to , from a phase iii cancer clinical trial  is there a statistically significant overall survival benefit in the new treatment that is discernible from the data on progression - free survival ( pfs ) in metastatic breast cancer studies ?",
    "+ we have used nonparametric receiver - operating characteristic ( roc ) curves and classification tree approach to address this question .",
    "both the approaches are non - parametric and are free from the often unverifiable modeling assumptions of the standard meta - analytic methods .",
    "further , classification tree results are easy to interpret , and offers granular visualization of the results .",
    "we have utilized classification tree to answer following questions : ( a ) which trial level measure of treatment benefit in pfs has stronger association with significant hr@xmath0 ( hr of os ) in favor of treatment ",
    "( hr of pfs ) or ( % ) median improvement in pfs ? ( b ) is there any other factor(s ) ( e.g. , total number of deaths ) that influence significance of hr@xmath0 ?",
    "( c ) if yes , then how this measure modifies the association of treatment benefit in pfs with significant hr@xmath0 ?",
    "for this project , breast cancer studies were our focus , but the similar investigation can be carried out for other indications as well . throughout the article , ( unless otherwise mentioned ) , ` statistically significant ' would imply that the significance was in favor of the treatment .",
    "a systematic literature search in pubmed ( july 2015 ) was performed to identify published prospective studies on metastatic breast cancer research with both pfs and os comparison results reported .",
    "the search criteria were as follows : ( i ) title includes the phrase `` breast cancer '' , ( ii ) the term `` randomized '' is in title or abstract , ( iii ) the phrase `` progression free survival '' and `` overall survival '' are mentioned in the text [ criteria : breast cancer ( in title ) , randomized ( in title or abstract ) , progression free survival ( in text word ) and overall survival ( in text word ) ] .",
    "the pubmed search returned 181 publications between jul-2000 and jul-2015 .",
    "many of these studies were systematic literature review or meta - analyses and hence dropped .",
    "further , studies with either pfs or os not reported were also excluded . in one publication , instead of pfs , time to progression ( ttp ) was reported and that study was dropped .",
    "finally , we were able to find 64 individual prospective studies @xcite where both pfs and os comparison results were reported .",
    "the majority of these articles were published in the journal of clinical oncology ( 28 ; 43% ) , annals of oncology ( 10 ; 15% ) and breast cancer research treatment ( 10 ; 15% ) table [ table1 ] .",
    "majority ( 43 , 67% ) of these studies recruited patients to treat as first line therapy .",
    "forty ( 63% ) of these studies where phase iii . in 59 studies comparison",
    "was made with active control , in 2 studies comparison was made with placebo and in remaining 3 studies standard care was used as comparator .",

    "therefore , we had total of 73 treatment - to - control comparison available for the meta - analyses . for each treatment - to - control comparisons , following information",
    "were extracted : randomization status , blinding status ( open or blinded ) , total sample size ( treatment plus control ) , total number of events ( treatment plus control ) , median pfs , median os , hr ( hazard ratio ) in pfs ( hr@xmath1 ) , hr in os hr@xmath0 , reported p - value ( or significance status ) for hr@xmath1 and reported p - value ( or significance status ) for hr@xmath0 . in case both local and central pfs assessments were reported , the one which was reported as primary endpoint was considered .",
    "treatments effects on pfs were determined using following comparative measures : hazard ratio ( hr@xmath1 ) , increase in median pfs ( @xmath2med@xmath1 ) and % increase in median pfs ( % @xmath2med@xmath1 ) .",
    "all these 3 comparative pfs measures were used as diagnostic measures for predicting statistically significant hr@xmath0 in favor of treatment ( yes / no ) .",
    "+ diagnostic accuracy of comparative pfs measures ( hr@xmath1 , @xmath2med@xmath1 and % @xmath2med@xmath1 ) in predicting significant hr@xmath0 was assessed using roc curve @xcite based on logistic regression and classification tree ( cart ) @xcite approaches .",
    "empirical roc curves were drawn plotting the true positive rate ( proportion of correct prediction of significant hr@xmath0 based on comparative pfs measure among those reporting significant treatment effect on hr@xmath0 ) against the false positive rate ( proportion of wrong prediction of significant hr@xmath0 based on pfs measure among those reported non- significant treatment effect on hr@xmath0 ) .",

    "characteristics of these comparisons are summarized in table [ table2 ] .",
    "of 73 comparisons , 72 ( 98.6% ) were made in randomized set - up and 46 ( 63.0% ) were based on phase iii trials . only 15 ( 20.5% ) comparisons were reportedly carried out in blinded fashion and for 20 ( 27.4% ) comparisons , blinding status was not reported .",
    "the median total sample size was 231 and the median number of deaths reported was 59 .",
    "the median hr@xmath1 and hr@xmath0 were 0.78 and 0.85 , respectively .",
    "further , on average , median pfs times was increased by 1.60 months which translates to 28.41% increase in median pfs time .",
    "of the 73 comparisons , significant ( at 5% level ) hr@xmath1 and hr@xmath0 were reported in 32 ( 43.8% ) and 16 ( 21.9% ) cases , respectively ( see table [ table3 ] ) .",
    "the comparisons with significant hr@xmath1 are 5.55 times more likely to have significant hr@xmath0 compared to the cases where hr@xmath1 was not reported as significant .",
    "however , more importantly , only 37.5% ( 12/32 ) of comparisons with significant hr@xmath1 also reported significant hr@xmath0 .       at 5% level of significance .",
    "treatments effects on pfs were assessed using ( a ) hazard ratio ( hr@xmath1 ) , ( b ) increase in median pfs ( @xmath2med@xmath1 ) and ( c ) % increase in median pfs ( % @xmath2med@xmath1 ) .",
    "true positive rate was defined as proportion of correct prediction among the cases reported significanthr@xmath0 ) .",
    "false positive rate was defined as ( % of wrong prediction among the cases reported non- significant hr@xmath0).,width=377,height=680 ]    each of hr@xmath0 ( @xmath4 value=0.0447 ) , @xmath2med@xmath1 ( @xmath4 value=0.0109 ) and % @xmath2med@xmath1 ( @xmath4 value=0.0189 ) were found as significant diagnostic measure for predicting odds of significant hr@xmath0 in separate logistic regression analyses considering each comparative pfs measure as only predictor at a time .",
    "auc from roc curves based on diagnostic measure of hr@xmath1 ( auc=0.69 ) and @xmath2med@xmath1 ( auc=0.70 ) were numerically very close .",
    "however , % @xmath2med@xmath1 offers relatively better diagnostic accuracy with auc as 0.75 .",
    "+ from the roc curve of % @xmath2med@xmath1 in figure 1c , the optimal cut - off point ( according to youden s index ) is 44.83% , for which the sensitivity ( i.e. true positive rate ) is 81.3% and specificity ( i.e. 1-false positive rate ) 76.4% .",
    "it can be interpreted as follows : if we set a predictive rule to classify the cases with improvement in median pfs greater than 44.83% as producing significant hr@xmath0 subsequently , then 81.3% of cases reporting significant hr@xmath0 will be correctly predicted and 76.4% of cases reporting non - significant hr@xmath0 will be correctly predicted .",
    "another cut - off point of interest could be 33.33% for which the sensitivity is 87.5% and specificity 63.6% .          in classification tree approach , in addition to comparative pfs measures ,",
    "number of deaths and sample size were also considered as predictor variables .",
    "classification tree results based on 73 cases ( i.e. comparisons ) identified % @xmath2med@xmath1 and total number of deaths as diagnostic measures for significant hr@xmath0 .",
    "importantly , we found % @xmath2med@xmath1 as most important predictor variable compared to hr@xmath1 or @xmath2med@xmath1 .",
    "this is very much consistent with our findings observed in the analysis based on the roc curve .",
    "the _ bagging _ method also suggested that % @xmath2med@xmath1 as the most important and total number of deaths as the second most important diagnostic measures for significant hr@xmath0 + next , we performed classification tree analysis only on the 57 cases where information available for both % @xmath2med@xmath1 and total number of deaths .",
    "the classification tree results are displayed in figure [ cart ] . in 38 cases ,",
    "increases in median pfs were shorter than 48.27% ; and only 3 of these cases showed significant hr@xmath0 . in 5 cases , increases in median pfs were between 48.27% and 98.69% ; and only one of them produced significant hr@xmath0 .",
    "there were 14 cases with increases in median pfs reported at least 98.69% .",
    "of these 14 cases , in 9 cases total deaths were reported less than 227 and 4 of them reported significant hr@xmath0 . in remaining 5 cases",
    "total deaths were 227 or more and all of them reported significant hr@xmath0 .",
    "+ the findings of figure 2 can be summarized as follows : when increase in median pfs is less than 48.27% , it is unlikely that study would produce significant hr@xmath0 .",
    "when increase in median pfs equals or exceeds 98.69% , and minimum number of deaths is 227 or more then there is greater likelihood to obtain significant hr@xmath0 .",
    "that a substantial improvement in pfs should be predictive of a corresponding difference in os makes common sense . however , what is often not obvious is the magnitude of pfs difference that is required to be reasonably confident of observing a statistically significant hr@xmath0 .",
    "this is crucial in late phase trials where therapeutic agents are being tested and the sponsor needs to decide whether the observed pfs difference could be predictive of a significant and clinically meaningful difference in os and would merit a marketing authorization application ( maa ) .",
    "the roc and classification tree analyses employed here are very well suited for such a determination .",
    "for example , roc approach gives us an overall assessment of diagnostic accuracy based on the auc metric .",
    "on the other hand , tree approach is helpful in identifying non - linear association and influence of other factor , such as total number of death , in an interpretable and visible manner .",
    "both the approaches help us to choose an optimal operating point to guide the decision - making process .",
    "+ our study findings can be summarized as follows : first of all , @xmath2med@xmath1 ( i.e. percentage difference in median pfs ) is a relatively better diagnostic predictor compared to hr@xmath1 .",
    "this is suggested by both roc analysis and classification tree analyses .",
    "secondly , higher % @xmath2med@xmath1 tends to be associated with significant hr@xmath0 .",
    "however , our classification tree result suggests that higher number of deaths is also important in achieving significant hr@xmath0 .",
    "the fact that number of death influencing result of statistical testing of hr@xmath0 is very logical as deaths are considered as events in os analysis and increased number of events improves the chance of statistical significance [ i.e. , power ] in survival analyses .",
    "+ there have been numerous studies examining the strength of surrogacy and the ability of a surrogate measure such as pfs to predict os .",
    "most of the previous meta - analytic studies on metastatic breast cancer attempted to measure the association between improvement in os with improvement pfs and clinical benefit rate ( cbr ) @xcite .",
    "for example , miksad _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found only moderate correlation between hr@xmath1 and hr@xmath0 ( @xmath5 ranging between 0.35 to 0.59 ) in taxane and anthracycline based therapies in breast cancer patients .",
    "recently , amiri - kordestani _ et al . _",
    "( 2016 ) @xcite reported a moderate association between odds ratio ( or ) of cbr and hr@xmath1 ( @xmath6 ) , but failed to show any association with or of cbr with hr@xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) from 13 prospective studies submitted to fda .",
    "our work takes a markedly different path .",
    "first , we are interested in assessing the association of treatment effect on pfs with the ultimate interest being the observance or non - observance of a significant hr@xmath0 , whereas previous meta - analyses were more focused on exploring the association between the treatment effects on pfs and os .",
    "secondly , we have also considered pfs measures beyond hr@xmath1 such as @xmath2med@xmath1 ( i.e. difference in median pfs ) or % @xmath2med@xmath1 ( i.e. , percentage difference in median pfs ) .",
    "thirdly , we have used fully data dependent non - parametric approaches like empirical roc curves and classification trees for the meta - analyses which , as far as we know , has not been used before in applications of this type .",
    "fourthly , we have also included other factors such as total sample size and total number of death in evaluating the association between pfs measures and significance of hr@xmath0 .",
    "last but not the least , we have included a comprehensive list of all published studies since 2000 and hence number of studies included in this current investigation is relatively higher than previous published meta - analyses . +",
    "our study has its limitations .",
    "not all breast cancer studies published during the period under consideration could be included , although the number is still quite high compared to previous meta analyses .",
    "the selection of studies was driven by common - sense but objective search criteria which were rigorously applied .",
    "thus , only 73 treatment to control comparisons from 64 prospective published trials on breast cancer met the eligibility .",
    "the included trials were diverse in nature in terms of patient population considered ",
    "some examples of patient population are metastatic or advanced breast cancer patients , patients with at least two prior chemotherapies , anthracycline or taxane resistant patients , post - menopausal patients , her2 positive patients , her2 negative patients , just to name a few .",
    "thus , although the results are generalizable to the overall breast cancer population , they may not be applicable to all niche breast cancer populations .",
    "there is also potential for publication bias . to minimize the publication bias , we have considered all the studies which were published and listed in pubmed database and met our search criteria .",
    "lastly , we have not looked into other cancer indications , although we can not think of any reason why the method would not be a useful tool in assessing surrogacy of pfs ( or any other continuous time - to - event endpoint , or that matter ) + to conclude , empirical roc curves and classification trees could be useful tools for assessing how well treatment effect on pfs predicts hr@xmath0 in breast cancer studies .",

    "<S> * purpose : * pfs is often used as a surrogate endpoint for os in metastatic breast cancer studies . </S>",
    "<S> we have evaluated the association of treatment effect on pfs with significant hr@xmath0 ( and how this association is affected by other factors ) in published prospective metastatic breast cancer studies .    </S>",
    "<S> * methods : * a systematic literature search in pubmed identified prospective metastatic breast cancer studies . </S>",
    "<S> treatments effects on pfs were determined using hazard ratio ( hr@xmath1 ) , increase in median pfs ( @xmath2med@xmath1 ) and % increase in median pfs ( % @xmath2med@xmath1 ) . diagnostic accuracy of pfs measures ( hr@xmath1 , @xmath2med@xmath1 and % @xmath2med@xmath1 ) in predicting significant hr@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> was assessed using receiver operating characteristics ( roc ) curves and classification trees approach .    </S>",
    "<S> * results : * seventy - three cases ( i.e. , treatment to control comparisons ) from 64 individual publications were identified for the analyses . of these , </S>",
    "<S> 16 cases reported significant treatment effect on hr@xmath0 at 5% level of significance . </S>",
    "<S> median number of deaths reported in these cases were 156 . </S>",
    "<S> area under the roc curve ( auc ) for diagnostic measures as hr@xmath1 , @xmath2med@xmath1 and % @xmath2med@xmath1 were 0.69 , 0.70 and 0.75 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> classification tree results identified % @xmath2med@xmath1 and number of deaths as diagnostic measure for significant hr@xmath0 . only 7.9% ( 3/38 ) cases with @xmath2med@xmath1 shorter than 48.27% reported significant hr@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> there were 5 cases with @xmath2med@xmath1 greater than 98.69% and number of deaths reported as 227 or more  all of these 5 cases reported significant hr@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusion : * % @xmath2med@xmath1 was found as better diagnostic measure for significant hr@xmath0 . </S>",
