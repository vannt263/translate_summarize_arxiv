    "the canonical edwards - anderson ( ea ) model ising spin glasses ( isgs ) in dimension @xmath11 have been the subject of very many numerical studies .",

    ", there is now also general consensus concerning the low temperature thermodynamic limit ( thl ) behavior and exponents . in the bimodal case",
    "there is an `` effectively continuous energy level distribution '' regime coming down from high temperatures and ending with a crossover at a size dependent temperature @xmath2 to a ground state dominated regime @xcite .",

    "then we analyse the simulation data for other observables to obtain reliable and accurate estimates for the critical exponents of the thl regime , using both the conventional scaling variable @xmath14 and a novel scaling variable compatible with the generic scaling approach for isgs introduced in @xcite , adapted to a situation where @xmath16 .",
    "we find that the gaussian model and the bimodal model in the thl are not in the same universality class .",
    "the @xmath5d gaussian model is relatively clear - cut . because @xmath17 and the interaction distribution is continuous , there is a unique ground state ( for each sample ) and the low temperature excitation distribution has no gap .",
    "the fact that the ground state is unique necessarily implies that for all @xmath3 , as @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the reduced susceptibility @xmath20 . with @xmath14",
    "chosen as the critical scaling variable , the standard thermodynamic limit low temperature critical expressions are @xmath21 and @xmath22 because the critical exponent @xmath4 is strictly zero .",
    "the critical behavior of both the observables at low temperature is governed by the single exponent @xmath23 , which is related to the stiffness exponent through @xmath24 .",
    "accurate zero temperature domain wall stiffness measurements to large sizes @xcite show that @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 .    in the @xmath5d bimodal case the situation is complicated by two factors .",

    "with this assumption the @xmath35 regime will have `` effectively continuous '' energy level distribution critical exponents with an effective ordering temperature @xmath39 still zero .",

    "a major difficulty in establishing the limiting @xmath44 $ ] behavior for isgs in dimension @xmath5 @xcite consists in finding an appropriate and reliable extrapolation procedure from simulation data necessarily restricted in size and in temperature because of the need to achieve good thermal equilibration at large sizes .",

    "the usual observables were registered , the energy @xmath61 , the correlation length @xmath62 , the spin overlap moments @xmath63 , @xmath64 . correlations @xmath65 between the energy and some observables @xmath66 were also registered .",

    "the size dependence of the ground state energy per spin @xmath80 for the 2d gaussian isg has been shown @xcite to follow the simple critical finite size scaling rule @xmath81 with a @xmath82 consistent with the estimate from ground state domain wall stiffness measurements @xcite .",
    "standard scaling arguments @xcite would suggest that the low temperature specific heat should behave as @xmath83 but because of the continuous interaction distribution , in addition to critical excitations there are always single spin excitations .",

    "the gaussian data are almost independent of @xmath3 for the whole temperature range .",

    "for isgs with non - zero critical temperatures finite size scaling analyses at and close to the critical temperature are used to estimate critical exponents . for the @xmath5d bimodal isg , because of the crossover to the ground state dominated regime this approach is ruled out and the critical exponents must be estimated using the entirely different strategy of thl measurements .    the standard renormalization group theory ( rgt ) scaling variable for models with non - zero ordering temperatures is @xmath100 .",
    "this obviously can not be used when @xmath101 ; by convention the scaling variable used in the literature for @xmath5d isgs is the un - normalized temperature @xmath14 .",

    "below we will introduce another scaling variable appropriate for isgs with @xmath106 , but for the moment we follow this traditional @xmath107 @xmath5d isg convention .",
    "the critical exponents are defined through the leading thl expressions for the reduced susceptibility and the second moment correlation length within this convention : @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the limit @xmath110 .",
    "for all data which fulfil the condition ( either in the bimodal and gaussian models ) @xmath111 with @xmath112 , observables such as @xmath113 and @xmath114 depend on @xmath14 but not on @xmath3 , and so correspond to the thl infinite size values @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "it turns out that in the bimodal @xmath5d isg the thl limit temperature @xmath117 is always higher than the corresponding crossover temperature to the ground state dominated regime @xmath2 defined above , so the thl data are always well in the effectively continuous regime .",
    "the thl data extrapolation to @xmath118 corresponds to estimates for the critical exponents in the successive limits @xmath119 $ ] so in the effectively continuous energy level regime , to be distinguished from the exponents defined taking the successive limits @xmath120 $ ] which would correspond to the `` finite size '' ground state dominated regime .",
    "there have been many previous studies having the aim of estimating the critical exponents and in particular @xmath4 for the bimodal model .",

    "all the estimates quoted so far can be considered to concern the effectively continuous regime . at zero or low temperatures ,",

    "slight overshoots for each @xmath3 in both systems can be ascribed to @xmath113 and @xmath114 not reaching the thl condition at quite the same temperature .",
    "as stated above , very similar observations were made in ref .",
    "@xcite for the bimodal model .",
    "the present results thus confirm unambiguously that for the bimodal isg in the effectively continuous regime @xmath4 is not zero but is @xmath147 .",
    "thus the bimodal isg in the effectively continuous thl regime and the gaussian isg are not in the same universality class .",
    "it has been shown that in dimension @xmath148 also , gaussian and bimodal isgs are not in the same universality class @xcite , so the breakdown of universality in isgs appears to be general .",
    "estimating the exponents @xmath23 or @xmath149 is more difficult than for the exponent @xmath4 . as we have noted above , the standard rgt convention for models with finite temperature ordering",
    "is to use the scaling variable @xmath150 , which obviously can not be applied to models with @xmath151 , and for @xmath5d isgs the preferred convention in the literature has been to use the un - normalized scaling variable @xmath107 . in practice this is inefficient as the extrapolations towards the @xmath152 limit in order to estimate the values for the critical exponents are very ambiguous .",
    "for instance , when presenting @xmath14-scaled susceptibility data for sizes up to @xmath12 katzgraber _ et al _ @xcite state `` the [ susceptibility ] data for the bimodal case can be extrapolated to any arbitrary value including @xmath153 '' .",
    "we will introduce a novel scaling variable suitable for the @xmath5d isgs , applying the same principles as for isgs at higher dimensions @xcite , adapted to @xmath154 ordering :     for spin glasses the relevant interaction strength parameter is not @xmath155 but is @xmath156 , so the natural dimensionless parameter is @xmath157 ( or alternatively @xmath158 for bimodal isgs ) . with the standard normalisation @xmath159 the natural inverse `` temperature '' in isgs",
    "is @xmath160 , not @xmath15 .",
    "this was recognized immediately after the edwards - anderson model was introduced , in high temperature series expansion ( htse ) analyses for isgs including @xmath5d models @xcite , but has since been overlooked in most simulation analyses .",
    " it is convenient to choose a scaling variable @xmath161 defined in such a way that @xmath162 at criticality and @xmath163 at infinite temperature . with an isg ordering at a finite inverse temperature @xmath164 , @xmath165 is an appropriate choice @xcite .",
    "when @xmath166 as in the @xmath5d isg case , @xmath167 has been used @xcite , but here we will prefer @xmath168 as it turns out to be efficient and the limits are easy to relate to those of the @xmath14 scaling convention . with non - zero @xmath39 the effective exponents at criticality do not depend on the choice of scaling variable ; this is not the case when @xmath169 , but a simple dictionary is given below relating the limiting derivatives for @xmath170 scaling to the exponents for the conventional @xmath14 scaling .     the thl htse darboux @xcite format for observables @xmath171 is @xmath172 with @xmath173 in isgs @xcite .",
    "the htse isg susceptibility @xmath174 is naturally in this format , so for isg models with @xmath175 the thl susceptibility can be scaled in the wegner @xcite form @xmath176\\ ] ] because the correlation function second moment @xmath177 htse is of the form ( see ref .",
