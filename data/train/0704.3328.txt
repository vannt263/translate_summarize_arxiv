    "our understanding of how disk galaxies like our own or the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) formed plays a key role in near - field cosmology @xcite , because such nearby galaxies offer us detailed views of galactic structures through their resolved stars . in particular , the components of the extended low surface brightness stellar halo , old field stars and globular clusters , provide invaluable information on early chemo - dynamical evolution of disk galaxies over the past @xmath5  gyr ( i.e. , well before thin disk components appeared ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of galactic halos suggests that proto - galaxies were much larger than the sizes of currently bright galactic disks , possibly a result of hierarchical assembly of subgalactic systems orbiting at larger radii @xcite .",
    "the importance of accretion and merging of small systems in the galaxy formation process is also evident in the spatial and kinematic substructures in the galaxy s stellar halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the volume density profile of the milky way halo is characterized by an @xmath6 power - law of galactocentric radius , based on direct counts of halo tracers or their orbital motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , andromeda s spheroid appears to have a complex structure . in their imaging study",
    "@xcite found that the surface brightness ( sb ) profile along the minor axis is characterized by a de  vaucouleurs @xmath7 law over projected distances @xmath8 of @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( few pc to 20  kpc ) from the m31 center .",
    "later , @xcite reported , based on spectroscopic selection of red giant branch ( rgb ) candidates in several halo fields , that the sb beyond @xmath11  kpc shows a flatter profile with @xmath12 , and that the halo may extend to @xmath13  kpc .",
    "@xcite also found , from their photometry of rgb stars over @xmath1455  kpc along the minor axis , a comparably flat sb profile that is fit by an @xmath12 power law or an exponential law with a scalelength of 14  kpc .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this flat portion of the halo profile is affected by substructure , and if it is dominated by either metal - rich or metal - poor populations .",
    "the latter issue is especially important since spectroscopic studies suggest that m31 s inner spheroid / halo has a radial gradient in mean metallicity , whereby metal - poor stars dominate at @xmath15  kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "detailed studies based on large numbers of stars ( say from wide - field imagers ) are required to investigate the fundamental nature of m31 s halo along its minor axis .    in this letter",
    ", we report on our subaru / suprime - cam wide - field photometric observations of m31 s halo aimed at obtaining statistically significant sb and metallicity distribution ( md ) profiles along the south - east ( se ) minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "our imaging survey is optimized to extract halo profiles in a region that is well outside the bright disk component and beyond the inner spheroid with the @xmath7 brightness law .",
    "using the suprime - cam @xcite imager on the subaru telescope @xcite , which consists of ten @xmath16 ccds with a resolution of @xmath17 per pixel and covers a total field - of - view @xmath18 , we have carried out a wide - field imaging survey of m31 s spheroid .",
    "our targeted fields are located between 23 and 66  kpc from the m31 center ( fig .  [ map ] ) .",
    "during four nights in august 2004 , we obtained images of seven spheroid fields ( hereafter referred to as fields  17 ) and a control field in johnson @xmath0 and cousins @xmath1 bands with typical seeing fwhm of @xmath19 .",
    "these observations were obtained in non - photometric conditions .",
    "we carried out additional imaging of the same fields on a photometric night in august 2005 in order to calibrate the data .",
    "the data were reduced with the software package sdfred , a useful pipeline developed to optimally deal with suprime - cam images @xcite .",
    "photometry of our co - added images was calibrated through @xcite standards , correcting for an airmass term and a color term in each field .",
    "we then conducted psf - fitting photometry using the iraf version of the daophot - ii software @xcite .",
    "we adopted a 3  @xmath20 detection threshold for the initial object detection / photometry pass and iterated the psf - fitting photometry twice with 5  @xmath20 and 7  @xmath20 detection thresholds , respectively , in order to account for blended stars .",
    "a stellar psf template was derived from about 100 bright , isolated stars per image . finally , we merged two independent @xmath0- and @xmath1-band catalogs into a combined catalog using a 1-pixel matching radius .",
    "it is worth noting that the morphological segregation method can not distinguish between m31 halo stars and and other point sources such as galactic foreground dwarf stars , and compact extragalactic objects . to statistically remove these contaminations from the targeted fields",
    ", we adopted a control field located at a galactic latitude comparable to that of our targeted fields , on the assumption that it has the same abundance of foreground and background objects as that in the m31 spheroid fields .",
    "reddening corrections are applied in each field based on the extinction maps of @xcite , and the @xcite reddening law @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we adopt the m31 cepheid distance modulus of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 770 kpc ) from @xcite .",
    "we also note that our analysis of the sb and md profiles below is unaffected by photometric incompleteness : we target rgb stars brighter than @xmath25 22.5 ( mag ) , while our data are more than 90% complete down to @xmath25 23 ( mag ) . as an example , even if we count stars down to the 50% completeness for the @xmath0 band , the hitherto missing faintest and reddest stars are included in the analysis but the sb and md profiles are changed by less than a few percent .",
    "taking advantage of the large stellar samples available with the wide field of view of suprime - cam , we derive mds of rgb stars in m31 s spheroid , by comparing them to rgb fiducials defined by galactic globular clusters in the same manner as @xcite . for a reliable secure determination of mds using these templates , we select rgb stars with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these selection criteria allow us to remove a number of contaminants , such as m31 asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , agb bump stars , and young stars , along with foreground and background objects .",
    "we perform an interpolation procedure to obtain metallicities of objects in the spheroid and control fields , and subtract the derived md of the control field from that of the spheroid field in order to statistically remove the effects of the foreground and background contaminants . for more detailed description ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 ) together with the associated standard deviation , and the median metallicity together with the associated semiinterquartile interval . , width=321 ]    figure  [ fig : mdf ] shows the mds in fields 1 to 7 of m31 s spheroid .",
    "the vertical error bars denote a nominal uncertainty in each metallicity bin , yielding from the poisson errors equal to @xmath29 .",
    "it is worth noting that because of a large number of the rgb stars available from our suprime - cam data , the mds obtained here have significantly small errors and thus are expected to be most likely compared with the results of the previous studies , which examined more inner parts of the spheroid than ours @xcite .",
    "it follows that the mds have a broad distribution ranging from [ fe / h ] @xmath30 to the near solar metallicity .",
    "the average metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath28 ) with a standard deviation and median metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath31 ) with a quartile deviation are shown in each panel .",
    "in addition , our field 2 includes the field observed by @xcite , and the md of field 2 is almost consistent with their md .",
    "the most striking feature of the mds shown in fig .  [ fig : mdf ] is their overall similarity . for the sake of comparison of them ,",
    "we show their average metallicities as a function of distance from the m31 center in figure  [ fig : mdg ] .",
    "seven filled red circles present the average values of metallicity in our targeted fields , while many open circles are those in the subfields , which are obtained by dividing a single suprime - cam field into six fields ( 4000 pixels @xmath32 3000 pixels per divided field ) .",
    "these subfields help us to examine the fine spatial variation in a suprime - cam field .",
    "conversely , a filled red circle reflects the mean value of metallicities of six subfields .",
    "vertical error bars show standard deviation of the mean .",
    "these plot suggests that the stellar content of the spheroid has no metallicity gradient within our observational range",
    ". this may be consistent with the idea of chaotic merging of small building blocks first proposed by @xcite for understanding the lack of a metallicity gradient in the globular cluster system of the milky way halo .",
    "we estimate the sb profiles of m31 s spheroid along the se minor axis using the rgb stars , which are brighter than the agb bump ( @xmath25 23.3 mag ) . after extracting the secure rgb stars",
    "on which are imposed the same magnitude and color criteria as in preceding section , we divide them into the following two groups using the rgb templates of galactic globular clusters @xcite : _ metal - poor group _ ( mp ) defined as @xmath33[fe / h]@xmath34 and _ metal - rich group _ ( mr ) defined as @xmath35[fe / h]@xmath36 .",
    "the values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are both ends of the templates , and the template having a value of @xmath39 is chosen because it nearly marks a discontinuity in the mds obtained here .",
    "in contrast to the inner dense parts of the halo in m31 , it is possible to resolve the individual stars in its outer parts , because of their sparse density and of the sufficiently close distance of m31 to us .",
    "thus the sb profiles in spheroid s outer part are available by directly counting individual stars .",
    "the sources of noise in this method of estimating the sbs arise from the poisson statistics from the finite number of stars observed and contamination from galactic stars along the line of sight to the spheroid .",
    "the contribution from unrelated galactic stars can be estimated by observing other nearby fields : we use our control field at @xmath24 90 kpc to this end .    - and @xmath1-band minor - axis profiles for rgb stars as derived from the mp and mr group , while the right panel shows those based on the selection method of rgb stars by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band profiles are illustrated with blue and red points , respectively , which are derived from star counts in the magnitude and color selection boxes as described in the text .",
    "the error bars reflect a combination of poissonian and background uncertainties .",
    "the dashed lines show an exponential profile with a scalelength of @xmath40 kpc for mp and @xmath41 kpc for mr ( left panel ) , and @xmath42 kpc for blue rgb stars and @xmath43 kpc for red rgb stars ( right panel ) .",
    "the dot - dashed line in the right panel shows an exponential profile with @xmath44 kpc by @xcite , for the sake of comparison .",
    ", width=321 ]    the left panel of figure  [ fig : sb ] shows the sb profiles of the mp ( blue ) and mr ( red ) group , which are used to derive the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band profiles , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines show an exponential sb profile , @xmath45 , with a scale length @xmath46 of 21.9 kpc for mp and 70.0 kpc for mr .",
    "we note that at large distances @xmath8 , the number of rgb stars is just slightly larger than that of background objects , so we can determine only the upper limit for the most of their errors .",
    "it is remarkable that the sb in the mp group decreases more steeply with @xmath8 than that in the mr group , suggesting that as above stated there may exist a metal - rich substructure at @xmath47 kpc .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sb ] shows the sb profiles based on the different star selection by @xcite : using @xmath0-band and gunn @xmath48-band systems , they selected blue rgb stars with @xmath49 and @xmath50 and red rgb stars with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and derived the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band profiles from these categorized stars , respectively .",
    "we shift @xmath1-band magnitude criterion about 0.02  mag toward the fainter side in order to match the gunn @xmath48-band system .",
    "we note that our selection criteria for mp and mr are more advantageous than this fixed magnitude and color selection of blue and red rgb stars for investigating the effects of the mds on the sbs . to compare with the blue rgb star count profile in @xcite , which is fitted to an exponential profile with @xmath44 kpc , we shift it vertically to roughly overlap with our blue rgb surface brightness profile in the radial range @xmath53 .",
    "this result shows that stellar density at around 45 kpc and 60 kpc significantly exceeds a mean halo profile obtained by @xcite .",
    "hence , it is possible that two as - yet - unknown substructures consist of bright metal - rich stars .",
    "we note that the details of the sb profiles obtained here are found to be pretty insensitive even if we adopt much fainter @xmath0- and @xmath1-band magnitude limits , say down to @xmath54 mag and @xmath55 mag . thus , the current results are real and robust against the effects of any contaminations over the fields ; our deep suprime - cam data enable us to assess the minor effects of these errors .",
    "as fossil records of galaxy formation , m31 s spheroid offers us a global perspective about its spatial structures as well as stellar populations . based on a wide - field imager of subaru ,",
    "we have confirmed the previous results @xcite that the sb profile in the se minor axis is much flatter at @xmath56 kpc than the innermost part of the spheroid described by the @xmath7 law .",
    "our finding of no metallicity gradient in this outer part over @xmath57 kpc implies that dissipationless processes , such as accretion and merging of collisionless stellar systems , may have been at work for the formation of this spheroidal part , thereby erasing any metallicity nonuniformity .",
    "we note here that our control field at @xmath58 kpc of the se minor axis , which shows no substructures @xcite , may still contain some spheroidal stars , because m31 s spheroid may extend up to @xmath59 kpc @xcite .",
    "however , even so , the relative md and sb profiles obtained here remain unaltered .",
    "intriguingly , our finding of the possible overdensity regions at around 45 and 60 kpc is in agreement with the recent work by @xcite ( having appeared in astro - ph while preparing for the submission of our paper ) , who also found the stream - like features at similar locations , referred to as stream d and c , respectively .",
    "our metallicity analysis suggests that their stream d appears to be slightly more metal - poor than stream c. also , the mds of stream c ( our field 6 and 7 ) have a high - metallicity peak similar to those of the giant stream @xcite .",
    "however , it is yet uncertain if stream c is indeed related to the giant stream because of the lack of the information on the distance to stream c as well as its internal kinematics .",
    "deeper photometry down to horizontal - branch magnitude and/or multi - object spectroscopy of stars will be important for clarifying the origin of the newly detected substructures .",
    "our results reported here are not totally inconsistent with the finding by @xcite and @xcite , who argue for the presence of metallicity gradient obtained from their kinematical studies of the bright rgb stars using keck / deimos .",
    "indeed , only our field 2 overlaps field a0 of @xcite , where both fields yield basically similar metallicity , and other fields of field 2 to 7 along the minor axis do not overlap their survey regions ( see their figures 1 and 12 ) .",
    "it is interesting to remark that their field m6 at @xmath60 kpc along the minor axis shows rather high metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath61 , being similar to that of their field a0 as well as ours .",
    "in contrast , other fields deviated from the minor axis ( such as their a13 , a19 , and b15 ) show low metallicities , which basically give rise to the reported metallicity gradient .",
    "thus , this implies that the mds along the minor axis fields in concern may be somewhat different from other outer halo fields , i.e. , more higher surface density and more metal - rich than previously thought as reported here .",
    "a tempting view for these properties of our observed fields is that there exists a metal - rich substructure at @xmath8 of 50 - 60 kpc , corresponding to a faint tail of the giant stellar stream @xcite or a part of another stream .",
    "more extensive studies by observing large halo areas of andromeda , e.g. , using much wider hypersuprime camera under construction , will be necessary to arrive at more decisive conclusions and thus obtain the accurate formation picture of this typical disk galaxy .",
    "we thank the subaru telescope staff for the excellent support during our observing runs .",
