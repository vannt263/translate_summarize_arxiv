    "although the complexity of the response of materials to electromagnetic radiation has long been recognized , the subdiscipline of _ complex  mediums electromagnetics _ ( cme ) came into prominence only during the 1990s    as weiglhofer recently demonstrated in an extended review weigl . besides nonlinearity ,",
    "general complex mediums are not merely anisotropic , but are also magnetoelectric .",
    "plasmas , ferrites , isotropic chiral materials , structurally chiral materials , bianisotropic materials    all are excellent examples of linear complex mediums .",
    "some of these materials occur in nature , others are artificially made .",
    "add nonlinearity to the mix , and a bewilderingly huge palette of electromagnetic response properties emerges gsbook , lmbook .    while that stream of cme continues to flow unabated , a second stream of cme sprang in 2000 .",
    "this new stream initially contained quite simple mediums : isotropic and dielectric  magnetic , but with the phase velocity of plane waves therein being in opposition to the time  averaged poynting vector lmw03 .",
    "there has been some intermingling of the two streams pen , lm05 , but much of today s focus in the second stream is still on isotropic and dielectric  magnetic mediums .",
    "one current in that stream is the visualization of the negative  phase  velocity ( npv ) scenario by inertial observers that are moving at a fixed velocity with respect to a certain medium ( or vice versa ! ) .",
    "this is a sensible issue , as human vehicles continue to penetrate the universe beyond our planetary atmosphere mlcurr . in a predecessor paper npv_str",
    ", we theoretically demonstrated that isotropic dielectric ",
    "magnetic mediums which do not support npv propagation when viewed by a co  moving observer , _ can _ support npv propagation when they are viewed in a reference frame which is translating at a fixed velocity of sufficiently high magnitude .",
    "even more recently , we deduced the possiblity of orthogonal  phase  velocity ( opv ) propagation    a phenomenon characterized by the orthogonality of the phase velocity and the time  averaged poynting vector , when viewed by a non  co  moving inertial observer opv_str .",
    "in this paper , we report a comprehensive study of npv , opv , and the conventional positive  phase  velocity ( ppv ) propagation of plane waves in a simply moving , homogeneous , dielectric  magnetic medium that is isotropic with respect to a co  moving observer",
    ". the plan of this paper is as follows : section [ analysis ] is devoted to the minkowski constitutive relations and planewave propagation .",
    "section [ num ] contains numerical results for npv , ppv , and opv propagation in both dissipative and nondissipative mediums .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ con ] .    a note on notation : @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent the real and imaginary parts , respectively , of a complex  valued @xmath2 .",
    "the complex conjugate is written as @xmath3 .",
    "vectors are identified by bold typeface and 3@xmath43 dyadics are double underlined ; @xmath5 is a unit vector co  directional with @xmath6 ; the unit dyadic is @xmath7 ; and @xmath8 denotes the spatial coordinate vector .",
    "the permittivity and permeability of free space ( i.e. , vacuum ) are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively ; @xmath11 is the speed of light in free space ; @xmath12 is the angular frequency ; and @xmath13 . an @xmath14 time ",
    "dependence is implicit .",
    "let us consider a homogeneous , isotropic , dielectric  magnetic medium , characterized by its relative permittivity @xmath15 and relative permeability @xmath16 , in an inertial frame of reference @xmath17 .",
    "that is , the frequency ",

    "the inertial reference frame @xmath17 moves at constant velocity @xmath19 relative to another inertial reference frame @xmath20 .",
    "from the perspective of an observer located in @xmath20 , the medium is described by the minkowski constitutive relations hen , npv_str @xmath21 where @xmath22 the transformation from to is achieved via @xmath23 where @xmath24 .    in the remainder of this paper ,",
    "the propagation of plane waves in a medium described by the minkowski constitutive relations is investigated , with particular emphasis on the orientation of the phase velocity relative to the time  averaged poynting vector .",
    "the reader is referred to standard works hen ",
    "hun for background details on planewave propagation within the context of special theory of relativity .",
    "plane waves in the chosen medium are described by the field phasors @xmath25 our attention is restricted to uniform plane waves , as given by the wavevector @xmath26 where the unit vector @xmath27 .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath28 is generally complex  valued , i.e. , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    to calculate the wavenumbers , solutions of the form",

    " averaged poynting vector as follows :    * positive phase velocity ( ppv ) is characterized by @xmath44 , * negative phase velocity ( npv ) is characterized by @xmath45 , and * orthogonal phase velocity ( opv ) is characterized by @xmath46 .    as described elsewhere , the phenomenon of opv propagation arises for nondissipative mediums when @xmath47 opv_str .",
    "let us now explore numerically the occurrence of ppv , npv , and opv propagation within the parameter space provided by @xmath48 .",
    "the velocity vector @xmath6 is characterized by its relative magnitude @xmath49 and its orientation angle @xmath50 relative to the direction of planewave propagation , in the remainder of this paper .",
    "we begin by considering the wavevector @xmath51 .",
    "notice from that the wavenumber @xmath28 is a function of the product @xmath52 . in figure  1 ,",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath28 are plotted for nondissipative mediums with @xmath53 , for @xmath54 and the range of @xmath55 values given in table  1 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath28 is null  valued across much    but not all    of the range @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , at higher values of @xmath49 , @xmath57 for larger positive values of @xmath58 .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath59 can be either positive or negative  valued for @xmath60 , depending upon the magnitude and direction of @xmath6 .",
    "many schemes for materials satisfying the condition @xmath61 have been formulated rachford , sh03,po03 , although we must note that dissipation then is hard to avoid .",
    "the real part of @xmath28 in figure  1 becomes unbounded for @xmath62 , at points at which the denominator @xmath63 in vanishes . in view of our interest in the transition between ppv and npv propagation ,",
    "it is significant that @xmath64 changes sign as @xmath52 increases from @xmath65 to @xmath66 only for @xmath67 .    for dissipative mediums , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ;",
    "hence , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the wavenumber is plotted as a function of @xmath74 in figure  2    for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and the range of @xmath55 values given in table  1 .",
    "generally , @xmath78 is nonzero for all values of @xmath79 .",
    "as @xmath79 varies , strong resonances are observed in figure  2 for both @xmath64 and @xmath78 .",
    "notice in figure  2 that the real part of the wavenumber changes sign as @xmath80 increases from @xmath65 to @xmath66 only for @xmath81 .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that observed for the nondissipative scenario illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "let us now turn to nature of the phase velocity , as delineated by @xmath82 . in figure  3 the distribution of ppv , npv , and opv propagation",
    "is mapped out across the @xmath83 plane for nondissipative mediums with @xmath84 .",
    "the opv regime arises for @xmath85 and for large values of @xmath49 , spanning a range of values of @xmath55 which are symmetrically distributed about @xmath86 .",
    "the npv regime is restricted to @xmath87 for both @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we note that at @xmath90 , the regions of npv and opv both vanish , in consonance with the lorentz invariance of vacuum pappas .",
    "planewave propagation for the nondissipative scenario corresponding to @xmath91 ( not shown in figure  1 ) is opv in nature for all values of @xmath92 , since @xmath47 .    for dissipative mediums",
    ", the distribution of the npv and ppv regimes in the @xmath93 plane is displayed in figure  4 , for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath97 and @xmath98 , propagation is predominantly ppv in nature , with the npv regime limited to @xmath99 for large values of @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath100 and @xmath101 , propagation is predominantly of the npv type , with ppv propagation arising only for @xmath102 at large values of @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath79 and @xmath103 have different signs , and the imaginary parts of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are relatively small , then the distribution of npv and ppv propagation is evenly divided in the @xmath93 plane along the line @xmath86 .",
    "this even split between the npv and ppv regimes breaks down if the imaginary parts of @xmath15 and/or @xmath16 become sufficiently large .",
    "we note , in particular , from figure  4 that opv propagation does not arise for dissipative mediums .",
    "furthermore , there are no regions in the @xmath93 plane for which the sign of @xmath104 is indeterminate ; i.e. , both @xmath105 and @xmath106 always have the same sign .    in order to explore the orientation of the vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 relative to @xmath109 , let us introduce the angles @xmath110 in figure  5 , contour plots of the angles @xmath111 and @xmath112 are shown in the @xmath93 plane for @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . we see that @xmath116 and @xmath117 for all values of @xmath49 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the projection of the time  averaged poynting vector onto @xmath118 is always positive .",
    "therefore , npv propagation arises when @xmath64 becomes negative  valued .",
    "the vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 are close to being perpendicular to @xmath118 for large values of @xmath49 when @xmath55 takes values close to @xmath119 , in figure  5 .",
    "this is most noticeable when the imaginary parts of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are relatively small .",
    "we infer that _ nearly _ opv propagation is achieved for weakly dissipative mediums for large values of @xmath49 when @xmath55 is close to @xmath120 .",
    "it is clear from figure  5 that the orientations of @xmath107 and @xmath108 with respect to @xmath118 are generally very similar . in particular , for weakly dissipative mediums , the orientations of @xmath107 and @xmath108 relative to @xmath118 are almost the same across the entire @xmath93 plane .",
    "the occurrences of npv and ppv propagation are further explored in figure  6 , wherein the respective regimes are delineated as functions @xmath74 and @xmath121 for @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "when @xmath99 and @xmath125 is small , the predominant type of propagation is ppv for values of @xmath79 much less than zero but npv for values of @xmath79 much greater than zero . as @xmath49 increases , the npv regime expands , to the extent that when @xmath126 most of the @xmath127 plane supports npv propagation .",
    "the reverse situation is observed when @xmath128 : planewave propagation becomes increasingly ppv in nature as @xmath49 increases .",
    "the relative orientation angles @xmath129 of @xmath130 , @xmath131 , corresponding to the npv and ppv distributions presented in figure  6 , are provided in figure  7 .",
    "both @xmath111 and @xmath112 are acute across the entire @xmath127 plane .",
    "thus , our observation from figure  5 that the projection of the time  averaged poynting vector onto @xmath118 is always positive , is further confirmed in figure  7 .",
    "unlike the situation in figure  5 , the two vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 clearly have quite different orientations when viewed as functions of @xmath79 and @xmath132 . since @xmath133 and @xmath55 is not close to @xmath119 , the propagation represented in figure  7 does not approximate to opv in nature .",
    "from our numerical studies , for a simply moving , dielectric  magnetic medium that is isotropic in the co  moving reference frame , we conclude the following .    * whether the nature of planewave propagation is ppv or npv ( or opv in the case of nondissipative mediums ) depends strongly upon the inertial frame of reference that the observer is situated in . *",
    "the projection of the time  averaged poynting vector onto the direction of planewave propagation , as given by @xmath134 , is non  negative .",
    "ppv propagation is characterized by @xmath135 ; npv propagation arises when @xmath64 becomes negative  valued . *",
    "opv propagation only occurs for nondissipative mediums ; for such mediums it occurs when the imaginary part of the wavenumber is nonzero .",
    "weakly dissipative mediums support nearly opv propagation for large values of @xmath49 , when @xmath55 is close to @xmath119 . *",
    "the orientations of the component vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 of the time  averaged poynting vector are almost the same when viewed as functions of @xmath49 and @xmath55 , but the orientation of @xmath107 relative to @xmath108 is sensitively dependent upon the constitutive parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
