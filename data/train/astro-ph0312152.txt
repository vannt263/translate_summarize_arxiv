    "a new double neutron star ( dns ) system , j07373039 , was recently discovered ( burgay et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this is the fifth galactic dns ; all share the same characteristics of having eccentric orbits ( @xmath5 ) and short pulse periods ( 22  104 ms ) and low period derivatives ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the two latter parameters imply a weak surface magnetic field ( @xmath7  g ) which indicates that the pulsar has been recycled ( smarr & blandford 1976 ; alpar et al .",
    "1982 ; radhakrishnan & srinivasan 1982 ) , and that the observed pulsar in each system is the older neutron star and has gone through a mass - transfer phase ( srinivasan & van den heuvel 1982 ) .",
    "dewi & pols ( 2003 ) found that the wide - orbit dnss j1518 + 4904 and j18111736 are produced from helium star - neutron star binaries that avoided roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) ; while the close - orbit b1913 + 16 and b1534 + 12 can be formed either with or without a mass - transfer phase in the helium star - neutron star binary stage of evolution . among the five galactic dnss , j07373039 has the shortest spin period ( 22 ms ) , shortest orbital period ( @xmath8 ) , and lowest eccentricity ( 0.088 ) . in this paper",
    "we examine the possible formation history of j07373039 .",
    "we will show that unlike the other dnss , j07373039 can only be formed from helium star - neutron star binaries which have gone through rlof .",
    "we examine the formation history of the system is terms of the so - called standard scenario ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) , in which dnss were formed from be / x - ray binaries .",
    "when the be star leaves the main sequence and becomes a giant , a runaway mass transfer takes place due to the large mass ratio of the system .",
    "the neutron star is engulfed by the giant s envelope , and a common - envelope ( ce ) phase ensues in which the neutron star spirals down to the helium core of the giant , ejecting its hydrogen - rich envelope in this process .",
    "the outcome of this spiral - in is a very close binary consisting of a helium star and a neutron star ( hes - ns ) . for companions less massive than about 5  @xmath1",
    ", this mass transfer can still be stabilized such that the formation of a ce can be avoided ( e.g. king & ritter 1999 ; podsiadlowski & rappaport 2000 ; tauris , van den heuvel , savonije 2000 ) . however , for more massive companions such as the be stars considered here the formation of a ce can not be avoided .",
    "the helium star evolves further through core - helium burning and further burning stages . during this evolution",
    "it transfers mass to the neutron star by rlof and also loses mass by stellar wind .",
    "[ 0737:fig : presn ] depicts the parameters of these hes - ns binaries at the end of this rlof and wind mass loss , resulting from detailed evolutionary calculations ( dewi et al .",
    "2002 ; dewi & pols 2003 ) .",
    "the number indicated at each curve represents the initial mass of the helium star at the beginning of its evolution .",
    "the stars indicate the outcome of the evolution of systems with a range of initial orbital periods ( note that the lines connecting the stars are not evolutionary tracks ) .",
    "also presented in the figure are the maximum and minimum possible orbital periods of the progenitor of j07373039 just prior to the supernova ( sn ) explosion .",
    "these lines are derived with the assumption that the pre - sn ( circular ) orbital separation , @xmath9 , lies between the periastron and apastron of the post - sn separation , i.e. @xmath10 ( flannery & van den heuvel 1975 ) , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the post - sn separation and eccentricity .",
    "here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the parameters at the time when it was born , which is assumed to be a characteristic time ago , @xmath13 .",
    "these parameters were derived by integrating the effects of gravitational - wave radiation on the observed ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) over @xmath16 .    .",
    "the shaded area marks the region where the helium stars never fill their roche lobes .",
    "the maximum and minimum pre - sn orbital period of j07373039 are represented by the upper and lower thick lines , derived from the separation of the system at the time it was born , i.e. a characteristic spin - down time ago.,width=317 ]    dewi & pols ( 2003 ) found that systems represented with the open star symbols undergo a common - envelope ( ce ) phase due to the development of a helium convective envelope .",
    "the consequence of this is that , after the ce phase these systems will have a lower mass ( @xmath17  @xmath1 ) and much shorter orbital period ( @xmath18 ) than their original parameters shown in fig .",
    "[ 0737:fig : presn ] .",
    "hence , only the helium stars represented by solid star symbols ( i.e. with initial masses in the range of 4  6.5  @xmath1 ) are possible progenitors of j07373039 .",
    "this range of mass requires an initial progenitor main - sequence star of 14  20  @xmath1 .",
    "the region of the possible pre - sn orbital period @xmath19 limited by the two thick lines in fig .",
    "[ 0737:fig : presn ] does not cross the shaded area where the helium stars never fill their roche lobes .",
    "this implies that j07373039 can only have been formed through roche - lobe mass transfer from the helium star progenitor  as opposed to the other four galactic dnss which could be formed either via rlof or without a mass - transfer phase ( dewi & pols 2003 ) .",

    "this line gives a constraint on the maximum kick velocity , i.e. 230  @xmath4 .",
    "all five double neutron star systems ( dnss ) in eccentric orbits in the galactic disk share the characteristic of a combination of a weak dipole magnetic field ( in the range @xmath26 to @xmath27  g ) and rapid spin , indicating that we are dealing here with recycled pulsars that have been spun up during an accretion phase ( smarr & blandford 1976 ; alpar et al .",
    "1982 ; radhakrishnan & srinivasan 1982 ; srinivasan & van den heuvel 1982 ) .",
    "during such a phase with a non - degenerate donor companion the orbit will have been tidally circularized",
    ". therefore the present eccentricity of these systems can only have been induced in the second supernova explosion when the companion collapsed to a neutron star ( srinivasan & van den heuvel 1982 ) .",
    "the reduction of the magnetic field strength of the pulsar to a value around @xmath26 to @xmath28  g is thought to somehow be the result of the accretion , as there is an observed correlation between the amount of matter accreted and the field strength ( taam & van den heuvel 1986 ) .",
    "a simple relation for this case was derived semi - empirically , by shibazaki et al .",
    "( 1989 ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the present and initial magnetic field strengths , respectively , @xmath32 is the amount of matter accreted and @xmath33 is a constant to be derived from the observations .",
    "francischelli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found @xmath34 @xmath35  @xmath1  to agree well with the observed data for low mass x - ray binaries . adopting this value and a duration of the roche - lobe overflow phase of the helium star of @xmath36  yrs ( this is about the average value for helium stars in the mass range 4.0 to 6.3  @xmath1  ( dewi et al . 2002 ; dewi & pols 2003 ) )",
    ", with accretion at an eddington rate for helium ( @xmath37  @xmath38 ) one finds that @xmath30 can have decreased by a factor of about 50 during this phase alone .",
    "furthermore , a 15  @xmath1  be star resides @xmath39  yrs on the main - sequence .",
    "be / x - ray binaries tend to be transients ( rappaport & van den heuvel 1982 ; van den heuvel & rappaport 1987 ; zikowski 2002 ) and are `` on '' as an x - ray source only part of the time , during which they often reach a luminosity close to the eddington limit . assuming them to be `` on '' only one per cent of the time and then to reach the eddington limit , the neutron star will during the be / x - ray binary phase have accreted about @xmath40  @xmath1 . with eq .",
    "( [ 0737:eq : field ] ) this is already sufficient to reduce its magnetic field by a factor of about 100 .",
    "so , adding the amount of matter accreted during the be / x - ray binary phase and the rlof of the helium star , one finds with eq .",
    "( [ 0737:eq : field ] ) that these phases together provide enough accretion to reduce the magnetic field by a factor of about 200 .",
    "magnetic fields of young pulsars on average typically have a dipole strength a few times @xmath41  g , and after reduction by this factor will typically be around @xmath28  g , as observed in the five dnss . as to the spin - up of the `` old '' neutron star",
    ": during the roche - lobe overflow from the helium star accretion to the neutron star will have proceeded through a disk .",
    "the amount of angular momentum accreted during this phase can be calculated as follows .",
    "the mass transfer rate during roche - lobe overflow is highly super - eddington , in the range @xmath42  @xmath38  for helium stars in the mass range 4.0  6.3  @xmath1  ( dewi et al . 2002 ; dewi & pols 2003 ) .",
    "dewi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and dewi & pols ( 2003 ) in their calculations of the evolution of the systems during this phase assumed the accretion rate onto the neutron star to be the eddington rate ( @xmath37  @xmath38 ) and the super - eddington fraction of the transferred matter to be blown out of the system by the radiation pressure , carrying with it the specific angular momentum equal to the specific orbital angular momentum of the neutron star . following this assumption of accretion at the eddington rate  as radiation pressure will prevent accretion at a higher rate  and using the dipole strength of the magnetic field of j07373039 of @xmath0  g , one can calulate the value of the alfven - radius @xmath43 , where the matter becomes coupled to the magnetic field and starts to co - rotate with the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "@xmath43 is given by ( e.g. see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dipole field strength in units of @xmath26  g , @xmath46 is the neutron star radius in units of @xmath47 cm , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the accretion rate and the eddington accretion rate for hydrogen , respectively and @xmath50 is the mass of the neutron star . with the dipole field strength of @xmath0  g of psr j07373039 , the eddington rate for helium accretion @xmath51",
    "@xmath37  @xmath38  and a @xmath50 = 1.3  @xmath1  one obtains @xmath43 = 78.4  km .",
    "the rate at which angular momentum is accreted by the neutron star is then : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the keplerian angular velocity of matter in the disk at distance @xmath54 from the center of the neutron star . with @xmath55 , @xmath56  @xmath1",
    "one finds @xmath57 .",
    "the present spin angular momentum of the neutron star is @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the radius and spin period of the neutron star and @xmath61 is its radius of gyration , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath62 is typically about 0.075 for a polytropic index @xmath63 ( e.g. lattimer & prakash 2001 ) . with this value and @xmath64  km and @xmath60 = 22",
    "ms one obtains @xmath65 , which together with the above mentioned rate of accretion of angular momentum results in a required timescale for the spin - up of about @xmath66 years .    the duration of the phase of roche - lobe overflow in the helium star plus neutron star binaries with helium star masses between 4.0 and 6.3  @xmath1  ranges from 2.4 to @xmath67 years , which is of the same order as the value of @xmath66 years required for the spin - up .",
    "it thus appears that the magnetic field strength and spin rate of psr j07373039 fit quite well with evolutionary model presented here in which the immediate progenitor system was a very close helium star plus neutron star binary which evolved through a phase of roche lobe overflow with a duration of order @xmath68 years . as mentioned above , the progenitor of this system was so close that it can not have avoided the phase of mass transfer by roche - lobe overflow from the helium star ( dewi & pols 2003 ) , so here this phase must absolutely have taken place in the history of psr j07373039 .",
    "this may be the reason why the pulsar has the shortest spin period of all .",
    "the progenitors of the other systems may , in principle , have avoided rlof , although it can certainly not be excluded that also in ( some of ) them roche - lobe overflow from the helium star may have taken place .",
    "we have examined the formation of j07373039 . we find that this system must have gone through a mass - transfer phase from a helium star with the initial mass in the range of 4  6.3  @xmath1 .",
    "we also find that an asymmetric sn explosion with a kick velocity of 70  230  @xmath4  is necessary to explain the observed orbital parameters .",
    "however , these constraints may still be subject to some uncertainties . whether the neutron stars in the systems that go through a ce phase ( the open stars in fig .",
    "[ 0737:fig : presn ] ) complete the spiral - in in the envelope of the helium star depends on the competition between the spiral - in timescale and the time left before the explosion of the helium star ( dewi & pols 2003 ) . if the sn explosion in systems with open star symbols in fig .",
    "[ 0737:fig : presn ] occurs before the neutron star completes the spiral - in process , a lower kick velocity or even a symmetric sn explosion ( shown as the solid circle ) would then be possible .",
    "furthermore , the constraints on the maximum pre - sn mass and the maximum kick velocity depend somewhat on the assumed wind mass - loss rate and the loss of angular momentum during the rlof . as the stability of a mass - transfer phase depends on the mass ratio of the system and the period at the onset of rlof , applying a higher wind mass - loss rate results in a lower mass helium star in wider orbit , and hence , more stable mass transfer than adopting wind mass loss with a lower rate .",
