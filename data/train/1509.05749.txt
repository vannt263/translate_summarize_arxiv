    "observations of nearby star - forming regions have revealed how a low - mass star can form in an isolated environment . however , massive stars play a vital role in the star formation process in embedded clusters , yet their own formation and their effects on subsequent generations of star formation are not well understood .",
    "massive stars form relatively quickly compared to low - mass stars and reach the main sequence still embedded in their natal clump .",
    "the short duration of this phase means that these objects are relatively rare and thus typically more distant , making them difficult to study .",
    "in addition , the embedded clusters hosting those massive stars are hidden inside their natal molecular cloud and can only be observed at infrared ( ir ) and millimeter wavelengths .    the launch of the _ _ spitzer space telescope _ _ in 2004 @xcite has had a big impact on our understanding of the star formation process . many nearby star - forming regions ( e.g. taurus complex , m16 , m17 , ngc 6334 )",
    "have been studied @xcite , and many methods have been suggested and used to classify the young stellar objects ( ysos ) through their spectral indices @xcite or color@xmath0color diagrams @xcite .",
    "the combination of _ spitzer_-infrared array camera ( irac ) @xcite and near - ir data has been a powerful tool to identify and classify ysos .",
    "we performed a detailed investigation of the star - forming region , which is located within one of the most massive giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ; * ? ? ? * ) in the galaxy and hosts many massive protostars and clusters of young stars that are forming around them .",
    "since it is not possible to observe a single yso at various stages of its evolution , we have to observe large numbers of ysos to study the pre - main - sequence evolution statistically @xcite .",
    "the star - forming region was discovered as a radio continuum source by @xcite and lies in the galactic plane ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the gmc extends over more than 100  pc , assuming a distance of 11.1  kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived a total mass @xmath9 m@xmath7 within a radius 60  pc and @xmath10 @xmath11 within 6  pc from multiscale observations of co. they concluded that the mass reservoir of the molecular cloud is sufficient to form several massive star clusters , or a small system of smaller , but still bound , clusters .",

    "conclude that this double - peak line profile comes from different clouds and suggest that a cloud@xmath0cloud collision is triggering the massive star formation in w49a .",
    "@xcite found hot cores in the welch ring , which are probably the precursors of uchii regions .",
    "@xcite identified four massive stellar clusters based on the spatial distributions of the detected sources based on their ( @xmath18-@xmath19 ) colors , and they hypothesize that the w49 gmc collapsed to form the central massive cluster , and stellar winds and uv radiation triggered the surrounding the cloud to form the welch ring .",
    "however , they concluded that there is no evidence of triggering for the other clusters on the south and east parts of the region .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggested that the triggering in the region is caused by expanding shells in the center of w49n .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the mass distribution in the whole gmc and concluded that it shows a hierarchical network of filaments at scales from @xmath20 10 to 100  pc and suggested that the w49a starburst is formed from global gravitational contraction .",
    "they also concluded the feedback from the central young massive cluster is still not sufficiently strong to disrupt the gmc , and there is no evidence for significant disruption from photoionization .",

    "first , all sources detected by _ spitzer _ were matched to two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog @xcite sources by the photvis photometry routine .",
    "since we have catalogs for mosaics based on short ( 2 s ) and long ( 12 s ) frames , we ran a band - merging process and took all sources from the short frames brighter than a certain cutoff ( magnitude 9.6 , 9.4 , 7.5 , and 7.2 for channels 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively ) , which was chosen to be near but below the saturation limit of the 12 s frames .",
    "deep near - ir data are necessary , along with the irac photometry , in order to identify yso candidates from other highly reddened objects and to more accurately fit models of their seds .",
    "therefore , we used the ukirt infrared deep sky survey , dr7plus ( ukidss ) galactic plane survey @xcite data , which are deeper and have better spatial resolution than those of 2mass .",
    "we merged these data into our catalog using the topcat software @xcite pair match method with a maximum 1@xmath4 radial tolerance .",
    "we adopted ukidss data , where they exist , for sources with 2mass magnitudes fainter than the ukidss saturation limits , and 2mass data otherwise ( the ukidss cameras saturate near 12.65 , 12.5 , and 12 mag in @xmath29 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively ) .",
    "ukidss data have small uncertainties and small but measurable zero - point photometric offsets from 2mass .",
    "therefore , we calculated the mean and standard deviations of the magnitude residuals between 2mass and ukidss and applied a mean offset to ukidss data of 0.02 , -0.09 , and -0.04 mag in @xmath29 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively , to place them on the same system as the 2mass photometry . also , we found that the small photometric errors reported in the ukidss catalog ( e.g. , @xmath300.001 mag for 13 mag sources ) are probably unrealistic and have a detrimental effect on the source classification process .",
    "we therefore also adjusted the ukidss errors by adding 0.02 mag in quadrature to the values from the ukidss catalog before the source classification process .",
    "this imposes an error floor of 0.02 mag but does not affect the larger errors .",
    "we also used the mipsgal archive 24  @xmath21 m data @xcite and added them to our catalog by using the topcat software pair match method with a maximum 2@xmath4 radial tolerance ( since the resolution of the mips 24  @xmath21 m band is 6@xmath4 fwhm , the position errors can be higher than irac ) .",

    "broad - line agns have mid - ir colors that are largely consistent with ysos @xcite .",
    "therefore , the agns are classified by using the @xmath32 $ ] versus @xmath32-[8.0]$ ] color@xmath0magnitude diagram and a combination of six different conditions involving these two irac bands .",
    "we remove knots of shock emission and sources contaminated by pah emission using the @xmath32-[5.8]$ ] versus @xmath31-[4.5]$ ] color@xmath0color diagram and seven different conditions involving these three irac bands .",

    "the second step in the @xcite method is to classify the ysos with near - infrared data , and the third step is to reexamine the entire catalog with mips 24  @xmath21 m photometry . after we applied the full set of criteria , we ended with 73 deeply embedded near - infrared objects , 271 class i ysos , 3021 class ii ysos , and 231 transitional disk candidates .    in our analysis of the w49 data we had to take into account its greater distance and the possible higher level of contamination from objects such as agb stars , background sources , and other extragalactic contaminants that have probably been classified as ysos .",
    "since agb stars are bright and , in general , slightly bluer than ysos @xcite , we considered the bright ysos that also follow the following selection criteria as candidate agb stars :    @xmath34 < 9.5 \\text { and}\\ 0.2 < [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] < 1.25\\ ] ]    or @xmath35 < 9.5 \\text",

    "we report these additional yso candidates separately to denote the lower confidence in their identification but do not remove them from our catalog . with this criterion we flagged 64 class i , 1932 class ii , and 75 transition disk candidates with a `` uc '' mark in our catalog , as shown in table  [ sourcetable ] , and called them faint yso candidates .",
    "these faint yso candidate sources will not be used in the analysis described in section [ sec : analysis ] .    as a final step , we examined the regions near the yso candidate objects and eliminated 74 transition disk and 27 embedded source candidates if they did not appear as point sources in the mips 24  @xmath21 m images , seem like an artifact around a very bright source , or are significantly more extended than the fwhm for the @xmath38  @xmath21 m psf .",

    "in order to find the clusters , we used a method called mst @xcite , which uses the spatial distribution of sources to determine a cluster membership without any kinematic information .    the mst method defines clusters as a collection of stars that are connected to each other by branches smaller than the cutoff distance ( @xmath48 ) or branch length and with a minimum number of stars ( @xmath49 ) in a group .",
    "it has been a popular tool in recent years and has been used for many nearby star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "however , there is no unique way to determine a cutoff distance for a cluster determination .",
    "the most common way used for nearby regions is to plot the distribution of cutoff distances , fit straight lines through the long and short cutoff distance domains , and choose the point of intersection @xcite . choosing a cutoff distance that falls between these two domains is also a good way to separate clusters from distributed sources @xcite . with this method , @xcite determined the cutoff distance as 61@xmath4 ( 0.43  pc ) for the diamond ring region in the cygnus - x star - forming complex , which is at a distance of 1450  pc . on the other hand , @xcite derived the cutoff distance as 72@xmath4 ( 0.51  pc ) for the cygnus - ob2 region in the cygnus - x complex .",
    "all these values are smaller than the 88@xmath4 ( 0.86  pc ) derived by @xcite for the w5 star - forming region , which lies at a distance of 2  kpc , which may indicate that cygnus - x is more densely populated with ysos than w5 .",
    "@xcite used the mst method for nearby embedded star - forming regions by dividing each region according to their yso concentrations . for w5-east they found an average cutoff distance of 33@xmath4 ( 0.32  pc ) , which is different than the 88@xmath4 ( 0.86  pc ) that was found by @xcite for the whole of w5 .",
    "@xcite used the mst method according to the definition given in @xcite for galactic star - forming regions like w43 and vulob1 to derive their clustering properties and found cutoff distances of @xmath2080@xmath4 ( corresponding to 4.3  pc at the distance of w43 ) and @xmath20100@xmath4 ( 5.4  pc ) , respectively .",
    "these cutoff distance differences may be partly a resolution effect , since at greater distances multiple stars may blend into single objects , and fewer stars are detected owing to corresponding lower sensitivity in the more distant regions .",
    "low - resolution observations of distant star - forming regions probe only larger - scale structures , and it is hard to see the hierarchical substructure in these regions .",
    "in addition to galactic regions , the mst method has been used by @xcite for the star - forming regions in the m33 galaxy . in order to prevent an artificial length scale according to the resolution limit and seeing a large number of stars as blended or as single sources , they used cutoff distances from 5@xmath4 to 65@xmath4 ( corresponding to 19 to 252  pc assuming the distance of m33 as 800  kpc ) in 13 equal steps .",
    "examining the clustering at the different values allowed them to see all levels of hierarchy in m33 .      to compare with previous clustering analysis in nearby star - forming regions , we first use the straight - line fit method to determine the branch length cutoff for w49 .",
    "we plot the number of clustered objects versus branch length .",
    "branch lengths between 82@xmath4 and 130@xmath4 deviated significantly from linearity , so we masked these areas and found the intersection to the best fits to the long and short branch length regimes .",
    "we found a cutoff distance of 96@xmath4 , which corresponds to 5.2  pc at 11.1  kpc , similar to the cutoff distance found by @xcite for w43 and vulob1 .",
    "however , this cutoff distance shows that the straight - line fit method does not find the isolated subclusters , instead picking up almost the whole star - forming region with a diameter of 27  pc associated with the overdensity of ysos .    to determine the statistical significance of the w49 clusters identified with this cutoff distance",
    ", we performed simulations to examine the clustering properties of randomly distributed objects .",

    ", we plotted the number of groups containing seven or more stars versus cutoff distance from 1@xmath4 to 300@xmath4 , with steps of 1@xmath4 , in the right panel of figure  [ fig : mst ] .",
    "this comparison indicates that the largest group observed , cluster 1 , is likely formed from the extended yso population of w49 , representing a large - scale structure extending 26.86  pc in diameter .",
    "the lower - density clusters 2 and 3 observed with the straight - line fit cutoff distance of 96 @xmath4 have a higher probability of occurring randomly as a result of chance alignment of distributed ysos .",
    "to investigate the substructure within these clusters , we also investigated the number and size distribution of subclusters identified as a function of the cutoff distance used . for a random distribution ,",
    "the number of groups identified in the minimum spanning tree is a function of both the minimum group size and the cutoff distance .",
    "a long cutoff distance and small minimum group size will break the mst into a large number of small , more dispersed clusters .",
    "we examined the number and size distributions of clusters that would arise in a randomly distributed population of ysos to find the cutoff distance and minimum group size that yielded the largest number of groups that had a low probability of occurring randomly .",
    "we found that using a break length of 40@xmath4 ( 2.2  pc in w49 ) and requiring @xmath49  @xmath1  6 or more members isolates seven subclusters , a distribution that did not occur in the 1000 simulated randomly distributed trials .",
    "only @xmath52 of the random trials had at least one group of six or more members , and only @xmath53 of the random yso distributions had two groups , with no trials having more than two random groups .",
    "therefore , the random trials indicate that the identified subclusters likely represent physically associated groups of ysos , with a @xmath3010% likelihood that one of the subclusters could be a random association .",
    "note also that the subclusters identified are all within the three clusters identified with the larger break length and minimum cluster member number .",
    "however , owing to the complex line of sight toward w49 , without additional data to determine the distance to each object , we can not rule out the possibility that all of the clusters may not all be at the same distance as the w49 gmc .    according to the yso clustering analysis , identified",
    "subclusters in w49 have sizes of order a few parsecs in diameter with six to nine sources in each subcluster .",
    "on the other hand , subclusters identified in the cygnus - x dr21 region have 10@xmath0148 sources with diameters of 1@xmath08.1  pc @xcite .",

    "similarly , @xcite found subclusters in the w5 region with 10@xmath0201 sources with diameters of a few parsecs .",
    "w49 has smaller clusters with less members ; however , this might be a result of incompleteness .",

    "however , as we mentioned in section [ sec : comp ] , g305 has an older population with its two open clusters .",
    "this drop in class ii / i ratio in g305 and g333 regions after rescaling to the greater distance is mainly because lower - luminosity class ii ysos drop below our detection limits before class i ysos do , biasing our observations of distant regions toward younger objects .",

    "we used the cutoff distances and the ratio of class ii / i sources in each cloud in order to derive information about their relative ages and yso densities . in order to directly compare them , we determined the projected appearance of the g305 and g333 regions and compared the number and size distributions of the subclusters .",
    "we saw that there are more clusters in the w49 region , which indicates that w49 has the richest population of high - luminosity ysos .",
    "however , we could not use the ratio of class ii / i objects as an age indicator of clusters , since at greater distances we lose a significant number of older objects , which biases our observations .",
