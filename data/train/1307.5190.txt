    "a single layer of carbon atoms called graphene has become a very active field of research in nanophysics@xcite .",
    "graphene has excellent electrical and thermal properties , e.g. massless and chiral dirac fermions which move with a fermi velocity of about 1/300 the speed of light , a linear spectrum close to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points@xcite of the brillouin zone , anomalous integer quantum hall effect in the presence of a magnetic field , the klein paradox , i.e. unusual high transmission when electrons pass classically forbidden regions , aharonov - bohm effect in graphene rings , extraordinary stiffness , unexpected mechanical properties , and thermo - mechanical and electronic properties that are highly affected by external particles and dopants .",
    "these properties of graphene have attracted considerable attention and make it a promising material for future electronic and opto - electric devices .",
    "an interesting recent prediction is that a geometrical deformation of the graphene lattice results in local strain that acts as a pseudo - magnetic field on the electronic degrees of freedom and which leads to a pseudo - quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "deformation due to elastic strain changes the hopping amplitude of the carbon atoms and induces an effective vector potential that shifts the dirac points@xcite . with a proper geometrical deformation it is possible to create large pseudo - magnetic fields which can reach up to several hundreds of tesla@xcite . over the last few years much effort has been devoted to find ways of controlling graphene s electronic properties by strain .",
    "applying in - plane strain with triangular symmetry has been shown@xcite theoretically to result in an uniform pseudo - magnetic field of the order of @xmath3 t. it was reported experimentally@xcite that nanobubbles grown on a pt(111 ) surface induce pseudo - magnetic fields of more than @xmath4 t. landau quantization of the electronic spectrum was observed by scanning tunneling microscopy .",
    "thus , with such large strain - induced pseudo - magnetic fields , one can control the electronic properties of graphene through strain engineering@xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown experimentally that an external nonuniform electric field is able to induce local deformations in graphene with different curved shapes @xcite and thus one should be able to induce a pseudo - magnetic field through an electric field .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the different effects that are induced by inhomogeneous strain in graphene .",
    "we consider a hexagon shaped graphene flake that is strained out - of - plane by a gaussian bump placed in its center .",
    "the effects of strain in graphene can be modeled using a pseudo - magnetic vector potential . in the case of a gaussian bump , the traditional form of this vector potential@xcite results in a three - fold symmetric pseudo - magnetic field , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro_1](b ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown in ref . that additional lattice corrections are required in order to accurately calculate the pseudo - magnetic vector potential .",
    "however , these strain - induced lattice vector corrections do not contribute to the pseudo - magnetic field and may be neglected@xcite . only the strain induced hopping parameter changes will affect the intensity of the pseudo - magnetic field , but this is generally derived only up to first order in strain . given graphene s excellent mechanical properties , it can sustain strain up to @xmath0@xcite . at that point strain",
    "can no longer be considered to be small .",
    "for this reason , we investigate additional corrections to the vector potential to higher order in the strain and we compare this pseudo - magnetic field model to results obtained with the full tight - binding result .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the confinement of electrons inside the strained region . it was shown earlier , using the dirac equation formalism , that such a gaussian bump results in low energy localized states@xcite .",
    "however , those models do not fully explain the origin of the six - fold symmetry of the localized states .",
    "here we investigate the system using the tight - binding model and show that the influence of strain in the zigzag ( zz ) and armchair ( ac ) directions of graphene result in different pseudo - magnetic fields and consequently to different localization properties for the electrons .",
    "furthermore , we examine the energy levels and wave functions in order to show the different confinement regimes .",
