    "<S> although lfp signals recorded in motor cortex from electrodes separated by up to several millimeters are typically highly correlated @xcite , the analysis of the instantaneous phase of the oscillation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) revealed a non - zero temporal shift between electrodes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such shifts may be expressed by the formation of dynamic spatial patterns propagating along preferred directions across the cortical surface , referred to as traveling waves @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> to understand if there is a specific spatial patterning of the temporal lags between the signals on the different electrodes , we decomposed the beta - filtered lfp time series of each electrode @xmath14 into the instantaneous amplitude @xmath15 , corresponding to the envelope of the filtered signal , and phase @xmath16 of the beta oscillation by calculating its analytic signal ( see ) . </S>",

    "<S> time stamps are given relative to ts . ]    in contrast , the phase snapshots @xmath18 showed a pronounced structure that varied on a very fast time scale in the range of milliseconds ( d and movie s1 in the supplemental information ) . </S>",
    "<S> while we typically observed a smooth transition of maps between consecutive time points @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( given a sampling rate of @xmath7 ) , at some moments in time the maps changed their structure very rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite the rapid changes of the spatial structure of the maps and some discontinuities in their temporal evolution , many phase maps could clearly be classified by visual inspection into one of 5 distinct classes of spatial arrangements , in the following referred to as _ phase patterns_. representative examples of these classes of phase patterns and their temporal evolution over a time period of @xmath25 are shown in a , b . in order to better visualize and characterize these spatial structures , we here calculated the vector field of phase gradients @xmath26 and its spatially smoothed version , the phase gradient coherence @xmath22 , and display the gradient fields along with the phase maps . in the following we will briefly describe the classes of phase patterns in their most salient , idealized form .    the identification of traveling waves ( b , top row ) , comparable to the first report by @xcite , was most prominent . in these _ planar _ </S>",
    "<S> patterns , a planar wave front traveled across the array , where the spatial period was typically larger than the array dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> second , we observed a _ synchronized _ pattern ( b , 2nd row ) , in which the signals on all electrodes were synchronized at near - zero phase lag . complementing this state at the other extreme </S>",
    "<S> , we observed a _ random _ pattern ( b , 3rd row ) , which showed no apparent phase relation between electrodes . a fourth pattern , termed _ </S>",
    "<S> circular _ pattern ( b , 4th row ) , was characterized by an area near the array center around which the phases revolved . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we observed a _ </S>",
    "<S> radial _ pattern ( b , bottom row ) of radially inward or outward propagating waves , which was also characterized by a point of origin near the array center . </S>",
    "<S> a specific type of pattern persisted for only short time periods of approximately the duration of a single beta oscillation cycle . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , some phase maps could not be clearly attributed to one of these 5 phase patterns .    following this first empirical identification of classes of phase patterns </S>",
    "<S> , we aimed at automatically classifying the sequences of phase maps into one of these classes whenever possible . to this end , we introduced a set of 6 measures that capture features of the spatial arrangement of beta oscillations based on the phase map @xmath18 , and its spatial arrangement quantified by the phase gradients @xmath26 and the gradient coherence @xmath22 independently at each time point @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the details of how to construct these measures are given in the . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , each of the measures represents a feature of a given phase pattern that is characteristic for one or several of the 5 classes of phase patterns . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we give an intuitive explanation of the features relevant for each individual pattern class . </S>",
    "<S> the planar patterns , described by a planar wave front traveling across the entire array , were characterized by phase gradients that were aligned in parallel across the entire array . </S>",
    "<S> thus , such a pattern was composed of a wave front oriented perpendicularly to the gradients . </S>",
    "<S> the synchronized pattern was distinguished by a single phase value at all electrodes ( i.e. , the array appears in a single color in b ) and a random direction of phase gradients across the array . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the random pattern showed no apparent local spatial organization of phase gradients , but in contrast phases were uniformly distributed . in the circular pattern , like in the synchronized pattern , phase gradients in all directions were observed , but in contrast the distribution of phases across the array was also uniform such that the visualizations in b contained all colors . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , phase gradients were always arranged such that they pointed clockwise or counter - clockwise around the center of the array . and finally , the radial pattern exhibited phase gradients that , on a global view , pointed inward or outward from the array center . </S>",
    "<S> thus , gradients pointed in a direction orthogonal to that of circular patterns . </S>",
    "<S> common to both circular and radial patterns , all phase gradient directions were observed on the array and neighboring gradients on the array were similar .    based on the 6 measures , we used a thresholding procedure ( compare red dashed lines in in the supplemental information ) to assign each phase pattern at time point @xmath20 to one of the 5 classes of patterns , or , if none of the combined threshold criteria was met , the phase pattern was left unclassified . </S>",
    "<S> thresholds were set empirically in such a way that they led to a conservative association of phase patterns with pattern classes , i.e. , only clearly identified patterns were classified ( see in the supplemental information for a visualization of accepted and rejected classifications ) . </S>",
    "<S> details of the classification process are provided in the . </S>",
    "<S> our classification procedure had some experimental limitations such as the low spatial sampling of the 100 electrodes ( @xmath27 inter - electrode distance ) and the small spatial window of observation ( @xmath28 ) as compared to the spatial wavelengths exhibited by some patterns . </S>",
    "<S> this may affect , in particular , the radial and circular patterns in which the point of origin was not at the array center , making it impossible to infer the pattern unequivocally . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , observed patterns could also have represented transient dynamics from switching between patterns or even overlaps of competing patterns , which could not be properly distinguished . if for any of these reasons a pattern did not fulfill the strict criteria of one of the five pattern classes described above , we referred to it as _ unclassified_.    the use of our algorithm enabled us to quantitatively disambiguate the 5 phase patterns that appeared as salient features upon visual inspection of the phase maps . </S>",
    "<S> the phase patterns shown in b were determined by using this algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> a shows the lfp recorded on one electrode during one single trial , in which all classified phase patterns are marked , including those shown in panel b. the corresponding measures and thresholds used in the classification procedure are depicted in .    </S>",
    "<S> periods of clearly identified phase patterns were typically of short duration and occurred interspersed throughout the trial . during the entire length of all selected sessions , </S>",
    "<S> including both the behavioral trials and the inter - trial intervals , we counted for each monkey the number of occurrences of continuous periods of time where one of the 5 phase patterns or an unclassified pattern was observed . </S>",
