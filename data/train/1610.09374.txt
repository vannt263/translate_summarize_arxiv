    "all well - studied galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) exhibit star - to - star abundance variations with enhancement in n , na , and al , and depletion in c and o ( and occasionally depletion in mg ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the study of @xcite has revealed that typically @xmath1 of the cluster stars show light - element abundance variations that are not usually found in field stars , although recent work by @xcite showed that the fractions of cluster stars with chemical composition differing from halo stars are less uniform ( ranging from @xmath233% to @xmath292% ) than those from the sample of @xcite .",
    "understanding the origin of the light element abundance spreads among gcs is one of the great unsolved problems in the study of stellar populations , and its solution potentially encodes crucial information that would reveal how gcs form .",
    "two popular scenarios for the formation of multiple populations invoke multiple star formation episodes , where later generations form out of gas polluted by the ejecta of an earlier generation of stars .",
    "these scenarios typically adopt fast rotating massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or asymptotic giant branch stars ( agb ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the stellar candidates responsible for the chemical anomalies observed ubiquitously in gcs . in both of these scenarios ,",
    "the mass of stellar ejecta available to form later generations is insufficient to account for the large observed fractions of enriched stars . to overcome this issue",
    ", these scenarios either adopt a non - standard initial mass function for the different generations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or predict that gcs were 10 - 100 times more massive at birth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this last implication is however in conflict with observations of the number ratio of gc and field stars in nearby dwarf galaxies ( fornax , wlm , ikn ) , which suggest that gcs in these systems could not have been more than about five times more massive initially @xcite .",
    "in addition to the two sources of enriched material mentioned above , super - massive stars with @xmath3 have also been considered as polluters to explain the detailed abundance patterns observed in gcs @xcite .",
    "@xcite also proposed a scenario that does not invoke multiple generations of stars , and in which the enriched material is released by massive interacting binaries @xcite and accreted onto the circumstellar discs of low - mass pre - main sequence stars from the same stellar generation ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* which highlights important limitations regarding the efficiency of such an accretion process ) .",
    "for a more detailed review of the different formation scenarios for multiple populations developed so far , in particular with respect to their shortcomings in simultaneously reproducing the observed abundance patterns of na , o , and he in different gcs , we refer to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in short",
    ", none of the scenarios proposed so far provides a complete and satisfying explanation to the presence of multiple populations in gcs .    understanding the formation and evolution of gcs and their multiple populations requires theoretical and observational efforts . from the observational perspective",
    ", the presence of light - element abundance variations has been probed by using low- ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or high - resolution spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with photometry using narrow band filters covering molecular bands sensitive to the abundances of c , n , and o abundances ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the light - element abundance spreads show up as split or broad sequences in the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "additional insights have emerged by studying large samples of stars covering a wide spatial range in several gcs .",
    "for instance , @xcite found a difference in the radial distributions ( from about the half - light radius and beyond ) of the different populations identified using sloan @xmath4 photometry in a number of gcs ( m2 , m3 , m5 , m13 , m15 , m53 , and m92 ) . in their study , the presumably n - enriched stars were found to be more centrally concentrated .",
    "previous low - resolution spectroscopy studies have also found that the n - rich population is more centrally concentrated in the metal - rich gc 47 tuc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this finding was confirmed by @xcite using hst photometry and @xcite using high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "a spatial separation among the multiple populations in gcs could have been imprinted during the early stages of gc formation .",
    "for instance , in the scenario proposed by @xcite , a second generation forms in the central regions of a cluster .",
    "furthermore , @xcite studied the long - term dynamical evolution of a multiple generations scenario with initial spatial segregation .",
    "their @xmath5-body simulations indicate that the multiple populations do not fully mix spatially until a gc has lost @xmath6 of its initial mass due to two - body relaxation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this framework , the multiple populations of dynamically less evolved gcs , such as 47 tuc , are not completely mixed and still exhibit an imprint of their initial distributions , whereas gcs that have lost a large fraction of their mass would be fully mixed spatially ( e.g. ngc 6362 - @xcite , @xcite ; m71 - @xcite ) .",
    "it is however worth noting that the trend of a more centrally concentrated enriched population is maybe not universal . using hst / wfc3 photometry",
    ", @xcite found that the giants with normal composition are more centrally concentrated than the enriched giants in the inner parts of m15 ( i.e. within the half - light radius ) . a similar reversed trend with respect to what was found in previous studies",
    "was also reported by @xcite , who found the cn - weak stars to be more centrally concentrated compared to the cn - strong stars in the gcs ngc 362 and ngc 6723 , although their samples ( based on ground - based narrow - band photometry ) are incomplete in the central regions of the clusters .",
    "@xcite showed that to explain their observed radial distributions in m15 in terms of dynamical mass segregation , giants with normal composition would need to be @xmath7 more massive than their enriched counterparts .",
    "if this mass difference was due to a different initial helium composition for the different subpopulations , it would imply an extreme he enhancement for the enriched stars ( y  @xmath2  0.40 ) , which is not compatible with the modest he enhancement deduced from the colour - magnitude diagram of m15 ( see * ? ? ? * and discussions therein ) . whether the spatial distribution trend observed in the central regions of m15 then",
    "reflects initial conditions @xcite , or to what extent other factors - like a difference in the binary fraction of different chemical populations ( see the paragraph below ) or unaccounted observational systematic effects affecting the inferred radial distributions - could play a role however remains an open question ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". it will be interesting to compare future hst studies quantifying the spatial distribution of multiple populations in the inner parts of gcs with the behaviour reported in the above - mentioned studies .",
    "another piece of the puzzle comes from studies of binary star populations in gcs . using @xmath5-body simulations to explore a scenario in which a second generation formed more centrally concentrated",
    ", @xcite predicted a higher binary disruption rate for  second - generation \" ( na - enriched ) stars compared to  first - generation \" ( na - normal ;  field - like \" ) stars . the first attempt to distinguish differences between binary fractions among multiple populations",
    "was done by @xcite who found a lower binary fraction among na - enriched stars by searching for ba - enhanced giant stars in 15 gcs and radial velocity variations in ngc 6121 . in absence of multi - epoch radial velocity measurements , ba - enhanced stars allow to trace the incidence of binaries assuming the enrichment in ba comes from s - process polluted material transfered from a former agb binary companion .",
    "this assumption can be verified by modeling the s - process abundance pattern of ba - enriched stars with agb yields .",
    "for instance , @xcite confirmed from the analysis of many s - process elements that the abundance pattern of a na - normal s - process enhanced star in 47 tuc is consistent with enrichment by mass transfer from an 1.3 @xmath8 agb companion . clearly",
    ", s - process polluted stars that are / were part of a binary system can provide insights into multiple populations and binary evolution , but because these stars are extremely rare in gcs , their use for testing gc formation models is limited .",
    "a systematic and effective search for differences in binary fractions between na - normal and na - enriched stars was performed by @xcite on a sample of ten gcs .",
    "their radial velocity campaign suggested that binary stars are more abundant among the na - normal stars , which is consistent with the prediction by @xcite that the binaries of the na - enriched population would be more efficiently destroyed if they were born in a denser environment ( i.e. as part of a more centrally concentrated population ) .",
    "given the lower mass at a given age of helium - enriched stars , binaries with enriched stars would also be easier to unbind ( at the same encounter rate ) than binaries with more massive ",
    "helium - normal \" stars , but the effect is expected to be small @xcite .    besides chemical anomalies and intriguing spatial properties , the multiple populations of galactic gcs also display hints of kinematic differences in the outer regions of clusters ( around the half - light radius and beyond ) . in a pioneering study of 20 gcs",
    ", @xcite found a slightly lower line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the na - enhanced groups of three gcs ( ngc 6388 , ngc 6441 , ngc 2808 ) compared to stars with normal na abundance .",
    "furthermore , the na - normal groups of three gcs in the @xcite sample ( ngc 2808 , ngc 6171 , and ngc 7078 ) seem to exhibit larger rotational amplitudes by a few compared to na - enhanced stars , although the differences reported were based on small samples and the statistical significance of these differences was not reported .",
    "similarly , proper - motion and radial - velocity studies suggest that the enriched population of 47 tuc may have a lower velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "also in 47  tuc , @xcite found that the presumably he - enriched stars ( bluer main - sequence stars ) have a more radially anisotropic velocity distribution ( in the plane of the sky ) based on hst proper motions in a field located around 2 half - light radii from the centre of the cluster .",
    "a similar signature was reported by @xcite in ngc2808 , also based on hst proper motions , where stars between @xmath9 and 2 half - light radii and coinciding with the presumably he - enchanced populations show a more radially biased velocity distribution than the populations corresponding to normal non - enriched stars .    connecting the kinematic and chemical properties of multiple populations in gcs offers a new approach for understanding how they formed .",
    "in particular , in the outer regions of clusters , where the relaxation timescale is longer and mixing is less important , we may expect to see imprints of the initial conditions and formation process of multiple populations . the simulations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have studied the synergy between the kinematic , spatial / morphological , and chemical properties of the multiple populations in gcs . in particular",
    ", @xcite explored what type of kinematic signatures would survive the long - term dynamical evolution of old gcs and may allow to distinguish different formation scenarios . based on these results ,",
    "it is worth emphasising that the kinematic differences reported so far between multiple populations in some gcs are not unique signatures of a specific formation scenario .",
    "the observational evidence collected in the outer parts of clusters is generally consistent with an enriched population forming more centrally concentrated , which is predicted in all the scenarios proposed to date .",
    "if two - body relaxation has not completely erased spatial and kinematic differences between subpopulations , the population that is more centrally concentrated is indeed expected to be dynamically cooler ( i.e. lower velocity dispersion ) and to have developed a more radially biased velocity distribution as it diffuses outwards . as pointed out by @xcite , a difference in the rotational amplitude of subpopulations is a potential signature that would provide further insight and possibly unique constraints to distinguish between formation scenarios , because the initial orbital configuration of normal and enriched stars implied by different scenarios can lead to opposite predictions for the sign of the difference in rotational amplitude .    in the present work",
    ", we study the gc m13 ( ngc 6205 ) from a chemodynamical perspective and perform the first systematic search for kinematic differences between its multiple chemical populations .",

    "* ) and moderately metal - poor ( @xmath10fe / h@xmath11 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gc exhibits relatively strong rotation @xcite , has an na - enriched and o - depleted population that is more centrally concentrated @xcite , as well as three chemical subpopulations @xcite .",
    "the characteristics above , combined with the relatively large spectroscopic dataset of @xcite from which precise radial velocities and uncertainties can be extracted , along with the hint of a difference in the rotational amplitude of its multiple populations @xcite , makes it an ideal target to perform such a study and introduce a robust statistical method to investigate the kinematics of multiple populations .",

    "we define the position angle ( with respect to the centre of the cluster ) as increasing anti - clockwise in the plane of the sky from north ( @xmath17 ) towards east ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "if the rotational axis was aligned with the line of sight , rotation would be in the plane of the sky and we would obviously miss any rotational signature when using radial velocities . with solid - body rotation in the inner parts and a rotation curve peaking at intermediate radii ( around the half - mass radius ) followed by a decline , the functional form above conveniently captures the general behaviour seen in self - consistent equilibrium models of rotating stellar systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the kinematics is simply better constrained in regions of the cluster that are better sampled , and less well constrained in regions that are poorly sampled .",
    "note that we do not include a contamination term in our likelihood function since potential non - members have already been excluded from our dataset .    given that some metal - poor red giants within @xmath28  mag from the red giant branch tip are known to exhibit a velocity jitter at the level of @xmath29 @xcite",

    "this however only affects a fraction of our sample , and we performed additional experiments by running the same analysis but without including this velocity jitter term , which revealed that neglecting this effect would not affect our results and conclusions .",
    "the model parameters that we vary to find the best match to the data are @xmath31 .",
    "for those parameters , we adopt uninformative uniform priors over the following ranges : @xmath32 .",

    "we typically consider 500 walkers , and for each of these 800 steps in parameter space .",
    "convergence is generally obtained within a few hundred steps or less , and we consider a burn - in phase of 600 steps for all our fits to be on the safe side .",
    "we also checked that our results are robust against changes to the initial positions of the walkers .",
    "the method described above presents clear advantages over the traditional method used for detecting / characterising rotation in gcs @xcite .",
    "the latter consists of dividing the line - of - sight velocity dataset in two halves by a line passing through the centre with a given position angle , and computing the mean line - of - sight velocity for each subsample .",
    "the position angle of the dividing line is varied and the difference between the mean velocities is plotted against position angle , and then the pattern is fitted with a sine function . the position angle for which the difference in mean velocities is maximised gives an estimate of the position angle of the rotation axis , and the amplitude of the sine curve gives an indication of the mean rotational amplitude .",
    "it is however difficult to obtain reliable uncertainties from that method , because the data points shaping this sine pattern are all correlated ( the mean velocity difference for each data point is computed from the radial velocities of the whole sample ) . our discrete method deals in a straightforward and reliable way with the uncertainties on all fitting parameters , it avoids loss of information from binning the data , and it has the advantage of treating the velocity dispersion and rotational components simultaneously when comparing kinematic models to the data .      table [ bestfit ] lists , for the different subsamples considered and for the six free parameters of our analysis , the median value from the posterior probability distribution function ( marginalised over all other parameters ) , with error bars indicating the interval enclosing the central 68% of the probability distribution .",
    "we also show in figures [ post_all ] , [ post_intermediate ] , [ post_extreme ] , [ post_primordial ] , and [ post_intprim ] of appendix [ appendixa ] the two - dimensional projections of the posterior probability distribution on the planes determined by every pair of parameters .",
    "these figures also show histograms of the marginalised posterior probability distribution for each parameter of the kinematic model .",
    "figures [ sigma_profiles_p2_p3 ] and [ sigma_profiles_p1_p2 ] show a comparison of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles of different subsamples ( p1+p2+p3 , p1 , p2 , p3 ) .",
    "the binned dispersion profiles are obtained by assuming an equal number of stars in each bin ( apart from the outermost bin in which any additional leftover stars are also included ) and using the maximum likelihood estimator of @xcite to compute the dispersion in each bin and its uncertainty . for the radius of each bin",

    "best - fit dispersion profiles inferred from our fitting procedure are shown in the bottom panels of figures [ sigma_profiles_p2_p3 ] and [ sigma_profiles_p1_p2 ] , with shaded regions showing 1-@xmath41 envelopes . to obtain these 1-@xmath41 envelopes , we first sampled 1000 sets of parameters from the post burn - in phase of a given mcmc chain .",
    "from those , we then compute the associated line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile . then , at a given radius , we find the 16% and 84% percentiles of the dispersion of all 1000 dispersion profiles , and repeat for different radii .",
    "the solid lines representing the best - fit profiles represent the median of all the computed profiles at a each radius .",
    "similarly , figures [ rot_curves_p2_p3 ] and [ rot_curves_p1_p2 ] show a comparison of the rotation curves ( mean line - of - sight velocity as a function of projected distance from the rotation axis ) of different subsamples ( p1+p2+p3 , p1 , p2 , p3 ) .",
    "the binned rotation curves were obtained by adopting the best - fit position angle for the rotation axis ( table  [ bestfit ] ) , assuming an equal number of stars in each bin ( apart from the outermost bins ) and using the maximum likelihood estimator of @xcite to compute the mean line - of - sight velocity in each bin and its uncertainty . again ,",
    "note that the fits were performed on the discrete radial velocity measurements ( taking into account uncertainties in the position angle of the rotation axis ) , not on the binned rotation curves .",
    "the 1-@xmath41 envelopes on the best - fit rotation curves shown in the bottom panels of figures [ rot_curves_p2_p3 ] and [ rot_curves_p1_p2 ] were obtained in an analogous way as described above for the dispersion profiles .",
    "we first note from table [ bestfit ] that the mean velocity ( @xmath27 ) of all the chemical subpopulations considered is consistent ( within 1@xmath41 ) with the mean velocity of the cluster as a whole .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the different chemical subsamples are also consistent with each other within 1@xmath41 , with only a slight hint of a larger dispersion for population p1 compared to population p2 , and a larger dispersion for population p2 compared to population p3 , a trend that is in keeping with the more centrally concentrated distribution of population p3 reported by @xcite ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the observed dispersion profiles decrease with increasing radius within the range of our data .",
    "a clear rotation signature is found for the cluster as a whole , with an amplitude @xmath42  .",
    "we emphasise again that the rotational amplitudes reported here are lower limits to the three - dimensional rotational amplitudes because our data is only sensitive to the line - of - sight component of rotation , and the inclination of the rotation axis with respect to the line of sight is unknown for m13 .",
    "rotation is also obvious in population p3 ( @xmath43  ) , while a much weaker rotational signal is found for the dominant population p2 ( @xmath44  but consistent with no rotation within 2@xmath41 ) , suggesting that population p3 is driving the rotation signature found in the full sample .",
    "unsurprisingly , with a small number of stars in the p1 subsample , the kinematics of the ",

    "interestingly , the inferred position of the rotation axis of the different populations considered is in agreement within 1@xmath41 uncertainties , as can be seen from figure  [ vel_map ] and table  [ bestfit ] .",
    "the biggest kinematic differences are found when comparing the rotation curves of the p2 and p3 subsamples ( figure  [ rot_curves_p2_p3 ] ) , with very similar results obtained when comparing p3 with the rest of the cluster stars ( p1+p2 ) . with the kinematics of population",

    "this distribution peaks at @xmath0  and is clearly skewed towards p3 having a larger rotational amplitude than p2 , with a 98.4% probability that the rotation amplitude of p3 is larger .    to further illustrate the observed kinematic differences between p2 , p3 , and the cluster as a whole , we show in figure  [ vrot_sigma ] the radial profile of @xmath47 for these samples averaged along specific line of sights ( with inclination angles of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 between the rotation axis and the line of sight ) in order to give an idea of the degeneracy between inclination angle and intrinsic rotation .",
    "note that the inclination angle of the rotation axis of m13 is not constrained observationally , but @xmath49 was adopted as a rough estimate providing a satisfying agreement between observations and self - consistent rotating models by @xcite . to build the @xmath47 profiles as a function of projected distance @xmath51 from the centre of the cluster",
    ", we average the absolute value of @xmath22 over all angles in the meridional plane ( i.e. x - y plane in fig .",

    "another effect could potentially introduce a spurious rotational signal , but it is expected to be most important in objects with a larger angular extent on the sky such as dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the milky way . in these extended objects , the mean line - of - sight velocity of a star will depend on the position of the star because of geometrical projection effects due to the proper motion of the object , introducing a velocity gradient mimicking solid - body rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "note again that the rotation curve of m13 appears to peak at intermediate radii and is not solid - body all the way to the outer parts of the cluster as would be expected if this geometrical effect was important .",

    "this idea is further supported by the rotating distribution - function based models of m13 by @xcite , which show reasonable agreement with the observed variation of the axial ratio of isophotes as a function of the semi - major axis ( based on the data by * ? ? ?",

    "we note that this approach is no substitute to detailed dynamical modelling , because it only compares global quantities while rotation and ellipticity can vary significantly with radius as the anisotropy parameter changes , and the position of a cluster in the @xmath80 vs. @xmath81 diagram is also sensitive to inclination effects ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the position of a cluster in the diagram is often compared to the relation between @xmath80 and @xmath81 expected for oblate rotators viewed  edge - on \" @xcite .",

    "this evidence and the remaining discrepancies discussed above ( e.g. mismatches between the position of the semi - major axis from different studies ) call for a more detailed study modelling the interplay of rotation , pressure anisotropy , galactic tides and flattening in this cluster , which will be helped by the precise radial velocities reported here and future proper motions from the gaia satellite .",
    "this is however beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "another useful diagnostic is the ratio of rotational amplitude to velocity dispersion as a function of radius ( figure  [ vrot_sigma ] ) .",

    "such a profile has been observed in other clusters like @xmath46  cen and 47 tuc @xcite , and is qualitatively consistent with what we observe in m13 profile with those of @xcite and @xcite , note that our @xmath84 values may be underestimated because of the way we define @xmath22 compared to these authors .",
    "our understanding is that they represent @xmath22 as the azimuthal velocity evaluated on the equatorial plane , while we average the rotational velocity over all angles in the meridional plane . with our assumed cylindrical rotation ,",
    "this yields lower values of @xmath22 at a given radius than if we reported the rotational velocity on the equatorial plane . ] .",

    "* ) , and it could have been much more important initially because rotation is progressively wiped out as clusters evolve dynamically .",
    "rotation is a natural consequence of the cluster formation process from the collapse of a star - forming cloud with net angular momentum , and differential rotation would naturally arise in star clusters that form by undergoing the process of violent relaxation in the tidal field of their host galaxy @xcite .",

    "but before we can establish that the observed difference in rotational amplitude between the multiple populations of m13 stems for the formation and early evolution of the cluster , we first need to consider whether this signature could simply be a product of dynamical evolution .",
    "this could happen if the distinct chemical populations also have different mean stellar masses .",
    "one way to achieve this is through differences in their initial he fraction . using far - ultraviolet and optical cmds from hst",

    "the dynamical evolution of rotating clusters with two mass components or a mass spectrum has been studied with fokker - planck models @xcite , direct @xmath5-body simulations @xcite , or both @xcite . from these studies , the main dynamical evolution process that would lead to a difference in rotational amplitude between different mass species actually causes the most massive stars in the central parts to rotate faster than lower mass stars .",
    "two main factors are instrumental in determining the evolutionary behaviour of the rotational properties of the models : the transport of angular momentum within the radial extension of the system , as driven by collisional relaxation ( which obviously takes place also in equal - mass systems ) and the exchange of angular momentum between different mass species , in association with the tendency towards energy equipartition .",
    "the second factor is intrinsically linked to the process of mass segregation , i.e. the fact that more massive stars tend to become progressively more radially concentrated , as a result of their relaxation - driven evolution . in the presence of global internal rotation ,",
    "the interplay between mass segregation and transport of angular momentum is highly non - trivial , but the investigations quoted above have already offered some evidence that heavier component becomes more centrally concentrated and are characterised by a higher angular velocity , compared to the lower mass component , which is spatially more diffuse and slower rotating .",
    "the two components then experience a rather different evolution , with the angular velocity of the heavier component increasing very rapidly during the early phases , while that of the lighter stars shows only a moderate increment ( see fig .",
    "6 from * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , these results seem to have a significant dependence on the initial rotation strength of the systems ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , and it should be stressed that , in this context , the different mass components start with the same value of angular velocity .    from the mass differences estimated above for the extremely o - depleted ( he - rich ) giants compared to he - normal giants , the expected effect of dynamical evolution outlined above for multi - mass rotating systems",
    "is thus opposite to the difference in rotational amplitude that we detected in m13 ( where the presumably less massive stars are rotating more rapidly ) .",
    "moreover , differences in the peak rotational velocity of different mass species remain relatively small in the models of @xcite and @xcite , despite much larger mass ratios between the different components , while we find that the peak rotational velocity of the extreme population is much larger ( a factor @xmath0 ) than the peak rotational velocity of the other subpopulations .",
    "we thus argue that the faster rotation inferred for the extreme population ( p3 ) in m13 is not , as far as we can tell , an effect produced by the long - term dynamical evolution of the cluster . in a different context than multiple populations or mass species",
    ", @xcite mentioned another effect which could give rise to strong rotation for stars in the central regions of a cluster : collisions between stars or binaries could produce such a result since the collisions dissipate the relative kinetic energy of the colliding particles but conserve their net angular momentum in the cluster potential .",
    "if somehow the extreme o depletion and na enrichment of population p3 can be linked to the formation of these stars via stellar mergers in the central regions of the cluster , in particular during its early evolution when the cluster was much denser , then this would potentially explain the more centrally concentrated distribution of this population and its faster rotation .",
    "in such a scenario , we would expect the rotation axis of this extreme population to align with the rotation axis of the bulk of the cluster stars , which is consistent with what we observe in m13 .    through conservation of angular momentum",
    ", a faster rotation and more centrally concentrated distribution is also expected for a stellar population that would form from dissipative accretion of enriched gas onto the central regions of the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "plus , it would not address the question of how the rest of the na - enriched stars ( with less extreme o depletion ) got polluted . in this scenario",
    ", we would also expect the rotation axis to be the same for different subpopulations .    the opposite difference in rotation trend",
    "is expected from a scenario in which the most enriched stars are the ones initially crossing the core of the cluster and preferentially on radial ( low angular momentum ) orbits ( e.g. the early disc accretion scenario of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the rotational amplitude of the enriched stars at a given radius would be lower initially ( assuming the cluster has some net rotation ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is contradicted by our observations of the faster rotation of population p3 in m13 .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ intro ] , this scenario is already disfavoured for other reasons .",
    "we used radial velocities from spectra obtained with the wiyn telescope to probe the presence of kinematical differences among m13 multiple populations .",

    "we fitted a six - parameter kinematic model including rotation to the full dataset and various chemical subsamples .",
    "in addition to improved constraints on the global rotation and importance of rotational support in m13 , we found a significant difference in the rotational amplitude of different subpopulations .",
    "the most likely difference between the rotational amplitude of the extremely o - depleted population and the rest of the sample was found to be @xmath0  ( with the extreme population rotating faster ) , with 98.4% probability that the rotational amplitude of this extreme population is larger than the rotational amplitude of the rest of the sample .",
    "we also find that the inferred position angle of the rotation axis for the different subpopulations considered is consistent , within uncertainties , with the hypothesis that all subpopulations share the same rotation axis , although it must be said that the rotation axis of the ",
    "normal \" halo - like subpopulation is poorly constrained .",
    "we suggested that the origin of such a kinematical signature in m13 is likely a signature imprinted early in the formation history of this non - fully mixed gc .",
    "this would open up the possibility to use kinematics to distinguish between different scenarios for the formation of multiple populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". we also argued , based on previous modelling that explored the evolution of multi - mass rotating systems , that this signature is unlikely to result from the long - term dynamical evolution of the cluster and be caused by mean stellar mass differences between the subpopulations .",
    "given the modest size of our sample , it will be desirable to follow up on these findings and hopefully improve the statistical significance of the reported difference in the rotation signals of subpopulations .",
    "building a larger sample ( in particular increasing the sample of o - depleted stars , which exhibit the stronger rotational amplitude in our dataset ) would benefit from a different observational strategy , since chemical tagging using high - resolution spectroscopy is observationally expensive .",
    "an effective alternative method for tracing light - element abundance variations in gcs is based on photometry with narrow - band filters sensitive to c , n , and o abundances .",
    "this is the approach adopted by the hubble space telescope uv legacy survey of galactic gcs @xcite , from which eventual catalogues of chemically tagged stars ( which will include m13 ) , complemented by gaia proper motions and/or ground - based radial velocities , will facilitate a robust statistical exploration of the kinematical properties of galactic gcs and their multiple populations .",
    "whether different degrees of rotation between chemical subpopulations in gcs is the norm or the exception remains to be studied on large samples of stars in more clusters .",
    "similarly , whether the most o - depleted and na - enriched stars systematically rotate faster than other subpopulations should be checked .",

    "<S> we use radial velocities from spectra of giants obtained with the wiyn telescope , coupled with existing chemical abundance measurements of na and o for the same stars , to probe the presence of kinematic differences among the multiple populations of the globular cluster ( gc ) m13 . to characterise the kinematics of various chemical subsamples , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a method using bayesian inference along with an mcmc algorithm to fit a six - parameter kinematic model ( including rotation ) to these subsamples . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the so - called  extreme \" population ( na - enhanced and extremely o - depleted ) exhibits faster rotation around the centre of the cluster than the other cluster stars , in particular when compared to the dominant  intermediate \" population ( moderately na - enhanced and o - depleted ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely difference between the rotational amplitude of this extreme population and that of the intermediate population is found to be @xmath0  , with a 98.4% probability that the rotational amplitude of the extreme population is larger than that of the intermediate population . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the observed difference in rotational amplitudes , obtained when splitting subsamples according to their chemistry , is not a product of the long - term dynamical evolution of the cluster , but more likely a surviving feature imprinted early in the formation history of this gc and its multiple populations . </S>",
    "<S> we also find an agreement ( within uncertainties ) in the inferred position angle of the rotation axis of the different subpopulations considered . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the constraints that these results may place on various formation scenarios .    </S>",
