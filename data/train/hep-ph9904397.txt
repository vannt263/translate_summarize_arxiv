    "recent interest in r - parity violating ( rpv ) susy decay modes is motivated by the possible high-@xmath3 event excess at hera  @xcite .",
    "when interpretation of the excess through first - generation leptoquarks was excluded by the d  @xcite and cdf  @xcite experiments , it was suggested  @xcite that such an effect could be explained via the @xmath4-channel production of a charm or top squark decaying into the @xmath5 final state .",
    "both the production and the decay vertices would thereby violate r - parity . although more recent data has not confirmed the previous event excess , and despite the combined analysis showed that the anomalous events reported by the h1 and zeus experiments were unlikely to originate from the production of a single @xmath4-channel narrow resonance  @xcite , interest in rpv signatures has not abatted .",
    "the cdf and d  collaborations have recently performed searches for rpv susy  @xcite , and have set new mass limits on the rpv susy particles .",
    "both experiments focussed their searches on the @xmath6 couplings , as motivated by the high-@xmath3 hera event excess .",
    "the results of the d  searches are extended to the run  2 case and the expected sensitivity to the rpv couplings is discussed .",
    "the d  search for rpv susy considered the case of neutralino lsp which decays into a lepton and two quarks due to a finite rpv @xmath6 coupling ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rpv - decay ] ) .",
    "both the electron and muon decay channels were considered , corresponding to what commonly referred to as @xmath7 and @xmath8 couplings , respectively .",
    "the corresponding final states contain either @xmath9 or @xmath10 and at least four accompanying jets . unlike at hera , this search is not sensitive to the value of the rpv coupling , as long as it is large enough so that the neutralino decays within the d  detector .",
    "that corresponds to @xmath11 , which gives a lot of room , given current indirect constraints  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the neutralino ( lsp ) pairs are produced in cascade decays of other supersymmetric particles and use all susy pair production mechanisms when generating signal events .",
    "signal events were generated within the sugra framework with the following values of susy parameters : @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( the results are not sensitive to the value of @xmath15 . ) center of mass energy of the colliding beams was taken to be 2 tev .",
    "isajet  @xcite was used for event generation .",
    "the acceptance and resolution of the d  detector were parametrized using the following resolutions : @xmath16}$ ] ( electrons ) , @xmath17 ( muons ) , and @xmath18}$ ] ( jets ) and found consistent with the full detector simulation based on geant  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : rpv - points ] shows the points in the @xmath19 sugra parameter space where signal monte carlo events were generated for the electron channel .",
    "similar points were studied for the muon - decay channel .",
    "a multijet trigger was used for the analysis of run  1 data .",
    "it was found to be nearly 100% efficient for the typical rpv signal .",
    "since run  2 trigger list will include a similar trigger , we assume trigger efficiency of 100% and do not perform any trigger simulations for the run  2 .",
    "the following offline selections were used :    * at least two good electrons , the leading one with @xmath20 gev and the other one with @xmath21 gev ; * rapidity range @xmath22 ( central calorimeter ) , or @xmath23 ( end calorimeters ) for all the electrons ; * energy isolation for the electrons : the em energy in the r=0.2 cone about the center of gravity of the em cluster , subtracted from the total energy in r=0.4 cone , should not exceed 15% of the em energy in the r-0.2 cone .",
    "* at least four jets with @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 ; * the dielectron invariant mass ( @xmath26 ) should not be in the z - mass interval , ie , @xmath27 gev/@xmath28 .    in the present analysis we have dropped the requirement on @xmath29 , but retained all other offline criteria that were used in the previous analysis of data from run  i  @xcite .",
    "the following event selection requirements were used for the muon decay channel :    * two muons , the leading one with @xmath30 15 gev , and the other one with @xmath30 10 gev . *",
    "rapidity range @xmath31 for both muons .",
    "* energy isolation requirement for both muons , i.e. the calorimeter energy accompanying the muon in a ( @xmath32 @xmath33 ) cone of 0.4 should be consistent with that from a minimum ionising particle . * at least four jets with @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 ;",
    "the number of signal events expected can be written as : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the expected number of events for luminosity @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the cross - section , and @xmath40 is the overall efficiency .",
    "the efficiency @xmath40 can be split into three terms : @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 is the trigger efficiency for the events that pass the offline cuts ( assumed to be 100% ) , @xmath43 is the efficiency for offline criteria , which includes kinematic , fiducial and topological requirements , and @xmath44 is the electron / jet identification efficiency .",
    "the efficiency for identifying jets is very high ( @xmath45 ) and is expected to stay the same in run 2 .",
    "electron identification efficiencies in run 1 were @xmath46 in the central ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 in the forward ( @xmath49 ) regions  @xcite .",
    "these efficiencies were calculated for electrons with @xmath50  gev , it drops by about 30% for electrons with @xmath51  gev .",
    "the muon identification efficiencies used in run 1 were @xmath52 in the central ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 in the forward ( @xmath55 ) regions  @xcite .",
    "these were calculated for muons with @xmath56  gev . for muons with @xmath57",
    "gev the efficiencies were 80% smaller on average  @xcite .    in the present analysis we have taken the overall particle identification efficiency to be @xmath58 in each channel , independent of lepton @xmath59 , primarily due to the expectation of a better tracker and muon spectrometer for the upgraded d  experiment .",
    "the main backgrounds are expected to arise from drell - yan production in association with four or more jets , dilepton top - quark events , and qcd multijet events .",
    "the latter is the dominant background for the electron channel ( followed by the drell - yan background ) . in the case of muons ,",
    "the background is dominated by the drell - yan and top pair production .",
    "we used monte carlo to calculate background from the first two sources , and data to estimate background from qcd jets .",
    "background for the run 1 analysis was estimated to be @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 from qcd and @xmath62 from the other processes ) for @xmath63 of data . to extrapolate this number to the data set from run 2 , we have simply multiplied it by the ratio of luminosities to obtain @xmath64 events .",
    "however , it is expected that due to the central magnetic field in the upgraded d  detector , the probability of jets to be misidentified as electrons will be reduced by a factor of @xmath65 in run 2 .",
    "we have therefore considered a second scenario with the smaller expected background of @xmath66 events .    for the muon channel",
    ", the expected background has been scaled directly from the run 1 analysis .",
    "we expect @xmath67 background events in run 2 .",
    "in order to obtain the sensitivity of run 2 in to rpv decays , we calculated the efficiency for signal for all the mass points shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpv - points ] .",
    "typical efficiencies , the signal cross section in the @xmath68  jets channel , and the expected event yield in 2  @xmath69 of data , for several representative @xmath19 points , are given in table  [ table : rpv - eff ] .",
    "similar numbers are obtained for the muon channel .",
    "we use these efficiencies to obtain exclusion limits in the @xmath19 plane at 95% cl , assuming that no excess of events will be observed above the predicted background .",
    "the exclusion contours for the electron and muon channel are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpv - e ] and [ fig : rpv - mu ] , respectively .",
    "numerical values of the limits are summarized in table  [ table : rpv - limits ] .",
    "on @xmath71 & limit when @xmath72 +   & ( for any @xmath71 ) & ( for any @xmath73 ) & +   + run 1 & 252 gev & 232 gev & 283 gev + run 2 ( scenario i ) & 430 gev & 490 gev & 490 gev + run 2 ( scenario ii ) & 520 gev & 575 gev & 585 gev +   + run 2 & 560 gev & 640 gev & 665 gev +      it s worth mentioning that our analysis provides a conservative estimate of the sensitivity achievable in run  2 , since no formal optimization of the signal vs. background has been performed .",
    "we expect that a formal optimization can improve the sensitivity in the mass reach by 1520% .    10 h1 collaboration , c.  adloff , z. phys .",
