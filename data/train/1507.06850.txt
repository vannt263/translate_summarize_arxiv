    "since markowitz @xcite published his seminal work on the mean - variance portfolio selection sixty years ago , the mean - risk portfolio selection framework has become one of the most prominent topics in quantitative finance .",
    "recently , there has been increasing interest in studying the dynamic mean - variance portfolio problem with various constraints , as well as addressing their financial applications .",
    "typical contributions include bielecki , jin , pliska and zhou @xcite , cui , gao , li and li @xcite , cui , li and li @xcite , czichowsky and schweizer @xcite , heunis @xcite , hu and zhou @xcite , duffie and richardson @xcite , labb and heunis @xcite , li and ng @xcite , zhou and li @xcite , and li , zhou and lim @xcite .",
    "the dynamic mean - variance problem can be treated in a forward - looking way by starting with the initial state . in some financial engineering problems",
    ", however , one needs to study stochastic systems with constrained conditions , such as cone - constrained policies .",
    "this naturally results in a continuous - time mean - variance portfolio selection problem with _",
    "constraints for the wealth process _ , ( see @xcite ) , and _",
    "constraints for the policies _ , ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , for a given expected terminal target . to the best of our knowledge , despite active research efforts in this direction in recent years , there has been little progress in the continuous - time mean - variance problem with the _ mixed _ restriction of both bankruptcy prohibition and convex cone portfolio constraints .",
    "this paper aims to address this long - standing and notoriously difficult problem , not only for its theoretical significance , but also for its practical importance .",
    "new ideas , significantly different from those developed in the existing literature , establish a general theory for stochastic control problems with mixed constraints for state and control variables .",
    "li , zhou and lim @xcite considered a continuous - time mean - variance problem with no - shorting constraints , while cui , gao , li and li @xcite developed its counterpart in discrete - time .",
    "bielecki , jin , pliska and zhou @xcite paved the way for investigating continuous - time mean - variance with bankruptcy prohibition using a martingale approach .",
    "sun and wang @xcite introduced a market consisting of a riskless asset and one risky portfolio under constraints such as market incompleteness , no - shorting , or partial information .",
    "labb and heunis @xcite employed a duality method to analyze both the mean - variance portfolio selection and mean - variance hedging problems with general convex constraints .",
    "in particular , czichowsky and schweizer @xcite further studied cone - constrained continuous - time mean - variance portfolio selection problem with the price processes being semimartingales .",
    "cui , gao , li and li @xcite and cui , li and li @xcite derived explicit optimal semi - analytical mean - variance policies for discrete - time markets under no - shorting and convex cone constraints , respectively . also , fllmer and schied @xcite and pham and touzi @xcite showed that in a constrained market , no arbitrage opportunity is equivalent to the existence of a supermartingale measure , under which the discounted wealth process of any admissible policy is a supermartingale , ( see carassus , pham and touzi @xcite for a situation with upper bounds on proportion positions ) . in particular , xu and shreve in their two - part papers @xcite investigated a utility maximization problem with no - shorting constraints using duality analysis . recently , heunis @xcite carefully considered to minimize the expected value of a general quadratic loss function of the wealth in a more general setting where there is a specified convex constraint on the portfolio over the trading interval , together with a specified almost - sure lower - bound on the wealth at close of trade .    the existing theory and methods can not directly handle the continuous - time mean - variance problem with the mixed restriction of both bankruptcy prohibition and convex cone portfolio constraints .",
    "therefore , we introduce a hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation to analyze this problem .",
    "based on our analysis , we find out that the market price of risk in policy is actually independent of the wealth process .",
    "this important finding allows us to overcome the difficulty of the original problem and also makes the similar continuous - time financial investment problem both interesting and practical .",
    "hence , we can construct a transformation to tackle the model presented above using linear - quadratic convex optimization technique .",
    "finally , we discuss the equivalent problem using the model of bielecki , jin , pliska and zhou @xcite without the viscosity solution technique developed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we formulate the continuous - time mean - variance problem with the mixed restriction of a bankruptcy prohibition and convex cone portfolio constraints . in section 3",
    ", we transform our mean - variance problem into an equivalent mean - variance problem with a bankruptcy prohibition _ without _ convex cone portfolio constraints .",
    "we derive the pre - committed continuous - time efficient mean - variance policy for our problem using the model proposed by bielecki , jin , pliska and zhou @xcite in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we discuss properties of the continuous - time mean - variance problems with different constraints . in section 6 , we present a numerical simulation to illustrate results established in this paper .",
