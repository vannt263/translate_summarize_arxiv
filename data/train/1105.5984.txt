    "a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) is a large burst of coronal magnetic fields and plasma with a typical mass of 10@xmath0 g and speeds of 250 - 1000 km s@xmath1 into interplanetary space @xcite .",
    "cmes are often associated with solar flares and prominence eruptions .",
    "the occurrence of cmes depends on the phase of the solar cycle .",
    "the ejected cmes that move toward earth drive interplanetary shocks and trigger geomagnetic storms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such geomagnetic storms pose significant hazards to space operations .",
    "enhancements of trapped particles of the radiation belts increase spacecraft charging and solar energetic protons cause single event upset @xcite .",
    "atmospheric heating by the charged particles and solar ultraviolet / x - ray emission causes the earth s upper atmosphere to expand , and leads to satellite drag @xcite .    for general users of x - ray astronomy satellites , signals associated with cmes and geomagnetic storms may constitute additional sources of background when they observe astrophysical objects .",
    "increased scattering of solar x - rays by the earth s atmosphere is often seen in satellite data . this scattering is due to thomson scattering of solar x - rays by electrons in the sunlit atmosphere and absorption of incident solar x - rays followed by the emission of characteristic k lines @xcite .",
    "removal of time durations when the line of sight direction is near the sunlit atmosphere is effective in removing this emission .",
    "another major background is solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) .",
    "this occurs when an ion in the solar wind interacts with a neutral atom .",
    "the ion strips an electron(s ) from the atom , and then x - ray or ultraviolet photon(s ) are released as the electron relaxes into the ground state .",
    "short - term variations from swcx in earth s exosphere @xcite or longer - term variations from swcx in interplanetary space @xcite and heliosphere @xcite , can produce diffuse x - ray emission below @xmath2 kev . to characterize the swcx emission in an astrophysical data set , careful checks of an x - ray light curve and simultaneously observed solar wind data are indispensable .    the terrestrial diffuse x - ray emission , i.e. , scattering of solar x - rays and exospheric swcx , provides valuable information concerning the atmospheric expansion , the exospheric density , the constituents of the solar wind , and the transport processes of the plasma within the bow shock .",
    "@xcite systematically searched for the exospheric swcx emission from data in the xmm - newton archive .",
    "approximately 3.4 % of observations were affected by the exospheric swcx @xcite .",
    "most of the swcx emission were seen when xmm - newton observes through the sub - solar side of the magnetosheath . in some cases",
    ", the swcx emission was seen when the line of sight direction did not intersect the high flux region .",
    "they reasoned that these cases probably originate from cmes .",
    "they studied the most spectrally rich example of swcx and argued that this event was associated with a cme recorded on 2001 october 21 @xcite .    thanks to a good energy response and the low instrument background of the x - ray ccds ( x - ray imaging spectrometer , xis : @xcite ) , the fifth japanese x - ray",
    "astronomical satellite suzaku @xcite is ideal for studying the terrestrial diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite discovered an exospheric swcx event in the direction of the north ecliptic pole .",
    "their data indicated that a distance to the point where the geomagnetic field becomes open to space for the first time in the line of sight may be closely related to the short term swcx variability . @xcite found another exospheric swcx event toward the sub - solar side of the magnetosheath .",
    "they conducted a cross correlation analysis using the suzaku o x - ray light curve and the ace solar wind o@xmath3 curve , and found a significant correlation between them .",
    "the necessary column density of neutral hydrogen atoms in the earth s exosphere to explain the observed x - ray flux exceeded that predicted by the exosphere model by a factor of 10 .",
    "they reasoned that the discrepancy can be due to uncertainty of the model itself and/or solar wind distribution in the magnetosphere .    in this paper ,",
    "we present evidence of a strong enhancement of the terrestrial diffuse x - ray emission associated with a strong geomagnetic storm recorded on 2005 august 24 .",
    "the event under analysis occurred during the solar declining phase of solar cycle 23 .",
    "we utilized the dst index as an indicator of the geomagnetic storm .",
    "this is an index for the world wide magnetic storm level and constructed by averaging the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field from mid - latitude and equatorial magnetometer data .",
    "negative dst values caused by the storm time ring current indicate a magnetic storm is in progress .",
    "the dst index is provided by the world data center for geomagnetism , kyoto , japan .",
    "the storm studied in this paper is strongest with the dst index of @xmath4 nt that suzaku has experienced as of 2011 april .",
    "the suzaku observation on 2005 august 23 - 24 was toward the psr b1509@xmath558 ( ra @xmath6 228.484 deg , dec @xmath6 @xmath559.136 deg , @xmath7 deg , @xmath8 deg ) .",
    "the suzaku observation i d is 100009010 .",
    "this field contains a bright x - ray pulsar , a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , and the hot nebula rcw 89 .",

    "the average line of sight vector in the gse and gsm coordinates are ( @xmath50.0395 , 0.7717 , @xmath50.6343 ) and ( @xmath50.0395 , 0.5811 , @xmath50.8124 ) , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : los ] , we plot the line of sight during the observation .",
    "it is toward the south direction , while the past two suzaku detections of exospheric swcx events were toward the north ecliptic pole and magnetosheath .",
    "the observation starts from 2005 august 23 ( the day of year , doy , of 235 in 2005 ) 08:38 and ends august 24 ( doy of 236 ) 20:38 .",
    "the original aim of the observation was timing calibration using the pulsation period of the pulsar that has been published by @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , in a part of the observation , the xis was operated at timing mode , in addition to normal clocking mode . because the imaging capability is not available in the timing mode , we analyzed only the normal clocking mode data .",
    "the effective exposure time of the normal clocking mode data after standard data screening is 59 ks .",
    "the process version is 2.0.6.13 .",
    "the heasoft analysis package ( version 6.4 ) was used to extract images , light curves , spectral products and instrumental response files .",
    "we created xis images in three representative energy bands from bi ( back - illuminated , xis1 ) and fi ( front - illuminated , xis0 , 2 , and 3 ) cameras as shown in figure [ fig : img ] .",
    "two diffuse x - ray emission at the positions of the pulsar and pwn , and rcw 89 are observed .",
    "the pulsar and pwn emissions located in the south east becomes dominant in the hard x - ray band , while the north nebula rcw 89 is brighter in the soft band .",
    "past higher resolution chandra images showed similar tendencies ( figure 6 in @xcite ) . from these past observations ,",
    "the pulsar and pwn are known to have a hard power law spectrum , while the spectrum of rcw 89 is dominated by a thermal plasma emission . to minimize contamination from these x - ray sources",
    ", we chose three corner regions for the following light curve and spectral analyses .",
    "hereafter we call a sum of the three regions a terrestrial diffuse x - ray emission ( tdx ) region",
    ". a total area of the tdx region is 41.9 arcmin@xmath11 .",
    "in figure [ fig : cur1 ] , we plot x - ray light curves extracted from the tdx region in two energy bands that could potentially contain oxygen emission lines from scattering of solar x - rays and/or swcx ( 0.50.7 kev ) and for comparison a non - swcx continuum at high energies ( 2.55 kev ) , similar to @xcite . the 0.50.7 kev count rate shows a clear enhancement from doy of 236.3 to 236.8 .",
    "the average rate in the first half of the observation ( pre - storm period in figure [ fig : cur1 ] ) and the second half covering ( storm period ) are 0.0057@xmath120.0008 and 0.013@xmath120.001 cts sec@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "errors are 2@xmath13 significance . in contrast , the 2.55 kev count rate shows less variability with the average rates in the pre - storm and storm periods of 0.054@xmath120.002 and 0.055@xmath120.002 cts sec@xmath1 , although we see some rapid rises before data gaps ( e.g. , at doy of 236.4 ) and a gradual change around doy of 236.55 .",
    "several data points both in 0.50.7 and 2.55 kev show the very rapid short term increases in the storm period .",
    "the scattering of solar x - rays is known to vary depending on the elevation angle ( elv ) of the line of sight from earth rim . because suzaku orbits around earth once per @xmath1490 min , a part of the observation suffers from earth occultation .",
    "the periodic data gaps seen in figure [ fig : cur1 ] correspond to such occultations .",
    "the high count rate bins are seen just before the occultation when the elv angle is relatively small @xmath145 deg .",
    "thus , the observed short - term enhancements are most probably scattering of solar x - rays .",
    "a detailed spectral analysis will be done in  [ sec : sec : scattering ] .    using the same time axis , we plot the sym - h index provided by the world data center for geomagnetism , kyoto , japan , and the solar proton flux as measured by wind .",
    "the sym - h index is an indicator of the total energy content of the ring current almost similar to the hourly dst index but with a high time resolution ( 1 min ) @xcite .",
    "the sym - h index exhibits three prototypical periods of the geomagnetic storm .",
    "the first period is a storm sudden commencement ( ssc ) at doy of 236.26 , corresponding to a sharp rise of the sym - h index , when the cme - induced shock arrived at earth .",
    "the second one is the storm main phase consisting of a dramatic decrease of the sym - h index to a minimum value ( -174 nt ) when a ring current around earth is built up due to high energy particle enhancements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the final one is the storm recovery phase seen from doy of 236.45 when the sym - h index had a minimum value .",
    "the solar wind proton data taken with wind provides more information on the solar wind propagation toward earth .",
    "the wind satellite at this observation time was around the sunward l1 lagrangian point , approximately 230 earth radii ( @xmath15 ) from earth .",
    "from the solar wind proton flux and solar wind dynamic pressure in figure [ fig : cur1 ] , discontinuous rises can be seen at doy of 236.23 that should be related to the cme - induced shock . assuming the average proton speed during the observation of 530 km s@xmath1 , an expected delay of the solar wind to move from the l1 point to earth becomes 0.03 days .",
    "therefore , an estimated arrival time of the shock at earth considering the delay becomes doy of 236.26 that coincides well with the ssc , i.e. , the onset of the geomagnetic storm , seen in the ground - based sym - h index .",
    "compared to the sym - h index and solar wind , the enhancements of the x - ray light curves in 0.50.7 and 2.55.0 kev occurred after the ssc and the increase of the solar wind proton flux as well as the dynamic pressure .",
    "therefore , the x - ray enhancements should be closely related to the increased solar wind near earth .",
    "more specifically , the soft x - ray enhancement is indicative of the exospheric swcx emission induced by the cme , while that in the hard x - ray band can be related to increased particle backgrounds .    to check whether this time variability is due to leaked photons from the bright x - ray sources , we created ratio maps between the storm and pre - storm periods as shown in figure [ fig : divimg ] . in 0.50.7 kev",
    ", the tdx region shows a factor of @xmath142 increase , while the bright x - ray sources are rather steady . in 25 kev ,",
    "the entire field of view becomes steady .",
    "therefore , the soft x - ray enhancements must be related to the geomagnetic storm and not due to changes in the leaked photons from the bright x - ray sources .",
    "we extracted the xis spectra of the tdx region during the pre - storm and storm periods as shown in figure [ fig : spec1 ] .",
    "backgrounds are not subtracted .",
    "the xis bi spectrum during the storm period ( green ) clearly shows an excess below @xmath141 kev compared to that in the pre - storm period ( black ) .",
    "signatures of the carbon ( @xmath16 kev ) , nitrogen ( @xmath17 kev ) and oxygen ( 0.50.6 kev ) emission lines are seen .",
    "there is also a spectrally smooth excess above @xmath142 kev . on the other hand ,",
    "the fi spectrum during the storm period exhibits a clear excess only below 1 kev .",
    "because the fi ccds have a higher sensitivity above 1 kev than the bi , the hard x - ray excess seen in the bi spectrum will not arise from x - ray photons but particle backgrounds .",
    "ionization particles such as soft protons can produce this spectrally smooth , flat , wide - band , whole field - of - view signal ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these particles are funnelled by the telescope onto the ccd , and generate signals .",
    "the bi ccd is considered to be more susceptible to the particle background than the fi because of absence of circuital structures upon a pixel .",
    "the increased proton flux seen in the storm period ( figure [ fig : cur1 ] ) supports this hypothesis .    to evaluate the instrumental non x - ray background ( nxb ) in the two periods",
    ", we utilized the xisnxbgen software developed by @xcite .",
    "they constructed an nxb database by collecting xis data when the dark earth covers the xis field of view .",
    "the nxb spectra ( red and blue ) of the bi coincide with the tdx spectrum in the pre - storm period ( black ) above @xmath18 kev , where the nxb dominates the signal .",
    "this is a proof of a reliable estimation of the nxb .",
    "we supposed that the excess of the tdx spectra against the nxb except for the particle continuum originate from the sky background including diffuse galactic and extragalactic emission and leaked photons from the bright x - ray sources within the field of view .",
    "we wished to investigate the pre - storm period , in order to quantify the sky background and contribution from the bright x - ray sources . for the spectral fitting , we subtracted the nxb from the tdx spectra , and created rmf and arf files .",
    "we used the xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen programs in the heasoft package . for the arf files",
    ", we assumed uniform emission from a region of radius 20 arcmin and corrected obtained x - ray fluxes in spectral fittings for the area of the tdx region . since we used the @xmath19 statistic for our spectral fitting , we binned the spectra to a minimum of 20 counts per bin . in the spectral fitting model",
    ", we took into account two representative diffuse x - ray backgrounds : the local hot bubble ( lhb ) and the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "we assumed the raymond - smith thin - thermal plasma model with @xmath200.1 kev for lhb based on @xcite .",
    "we also used the model id1 in table 2 of @xcite for cxb .",
    "in addition , to account for a potential contribution from the bright x - ray sources within the field of view , we used models in the works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the composite spectrum from the pulsar and pwn can be modelled by an absorbed power law with @xmath21 @xmath10 and @xmath22 .",
    "the spectrum of rcw 89 is represented by an absorbed non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model with @xmath23 @xmath10 and @xmath24 kev . from table 1 of @xcite",
    ", we assumed the ionization parameter @xmath25 of 6.3@xmath26 s @xmath27 and the elemental abundances of 0 , 0.18 , 0.49 , 0.26 , 1.12 , and 1.1@xmath28 solar for o , ne , mg , si s , and fe , respectively .",
    "the solar elemental abundance table by @xcite was used . to estimate the contribution from these sources ,",
    "we let only the normalizations of these four models free .    after fitting tests",
    ", we found that the surface brightness of the cxb component is @xmath145 times smaller than the observed continuum .",
    "hence , we fixed all the spectral parameters of cxb as described in @xcite .",
    "we also found that there is a residual around 0.50.6 kev , most probably from the neutral oxygen line , and hence added a gaussian model .",
    "because the spectral fitting was not acceptable at this stage , we finally let the temperature and abundance of fe in the nei model free .",
    "the obtained result is shown in figure [ fig : spec2 ] and table [ tbl : spec2 ] .",
    "below the errors are 90% confidence range unless otherwise are noted .",
    "the model represents the data well with a @xmath19/d.o.f .",
    "it is evident from figure [ fig : spec2 ] that the soft sky background model dominates the spectrum below 0.7 kev , while the bright x - ray source models reproduce the data above 0.7 kev .",
    "the obtained surface brightness of the lhb , 1.7@xmath2910@xmath30 erg s@xmath1 @xmath10 arcmin@xmath31 , is consistent with the previous observations @xcite .",
    "the best - fit temperature of the nei model also coincides with the temperature of rcw 89 ( 0.39@xmath120.05 kev in @xcite ) within errors , while the iron abundance is an order of magnitude higher .",
    "we estimated that a contribution from the pwn and rcw 89 to the tdx region is @xmath142 and 7 % of their total emission , respectively .",
    "here we cited @xcite and @xcite for the total x - ray fluxes from the pwn and rcw 89 , respectively .",
    "these numbers are reasonable if we consider the angular response of the suzaku x - ray telescope ( see figure 12 in @xcite ) .",
    "when a point source is located at the center of xis , 2@xmath143% photons fall outside @xmath32 arcmin .",
    "because the pwn and rcw89 are extended , more photons will fall within the tdx region , which is located @xmath33 arcmin from the aimpoint .",
    "the larger percentage of the thermal nei component compared to the power - law can be explained by an extra sky background , a so - called transabsorption emission ( tae ) @xcite .",
    "the tae is considered to arise from distant part of the galaxy , above or beyond the bulk absorption of the galactic disk .",
    "its spectrum is described by a thermal emission model with @xmath20 0.3 kev , comparable to the temperature of rcw 89 .",
    "its flux varies depending on the line of direction @xcite .",
    "the tae may also explain the fe line abundance of the nei component .",
    "having known that the pre - storm spectrum is dominated by the soft sky background below 1 kev and by the contamination from the bright x - ray sources above 1 kev , we proceeded to study the tdx emission in the storm period .",
    "as suggested from figure [ fig : spec1 ] , the major difference between the storm and pre - storm period concentrates below 1 kev . considering the higher sensitivity of the bi than that of the fi , below we only analyze the xis bi spectrum .",
    "firstly we investigated the scattering of solar x - rays that was suggested by the x - ray light curve ( figure [ fig : cur1 ] ) and the spectrum during the pre - storm period ( figure [ fig : spec2 ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : goes ] , the goes12 solar x - ray fluxes in two energy bands are plotted .",
    "the data were taken from the national geophysical data center .",
    "an m - class flare occurred at doy of 235.6 during the pre - storm period .",
    "the average x - ray fluxes during the pre - storm period in 18    or 1.5512.4 kev and 0.53    or 4.1324.8 kev were 3.4@xmath34 and 4.2@xmath35 w m@xmath31 , while those during the storm periods were 8.0@xmath35 and 4.2@xmath36 w m@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "although the level of the solar x - rays are lower in the storm period , atmospheric expansion associated with the cme can cause an increase of the fluorescence line(s ) in the storm period .    with this thought in mind , we changed the data filtering criteria on the elv angle .",
    "the default criteria for the screened data is elv@xmath375 deg . in order to investigate a potential difference",
    ", we adopted more stringent elv criteria ( elv@xmath3710 , 20 , and 30 deg ) .",
    "figure [ fig : spec3 ] shows the xis bi spectra for the four elv criteria .",
    "an increase of a neutral oxygen line at @xmath140.53 kev is recognized in the elv@xmath38 deg spectrum , while there is no significant change between elv@xmath39 and @xmath40 deg in 0.25 kev .",
    "we obtained the bi spectrum when elv is 5@xmath1410 deg by subtracting the elv@xmath39 deg spectrum from that with elv@xmath38 deg .",
    "figure [ fig : spec4 ] is the spectrum after this subtraction .",
    "the data is modelled with a single narrow gaussian model .",
    "the parameters are summarized in table [ tbl : spec4 ] .",
    "the line center energy is consistent with the neutral oxygen k line of 0.524 kev @xcite . by adopting the elv criteria of @xmath39 deg",
    ", we also noticed that the shape of the light curve also changes .",
    "the high count rate events are suppressed .",
    "our result warns that , even if the solar x - ray flux is not high , the standard suzaku data screening criteria of elv @xmath38 deg is not sufficient to remove the scattering component , when the atmospheric density rises after cmes .",
    "we then analyzed possible enhancements by the exospheric swcx . to remove the solar x - ray scattering effect , we screened the data with the elv@xmath3710 deg criteria . in order to see differences between the pre - storm and storm periods , we subtracted the pre - storm period spectrum from the storm period . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec5 ] ( a ) , we plot the obtained spectrum .",
    "it is evident from figure [ fig : spec5 ] ( a ) that the excess clearly contains emission lines between 0.2 and 0.7 kev .",
    "the spectrum is built up from a series of emission lines from carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen lines .",
    "the spectrum was modelled with seven narrow gaussians , but the fitting was not statistically acceptable ( @xmath19/d.o.f . of 1.91 ) . in table",
    "[ tbl : spec5 ] , we list the obtained parameters .",
    "we then tested a theoretical swcx emission line model developed by @xcite ( table 8.2 ) , which accounts for the relative emission cross sections for the lines from each of several ions , specifically c , c , n , n , o , and o. in total , 33 lines are involved in this model . @xcite",
    "have successfully fitted the exospheric swcx spectrum taken with xmm - newton .",
    "we used the tabulated values for a velocity of 600 km s@xmath1 , because the average solar wind velocity during the storm period is 530 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we allowed the six normalizations of the ions to be free .",
    "we also added an extra gaussian to reproduce the lowest energy emission line around 0.25 kev , which is not included in the bodewits s swcx model .",
    "in figure [ fig : spec5 ] ( b ) , we plot the fit results . this swcx model reproduced the data significantly better than the simple sum of gaussians with @xmath19/d.o.f . of 1.46 .",
    "the obtained parameters are listed in table [ tbl : spec5 - 2 ] .",
    "this acceptable fitting supports the idea that the soft x - ray enhancements during the storm period is due to the exospheric swcx .",
    "the emission line identified around 0.45 kev mainly arises from the @xmath414 to 1 transition of c vi at 459 ev , which is hardly seen in a normal astrophysical plasma and hence is another line of evidence for the exospheric swcx @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio ] shows the best - fitting swcx line energy flux ratio to o compared to the xmm - newton observation of cme - induced exospheric swcx by @xcite . while the relative flux ratios from c to n are similar , the absolute values in this suzaku observation are an order of magnitude higher .",
    "indeed , the o line was prominent in @xcite , while o dominates in this observation . we will examine whether this difference can be explained by differences in the incident solar wind o@xmath3 and o@xmath42 fluxes and swcx cross sections in  [ sec : int ] .    to investigate a potential influence of the hard continuum originating from the particle background ,",
    "we fitted the 15 kev bi spectrum in the storm period after the subtraction of the pre - storm spectrum with a power - law .",
    "the fitting was acceptable with @xmath19/d.o.f .",
    "of 229/190@xmath43 .",
    "the best - fit photon index and normalization were @xmath44 and @xmath45 photon s@xmath1 @xmath10 str@xmath1 ( line unit , lu ) at 1 kev , respectively .",
    "we then extrapolated this power law continuum into the low energy band .",
    "we again fitted the bi spectrum shown in figure [ fig : spec5 ] with a sum of the power law and the swcx line models .",
    "we fixed the photon index and normalization of the power - law component .",
    "we then found that all the line normalizations are reduced by 5@xmath46 % but almost all of these parameters are within 90% confidence range listed in table [ tbl : spec5 - 2 ] .",
    "therefore , the particle continuum may be minor in the low energy band , in comparison with the swcx lines .",
    "an x - ray flux of the exospheric swcx emission can be estimated from an incident solar wind flux and a neutral column density of the exosphere in the line of sight . to assist in this analysis",
    ", we utilized the solar wind oxygen ion flux as measured by ace swics .",
    "we compared the o@xmath3 flux with the xis bi 0.520.6 kev o count rate . to eliminate the contribution of the neutral oxygen line ,",
    "the xis data are filtered with the criteria of elv@xmath3710 deg .",
    "figure [ fig : cur2 ] shows the xis bi 0.520.6 kev light curve compared to the sym - h index , wind proton flux , and ace o@xmath3 ion flux . as we wrote in ",
    "[ sec : sec : scattering ] , there is no sign of very high count rate bins due to the scattering of solar x - rays after we filtered the data with the elv@xmath39 deg criterion .",
    "similar to figure [ fig : cur1 ] , the x - ray enhancement started after the onset of the geomagnetic storm at doy of 236.25 , supporting that the x - ray rise is due to the increased solar wind near earth and the resultant exospheric swcx .    before checking the relation between the x - ray and ion fluxes",
    ", we conducted a cross - correlation analysis to know of any time delay between these two data .",
    "this procedure requires that both light curves are taken in equally - spaced time intervals .",
    "unfortunately , the ace ion data has rather low time resolution ( 2 hr average ) and hence we had to bin the xis bi curve into 8192 s bin . to consider different time bins of these two curves",
    ", we interpolated the ace data to match the xis curve in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "we then utilized the crosscorr software in the heasoft package with the default mathematical algorithm and normalization method .    in figure",

    "the correlation coefficient has a peak ( 0.79 ) at a time delay of 0@xmath148192 s. a null hypothesis probability is @xmath4710@xmath48 , corresponding to @xmath49 significance .",
    "the obtained time delay coincides with the expected value of @xmath50 hr . because the ace satellite orbits at the l1 point and suzaku is in the low earth orbit , about 1 hr time delay is expected between these two data ( see  [ sec : lc ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : corr1 ] , we plot a relation between the o count rate and the solar wind o@xmath3 ion flux .",
    "because the estimated time delay is consistent with 1 hr , i.e. , within the bin size of the light curve , we did not correct the data for the time delay .",
    "we can see that two quantities are correlated .",

    "we checked the relation assuming the time delay of 8192 s , and found a similar increase .",
    "the sparse o@xmath3 data motivated us to utilize the high time resolution proton data . using the proton data ( 100 s average ) , we checked the time delay and then checked the correlation between the solar wind proton flux and o count rate , in the same way as the ion data .",
    "figure [ fig : cross2 ] shows the cross correlation .",
    "a broad peak is seen in the range of 0@xmath51 sec .",
    "this range covers the expected time delay of 1 hr , although the peak is slightly shifted at the positive side ( @xmath52 sec ) , suggesting that there could be an additional positive delay .",
    "figure [ fig : corr2 ] displays a correlation between the o count rate and the solar wind proton flux . a time delay of 1 hr is assumed based on the satellite positions .",
    "the data is represented by a linear function expressed as , @xmath53 } = a \\times c_{\\rm proton}~ { \\rm [ 10 ^ 5~ cm^{-2}~ s^{-1 } ] } + b,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 represents the swcx emissivity and @xmath55 is an offset emission due to the instrumental and sky background .",
    "the fitting was acceptable with @xmath19/d.o.f .",
    "@xmath6119.5/106 . the best fit @xmath54 and @xmath55 are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the positive @xmath55 suggests that , even if the solar wind flux is zero , there remains an certain level of background emission .",
    "since the nxb is minor as seen in figure [ fig : spec1 ] , a large part of @xmath55 must arise from the sky background .",
    "we converted @xmath55 into the photon flux in units of lu based on the o fitting in figure [ fig : spec5 ] .",
    "then , @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath58 lu .",
    "@xcite reported that the o line intensity from the soft x - ray background consisting of lhb , tae and heliospheric swcx ranges from 2 to 10 lu .",
    "thus , we can interpret @xmath55 as the sum of these sky backgrounds .",

    "we found @xmath61 from @xcite and used @xmath63 of 0.0083 from @xcite .",
    "we estimated the solar x - ray spectrum based on the goes data ( figure [ fig : goes ] ) as below .",
    "the solar x - ray spectrum is known to be variable and can be expressed by a multi - temperature thin thermal plasma model with the temperature of 0.1@xmath143 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for simplicity , we assumed a single temperature plasma and estimated the plasma temperature from the ratio of the two - band goes x - ray fluxes .",
    "we utilized the mekal model in the xspec software package to simulate the solar x - ray spectrum .",
    "the average ratios during the pre - storm and storm periods indicate plasma temperatures of 1.35 kev and 0.98 kev , respectively .",
    "we tuned the normalization of the mekal model so that the the goes two - band fluxes are reproduced .",
    "we then multiplied the cross section , fluorescent yield , and solar x - ray spectrum , and then integrated the term as a function of energy from 1 kev , i.e. , above the oxygen k - edge ( 0.54 kev ) , to 25 kev .",
    "we here used 1 kev as a first trial taking into account the lowest energy of the goes x - ray data ( 1.55 kev ) used to estimate the solar x - ray spectrum .",
    "we divided the observed flux by this integral and obtained the necessary @xmath65 . in the pre - storm period ,",
    "the observed oxygen line flux was @xmath66 lu ( table [ tbl : spec2 ] ) .",
    "then , the necessary @xmath65 becomes @xmath67 @xmath10 . in the storm period ,",
    "the line flux was increased by @xmath68 lu ( table [ tbl : spec4 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to rise of @xmath65 by @xmath69 @xmath10 .",
    "thus , a factor of @xmath3710 increase in the column density is suggested .",
    "this increase is due to the fact that the solar x - ray intensity was 2 times stronger in the pre - storm period , while the observed neutral oxygen line flux was @xmath375 times weaker compared to that in the storm period .    for comparison ,",
    "we estimated @xmath65 by integrating the atmospheric neutral oxygen atom and molecules of the sun lit atmosphere in the line of sight , using the nrlmsis2000 empirical model @xcite .",
    "this is an empirical temperature and density model of the earth s atmosphere from ground to space .",
    "we calculated the geodetic latitude , longitude , and altitude of the suzaku satellite , and integrated the o@xmath70o@xmath71 density as a function of time .",
    "the density is estimated by a 10 km step from the altitude of suzaku ( @xmath72 km during the observation ) to 1000 km , and then integrated by multiplying the density at each place by 10 km .",
    "the nrlmsis2000 model provides us with @xmath65 as a function of time .",
    "we extracted the average @xmath65 in the pre - storm and storm periods . because the scattering component is seen only in low elv angles ( 5@xmath1410 deg )",
    ", we averaged @xmath65 over this elv range .",
    "the estimated @xmath65 in the pre - storm and storm periods were @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "this theoretical column density in the storm period coincides with the observation - based value within a factor of 2 , while that in the pre - storm period is 20 times larger .",
    "there are two major uncertainties in our estimation .",
    "the first one is the assumed lower energy of the solar x - ray spectrum ( 1 kev ) .",
    "if we integrate the spectrum down to 0.54 kev , @xmath65 decreases to @xmath750.5@xmath76 and 7@xmath76 @xmath10 for the pre - storm and storm phases , respectively , owe to the increased solar x - ray photons .",
    "if we adopt the lower energy of the goes data ( 1.55 kev ) , @xmath65 become @xmath753@xmath77 and 1@xmath78 @xmath10 .",
    "these numbers can be considered as conservative upper limits .",
    "the other is the nrlmsis2000 model itself .",
    "comparison of the model with the satellite drag data indicates that there can be a factor of 2 difference @xcite .",
    "for example , from the incoherent scatter in the polar upper atmosphere , @xcite found that a h density at 600 km altitude is roughly five times higher than the model .",
    "therefore , a factor of 2@xmath145 error can reside in the model .",
    "thus , the observed discrepancy can be reduced by these uncertainties , although the increased @xmath65 in the geomagnetic storm , which was not reproduced in the nrlmsis2000 model , will be left as a future issue .",
    "next , we estimated the intensity of the exospheric swcx emission .",
    "this is expressed by the equation below .",
    "@xmath79 } , % % [ photon~ s^{-1}~ cm^{-2}~ str^{-1 } ] } , \\label{eq : swcx}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 accounts for the charge exchange cross section and line emission probability , @xmath81 is the incident solar wind flux , and @xmath82 is the column density of target hydrogen atoms in the earth s exosphere .    to calculate @xmath82 for the observed o line in the storm period , we used @xmath80 of 6@xmath83 @xmath10 from @xcite , assuming that all transitions are equally probable . the average ace o@xmath3 ion flux of @xmath84 @xmath10 s@xmath1 was used as @xmath85 .",
    "then , the observed line flux @xmath85 of @xmath1434 lu provided @xmath82 of @xmath86 @xmath10 .    as a consistency check , we estimated an average @xmath82 from the o line in the same way .",
    "we used @xmath80 of 4@xmath83 @xmath10 based on @xcite , the o@xmath42 flux of @xmath87 @xmath10 s@xmath1 , and the observed o flux of @xmath1413 lu .",
    "the obtained @xmath82 was @xmath88 @xmath10 , a factor of 3 larger than the value estimated for the o line .",
    "this discrepancy may be explained by uncertainties in the assumed parameters such as the solar wind oxygen ion fluxes measured with ace and/or @xmath80 .",
    "for instance , if the solar wind velocity in the reaction region is lower ( e.g. , 200 km s@xmath1 ) than what we assumed , @xmath80 for the o line can decrease down to 2.7@xmath83 @xmath10 and @xmath82 will increase by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "since @xmath82 estimated from the o line will decrease only by 10% in this case , a part of the discrepancy can be accounted for . if this is the case , the high line flux ratio to the o in this observation ( figure [ fig : ratio ] ) may originate from a relatively low o@xmath42 ion flux compared to that in @xcite .    for comparison , we estimated the neutral density of hydrogen atoms in the earth s exosphere .",
    "we used the @xcite model @xmath89 for the hydrogen density profile around earth and limits this to a minimum density of 0.4 @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "@xmath82 can be deduced from the integration of the density in the line of sight as below , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the distance to the nearest point in the line of sight where the solar wind interacts with the exosphere and @xmath92 is the end point of the integration .",
    "we roughly assumed @xmath91 and @xmath92 of 6 and 200 @xmath15 , considering the line of sight geometry ( figure [ fig : los ] ) .",
    "here we calculated the geocentric distance of the point where the geomagnetic field becomes open to space for the first time in the line of sight in the same way as @xcite and defined an average distance during the observation as @xmath91 .",
    "that is , the region should mainly correspond to the magnetosheath .",
    "then , @xmath82 became 2@xmath93 @xmath10 .",
    "hence , this empirical estimation is @xmath143 and 10 times smaller than the observation - based values for o and o , respectively .",
    "one possibility for this inconsistency is the neutral hydrogen density model itself",
    ". the hydrogen density may be higher than the model .",
    "another is that more solar wind ions enter into the magnetosphere than we assumed , i.e. , @xmath94 . in this case",
    ", the swcx reaction occurs near earth where the exospheric density is high , leading to a larger theoretical @xmath82 .",
    "the latter hypothesis might be supported by other observational facts .",
    "firstly , the x - ray enhancement in figures [ fig : cur1 ] and [ fig : cur2 ] coincides with a peak of the geomagnetic storm , corresponding to the duration when many solar wind ions entered into the earth s inner magnetosphere and caused disturbed ring currents .",
    "secondly , the cross correlation between the high resolution wind proton data and suzaku light curve ( figure [ fig : cross2 ] ) suggests that a positive delay exists even after considering the satellite positions .",
    "thirdly , the exospheric swcx in the magnetosheath direction found by @xcite was an order of magnitude brighter than the model calculation assuming that the swcx occurs outside the magnetopause .",
    "the invasion of the solar wind inside the magnetopause and resultant swcx reaction can explain the inconsistency as well .",
    "@xcite suggested that the o@xmath95 ions are transported to the inner magnetosphere from the high - latitude magnetopause in august - september 1998 storms driven by cmes .",
    "this result seems to be consistent with the suggestion from the suzaku observations ; the o@xmath96 ions may enter into the high - latitude magnetopause through the magnetosheath region . to verify this hypothesis",
    ", we need an accurate calculation of solar wind transportation and swcx reaction and ideally should conduct a direct imaging of the exospheric swcx at a distant position from earth in future space missions .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated terrestrial diffuse x - ray emission associated with the strong geomagnetic storm driven by cmes on 2005 august 23 - 24 using suzaku data .",
    "this geomagnetic storm was the strongest in terms of the dst index after the suzaku launch , as of 2011 april .",
    "we found that this event was a textbook case and provided us with a very good opportunity to study the scattering of solar x - rays and the exospheric swcx .",
    "we have obtained following results .    *",
    "the x - ray light curve in 0.21 kev showed a factor of 2 enhancement , while that in 25 kev was almost constant .",
    "the enhancement coincided with the geomagnetic storm and increase of solar wind proton and o@xmath3 fluxes . * the x - ray spectrum in the pre - storm period",
    "was explained by the sum of diffuse sky background and leaked photons from bright x - ray sources within the field of view . *",
    "the soft x - ray enhancement in the storm period consisted of two types of terrestrial diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "one is the fluorescent scattering of solar x - rays by earth s low altitude atmosphere seen in low elv angles ( @xmath97 deg ) .",
    "the other is the exospheric swcx from highly ionized carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen .",
    "after the removal of the scattering component , the x - ray spectrum was well represented by the bodewits s swcx model . *",
    "a cross correlation analysis was conducted between the swcx o line and the low time - resolution solar wind o@xmath3 data .",
    "the estimated time delay of @xmath98 hr was consistent with the expected travelling time of the solar wind ( 1 hr ) .",
    "the relation between the o count rate and solar wind o@xmath3 flux showed a possible positive correlation . *",
    "the cross correlation between the o count rate and the high time resolution solar wind proton flux suggests the existence of an extra delay in addition to the 1 hr delay due to the solar wind travelling time from the satellite position to earth .",
    "the relation between the o count rate and the solar wind proton flux was well represented by a linear function .",
    "a positive offset in the linear relation suggests that , even if the solar wind flux is zero , there remains a certain amount of x - ray flux due to the sky backgrounds .",
    "* from the observed neutral oxygen line intensity , the column density of oxygen atoms and molecules @xmath65 was estimated as @xmath99 and @xmath69 @xmath10 in the pre - storm and storm periods , respectively .",
    "these values are compared with the theoretical nrlmsis2000 model .",
    "@xmath65 estimated by the two methods can be consistent with each other considering uncertainties , although a factor of @xmath100 increase was not consistent with the model and hence will be left as a future issue for the model . * similarly , the column density of neutral hydrogen atoms for the exospheric swcx was estimated as @xmath101 @xmath10 from the observed o and o line fluxes , while the @xcite model predicts @xmath102 @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the calculation may underestimate the neutral column density by a factor of 3@xmath1410 . *",
    "the small column density based on the exospheric density model suggests that our assumption on the swcx reaction region is not proper and a part of solar wind may enter inside the magnetosphere where the hydrogen density is high .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated that the fluorescent scattering and exospheric swcx in combination with the solar wind data are quite useful to examine the earth s atmospheric density models . following to @xcite",
    ", we conducted the cross correlation analysis and checked the relationship between the x - ray line and solar wind ion flux .",
    "this set of analyses must help to study the exospheric density and can provide a global view of the transportation of heavy ion originating from the sun into geospace , which may contribute to the evolution of a geomagnetic storm .",
