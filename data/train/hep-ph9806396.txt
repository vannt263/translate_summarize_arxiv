    "in hadron interactions , the leading particle effect manifests as an enhancement in the production rate of particles which share valence quarks with the initial hadrons . as a consequence of the leading particle effect",
    ", strong asymmetries are expected in the @xmath8 inclusive differential cross sections for particles and anti - particles when the content of valence quarks shared by the produced particle and anti - particle with the initial hadrons is different .",
    "this effect has been extensively studied , from both the experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite points of view in charm hadron production .    in the production of strange baryons , the same type of leading effects",
    "are expected . indeed , there is some evidence of asymmetries in @xmath9 production in @xmath10cu interactions at 230 gev/@xmath5  @xcite and in @xmath11 and @xmath1 production in 250 gev/@xmath5 @xmath6 interactions  @xcite",
    ". some additional evidence for @xmath11 asymmetry can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , but , in general , hyperon production asymmetries in @xmath6 interactions were not systematically studied until recently , when the fermilab e791 experiment presented preliminary results on hyperon production in @xmath6 interactions at @xmath4 gev/@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the e791 experiment has measured particle / anti - particle production asymmetries in both the small @xmath12 and @xmath13 regions for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 hyperons .",
    "the results obtained by the e791 experiment show a large asymmetry in the @xmath12 region for @xmath0 production and a lower asymmetry , in the same region , for @xmath1 production . in the @xmath13 region ,",
    "an approximately constant asymmetry with @xmath3 is observed for @xmath1 and @xmath0 hyperons .",
    "the asymmetry measured for @xmath2 production is approximately constant in the whole @xmath14 region .    these results in the @xmath12 region are consistent with the fact that @xmath15 hyperons share a @xmath16 diquark whereas the @xmath17s share a @xmath18 quark with the target particles ( protons and neutrons ) , so a lower asymmetry is expected for the later since the @xmath15 is a double leading whereas the @xmath17 is a leading particle . in the @xmath13 region ,",
    "the @xmath17 share a @xmath18 quark with the initial @xmath10 , being a leading particle , while @xmath19 shares none .",
    "then a growing asymmetry with @xmath3 is expected in @xmath1 production .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath20 each have one valence quark in common with the beam @xmath10 and , therefore , have equal enhancement i.e. , no asymmetry is expected from this effect .",
    "the @xmath2 hyperons are both non - leading in all the @xmath3 regions studied and , consequently , no asymmetry is expected in @xmath2 production in @xmath6 interactions .    due to the smallness of the strange quark mass and the @xmath21 values involved , hyperon production can not be accounted for in the usual framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "the recombination scheme , initially introduced by das and hwa  @xcite , appears to be a possible framework to deal with the non - perturbative qcd aspects involved in hadron and , in particular , in hyperon production .",
    "indeed , this type of model has been used succesfuly to describe charmed particle / anti - particle asymmetries  @xcite in hadroproduction .    in this work ,",
    "we compare the predictions of a simple version of the recombination model on hyperon / anti - hyperon production asymmetries with the preliminary results of the e791 experiment .",
    "the good qualitative agreement found between model predictions and experimental data even at small values of @xmath3 shows that it might be interesting to make efforts to improve the outcome of the model .",
    "the recombination model was introduced long time ago by das and hwa  @xcite to describe meson production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "a simple extension of the model was made by ranft  @xcite to calculate baryon production . from those first attempts up to now",
    ", several modifications have been introduced trying to improve the outcome of the model  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the recombination model remains a simple approach to deal with some non - perturbative aspects of qcd involved in hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "the basic idea behind recombination is that the produced hadrons are formed from the debris of the fragmented beam ( in the forward region ) or target ( in the backward direction ) particles in such a way that partons initially in the incoming particles _ recombine _ into the final hadrons .",
    "all that is needed to deal with the problem is to know the distribution of partons in the initial particles , which are measured in deep inelastic scattering experiments , and the so - called recombination function which will take into account all aspects involved in the recombination of partons into a hadron .",
    "of course , the recombination function has a phenomenological origin , since no calculation from first principles is yet possible to obtain it .    for a generic hyperon @xmath22 , the @xmath3 inclusive distribution in recombination is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the center of mass energy in the @xmath25 reaction , @xmath26 is the energy of the outgoing hyperon and @xmath27 is a normalization constant . in eq .",
    "( [ rec ] ) , @xmath28 is the three - quark distribution , which contains the distribution of valence quarks in the final particle inside the beam or target hadrons , @xmath29 is the recombination function and @xmath30 is the momentum fraction of the @xmath31 quark with respect to the initial particle .    following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the three quark distribution function is assumed to be of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 contains the single quark distribution , @xmath34 , of the @xmath35 valence quark of the final hyperon in the initial particle .",
    "note that @xmath36 includes valence as well as sea quark contributions from the initial hadron .",
    "the coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 are fixed using the consistency condition @xmath39 which must be valid for the valence quarks in the initial particle .",
    "for the recombination function we use  @xcite @xmath40 allowing in this way a different weight for the heavier @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) quark than for the light @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and",
    "@xmath18 ( @xmath45 ) quarks .    the constant @xmath46 in eq .  ( [ eq7 ] )",

    "@xmath27 may be fixed from experimental data .",
    "the asymmetry as a function of @xmath3 is defined by @xmath49 where @xmath22 is the hyperon and @xmath50 is the anti - hyperon .    replacing eq .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , the predictions of the recombination model agree qualitatively well with the experimental data .    in the negative @xmath3 region ,",
    "the growth of the asymmetry predicted by the model with the number of valence quarks shared by the leading hyperons and the target particles is in a remarkable agreement with the e791 data . in this region ,",
    "the asymmetry as a function of @xmath3 is also qualitatively well described by the model .",
    "the agreement between data and model predictions is better as @xmath62 rises .",
    "this is possibly due to the fact that , at very low values of @xmath62 , other mechanisms than recombination are competitive in the hadronization .    in the positive @xmath3 region , although the leading effect in @xmath1 production is qualitatively accounted for by the model , in general , the agreement between data and recombination model predictions is poorer than in the negative @xmath3 region .",
    "note , however , that the quark distributions in pions are not as well known as in nucleons , being one of the possible causes of the discrepancies between model prediction and data in this region .",
    "the asymmetry predicted for @xmath2 production is constant over all the @xmath3 region under study .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the @xmath63 and the @xmath64 are both non - leading particles over the whole @xmath3 region from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .    in conclusion , the recombination model , although simple , is able to reproduce qualitatively the behaviour of the experimental data on hyperon / anti - hyperon asymmetries , so it might be possibly of interest to make efforts in order to improve the outcome of the model .    for a meaningful quantitative comparison between data and model predictions ,",
    "however , the individual inclusive @xmath3 distributions for leading and non - leading particles must be taken into account .",
