    "at first glance , it would seem that the hamiltonian dynamics of nonrelativistic , classical test particles in the linearized gravity limit has been thoroughly studied , and is well understood .",
    "indeed , in this limit gravitational waves ( gws ) are often treated as simply a spin-2 gauge field propagating in flat minkowski spacetime @xcite , and the coupling of gws to matter would seem to follow naturally .",
    "this determination would be premature ; we show in this paper that such an approach obfuscates the underlying physics of the system , and overlooks the surprising links between gravitational waves , vector potentials , and gauge symmetries .",
    "much of our current understanding of the coupling of matter to gravity comes from attempts at constructing quantum gravity ( qg ) @xcite , and from the theory of quantum fields in curved spacetime ( qfcs ) @xcite .",
    "once the lagrangians for various elementary particlesboth gauge and nongaugewere determined in flat minkowski spacetime , their extension to curved spacetimes was a natural next step . to make this extension of the flat spacetime lagrangians to curved spacetimes ,",
    "a number of seemingly natural assumptions were typically made then , and are still being made now .",
    "the expectation is that the experience and intuition gained from constructing quantum field theories ( qfts ) in flat spacetime will serve as useful guides in constructing qfts in curved spacetimes . thus , flat spacetime lagrangians for bosonic fields are promoted to curved spacetimes by replacing the minkowski metric with the metric for a curved spacetime , the partial derivative with the covariant derivative , and the lorentz - invariant integration measure with the general - coordinate - transformation - invariant integration measure .",
    "the extension of fermionic fields , such as spin-1/2 and -3/2 fermions , follow in much the same way once a tetrad frame is chosen .",
    "the hilbert action from classical general relativity ( gr ) is used for the gravity component of the theory , and the metric for the spacetime @xmath1 is identified with the gravitational field s degree of freedom .",
    "a classical background metric @xmath2 for the spacetime is chosenin @xcite it was flat minkowski spacetime , and in @xcite it was either an asymptotically flat spacetime or a spacetime with finite spatial extentand the propagating component of the gravitational field is extracted from the theory by considering fluctuations @xmath3 about @xmath2 combined with a suitable gauge ( coordinate ) choice .",
    "these fluctuationsrepresenting gravitational waves ( gws ) in gr and gravitons in qgare then expanded about @xmath2 assuming that @xmath4 are small compared to @xmath2 , and are subsequently treated as simply another spin-2 non - abelian gauge field propagating in the background spacetime . by also expanding the metric terms about @xmath2 in the lagrangians for the matter fields ,",
    "one obtains terms that couple gwsor gravitons in qgwith matter .",
    "these interaction terms would then seem to be fixed by the field s corresponding flat spacetime lagrangians combined with the standard prescription for promoting them to curved spacetimes .    as natural , and as straightforward ,",
    "as the above prescription is for determining the coupling of matter to gravity , it nevertheless makes a number of implicit assumptions .",
    "when one tries to reconcile these assumptions with classical gr , a number of troubling inconsistencies become immediately apparent .",
    "the first implicit assumption is that the measuring apparatus does not play a role in the theory .",
    "that is , when calculating the various effects caused by the interaction of gravity with mattersuch as , say , the scattering cross section of gwsone does not have to explicitly include the measuring apparatus .",
    "this assumption is certainly true for all the other forces of nature ; the existence of opposite or canceling `` charges '' for the em , weak , and strong forces ensures that one can , in principle , screen out these forces , thereby making the measuring apparatus unaffected by them .",
    "this is _ not _ true for gravity , however ; one can not screen out the gravitational force .",
    "why , then , should one _ not _ include the measuring apparatus explicitly in the construction of qg or of qfcs ?",
    "indeed , we shall show here that one _ must _ include the effects of gravitation on the apparatus in order to obtain physically correct results .",
    "one may argue that the scattering processes considered in quantum gravity occurs at very short length scalesthe planck lengthand the presence of any measuring apparatus will have a negligibly small effect .",
    "however , we would expect from the correspondence principle that classical gravity results could be obtainedin some limitfrom the quantum theory ; indeed , the construction of qg @xcite makes explicit use of the classical theory . and",
    "in classical gr it is well known that the inclusion of the measuring apparatusalong with the observeris crucial to understanding the dynamics of certain time - varying general relativistic systems involving tidal forces .",
    "consider , for example , an isolated observer and a classical test particle initially at rest some distance away from him . while both the observer and the particle do not move spatially with respect to one another , they are both physical objects that move along their respective geodesics .",
    "if a gw now passes through the system , _ tidal _ forces will of course shift the position and the velocity of the particle .",
    "however , these same tidal forces will _ also _ shift the position and the velocity of the observer ; the observer can not be isolated from the effective tidal forces caused by the gw .",
    "thus , the observer can not measure the motion of the particle independently of his own motion ; he can only measure the _ relative _ motion of the particle with respect to himself .",
    "for gws in the long - wavelength limit , the particle appears to the observer to undergo geodesic _ deviation _ motion [ eq .",
    "( 35.12 ) of @xcite ] , and not geodesic motion as one might first expect .",
    "indeed , a simple derivation of the geodesic deviation equation in this limit is to take the geodesic equation for the observer , subtract from it the geodesic equation of the particle , and expand the result in the distance separating the two geodesics .",
    "based on this simple example we would expect that any physically measurable response of matter to the scattering of gws calculated by using either qg or qfcs should include the effect of the gw on the observer . by extension",
    ", we would expect that in order to be consistent with classical gr , the construction of qg or qfcs should explicitly include the observer and his measurement apparatus from the very beginning .",
    "it may also be argued that , as with the other forces , explicit inclusion of an observer would be formally correct , but not required ; the lack of its inclusion would not materially affect any calculation .",
    "this argument would also be in conflict with general relativity , however .",
    "consider once again the simple system described above .",
    "when the geodesic deviation equations of motion are solved , one finds that the observed _ tidal _ response of the test particle to the passage of the long - wavelength gw is proportional to the distance separating the observer from the test particle ; as long as the long - wavelength approximation holds , the further away the particle is from the observer , the larger its response to the gw .",
    "this ubiquitous response of classical matter to the passage of a gw is exploited in various gw detectors such as the weber bar and ligo ( _ _ l__aser _ _ i__nterferometry _ _ g__ravitational - wave _",
    "_ o__bservatory ) ; the larger the detector , the larger its response to the passage of a gw",
    ". the characteristic size @xmath5 of the detector _ does _ play a role in the response of the system to the gw .",
    "suppose that either qg or qfcs is used to calculate the response of a weber bar or ligo to passage of a gw through the system",
    ". it would be natural to use the complex scalar field @xmath6 to describe the system . using the standard approach outlined above ,",
    "it is straightforward to see that to lowest order , the coupling between a gw propagating in minkowski spacetime with @xmath6 is @xmath7 . even in the long - wavelength limit",
    ", this interaction term does not explicitly depend on the size of the system .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to see how such size dependence can be generated by this term .",
    "the second implicit assumption made in @xcite and @xcite is that one can always find a global time axisand thereby construct a global coordinate systemin the curved spacetime .",
    "this is certainly possible for flat minkowski spacetime , which is often used as the background spacetime .",
    "it is also possible for the asymptotically flat manifold that dewitt considers in @xcite .",
    "however , we know from classical gr that it is not possible to find a coordinate system with a _ global _ time axis in general .",
    "the minkowski spacetime and the asymptotically flat spacetimesalong with the various black hole spacetimesare _ stationary _ spacetimes . in these spacetimes",
    "one can always choose a frame where the metric does not depend explicitly on the time coordinate .",
    "consequently , one can always construct a _",
    "timelike killing vector , which can be used by all observers in the spacetime as their time axis ( except , perhaps , at the event horizon or at an essential singularity ) .",
    "this killing vector can then be used to construct what dewitt termed the `` preferred frame '' , or as hawking and ellis termed it , a `` special frame '' @xcite that all observers in that spacetime can agree to use .",
    "timelike killing vectorsand global framesdo not exist in general , however .",
    "importantly , they do not exist in the presence of a gw . instead , each observer must choose his own local proper time axis , and construct his own local proper coordinate system from it .",
    "consequently , one can only measure the _ relative _ motion between observers .",
    "this is the underlying physical reason why , in the example given above , one ends up with the geodesic _ deviation _ equation of motion @xcite in the long - wavelength limit for gws , instead of the geodesic equation of motion .    although the above point is made very elegantly in the beginning of chap .  4 of @xcite for _ classical _",
    "gr , it is relevant on the quantum level as well . as pointed out in both chap .  3 of @xcite and chap .",
    "3 of @xcite , the construction of fock spaces for quantum fields in a curved spacetime is frame dependent ; different choices of coordinates result in unitarily _ inequivalent _ hilbert spaces .",
    "thus , only for such spacetimes as the stationary and de sitter spacetimes ( considered also by dewitt in @xcite ) , where there is a `` preferred frame '' , will it be possible for all observers to agree on what constitutes a particle state .",
    "it does not exist in general ( see @xcite for a discussion of the relevance of the concept of `` particles '' in general spacetimes )",
    ".    as dissimilar as the two above implicit assumptions may be appear to be on the surface , they are nonetheless intimately connected .",
    "the experimental measurement of _ any _ physical quantity requires an _ operational _ choice of origin , and a _ local _ orthogonal ( tetrad ) coordinate system . as any measurement is done through a physical apparatus ,",
    "this mathematical choice of coordinate systems is fixed on a real physical object .",
    "the inclusion of the observer in the theory is thus equivalent to a choice of local coordinates ; a choice of local coordinates must be equivalent to the inclusion of the physical observer .",
    "although we have pointed out in the above a number of inconsistencies between results from classical gr on the one hand , and qg and qfcs on the other , the goal of this paper is _ not _ to present a reformulation of either qg or qfcs ; we leave that task to future research .",
    "we instead address the issues raised by the two assumptions in the above by focusing on the dynamics of a much simpler system : the nonrelativistic , classical test particle in weak gravity . as simple as this system may be , especially when compared to the counterexamples we have listed above , many of the issues that we have raised above appear here as well .",
    "fundamentally , what is at issue here is the appropriate choice of coordinates ; this is an inherent aspect of classical gr , and is not due to a subtlety in the quantum theory .",
    "an analysis based on the dynamics of classical test particles has the added advantage of having limiting cases that have either been experimentally verified , or are in the process of being verified . in one limit ,",
    "the etvs experiment , the advancement of the perihelion of mercury , the deflection of light by the sun , and the gravitational redshift are all calculable within the usual dynamics of test particles in stationary spacetimes based on the geodesic equation . in the other limit , the response of weber bars and ligo to the passage of gws is calculable within the dynamics of test particles based on the geodesic _ deviation _ equation @xcite .",
    "the result of the analysis in this paper _ must _ agree with these two limits ; this serves as a stringent test of the validity of the approach we have taken and the coordinate system we have constructed .    in the literature",
    "most analyses of the dynamics of test particles in curved spacetime are done in the same vein as the construction of qg and qft in curved spacetimes , and are a direct generalization of the usual techniques for deriving hamiltonians from lagrangians for particles in flat spacetimes .",
    "one starts with the usual _ geodesic _ action for the test particle moving in an arbitrary curved spacetime with a given metric @xmath1 .",
    "time reparametization invariance of the action is broken either by choosing an explicit time coordinate , or by introducing a mass - shell constraint ( by hand or through a lagrange multiplier ) .",
    "choosing @xmath8 as the general coordinate , the canonical momentum @xmath9 is calculated from the lagrangian . the hamiltonian @xmath10 ( @xmath11 for `` standard formalism '' )",
    "is then constructed from this @xmath9 and the lagrangian in the usual way .",
    "an analysis similar to this was followed by dewitt in his 1957 paper @xcite , albeit in much more detail , and in 1966 he applied the nonrelativistic limit of @xmath10 for charged test particles to the analysis of the behavior of superconductors in the earth s lense - thirring field @xcite .",
    "it would seem that all we would have to do is to take the nonrelativistic limit of @xmath10 .",
    "however , the form of @xmath10 is dramatically different from the hamiltonian for test particle motion derived in @xcite based on the geodesic _ deviation _ equations of motion . as with the case of qg and",
    "qfcs the same troubling questions come to the fore at this point : where is the observer ?",
    "what are physical quantities such as the position @xmath12 and velocity @xmath13 of the particle measured with respect to ?",
    "what frame has been implicitly chosen by this analysis ?",
    "is this frame physical ?",
    "we know from the observertest - particle example given above that these are not fatuous questions .",
    "rather , they directly address the underlying physics .",
    "it is certainly true that in some specific casessuch as the presence of a weak gw in the systemone can treat the time - varying part of the metric as a perturbation of one of the known stationary metrics ; this time - varying piece would then be reflected as a perturbation on the killing vector .",
    "one could then use the usual coordinate system for these spacetimesaugmented by the inclusion of the observer and his coordinate systemand calculate @xmath10 in the usual way .",
    "doing so will not elucidate the underlying physics , however , and it is difficult to see how the geodesic _ deviation _ equations of motion arises in this approach .    the approach we shall take instead in studying the dynamics of nonrelativistic test particles in the linearized gravity limit will be to construct a general coordinate system that builds in the essential physics from the very beginning .",
    "since _ relative _ measurements between the observer and the particle always make physical sense , they are used as the foundation of our construction ; the special case of stationary metrics will naturally be included .",
    "specifically , we follow the considerations of @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite in connection with the coordinate system used in the analysis of ligo ) : every physical particle travels along a worldline @xmath14 with tangent vector @xmath15 ( which does not need to be a geodesic ) in the spacetime manifold @xmath16 .",
    "every measurement of the physical properties of the test particle by an observer must be done using an experimental apparatus .",
    "the observeralong with his apparatusmust propagate along his own worldline @xmath17 with tangent vector @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , every physical measurement of the particle is done _ relative _ to the motion of an observer . in particular , in measuring the position of the particle , one measures the distance _ separating _ @xmath14 and @xmath17 ; in measuring the @xmath19-velocity of the particle one measures of the _ relative _ velocity of the particle with respect to the observer @xcite .",
    "implementation of the above considerations proceeds quite naturally .",
    "as the observer prepares to take measurements on the test particle , he first chooses a local orthonormal coordinate system . in curved spacetimes",
    ", this involves the construction of a local tetrad frame @xcite .",
    "naturally , this coordinate system will be fixed , say , to the center of mass of his experimental apparatus , and will thus propagate in time along the worldline @xmath17 as well .",
    "the observer uses the coordinate time of the physical apparatus to measure time , which , because he will not be moving relative to the apparatus , is also his proper time .",
    "thus the time axis of the coordinate system he has chosen will always lie tangentially to @xmath17 .",
    "the positionwhich can be of finite extentof the test particle is measured with respect to an origin fixed on the apparatus , and is the shortest distance between this origin and the particle . however , because the apparatus travels along its worldline , the origin of the coordinate system will also travel along a worldline in @xmath16 . later , when the rate of change of the position of the particle is measured at two successive times , the _ relative _ @xmath19-velocity of the particle with respect to the apparatus will naturally be obtained .",
    "thus , the observer constructs his usual laboratory frame that extends across his experimental apparatus , but now incorporating the nontrivial local curvature of @xmath16 .",
    "we call this frame the general laboratory frame ( glf ) .",
    "local coordinate systems fixed to an observer have been constructed before .",
    "the fermi normal coordinates ( fnc ) were constructed in the 1920 s by fermi @xcite , and the fermi walker coordinates ( fwc ) were constructed in @xcite . while an observer can use either set of coordinates , both make assumptions and approximations that drastically limit their usefulness .",
    "the fnca direct implementation of the equivalence principleare constructed so that the levi - civita connection @xmath20 vanishes identically along the worldline of the observer ; only when one moves off the worldline does the curvature dependent terms begin to appear @xcite . for the fwc ,",
    "the restrictions on @xmath20 are somewhat relaxed , but certain components of @xmath20such as @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are spatial indicesstill vanish along the worldline . once again ,",
    "when one moves off the worldline curvature terms appear in the form of the riemann tensor and its derivatives . in both",
    ", one effectively makes a derivative expansion in the riemann curvature tensor @xcite .    in both fnc and fwc systems , choices for the value of @xmath20a gauge choicehave",
    "been made , and in both systems such gauge choices are inconsistent with the usual transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge for gws . while it is possible to study the interaction of gws with test particles in these coordinate systems ( see @xcite for fnc and @xcite for fwc ) ,",
    "doing so is cumbersome .",
    "for example , it has only recently been established that the tt gauge for gws is compatible with the fnc @xcite , but only in the long wavelength limit ; the two are incompatible when the wavelength becomes smaller than the size of the experimental apparatus . in our construction of the glf ,",
    "no such restrictions on @xmath20 are made within the linearized gravity approximation .",
    "thus , when we consider the case of gws interacting with nonrelativistic particles , the tt gaugeor any other gaugecan be directly taken .",
    "moreover , we do not make any restrictions on how rapidly the riemann curvature tensor varies , and therefore are not restricted to only the long - wavelength limit .",
    "this enables us to study the effects of arbitrary - wavelength gws on the motion of nonrelativistic test particles in large systems .",
    "it is here in our study of test particle dynamics that we obtain our most surprising result : even though the underlying gw is a spin-@xmath24 tensor field , in the weak gravity , slow velocity limit , the gw acts on the particle through a local velocity field @xmath0 .",
    "this velocity fieldwhich is an integral of the ricci rotation coefficientscouples to the test particle as though it was a vector potential for a spin-@xmath25 _ vector _ field ( see also @xcite for the additional terms that the ricci rotation coefficients introduce in fermionic condensed matter systems and their implications ) , and its origin is the _ tidal _ nature of the forces that the gw induces on the test particle .",
    "it has the same properties as a vector potential : like the vector potential for the em field @xmath26 , @xmath0 is a transverse field satisfying the wave equation .",
    "it is a frame - dependent field with the local galilean group as its gauge group .",
    "effective `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields can be constructed from @xmath0 in the usual way , and they are solutions to a set of partial differential equations that have the same form as the maxwell equations since they are directly related to the electric and magnetic parts of the weyl tensor , and thus to components of the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "the equations of motion for the nonrelativistic particle have the form of a lorentz force with the mass of the particle playing the role of the charge .",
    "as required , these equations reduce to the usual geodesic deviation equations @xcite in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we construct explicitly the glf and its coordinates using a tetrad frame fixed to the worldline of the observer .",
    "the velocity of a test particle in the glf is derived in the nonrelativistic limit . in sec .",
    "iii we use these velocities to construct the action , and then the hamiltonian for the test particle in the glf .",
    "we show that for stationary @xmath16 this hamiltonian reduces to dewitt s hamiltonian , and for long - wavelength tt gws propagating in a flat background it reduces to the hamiltonian @xcite derived from the geodesic equations of motion . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the properties of the velocity field @xmath0 introduced in sec .  3 for arbitrary gws , and construct effective electric and magnetic fields from it .",
    "these fields are shown to obey equations that have the same form as maxwell s equations , and they are used to derive the equations of motion for a test particle . an aharonov - bohm - type interference effect for quantum test particles that is shown to follow from the effective vector potential @xmath0 can be found in sec .",
    "v along with other concluding remarks . in appendix",
    "a we present a brief review of the tetrad and linearized gravity formalisms , while in appendix b , we derive the nonintegrable phase factor @xmath27 for the gravitational aharonov - bohm - type interference effect .",
    "as usual , @xmath28 is the metric on the curved spacetime manifold @xmath16 with a signature @xmath29 .",
    "greek indices run from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , and they denote the coordinates @xmath8 for a general coordinate system on @xmath16 .",
    "we will , however , be working primarily in one specific tetrad frame , and we will use capital roman letters running from @xmath30 to @xmath31 for the spacetime indices in this frame .",
    "( a summary of well - known results for linearized gravity and tetrad frames is given in appendix a. ) we reserve lowercase roman letters running from @xmath25 to @xmath31 for spatial indices in the tetrad frame , and careted lowercase roman letters for spatial indices in the general coordinate frame .",
    "a worldline with a timelike tangent vector @xmath18 parameterized by @xmath32 is denoted as @xmath17 ; this worldline needs not be a geodesic .",
    "spacelike geodesics , with tangent vectors @xmath33 and parameterized by its arclength @xmath34 , are denoted by @xmath35 , and null geodesics with tangent vectors @xmath36 parameterized by its arclength @xmath37 are denoted by @xmath38 .    the construction of the glf for the observerbeing a specific choice of general tetrad frames that is fixed onto the worldline of the observeris fairly standard .",
    "it must , however , be done without knowing the specific form of the underlying metric of @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , the local metric at any given time is _ determined _ by making local measurements .",
    "we are aided in this construction by three observations .",
    "first and foremost , we note that the observer does not need a coordinate system that is nonsingular over _ all _ of @xmath16 ; such a coordinate system is known not to exist in general .",
    "all that is needed is a coordinate system that is nonsingular within the region of @xmath16 where the observer makes experimental measurements .",
    "second , we are working in the linearized gravity limit .",
    "this assures that we do not have to concern ourselves with coordinate singularities , and we can take curvature effects as perturbations on the flat spacetime metric .",
    "finally , we are primarily interested in the effect of linearized gravity on _ nonrelativistic _ test particles ; in this limit , incorporation of causality effects in the construction of the glf simplifies dramatically .",
    "let us consider an observer @xmath39 with worldline @xmath17 . to perform experimental measurements at some time @xmath40",
    ", @xmath39 constructs a local orthogonal coordinate system centered on his experimental apparatus by choosing a tetrad frame @xmath41 , a set of orthogonal unit vectors such that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the usual minkowski metric and @xmath44 is the metric for @xmath16 at @xmath45 .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , observer - based coordinates have been constructed before @xcite , @xcite , although they were not explicitly constructed in a tetrad frame .",
    "although the fnc and fwc are constructed using a series of approximations that make them unsuitable for our purposes , a number of the fundamental concepts used in their construction nevertheless carry over to our construction .",

    "it is when we consider nonstationary spacetimessuch as those where gws play a dominant role in determining the physicsthat we must take care to explicitly include the observer and his experimental apparatus in the analysis .",
    "traditionally , there is an almost linear progression of approximations , such as the hierarchy sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig-7]a , that we usually associated with gr . within full gr we can make the linearized gravity approximation , which is thought to be inclusive of both the parametrized - post - newtonian @xcite ( stationary ) and the gw ( nonstationary ) limits ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
