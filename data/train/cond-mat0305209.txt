    "there has been great progress in the theory of crossing potentials during the last seven decades ( see e.g. the references in both research and textbook literature @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , seemingly a simple but a basic question how well known semiclassical quantization rules should be modified for this particular situation ( crossing diabatic potentials with bound ( i.e. localized ) initial and localized or delocalized final states ) to the best of our knowledge are still unanswered , ( at least a complete and unifying description of the quantization for a general case is still not available and a number of other questions remain to be clarified ) .",
    "partially it is related to the fact that unfortunately experimental data in this field are still scarce and not very accurate .",
    "however , the situation is now changing .",
    "experimental techniques ( e.g. , the increasing precision of experimental tests in the femtosecond laser pulse range enables to excite well defined molecular states and to study their evolution in time using the second probing laser beam @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have progressed to the point where molecular tunneling splitting dependence on energy can be measured in well controlled conditions with a very high accuracy .",
    "it would therefore seem appropriate at this time to take a fresh look at the theory , which is the purpose of the present article .",
    "note also that these questions are not only of interest in their own intellectual right .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical advances @xcite , @xcite in particular are beginning to yield a coherent understanding of several phenomena that , far from requiring minor corrections to the standard adiabatic treatment of the problem .",
    "physically such kind of situations can occur as a result of non - adiabatic interactions of different electronic states forming in crossing one - well diabatic vibrational potentials .",
    "adiabatic coupling removes diabatic level crossing , and the diabatic levels are replaced by the adiabatic ones ( see fig.1 illustrating this phenomenon ) . in the case of a large adiabatic splitting ( see precise criteria below ) one can restrict oneself to the only lower adiabatic potential ( symmetric or asymmetric double - well , or decay potential for the systems under consideration ) and neglect any influence of the upper adiabatic potential ( parabolic one - well for our case ) .",
    "however , in a general case of arbitrary adiabatic splittings , intra - well and inter - wells dynamics depends on the both adiabatic potentials ( i.e. on tunneling and adiabatic splitting ) .",
    "having in mind applications , the studies of these questions may concern the various molecular systems undergoing so - called conversion of electronic states , isomerization reactions , or radiationless transitions arising from  intersystem  crossings of potential energy surfaces in molecular spectroscopy and chemical dynamics , or inelastic atomic collisions .",
    "it is worth noting that there exists a huge literature devoted to different approaches have been made by other authors to the problem of crossing diabatic potentials ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite - @xcite , @xcite - @xcite ) but some important differences to our work should be noted .",
    "first , suffice it to say , that the problem how diabatic potentials crossing modifies the adiabatic potentials ( occurring as a result of this crossing ) quantization rules , has not been investigated at all .",
    "one of the reason is that for many say standard rigid molecules with quite large adiabatic splitting of energy levels , one may safely neglect any influence of the upper adiabatic potential ( i.e. to use the standard quantization rules ) .",
    "however , nowadays the increasing precision of experimental tests of molecular tunneling splitting and decay ( and besides investigations and synthesis of more and more new non - rigid molecules ) , makes the study of this problem relevant and actual .",
    "second , is a methodic note .",
    "all previous approaches were based on the general semiclassical wkb formalism .",
    "the crucial point to treat quantization for crossing diabatic potentials is how to compute the contribution coming from the contour around a complex turning point .",
    "the accuracy of the wkb method can be improved considerably , @xcite - @xcite ( more recent references on so - called laplace contour integration can be found also in @xcite , @xcite ) by the appropriate choice of the integration path around the turning point .",
    "this method ascending to landau @xcite appears to be quite accurate for the tunneling and over - barrier regions , ( however , even in this case there are some non - negligible corrections found in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but in the intermediate energy region ( where there are relevant contributions from all four quantum states occurring at the crossing diabatic potentials ) the method becomes completely non - adequate . besides the choice of these additional special trajectories ( which one has to include to improve the accuracy of the wkb method , and along which the semiclassical motion is described by the weber functions ) depends on the detail form of the potential far from the top , and therefore for each particular case the non - universal procedure should be perform from the very beginning .",
    "the essential simplification of the procedure can be achieved using the standard wkb semiclassical approximation in the momentum space representation was also proposed in the literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the method works well to compute the lz transition probability , however , the application of this approach to the level quantization problem is difficult to realize .",
    "indeed the problem requires to know the eigenfunctions in the coordinate space , and one can not bluntly use the fourier transform of the functions found in the momentum space , since the wkb method gives us only asymptotics of the eigenfunctions .",
    "these say drawbacks of the wkb - like methods did not allow to study level quantization for crossing diabatic potentials in the previous investigations , and , besides , we believe we are the first to explicitely addresses the question on the behavior in the intermediate energy region . in all previous publications this region was considered as a very narrow and insignificant one , or in the best case the results were obtained by a simple interpolation from the tunneling ( with monotonic decay of the transition probability ) to the over - barrier ( with oscillating behavior ) regions .",
    "recently we have shown @xcite that semiclassical solutions of many eigenvalue problems can be considerably simplified by including into the consideration second order turning points .",
    "the fact is that one second order turning point replaces two close linear turning points .",
    "moreover it turns out ( see below ) that connection matrices which link on the complex plane the solutions to the schrdinger equation in the vicinity of the the crossing point with the asymptotic solutions far from this point , can be calculated from the solutions of the weber equation .",
    "increasing and decreasing solutions in the classically forbidden region around a second order turning point , are characterized by the action which has a minimum along a certain trajectory , we will refer in what follows as the instanton trajectory .",
    "the same kind of the weber equation can be formulated to calculate the connection matrices in the vicinity of a saddle point ( or a maximum ) of the potential , but besides we should also relate increasing and decreasing solutions at the crossing point ( see also our recent publications on lz crossing phenomena @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to construct semiclassical wave functions . to do it we use connection matrix methodology which can be applied to any semiclassical approximation , but details of the method",
    "depends on the order of the turning points . for the second order turning points which are minima of a potential , the whole procedure is equivalent to the traditional instanton approach , and the imaginary time ( i.e. after wick rotation ) instanton trajectories correspond to the periodic orbits between the turning points , and the connection matrices in this case ( see below and appendix [ a ] to the paper ) are real - valued ones .",
    "it is not the case for the second order turning point which is the potential maximum .",
    "the complex - valued connection matrix links two regions of infinite motion .",
    "formally one might refer the corresponding wave functions also as instanton ones applying twice the wick rotations .",
    "lz crossing points are combinations of two second order turning points with two different stokes constants @xcite corresponding to one minimum and one maximum of the potential . in the tunneling region there exist periodic orbits for two solutions while two others correspond to unrestricted ( infinite ) motions . as above we will call these wave functions as instanton ones since they are weber functions ( like in the traditional instanton method ) but with complex - valued arguments occurring as a result of complex coordinate frame rotation .",
    "thus our approach in this paper is based on the minimization of the functional of classical action in the upside - down potential , so - called instanton type approach , which represents the most important area of the configurational space where the semiclassical wave functions are localized ( see @xcite , @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "the whole analysis can be brought into a more elegant form by introducing connection matrices which link on the complex plane the semiclassical solutions to the schrdinger equation for the model potential of the problem under study and the exact solutions of the so - called comparison equation which is valid near the crossing point , where one can approximate the potential by linear or parabolic ones .",
    "the explicit calculations of the connection matrices are rather involved since one should treat the four fundamental solutions to the left and to the right regions with respect to turning or crossing points .",
    "therefore the connection matrices , we are looking for , are @xmath0 matrices .",
    "although the generalization for our case of the known already @xmath1 connection matrices ( see e.g. , @xcite ) is straightforward , it deserves some precaution as it implies quite different procedures for the energy ( more accurately for @xmath2 were @xmath3 is the semiclassical parameter , see below ) smaller ( the tunneling region ) , larger ( the over - barrier region ) , or of the order ( the intermediate region ) of the potential barrier energy . within the framework of the connection matrix approach we present a full and unified description of @xmath4 ( which is very often",
    "can be quite reasonable approximation for real systems ) level quantization problem for diabatic potentials crossing .",
    "the remainder of our paper has the following structure .",
    "section [ bas ] contains basic methodical details and equations necessary for our investigation . except for a mathematical trick that eliminates a large amount of tedious algebra and allows us to construct a regular method for calculating higher order perturbative corrections , the section contains already known results .",
    "new physical results are collected in sections [ res ] , [ inter ] and [ bath ] , and partially in section [ mat ] , where we calculate all needed connection matrices , which provide a very efficient method of finding semiclassical solutions to the schrodinger equation in potentials having several turning points .",
    "the knowledge of the connection matrices is important and significant not only in itself but also for developing a good analytical approximation , and standardized numerical procedures . in section [ res ]",
    "we find the quantization rules for the tunneling and over - barrier energy regions .",
    "section [ inter ] is devoted to the intermediate energy region where all four states occurring at the diabatic potentials crossing should be regarded on the same footing .",
    "different particular cases , depending on the ratio of the model parameters are also examined in this section . in section [ bath ]",
    "we investigate the linear coupling of the lz system to harmonic phonons and find that it renormalizes of the parameters entering the initial diabatic potentials crossing problems considered in the previous sections [ res ] - [ inter ] .",
    "the last section [ discus ] contains summary and discussion . in two appendices to the paper we collect some more specialized technical material required for the calculations connection matrices in different energy windows ( appendix a ) , and to reduce fourth order schrdinger equation to two independent second order weber equations ( appendix b ) .",
    "those readers who are not very interested in mathematical derivations can skip these appendices finding all essential physical results in the main text of the paper .",
    "to move further on smoothly let us describe first our strategy .",
    "first we should define all notations and relevant points of the diabatic potentials crossing problem .",
    "we depicted the typical situation in the vicinity of the diabatic potentials crossing point in fig .",
    "the diabatic potentials ( 1,2 ) are shown by thin solid lines , the adiabatic potentials ( 3,4 ) by bold solid lines . besides we have introduced in the picture the adiabatic coupling energy @xmath5 , the crossing point energy @xmath6 , and",
    "@xmath7 is the characteristic zero - point oscillations energy in the parabolic barrier approximated the lower adiabatic potential near its top .    as a model for diabatic potentials in this paper",
    "we choose two parabola @xmath8 , @xmath9 with a symmetrical crossing in the point @xmath10 . to be specific : let us consider two types of the diabatic potential crossing depicted in the fig .",
    "the corresponding adiabatic potentials are , respectively , the double well or decay lower potential , and the one - well upper adiabatic potential . at arbitrary values of the parameter @xmath5 to find eigenstates and eigenfunctions for our model potential we should solve the coupled schrdinger equations @xmath11 here @xmath3 is the semiclassical parameter which is determined by the ratio of the characteristic potential scale over the zero oscillation energy ( i.e. @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a mass of a particle , @xmath14 is a characteristic length of the problem , e.g. the tunneling distance , @xmath15 is a characteristic frequency , e.g. the oscillation frequency around the potential minimum ) .    these equations ( [ nn3 ] ) can be written as one fourth order equation , e.g. for @xmath16 @xmath17 \\theta _",
    "l = 0   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in what follows we use @xmath15 and @xmath14 to set corresponding dimensionless scales , e.g dimensionless energy @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( we introduce factor 2 in @xmath21 for ease of writing following below equations ) , coordinate @xmath22 , and we put @xmath23 ( except where explicitely stated to the contrary and the occurrences of @xmath24 are necessary for understanding ) .    luckily the equation ( [ nn4 ] ) admits semiclassical solutions by fedoryuk method @xcite - @xcite since the coefficients at the @xmath25-th order derivatives proportional to @xmath26 , and therefore so small that higher order derivatives of the prefactor ( in the semiclassical form the wave function can be always presented as the prefactor times the exponent ) can be safely neglected in finding of asymptotic solutions .",
    "fedoryuk method makes possible to find asymptotic solutions to the ordinary differential equations of the following form @xmath27 where we designated @xmath28 , and the coefficients at the derivatives @xmath29 are arbitrary functions of @xmath30 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ nn4 ] ) for @xmath31 has this fedoryuk form . by the standard semiclassical substitution @xmath32 ( [ f1 ] )",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the subscripts in ( [ b6 ] ) corresponds to the upper or lower adiabatic levels , and the superscripts are referred to the sign of the action .",
    "as it was mentioned above in the vicinity of the crossing point one can replace ( [ nn4 ] ) by ( [ nn7 ] ) , and by the substitution @xmath52 we can find the equation for @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 it can be proved that the 4-th order equation ( [ nn7 ] ) in variables ( [ nn11 ] ) is reduced to the equation with constant coefficients in front of all derivatives and with the free term in the form of a quadratic over @xmath30 function . in the case when the exponent in ( [ nn11 ] ) is a solution to the equation ( [ b8])the transformed equation is reduced to the weber equations upon neglecting anharmonic terms like @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "we presented all details of this reduction in appendix [ b ] to the paper .",
    "thus the equation ( [ nn7 ] ) is reduced to two independent weber equations with the known fundamental solutions @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is so - called massey parameter .",
    "the corrections to the indices of the parabolic cylinder functions @xmath63 and to the arguments of these functions can be found from ( [ b8 ] ) .",
    "presented above the leading terms of these solutions corresponding to the tunneling case , i.e. ( here we use a dimensional energy @xmath64 ) @xmath65 ( in our dimensionless units it is @xmath66 ) , where the characteristic fourth order polynomial ( [ nn8 ] ) can be reduced to the second order one ( i.e. two pairs of roots are nearly degenerated ) , are known in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite - @xcite ) but the fedoryuk method we used , gives us also in the tunneling region the higher order over the parameter @xmath67 ( [ b9 ] ) corrections .    in the tunneling region ( [ j1 ] )",
    "one can expand the roots of ( [ b8 ] ) in terms of the parameter @xmath67 ( [ b9 ] ) . using the substitution ( [ nn11 ] ) to transform ( [ nn4 ] ) we can find easily that at the conditions ( [ b8 ] ) , ( [ b9 ] ) the coefficients at the fourth and at the third order derivatives in the transformed fourth order differential equation for @xmath68 are small ( proportional to @xmath67 and to @xmath69 respectively ) and thus this fourth order equation can be rewritten as two second order weber equations with the solutions @xmath70 where @xmath71    the same manner in the over - barrier energy region i.e. @xmath72 ( again as in ( [ j1 ] ) we have used dimensional units , and in dimensionless form ( [ j2 ] ) reads as @xmath73 ) , when the energy is larger than the upper adiabatic potential minimum , the roots of the equation ( [ nn8 ] ) are complex - conjugated and having the same structure as presented above ( see also ( [ apen6 ] ) in the appendix [ b ] ) for the tunneling region with the roots @xmath53 given @xmath74 besides in ( [ apen6 ] ) @xmath75 and with @xmath76 playing the role of the small parameter in this region @xmath77 again as above for the tunneling region , the coefficients at the higher order derivatives are small , and therefore , the function @xmath68 ( [ nn11 ] ) satisfies the weber equation with the fundamental solutions @xmath78 where @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is defined as the massey parameter entering ( [ nn13 ] ) with @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 ) .",
    "like it was for the tunneling region ( [ b11 ] ) , the leading terms of the expansion ( [ b14 ] ) coincide with the well - known results , but from ( [ b14 ] ) we are able to compute the corrections to the main terms .    the analogous task for the intermediate energy region , i.e. ( in dimensional units ) @xmath83 is much more tricky .",
    "our results will be presented in section [ inter ] , but a few comments are necessary here . in the problem we have three dimensionless parameters characterizing the energy ( @xmath84 ) , the level coupling ( @xmath21 ) , and the potential ( @xmath85 ) , and besides for the ease of semiclassical estimations we keep also the semiclassical parameter @xmath3 . note also that these parameters are not independent ones , and the relation @xmath86 ( which we will be useful in our further consideration ) should be satisfied . in terms of these parameters within the intermediate energy region ( [ j3 ] ) , we have the subregion , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , and the intermediate subregion , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 . in the section [ inter ]",
    "we calculate the connection matrices for the both subregions , and details of the reduction procedures , which are different in @xmath87 ( where the comparison equations are reduced to two decoupled airy equations ) and @xmath90 ( where these comparisons equations are weber ones ) are described in the appendix [ b ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to briefly indicate the main steps in the derivation connection matrices .",
    "the matching points we must find to quantize the energy levels depend essentially on the energy window under consideration ( [ j1 ] ) , ( [ j2 ] ) , ( [ j3 ] ) . the tunneling region is placed in the lower adiabatic potential . in the wkb method in this case starting from the crossing point ( @xmath38 )",
    "one has to investigate the classically forbidden region in the lower adiabatic potential barrier ( see fig . 3a and the corresponding figure caption for all notations ) .",
    "the solutions can be found easily in the vicinity to the crossing point but to derive the quantization rules one should know also the solutions quite far from the crossing point . to do it explicitely in the wkb method we should match the two exponentially decreasing and two exponentially increasing solutions in the barrier with the oscillation solutions in the wells .",
    "technically the matching should be performed asymptotically , i.e. at small @xmath92 but for large enough @xmath93 . to do it",
    "one has to calculate all needed connection matrices ( namely at the crossing point , and at the linear and second order turning points , and the shift matrices from the crossing point to the turning points in the classically forbidden region and between the turning points in the classically accessible region ) . within the instanton type method the trajectory goes through only the classically forbidden region ( see fig .",
    "3b ) , and matching should be performed only at two second order turning points . in the over - barrier energy region",
    "( see fig .",
    "4 ) , the matching is performed by using the crossing point connection matrix @xmath94 , the shift matrix @xmath95 connecting the crossing point and the linear turning points at the upper adiabatic potential , and the shift matrices @xmath96 belonging to the diabatic potentials . in this case",
    "all matching solutions are oscillating ones . finally for the intermediate energy region",
    "no real - valued turning points for the upper states ( see fig .",
    "5 ) and the matching between two oscillating and two exponentially varying solutions is determined by the connection matrix ( see fig .",
    "5 ) linking the linear imaginary turning points of the adiabatic potentials .    to recast the analysis into a compact form it is convenient to formulate the general procedure for calculating of the connection matrices for an arbitrary combinations of the first and of the second order turning points .",
    "after that the procedure can be applied to any particular problem under investigation . to do it , one has to extend the known for linear turning points procedure @xcite . for a generic semiclassical equation @xmath97 in the limit @xmath3 the stokes and anti - stokes lines are determined by the following conditions , respectively @xmath98 and @xmath99 where the action @xmath100 the lower integration limit in ( [ p2 ] ) is not relevant because we are interested in semiclassical solutions for large @xmath101 .",
    "these stokes and anti - stokes lines separate the complex plane @xmath102 into the sectors . on the anti - stokes lines the increasing and decreasing solutions become equal , and the type of the solutions is interchanged upon crossing of the anti - stokes lines .",
    "the stokes lines are bisectors between neighboring anti - stokes lines . after the crossing with the stokes line",
    ", one should add to the coefficient at the decreasing solution the coefficient at the increasing solution times so - called stokes constant .",
    "the latter one is occurred as a result of going around the turning point and depends on the turning point type .    to find the connection matrices for the tunneling region we have to establish the correspondence between the solutions of the fourth order differential equation ( [ nn4 ] ) and those for the localized in the left ( @xmath103 ) and in the right ( @xmath104 ) wells states . in the case @xmath105 for the diabatic potentials , the action can be computed starting from the both wells ( @xmath104 and @xmath103 ) @xmath106 where @xmath107 is imaginary momentum ( @xmath6 sets the energy corresponding to the diabatic potentials crossing point ) , and @xmath108 are the actions computed from an arbitrary distant point in the @xmath103 or in the @xmath104 wells , respectively to the point @xmath38 . from the other hand in the adiabatic potentials @xmath109 the corresponding actions can be represented @xmath110 explicitely comparing the semiclassical wave functions in the both representations ( adiabatic and diabatic ones ) it is easy to see that the adiabatic functions in the potential @xmath111 coincide with the diabatic functions for localized @xmath103 and @xmath104 states at @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "the adiabatic functions for the upper potential @xmath114 correspond to the tails of the diabatic wave functions localized in the opposite wells .",
    "therefore in the level crossing region the @xmath115 diabatic functions are transformed into the @xmath116 functions , and the interaction entangles the diabatic states with the same sign of @xmath117 .",
    "thus we have only four non - zero amplitudes of the following transitions @xmath118 recalling that @xmath119 we come to the conclusion that the quantum solutions ( [ b11 ] ) , valid in the vicinity of the level crossing point asymptotically , match smoothly increasing and decreasing solutions , and it leads to the landau description @xcite of the level crossing transitions . to illustrate the presented above analytical results we show schematically in fig .",

    "the @xmath131 and @xmath132 matrices are called shift matrices , and those are related to the variations of the coefficients of increasing and decaying semiclassical solutions in the regions between the turning points ( @xmath132 is the shift matrix when one moves from the crossing to the turning point in classically forbidden region , and @xmath131 are the shift matrices in the classically accessible regions ) .",

    "the crossing point is in the classically accessible region for the both potentials .",
    "the fundamental diabatic solutions can be represented as the waves propagating in the opposite directions , and the complex - valued connection matrix has as it was for the tunneling region @xmath1 block structure , where the blocks link the waves in the @xmath103 and in the @xmath104 wells propagating in the same direction .",

    "let us also stress that in real systems the characteristic values of the coupling between the diabatic states can vary within the very wide range from several @xmath299 for the electronic states of the same symmetry to zero ( for the states with different spins ) . to treat all these cases",
    "one should know the solution of the diabatic potentials crossing problem described in our paper for the corresponding wide range of the massey parameter from @xmath300 to @xmath301 .",

    "the efficency of the standard instanton approach @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) is based on a successful choice of the comparison equation near second order turning points , where asymptotically smooth matching of semiclassical solutions to the solutions of this equation should be performed .",
    "it is known for example @xcite that for anharmonic potentials the weber equation provides such a very successful choice since in the matching region anharmonic corrections are still small .",
    "the aim of this appendix is to show that the analogous situation holds for crossing diabatic potentials points , where two weber equations can be successfully used as the comparison equations to the fourth order landau - zener equation ( [ nn4 ] ) .",
    "the arguments and the indices of the fundamental solutions to these weber comparison equations are determined by the roots of the corresponding characteristic equations ( see below and the main body of the paper ) .    to prove the statement",
    "let us first substitute ( [ nn11 ] ) into the equation ( [ nn7 ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath306 @xmath307\\phi = 0   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath308 .",
    "the equation ( [ apen1 ] ) can be formally derived by simple manipulations ( two sequential differentiations and summations ) from the following second order equation @xmath309 where the coefficients are @xmath310 where @xmath53 should be found from the characteristic equation ( [ b8 ] ) , and @xmath67 is given by ( [ b9 ] ) .",
    "the fundamental solutions to ( [ apen2 ] ) read as @xmath311 \\",

    "thus from the given above expressions and ( [ b9 ] ) , ( [ b10 ] ) from the main text we conclude that the solutions @xmath316 ( [ nn13 ] ) can be expanded over our small parameter @xmath67 , and due to the condition ( [ b9 ] ) anharmonic corrections to the weber functions ( [ apen4 ] ) are small ( by other words the parameter @xmath67 determines the accuracy of our approximation ) .",
    "indeed the anharmonic terms neglected in the weber comparison equations are of the order of @xmath67 ( it is an upper estimation at @xmath317 , i.e. at the boundaries of the intermediate energy region ) , thus the corrections are small according to ( [ b9 ] ) .",
    "the same kind of analysis can be performed in the over - barrier region ( [ j2 ] ) , where one finds two imaginary largest modulus roots of the characteristic equation .",

    "one simple observation helps to perform the same analysis for the intermediate energy region ( [ j3 ] ) .",
    "indeed , since the differences between the solutions to the characteristic equations for @xmath319 ( [ b2 ] ) and for @xmath53 ( [ b8 ] ) determine the accuracy of our approach , let us compare the solutions .",
    "the roots of ( [ b2 ] ) at @xmath38 @xmath320 are moved upon the variation of @xmath84 in the intermediate energy region from the real to imaginary coordinate axis .",
    "analogously the roots of ( [ b8 ] ) @xmath321 are moved along the real and imaginary axis in the tunneling and in the over - barrier regions respectively .",
    "we conclude from the ( [ apen7 ] ) and ( [ apen8 ] ) that in the tunneling and in the over - barrier energy regions there is one - per - one correspondence between the roots @xmath319 of ( [ b2 ] ) and @xmath53 of ( [ b8 ] ) .",
    "just this correspondence allows us to match smoothly the semiclassical solutions to the schrdinger equation and the weber functions found as the solutions to the comparison equations .",
    "it is not the case in the intermediate energy region where two roots of ( [ b2 ] ) are real and two are imaginary ones having the same modulus , i.e. moving upon @xmath84 variation along a circle with the radius @xmath158 . in this case the semiclassical solutions can be presented as certain linear combinations of the comparison equation solutions .",
    "we have found these combinations in the adiabatic basis in the section [ inter ] . in this appendix",
    "we show how to solve the same problem in the diabatic basis , and it reveals more clearly and explicitely an estimate of the omitted terms in the equation and the areas where the solutions become wrong and where the matching procedure is carried out .",
    "indeed the roots of ( [ b8 ] ) in the intermediate energy region ( [ j3 ] ) are @xmath322 where @xmath323 correspondingly to these roots ( [ apen10 ] ) the arguments and the indices of the weber functions ( [ apen4 ] ) , ( [ apen5 ] ) read as @xmath324 @xmath325 and @xmath326 @xmath327 where @xmath328 , and @xmath329 .    using known due to olver ( @xcite , @xcite ) asymptotics of the weber functions we are in the position to compare the semiclassical functions with the solutions to the comparison equations .",
    "the former functions determine by the exponential factor @xmath330 while the exponential factors entering corresponding asymptotics of the weber functions are @xmath331 x^3 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us consider now the intermediate subregion @xmath87 , @xmath332 , and @xmath333 , ( see ( [ b22 ] ) ) , where ( [ b9 ] ) does not hold .",
    "luckily , however , the asymptotically smooth matching is performed at small @xmath297 , where the comparison equation ( [ apen2 ] ) , and , therefore , the characteristic equation ( [ b8 ] ) are valid ( although , @xmath67 is not a small parameter ) . in this subregion",
    "we have to take into consideration the term @xmath334 in ( [ b8 ] ) . at @xmath335 , and @xmath336 ,",
    "the characteristic equation has one double degenerate root @xmath337 , or correspondingly in ( [ apen2 ] ) , @xmath338 .",
    "thus the comparison equations are reduced to two decoupled airy equations . using known olver asymptotics for the weber functions with large arguments and indices @xcite , @xcite @xmath339 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can find asymptotics to the solutions of ( [ apen2 ] ) @xmath340 valid at arbitrary values of the parameters @xmath341 ( @xmath338 including ) .",
    "this relation ( [ apen16 ] ) provides asymptotically smooth matching of the semiclassical solutions with the weber functions in the intermediate subregion @xmath90 ( where @xmath53 is of the order of @xmath3 , and with the airy solutions in the subregion @xmath87 , when @xmath342 .",
    "this consideration provides the justification of our approach described in the main body of the paper . as it is seen from ( [ apen13 ] ) , and ( [ apen14 ] ) at small @xmath84",
    "the accuracy of the asymptotically smooth matching of the semiclassical solutions with the weber functions is of the order of @xmath296 , and close to the energetic boundaries ( [ j3 ] ) of the intermediate region , anharmonic corrections ( @xmath343 ) are increased .",
    "thus we conclude that the matching for this case ( [ j3 ] ) can be performed either in the adiabatic basis ( as it has been done in the section [ inter ] ) or in the diabatic basis as we have shown in this appendix . the simplest way to prove",
    "the equivalence of the both representation is to transform into exponential forms the factors like @xmath344 etc , entering the solutions ( [ b27 ] ) , ( [ b28 ] ) , found in the section [ inter ] . in the both methods the accuracy is of the order of @xmath296 , and the connection matrices presented in the appendix [ a ] do not depend on the basis .",
