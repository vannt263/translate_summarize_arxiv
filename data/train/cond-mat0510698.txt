    "in this paper , we study nonequilibrium transport in a class of 1-d hamiltonian systems consisting of free noninteracting point particles of mass @xmath0 moving inside a chain of identical cells , which are like `` chaotic billiards '' .",
    "each cell contains a device ( called a _ tank _ in @xcite ) that interacts with the particles by exchanging energy with them . even though the particles do not interact among themselves , an effective interaction is mediated by the tanks . as pointed out in previous studies",
    "@xcite , this mediated interaction among the particles allows such models to reach thermalization . these models are therefore genuine many - particle interacting hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , the details of the interaction between tanks and particles are not important . however , since our aim is to study model systems with realistic microscopic dynamics we shall ask that this interaction satisfies some general conditions : the system has to be time - reversible and hamiltonian , although conservation of phase space volume is seemingly enough .",
    "an earlier study , @xcite , went some ways in explaining the energy and particle profiles in terms of a stochastic approximation to a hamiltonian model .",
    "this class of models was derived , in turn , from work @xcite in which a lorentz gas with rotating discs was considered .    the stochastic approximation used in @xcite assumed that in their evolution , the particles exit on both sides of each cell with _",
    "equal _ probability at some fixed rate . out of equilibrium",
    ", the exit rates will change from cell to cell and this leads to the effective transport of particles and heat .",
    "it was found that , to lowest order , due to the gradient character @xcite of the system , the profiles for the rates at which particles and energy are transported among neighboring cells interpolate _",
    "linearly _ between the values imposed by the baths at the ends . from this ,",
    "energy and particle density along the chain were computed explicitly .",
    "they are generally not linear .",
    "the equal probability to jump to the left or to the right leads to a simple random walk process , without any memory effects .",
    "this assumption is strictly valid only when the cells are weakly coupled , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the size of the openings connecting neighbouring cells is very small . however , away from this limit case , the memory effects can not in general be neglected and the symmetry assumption is likely to fail .    in this paper , we study the consequences of including these dynamical memory effects .",
    "the price we pay for doing this is the lack of a simple stochastic formulation to describe the energy exchange from cell to cell . instead , at the steady state we propose a set of balance equations for the particle number and energy in each cell in terms of the reflection and transmission probabilities for particles and energy .",
    "we specify a phenomenological law for these probabilities that allows us to obtain an approximate expression for the steady state .",
    "our findings for the class of @xmath1-d hamiltonian chains that we consider can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we elaborate a phenomenological theory for the reflection and transmission probabilities for particles and energy .",
    "2 .   close to equilibrium , one can model the hamiltonian system by persistent random walks . in this case",
    "the system remains of gradient type and thus , the theory of @xcite is still applicable with corrections of the order of @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the size of the system .",
    "far from equilibrium , we demonstrate that there is indeed a non - negligible dependence on the local gradients , and the corresponding profiles can be shown to obey a non - linear differential equation that goes beyond linear response regime .    for our systems",
    "this asymmetry can be seen as a result of two different contributions : one which is purely geometrical and another which has a dynamical origin . for any scattering billiard ( like the model cells )",
    "the reflection probability will in general be different from the transmission purely due to the geometry of the cell .",
    "when some source of interaction among the particles is considered , these coefficients will depend in addition on the local thermodynamical fields ( namely , density and temperature ) of the particles in the cell .",
    "when , in addition , the cell is subjected to an external thermodynamical gradient , the reflection and transmission probabilities will be different at the left and at the right of the cell .",
    "in this situation the dynamical asymmetry is emphasized .",
    "close to equilibrium , the geometric component dominates the dynamics , and then the asymmetry is _ independent _ of the local thermodynamical fields and thus , uniform along the chain .",
    "furthermore , in this simpler case , the bias of the reflection / transmission coefficients is the _ same _ on both sides of any cell .",
    "the corresponding stochastic model is a persistent random walk process like that studied in lorentz gases @xcite . after introducing the model in section  [ sec : hamiltonian ] , in section  [ sec : stochastic ] we sketch the stochastic approximation on which the results of the subsequent sections are inspired on . in section  [ sec : profiles ] ,",
    "we study the case of constant asymmetry and show that one recovers the gradient property observed in @xcite , albeit with a slight correction in the slope of the jump rate profiles .    in the final sections ,",
    "we analyze how the presence of _ non uniform _ local fields changes this picture .",
    "clearly , since the tanks induce an interaction of the particles , the reflection ( or transmission ) probability depends on the local thermodynamical fields .",
    "we will distinguish two contributions to the dynamical asymmetry : one that depends on the mean values of the fields and another one that depends on the local gradients of the fields .",
    "these two effects are added to the purely geometrical contribution of the corresponding non - interacting system .    in order to judge the importance of the asymmetry phenomenon",
    ", we take fixed external fields and let the number of cells be sufficiently large .",
    "this is the standard limit taken in studies of the fourier law @xcite . in our setting ,",
    "the system is no longer of gradient type , and we obtain expressions for the transport equations which go beyond the standard linear regime .",
    "while these equations remain approximate , we verify numerically their validity even very far from equilibrium .",
    "we consider a gas of noninteracting point particles of mass @xmath0 that move freely inside a one - dimensional chain composed of @xmath3 identical two - dimensional cells , arranged horizontally .",
    "each cell is connected to its left and right neighbors through two openings of size @xmath4 .",
    "inside each cell there is a mechanical `` tank '' capable of storing a certain amount of energy .",
    "when a particle hits the tank , some energy exchange takes place , and this is the only interaction in the model .",
    "while the details of this interaction are largely irrelevant for the discussion in this paper , our simulations have been done for the following precise setup which we call the rotating disc model ( rdm ) .",
    "each cell has the geometry described in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .",
    "the energy tank is modeled by a freely rotating disc which is pinned at the center of the cell .",
    "its energy is only rotational .",
    "when a particle hits the disc , it exchanges its tangential velocity @xmath5 with the angular velocity @xmath6 of the disc , while the normal component @xmath7 is reflected @xcite :    [ eq : coll - rule ] =v_t  , v_t=  , v_n=-v_n  .    note that while the particles do not see each other , they effectively interact through their collisions with the tanks .",
    "thus local equilibrium can be reached @xcite .",
    "the model is by no means free .",
    "the chain is connected at both ends to two reservoirs of particles through openings of the same size @xmath4 .",
    "the reservoirs are idealized as infinite chambers containing an ideal gas at a certain density @xmath8 and temperature @xmath9 .",
    "when we study non - equilibrium effects , @xmath8 and @xmath9 will differ at both ends .",
    "another variant of this model has the same fixed walls , but the disc is replaced by a rotating needle , with elastic collision , conserving total energy ( and total angular momentum ) .    .",
    "the radius @xmath10 of the rotating disc is chosen so that no trajectory can cross the cell without undergoing any collision .",
    "the arrows represent the incoming ( @xmath11 ) and outgoing ( @xmath12 ) rates of particles that cross the exits of width @xmath4 .",
    "the rates @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the energy are not shown .",
    "lower right : a chain of 5 cells connected to two baths .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ]    these models are among a class of models satisfying the following minimal assumptions :    1 .",
    "_ time reversibility _ : the trajectory of the system in phase space across a scattering event must be time reversible . while this condition is not really necessary for our derivations , our aim is to model realistic macroscopic situations for which microscopic time - reversibility is believed to hold .",
    "conservation of phase - space volume _ : this condition is not as strong as requiring the dynamics to be hamiltonian , and seems to lead to similar results . in particular , the rotating disc model satisfies this condition but is not hamiltonian : its collision rule preserves phase space volume but is not a canonical transformation .",
    "we call the models satisfying these two assumptions * mechanical*.    we end the description of the model by a more detailed account of the heat and particle baths . from the left reservoir at density @xmath15 and temperature @xmath16 ,",
    "particles are injected into the system at a rate @xmath17 .",
    "observe that the mean energy of the particles injected into the system is not @xmath16 but @xmath18 ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the left reservoir injects energy into the system at a rate @xmath19 given by    q_>=32j_>t _",
    "analogously , the right reservoir injects particles and energy at rates @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "each injected particle will be eventually re - absorbed by one of the reservoirs and this happens when it crosses into that reservoir .",
    "all information about that particle is then discarded .    as the reservoirs consist of an ideal gas ,",
    "the injection rate @xmath11 is a function of the density @xmath8 and temperature of the reservoir given by    [ eq : injection ] j n t^1/2  .",
    "furthermore , the chemical potential at the reservoirs can be written in terms of the injection rate as    [ eq : chem - pot ] = t ( )    with @xmath22 some constant .",
    "we end the section with some comments on the choice of the model : our choice of the reflecting boundaries of fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] is to guarantee the desirable ergodic and mixing properties of chaotic billiards .",
    "however , we have not succeeded in showing rigorously that the cell is either ergodic or mixing . while the geometry of the rotating needles model ( rnm ) is similar to that of the rdm , there are two main differences : first , the rnm is not only mechanical but hamiltonian .",
    "second , in the rnm model , a particle can in principle cross many cells without hitting any needles or boundaries .",
    "this may produce logarithmic corrections to transport , which are beyond our study .",
    "in @xcite , a stochastic approximation of the mechanical model was considered . in this approximation",
    "it was assumed that what happens in one cell is independent of the state of the other cells .",
    "the particles perform a random walk among the cells , mixing their energies with the tanks according to rules which mimic the mechanical system described above .",
    "once the particle has mixed its energy , it waits ( until an exponential clock rings ) and then jumps with equal probability to the left or to the right . with these assumptions",
    "it was found that the rates at which particles and energy jump among neighboring cells are linear functions of the position and from this , energy and particle density along the chain can be computed explicitly under very general assumptions .",
    "however , note that these assumptions are valid when the cells are weakly coupled and dynamical memory effects appear when this is not the case .    the purpose of this paper is to study the consequences of these memory effects on the transport properties of the mechanical models that we consider here .",
    "the price we pay is that the stochastic model , used in @xcite is not longer appropriate .",
    "we briefly sketch the essentials of this stochastic approximation that will serve us as a guideline to our analysis ( we refer the interested reader to @xcite for more details about this ) .",
    "the stochastic description is based on particles , carrying energies , and the discs ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "each state of the cell is represented by a point in @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath0 is the number of particles in the cell at some given time , @xmath25 are their energies , @xmath26 specifies the side on which the particle enter the cell and @xmath27 is the energy stored by the disc . for a chain with @xmath3 cells ,",
    "the phase space is @xmath28 with @xmath3 factors .",
    "the reservoirs at the ends absorb particles , and eject them at a rate @xmath29 resp .",
    "@xmath20 ( for left and right ) and with an exponential distribution of energy ( with mean temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "the stochastic process is as follows ( see @xcite for more details ) : when a particle entered a cell @xmath31 from the left , it will wait for an exponentially distributed time ( whose mean may depend on its energy ) , it mixes energy with the disc , and leaves the cell ( after another exponential waiting time ) with probability @xmath32 to the left , and with probability @xmath33 to the right .",
    "this stochastic description leads , in the steady state , to the balance equations for rates of particle injection ( see below ) .",
    "however , while this description is adequate for particle flux , it is too detailed for the energy flux . instead of trying to formulate a stochastic process for both particle and energy fluxes ( see @xcite for an example ) , we elaborate a phenomenological theory for the physical parameters involved . we show that this information is enough to obtain precise results on the average properties of the steady state of this type of systems .",
    "it is convenient to distinguish the local _ incoming _ rates from the _ outgoing _ rates .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 and @xmath35 the rates at which particles and energy exit the @xmath31-th cell to the left and by @xmath36 , @xmath37 those to the right .",
    "the exit rates are then simply determined by the corresponding incoming rates @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and by reflection @xmath40 , @xmath41 coefficients which will satisfy the balance equations ( for the cell @xmath31 ) :    [ eq : balance ] & j_ , k &  =  & ^_ , k  j_ , k + ( 1-^_,k )  j_,k  , + & j_,k &  =  & ( 1-^_ , k )  j_ , k + ^_,k  j_,k  , +   + & q_ , k &  =  & ^_ , k  q_ , k + ( 1-^_,k )  q_,k  , + & q_,k &  =  & ( 1-^_ , k )  q_ , k + ^_,k  q_,k  . +    note that even for ( left - right ) symmetric cells , out of equilibrium the reflection coefficients at the left and right of the cell are not necessarily equal . the balance equations account for the conservation of energy and particle number , namely @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "since an average the steady state is assumed , mean rates appear in .",
    "we define the coefficients by empirical probabilities @xmath44 by ( omitting the index @xmath31 for better legibility )    [ eq : better ] ^_&= &  , ^_&= &  , + ^_&=&+  , ^_&=&+  ,    where , for example , @xmath45 is the rate of particles leaving on the right , which entered on the left , and @xmath46 is the mean energy carried out by particles which entered on the left .",
    "if we denote @xmath47 the conditional probability that a particle entering with energy @xmath48 leaves with energy @xmath49 and by @xmath50 the probability that it leaves on the left when it entered on the left , then one can think of @xmath51 as    q_ = de de e _ (e,e ) p(e|e )  ,    where the complicated dependence on the state of the system is neglected ( that is , we do not consider the density and the other particles in this formula ) .",
    "instead we will use a phenomenological description for the reflection coefficients .",
    "perhaps it is useful to note that with the above conventions ,    j_ = de de _ (e,e ) p(e|e )  .",
    "the definition for the @xmath52 is canonical , but for the @xmath53 we chose a more complicated expression : it simultaneously preserves total energy conservation , but allows for an energy change during scattering .",
    "the reader should note that the quantities @xmath54 , @xmath12 , @xmath14 are mean values averaged on the ( fluctuating ) steady state .",
    "an important aspect of the present work is to check that this approximation still captures the essentials of transport of heat and particles .    to further simplify the discussion",
    ", we make the approximate assumption that the @xmath55 ( for all @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) only depend on the incoming fluxes . due to the mechanical nature of the models considered here ,",
    "the time scale is a free variable leading to the scaling relation @xmath58 for all @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 only depends on 3 ratios .",
    "it will be useful to distinguish the contribution to @xmath60 that arises out of equilibrium from the contribution that only depends on the mean values of the fields .",
    "accordingly we write    [ eq : alpha - cont ] ( j_ , j_,q_ , q _ ) = _ ( ) + ( , , )  ,    and require that @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ , that @xmath62 vanishes at equilibrium .",
    "the term @xmath63 , which has a purely geometric origin , describes in turns those aspects which hold at thermal equilibrium and the term @xmath64 , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , is proportional to the density ( see eq .  ) .",
    "note that @xmath67 corresponds to the simple symmetric random walk considered in @xcite .",
    "the case when the @xmath55 are independent of the local fields , but different from @xmath68 corresponds to a persistent random walk and will be studied in the next section .",
    "more general and realistic laws will be investigated in the last sections .",
    "also note that the details of the dynamics , in particular those that depend on the specific model , are encoded by eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha - cont ] . to show the validity of our approach we will proceed as follows : we first introduce the law .",
    "this closes the balance equations for the energy and particle number .",
    "we next determine the thermodynamical profiles and currents .",
    "finally we compare these `` theoretical '' profiles to those obtained with numerical simulations of the mechanical model .",
    "in this section , we discuss profiles in the infinite volume limit with fixed boundary conditions , under the approximating assumption that every cell is at local equilibrium .",
    "this means that we neglect the term @xmath62 in eq .   and thus , @xmath69 and similarly for the @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , we make the assumption , that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are independent of the densities found in the chain . in this approximation",
    "the reflection coefficient is a constant independent of the thermodynamical fields and thus , independent of position .",
    "the exact range of validity of this assumption will be discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : bias ] .",
    "our approximations mean that we are dealing with the case of a persistent random walk , and the current section , while `` well - known '' in principle , serves as a first check of the validity of our approximations .",
    "once this check has been done , we will study in more detail the corrections to the persistent case .    since the geometric contribution is the only one remaining in ( [ eq : alpha - cont ] ) , we refer to this case as the * geometric approximation*. note that this contribution will lead in general to a reflection coefficient different from @xmath68 .",
    "this approximation corresponds to a persistent random walk in which the probability for the walker to move forward is different from the probability to move backwards .",

    "these corrections disappear in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the integral over @xmath82 of the correction vanishes , because of energy and particle conservation .",
    "also , note that as @xmath83 is a constant , the profiles are linear ( even when @xmath84 ) , because the system is still of gradient type .    * proof * : the proof is just a calculation .",
    "we will concentrate on the case of particle rates .",

    "the case is handled similarly .",
    "therefore , if the value for @xmath88 is known , the profile of the ejection rates can be obtained from the solution for any nonequilibrium state , as long as @xmath88 is independent of the external parameters .      in order to identify temperature and particle density",
