    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary stars composed of a white dwarf primary and a roche lobe filling m dwarf secondary . in the case of hu",
    "aqr , an am  her class cv , the material being accreted by the primary from the secondary is channelled along an accretion stream by the white dwarf s magnetic field . a comprehensive overview of these systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "such systems are known to exhibit quasi - periodic variations in their photometry .",
    "a number of factors can contribute to those variations , with well accepted causes including the level of activity of the secondary ( star spots and associated stellar cycles ) and also that star s shape .",
    "a number of recent studies have suggested that certain cvs host planetary - mass companions . as the postulated planetary companions orbit the central stars , they cause those stars to move back and forth as they orbit around the system s centre of mass . as a result ,",
    "the distance between the earth and the host stars varies as a function of time , meaning that the light from the stars must sometimes travel further to reach us than at other times .",
    "this effect results in measurable variations in the timing of mutual eclipse events between the two stars that can be measured from the earth . using this method ,",
    "planetary mass companions have recently been announced around the cvs uz  for @xcite , nn  ser @xcite , dp  leo @xcite , and hu  aqr @xcite . in each of these studies",
    ", the eclipse timings are first fitted to a linear ephemeris .",
    "the residuals from this ephemeris ( the @xmath1 , or @xmath2 timings ) are then plotted and found to show further , higher - order variations .",
    "these @xmath1 timings can then be fit with one or more superposed keplerian orbits in a manner essentially identical to that employed in doppler radial - velocity planet detection . in @xcite",
    ", we used the methodology of @xcite to simulate the long - term dynamical stability of the two giant planets proposed as orbiting hu  aqr @xcite .",
    "we showed that the nominal 2-planet solution was extremely unstable on short timescales ( @xmath3 yr ) , unless the outer planet orbited in a retrograde and coplanar sense relative to the inner ( i.e.  with the two planetary orbits inclined by 180 degrees to one another ) .",
    "given that such a configuration seems highly unlikely , we suggested that either the system is currently undergoing a dynamical rearrangement ( also highly improbable given the @xmath4 yr age of the post - main - sequence primary ) , or that the system is significantly different from that proposed by @xcite .    in this work , we apply the standard statistical methods used by the radial - velocity planet search community to the timing data for hu  aqr given by @xcite .",
    "section  2 briefly describes the observational data used for our analysis . in section  3 ,",
    "we detail the analysis methods applied to these data , and the resulting planetary system configurations implied . in section  4",
    "we discuss the dynamical implications of our results , before exploring possible alternatives to the planet hypothesis in section  5 .",
    "following the discovery paper by @xcite , we make use of the same 82 @xmath1 eclipse egress times , consisting of 72 data points from the literature @xcite , and 10 new timings presented by @xcite .",
    "all eclipse timings have been fitted with a linear ephemeris given by    @xmath5    the residuals from the fit to this linear ephemeris are plotted in figure  [ inputdata ] .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) scatter in the timing data is 13.4 seconds , and the reduced @xmath6 of the linear ephemeris is quite large at 108.6 .",
    "there are significant deviations from the linear ephemeris , suggestive of additional perturbing bodies which result in periodic eclipse timing variations .",
    "we therefore proceed with fitting keplerian orbits to these signals .",
    "eclipse timings for hu  aqr , after fitting a linear ephemeris ( given by equation  1 ) .",
    "a quadratic fit to these data is overplotted as a solid line .",
    "the data are those used in @xcite , which include 72 observations initially presented by @xcite .",
    "at least one sinusoidal variation is evident , suggesting the presence of at least one additional perturbing body . ]",
    "in this section , we detail the orbit - fitting process for two cases . first , in  3.1",
    ", we follow @xcite , and consider the data after the removal of a quadratic trend . in  3.2 , we attempt to fit the data without removing a quadratic trend .",
    "it is well accepted that in fitting radial - velocity data ( to which results on eclipse timing are clearly analogous ) , if a long - period object is suspected , the removal of a quadratic trend from the data is not ideal . the physically meaningful function to fit and remove is a keplerian ( if the variation is thought to be due to planetary orbits ) . as the keplerian function is a complex one , and",
    "not necessarily well approximated by a quadratic , it is both preferable and more rigorous to attempt to fit a keplerian orbit  even if the parameters so derived are not well - constrained , one will at least not introduce spurious signals due to a poor match between a quadratic and a keplerian .      in order to test the results of @xcite",
    ", we match their approach by fitting keplerian orbits after removing a long - term quadratic trend .",
    "first , we fit a quadratic trend to the original timing data ; the fitted parameters are      where @xmath8 is the observation date in the form ( julian date-2400000 ) .",
    "then , we fit a single planet ( model  a1 ) .",
    "a standard lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite shows a clear signal near 3500 days ( figure  [ pgrams1 ] ) .",
    "we fit a keplerian orbit model using _ gaussfit _ @xcite .",
    "the single - planet solution is given in table  [ planetparams ] as `` model  a1 . ''",
    "the residuals to the 1-planet fit are shown in figure  [ a1resids ] , as is the periodogram of those residuals .",
    "after removing the dominant periodicity , there is a significant peak at @xmath98000 days . using the bootstrap randomisation method described by @xcite ,",
    "this peak is found to have a false - alarm probability ( fap ) of @xmath100.01% ( 10000 bootstraps ) .",
    "owing to the high significance of this residual peak , and the large rms of the 1-planet residuals ( 6.57 sec : table  [ planetparams ] ) , we proceed by fitting a second planet ."
