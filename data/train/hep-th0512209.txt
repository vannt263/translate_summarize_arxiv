    "the standard cosmological model , based on the general relativity theory , has been successfully tested until the nucleosynthesis era , around @xmath5 , that is , at @xmath6@xcite . at times before this era",
    ", it is only possible to speculate on how the universe has behaved .",
    "there are some claims that the spectrum of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) has allowed to test the inflationary scenario , opening a window to energy levels of about @xmath7@xcite .",
    "however , this last statement remains controversial@xcite : there is not , at this moment , a unique , complete , inflationary model , free of problems like transplanckian frequencies and fine tuning of fundamental parameters . in this sense",
    "the inflationary model remains a theoretical proposal asking for a full consistent formulation .",
    "moreover , the fitting of the cmbr spectrum is made through a quite large number of parameters ( up to ten ) , and more results , like the identification of the gravitational waves contribution to the cmbr anisotropy through the full detection of the polarization parameters of the cmb photons are necessary in order to surmount the degeneracy in the parameter space . finally , neither the standard cosmological model nor the inflationary scenario address the question of the initial singularity , which is a major problem in the primordial cosmology .",
    "hence , the very early universe remains an open area of research .",
    "string theory@xcite is , at the moment , the most important candidate to a fundamental theory of nature unifying all interactions including gravity . at very low energy levels , string theory reduces to general relativity in its gravity sector . on the other hand , at higher energies ,",
    "it predicts a deviation from the general relativity framework : the dilaton field couples non - minimally to the einstein - hilbert term ; the neveu - schwarz sector exhibits also an axion field , which in four dimensions is equivalent to a scalar field which couples with the dilaton ; in the ramond - ramond sector , scalar fields and gauge fields , minimally coupled to gravity and to the dilaton field , are present .",
    "moreover , string theory is formulated in ten dimensions , and the reduction to four dimensions leads to the appearance of moduli fields associated with the dynamics of the extra dimensions .",
    "string theory itself may be incorporated in a more fundamental structure in @xmath8 dimensions ( @xmath9 theory ) , @xmath10 dimensions ( @xmath11 theory ) and so on .",
    "all these complex structures lead , in principle , to a strong deviation from the standard cosmological scenario at very high energies .",
    "the question we address here is how such a rich structure affects the evolution of the universe in its primordial phase .",
    "this problem has already been studied in many aspects in the literature@xcite .",
    "the pre - big bang scenario@xcite , the ekpyrotic model@xcite , and the string gas cosmology @xcite are some of them .",
    "however , all these attempts are plagued with some important difficulties : to construct a completely regular cosmological scenario , without any kind of singularity , which consequences can be successfully tested against observation .",
    "general scalar - tensor systems which reduce to the particular string effective action for some values of the free parameters , have been considered in the literature @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , a @xmath12 dimensional lagrangian has been analyzed , with two free parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are connected with the coupling of the dilaton and the axion fields , respectively .",
    "the original configuration has been compactified considering flat , static extra dimensions . for a specific range of values of @xmath0 , scenarios with no curvature singularity",
    "have been obtained .",
    "however , the dilaton field is null initially , pointing out a singularity in the string expansion parameter , and thus rendering the effective model inadequate at that moment . in reference @xcite fields from the ramond - ramond sector",
    "have been considered .",
    "this allows to avoid the singularity in the string expansion parameter , but only in the case of large negative values of @xmath0 , that is , @xmath13 .",
    "this implies the presence of negative energies when the lagrangian is re - expressed in the einstein frame .",
    "the @xmath12 dimensional structure has been studied , in the vacuum case , in reference @xcite and regular solutions have been obtained , again for large negative values @xmath0 .    in the present work ,",
    "we perform a two - fold analysis .",
    "first , we explore another possibility with respect to some previous works ( mainly references @xcite ) : we take into account the dynamics of the extra dimensions , and a radiative fluid whose presence is suggested by a maxwellian field in the ramond - ramond sector . again",
    ", completely regular models can be obtained , this time for a larger range of values of the parameter @xmath0 , mainly with respect to the results of reference @xcite : this parameter must still be negative , but in four dimensions it can be greater than @xmath14 .",
    "the pure string case , which is characterized by @xmath2 , still leads to scenarios which are not completely regular ; in fact this particular value can imply regularity only when the number of extra dimensions goes to infinity . on the other hand , even if @xmath15 , there are possible connections between @xmath9 and @xmath11 theories .",
    "we describe the features of these models , which display a bounce in the scale factor , while the dilaton and the moduli fields remain regular .",
    "we then test the new scenario obtained here against observations , as well as those obtained in @xcite , by computing the spectrum of scalar perturbations .",
    "the general result is that these models predict a decreasing power spectrum , which disagrees strongly with observations@xcite . as a general feature ,",
    "all the scenarios lead to a spectral index for scalar perturbations that is around @xmath16 .",
    "this means that it is not possible to construct a realistic regular cosmological scenario based on the string ( and more general frameworks ) effective action at tree level unless , perhaps , some non trivial compactification scheme is introduced , or more complex configurations are considered like , for example , the ( condensate ) fermionic terms .    in the next section",

    "our starting point is the string effective action in @xmath12 dimensions at tree level coupled to a radiative field : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the dilatonic field , @xmath23 is the axionic field , @xmath24 is a scalar field coming from the ramond - ramond sector and @xmath25 represents the matter lagrangian , in this case a radiative fluid .",
    "the origin of the radiative fluid may be traced back to electromagnetic terms present in the ramond - ramond sector . in the pure string case , @xmath26 , but other values of @xmath27",

    "the metric fluctuation must be expressed in terms of a new variable that is formally equivalent to a free scalar field . at this moment , the fields are quantized , leading to normalized modes . choosing an initial vacuum state ,",
    "the initial spectrum expressed in the conformal time reads    @xmath187    where @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "for the other fields , represented generically by @xmath191 , one has @xmath192 in terms of the @xmath193 parameter one has : @xmath194\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\exp\\biggl[\\frac{i\\tilde{n}4b_0 ^ 2 } { \\sqrt{3}\\sinh^2(7\\pi/2)(\\theta-\\theta_i)}\\biggr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath195 .\\ ] ]    with these initial conditions , the system is left to evolve . due to the complexity of the perturbed equations and of the background solutions ,",
    "the system of equations is solved numerically , with the initial conditions fixed as described before , using the software _",
    "mathematica_. the processed final spectrum is given by @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the spectral index .",
    "the bardeen potential @xmath198 in the jordan frame is related to the potential in the einstein frame by @xmath199 the spectrum is computed at the moment the universe matches the standard model in the radiative era before the nucleosynthesis .",
    "the general behaviour of the spectrum , for all cases , is given in figure @xmath101 for a large range of values of @xmath200 .",
    "in general , it display an oscillating behaviour with decreasing amplitude .",
    "however , the cosmological scales of interest , determined by the matching conditions together with the normalization of the scale factor today , imply @xmath201 . for this case , and for scales today between @xmath164 and @xmath165",
    "the spectrum has the shape displayed in figure @xmath202 , again for all the cases treated in the present study .",
    "it is a decreasing spectrum , in strong disagreement with the observation which indicates a nearly harrisson - zeldovich spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that in all different cases the spectral index is essentially @xmath203 .",
    "we have computed the spectrum at constant time and , in this situation , a harrison - zeldovich spectrum implies that @xmath204 grows with @xmath200 .",
    "we have studied cosmological models based on the string effective action at tree level .",
    "the dilaton , the axion , rr and the moduli fields were taken into account , besides gauge fields coming from the ramond - ramond sector .",
    "two free parameters were introduced in the effective lagrangian , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , connected with the coupling of the dilaton and axion fields .",
    "these parameters were kept free in order to cover fundamental theories , like @xmath9 and @xmath11 theories , as well as @xmath205-branes configurations in the superstring theory .",
    "regular solutions were found , but only for cases where @xmath15 , which excludes the pure string case .",
    "the new solutions found here , taking into account the moduli fields , exhibit compactification of the extra dimensions .",
    "the scale factor displays a bounce , exhibiting initially a contracting phase before entering the expansion phase .",
    "asymptotically , a radiative phase is recovered allowing to match the solution with the standard cosmological model . at the same time , the string expansion parameter remains finite during the whole evolution of the universe .",
    "the effective gravitational coupling decreases with time what , at least , alleviate the hierarchial problem related to the characteristic energy scale of gravity .",
    "the properties of the solutions found reveal that such `` string '' cosmological models can be candidates for describing the primordial phase of the universe .",
    "however , traces from this primordial phase can be compared with observations through the evaluation of the power spectrum of scalar fluctuations .",
    "this primordial power spectrum is inferred from the spectrum of the anisotropy of the cmbr .",
    "the observational results favor a flat spectrum . here , we have computed the spectrum at the beginning of the radiative phase supposing that the initial fluctuations were formed in the beginning of the contraction phase , before the bounce , and that they were of quantum mechanical origin .",
    "the quantum fluctuations are compatible with the asymptotical behaviour in the beginning of the contracting phase .",
    "however , the final spectrum is strongly decreasing , in contradiction with the observational results , which favors at least a quasi - scale invariant spectrum .",
    "hence , the regular solutions found , in spite of their nice features , are not candidate for a realistic primordial cosmological model , the same features are found for the regular `` anomalous '' solutions found in reference @xcite .",
    "in fact , the result @xmath3 for the spectral index is not surprising . in reference",
    "@xcite , the same spectrum has been obtained in the einstein frame for a scalar field with negative kinetic energy together with radiation .",
    "here the situation is very similar , see equations ( [ e14a],[e15a ] ) , but with the presence of other fields .",
    "these other fields do not alter the bounce itself and , most important , the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "it seems that the intermediate phase they can be important is not relevant for the spectrum at large scales .",
    "going to the jordan s frame does not modify the result because the spectrum of @xmath144 is negligible with respect to that of @xmath143 for small wave numbers .",
    "these results seem to exclude such string motivated models at tree level . nevertheless , it must be stressed that in the model developed here a quite simple compactification mechanism was considered : the internal space is flat , a @xmath206-dimensional torus .",
    "string theory admits many other kinds of compactifications .",
    "in particular , the calabi - yau manifolds are especially interesting since they can accommodate , in quite natural way , the gauge groups of the standard model of particle physics @xcite . in this case",
    ", the effective model in four dimensions will be different to the one we have studied here .",
    "however , the negative results reported here indicate difficulties in constructing meaningful realistic cosmological models based on string motivated effective actions at tree level .      90 e.w .",
