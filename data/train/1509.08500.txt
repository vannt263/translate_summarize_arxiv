    "the horizon and the flatness problems , the existence of magnetic monopoles and the origin of the large scales structures , @xcite , were the great cosmological puzzles of the twentieth century . to solve these problems , an inflationary phase @xcite has been added to the description of the very early universe .    since its establishment , several inflationary testable models were built , providing a description of the universe in its early stages : new , chaotic , extended , power - law , hybrid , natural , supernatural , extra - natural , eternal , dterm , f - term , brane , oscillating , trace - anomaly driven , k , ghost , tachyon , etc .",
    "one simple and elegant model for inflation was derived and called as chaotic inflation @xcite , in which the inflaton potential is simply a quadratic function of @xmath0 .    the inflationary phase is basically described considering an accelerated expansion of space - time with @xmath1 , being @xmath2 the scale factor of the universe .",
    "this condition implies that the comoving hubble radius @xmath3 decreases with time , while @xmath4 increases . considering a homogeneous and isotropic metric",
    ", the field equations are given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hubble parameter that indicates the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath7 is the spatial curvature , where positive , zero , and negative values correspond respectively to closed , flat , and open spatial sections , @xmath8 is the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath9 is the matter density and @xmath10 is the pressure . with the previous expression ( [ fieldeq ] ) , we see that for an accelerated expansion of the universe , the relation between the density and pressure of the fluid must be @xmath11 , violating the strong energy condition .    to solve a number of problems in the big bang model",
    ", the inflationary period also brought a number of issues that needed to be answered @xcite . among these issues ,",
    "the creation of matter and radiation is one of the most challenging .",
    "the problem is as follows : the expansion during inflation is so huge that , when inflation ends , any pre - existing matter is very diluted and the universe is very cold . to return to the situations established by the standard cosmological model",
    ", the elements involved in inflation should transmit energy to the relativistic matter that will dominate the next phase of evolution of the universe .",
    "this process of energy exchange at the end of the inflationary era is called reheating and involves changing from a cold and almost matterless universe to a hot universe dominated by relativistic particles .",
    "this exchange of energy must be such that the present production of entropy within our observable horizon is around @xmath12 and the matter density is in the order of @xmath13 @xcite .    in most models of inflation ,",
    "the expansion of the universe is governed by a classical scalar field @xmath0 called inflaton , which stores the whole energy of the very early universe @xcite . at the end of inflation",
    "the inflaton begins to oscillate around the minimum of the effective potential and transfers energy to others pre - existing fields through parametric resonance @xcite , which fills the universe with particles and radiation .",
    "these particles ( including photons ) begin to interact with each other until the moment when the universe reaches its thermal equilibrium , which is called thermalization .",
    "this is the simplest description of the reheating phase of the universe .",
    "the initial stage of the reheating is called preheating @xcite and can be divided into two parts : in the first one , when the inflaton interacts with itself and its initial amplitude of oscillations is large enough , the back - reaction process of the created particles can be neglected and the decay occurs exponentially , generating a large occupation numbers in some frequency bands .",
    "the time interval for the creation of the particles is generally lower than the expansion of the universe and we can disregard it .",
    "the second stage , where the expansion of the universe becomes relevant , occurs when the back - reaction and feedback effects becomes significant , being necessary to take into account its interaction with the decaying quantum particles created by harmonic oscillations of the inflaton field in an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "the preheating stage happens within a scenario where the main mechanism is the broad parametric resonance @xcite and the end of this phase occurs when the created particles are far away of equilibrium , but with extremely large mean occupation numbers .",
    "after the preheating , gradually , the energy oscillations is transferred into energy of the ultra - relativistic particles .",
    "reheating is completed at the moment when the energy density of the universe and thermal energy of the created ultra - relativistic particles are equal .",
    "the reheating temperature , determined by the total decay rate of the inflaton @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the planck mass .    despite the inflationary phase",
    "has several observational constraints , the reheating stage of the universe is difficult to describe and its theoretical parameters , like the e - folding number @xmath17 and the effective equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath18 , are complicated to relate to the currently available observational data .",
    "one way to make this connection is to relate inflation and reheating through the time when the cmb perturbations cross outside the hubble radius ( featuring inflation ) and the subsequent time when the perturbations cross inside the hubble radius ( featuring reheating ) @xcite .",
    "this can be expressed as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the wavenumber , @xmath21 is the number of e - folds between horizon crossing and the end of inflation , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the number of e - folds between the end o inflation and the end o reheating and between the end of reheating and the end of radiation - dominated era , respectively .",
    "thus it is clear that we can use the observable parameters of cmb to obtain constrains associated with the reheating era .",
    "this technique has been broadly used in the literature @xcite assuming a constant equation of state parameter during reheating . in this work",
    "we use the same technique in order to calculate the length of reheating and the temperature at the end of the era in some single - field inflationary models , adopting a step - like function and a continuous time dependent equation of state during reheating .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : reheating ] we present three models for the equation of state parameter during reheating and use them to relate the duration of the reheating phase and the reheating temperature to the inflationary parameters . in section [ sec : inflation ] , we review the polynomial , starobinsky and higgs inflationary models and see how they constraint reheating . and finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "the comoving hubble scale @xmath24 when the primordial fluctuations crossed the hubble radius during inflation can be related to the present scale @xcite , @xmath25    here , @xmath20 is the scale of horizon exit and can be fixed as the pivot scaled at which a specific cmb experiment determines the scalar spectral index @xmath26 .",
    "we will use planck s pivot scale of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "`` @xmath28 '' , `` @xmath29 '' , `` @xmath30 '' and `` @xmath31 '' mean the end of inflation , the end of reheating , the time of radiation - matter equality and today , respectively . defining @xmath32 as the number of e - folds between horizon crossing and the end of inflation , @xmath33 and @xmath34 as the number of e - folds between the end of inflation and the end of reheating and between the end of reheating and the end of radiation - dominated era , respectively , we can find the relation @xmath35    for a given inflationary model and from observational constraints on the primordial power spectrum we can calculate @xmath21 .",
    "with help of equation ( [ eq : scale ] ) and another expression that gives the post - inflationary evolution of the energy density and temperature we can calculate @xmath22 and @xmath36 .",
    "the energy density at the end of reheating is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of relativistic species at the end of reheating , which we will assume @xmath39 .",
    "the subsequent density evolution is mainly driven by radiation until the radiation - matter equality time .",
    "assuming that the entropy is conserved between the end of reheating and the present time we can relate the reheating temperature to the temperature today with the relation @xmath40    in equation ( [ eq : t1 ] ) the ratio @xmath41 can be rewritten as @xmath42 and assuming the horizon crossing condition @xmath43 , the ratio @xmath44 can be expanded as @xmath45 and we can finally write an expression for the reheating temperature @xmath36 that is a function of the inflationary model and the cosmic evolution between the end of inflation and the beginning of radiation - dominated era , i. e. , during reheating , @xmath46 notice , from equation ( [ eq : t_reheating ] ) , that the shorter the reheating era , the larger will be the temperature at the end of reheating .    the energy density evolution during reheating is determined with help of the conservation relation @xmath47 , where over - dot means time derivative and @xmath48 is the equation of state parameter . integrating from the end of inflation ( beginning of reheating )",
    "until the end of reheating one finds @xmath49    in the next subsections we will calculate the energy density evolution during reheating for three different , but equivalent , models .      assuming a constant equation of state parameter of value @xmath50 one can easily find that @xmath51 in section [ sec : inflation ]",
    "we will show that the energy density at the end of inflation is @xmath52 .",
    "plugging the temperature equation ( [ eq : t_reheating ] ) into the density equation ( [ eq : density_reheating ] ) and substituting the result in equation ( [ eq : density1 ] ) one can find , for @xmath53 @xmath54 \\,,\\ ] ] where we used @xmath33 and assumed @xmath55 .",

    "one can find a @xmath36 that depends on the inflationary model and @xmath50 .",
    "this result is already known in the literature @xcite and is reproduced here for comparison .",
    "inflation ends when potential and kinetic energy are comparable , which makes the equation of state parameter raise from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . at this point",
    "the equation of state parameter starts to oscillate between @xmath58 ( potential dominance ) and @xmath60 ( kinetic dominance ) , while it decays toward @xmath31 , which is the equation of state parameter value at the beginning of reheating .",
    "as the inflaton transfers its energy to some other field , the equation of state parameter evolves from @xmath31 to @xmath61 , when begins radiation dominance .",
    "it was shown that in a simple @xmath62 inflationary model , which interacts with the decay product @xmath63 via @xmath64 , the equation of state parameter evolves abruptly from @xmath31 to @xmath65  @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "although the equation of state parameter jumps from @xmath31 to radiation domination almost instantaneously , which allow us to treat @xmath50 as a constant during the whole reheating process , we will take into consideration this abrupt transition . the price to pay are new parameters that give shape to the jump .    assuming a reheating model where the equation of state parameter changes discontinuously",

    "we show that it is possible to recover the discontinuous case from the continuous one and , more important , figure [ fig : poly_3_kappa ] shows that our final result for the continuous case do not depends on @xmath80 , that is the extra model parameter that controls how sharp is the jump of the equation of state parameter during reheating .    in this work we considered @xmath68 and @xmath163 , since we think it is more consistent with the result found in @xcite .",
    "the main effect of this choice is that the regions between our curves in the @xmath164 and @xmath165 planes are much more narrow when compared with the ones that are found in the literature , which consider a constant equation of state parameter in the range @xmath132 . for the discontinuous equation of state parameter case the curves do not converge to the same point in case of instantaneous reheating ( @xmath138 ) , but this feature can be recovered for the continuous jump , although this point is very slightly dislocated in favor of a bigger scalar spectral index @xmath26 . in both continuous and discontinuous jumps",
    "there is a bend in the trajectory of the curves , which coincides with the fixed value of @xmath74 , that is the point where the equation of state parameter changes its value from @xmath68 to @xmath166 .",
    "the present constraints for the inflationary parameters are consistent with various models for inflation and allows a broad range of reheating temperatures .",
    "although we showed that , as claimed in the literature , to consider a constant equation of state parameter during reheating can be a good approximation , we also saw that taking into account a varying equation of state can bring some small features to the model ."
