    ", this formulation has given us a wealth of information about the phase diagram and thermodynamics at finite temperature and limited chemical potential(see for example refs .",
    "@xcite . in response to the lattice qcd simulations ,",
    "many phenomenological approaches in terms of effective degrees of freedom have been developed to give interpretation of the available lattice data and further to make prediction in the region of phase diagram that ca nt be reached by the lattice qcd .",
    "a promising ansatz of this sort approach is the polyakov - loop improved nambu",
    " jona - lasinio model ( pnjl )  @xcite , which combines the two principal non - perturbative features of low - energy qcd : confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a simple formalism .",
    "the validity of pnjl model has been tested in a series works by confronting the pnjl results with the lattice qcd data  @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the 2 flavor ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks ) pnjl model can reproduce the result that the crossovers for deconfinement phase transition and the chiral phase transition almost coincide  @xcite . for finite chemical potential ,",
    "further investigations suggest that the thermodynamics and susceptibilities obtained in pnjl model are perfectly in agreement with the corresponding lattice qcd data  @xcite .",
    "recently , the impact of polyakov - loop dynamics on the color superconductivity phase transition and on the pion superfluidity phase transition within pnjl have been explored in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "although the entanglement of the chiral and the polyakov - loop dynamics turns out to be indispensable to understand the nature of qcd phase transitions and thermodynamical behavior , the investigations based on this idea up to now are all performed for the two flavor case with small current quark mass so far . whether the synthesis of polyakov - loop dynamics with the njl model when including strange quark works well is still unknown .",
    "neverthelss , the study of the critical temperature of the 2 + 1 flavor qcd phase transition by the lattice qcd simulations with physical masses in the continuum limit have recently been reported  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is interesting to extend the 2 flavor pnjl model to the 2 + 1 flavor ( i.e. , including not only @xmath0 , @xmath1 quarks , but also @xmath2 quark ) case to compare with the recent results of the lattice simulations .",
    "in addition , it is worth investigating the 2 + 1 flavor qcd phase diagram at finite baryon chemical potential in the njl model with polyakov - loop .",
    "one should note that , in the absence of dynamical quarks , the polyakov - loop expectation value can be taken as an order parameter to identify the color confinement and deconfinement in pure gauge theories ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . with the introduction of dynamical quarks with physical masses ,",
    "the exact @xmath3 center symmetry for the gauge fields is lost and the polyakov - loop is no longer an exact order parameter for the transition from the low temperature , confined phase , to the high temperature , deconfined phase . however , with the distribution function of the quark states , the polyakov - loop expectation value can still describe the evolution from color - singlet tri - quark state to color - triplet single quark state . moreover , the results of lattice qcd  @xcite",
    "show that the polyakov - loop is also an useful quantity to locate the crossover for deconfinement .",
    "then , the terminology  confinement \" we take here is the statistical suppression of the color - triplet quark propagation , but not the dynamical quark confinement .",
    "similarly , the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the nonvanishing current masses of quarks .",
    "however the chiral condensate is also useful to indicate the chiral crossover .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the 2 flavor pnjl model to 2 + 1 flavor case to explore the qcd thermodynamics and phase diagram at finite temperature and nonzero chemical potential .",
    "the focuses are concentrated on the validity of 2 + 1 flavor pnjl at finite temperature in comparison with lattice qcd data and its predictions for the case at nonzero chemical potential and finite temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we extend the pnjl model to the case of 2 + 1 flavors . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the phase transition of strongly interacting matter at finite temperature and zero chemical potential by analyzing the polyakov - loop , the chiral susceptibility of light quarks , the strange quark number susceptibility and other related quantities as functions of temperature at zero chemical potential and comparing the results with those of lattice qcd simulations . in section 4",
    ", we make predictions for the phase transitions in the case at nonzero chemical potential and finite temperature and give a phase diagram of the strongly interacting matter in terms of the temperature and chemical potential .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we give a summary and conclusion .",

    "the width given by the improved effective potential is narrower , we should note that recent lattice qcd results show that the normalized pressure for full qcd with dynamical fermions looks the same as that in the pure gauge theories  @xcite , which indicates that it may be the dynamics of gluons that drives the qcd phase transition , but not that of the fermions  @xcite . and",

    "[ f3 ] manifest that the location of this pseudo - critical point is affected by both the deconfinement and the chiral crossovers . because of the common influences by these two crossovers , we find @xmath111 for the polynomial potential , which is in the between of the deconfinement pseudo - critical point @xmath112 and the chiral critical point @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "this phenomenon is more obvious in the result of the improved effective potential , where a sharp peak appears at the deconfinement transition point @xmath113 on the curve of @xmath108 .",
    "it manifests evidently @xmath114 .",
    "in addition , the peak is followed by a little platform coming from the contribution of the chiral crossover for light quarks due to the flavor - mixing effects .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood as the follows .",
    "being not color - singlets , there are almost no free strange quarks before the deconfinement crossover takes place .",
    "as the temperature increases , the crossover for the deconfinement occurs and the strange quark number susceptibility develops to finite values abruptly . in general case , the quasiparticle energy of strange quarks becomes smaller due to the partial reduction of the condensate of strange quarks which is along with the light quarks chiral crossover because of the flavor - mixing interactions .",
    "it leads it easier to excite quarks , and in turn to increase the value of the quark number susceptibility .",
    "however , since the improved effective potential represents the gluon dynamics better and the deconfinement crossover governed by the gluon dynamics occurs more abruptly as mentioned above , the increasing rate of the strange quark number susceptibility with respect to temperature induced by the deconfinement crossover dominates over that induced by the reduction of the quark condensate at the deconfinement pseudo - critical temperature .",
    "as a consequence , the pseudo - critical temperature given by the strange quark number susceptibility coincides with that for the deconfinement crossover . as the temperature increases further , the reduction of the quasiparticle energy of the quark begins to play the role , it generates then a platform in the curves of @xmath108 . in order to study the influence of the deconfinement crossover on the @xmath115",
    "further we turn off the flavor - mixing interaction by setting @xmath107 .",
    "the obtained results are illustrated in the thicker curves in fig .",
    "we find again that @xmath109 gradually develops a finite value with the appearance of the deconfinement phase .",
    "since the @xmath109 is no longer influenced by the light quark chiral crossover any more , the difference between the pseudo - critical temperatures given by the two effective potentials is much smaller than that with the flavor - mixing being taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the curve of @xmath108 for the polynomial potential moves down to lower temperature obviously and there are not any platforms on the curve of @xmath108 for the improved effective potential .",
    "therefore , we could qualitatively understand the results of lattice qcd simulations in ref .  @xcite that the pseudo - critical point determined from the strange quark number susceptibility is quite close to that determined from the polyakov loop . nevertheless , it is not obvious that the quark number susceptibility has any relations with the chiral crossover for light quarks , which maybe indicates that the flavor - mixing interactions are relatively weak at high temperature .     at several strange quark masses ( right panel ) . ]    in order to investigate the influences of the current mass of strange quark on the properties of chiral and deconfinement crossover in the case of including the flavor - mixing effects , we depict the scaled strange quark condensate and the polyakov - loop as functions of temperature with different values of strange quark current mass in fig .",

    "the same thing occurs for the deconfinement crossover outside the chiral phase boundary of light quarks .    , @xmath125 , and with different flavor - mixing interaction strengthes : @xmath61 ( thicker curves ) and @xmath168 ( thinner curves ) .",

    "their corresponding phase diagrams are depicted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f15 ] . here , @xmath61 is chosen .",
    "since the current mass of strange quark is the same as those of light quarks , the strange quark chiral transition coincides with those of light quarks and there is no dash - dotted line in the phase diagram .",
    "when the current mass of strange quark is reduced from @xmath171 to @xmath172 , both the critical value of @xmath14 at @xmath173 and that of @xmath47 at @xmath56 decrease , and the cep moves toward to the @xmath47-axis . if the values of both @xmath11 and @xmath10 are further reduced , for example in the chiral limit , we find that the cep disappears from the phase diagram and there is only first order chiral transition in the whole range of chemical potential and temperature , which is illustrated by the thinner dotted line in the right panel of fig .",
    "this result is quite consistent with the pisarski - wilczek argument  @xcite that the order of the temperature driven chiral symmetry restoration transition is first order for three massless quarks . in the framework of the pnjl model ,",
    "this could be understood as a result of that the thermodynamical potential involves a term cubic in the chiral condensate , because of the t hooft interaction . to study the the dependence of the phase evolution on the flavor - mixing interaction more thoroughly ,",
    "we perform a series calculations by reducing the strength of the flavor - mixing interactions gradually and find that when the flavor - mixing interaction strength @xmath167 decreases to a value of about @xmath174 , the order of the temperature driven chiral transition is changed from first to second .",
    "in summary , we have extended the polyakov - loop improved njl model to the 2 + 1 flavor case with inclusion of strange quark .",
    "this 2 + 1 flavor pnjl is a synthesis of the conventional 2 + 1 flavor njl model , which includes the flavor - mixing t hooft interaction , and the polyakov - loop dynamics governed by a polyakov - loop effective potential . within the framework of such a model",

    "more concretely , we investigate the chiral and deconfinement crossovers with finite temperature at zero quark chemical potential with physical current mass of strange quark .",
    "three kinds of pseudo - critical temperature corresponding to three different quantities : polyakov - loop , chiral susceptibility of light quarks and strange quark number susceptibility , are determined in the pnjl model . by employing two polyakov - loop effective potentials existing in literatures , viz .",
    "the polynomial effective potential and the improved one , we all find that different observables lead to different values of transition temperature due to the non - singularity of the crossover , which probably indicate that this phenomenon is independent of the choice of the polyakov - loop effective potential in the pnjl model . however , other effective potentials need to be developed to verify this result .",
    "the hierarchy in the pseudo - critical temperatures found in our model is consistent with the recent lattice qcd results in ref .",
    "however , @xmath103 , @xmath110 and @xmath101 found in another lattice simulation  @xcite almost coincide and there is not the hierarchy .",

    "@xcite are not in the scaling regime and the results obtained with their lattice spacings can not give a consistent continuum limit for @xmath69  @xcite . making use of the two different polyakov - loop effective potentials , we find that there is always an inflection point in the curve of strange quark number susceptibility vs temperature , accompanying the appearance of the deconfinement phase , independent of the strength of flavor - mixing interaction , which is also consistent with the results of lattice qcd simulations  @xcite .",
