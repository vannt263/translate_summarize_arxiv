    "what we do know , drawing parallels from the jordan - wigner map from hardcore bosons on ordinary chains to noninteracting spinless fermions , is that a string map from one model to another will map some products of local operators to string operators , for example , the hardcore boson @xmath449 to the spinless fermion @xmath450 , and other products of local operators to products of local operators , for example , the hardcore boson @xmath451 to the spinless fermion @xmath452 .",

    "since all the exact solutions we have obtained in this paper can ultimately be mapped to the one - dimensional fermi sea , we conjecture that all correlation exponents are universal .",
    "we claim that : ( i ) all exponents that are explicitly universal are simple rational polynomials of the single universal spinless fermi liquid parameter @xmath453 ; and ( ii ) non - universal exponents are the result of ( under)fitting linear combinations of universal power laws to a single power law . for example , in the two - leg limit , the leading universal exponent @xmath367 of the cdw@xmath360 correlation in the staggered ground state can be shown using a bosonization calculation of the string correlation it is mapped to , to follow automatically from the universal fermi liquid parameter @xmath454 @xcite .",
    "in this same limiting case , the leading universal correlation exponent @xmath455 of the sc@xmath360 correlation , which gets mapped to a significantly more complicated string correlation , can conceivably be written as the combination @xmath456 of the universal fermi liquid parameter @xmath454 , even though the bosonized form of this string correlation is not known . for the excluded chain of hardcore bosons or spinless fermions , nonlinear curve fitting of the sc correlation to the sum of one leading power - law decay and one",

    "we believe good fits can also be obtained , using similar complicated sum of power - law decays , for those numerical correlations which we found to have strongly non - universal correlation exponents .",
    "finally , we asked ourselves whether all these string correlations that we have predicted will decay with separation @xmath71 slower than the two - point function @xmath457 can be measured in a chain of noninteracting spinless fermions . since these string operators are nonlocal observables , they do not in general couple to local measurements , so direct experimental measurement would be challenging , if not downright impossible",

    "if the ground - state of the experimental system can be mapped to the one - dimensional fermi sea , we expect a measurement of the point correlation exponent in the experimental system to be an indirect measurement of the string correlation exponent in the fermi sea .",
    "on a one - dimensional chain , hardcore bosons can not move past each other , as one boson must first hop on top of the other  a move explicitly forbidden by the hardcore condition  for this to happen . for a different reason ( the pauli exclusion principle ) , but to the same effect , noninteracting spinless fermions on a one - dimensional chain can not exchange positions . therefore , in one dimension , the hardcore - boson and noninteracting - spinless - fermion hamiltonians are also identical in structure , and thus the ground state of a chain of hardcore bosons is related to the fermi - sea ground state of a chain of noninteracting spinless fermions in a simple way .",
