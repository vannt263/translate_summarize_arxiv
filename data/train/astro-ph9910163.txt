    "the combination of optical and near - infrared surveys has led to the discovery of a population of galaxies with extremely red colors ( hereafter called ergs , sometimes also called extremely red objects , eros , e.g. elston , rieke & rieke 1988 ; mccarthy et al . 1992 ; hu & ridgway 1994 ) . however , depending on the depth of the surveys and on the adopted filters , different color criteria have been used to classify a galaxy as `` extremely red '' . here",
    "we adopt a color threshold @xmath0 , which corresponds to the observed colors of cluster and field ellipticals at @xmath11 ( e.g. spinrad et al . 1997 ; rosati et al .",
    "1999 ) and to old passively evolving populations at similarly high redshifts according to the bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) spectral synthesis models . according to such models ,",
    "a color selection threshold @xmath12 is equivalent to @xmath0 in the selection of elliptical galaxy candidates at @xmath13 ( see for instance barger et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "ergs are ubiquitous objects , being found in `` empty '' sky fields ( e.g. thompson et al .",
    "1999 ) , in the vicinity of high-@xmath14 agn ( mccarthy et al . 1992 ; hu & ridgway 1994 ) and as counterparts of faint x - ray ( newsam et al . 1997 ) and radio sources ( spinrad et al . 1997 ) .",
    "very little is presently known about ergs mainly because their faintness hampers spectroscopic observations .",
    "their colors are consistent with two radically different scenarios : ( 1 ) ergs are evolved spheroidals at @xmath11 , their colors being due to the lack of star formation and to the strong k - correction , ( 2 ) ergs are high-@xmath14 active or starburst galaxies heavily reddened by dust extinction .",
    "such scenarios are relevant both to understand the formation and the evolution of elliptical galaxies and to investigate the existence of a population of dusty galaxies or agn strongly reddened by dust extinction .",
    "recent observations suggested the existence of at least two populations of objects contributing to the erg population .",
    "on the one hand , near - ir spectroscopy and submillimeter observations showed that hr10 ( @xmath15 , hu & ridgway 1994 ) is a dusty starburst galaxy at @xmath16 ( graham & dey 1996 ; cimatti et al .",
    "1998 ; dey et al .",
    "1999 ) . on the other hand",
    ", further observations suggested that other ergs are likely to be high-@xmath14 ellipticals ( e.g. spinrad et al .",
    "1997 ; stiavelli et al .",
    "1999 ; soifer et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in order to assess the relative contribution of different galaxy types to the overall erg population and their respective role in galaxy evolution , we started a project based on optical and near - ir observations made with the eso and _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) telescopes .",
    "we present here the first results of near - ir spectroscopy of a sample of ergs .",
    "@xmath17 kms@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and @xmath18 are assumed throughout the paper .",
    "we surveyed about 95 arcmin@xmath19 in high-@xmath14 agn fields and in `` empty '' sky fields ( cimatti et al . ;",
    "daddi et al .",
    "; pozzetti et al . , in preparation ) , and we selected a complete sample of ergs with @xmath1 . since homogeneous optical imaging was not always available to us for all the observed fields , we adopted a color selection threshold @xmath0 or @xmath12 depending on the available optical photometry .",
    "we do not expect contamination by low mass stars or brown dwarfs ( e.g. cuby et al .",
    "1999 ) because our color - selected ergs turned out to have non - stellar morphologies . here",
    "we present the first results for an incomplete `` pilot '' subsample that was selected according to the observability of the targets during the allocated vlt nights .",
    "@xmath20-band imaging was done on 27 - 30 march 1999 with the imager - spectrograph sofi ( moorwood , cuby & lidman 1998 ) at the eso 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 and @xmath22 images of the j2027 - 217 field ( with 10 and 14 minutes exposure respectively ) were obtained with the near - ir imager- spectrograph isaac ( moorwood et al .",
    "1999 ) at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) ut1 ( _ antu _ ) on 28 april 1999 . both sofi and isaac",
    "are equipped with 1024@xmath19 rockwell detectors with scales of 0.@xmath23292/pixel and 0.@xmath23147/ pixel respectively .",
    "the observations were made during photometric conditions and with the seeing 0.7@xmath23 - 1.0@xmath24 and 0.4@xmath23 - 0.5@xmath23 for sofi and isaac respectively . during the observations",
    "the telescope was moved between exposures according to a random pattern of offsets .",
    "the total integration times of the sofi images were 30 , 20 , 15 , 25 minutes in the @xmath20 bands respectively .",
    "the @xmath25 photometric calibration was achieved with the standard stars of persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and feige 56 and ltt 3864 ( hamuy et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the night - to - night scatter of the zero points was about 0.02 magnitudes .",
    "basic information on the optical photometry can be found in the captions of fig .",
    "1 and 2 , and more details will be given in forthcoming papers .",
    "photometry was carried out with sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) using a 3@xmath23 diameter aperture and taking into account aperture losses due to the different seeing conditions .",
    "the magnitudes were dereddened for galactic extinction using the maps of burnstein & heiles ( 1982 ) .",
    "the results in sections 3.2 and 3.3 do not change if dereddening is made with the schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) dust maps .",
    "@xmath26-band spectroscopy was obtained with isaac at the eso vlt - ut1 ( _ antu _ ) on 25 - 27 april 1999 in photometric and 0.5@xmath23 - 1.0@xmath27 seeing conditions .",
    "the slit was 1@xmath23 wide , providing a spectral resolution fwhm of @xmath28 24   , 32     and 48     in @xmath29- , @xmath21- , and @xmath30-band respectively .",
    "the observations were done by nodding the target along the slit between two positions a and b with a nod throw of 10@xmath23 .",
    "the integration time per position was 10 minutes .",
    "for instance , a total integration time of 1 hour was obtained following a pattern abbaab . when possible , two targets were observed simultaneously in the slit .",
    "the spectral frames were flat - fielded , rectified , sky - subtracted , coadded and divided by the response curve obtained using the spectra of o7-o8 stars .",

    "continuum emission was detected in all the targets .",
    "however , neither strong emission lines nor evident continuum breaks were detected in the isaac spectra .",
    "the absence of emission lines favours these ergs being high-@xmath14 ellipticals , although this does not prove it . in case of elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the absence of the 4000     continuum break in the observed @xmath29-band spectra contrains the redshifts to be at @xmath42 .",
    "the possibility that h@xmath37 emission falls in the `` blind '' region between @xmath29 and @xmath21 bands ( for 1.1@xmath431.2 ) with [ oiii]@xmath395007 not yet entered in the @xmath29 band , seems unlikely to occur for all the targets .",
    "the upper limits for the flux of emission lines are rather similar for all the spectra .",
    "however , each spectrum shows a variation of this limit as a function of wavelength because of the enhanced noise in regions corresponding to bright sky emission lines .",
    "the deepest limits are @xmath21.0@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath44 50   , increasing by a factor of @xmath45 in the parts of the spectra most contaminated by sky line residuals .",
    "due to its fainter and noisier spectra , the exception is j100544 - 0742.2 which has @xmath24.5@xmath3 erg s@xmath4@xmath5 and @xmath23.5@xmath3 erg s@xmath4@xmath5 in @xmath29 and @xmath21 , respectively . with the exception of j100544 - 0742.2 , our spectra would allow to significantly detect emission lines such as the h@xmath37 observed in hr10 ( dey et al .",
    "1999 ) , or in a major fraction of the h@xmath37 emitters at @xmath46 discovered by mccarthy et al .",

    ", we attempted to estimate what we call the `` spectro - photometric '' redshifts ( @xmath47 ) by using the isaac continuum spectrophotometry together with the available broad- band photometry in order to derive the global optical to near - ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the observed ergs .",
    "the resulting seds were then fitted by means of a @xmath48 comparison with a set of 240 bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) synthetic templates : 80 simple stellar population ( ssp ) spectra with @xmath49 , 80 with constant star formation ( csf ) and @xmath49 , and 80 ssp spectra with @xmath50 .",
    "the template spectra have salpeter imf ( 0.1@xmath51m@xmath52 125 ) and ages from 0.1 myr to 10 gyr .",
    "such a set of templates was chosen in order to encompass a wide range of galaxy seds spanning from young starbursts to old ellipticals with super - solar metallicity .",
    "the dust extinction was treated as a free parameter adopting the calzetti ( 1997 ) extinction law with @xmath53=0.0 - 1.0 .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath21 spectra of j100544 - 0742.2 were not used in the fitting analysis because too noisy .    during the fitting analysis",
    ", the isaac @xmath26 spectra were first cleaned by excluding the edge regions and , in the @xmath21-band , the regions corresponding to the four strongest sky emission lines .",
    "the isaac spectra were then binned to 800     wide bins in order to balance the relative contribution of spectrophotometry and broad - band photometry during the fitting analysis , and , at the same time , to conserve the spectral information ( i.e. the slope of the spectra ) .",
    "broad - band @xmath54 photometric points were not used during the fitting if corresponding near - ir spectra were available . the @xmath47 shown in tab",
    "1 are relative to the best absolute fit .",
    "the formal 1@xmath55 uncertainties on the redshifts , estimated with the @xmath56 method ( avni 1976 ) , are @xmath57 ( see tab.1 ) .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show that a good agreement between the observed and the model spectra is generally achieved . in the case of j100551 - 0742.4",
    ", the absence of an observed 4000     break in the @xmath29-band spectrum constrains @xmath58 , whereas the broad - band photometry would allow to derive formally acceptable redshifts up to @xmath59 .      according to the results of the fitting analysis",
    ", we attempted to preliminarly divide the observed ergs into two classes at a 95% confidence level .    _",
    "( a ) _ galaxies with seds that can be reproduced by evolved stellar population spectra without dust extinction . 6 ergs fall into this class ( see fig . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that these galaxies are dustless , but it only means that their seds are consistent with those expected for passively evolved high-@xmath14 ellipticals with no dust extinction , old ages ( @xmath60 gyr ) and metallicity up to @xmath61 .",
    "however , because of the degeneracy between ages and dust extinction , acceptable fits can be found also with younger stellar populations and @xmath62 .",
    "thus , we can summarize saying that _ at most _ 6 ergs of our sample can be high-@xmath14 ellipticals .",
    "in such a case , their rest - frame @xmath30-band absolute magnitudes ( @xmath63 - 24.4@xmath64 - 25.0 ) imply luminosities @xmath65 ( adopting @xmath66=-25.16 for the local luminosity function of elliptical galaxies ; marzke et al .",
    "1998 ) , and their stellar masses are intermediate ( m@xmath67 m@xmath9 ) .",
    "_ ( b ) _ galaxies with seds that require significant dust extinction .",
    "two ergs are present in this group : j100544 - 0742.2 and j124027 - 1131.0 . their sed fitting is characterized by a large degree of degeneracy among spectral templates , ages and amount of dust reddening .",
    "nevertheless , the minimum amount of dust extinction required to provide acceptable fits ( @xmath68 ) suggests that these two ergs are systems affected by strong dust reddening .",
    "a third galaxy , j202807 - 2141.1 , falls formally into this class because an acceptable fit is obtained only with @xmath69 , with an age of @xmath700.7 gyr and with @xmath61 .",
    "however , we consider this case ambiguous because of the unusual set of parameters provided by the fit .",
    "deep submillimeter continuum observations will help to establish if these three dusty ergs are hr10-like objects ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "hst wfpc2 deep imaging is available from the public archive only for three of the observed ergs ( see tab .",
    "the @xmath36-band morphologies strengthen the indications given by the sed fitting analysis : j100544 - 0742.2 has an extended , irregular and disturbed morphology consistent with being a dusty starburst galaxy ; j100551 - 0742.4 has a compact and elliptical - like morphology . the case of j124027 - 1131.0",
    "is more ambiguous because its morphology is compact and weakly disturbed .",
    "adopting @xmath71 , for each object we estimated the limits on the h@xmath37 luminosity @xmath72h@xmath73 and on the star formation rate ( @xmath74 ) through the relation @xmath75h@xmath73 [ m@xmath9 yr@xmath4 ] ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "this was not possible for j202807 - 2141.1 and j202807 - 2140.8 because no @xmath29 spectra were available to us .",
    "we find limits in the range of @xmath72h@xmath77 erg s@xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath78@xmath8m@xmath9 yr@xmath4 ( table 1 ) .",
    "taken at face value , these limits imply star formation rates at most as high as those of nearby gas rich spiral galaxies ( see kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "however , in case of dust extinction , such sfrs would increase by a factor of @xmath70230@xmath79 for @xmath80 0.20.9 .",
    "finally , we noticed that the four ergs in the j2027 - 217 field have all very similar @xmath47 ( fig.2 ) , and may belong to a same cluster or group .",
    "our observations showed that neither strong emission lines nor continuum breaks are detected in the isaac spectra of 9 ergs , and that only a fraction of them ( 2 - 3 out of 9 in our subsample ) require strong dust reddening to reproduce their seds . on the other hand ,",
    "up to 6 ergs have properties that are formally consistent with the strict definition of being dustless , old and passively evolved spheroidals at @xmath11 and with @xmath81 .",
    "although the observed sample is rather small and still incomplete , it is tempting to speculate on how the above results may have implications on the problem of the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "in fact , the existence and the abundance of high-@xmath14 ellipticals is one of the most controversial issues of galaxy evolution .",
    "some works claimed that the number of galaxies with the red colors expected for high-@xmath14 passively evolved spheroidals is lower compared to the predictions of passive luminosity evolution ( e.g. kauffmann , charlot & white 1996 ; zepf 1997 ; franceschini et al . 1998 ; barger et al .",
    "however , other works did not confirm the existence of such a deficit up to @xmath82 ( e.g. totani & yoshii 1997 ; benitez et al .",
    "1999 ; broadhurst & bowens 1999 ; schade et al .",
    "this picture is complicated by the possibility that such spheroidals are bluer because of a low level of residual star formation , thus escaping the selection criteria based on red colors ( e.g. jimenez et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "thus , it is clear that a reliable comparison between the observed abundance of high-@xmath14 ellipticals and the one expected from the various galaxy formation models can be performed only if the fraction of high-@xmath14 ellipticals in erg samples is firmly established .",
    "if taken at face value , our analysis suggests that a substantial fraction of ergs are consistent with being _ bona fide _",
    ". should spectroscopy of complete and larger samples confirm such result , this would allow a reliable comparison of the observed and predicted numbers of spheroidals at @xmath11 .",
    "we are grateful to jean - gabriel cuby , chris lidman and leonardo vanzi for their invaluable help during the observations , and to gustavo bruzual and stephane charlot for providing their synthetic spectral library .",
    "we also thank the referee , massimo stiavelli , for his constructive criticism .",
