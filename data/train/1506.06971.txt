    "from the perspective of local stability analysis , if an ecosystem is close to a stable equilibrium point then the effect of a small perturbation , such as the loss of individuals from a population , will eventually decay and the system will return to its original equilibrium point  @xcite .",
    "but if the ecosystem is at an unstable equilibrium point then the perturbation will lead to the system settling at a new equilibrium point , possibly with fewer individuals or even species  @xcite . in theory ,",
    "ecosystems with large numbers of species and interactions are more difficult to stabilise  @xcite .",
    "however , many ecosystems contain vast biodiversity  @xcite . reconciling this finding with",
    "local stability analysis has motivated ecologists for over 40 years  @xcite .",
    "recently , stability criteria were extended from randomly assembled communities to include those with more realistic compositions of mutualistic , competitive and predator - prey interactions  @xcite .",
    "these criteria showed that communities in which predator - prey interactions dominate are more likely to be stable .",
    "it was then shown , using empirical food webs , that the distribution and correlation of interaction strengths has a greater effect on stability than topology : how species interact with one another is more important than who they interact with  @xcite .",
    "stability is a long - term concept : it indicates whether a system will , at some point in the future , return to the same state as before a perturbation  @xcite .",
    "reactivity , on the other hand , indicates how a system will respond immediately after a perturbation has been applied  @xcite .",
    "a stable system can be non - reactive , meaning that a perturbation to species abundances dies down immediately , or reactive , meaning that a perturbation is first amplified before eventually decaying ( whether a particular perturbation is amplified in practice depends on which species are perturbed and by how much  @xcite ) .",
    "reactivity criteria for large ecosystems show that communities on the verge of instability exhibit reactive dynamics  @xcite , and identifying a system as reactive has been proposed as an early - warning signal for population collapse  @xcite .",
    "the starting point for deriving criteria for both stability and reactivity is the community matrix  @xcite .",
    "a spectral decomposition of the community matrix provides information on the asymptotic behaviour of the system for stability ( @xmath0 ) and reactivity ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "but so far , little information has been extracted from the community matrix regarding transient dynamics : how the system evolves after a perturbation and before it either returns to equilibrium or becomes unstable  @xcite .",
    "reactive dynamics are not possible if the community matrix @xmath2 is normal , i.e. , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the adjoint of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "but if @xmath2 is a non - normal matrix , as is usually the case in analyses of realistic ecosystems , then transient dynamics may substantially differ from the asymptotic behaviour suggested by the eigenvalues of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , small changes to the entries of non - normal @xmath2 can cause an otherwise stable matrix to become unstable  @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the dynamics implied by non - normal matrices are better described by pseudospectra , which detail the neighbourhood of eigenvalues in the complex plane for different average changes to the entries in @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "here we formalise the transition from stability to instability in terms of pseudospectra . using this approach",
    ", we consider the effect on dynamics of two kinds of perturbation : more commonly studied perturbations to the equilibrium abundance of species ( to the population vector ) and less commonly studied perturbations to the entries in @xmath2 ( which could be interpreted as uncertainty in , or small changes to , species interaction strengths  @xcite ) .",
    "we describe critical values for community properties separating three regimes : stable and non - reactive dynamics , stable and reactive dynamics`transient instability'and unstable dynamics .",
    "we show that system dynamics at the boundary between non - reactive stability and transient instability can be affected by perturbations to entries of the community matrix . and , given a perturbation to the equilibrium abundance of species , we provide upper and lower bounds to the maximum amplification of such perturbations during transient instability .",
    "this allows us to sketch out the transient dynamics of complex ecosystems using only information from the community matrix .",
    "finally , we compare the properties of community matrices representing ecological communities with five different types of interaction structure : random , mutualism , competition , mixture of mutualism and competition , and predator - prey .",
    "here we consider an ecological community of @xmath5 species for which their population densities at time @xmath6 are given by the vector @xmath7 , as in tang & allesina  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the population vector @xmath8 can be described by a system of coupled differential equations @xmath9 where @xmath10^t$ ] is a vector of linear or nonlinear functions .",
    "an ecologically - relevant equilibrium point is a non - negative vector * y * * such that @xmath11 the community matrix @xmath2 is defined as @xmath12 which is the jacobian matrix evaluated at an equilibrium point  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that an equilibrium point is ( locally and asymptotically ) stable if any infinitesimally small deviation , @xmath13 , eventually decays to zero , i.e. , @xmath14  @xcite . in the vicinity of an equilibrium point",
    ", the time evolution of a perturbation can be described by @xmath15 therefore , the spectrum of the community matrix @xmath2 is clearly relevant for determining local stability .",
    "if @xmath16*m*@xmath17 is the set of eigenvalues of @xmath2 , then an equilibrium point is stable if all eigenvalues have negative real part , i.e. , @xmath18   @xcite .",
    "we parameterise community matrices using four quantities : @xmath5 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; where @xmath5 , as above , is the number of species , @xmath19 is the connectance ( the fraction of realised interactions among species ) , @xmath20 is the strength of intraspecific interactions and @xmath21 is the standard deviation of the strength of interspecific interactions  @xcite .",
    "we assume that populations are self - regulating and so @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "non - normal community matrices with different types of interaction  representing different types of ecological community  are generated by sampling off - diagonal entries ( @xmath24 , interspecific interactions ) from different bivariate distributions .",
    "having specified a particular distribution , stability criteria can be expressed in terms of @xmath5 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . based on these criteria , it has been shown that predator - prey community matrices are the most stable , followed by random , competition , mixture and mutualism  @xcite .",
    "generative models for these community matrices are described below .",

    "these community matrices have a @xmath34 or @xmath35 sign structure for off - diagonal pairs .",
    "in general , the eigenvalues of @xmath2 satisfy the following definition : @xmath36 meaning that if @xmath37 is an eigenvalue of @xmath2 then by convention the norm of @xmath38 is defined to be infinity ( see chapter  @xmath39 in  @xcite ) .",
    "but if @xmath40 is finite and very large , as is often the case with perturbed non - normal matrices , then the pseudospectrum of @xmath2 must be considered .",
    "the ` @xmath41-pseudospectrum ' has several equivalent definitions that describe the eigenvalues of a matrix whose entries have been subject to noise of magnitude @xmath41 ( in the sense of the matrix norm )  @xcite .",
    "we use the following definition : @xmath42 if a matrix is normal then its @xmath41-pseudospectrum ( henceforth just ` pseudospectrum ' ) consists of closed balls of radius @xmath41 surrounding the original eigenvalues of @xmath2 ( see theorem  2.2 in  @xcite ) . as mentioned earlier , normal matrices can not exhibit reactive dynamics : perturbations of the population vector for a stable system decay immediately and with exponential profile as the system returns to its original equilibrium point .",
    "but with non - normal matrices , pseudospectra can be much larger and more intricate and reactive dynamics are possible : perturbations of the population vector for a stable system first increase in magnitude and reach a maximum amplitude before eventually decaying ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this behaviour motivates a description of local stability analysis for community matrices in terms of pseudospectra .    , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which is asymptotically stable .",
    "contours in the complex plane illustrate the effect on eigenvalues of the community matrix @xmath2 for noise of magnitude @xmath46  @xcite . the contour for @xmath47 crosses the imaginary axis , implying that the pseudospectral abscissa is positive and so transient instability is observable . _",

    "local asymptotic stability is determined in the same way for normal and non - normal matrices .",
    "the ` spectral abscissa ' of @xmath2 is defined as @xmath50 where the supremum ( sup ) selects for the largest ( real - part ) of the rightmost eigenvalue in the set @xmath51 .",
    "stability is guaranteed for @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath2 is normal , then @xmath53 and dynamics are completely described by @xmath54 ( see eqn  [ timeevo ] ) .",
    "otherwise , the dynamics implied by @xmath2 can be more complicated : @xmath55 where the columns of matrix @xmath56 are the eigenvectors of * m * , and @xmath57 is known as the conditioning of @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "the conditioning provides a bound from above  an upper bound  to the maximum amplitude of a perturbation of the population vector ( it is worth noting that @xmath58 does not provide any information about the time at which the perturbation reaches its maximum amplitude ) .    in complement",
    "to stability is reactivity , which describes the behaviour of a system close to @xmath59 , at the application of a perturbation .",
    "the ` numerical abscissa ' of @xmath2 is defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the numerical abscissa is the maximum initial amplification rate following an infinitesimally small perturbation to the population vector .",
    "dynamics are non - reactive if @xmath62 and may be reactive if @xmath63 . a stable system can be either reactive or non - reactive , but an unstable system is necessarily reactive",
    ".    with non - normal matrices , perturbations to the entries of @xmath2 can affect whether a system is stable and non - reactive or stable and reactive .",
    "in other words , perturbations to the entries of * m * can affect how a system responds to perturbations to the population vector .",
    "the effect of such perturbations to * m * is not covered by eqn  [ eqn : numabscissa ] .",
    "however , we can study the pseudospectrum of a community matrix to better understand system dynamics between the limits of reactivity and stability . in what follows ,",
    "we use the theory of pseudospectra to relate uncertainty in , or small changes to , the entries of @xmath2 to bounds on the amplification of perturbations of the population vector .",
    "the ` @xmath41-pseudospectral abscissa ' of @xmath2 is defined as @xmath64 which is the largest real - part eigenvalue of the pseudospectrum of @xmath2 for a given amount of noise @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath41-pseudospectral abscissa provides a lower bound to the maximum amplification of a perturbation of the population vector ( see eqn  14.6  in  @xcite ) : @xmath65 and therefore the function @xmath66 is useful for understanding transient dynamics  @xcite . in the literature on pseudospectra , @xmath67 is known as the kreiss constant  @xcite .",
    "eqns  [ eqn : pseudodef ] ,  [ eqn : lowerbound ]  and  [ eqn : fm ]  are useful because they relate perturbations to the matrix norm  small changes to the elements of the community matrix as described by the noise parameter @xmath41to the effect of perturbations to the population vector ( compare eqns  [ eqn : specab ]  and  [ eqn : pseudodef ] ) .",
    "for a given community matrix , as the size of a _ matrix _ perturbation is increased from zero there may be some critical value @xmath68 at which @xmath69 . in the pseudospectrum ,",
    "this is illustrated by the @xmath68-contour crossing the imaginary axis ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "at this point , perturbations to the equilibrium population vector begin to be amplified .    for a stable and non - reactive system , perturbations to the population vector are not amplified and the system always returns to its original equilibrium point . for an unstable and necessarily reactive system ,",
    "perturbations are amplified and the system may move to a new equilibrium point .",
    "but for a stable and reactive system , perturbations are first amplified before the system eventually returns to its original equilibrium point  this is transient instability . now",

    "we found an early , sharp and severe transition between stability and instability with mutualism , mixture and competition , but a later , longer and less severe transition with predator - prey community matrices .    in this study , we assumed a random topology of interactions between species .",
    "although the correlation between interaction strengths  and therefore the predominant type of interaction in a community matrix  may be more important than topology for stability  @xcite , it remains to be seen whether this is the case with transient instability .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that the particular trajectory of a perturbed system is sensitive to topology , and , of course , the _ direction _ of initial perturbation of the population vector .",
    "understanding transient dynamics at this level of detail requires analysis of pseudoeigenvectors in addition to pseudoeigenvalues  ( see chapter  @xmath113 in  @xcite ) .",

    ". it will be informative to compare how the time evolution of the same shock to the same system is assessed under different approaches to measuring the ` stability ' , ` persistence ' or ` resilience ' of ecosystems  @xcite .",
    "stability , in principle , promises a degree of certainty that biodiversity will not be lost  @xcite .",
    "reactivity has been suggested as a possible early - warning signal for the onset of instability  @xcite .",
    "transient instability not only fills the gap between these two concepts , but also highlights new consequences of rapid environmental change .",
    "the longer the period of transient instability and the larger the amplification of perturbations of the population vector , the more susceptible an ecosystem is to multiple perturbations .",
    "one perturbation may drive a stable system into a period of transient instability that eventually dissipates ; but two or three perturbations in quick succession may force the system to a new , unknown equilibrium point that may correspond to a loss of species and biodiversity .",

    "<S> the jacobian matrix evaluated at an equilibrium point is known as the community matrix , which describes the population dynamics of interacting species . </S>",
    "<S> a system s asymptotic short- and long - term behaviour can be determined from eigenvalues derived from the community matrix . </S>",
    "<S> here we use results from the theory of pseudospectra to describe intermediate , transient dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we first recover the established result that the transition from stable to unstable dynamics includes a region of ` transient instability ' , where the effect of a small perturbation to species abundances  to the population vector  is amplified before ultimately decaying . </S>",
    "<S> then we show that the shift from stability to transient instability can be affected by uncertainty in , or small changes to , entries in the community matrix , and determine lower and upper bounds to the maximum amplitude of perturbations to the population vector . </S>",
    "<S> of five different types of community matrix , we find that amplification is least severe when predator - prey interactions dominate . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is relevant to other systems whose dynamics can be expressed in terms of the jacobian matrix . </S>",
    "<S> our results will lead to improved understanding of how multiple perturbations to a complex system may irrecoverably break stability . </S>"
