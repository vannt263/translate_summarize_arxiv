    "bistability and hysteresis are commonly observed in physics , chemistry and biology @xcite .",
    "let us assume that a system has two stable states @xmath0 and @xmath1 and that an increase in the value of control parameter @xmath2 above the threshold @xmath3 triggers the transition from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , whereas the reverse transition from @xmath1 to @xmath0 occurs if the value of the control parameter drops below @xmath4 .",
    "such a system can obviously be used as a discriminator of the control parameter value .",
    "for example , if the initial state is @xmath0 and after some time we observe the system in @xmath1 , then at some point the value of the control parameter necessarily exceeded @xmath3 .",
    "however , if only time - monotonic changes in the value of the control parameter are considered , then the system discrimination ability is reduced to just two values ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the suitability of a dynamical system characterized by sigmoidal kinetics for discrimination - oriented applications , under a new strategy of imposing a periodic perturbation or input on a cooperative system .",
    "it has been reported @xcite that periodic perturbations can significantly change the time evolution of a nonlinear system . as a discriminator prototype ,",
    "we consider a two - variable system in which the inflow of one of the variables is a control parameter .",
    "numerical simulations reveal a non - trivial property of such a system : a marginal change in the inflow parameters ( amplitude or frequency ) can switch the response of a cooperative system between different branches in the stage diagram .",
    "the frequency at which such switching occurs is a monotonic function of the inflow amplitude .",
    "therefore , at a fixed amplitude of periodic inflow , the observation of a transition between different types of oscillatory evolution of the system provides information which allows us to discriminate the inflow frequency .",
    "the above discussion does not necessarily limit the range of frequencies that can be discriminated by the observation of transitions between different types of oscillations similarly , for a fixed frequency of periodic inflow , transitions between different types of system oscillations occur within a narrow range of amplitudes .",
    "the transition can be used to discriminate the inflow amplitude , but for the model considered here , the useful range of such discrimination is rather limited .    in numerical simulations ,",
    "we consider simple system dynamics defined by a single sigmoidal term expressed by a rational function , which is typical for enzymatic reactions @xcite . in such reactions",
    "the appearance of sigmoidal kinetic behavior is usually interpreted to be the result of the interaction of substrates with enzymes through positive cooperative binding .",
    "modeling of cooperative binding leads to the hill equation @xcite : @xmath5^n}{k_d + [ l]^n } \\label{hill}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the fraction of ligand binding sites filled , @xmath7 $ ] is the ligand concentration , @xmath8 is the apparent dissociation constant derived from the mass action law , and @xmath9 is the hill coefficient which represents the degree of cooperativity .",
    "if @xmath10 , there is no cooperativity ; for @xmath11 , the cooperativity is positive .",
    "kinetics with sigmoidal behavior are not limited to enzymatic reactions .",
    "this also describes the response of various biological systems to external stimuli , including the effect of drug delivery , which is an interesting topic in pharmacology . among the many experimental studies that have reported sigmoidal behavior , the hill coefficient @xmath9 usually has a value between 2 and 4 @xcite .",
    "here we selected @xmath9 = 3 for the numerical simulations presented below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we consider a bistable model and study its time evolution as a function of the amplitude and frequency of periodic inflow .",
    "we demonstrate how the system can be used as a discriminator and discuss the sources of discrimination errors . in the final section",
    "we argue that the observed phenomenon is generic and discuss its potential applications .",
    "let us consider a dynamical system of two variables @xmath12 , @xmath13 defined by a set of differential equations : @xmath14 @xmath15 in eq.([r1 ] ) , the last term @xmath16 describes a periodic inflow of @xmath17 with frequency @xmath18 and initial ( for @xmath19 ) phase @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the heaviside step function .",
    "we assume that the there is no inflow for @xmath22 , and it is switched on at @xmath19 . if @xmath23 , then @xmath24 is a continuous function . in this case , @xmath25 .",
    "it then increases and finally oscillates . for any other phase ,",
    "the inflow term is not continuous at @xmath19 ; for example , if @xmath26 and then @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath24 then decreases and finally oscillates .",
    "the inflow term is always non - negative .",
    "for @xmath28 the time average of @xmath29 equals @xmath30 and is independent of the frequency and the initial phase . if the inflow amplitude @xmath31 , then @xmath32 is the only steady state of eqs.([r1],[r2 ] ) and is stable . in the following analysis",
    ", we assume that the stable state of the system without flow is the initial state for the simulated evolution .",
    "initially , let us consider the time evolution of the system for a constant inflow @xmath33 for @xmath34 ( thus , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "the characteristics of the time evolution depend on the amplitude of the inflow term and on the initial state . in this case",
    ", the nullcline @xmath37 is the time - independent line with a definite slope determined by the value of @xmath38 and a shift which depends on the inflow amplitude @xmath30 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the location of nullclines , calculated for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and a few different values of the inflow .",
    "let us assume that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the amplitudes for which the bn @xmath43 nullcline is tangential to the sigmoidal - shaped nullcline @xmath44 .",
    "the stable stationary states of the system can be located on two branches on the @xmath44 nullcline .",
    "one contains all of the points of the @xmath44 nullcline located between point @xmath45 and the tangency point @xmath46",
    ". we will call it the lower stable branch ( lsb ) .",
    "the other is the upper stable branch ( usb ) , and is formed by all of the points of the @xmath44 nullcline located above @xmath47 .",
    "the stationary states located on the nullcline between @xmath46 and @xmath47 are unstable . in the case",
    "when @xmath48 , the only stationary state is located on the lower stable branch , so the system converges to the stable state @xmath49 such that @xmath50 regardless of the initial state .",
    "similarly , for @xmath51 , the single bn stationary state is located on the upper stable branch , and for all initial states the system converges to the stable state @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 , the stationary state that is approached for @xmath54 depends on the initial state and on the partition of the phase space determined by the separatrices of the saddle point which is located on the middle branch of the @xmath55 nullcline .",
    "this analysis also applies when the frequency of inflow oscillations is very high . in such a case ,",
    "the flow oscillations are much faster than both the system dynamics and the system responses to the time - averaged value of the inflow @xmath30 .    for sufficiently slow oscillations of the inflow ( @xmath56 ) , the system can follow the slowly relocating stable state ,",
    "the position of which varies according to the instantaneous value of the inflow .",
    "if the initial state of the system is @xmath57 and @xmath58 , then @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the system state oscillates along the lower stable branch of the @xmath61 nullcline with the period defined by the frequency of inflow oscillations . if @xmath62 , then there are intervals of time within which the system has a single stationary state located on the upper stable branch . during a single oscillation cycle , there are moments of time @xmath63 and @xmath64 at which @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and thus oscillations that extend over both stable branches are expected .    for moderate values of @xmath18 ,",
    "the system dynamics are too slow to closely follow the changes in the inflow value . in such a case , oscillations around a stable state located in the lower stable branch that extend to the unstable branch , as well as oscillations around a stable state located in the upper stable branch that extend to the unstable branch , should be observed .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "the complexity of oscillations observed for a constant inflow amplitude @xmath67 ( thus @xmath68 but @xmath69 ) as a function of flow frequency is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . as discussed above , for the selected amplitude and a low frequency of inflow oscillations ,",
    "the system dynamics follow the time - dependent stationary state and oscillations of @xmath70 extend over both stable branches of the @xmath61 nullcline . for intermediate frequencies ,",
    "oscillations accumulate on the upper stable branch of the nullcline and the minimum value of @xmath70 increases with frequency .",
    "then , at a certain frequency @xmath71 ( for the selected amplitude of oscillations , @xmath72 ) , the oscillations switch from the upper to the lower stable branch of the @xmath61 nullcline .",
    "the transition between oscillations located on different stable branches is quite pronounced and should be easily detected in experiments with a system exhibiting hysteresis .",
    "therefore , it becomes apparent that a cooperative system can discriminate the frequency of a perturbation if its amplitude remains fixed .",
    "numerical simulations have also demonstrated that the frequency of the transition between oscillations on the usb and lsb depends on the phase @xmath73 .",
    "the right upper corner of fig .",
    "2 shows two types of oscillations that are observed for @xmath74 . if @xmath75 , the system oscillates at the upper stable branch , but if @xmath76 , oscillations around the lower stable branch are seen .",
    "fortunately for the application of this approach to discrimination , the interval of frequencies within which phase - dependent evolution is observed is very narrow . for @xmath67 ,",
    "it is @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the width of this interval ( @xmath78 ) defines the precision in frequency discrimination .    the dynamical system considered here",
    "can also be used to discriminate the amplitude of an applied perturbation .",
    "figure 3 shows the time evolution of @xmath70 for a few values of perturbation amplitude @xmath30 and a fixed inflow frequency ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "as expected , for small amplitudes ( @xmath80 ) the oscillations of @xmath70 are limited to the lsb . for larger amplitudes ( @xmath81 ) ,",
    "the range of observed values of @xmath70 increases , but the oscillations are still anchored on the lsb . finally , if @xmath82 , the oscillations move onto the usb .",
    "the transition between the different types of oscillation is quite pronounced and can be used to discriminate the value of amplitude . here ,",
    "similar to the cases illustrated in fig .",
