    "while the number of known brown dwarfs is growing rapidly , the origin of these objects is an unanswered question .",
    "one insight into the formation mechanism(s ) for brown dwarfs is whether young substellar objects possess circumstellar disks .",
    "there is abundant observational evidence and theoretical expectation for accretion disks around young solar - type stars .",
    "thus , the presence of disks around young brown dwarfs would be naturally accommodated in `` star - like '' formation scenarios . on the other hand , scenarios involving dynamical interactions",
    "( e.g. , collisions and/or ejections ) are likely to be hostile to circumstellar disks .",
    "evidence for circumstellar disks around individual young ( few  myr ) brown dwarfs has recently been found , from h@xmath1 emission , near - ir excesses , and mid - ir detections .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine the _ frequency _ of disks around brown dwarfs from studies to date due to a combination of small number statistics , sample selection inhomogeneity , and , most importantly , choice of wavelength . a priori",
    ", brown dwarf disks are expected to be harder to detect than disks around stars because of lower contrast .",
    "substellar objects are less luminous and have shallower gravitational potentials ; hence , the inner regions of their disks are likely to be cooler and thus could have negligible excesses in the @xmath2 ( 1.1@xmath32.4  ) bands , which have been used by most previous studies .",
    "we have recently completed a large @xmath4-band ( 3.8  ) survey to study the frequency and properties of disks around young brown dwarfs and very low mass stars ( liu , najita , & tokunaga 2002 ) .",
    "disks can be readily identified by excess @xmath4-band emission , which arises from warm material within a few stellar radii ( @xmath50.1  au ) .",
    "in addition , our survey is sensitive enough to detect young brown dwarf photospheres , and hence the absence of a disk can be discerned .",
    "our sample comprises nearly all the published sources in taurus and ic  348 which have been _ spectroscopically classified _ to be very cool , with spectral types from m6 to m9.5 , corresponding to masses of @xmath615 to @xmath6100  @xmath7 based on current models . by focusing on targets with spectral types , we are more sensitive to small ir excesses since we can determine the intrinsic photospheric colors .",
    "our selection criterion also ensures that we are targeting very low mass members , lying near or below the stellar / substellar mass boundary ( c.f .",

    "colors as a function of spectral type for our sample .",
    "typical errors in the spectral type are @xmath00.5 subclasses .",
    "the heavy line represents the colors of field m  dwarfs .",
    "most of the objects show intrinsic ir emission in excess of that expected from their bare photospheres .",
    "approximate mass estimates are listed at the top.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] -3ex    figure  1 shows the dereddened @xmath8 ( 2.0@xmath34.1  ) colors of our sample compared to field ( old , diskless ) m  dwarfs .",
    "most objects have colors which are redder than those expected from their bare photospheres , i.e. , they possess ir excesses . also , the lower envelope of the observed color distribution agrees well with the heavy line , indicating that field m  dwarfs provide a legitimate comparison .",
    "the disk frequency appears to be independent of mass ; however , some objects , including the very coolest ( lowest mass ) ones , lack ir excesses .",
    "we find an excess frequency of @xmath075% for the sample as a whole  disks around young brown dwarfs and vlm stars appear to be very common .",
    "the disk fraction in our sample is comparable to the disk fraction for t  tauri stars in the same star - forming regions ( e.g. , strom et  al .",
    "1989 , haisch et  al .",
    "@xmath9 h@xmath1 emission : _ for t  tauri stars , both the optical line emission and the ir excesses are believed to originate from disk accretion .",
    "the ir excesses come from warm dust grains in the disk , while h@xmath1 emission arises from accretion of disk material onto the central star .",
    "therefore , the h@xmath1 emission and ir excesses should be correlated , and indeed such a correlation is seen among t  tauri stars ( e.g. , kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows a comparison for our sample , using h@xmath1 data from the literature .",
    "a 3@xmath10 correlation is observed between the intrinsic @xmath8 excess and h@xmath1 emission , based on the spearman rank correlation coefficient .",
    "this level of correlation is comparable to that observed for t  tauri stars and provides strong circumstantial evidence for accretion disks around young brown dwarfs .",
    "furthermore , the mere existence of accreting brown dwarfs at ages of a few myr argues for mass - dependent accretion rates , since brown dwarfs with typical t  tauri star accretion rates would not remain substellar .",
    "excess and h@xmath1 equivalent width in angstroms for most of our sample .",
    "the two quantities are well - correlated , supporting the idea that the optical and near - ir emission both originate from the same phenomenon , namely circumstellar accretion disks.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] -3ex    _ @xmath9 finding stellar and substellar disks : _ the most common method for measuring the disk fraction of t  tauri stars uses color - color diagrams based on @xmath2 , or preferably @xmath11 , colors",
    ". objects with disks are identified as those having colors distinct from reddened dwarf and giant stars .",
    "this method is appealing since only photometry is required .",
    "figure  3 illustrates this method as applied to our sample . from this diagram",
    ", one would identify only @xmath01/3 of the objects as having ir excesses .",
    "however , our analysis which incorporates the objects spectral types shows that in fact the majority of sources with disks are missed in the color - color diagram because their excesses are modest .",
    "the reason why the conventional analysis works poorly is because of decreased contrast between brown dwarfs and their disks , as compared to the case of t  tauri stars .",
    "because brown dwarfs are less luminous than the higher mass t  tauri stars , passive disks around brown dwarfs will be cooler and less luminous .",
    "therefore , the corresponding ir excesses will be smaller .",
    "this physical intuition is verified with simple disk models ( see liu et  al .",
    "2002 for details ) .    _",
    "@xmath9 implications : _ we find that ( 1 )  disks around brown dwarfs are common , and ( 2 )  brown dwarf disks are contemporaneous with disks around t  tauri stars in the same star - forming regions .",
    "the latter also shows that brown dwarf disks are at least as long - lived as disks around stars , assuming that the stars and brown dwarfs are roughly coeval .",
    "these observations are naturally accommodated in a picture where brown dwarfs form in a similar manner as stars  our results offer prima facie evidence for a common origin for objects from the stellar regime down to the substellar and planetary - mass regime .",
    "alternative formation scenarios , such as disk - disk collisions and/or premature ejection , involve dynamical interactions in creating brown dwarfs .",
    "while specific predictions are lacking due to the stochastic nature of these scenarios , brown dwarfs formed by these mechanisms are generally expected to have smaller and less massive disks , and consequently shorter disk lifetimes , compared to brown dwarfs formed in isolation .",
    "this expectation conflicts with our finding that brown dwarf disks are at least as long - lived as disks around young stars .",
