    "since the late 80 s there has being an increasing interest in ultrathin magnetic films @xcite .",
    "this interest is mainly associated to the development of magnetic - non - magnetic multilayers for the purpose of giant magnetoresistence applications @xcite .",
    "in addition , experiments on epitaxial magnetic layers have shown that a huge variety of complex structures can develop in the system @xcite .",
    "rich magnetic domain structures like stripes , chevrons , labyrinths and bubbles associated to the competition between dipolar long range interactions and strong anisotropies perpendicular to the plane of the film were observed experimentally .",
    "a lot of theoretical work has been done on the morphology and stability of these magnetic structures @xcite . beside that , it has been observed the existence of a switching transition from perpendicular to in - plane ordering at low but finite temperature @xcite : at low temperature the film magnetization is perpendicular to the film surface , as temperature rises the magnetization flips to an in - plane configuration .",
    "eventually the out - of - plane and the in plane magnetization become zero @xcite .",

    "the structures developed in the system depend on the sample geometry and size .",
    "several situations are discussed in reference @xcite and citations therein .",
    "+ although the structures developed in the system are well known the phase diagram of the model is still being studied .",
    "there are several possibilities since we can combine the parameters in many ways .",

    "is known to present no transition @xcite . for @xmath15",
    "the model is in the ising universality class @xcite undergoing a order - disorder phase transition . if @xmath16 the model is in the @xmath17 universality class . in this case",
    "it is known to have a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( @xmath3 ) phase transition which is characterized by a vortex - anti - vortex unbinding , with no true long range order @xcite . *",

    "although , the different results agree between themselves about the character of the different regions , much care has to be taken because they were obtained by using a cut - off , @xmath22 , in the dipolar term .",
    "the long range character of the potential is lost , consequently we can expect a line of @xmath3 transition coming from region @xmath1 to region @xmath2 .",

    "this lack of long range order is prevented by the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",

    "we could not detect any other transition for @xmath79 , indicating that : the line labelled @xmath32 ends somewhere in between @xmath80 or the crossing at @xmath32 occurs at a lower temperature ( @xmath81 ) outside the range of our simulated data .",
    "in earlier studies several authors have claimed that the model for ultrathin magnetic films defined by the equation [ hamiltonian ] presents three phases . referring to figure [ fig1 ]",
    "it is believed that the line labelled @xmath32 is of first order .",
    "the line @xmath78 and @xmath68 are of second order .",
    "those results were obtained by introducing a cut off in the long range interaction of the hamiltonian . in the present work",
    "we have used a numerical monte carlo approach to study the phase diagram of the model for @xmath82 and @xmath83 and @xmath40 . in order to compare our results to those discussed above",
    "we have introduced a cut off in the long range dipolar interaction . a finite size scaling analysis of the magnetization , specific heat , susceptibilities and binder s cumulant clearly indicates that the line labelled @xmath32 is of first order and the line @xmath68 is of second order in agreement with other results . however , the @xmath78 line is of @xmath3 type .",
    "after analysing the results obtained , some questions come out :    1 .",
    "is it possible the existence of a limiting range of interaction in the dipolar term beyond which the character of the transition changes from @xmath3 to second order ? 2 .",
    "how does the line labelled @xmath32 end in the phase diagram ? 3 .",
    "what is the character of the intersection point of the three lines in the phase diagram ?    in a very preliminary calculation rapini et al.@xcite studied the model with true dipolar long range interactions .",
    "their results led them to suspect of a phase transition of the bkt involving the unbinding of vortices - anti - vortices pairs in the model .",
    "however , to respond those questions it is necessary to make an more detailed study of the model for several values of the cut off range @xmath22 . in a simulation program",
    "we have to be careful in taking larger @xmath22 values since we have to augment the lattice size proportionally to prevent misinterpretations .",
