    "this is the simple reason that they exhibit the same @xmath63-dependence .",
    "one can also easily confirm that @xmath142 is positive when we make use of the membrane mobility tensor , because the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : drift ] ) is the product of the first and the second derivatives of the mobility tensor which have opposite signs .",
    "this leads to @xmath183 indicating a chemotaxis - like drift as mentioned before .    in this work",

    "can also exert forces to the surrounding solvent  @xcite .",
    "although we did not take into account such normal forces which induce membrane undulation , consideration of normal forces as well as lateral ones will provide us with a general understanding of active diffusion in biomembranes  @xcite .",
    "we have also assumed that the force dipoles are fixed in a membrane and are distributed homogeneously .",
    "it would be interesting to consider the case when active proteins can also move laterally in the membrane and even interact with each other through a nematic - like interaction  @xcite .",
    "the full equation of motion now involves potential - of - mean - force interactions in the multi - particle diffusion equations that describe the combined motions of the passive particle and active proteins in the membrane .",
