    "we find that it is hard to discriminate on the basis of continuum emission alone , but that thermal x - ray line emission can easily differentiate between ic and pion - decay  models because pion - decay  requires a high proton number density , @xmath2 , and the thermal emission scales as @xmath3 .",
    "until now , fits to the broad - band emission that incorporate nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) have not accurately accounted for the thermal x - ray emission that might be present .",
    "we do this here for a snr evolving in a uniform circumstellar medium ( csm ) with no density enhancements as might occur with a pre - sn dense shell , nearby molecular cloud , etc .",
    "we find that the lack of observed thermal line emission _ eliminates pion - decay _ as the source of tev emission in models with uniform circumstellar media .",
    "the essential elements of our cr - hydro - nei model have been presented in @xcite , and references therein .",
    "we couple a one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of an evolving snr with nonlineardiffusive shock acceleration .",
    "the ionization structure , free electron number density , and electron temperature in the evolving interaction region between the forward shock ( fs ) and contact discontinuity ( cd ) are determined with a self - consistent treatment of the nonequilibrium ionization ( nei ) .",

    "the parameters are chosen to simultaneously match the hess tev observations @xcite and the _ suzaku _ x - ray continuum @xcite .",

    "* ) .    for the thermal x - ray emission ,",
    "we assume cosmic abundances and compare two extremes for heating the initially cold electrons .",
    "the slowest possible heating is from coulomb collisions and the fastest is instant equilibration between electrons and protons , presumably produced by wave - particle interactions . for shock speeds above @xmath20",
    "km s@xmath21 , it has been suggested that electrons are heated very rapidly to @xmath22kev by lower hybrid waves , after which continued heating to @xmath23kev proceeds through coulomb collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since , as we show below , coulomb collisions alone rapidly heat the gas to @xmath24kev , any difference between lower hybrid wave heating and coulomb heating would only be important for uv and optical lines , so pure coulomb models are appropriate for the x - ray emission .",
    "it is important to note that , in our cr - hydro - nei model for the interaction region between the cd and fs , including x - ray line emission only requires two additional assumptions .",
    "one is the csm elemental abundance and the other is the electron heating model . for type ia sne , and a wide range of low - to - moderate mass core - collapse sne , it is reasonable to assume solar abundances for the csm ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the two heating extremes we consider cover all likely possibilities .",

    "even though @xmath58 throughout the simulation for coulomb equilibration , @xmath59 approaches @xmath60k ( @xmath61ev ) rapidly before leveling out .    in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig:5stack ] , we plot the thermal x - ray emission between 1 and 2 kev , for both instant and coulomb equilibration , at the end of the simulation for parcels of plasma shocked at previous times .",
    "the dashed curves are the continuum emission between 1 and 2 kev and the total emission ( solid curves ) , including lines , stands well above this regardless of the electron equilibration . as the left end of the bottom panel shows , at @xmath62yr , plasma that was",
    "shocked @xmath63 years earlier is sufficiently ionized to produce a substantial flux in lines regardless of the electron equilibration .    in the top two panels of figure  [ fig : xray ]",
    "we compare our hadronic model to _ suzaku _ observations of j1713  @xcite for coulomb ( top panel ) and instant equilibration ( middle panel ) .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "observations have been adjusted for interstellar extinction and all model parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:5stack ] . for our hadronic model",
    ", we have chosen parameters that result in pion - decaydominating the gev - tev emission , i.e. , @xmath2 must be above some limit and @xmath15 must be below some limit for this to be the case .",
    "figure  [ fig : xray ] makes it clear , however , that the x - ray line emission is much stronger in the hadronic model than can be accommodated by observations .",
    "this is true for coulomb equilibration even though the bremsstrahlung  continuum remains well below the _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "the only way to lower this emission relative to the synchrotron continuum would be to increase @xmath15 or to decrease @xmath2 to values that would then no longer reproduce the observed gamma - ray emission .",
    "this is true regardless of the electron equilibration .",
    "we note that lowering @xmath2 in uniform csm models requires lowering @xmath10 to maintain @xmath40pc .",
    "we are unable to find any set of parameters that gives pion - decay  dominating the tev emission without producing emission lines around 1 kev that are inconsistent with the _ suzaku _ observations .    in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : xray ]",
    "we show our leptonic model where we have chosen parameters to be consistent with the smooth _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "in addition to the parameters discussed already , we have arbitrarily adjusted the overall normalization of both models to match the observations .",
    "the hadronic model has been multiplied by 0.95 and the leptonic model by 0.2 .",
    "normalization values @xmath64 might correspond , observationally , to a partially complete shell morphology for the snr , or possibly some reduction in the dsa injection and/or acceleration efficiency over some fraction of the snr surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure  3 ,",
    "we show our best fit hadronic and leptonic models , folded through the _ suzaku _ xis instrument response . for both models",
    ", we simulated 20ks observations of the entire snr with no background subtraction , assuming a galactic column density n@xmath65 = 7.9 @xmath66 10@xmath67 @xmath68 . when compared to the _ suzaku _ observations ( cf . , figs .",
    "10 or 11 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is clear that _ suzaku _ would have detected lines as strong as those produced in our hadronic model had they been present .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : broadband ] , we show broad - band fits to radio , _ suzaku _ , preliminary _ fermi - lat _ , and hess observations of rx j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "the hadronic and leptonic models both produce reasonable fits if the thermal x - ray line emission is ignored .",
    "when the thermal x - rays are considered , the hadronic model is excluded .",
    "only the cosmic microwave background is used to determine the ic emission .",
    "it is important to note in considering figs .",
    "[ fig : xray ] and [ fig : broadband ] that equally good fits to the _ continuum _ observations can be obtained with different parameter combinations .",
    "this , and the fact that the various models that have been applied to rx j1713.7 - 3946  differ in details , accounts for the relatively small differences in parameters we obtain compared to those obtained by other modelers ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , consistency with the thermal x - ray line emission forces the csm density down and @xmath15 up so no set of parameters can be found that result in pion - decay  dominating the gev - tev emission .",
    "characteristically of efficient dsa , the cr - hydro - nei model produces an overall shock compression , @xmath69 , and a subshock compression , @xmath70 .",
    "nevertheless , even with 50% efficiency ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath71 remains large enough for electrons temperatures to be high enough for strong line production .",
    "the only factor we see that could lower the thermal emission substantially in a uniform csm model , is the abundance .",
    "if the csm is nearly devoid of heavy elements , thermal line emission will be suppressed . depletion onto dust",
    "will cut down c , mg , si and fe , but it will not affect the o lines , which are the brightest in the model , or n or ne . furthermore , a substantial fraction of the dust is destroyed once @xmath72 becomes a few times @xmath73s-@xmath26 , so some of the refractory elements would be liberated ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one does not expect really severe depletion in the low density uniform medium , but there could be significant dust in a red giant wind .",
    "it is also possible that the progenitor was a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star , and this could give anomalous abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "conversion of h to he reduces the number of electrons , weakening the line emission per unit mass by as much as a factor of two .",
    "however , wc and wo stars show much larger overabundances of o and ne , which produce the strongest lines in the spectra , so the lines would be strongly enhanced . in wn stars ,",
    "carbon and oxygen have been converted to nitrogen .",
    "the o lines would be weakened , and the n vii line at 500 ev would be luminous but badly attenuated .",
    "the ne ix and x lines at 922 and 1022 ev would then be the strongest in the spectrum at 0.5 to 1 times the strengths predicted .",
    "thus , even in the case of a progenitor wind with anomalous abundances , we would still expect to see strong line emission in the swept - up csm , and this would be present in the suzaku observations .",
    "while several authors have proposed that emission lines could be undetectable in j1713  because of low shock temperatures or time - dependent ionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that a snr with properties typically ascribed to j1713 , expanding in a uniform csm with solar elemental abundances , will produce strong x - ray emission lines when electron equilibration and non - equilibrium ionization  are taken into account .",
    "this places constraints on the csm density , @xmath2 , and on the relativisticelectron to proton ratio , @xmath15 , to be consistent with _",
    "observations which show a smooth x - ray synchrotron  continuum with no lines .",
    "while particular values of @xmath2 and @xmath15 will depend somewhat on details of various dsa and snr models , in any uniform csm model the csm must have a relatively low density and the electron to proton ratio of shock accelerated particles must be relatively high in order to produce a satisfactory fit to the _ suzaku _ data .",
    "models where pion - decay  produces the observed tev emission require densities that are too high and values of @xmath15 that are too low to be consistent with the _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "we note that we have actually only computed a lower limit to the line emission since we have not included line emission from the ejecta material heated by the reverse shock .",
    "if emission from a rs had been included , our conclusion that pion - decay  is excluded could only be strengthened .",
    "apart from minor differences , our fit to the broad - band spectrum ( bottom panel fig .",
    "[ fig : broadband ] ) is consistent with others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where ic dominated the tev emission .",
    "our results differ substantially from the conjecture made by @xcite that the post - shock temperature can be reduced below x - ray emitting temperatures in strong shocks .",
    "the conclusions of @xcite are based on scaling arguments in the limit of extremely high sonic and alfvn  mach numbers where the acceleration efficiency approaches 100% . in this case , the subshock may become weak enough to limit heating to the values @xcite suggest .",
    "however , mach numbers as high as assumed in the @xcite scalings are not obtained for reasonable ambient magnetic fields and other parameters normally assigned to rx j1713.7 - 3946 . when nonlinear effects are fully taken into account for j1713  parameters ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for acceleration efficiencies even modestly below 100% , the post - shock plasma ( i.e. , the proton component ) is heated more strongly than @xcite suggest .",
    "we further emphasize that there is little freedom to reduce the thermal emission since we have calculated the nei for the two electron heating extremes : coulomb collisions and instant equilibration .",
    "for both extremes , and all cases in between , the shock heated plasma produces strong line emission . as fig .",
    "[ fig:5stack ] shows , it is not necessary for electrons to equilibrate with protons to become hot enough for line emission . for coulomb collisions in our hadronic model , @xmath74 remains less than about 0.1 for @xmath75yr .",
    "once it becomes clear that x - ray emission lines will be produced efficiently with a luminosity approximately @xmath76 , the intensities , @xmath77 , of all the emission processes can be roughly scaled with the important parameters , @xmath2 , @xmath15 , and the average downstream field @xmath78 as : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 here , the superscript `` rel '' indicates the number density of relativisticparticles capable of producing the observed radiation .",
    "the factor @xmath83 is some function of the dsa efficiency , i.e. , the fraction of ambient protons turned into relativistic  protons capable of producing gev - tev emission ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "we also assume that the relativisticprotons producing pion - decay  are drawn from the same population as the target protons .",
    "the expression for @xmath85 assumes the underlying electron spectrum is a power law , @xmath86 , with @xmath87 .",
    "if the tev emission is from pion - decay , then the ratio @xmath88 is fixed by the observations and @xmath89 where @xmath90 is some constant determined by either the radio or x - ray synchrotron  observations .",
    "if @xmath90 is set by radio observations , radiation losses do nt play a role . to hide the x - ray lines , we need to increase @xmath91",
    "thus , the only parameter that can change the relative intensity @xmath92 is the dsa efficiency .",
    "the x - ray line to synchrotron continuum ratio can be changed by changing the magnetic field , but the absolute ratio of x - ray lines to gamma rays is basically fixed in the hadronic scenario . from equations 3 and 4 ,",
    "@xmath93 and for the hadronic model ( top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : broadband ] ) , @xmath94 is more than an order of magnitude too large compared to observations to be accommodated .",
    "changing @xmath83 and/or @xmath95 can not hide the lines if @xmath8 is too large .    of course , the situation is more complicated for several reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the line emission depends importantly on the snr evolution ( i.e. , the ionization age ; fig .",
    "[ fig:5stack ] ) and the csm composition .",
    "( 2 ) the factor @xmath83 depends on the shock dynamics , the magnetic field , and uncertain details of nl dsa .",
    "furthermore , since radiation losses are important for relativistic  electrons but not relativistic  protons , @xmath96 at high energies and @xmath15 depends on @xmath95 for x - ray synchrotronemission . this will change the @xmath92 scaling at x - ray energies but will not change the relative intensities of radio vs. pion - decayemission .",
    "( 3 ) the detailed fits to the _ suzaku _ , _ fermi - lat _ , and hess data depend critically on the _ shape _ of the underlying electron and proton spectra in the turnover region , and on the snr magnetic field morphology .",
    "despite these complications , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : synratio ] ) and ( [ eq : linepp ] ) , must largely control the overall scaling .    for our hadronic model shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : xray ] and [ fig : broadband ] , we have chosen particular values of @xmath2 , @xmath15 , and @xmath13 to match the shape and relative normalization of the radio , x - ray , and tev observations .",
    "for the acceleration efficiency , we have used @xmath36 , i.e. , 50% of the instantaneous fs ram kinetic energy flux is put into relativistic  protons .",
    "while there is little indication that larger values of @xmath14 occur in snrs , we have explored @xmath97 and find a poorer match to the broadband observations and no improvement in the hadronic fit to the x - ray lines .",
    "one reason for this is that , in nonlinear  dsa , an increase in acceleration efficiency must be accompanied by an increase in the overall shock compression ratio , @xmath98 .",
    "this translates to an increase in the downstream plasma density , a decrease in the electron temperature equilibration time , and stronger x - ray line production . furthermore , increasing the acceleration efficiency also increases @xmath78 due to compression and possibly more by mfa .",
    "because of changes in @xmath78 , increases in @xmath14 are constrained by equation  [ eq : gg ] .",
    "we emphasize again that the modeled shape of the high - energy turnover is both critical and uncertain . for ic and synchrotron ,",
    "the shape depends on the competition between acceleration and radiation loss timescales in the acceleration region .",
    "the turnover will be further modified by radiation losses as the electrons evolve behind the shock and by diffusion of the high - energy electrons into regions of different density and magnetic field .",
    "in fact , high - energy electrons might diffuse away from regions of high magnetic field , reducing their synchrotronemission while they still emit ic , for pion - decay , the turnover depends on the maximum energy the fs can produce which depends on the self - generated diffusion of the highest energy , escaping particles .    since these effects are yet to be described precisely , all existing snr models , including ours , make arbitrary approximations that importantly influence the turnover shape .",
    "the fit to the shape of the _ fermi - lat _ and hess observations is determined largely by @xmath18 , @xmath17 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the detailed fit to the shape of the _ suzaku _ observations depends largely on @xmath17 and @xmath13 .",
    "other effects may be important as well .",
    "the synchrotron  spectrum might be hardened in the turnover region by stochastic effects , as described in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as suggested by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a photon source in addition to the cosmic microwave background might improve the ic fit to the highest energy hess points .",
    "in contrast to the shapes of the radiation spectra near their maximum energies , the relative normalizations of synchrotron , ic , pion - decay , and thermal x - ray emission are less uncertain because they depend more concretely on basic parameters . we believe that none of the approximations in our cr - hydro - nei model are significant enough to change our basic conclusion : the constraints on ambient density and @xmath15 from thermal x - ray emission rule out pion - decay  as the mechanism producing tev emission in models with a uniform csm .",
    "the fact that electrons are likely producing the highest energy photons observed from rx j1713.7 - 3946 , does not lead us to suggest that protons are absent or less energetic .",
    "our leptonic model assumes that at any instant 25% of the shock ram kinetic energy flux goes into relativistic protons while less than 1% goes into relativistic  electrons .",
    "electrons are observed simply because they radiate more efficiently than protons in low density media . as fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] shows , the maximum proton energy is similar in our two models , i.e. , @xmath99 ev . the increase in @xmath16 from the higher shocked magnetic field in the hadronic model ( e.g. , @xmath100@xmath28 g  at the end of the simulation vs. @xmath101@xmath28 g  for the leptonic model ) is partially offset by the smaller @xmath18 factor ( @xmath102 for the hadronic model while @xmath103 for the leptonic model ) .",
    "the electron maximum energy is about a factor of 10 higher in the leptonic model , and the shapes of the electron spectra are different , due to the effects of radiation losses .    one result of our leptonic model , which integrates emission over the entire remnant , that may conflict with observations is the low shocked magnetic field .",
    "a low @xmath104 favors the leptonic model and we obtain @xmath105@xmath28 g  for the parameters used here .",
    "much higher estimates for @xmath104 have been obtained for thin x - ray filaments where the sharp x - ray edges and/or rapid time variations are attributed to strong synchrotron  losses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our uniform csm assumption can not descibe filaments and it is possible that more complicated , multi - component models could account for this .",
    "for example , if the synchrotron  emission originates from a smaller region than the ic emission ( due , for example , to a strong but compact postshock magnetic field ) , then a larger field strength would be possible for a given inverse - compton flux .",
    "we have been careful to emphasize that we only consider a uniform csm in this paper . while pion - decay  is eliminated in this simplest case , snr rx j1713.7 - 3946  is certainly more complex . as _ fermi - lat _ observations improve with time , the shape of the combined _ fermi - lat _ and hess observations may indicate that the gev - tev emission is , in fact , hadronic in origin .",
    "this will require some multi - component model where relativistic  protons interact with a high density target but care must still be taken to avoid inconsistency with the _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "if the fs runs into a high density shell , strong x - ray lines are likely to be produced along with the enhanced pion - decay  emission .",
    "if the highest energy protons escape upstream from the fs and impact a high density medium before the material is shock heated , pion - decay  emission may be strong without strong accompanying x - ray line emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we model the broad - band emission from snr rx j1713.7 - 3946  including , for the first time , a consistent calculation of thermal x - ray emission together with non - thermal emission in a nonlinear  diffusive shock acceleration  ( dsa ) model . </S>",
    "<S> our model tracks the evolution of the snr including the plasma ionization state between the forward shock and the contact discontinuity . </S>",
    "<S> we use a plasma emissivity code to predict the thermal x - ray emission spectrum assuming the initially cold electrons are heated either by coulomb collisions with the shock heated protons ( the slowest possible heating ) , or come into instant equilibration with the protons . for either electron heating model , </S>",
    "<S> electrons reach @xmath0k rapidly and the x - ray line emission near 1 kev is more than 10 times as luminous as the underlying thermal bremsstrahlung  continuum . </S>",
    "<S> since recent _ suzaku _ observations show no detectable line emission , this places strong constraints on the unshocked ambient medium density and on the relativisticelectron to proton ratio . for the uniform circumstellar medium ( csm ) models </S>",
    "<S> we consider , the low densities and high relativistic  electron to proton ratios required to match the _ suzaku _ x - ray observations _ </S>",
    "<S> definitively rule out pion - decay _ as the emission process producing gev - tev photons . </S>",
    "<S> we show that leptonic models , where inverse - compton  scattering against the cosmic background radiation dominates the gev - tev emission , produce better fits to the broad - band thermal and non - thermal observations in a uniform csm . </S>"
