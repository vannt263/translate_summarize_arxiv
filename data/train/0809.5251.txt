    "in this work we investigate the role that three - body forces play within the nuclear shell model ( sm ) approach .",
    "establishment of the effective interaction parameters , study of hierarchy in strength from single - particle ( s.p . ) to two - body , three - body , and beyond , manifestations in energy spectra and transitions rates , comparison with different traditional sm calculations , and overall assessment for the need of beyond - two - body sm are the topics for this discussion .",
    "previous works in this direction have shown an improved description of nuclear spectra @xcite and the significance of three - body monopole renormalizations @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction hamiltonian of rank @xmath2 is a sum @xmath3 is the @xmath4-body rotationally invariant component of the interaction .",
    "the @xmath4-particle creation operators @xmath5 with the total angular momentum @xmath6 and magnetic projection @xmath7 are normalized @xmath8 and expressed through the s.p .",
    "creation operators as @xmath9 where index @xmath10 labels a s.p . state .",
    "the choice of coefficients @xmath11 that defines a full set of orthogonal operators @xmath12 is generally not unique . for numerical work",
    "it is most convenient to use a full set of orthogonal eigenstates @xmath13 of some @xmath4-particle system @xcite . in the @xmath14-scheme",
    "sm we generate states only for a particular value of the total magnetic projection @xmath7 , the remaining states are obtained by the raising and lowering angular momentum operators .",
    "it is possible @xcite , to select a single reference two - body hamiltonian which then can be used to define all many - body operators @xmath5 for @xmath15 the traditional sm hamiltonian is @xmath16 where the two - body operators @xmath17 are determined with the help of the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "as a first example we present here a study of a single-@xmath19 @xmath0 shell , related discussion may be found in ref .",
    "we consider two types of systems @xmath20 isotones starting from @xmath21ca with protons filling the @xmath0 shell and the z=20 , @xmath22ca isotopes with valence neutrons .",
    "the states in these systems that are identified by experiments with the @xmath23 valence space are listed in tab . [",
    "tab : experimental - data ] . the @xmath23 shell is unique because of symmetries associated with the quasispin and particle - hole conjugation @xcite .",
    "these symmetries are violated if interaction is beyond the two - body .",
    ".states in @xmath23 valence space with spin and seniority listed in the first and second columns .",
    "the @xmath24 denotes seniority mixed states in 3b@xmath23 . following are columns with data for @xmath20 isotones and @xmath25 isotopes .",
    "three columns for each type of valence particles list name and excitation energy , experimental binding energy , and energy from the three - body sm calculation discussed in the text .",

    "the above single-@xmath19 example is remarkable due to its transparency and simplicity . the general sm case , however , is complicated by an enormously large number of parameters and thus difficulty of the fit @xcite .",
    "selecting dynamically relevant components of the many - body forces requires an in - depth microscopic understanding of their origin .",
    "establishment of the physically relevant set of the operator basis @xmath5 is an important start . as discussed in the introduction , for @xmath26 the index @xmath27 must include an additional information about the coupling scheme , the choice of which is not unique .",
    "previous ideas on selecting the best set of triplet operators include a possibility of using the @xmath28 operators for each single - particle level @xcite .",
    "for @xmath29 the three - body force associated with this operator , discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumulative ] , is indeed a dominating component in binding .",
    "however , it is not clear if such construction , built upon s.p .",
    "levels , is the best choice in a general case given renormalization of the s.p .",
    "effective degrees of freedom by the two - body interaction .",
    "the two - body hamiltonian of the pairing type would , for instance , suggest the use of quasiparticles .",
    "perusing this idea we propose an alternative approach which assumes a hierarchy of forces , where higher rank components of the hamiltonian are perturbative , and the operator basis are selected using the many - body dynamics .",
    "consider @xmath30 , @xmath31 hamiltonian to be determined by some procedure .",
    "while building a higher rank forces @xmath32 , we assume @xmath33 to be perturbatively small .",
    "thus , within the lowest order perturbation theory the @xmath4-particle wave - functions of @xmath30 and @xmath34 are the same and can be found by diagonalizing @xmath30 @xmath35 we use these eigenstates to define a full set of @xmath4-body operators @xmath12 as @xmath36 which we view as the most relevant basis . with a perturbative nature in mind",
    "the term @xmath33 is diagonal in these basis , @xmath37 if @xmath38 thus , the number of parameters is reduced .",
    "further steps can be taken to discuss the significance of the diagonal parameters . when pairing is important one can take only those states ( basis operators ) that correspond to the lowest quasiparticle excitations .",
    "experimental data can be used for guidance .",
    "for example , if the @xmath4-particle states are known and identified experimentally to have energies @xmath39 a direct fit can be done by setting the corresponding @xmath4-body interaction parameters as @xmath40 so that the new hamiltonian reproduces exactly the experimental energies .",
    "there are some issues to stress .",
    "certainly , the transition from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , is not a subject to this approach .",
    "one has to have a starting sm hamiltonian @xmath43 determined from g - matrix techniques or by other methods , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is possible to rewrite the two - body hamiltonian as a diagonal structure by introducing new pair operators , this is useful for perturbative adjustments of the two - body interactions .",
    "the two - body sm hamiltonian can be used as a primary component of interaction , defining many - body operators , and treating all higher rank forces as perturbations .",
    "it is important for this approach to stay within the perturbation theory .",
    "departing a perturbative form , it is feasible with this construction to create a hamiltonian that exactly reproduces energies of all states within a given valence space , tests show that in this case the many - body forces have an inverse hierarchy with higher rank ones giving a bigger contribution .",
    "it is an established practice in the sm approach to include a mass dependence of the two - body forces . for a short range delta - type interaction",
    "the radial overlap integrals scale as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the radius of the nucleus .",
    "thus , in terms of the mass - number @xmath46 the two - body interaction @xmath47 at the opposite extreme the long - range coulomb leads to an @xmath48 scaling .",
    "the fits to experimental data lead to a compromising middle value @xmath49@xcite .",
    "the many - body forces are expected to be short range , requiring all participating particles to be localized .",
    "the resulting scaling that follows from this argument is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass of the core . at this stage",
    "it is not clear if this argument is valid and if scaling should be included .    as a demonstration",
    "we discuss here a 3-body force in the case of oxygen isotopes . for the two - body interaction hamiltonian",
    "we take a usd shell model @xcite .",
    "the total number of triplet operators , not counting magnetic projections , is 37 which in a general 3-body interaction hamiltonian gives a large number of parameters .",
    "examination of experimental data for @xmath52o and results from the different shell model hamiltonians usd , usda and usdb @xcite show a rather systematic difference ; in particular for the lowest @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 states .",
    "these are one quasiparticle excitations .",
    "thereby , we define the corresponding triplet operators @xmath56 with @xmath57 and 1/2 from the three - particle eigenstates of the usd hamiltonian ; and specify the three - body interaction in the diagonal form @xmath58 for fig . [",
    "fig : usd ] we fit the three parameters in eq . to the ground states in even systems and to the three lowest states with one unpaired particle in the odd systems for mass @xmath59 to 22 oxygen isotopes .",
    "the values from the best fit are @xmath60 kev , @xmath61 kev , and @xmath62 kev .",
    "the improvement in the spectrum , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : usd ] is significant .",
    "certainly , this first study is to be continued , there is a possibility to examine more interaction terms , discuss scaling of the matrix elements , and to consider fitting all parameters for one- , two- , and three - body components together . modifying perturbatively",
    "the two - body part should not invalidate the quality of the usd - defined three - body basis .",
    "o isotopes . for every nucleus ,",
    "experimentally observed states are compared with the spectrum that includes three - body forces and with the two - body usd sm hamiltonian , from left to right , as identified at the bottom .",
    "[ fig : usd],width=432 ]",
    "dealing with many - body forces , understanding their origins , structure , and hierarchy of renormalizations is an important component for a successful solution of a many - body problem .",
    "this presentations aims to continue the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite related to the phenomenological three - body forces within the context of the nuclear shell model approach .",
    "the study of nuclei in the @xmath0 shell shows evidence of such forces through an overall fit to data with full examination of uncertainties , via examination of binding energies and associated differences in excitation spectra , and with an in - depth analysis of violations of symmetries in the structure of wave functions .",
    "the general sm problem with many - body forces is complicated by a large number of parameters , the absence of a good microscopic approach , difficulties in fits and questions related to renormalizations of strengths .",
    "these issues are discussed and some methods for dealing with them are proposed . in particular , in analogy to a hartree - fock procedure where single - particle states are defined in the way to best represent the dynamics of the system , we propose here methods to identify the most relevant many - body operators .",
    "these techniques are demonstrated using a chain of oxygen isotopes ."
