    "the atlas detector at the lhc  @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ atlas ] , was designed primarily for precise measurements in the highest - energy proton - proton collisions , particularly to discover new high - mass particle states .",
    "however , it is also a very capable detector for the measurement of heavy ion collisions at the highest energies achieved to date , already a factor of 14 higher than available at the relativistic heavy ion collider .",
    "the atlas inner detector is immersed in a 2 tesla solenoid magnetic field and provides precise reconstruction of particle trajectories typically with three pixel layers and four double sided silicon strip detectors out to @xmath2 , as well as a transition radiation tracker , out to @xmath3 .",
    "the longitudinally segmented atlas calorimeter provides electromagnetic and hadronic measurements out to @xmath4 , with particularly high spatial precision in the @xmath5 direction . finally , the atlas muon spectrometer is located outside the calorimeters ( which range out most of the hadronic backgrounds ) and measures muon tracks out to @xmath6 .    the lhc provided lead - lead collisions to the three large experiments in november and december 2010 , and atlas accumulated almost ten inverse microbarns of luminosity , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ atlas ] .",
    "the analyses shown here typically use up to eight inverse microbarns , during which the main solenoid was activated . a smaller dataset with field off was used for multiplicity analyses .",

    "the charged particle multiplicity is important both from a thermodynamic standpoint , as it is proportional to the initial state entropy , as well as from the perspective of energy loss calculations which require an estimate of the initial gluon density . in atlas",
    ", the multiplicity has been measured  @xcite with the solenoid field turned off to mitigate the losses from the bending of low momentum particles .",
    "the pixel layers within @xmath9 are used to minimize the non - primary backgrounds by only using hits consistent with a minimum - ionizing particle emanating from the primary vertex .",
    "the pixel hits are assembled both into `` tracklets '' ( two hits , both consistent with the measured primary vertex ) and full tracks ( three points , reconstructed with the main atlas tracking software ) . in all , three methods are used , each with quite different systematic uncertainties , providing accurate measurements up to the highest particle densities and uncertainties of only a few percent .",
    "the collision centrality is estimated using the total transverse energy measured in the atlas forward calorimeter ( fcal , covering @xmath10 ) and bins are selected using an estimated sampling fraction of @xmath11 .",
    "the multiplicity results are shown in fig .",
    "[ paper_dndetanpart ] .",
    "the yield averaged over @xmath12 , @xmath13 , agrees well ( consistent within the stated systematic uncertainties ) with the previously - available alice data  @xcite , both in the most central 0 - 6% events and as a function of collision centrality ( parametrized by @xmath14 ) . after scaling the rhic data by the observed factor of 2.15 , the centrality dependence at the lhc is also seen to be quite similar to that observed at a much lower energy .",
    "elliptic flow as a function of transverse momentum for the 40 - 50% centrality bin , compared with data from rhic and the lhc .",
    "]    the collective response of the system to the initial geometric configuration of the nucleons in the colliding nuclei is typically characterized by the `` elliptic flow '' , or a @xmath15 modulation in the azimuthal angular distributions relative to a measured `` event plane . '' in atlas , the event plane is measured in the fcal which subtends @xmath16 .",
    "elliptic flow is measured using tracks in the inner detector out to @xmath2 .",
    "the effects of `` non flow '' are minimized by maximizing the gap between the track and the event plane measurement by using the event plane from the opposite fcal hemisphere to the measured track  @xcite . the elliptic flow ( @xmath17 ) as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity has been measured out to @xmath18 gev and @xmath7 for eight centrality bins .",
    "there is no substantial pseudorapidity dependence out to the maximum measured @xmath5 , but there is a strong @xmath19 dependence with a pronounced rise in @xmath17 out to @xmath20 gev , a slower decrease out to @xmath21 gev and then a very weak dependence out to the highest measured @xmath19 .",
    "[ v2_vs_pt ] compares the atlas data with already - published alice  @xcite data as well as lower energy data from phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite , all from the 40 - 50% centrality bin ( except star data from 40 - 60% ) .",
    "one finds that all of the data is quite similar , even at high @xmath19 within the large statistical errors of the phenix @xmath22 data .",
    "it is not obvious if this apparent scaling behavior is consistent with expectations from differential energy loss .",
    "higher order fourier coefficients ( @xmath23 ) as a function of transverse momentum for six centrality bins .",
    "it is observed that while @xmath17 varies strongly with centrality , @xmath24 are nearly invariant . ]    after the realization that initial state fluctuations can induce higher fourier modes in the overlap region of the two nuclei  @xcite , elliptic flow has now been joined by the study of higher - order harmonic flow coefficients  @xcite .",
    "these are measured each in their own event plane .",
    "the resolution has been evaluated by a variety of subdetector combinations and it is found that atlas can resolve modes up to @xmath25 in the most central 40% of events .",
    "these are shown as a function of @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ vn_vs_pt ] in six centrality bins .",
    "one sees the rapid change of @xmath17 with centrality , expected from previous measurements , but only a modest change in the higher order coefficients , suggesting that the latter are mainly sensitive to fluctuations of nucleon positions .",
    "still , it is expected that the information from these higher coefficients can distinguish between competing physics scenarios attempting to explain the initial state as well as providing new information on the viscosity to entropy ratio .",
    "measured two - particle correlation function for @xmath26 gev and @xmath27 in the 1% most central collisions ( open circles ) .",
    "the reconstructed correlation function using the coefficients from the event plane measurement ( and @xmath28 from the two - particle measurement ) is also shown and agrees quite well with the directly measured correlation function , using both full fcal ( solid line ) and fcal@xmath29 ( dashed line ) methods . ]",
    "a longstanding puzzle at rhic is the observation of unusual structures ( e.g. the mach cone  @xcite ) in the two particle correlation function , particularly on the `` away side '' relative to a high @xmath19 particle .",
    "both star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite observed a strongly - modified away - side peak which even developed a `` dip '' at @xmath30 in the most central events .",
    "however , this was explained to arise most likely from the presence of higher flow coefficients beyond elliptic flow  @xcite . in atlas",
    ", the correlation function has been measured with large separation in @xmath5 to suppress the contribution from jets and a discrete fourier transform ( dft ) is used to extract coefficients out to @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "these are found to agree quite well with the @xmath31 extracted using event plane approaches . more interestingly , when the event plane coefficients are used to construct a comparable two particle correlation function @xmath32 , one finds a striking agreement with the correlations measured directly , as shown in fig .",
    "this suggests that what were formerly thought to be indications of jet - medium interactions may well result simply from the presence of higher - order flow harmonics , arising through a combination of nucleon position fluctuations and viscous effects .",

    "an iterative procedure is applied to remove any residual effect of the jets on the background subtraction .",
    "the final jets are corrected for jet energy scale and resolution based on pythia jets embedded into hijing , with conservative systematic uncertainties assigned to account for the small differences between the fluctuations seen in data and simulation .",
