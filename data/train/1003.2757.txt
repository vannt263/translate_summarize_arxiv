    "stripe ordering has been observed in high t@xmath9 cuprates , other transition metal oxides , and quantum hall systems at high landau levels @xcite .    in this article , we study the instability toward the spontaneous inhomogeneous phase in dipolar fermionic systems . in two dimensional ( 2d )",
    "systems , the strongest density - channel instability occurs at non - zero momentum , which drives the density wave states under strong dipolar interactions .",
    "this effect is based on the peculiar feature of the fourier transform of the dipolar interaction , which is robust against microscopic details .",
    "however in three dimensions ( 3d ) , the instability at the one - loop level occurs at zero momentum , thus it leads to phase separation into high and low density regions .",

    ", the dipolar interaction in the momentum space @xmath13 takes the form @xcite , @xmath14+\\pi q d^2 \\sin^2\\!\\theta    \\cos 2 \\phi_q , \\label{eq : interaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the dipole moment ; @xmath16 is the azimuthal angle of the momentum @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the angle between the direction of the dipoles and the @xmath19-axis .",
    "@xmath20 is a short - range cutoff roughly equal to the thickness of the system along the @xmath19-direction .",
    "equation is valid for @xmath21 .",
    "however , as shown below , the main conclusion of this paper only relies on the value of @xmath22 at small @xmath23 , and hence all the qualitative results remain invariant even if more accurate and more complicated interactions were taken into account .",
    "we shall also emphasize here that for @xmath24 , @xmath13 is invariant under @xmath25 rotations .",
    "however , for any @xmath26 , the rotational symmetry is reduced to two - fold ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this symmetry property is crucial as a system undergoes the transition to a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) phase .",
    "as will be discussed below , in a system with @xmath25 symmetry , the cdw instability usually leads to the formation of a triangular lattice  @xcite ( a 2d wigner crystal ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the same instability in a system with @xmath27 symmetry is compatible with the formation of a unidirectional cdw , i.e. , a stripe phase  @xcite .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "contains an isotropic part which depends on the microscopic cut - off @xmath20 and an anisotropic part which depends on the azimuthal angle of @xmath16 .",
    "we first consider the purely anisotropic case at @xmath28 and then the interaction simplifies into @xmath29 the major feature of eq .",
    "is its linear dependence on @xmath23 , which play important roles in driving the instability at non - zero wavevectors .    .",

    "the stability criteria of the homogeneous phase corresponds to the energy gap @xmath33 being positive - definite for any @xmath17 .",

    "obviously , @xmath33 is positive - define for any @xmath17 in the noninteracting fermi gas .",
    "this stability remains for a weakly - interacting fermi liquid . on the other hand , if the interaction has an attractive channel [ e.g. the dipolar interaction in eq .",
    "] , an inhomogeneous state could take advantage of the attractive interaction . under strong enough attractive interactions ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath36 , the homogeneous ground state is unstable .",
    "we begin from the weak coupling side , by tuning up the interaction strength . in general , there is a critical dipole moment @xmath37 such that @xmath38 at any @xmath17 for @xmath39 , but @xmath40 at some @xmath17 for @xmath0 . at @xmath41 , @xmath42 for the momenta @xmath43 and",

    "if we increase @xmath15 further above @xmath37 , the density wave fluctuations with momentum @xmath44 undergo an instability and condense . depending on whether @xmath45 is @xmath46 or not , this instability has two different fates . if @xmath47 , the condensation carries a nonzero momentum , which leads to a stripe state : a unidirectional charge - density - wave state with wavevector @xmath45 . on the other hand , if @xmath48 , the condensation takes place at an infinite wavelength and results in phase separation between high and low density regions . here",
    ", the typical size of these high ( low ) density regions and their spatial arrangements are determined by the microscopic details of the system . in the particular case of a dipolar gas ,",
    "the phase separation is sensitive to the details of the short - range behaviors of the interaction .      due to the 2d space - inversion symmetry",

    "was dominated by the first two terms . and",
    "hence the point @xmath54 is a local saddle point of @xmath33 ( i.e. , a local minimum along the line of @xmath55 and a local maximum along @xmath56 ) .",
    "since @xmath57 is a saddle point , instead of the minimum point of @xmath33 , as @xmath15 increases , @xmath33 at some finite momentum will become negative before @xmath58 could reach zero .",
    "thus , @xmath59 must be a nonzero value , which indicates that the system will collapse into a stripe phase for @xmath0 , instead of phase separating .",
    "this is the main conclusion of this paper .",
    "it is noteworthy that this conclusion only depends on the small - momentum ( i.e. long - range ) behaviors of the interaction @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the stripe instability is a universal property of the 2d dipolar fermi gas at @xmath0 , insensitive to the microscopic details of the system . in 2d electron gases ,",
    "a similar conclusion has been found in the classical limit at high temperature when the quantum fluctuations are negligible @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the conclusion of @xmath47 is a non - perturbative result which remains valid to any order in the loop expansion of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "the only assumption required here is the analyticity of @xmath60 as a function of @xmath17 near @xmath54 . in a fermi liquid , it is well - known that @xmath61 is non - analytic at @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fermi wavevector .",

    "@xmath70 is the azimuthal angle of the momentum @xmath17 and @xmath71 is a step function with @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta2d ] , the order wavevector @xmath76 . in experiments",
    ", it is often more convenient to vary the density for a constant @xmath15 .",
    "there , the density need to be higher than a critical value to reach the stripe phase . for krb",
    "( @xmath77 d ) the stripe phase requires the interparticle spacing to be smaller than @xmath78 cm , and for lics ( @xmath79 d ) , the critical spacing is @xmath80 cm .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath59 and @xmath37 we found here are based on the leading order approximation , and can be renormalized by higher order corrections .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath47 remains valid , which is one of the key conclusion of this work .      for @xmath81 , the same conclusion applies for the single component case .",
    "the @xmath20-term in eq .",
    "is momentum independent , which corresponds to short - range contact interaction .",

    "thus , the above conclusion still holds .",
    "we notice that even for @xmath24 , i.e. , when the dipoles are perpendicular to the plane , the stripe instability still exists at large values of @xmath15 although the interaction is now repulsive .",
    "for such an isotropic system ( at @xmath24 ) , it is often assumed that three charge density waves form a triangular lattice to minimize the breaking of the rotational symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , if the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken before the homogeneous state becomes unstable , a stripe phase can be stabilized at zero temperature @xcite . in this case , the stripe ordering spontaneously breaks both the rotational symmetry and the translational symmetry in the direction perpendicular to the stripes , while only the latter is spontaneously breaking in the stripe phases at @xmath26 . due to its unique symmetry breaking pattern ,",
    "the low - energy properties of the stripe phase at @xmath24 is described by the quantum mcmillan - de gennes theory , which is fundamentally different from other similar phases at @xmath26 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the stripe phase at @xmath24 is unstable at any finite temperature due to thermal fluctuations @xcite , while the stripe phases at @xmath85 has a power - law quasi - long range order blow a transition temperature @xmath86 ( see below ) .",
    "in this section , we study two more classes of systems with similar dipolar interactions : ( a ) dipolar gases in 3d and ( b ) 2d dipolar gases composed by multicomponent fermions .    in 3d ,",
    "the dipolar interaction is @xmath87 with @xmath88 measuring the angle between @xmath17 and the dipole moment . due to the structure of @xmath89 , the linear term of @xmath17 in eq .",
    "is now absent in 3d , and hence we could not exclude the possibility of @xmath45 being zero .",
    "in fact , the one - loop calculation at @xmath64 for a system in continuum shows that @xmath90 , \\label{eq : interaction3d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath91 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : delta3d ] , we found @xmath48 within the one - loop approximation , implying a phenomenon of phase separation for @xmath0 .",
    "as discussed above , this is sensitive to the short - range details of the interaction and no universal conclusion is available for case .",
    "now we briefly discuss the multi - component case in 2d ( e.g. the degrees of freedom of hyperfine spins ) whose hamiltonian is @xmath92 where the spin indices @xmath93 and @xmath94 run from @xmath95 to @xmath96 for some integer @xmath97 . here , @xmath98 remains the same as the single - component case in eqs . and .",
    "for a single - component dipolar gas , due to pauli exclusion principle , the @xmath20-term in eq .",
    "( short - range interactions ) has no contribution to any physical properties of the system .",
    "however , for multi - component fermi gases , this term naturally exists in the inter - component interactions and suppresses the stripe instability if it is repulsive . for simplicity",
    "we only consider the case of @xmath99 .",
    "for @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , this short - range part is attractive ( repulsive ) , and hence the stripe state become unfavorable for @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , such an finite momentum instability does not exist in the spin channel because the spin channel interaction arises from the exchange interaction which is regular for small vector of @xmath17 .",
    "the stripe phase has a density modulation in the direction perpendicular to the stripes , which can be detected directly via the measurement of the local densities . in addition",
    ", any scattering experiments would show two interference bragg peaks at momentum @xmath102 in a stripe phase due to this density modulation .",
    "there are also other indirect tools to detect a stripe phase . considering a density wave with density varying along the @xmath103 axis , whose density profile ( to the leading order ) is @xmath104 with @xmath105 being the 2d coordinate in the real space , if we place this system in a shallow potential trap and then introduce an extra narrow 1d potential well along the direction of the stripe , for example , @xmath106 it is energetically favorable to have @xmath107 being a high density region due to the potential well @xmath108 .",
    "we emphasize that in reality , this 1d potential well of @xmath108 shall have a finite width in the @xmath103 direction .",
    "however , as long as the width is much smaller than the wavelength of the stripe , one can treat it as a @xmath109-function to the leading order approximation .",
    "if we move the potential trap along the @xmath110 direction but keep the location of the potential well @xmath108 unchanged , the stripes will largely remain at their initial positions if the displacement of the trap is less than half the wave - length of the stripes @xmath111 , and the stripes will jump over a distance of @xmath112 if the displacement becomes larger than @xmath111 to same the potential energy . on the other hand",
    ", the jump would not happen in a homogeneous state .",
    "this jump will lead to a center of mass oscillation for the trapped particles due to the lack of dissipation , which could serve as an indirect signature for the stripe phase .",
    "this technique is in close analogy to the `` pinning '' effect , which was used to experimentally distinguish the nematic phase from a putative stripe phase in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) under high magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "there , the impurities in the crystal provide similar effects as the local potential in eq . , which will pin down the stripe if the stripe exists . in principle , the presence of stripes will leads to the pinning effect , which shall result in nonlinear signal in the @xmath113-@xmath114 curve at low bias .",
    "however , in the 2deg under high magnetic field , the absence of such a nonlinear @xmath113-@xmath114 curve was interpreted as the absence of the stripe ordering .",
    "different from the 2deg , in the case we studied here , the similar pinning effect would lead to oscillations for a system with stripe ordering , due to the absence of dissipation in ultracold dipolar gases .",
    "since a real system has a finite temperature , the contribution of the thermal fluctuations comes into play .",
    "their effects can be studied based on the symmetry - breaking pattern of the ordered phase . for a 2d system in the continuum , the homogeneous phase at @xmath115 has continuous translational and two - fold rotational symmetries ( rotation by @xmath116 ) at @xmath26 . for @xmath117 ,",
    "the stripe phase spontaneously breaks the continuous translational symmetry in one direction and leads to one gapless goldstone mode as required by symmetry . in a 2d system with @xmath117 ,",
    "if we increase the temperature from @xmath64 , such a goldstone mode will destroy the long - range order of the stripe phase .",
    "however , a quasi - long - range power - law correlation would still remain for temperature below a transition temperature @xmath118 @xcite . for @xmath119 , although the real - space density oscillation of the stripes is hard to observe due to the lack of a true long - range order , the density profile in fourier space will have two peaks located at @xmath102 which decays as a power - law function of @xmath120 . above @xmath118 , the correlation becomes short - ranged and the phase transition at @xmath121 belongs to the usual kosterlitz@xmath122thouless ( kt ) university class .    for dipolar molecules in a 2d optical lattice ,",
    "if the wavevector of the stripe phase is commensurate with the lattice wavevector , the stripe phase breaks no continuous symmetry and hence no gapless goldstone mode is present .",
    "therefore , the long - range order of the stripe phase remains at finite @xmath123 below a critical temperature @xmath124 .",
    "however , if the stripe phase is incommensurate with the underlying lattice , a kt transition is expected .    in the study of secs .",
    "[ sec:2d ] and [ sec:3d ] , we were focusing on on the susceptibility shown in eq . . effectively , this procedure is equivalent and closely related to the liner - response approximation .",
    "thus , the higher - order terms beyond the liner - response approximation were ignored in our study .",
    "these higher order terms are highly nontrivial and could become nonlocal at certain wave - vector . for example , the free energy contains terms proportional to @xmath125 or @xmath126 at @xmath127 , as shown in refs . @xcite and @xcite . although these terms could be studied perturbatively within certain approximations , there is no available technique to take care of them nonperturbatively in a general way . in general , the contributions of these higher order terms are non - universal . in the case of a second - order phase transition , from the homogeneous phase to the inhomogeneous phase , these higher order term are unimportant at low energy and hence all the conclusions above remains .",
    "however , if the transition is first order , their contributions could become dominant . for a system with short - range interactions only ,",
    "a first order transition is usually believed to leads to phase separation ( as in the liquid / gas - solid transition ) .",
    "however , it was also shown that a stripe phase was favored in the presence of long - range interactions like coulomb @xcite or dipolar interactions @xcite . in summary , we find that the 2d dipolar fermi gas undergoes a stripe ordering at large dipolar interaction strength , i.e. , the density wave instability at finite momentum , instead of phase separation . for the single component case ,",
    "this instability occurs regardless of the dipole orientation .",
    "this arises from the fact that the fourier transform of the dipolar interaction increases linearly with wavevector . for the multicomponent case , due to the short - range hartree interaction , the stripe instability only exists at @xmath100",
    "after the completion of first online version of the manuscript , we learned the work by yamaguchi _",
