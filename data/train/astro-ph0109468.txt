    "studying short time scale variability of the x - ray emission of black - hole systems and low - mass x - ray binaries is an important approach to understanding the emitting region and emission mechanism of high - energy photons .",
    "the time - averaged spectra of hard x - rays from cyg x-1 and other black - hole candidates are relatively well explained in terms of a simple model : hard x - rays result from the comptonization of soft photons in a hot electron cloud of constant temperature and optical depth ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "some properties of aperiodic variability of x - rays from cyg x-1 revealed by timing analysis , e.g. time lags ( @xcite ) and coherence ( @xcite ) between different energy bands , are difficult to interpret by the simple comptonization model and provide strong constraints on theoretical models , which are attracting an increasing amount of attention .",

    "in addition , the fourier transformation is sensitive to dead times and data gaps caused by various reasons ; and the window effect limits the performance of fourier technique in studying rapid variability in high frequency region .    without using the fourier transformation , we can also calculate quantities characterizing temporal property , e.g. , power density , time lag and coherence between different energy bands , and , furthermore , we can study the hardness ratio , variability duration and correlation between different quantities on different time scales directly in the time domain . in section 2",

    "3 ) , hard x - ray lag ( fig .",
    "11 ) , variation width ( figs .  12 , 13 ) , harness ratio and coherence of shot component ( fig .  7 and fig .",
    "9 ) are often different in the time scale regions of @xmath172  s , between 0.01 s and 0.1  s and @xmath1730.1  s. at all states of cyg x-1 in the short time scale region of @xmath174 s as the time scale decrease , the power density of x - ray variability decreases and coherence becomes weaker .",
    "there are some variability properties showing state dependent : e.g. in the short time scale region around @xmath175 s the variability duration of high - energy photons is shorter than that of low - energy photons in the transition states , but wider in the hard state , as is shown in fig",
    "these properties should be considered in the construction of emission models .",
    "it is obvious that a simple comptonization model , i.e. hard x - rays come from multiple inverse compton scattering of thermal photons in electron gas with high temperature , can not explain many of the temporal characteristics revealed by timing analysis in the time domain .",
    "the variability duration in high - energy band being shorter in the transition states of cyg x-1 is in contradiction to the expectation from the comptonization process .",
    "a natural explanation is that some seed photons of short pulses have energies already in the hard x - ray region and the property of high - energy pulses having shorter duration is an intrinsic character of seed pulses .",
    "it seems that the effect of spectrum , temporal property and production mechanism of such seed photons on the observed hard x - rays can not be ignored .",
    "the duration of short variability in high - energy band of cyg x-1 in the hard state is , as distinguished from the other states and just as expected by the comptonization process , wider than that in low - energy band . according to the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model , a large region of adaf with high temperature around the center black hole exists only in the hard state ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the effect of comptonization process should be most significant in the hard state . if this is true , then the difference of variation durations between the hard state and the other states reflects the geometry of the accretion region . in the long time scale region of @xmath176",
    "s , high - energy time delay increases with time scale up to above 10 ms , which is greater than the radial light crossing , sound crossing or free - fall time scales in adaf ( this result is consistent with time lags in low fourier frequency region from the fourier spectrum analysis , see @xcite ) .",
    "besides propagation in adaf , other processes , i.e. heating in accretion disc or adaf , should be considered in interpreting hard x - ray delay on long time scale . in summary , production of hard x - rays from black hole binaries",
    "may be related to geometric structure and physical properties of accretion region , as well as to multiple processes with different time scales .",
    "the timing technique in the time domain is an useful tool to expose their specific properties that are hard to be revealed by the fourier technique .",
    "the analysis technique in the time domain is far from being completed , it needs further developing in various aspects .",
    "we try to distinguish different components of emission with a simple procedure in the time domain .",
    "the fact that the shot and steady components resulted from our procedure have quite different distributions of hardness and coherence ( see fig . 7 and fig .",
    "9 ) , indicates that such a distinguishing is meaningful : they more or less correspond to different processes with different characters . in comparison with the values from total light curve , the hardness ratios of the shot component of cyg x-1 on the short time scale of @xmath177 s are always lower in the hard state and higher in other states , and the variability coherence of shot component is always weaker .",
    "the hardness and coherence of the steady component in each state of cyg x-1 are near to the values from the total light curve .",
    "these results should be conducive to searching and investigating different physical processes involved in x - ray emission .",
