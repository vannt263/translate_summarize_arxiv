    "@xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth of noticing that in contrast to the dirac case , the behavior of the transition probability in the majorana case is qualitatively similar for different matter densities and different magnetic fields [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , panels ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) ] .",
    "the problem of majorana neutrinos spin - flavor oscillations was studied in refs .",

    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the evolution equation for three neutrino flavors propagating inside a presupernova star with zero metallicity , e.g. , corresponding to w02z model  @xcite , was solved for the realistic matter and magnetic field profiles .",
    "although our analytical transition probability formula   is valid only for the constant matter density and magnetic field strength , it is interesting to compare our results with the numerical simulations of ref .  @xcite . in those calculations the authors used magnetic fields @xmath234 and magnetic moments @xmath235 that",
    "give us the magnetic energy @xmath236 .",
    "this value is the maximal magnetic energy used in our work .",

    "this big transition probability is due to the rsf - h and rsf - l resonances at the distance @xmath241 .",
    "even so that we study two neutrino oscillations scheme , we obtained the analogous behavior of @xmath226 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . however , in our case this big transition probability is due to the presence of the strong magnetic field ( see refs .",
    "we can not compare our transition probability formula   with the results of ref .",

    "we have studied in this work the propagation of massive flavor - mixed dirac and majorana particles in matter under the influence of an external magnetic field in an approach based on relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the magnetic moment matrix is assumed to be both in the dirac and majorana case nondiagonal in the mass eigenstate basis . starting with lorentz invariant wave equations , the interactions of neutrinos with matter and magnetic fields included , we derived the effective hamiltonians and solve the evolution equations for the electrically neutral matter with @xmath244 .",
    "we then found the probabilities for the spin - flavor oscillation @xmath218 ( @xmath245 for majorana neutrinos ) and examined their dependence on the matter density and the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "we also studied in our approach the evolution of mixed massive majorana neutrinos in vacuum , which is an exactly solvable problem .",
    "we derived the wave functions of the neutrinos and the transition probabilities for the process @xmath246 .",
    "we included the terms quadratic in neutrino masses and discussed the origin of these corrections of the standard formula for the probability .",
    "these corrections to the pontecorvo formula , see eq .",
    ", are rapidly oscillating functions suppressed by the ratio @xmath247 , which is small for the relativistic neutrinos .",
    "it was revealed in our previous works  @xcite that the analogous terms originate from the accurate account of the lorentz invariance in the study of oscillations of dirac neutrinos .",
    "it is also known that in describing of evolution of majorana neutrinos in vacuum the transitions of the types @xmath248 and @xmath249 are possible  @xcite , with the transition probability of the latter case being suppressed by the factor @xmath247 .",
    "the transitions @xmath250 can be interpreted as neutrino - to - antineutrino oscillations and manifest in the possible neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite . in our work on the basis of the relativistic quantum mechanics we derived the transition probability for neutrino - to - antineutrino oscillations which is consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our results can be used for analyzing the behavior of neutrinos in supernovae , in particular in the so - called zero metallicity presupernovae , where the condition @xmath244 is fulfilled  @xcite outside the si+o layer .",
    "it is known that these stars can possess very strong magnetic fields , up to @xmath251 , or even stronger  @xcite .",
    "we found that large rates of transitions that change neutrino flavors and chiralities are possible both in the dirac and majorana cases with a typical oscillation lengths of the order of @xmath148 for matter densities of the order of @xmath252 , for typical supernova neutrino energies of @xmath253 and for @xmath120 of the order of @xmath254 .",
    "the parameters of a shock wave , the density and width , can vary in a rather wide range , but typically they fit with the parameter values we used in our analysis  @xcite . in particular , the width of the shock wave can be of about the same size as the oscillation length of the spin - flavor oscillations .",
    "it would thus be possible that the transition probability achieves its maximum value ( can be as high as 0.8 in some cases ) when neutrinos pass through the shock wave on their way towards the outer layers of the star .",
    "if the flight distance were many oscillation lengths , the probability would be averaged to a smaller value .",
    "the results of our work can have the implication to the r - process nucleosynthesis since it is sensitive to the amount of neutrinos of various species emitted in a supernova  @xcite .    in the dirac case",
    "the maximum value of the transition probability is achieved for a specific value of @xmath120 , while in the majorana case the transition probability can be large for a wide range of @xmath120 values . supposing that the neutrino magnetic moment is @xmath255 , allowed by the present astrophysical and cosmological data  @xcite , the largest transition in the dirac case would occur when the strength of the magnetic field is in the range @xmath256 .",
    "although a magnetic field on the surface of a neutron star is typically stronger , @xmath257 , at outer parts of the envelope it may have a suitable value for a large transition to take place .",
    "the difference between the dynamics of dirac and majorana particles under the influence of the same external fields can be a smoking gun to reveal the nature of neutrinos .",
    "note that in the majority of the previous works devoted to the spin - flavor oscillations the analytical transition probability formulae were obtained only for majorana neutrinos .",
    "the case of dirac particles was studied only in connection with small off - diagonal magnetic moments .",
    "our work studies the opposite situation of big off - diagonal elements of the magnetic moments matrix .",
    "the effect of the appearance of the big transition probability at moderate magnetic field strength has never been described earlier . as for majorana neutrinos",
    "the enhancement of the transition probability in strong magnetic fields is in agreement with the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "note that spin - flavor oscillations of majorana neutrinos can be also resonantly enhanced in the moderate magnetic field , see ref .",
    "however this effect does not happen in isoscalar matter with @xmath258 .",
    "the condition for the resonant spin - flavor precession reads  @xcite , @xmath259 , which is not fulfilled in isoscalar matter .    the obtained analytical formulae for the transition probabilities , eqs .   and  , are valid in the important case when @xmath260 , which is realized in the zero metallicity presupernova stars . these kinds of stars were quite common for early stages of the galaxies formation .",
    "we obtained that spin - flavor oscillations of dirac neutrinos can be strongly influenced by the moderate magnetic field of a neutron star and the big transition probability can exist not only for majorana neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "thus spin - flavor oscillations of dirac neutrinos can significantly change the relic supernova neutrino background  @xcite .",
    "although now no signal of relic neutrinos was observed  @xcite , there are still some efforts to calculate the flux of relic @xmath261 for the kamland and super - kamiokande detectors  @xcite .",
    "the reliable simulation of the supernova explosion does not exist yet .",
    "for example , the propagation of a shock wave can significantly change magnitude and shape of the magnetic field which are very important in our calculations .",
