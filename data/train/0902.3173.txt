    "the term `` crackling noise '' @xcite refers to the signal that some disordered systems produce as a response to an external driving field smoothly changing in time . due to the presence of disorder , crackling signals are extremely irregular , despite the steady increase of the external forcing .",
    "they are typically characterized by a sequence of pulses of very different sizes and durations , separated by quiescence intervals .",
    "tiny events occur very frequently , while large ones are rare , with power laws probability distributions .    in this review",
    "we focus on one particular case of noise , the so called barkhausen noise ( bn ) , which is emitted by ferromagnetic materials during the magnetization reversal process @xcite .",
    "systems that `` crackle '' are found in many different situations , and , remarkably , the corresponding signals often share some common characteristic features .",
    "examples of crackling signals , besides bn , include the shear response of a granular media @xcite , the acoustic emission during martensitic phase transitions @xcite , the bursts of dislocations activity in plastic deformation @xcite , the dynamic of superconductors @xcite and superfluids @xcite , the fluctuations in the stock market @xcite , the dielectric polarization of ferroelectric materials @xcite , the acoustic emission in fractures @xcite , and the seismic activity in earthquakes @xcite .",
    "crackling noise signals are expected to encode information on the physical process that generates them .",
    "understanding the statistical properties of these jerky emissions , is therefore a step towards the understanding of the microscopic dynamics taking place in the system that crackles .",
    "moreover , the fact that very diverse systems behave in a remarkably similar manner , suggests that some general basic principle may exist in the underlying physics .",
    "if this is the case , then , understanding in detail one of them , may give insight to others , and propel other fields of research .",
    "bn can be seen as a case study , for which a satisfying picture is finally available .",
    "a main ingredient in this picture is a model of avalanche dynamics known as abbm model , named after the authors of the original papers , bruno alessandro , cinzia beatrice , giorgio bertotti and arianna montorsi , whose companion seminal papers @xcite , one devoted to the developing the theory , the other to the comparison with experiments , have represented a huge step forward in the understanding of bn .",
    "the abbm model , corresponds to a mean field description of an elastic magnetic wall moving in a disordered ferromagnet under the effect of an external driving field .",
    "the system is ultimately described by a simple langevin equation for the velocity of the center of mass of the wall .    despite its simplicity ,",
    "the abbm model is able to reproduce with striking accuracy most of the phenomenology observed in bn experiments on a large class of magnetic materials .",
    "moreover , thanks to a mapping onto a simple stochastic process , all the results concerning the noise statistics can be derived analytically , and have a clear and direct interpretation . in particular , this simple mean field description allows to explain the origin of the power law distributions of size and duration of pulses , both in the quasi ",
    "static limit , where the applied field variations are extremely slow , and at finite driving field rates . in this second case ,",
    "the model is also able to predict how these distributions depend on the driving field rate .",
    "a more refined analysis of the experimental data against theoretical predictions includes the comparison of the shape of the avalanches .",
    "this is where the abbm model unexpectedly fails , being unable to predict the characteristic leftward asymmetric form of bn pulses .",
    "the origin of this asymmetry lies in the non  instantaneous response of the eddy fields to the domain wall displacement . to understand and evaluate the effect of such delay , one as to take into account the dynamical effect of eddy currents in the maxwell equations for the eddy field .",
    "eddy currents retardation gives rise to an `` anti  inertial '' effect , that can be accounted for , to the first order , by associating a negative effective mass to the wall .",
    "once the effective mass is identified , the corresponding inertial term can be incorporated into the abbm equation of motion . the modified abbm model that comes out from this analysis gives a complete picture of the barkhausen effect , consistent with the phenomenological observations",
    ": it is still successful in reproducing the distribution of sizes and durations of pulses , and also correctly reproduces the asymmetry in their shape .",
    "it is interesting to underline the role of universality versus non universality in the theory of barkhausen effect .",
    "the standard statistical mechanics approach usually focuses on universal quantities .",
    "definitely , universality is a key and extremely powerful concept at the basis of this approach , as it allows to predict the essential behavior of self  similar systems by means of very simple models .",
    "this consideration indeed applies to the case of barkhausen noise , where , in analogy to critical phenomena , most of the statistical properties of the signals only depend on general properties of the system , while they are independent of the microscopic details : different magnetic samples respond to the forcing by an external field by producing events of magnetization reversal characterized by the same power law distributions , regardless of the specific microscopic structure of the material",
    ".    however , some interesting features of bn turn out to be of microscopic origin .",
    "although , consistently with universality , microscopic details would become negligible on extremely large scales , they have an unusually large effect in barkhausen signals , an effect that is still significant at the experimental scale .",
    "on one hand this can be seen as an inconvenient and a limitation of the methods of statistical mechanics , since it means that not all the relevant aspects of the phenomenon can be captured by simple models . on the other hand ,",
    "the identification of some macroscopic effect of the microscopic details , provides a mean to extract information on microscopic quantities by barkhausen measurements .",
    "the asymmetry of the pulses gives indeed a measure of this type .",
    "as an example , the skewness of the pulses measured as a function of the pulse duration shows a peak , that allows to identify a characteristic timescale for relaxation , which corresponds to the ratio between mass and damping constant .    in this review we will deal with both these aspects of the theory , in the attempt to put together a number of results achieved in recent years .",
    "we will also try to underline which points are still unclear and would need further analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : bn ] reviews some general facts about barkhausen noise .",
    "we start with a short historical note ( [ sec : history ] ) .",
    "then we discuss how magnetic materials are classified , in order to clarify to which ones the following theory applies ( [ sec : soft ] ) .",
    "we shortly describe the typical set  up and the problems arising in bn experiments in subsection [ sec : exp ] .",
    "bn phenomenology , as it comes out from experiments , is described in subsection [ sec : ph ] . in subsection",
    "[ sec : approach ] we discuss the two main theoretical approaches to bn that have been developed in recent times : one based on a microscopic description in terms of a random field ising model , the other describing the magnetization process in terms of the dynamic of magnetic interfaces , that will be further developed in the next section .    in section [ sec : abbm ] we focus on the second approach : first we introduce the abbm as a phenomenological model ( [ sec : abbm_abbm ] ) and underline its main limitations ( [ sec : limitations ] ) . to put the model in a more general framework",
    "we then briefly discuss the problem of the dynamic of a generic elastic interface in a random media ( [ sec : elastic_interface ] ) , and then we specialize to the case of a magnetic interface ( [ sec : mesoscopic ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this digression is to recover the abbm model as a mean field for a model of interface dynamic ( [ sec : mf ] ) , therefore corroborating its validity .",
    "section [ sec : rw ] is the core part of the paper : we show how the abbm equation is mapped onto a langevin equation describing a biased random walk in logarithmic potential with absorbing boundary conditions at the origin ( [ sec : rw_rw ] ) .",
    "this approach is amenable of analytical treatment and allows to work out exactly a number of properties , and to give a direct interpretation of the phenomenology observed in the experiments in terms of properties of the corresponding stochastic process ( [ sec : log ] ) .",
    "the power law distributions in avalanches sizes and durations can be exactly calculated in terms of distributions of return times to the origin ( [ sec : per ] ) .",
    "the continuous dependence of the exponents in the power law distributions on the driving field rate can also be calculated , and turns out to be related to the marginality of the logarithmic perturbation to the free random walk ( [ sec : mar ] ) .",
    "the existence of a threshold in the driving field rate can be derived from recurrence properties of a free random walk ( [ sec : rec ] ) , and the existence of a cut  off in the power law distributions can be associated to the bias term ( [ sec : bias ] ) .",
    "the average shape of the barkhausen pulse can be derived in terms of the excursion of the process ( [ sec : exc ] ) , and finally the power spectra can be derived from the process correlations ( [ sec : ps2 ] ) . in subsection",
    "[ sec : sum ] we summarize the abbm predictions and compare them with the phenomenological observations . in the last subsection ( [ sec : cutoff ] ) we discuss the scaling of the cut  offs with the demagnetizing factor .",
    "this scaling is not entirely captured by the mean field approximation , although it is predicted by the full elastic interface model in @xmath0 .",
    "section [ sec : rw ] collects a number of results , most of which , but not all , are spread in literature , but to which has never been given a comprehensive exposition in the bn framework before .",
    "some of these results have been indeed developed in an unrelated context , to deal with a completely different problem @xcite .",
    "for this reason in this part we made an effort to give a self  contained exposition .",
    "the issue of the asymmetry of barkhausen pulses ( that the abbm model is not able to reproduce ) is treated in section [ sec : asym ] : a characteristic leftward asymmetry in the average pulse shape is observed in experiments ( [ sec : asym_exp ] ) , which is due to the non  instantaneous response of the eddy currents field to the wall displacement ( [ sec : asym_eddy ] ) .",
    "the eddy current retardation gives rise to inertial effects , that are accounted for in a generalized abbm model by associating a negative effective mass to the domain wall ( [ sec : asym_abbm ] ) . in subsection",
    "[ sec : asym_geo ] we discuss how this non  universal effect is affected by the sample geometry , and , finally , in subsection [ sec : asym_comp ] we compare theory predictions and experiments .    in section [ sec : other ]",
    "we discuss some other crackling systems that may be tackled with an approach similar to the one used for the barkhausen effect : the case of the dynamic of a granular media under shear ( [ sec : granular ] ) , and the case of seismic activity during earthquakes ( [ sec : earth ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] and [ sec : ak ] are devoted to conclusions and acknowledgments respectively .",
    "barkhausen noise is probably one of the first crackling signals ever recorded . indeed",
    "the barkhausen effect has been known for almost a century : its first observation dates back in 1919 , when heinrich barkhausen noticed that  iron produces a noise when magnetized : as the magnetomotive force is smoothly varied [ ... ] it generates irregular induction pulses in a coil wound around the sample that can be heard as a noise in a telephone \" @xcite .",
    "= 9.5 cm    barkhausen s first experiment consisted in observing the variations of the magnetization in a ferromagnetic sample subject to a slowly and smoothly changing magnetic field .",
    "a pickup coil winded around the sample was used to detect the variations of the magnetization as schematically shown in figure [ setup ] .",
    "as the magnetization reverses , the variations of the magnetic flux induce a voltage in the coil , that indirectly measures the changes in the magnetization of the sample , and that may eventually be translated in real noise through an amplifier .",
    "the signal recorded in correspondence to jumps in the magnetization , appears to be very irregular , no matter how smooth is the variation of the external field .    nowadays , magneto  optical methods are also available , that allows a direct observations of moving domains , however , the most reliable experiments in terms of signal statistics are still based on inductive measurements . in order to be capable to record clean signals with reduced background noise and high statistic ,",
    "modern experimental settings make use of sophisticated equipments , however , the basic set  up for inductive bn experiments is conceptually still the same as the one shown in figure [ setup ] .",
    "barkhausen wondered about what could be the source of the signal emitted during the magnetization of the iron sample , and he mistakenly concluded that the sequence of pulses was generated by a corresponding sequence of sudden and complete reversals of entire magnetic domains . at that time",
    ", his experiment was indeed taken as the first indirect observation of magnetic domains , whose existence had been postulated a few years before ( 1907 ) by weiss @xcite .",
    "almost 20 years later ( 1938 ) elmore was able to perform an experiment on a cobalt crystal where the motion of domain boundaries was directly observed and measured for the first time @xcite .",
    "however elmore did not recognize this motion as the source of bn . only more then 10 years later ( 1949 ) , after another experiment by williams and shockley on a @xmath1 crystal @xcite , the origin of bn was finally ascribed to the correct cause , namely to the irregular fluctuations of magnetic domain boundaries , rather then to the sudden inversion of domains .",
    "this fact was definitely clarified in the same year by kittle in his fundamental review on the physical theory of ferromagnetic domains @xcite .",
    "a nice exposition of the first steps in the understanding and misunderstandings of barkhausen effect is given in a recent review by g. durin and s. zapperi @xcite , which also includes in appendix a translation from german to english of the original paper by h. barkhausen .    since its first observation ,",
    "a lot of work has been done in order to `` decode '' the barkhausen signal , both on the experimental side and on the theoretical one . for a long time",
    ", theoretical studies have been based on a phenomenological approach , which described the signal as a superposition of random elementary jumps .",
    "then , it became clear that bn could represent a powerful tool to investigate the magnetization process and the hysteretic properties on a microscopic scale , and much effort has been devoted in developing physically grounded models that could allow to relate the phenomenology to its microscopic origin .",
    "the theoretical studies have followed two kind of approaches : one based on a microscopic description in terms of spins in a random magnetic field ( see section [ sec : approach ] ) ; the other one , which is the one on which we will focus in this review , describes the system in terms of a fluctuating magnetic interface that moves under the action of the external field .",
    "the research on bn has been in part motivated , especially at the beginning , by the applications of barkhausen effect to material testing .",
    "barkhausen emissions are indeed commonly used to check in a non  destructive way the integrity of magnetic samples : the signal intensity is sensitive to the changes in material microstructure , and to the presence of residual stresses ( in magnetostrictive positive materials compressive stresses will decrease the intensity of barkhausen noise while tensile stresses will increase it ) .",
    "these properties make bn an efficient tool for the detection of micro  imperfections and for the evaluation and mapping of the local distribution of residual stresses @xcite .",
    "most of the recent research on the statistical properties of bn is however theoretically oriented , and primarily aimed to gain understanding on the hysteretic properties of ferromagnetic materials , and to investigate the magnetization reversal process on a microscopic scale .",
    "recently , further interest has been raised by the fact that many other driven dissipative systems have been found to respond to a smooth forcing in a disordered manner , with very similar and reproducible statistical features . to this kind of response",
    "has been given the general denomination of `` crackling noise '' . clearly , the irregular response is due to the presence of disorder in the system , and the challenge is to get information on the specific system under study by decoding the noise that it generates . as the recent encouraging advances in the understanding of",
    "bn compose a rather satisfying picture of the phenomenon , bn emerges as an attractive case study to understand crackling noise in general .",
    "the understanding of hysteretic properties of magnets has an interesting overlap with material science , and the theory that we describe has been built always keeping close contact with the experimental side . therefore , although the aim of this review is mainly theoretical , we believe that , in order to put in a correct framework the theory , understand its limitations , and to keep close the connection with the experimental counterpart , it is worth to discuss briefly how magnetic materials are classified , and to clarify to which ones this theory applies , and to which ones it does not .",
    "magnetic materials are roughly classified in soft and hard .",
    "soft magnets are those characterized by very tiny hysteresis loop , reflecting the fact that they are easily magnetized and demagnetized by applying relatively small fields .",
    "hard magnets are the exact opposite : they have very wide and squared hysteresis loops , and they need a big effort in terms of applied field in order to be magnetized and demagnetized .",
    "the two classes of magnets are quite well separated , and there is not much in between . a good quantitative measure of `` magnetic hardness '' , is given by the coercive field , which is the field needed to bring back to zero the magnetization of a saturated sample .",
    "this quantity differs , between soft and hard magnets , by several orders of magnitudes ( see figure [ hardsoft ] ) @xcite .",
    "the markedly different hysteretic behavior observed in the two classes of materials is due to the fact that the magnetization reversal proceeds by different mechanisms in the two cases .",
    "in soft magnets it is dominated , except than close to saturation , by the nucleation and displacement of magnetic walls .",
    "this is a process with low energetic cost , that translates into a small loop area , which measures the dissipated energy . on the other side , in hard magnets the wall nucleation and/or displacement",
    "is strongly impeded , or totally suppressed , and magnetization reversal by coherent spin rotation enters into play .",
    "hard magnets have highly anisotropic magnetic properties .",
    "they are usually composed from alloys containing rare earth elements ( typical ones are @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) . in single domain particle magnets",
    "the nucleation of domains is prevented by building samples made out of very small magnetic grains , whose size is comparable with the domain wall thickness , and each one with a random easy magnetization direction . due to the high anisotropy , the magnetization can only reverse by coherent spin rotation when the applied field is large enough to force the spins out of the easy magnetization direction .",
    "due to the high coercive field , hard magnets can not be accidentally demagnetized when subjected to small fields .",
    "also , they have a remanent magnetization very close to the saturation value , meaning that they are able to retain their magnetization when the applied field is removed .",
    "these properties are extremely desirable in the design of magnetic storage devices .",
    "examples of soft materials are iron ",
    "silicon alloys , crystalline iron  nickel alloys ( permalloys ) , and amorphous metallic alloys ( typical is the @xmath4 ) . applications of soft magnetic materials exploit the large flux changes obtained with a small change in the applied field , and the small energy loss .",
    "soft magnets are used for example in transformers , motors , and inductors , and also as field sensors in magnetic recording devices .",
    "the magnetization reversal in these materials is dominated by the low  cost process of magnetic domain displacement .",
    "domain walls , and the domain walls movement can be directly observed in experiments based on the magneto  optical kerr effect ( moke ) .",
    "reflection of a beam of linearly polarized light from the surface of a magnetized sample causes the polarization to become elliptical , with the principal axis rotated with respect to the incoming light , depending on the magnetization direction . an analyzing filter in the reflected beam",
    "is then used to generate magnetic domain contrast .    the theory described in this review",
    "is based on a mesoscopic description in terms of dynamics of domain walls , therefore it only applies to soft magnets .",
    "the magnetization reversal process in hard magnets is indeed worth of attention , however , in this case , a microscopic description in terms of spin models would be more appropriate . as it will be discussed in subsection",
    "[ sec : ph ] , soft materials have different statistical properties depending on the range of the interactions ruling the dynamics .",
    "the mean field theory which is the focus of this review applies to those with long range interactions .      in inductive experiments bn is detected by a pick  up coil wound around the ferromagnetic sample during the magnetization of the material , which takes place under the action of a varying external field @xmath5 .",
    "as the magnetization reverses in the sample , the variations of the magnetic flux @xmath6 , induce an electromotive force @xmath7 in the pick  up coil , which has a contribution from the applied field across the pick  up coil , and another one given by the magnetic field inside the material : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vacuum magnetic permeability , n is the number of coil turns @xmath10 is the coil cross section , @xmath11 is the sample cross section , and @xmath12 the magnetization .    in high susceptibility materials",
    "the contribution coming from the first term in equation ( [ picup ] ) can be neglected , since , as long as the susceptibility @xmath13 is much larger then @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material ) , the contribution from the magnetization rate @xmath16 is much larger then the one due to the variation of the applied field @xmath17 . to neglect the first term in equation ( [ picup ] ) , it is also necessary that the sample cross section @xmath11 is not too small with respect to the pick  up coil section @xmath18 .    in low susceptibility materials , or in cases where the condition @xmath19 is not easy to satisfy , as for example in the case of thin films ,",
    "it is possible to compensate the induced flux in air by using another pick  up coil with the same number of turns and cross section , but wound in the opposite direction .    with the eventual addition of the compensation coil",
    ", it can therefore always be assumed that the variation of the magnetic flux @xmath6 is approximately proportional to the rate of change of the magnetization : @xmath20    in the simplest experimental conditions , where there is just one domain wall separating two regions of opposite magnetization , the rate of change of @xmath12 is twice the magnetization of the region spanned per unit time . the volume of this region is given by @xmath21 in the geometry and notations of figure [ measure ] , and where @xmath22 is the average wall displacement velocity .",
    "this volume , times the magnetization per unit volume @xmath23 , gives the magnetization rate @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "therefore , the induced voltage @xmath7 measured by the pick  up coil is just proportional to the wall velocity @xmath22 : @xmath26    note that the sample thickness @xmath27 in the direction perpendicular to the wall movement and to the coil axis is the only geometrical parameter that enters in the intensity of the bn signal .",
    "the number of turns in the pick  up coil amplifies the signal by a factor @xmath28 , thus one could be tempted to use wide detection coils .",
    "however , we stress that this is not a good choice : the magnetostatic field produces a counterfield which has a crucial role in the domain wall dynamics .",
    "this counterfield depends on sample geometry and domain structure , and it is homogeneous only in special geometries .",
    "however it is convenient to assume it to be constant also in more general cases .",
    "this is a good approximation only as long as one limits the region of the pick  up coil .    in the more complex case where several domain walls are present",
    ", the signal encodes the complex collective effect of many interacting domains . in this case the quantity @xmath22 in equation ( [ v ] ) approximately measure the velocity of the active walls .    due to the presence of various types of disorder , like non  magnetic inclusions and dislocations , the wall movement is discontinuous , since the disorder locations act as pinning points . as the external field",
    "is smoothly increased , the magnetization changes in steps , in correspondence to jumps of the magnetic interface , or , in microscopic terms , in correspondence to avalanches of spin flips .",
    "the hysteresis loops is also discontinuous , and the signal , which is proportional to the derivative of the magnetization , plotted versus time , looks like a disordered series of pulses ( see figure [ barkhausen ] ) .",
    "note that , in identifying the barkhausen signal with the derivative of the hysteresis curve , we are assuming that the applied field @xmath5 is increased linearly in time : indeed , in bn measurements , often  but not always  a driving field with a triangular time profile is applied , instead of one with the sinusoidal shape commonly used in hysteresis experiments . in this case",
    ", the variations of magnetization with respect to the applied field are directly translated in derivatives with respect to time .",
    "there exists a vast literature reporting results and data about bn experiments in soft materials .",
    "however , not all the data collected are reliable when one is interested in statistically analyzing and modeling the self  similar properties of the noise , as the details of the experimental procedure may have a serious impact on the quality of the signal .",
    "unfortunately , the need to establish a standard in the experimental set  up that could allow a rigorous comparison of the data , has been recognized as an important issue only in recent times .    the most relevant factor to take into account in order to ensure",
    "a reliable noise signal is to ascertain the stationarity during the dynamics .",
    "this question is crucial , since non  stationarity strongly biases the scaling of the avalanches distributions .",
    "however , it is not always easy to check whether the system is in a stationary state or not .    in the context of bn",
    ", the statistical properties of the signal strongly depend on the region of the hysteresis loop where the measure is recorded .",
    "this question was first raised by bertotti and fiorillo @xcite , who suggested to restrict the measures to the part of the loop corresponding to constant average permeability , where the condition of stationarity is guaranteed .",
    "this important point has however been disregarded in many experimental studies .",
    "= 12.5 cm    when collecting bn data , it is indeed crucial to take into account that the barkhausen signal is stationary only in the linear region around the hysteresis loop , where the intensity of the applied field is close to the coercive field value ( see figure [ stationar ] ) .",
    "this is precisely the region where the domain wall displacement is the dominating if not the unique mechanism involved in the magnetization reversal process . getting closer to saturation ,",
    "other mechanisms enter into play , as the spins , which during the previous phase of the magnetization process stay parallel to the easy magnetization axis , start to coherently rotate in order to align to the external field ( see figure [ magnetiz_reversal ] ) .",
    "experimental studies that do not take this point into account , and average barkhausen signals over the whole hysteresis loop , will mix the effect of the different magnetization mechanisms and of different dynamical conditions , making very difficult to attribute to the corresponding data a clear physical interpretation .",
    "= 12.5 cm    the role of stationarity has been recently further analyzed in great detail by durin and zapperi @xcite . in their work",
    "they show both with simulations and experiments that in non  stationary conditions the distributions of avalanches , being integrated over different values of the control parameters , are characterized by larger effective exponents .",
    "this might explain some experimental results which give unusually large values for the exponents in the power law distributions of sizes and durations of avalanches @xcite .",
    "evaluating the effects of non  stationary conditions on the statistical behavior of a system is an issue that arises in many driven non  equilibrium situations , and is analyzed in a more general context in @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the data from many barkhausen experiments reported in literature is given by durin and zapperi in their review @xcite , where the reliability of each experiment considered is also discussed .",
    "bn has some remarkable statistical properties , that are nowadays measured with great precision in experiments .",
    "we briefly report the main experimental results here .",
    "the amplitude @xmath7 of the bn signal , i. e. the instantaneous value of the voltage , is found to follow a distribution well fitted by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is proportional to the driving field rate , and @xmath31 is some characteristic cut  off value ( see figure [ pv ] ) .",
    "the amplitude distribution of the signal is an average quantity over avalanches . to go more into detail , and investigate the statistical properties of the single avalanches ,",
    "it is necessary to define precisely where a jump starts and ends .",
    "this is commonly done by fixing a threshold value , which can not be strictly zero due to the unavoidable presence of background noise ( see figures [ size ] , [ duration ] ) . that of signal thresholding is however a very complicated issue , which arises in many cases when one has to analyze temporal series , and that would need further attention .",
    "the choice of the threshold is crucial , since it defines the objects whose statistical properties one is looking at , and the absence of a clear rule makes the identification of single pulses rather ambiguous . on the other hand ,",
    "signal thresholding is inescapable if one wants to analyze directly experimental time series , it would therefore be desirable to be able at least to control its effects on the measured quantities .",
    "an alternative approach to the statistical analysis of the signals , which bypasses completely ambiguous thresholding methods , is to focus on the spectral properties , which indicate temporal correlations in the system , and then try to infer from there the statistical properties of the avalanches .",
    "this is indeed possible in some cases thanks to the fact that the power spectra exponents are related to the exponents in the size and time distribution of pulses as it was shown by kuntz and sethna @xcite for the random field ising model and some of its variants , and by laurson , alava , and zapperi @xcite for the case of sand piles .    in the case of bn",
    ", the experimental data have been shown to be relatively insensitive to the exact choice of the threshold @xcite .",
    "background noise limits the detection of small avalanches . choosing the threshold below its typical amplitude would result in over  estimating very small avalanches , but it is expected not to affect sensibly the rest of their distribution . the characteristic signal amplitude @xmath31 in equation ( [ v_dist ] ) gives a good reference value for the threshold , which is usually taken between @xmath32 and @xmath33 of @xmath31 .      once the pulses are well defined one can look at the statistics of their sizes and durations . by drawing an histogram it appears that they are also both characterized by power law distributions , limited by an exponential cut  off : the probability of having a pulse of a given size has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is some scaling function that accounts for the cut  off , and @xmath36 is some characteristic avalanche size .",
    "the distribution of durations has a similar behavior : the probability of having a pulse of duration @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where again @xmath39 is some characteristic time , and @xmath40 accounts for the exponential cut  off .      by repeating bn experiments on different samples of different materials and in different external conditions",
    ", it has been observed that the exponents characterizing the power law distributions are universal , and tend to cluster around two sets of values ( see figure [ pspt_lrsr ] ) @xcite . in soft magnets , this allows to identify two distinct universality classes , which are named _ long range _ and _ short range _ , according to the kind of elastic interaction which dominates the behavior of the magnetic walls .",
    "the two classes are characterized by exponents that , in the zero frequency limit of the applied field , take the values @xmath41 , @xmath42 for materials in the long range class , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 for those in the short range class , respectively for the avalanches sizes and durations distributions ( see figure [ pspt_lrsr ] ) .",
    "typical materials belonging to the long range class are polycrystalline @xmath1 with high @xmath45 content , and partially crystallized @xmath46 amorphous alloys . short range behavior is observed for instance on perminvar ( @xmath47 ) and amorphous alloys with composition @xmath48 under tensile stress .",
    "we will restrict here to materials belonging to the long range class , since for these systems the mean field description given by the abbm model , which is the focus of this review , turns out to be exact for universal properties at long length and time scales ( see section [ sec : mf ] ) .",
    "the values @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the long range elasticity class , refer to experiments performed in the quasi ",

    "it is observed that , above some well defined threshold , the typical intermittent behavior is lost , single pulses disappear , and the magnetization reverses in a unique avalanche .",
    "this is a sort of meta  phase transition , which separates two completely different regimes of the dynamics",
    ". it would be interesting to see how the system approaches the critical driving rate , by monitoring for example the quiescence times separating the avalanches as @xmath30 approaches the threshold value .",
    "this , to our knowledge , has never been done .",
    "a similar situation arises for example in sheared granular matter , where a threshold driving separates the stick  slip form the sliding regime .",
    "this effect is due to avalanches overlapping aver time : since at finite driving rates the external field increases during the avalanche , it can keep active an avalanche that would have stopped otherwise ( see subsection [ sec : mar ] and the paper by white and dahmen @xcite ) .",
    "the power law distributions of sizes and durations of avalanches are limited by an exponential cut  off , which turns out to be related to the demagnetizing field ( see subsection [ sec : bias ] ) , which in its turn depends on the sample geometry .",

    "measuring the strength of the demagnetizing field is very difficult , also due to the further dependence of the distribution on the driving rate .",

    "this quantity was recently proposed in @xcite to test theory against experiments , and indeed it provides a much stringent tool than the simple comparison of scalar quantities , such as critical exponents .    as shown in figure [ shape ] , which reports data from a bn experiment on a polycrystalline @xmath1 sample",
    ", the rescaling of experimental pulses can approximately be performed .",
    "as we will see , the shape of the scaling function is influenced by some non  universal effects that however disappear , as expected , on very long time scales .      in most of earlier literature ,",

    "the spectrum is characterized by the presence of a maximum .",
    "the position of the peak depends on the driving field rate @xmath30 : it occurs at a frequency @xmath66 roughly proportional to @xmath67 , and with an amplitude @xmath68 that scales as @xmath30 in the intermittent regime ( slow driving ) , while it is roughly constant in the continuous regime ( fast driving)(see figure [ pws_b_c ] where @xmath69 is plotted versus @xmath30 ) .",

    "the power spectrum has been claimed to behave like some power @xmath71 , with approximately @xmath72 .",
    "however , these claims are based on fits of data that are spread on less than one decade , and therefore are not conclusive .",
    "although the large @xmath64 tail and the existence of the peak are reproduced by the theory , the correct interpretation of all the details in the complex behavior of the frequency spectrum still represents a challenging problem . in principle the contributions from the correlations among different avalanches , and that from the correlations within avalanches are mixed together in the power spectrum , which therefore is not easily amenable of physical interpretation .",
    "some authors have also considered higher order spectra to further characterize the bn signal @xcite . in principle",
    "this analysis could indicate whether events on a certain scale would systematically precede events on another scale .",

    "recent theoretical studies on bn have moved from a pure phenomenological description , where bn is considered as a superposition of elementary events , without any connection to the microscopic dynamic , to more physical and detailed descriptions which take into account the relevant interactions governing the dynamics of the magnetization reversal process .",
    "the theory has then developed on two different but related avenues : one follows a microscopic description and models the magnetic system through interacting spins . in this framework ,",
    "the criticality observed in bn experiment is explained in terms of the proximity of a disorder driven non  equilibrium phase transition , which is observed in the zero temperature random field ising model ( rfim ) .",
    "the other approach describes the magnetization process in mesoscopic terms , through the dynamics of the domain walls . in this case , the criticality is related to the depinning transition occurring when the applied field overcomes a critical threshold value .",
    "we will briefly discuss here the first approach , and refer to the next sections for the second one , which is the one taken in this is review .    the attempt to model",
    "the barkhausen phenomenon in terms of spin models is indeed appealing .",
    "thanks to universality on expects the statistical properties of bn to be independent of the microscopic details of the system , provided that the relevant symmetries of the problem are properly taken into account .",
    "this allows in principle to derive macroscopic properties without going through the analysis of complicated micromagnetic equations , which are very difficult to treat analytically . instead , one models the avalanche dynamics with simplified rules for the evolution of integer valued spins .",
    "this approach allows both to perform large scale simulations , and to derive some theoretical result .    in particular , among all the spin models , the non  equilibrium random field ising model ( rfim ) , proposed by sethna _",
    "@xcite as a model for avalanche dynamics in bn , has been widely studied both analytically and numerically @xcite . in this model integer",
    "valued spins @xmath79 are assigned to each site of a @xmath80dimensional lattice , and interact with the nearest neighbors through a ferromagnetic coupling @xmath81 .",
    "the spins are coupled to the external field @xmath82 , and to a quenched random field @xmath83 extracted from a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath84 , which is associated to each site of the lattice , and is supposed to mimic the presence of disorder .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath85 where the first sum is restricted to the nearest neighbors . in the non  equilibrium zero temperature dynamics proposed by sethna and co ",
    "workers @xcite , at each time step the spins align with the local field : @xmath86 where , again , the first sum is restricted to the nearest neighbors of the spin @xmath87 . starting from a configuration with all the spins down ,",
    "the field @xmath82 is slowly ramped from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "a single spin flip can cause nearest neighboring spins to flip , and trigger an avalanche . in the quasistatic limit",
    "the field @xmath5 is kept constant during the avalanches .    for small values of @xmath84 ,",
    "the random field is not strong enough to stop the avalanches , and the hysteresis loop has a squared shape , with a large jump at a critical field @xmath90 at which the big avalanche starts .",
    "when @xmath84 is large , only small avalanches are observed : essentially every spin flips independently when @xmath5 is large enough to overcome the local pinning field @xmath83 , plus the comparably small energetic contribution from the coupling @xmath81 with the neighboring spins .",
    "the two regimes are separated by a critical value @xmath91 of the variance of the random field , for which the avalanches are power  law distributed .",
    "this model predicts that for the critical value of the disorder @xmath92 , at the critical point , in @xmath0 , and in the quasi ",
    "static limit , the exponents in the power  law distributions of size and duration of the avalanches are given by @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "these values have been obtained both by large scale numerical simulations @xcite , and with an epsilon expansion around the mean field solution , that has been be worked out analytically @xcite .",
    "the main problem with this approach is that rfim predicts scaling only at a critical value of the disorder , while there is not reason to expect this condition to be satisfied in experiments .",
    "another problem is that the results for the critical exponents in the non  equilibrium rfim are only marginally compatible with the values observed in experiments , where the exponents are around @xmath95 , @xmath42 , or @xmath43 , @xmath44 depending on the range of dipolar interactions .    more importantly ,",
    "even a rough investigation of the qualitative behavior of the non  equilibrium rfim shows that the domain structure is very different from the one observed in real magnets ( see figure [ domains ] ) . while in the rfim avalanches nucleate in different points of the system and grow with a fractal spatial structure , in real soft magnets domain walls are rather flat @xcite .    in the rfim",
    "the magnetization proceeds simultaneously by two different mechanisms , nucleation and wall displacement , while in real soft magnets ( and in the central part of the loop , where bn is measured ) the wall movement is the only relevant mechanism of magnetization reversal : the dynamic evolves by the motion of existing boundaries , rather then by nucleating new domains . as a consequence , the rfim ,",
    "as it is , is inadequate as a model for bn in soft magnets , while it could be an interesting starting point to describe magnetization dynamics in hard magnetic materials .",
    "the non  equilibrium rfim neglects dipolar interactions , which originates , both from free dipoles which are present on the sample surface , and from those on the magnetic interface .",
    "magnetostatic dipolar interactions due to the presence of `` free magnetic charges '' on the sample boundaries , generate a long range demagnetizing field , which opposes the external applied field .",
    "the most relevant ingredient missing in the rfim is indeed the demagnetizing field , which reflects in the flat domain domain structure observed in soft materials ( see figure [ domains ] ) , very different from the structure found in the rfim , where demagnetizing forces are not taken into account .",
    "the other crucial effect of the demagnetizing field , as we discuss below , is that it prevents the formation of large avalanches .",
    "several variants of the rfim have been proposed to overcome these problems .",
    "a particularly successful one , the front propagation model ( fpm ) , originally introduced in @xcite , has been extensively analyzed in @xcite as a model for bn . in this variant of the rfim ,",
    "the dynamics is such that only spins close to an existing domin boundary take part to the dynamics , while spins not adjacent to an avalanche front are prohibited to flip , even when it would be energetically favorable , so that the nucleation of new domains is totally suppressed .",
    "this can also be implemented by introducing in the rfim hamiltonian a long range term mimicking the demagnetizing field .",
    "the fpm gives exponents @xmath96 , and @xmath97 in @xmath0 , which are compatible with bn experiments for soft magnets in the short range universality class .",
    "it has to be stressed that , unlike the rfim , the fpm exhibits critical behavior in the whole low disorder regime @xmath98 and not just at the critical value @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , the demagnetizing field opposes the reversal process and forbids the magnetization to change abruptly , as it is the case , below @xmath91 , in the original non  equilibrium rfim : the demagnetizing field reduces the effective field until it stops the domain growth , which will start again with a new avalanche only by the increase of the external field .",
    "this mechanism will be treated extensively in the next section .",
    "the criticality observed is therefore not related to the disorder induced transition of the non  equilibrium rfim , but to a depinning transition .",
    "dipolar interactions between free dipoles on the magnetic wall produce an effective elasticity between different parts of the domain wall , that can be short range or long range , depending on the material .",
    "the long range elastic interaction has been claimed to lower the upper critical dimension to d=3 @xcite . in such materials ,",
    "a mean field approximation is therefore expected to apply . in mean field ,",
    "the front propagation model gives @xmath99 , in good agreement with experiment on materials in the long range universality class .",
    "another point that should be considered carefully in any rfim approach to bn regards the kind of disorder it represents , since random fields are not present in real magnets .",
    "it is therefore crucial to understand whether the rfim non  equilibrium phase transition represents a broad enough universality class that is preserved when other kinds of disorder are introduced .",
    "this question is still controversial .",
    "several studies have attempted to understand by numerical simulations whether other disordered spin models belong to the same universality class as the rfim .",
    "examples include the non  equilibrium random bond ising model ( rbim ) , with hamiltonian @xmath100 where the disorder enters into the exchange couplings @xmath101 , and the non  equilibrium site diluted ising model ( sdim ) , described by @xmath102 where the quenched variables @xmath103 , taking the values @xmath104 $ ] , indicate whether a given site represents a magnetic spin or not , thus modeling the presence of non  magnetic inclusions in the material .",
    "simulations show that both the non - equilibrium rbim @xcite and the non  equilibrium sdim @xcite exhibit a disorder induced phase transition , with a behavior qualitatively similar to that arising in the rfim .",
    "the critical exponents for the avalanche dynamics differ slightly , but are compatible , with those of the rfim , suggesting that rfim may indeed represent a broad universality class .",
    "the robustness of rfim with respect to different kinds of disorder is also discussed by dahmen and sethna in @xcite , where it is argued that universality is expected to hold on the base of renormalization group calculations .",
    "the authors suggest that although rbim and the random anisotropy model have higher symmetries then the rfim in equilibrium , they have the same symmetries in non  equilibrium conditions , since the external field at the critical point breaks the up  down symmetry .    to conclude our short discussion of spin models",
    ", we can summarize that the simple rfim is inadequate to describe the barkhausen effect in soft magnets , rather it could be a good starting point to model magnetization reversal process in hard magnets .",
    "the fpm , obtained from the rfim by incorporating the demagnetizing field , and suppressing domains nucleation , is instead a more adequate spin model for soft magnets , and give results in good agreement with experiments on materials in the short range universality class for @xmath0 , and for the long range in mean field .",
    "it is however very important to stress that in the fpm , the observed critical behavior is not related to the proximity of the rfim non  equilibrium critical point ( indeed criticality is observed for all @xmath98 , i.e. in the whole low disorder regime ) , but rather to the depinning transition of the magnetic interface that will be discussed extensively in the next sections .    in some sense",
    "spin models can be more general then interface models , as can easily deal for example with interface overhangs , however , in the case of soft magnets , given the nature of the transition , a simplified approach in terms of domain wall dynamics , seems more convenient , and has the advantage to allow to treat separately domain wall propagation and nucleation .",
    "the fpm naturally provides a discretized way to implement the front dynamics , very suitable for simulations .",
    "an alternative approach , which we follow in this review , is to formulate directly an equation of motion for the propagating wall .",
    "the first important theoretical approach to bn was done in 1990 by alessandro , beatrice , bertotti , and montorsi , who proposed a phenomenological model , which was then named after the authors of the two companion papers @xcite , one dealing with theory , the other with experiments . by  passing all the difficulties that appear when trying to approach the problem from basic micromagnetic equations , alessandro _",
    "et al . _ managed to capture the essential ingredients at the origin of bn , by formulating a very simplified equation for the domain wall dynamics .",
    "their model turned then out to be extremely successful in reproducing the experimental observations , and played a fundamental role in most of the successive theoretical progress , and in the development of a consistent theory for bn .",
    "the abbm model was inspired by the work of nel @xcite , who was the first to introduce a random energy model in the study of hysteresis : in nel s model , the complex domain structure usually present in a magnetized sample is replaced by a single domain wall , moving in a random energy landscape , which is supposed to account for all the interactions among walls , and of the walls with the medium .",
    "the energy profile is constructed with a sequence of equispaced parabolic arcs , whose curvatures are extracted from a gaussian distribution , in such a way that , on small scales , the motion is reversible , while , on large scales , the wall moves in random irreversible jumps .",
    "this model was introduced to explain in simple terms the rayleigh law in hysteresis .    in the alessandro _",
    "_ approach , the idea of a random energy landscape is generalized , and used to construct a stochastic equation for the domain wall dynamics , in order to describe the barkhausen effect .",
    "the equation is derived by following a previous work by williams _",
    "@xcite , who studied the dynamics of a single domain wall under an external field in a @xmath1 single crystal sample . in this work ,",
    "the motion of the wall , limited by eddy currents damping , was described by a linear relation between the average velocity and the net field acting on the interface , given by the difference between the applied field @xmath5 and some threshold field @xmath105 , which includes all kinds of random ( like interaction with pinning centers ) and non  random ( like dipolar forces and demagnetizing fields ) interactions ( see figure [ pinning ] ) .",
    "the abbm model is derived by making a more stringent claim , namely by assuming that the linear relation between velocity and effective fields holds not only on average , but also on the instantaneous velocity . by separating in @xmath105 the random contribution of the pinning field @xmath106 from the demagnetizing component @xmath107 ,",
    "one could then write @xmath108    the further assumption is that the pinning field is brownian correlated ( see eq .",
    "[ brownian_correlation ] below ) , as suggested by some experimental evidence in special system containing just one active wall @xcite .",
    "let us point out that this assumption is quite crucial , since an uncorrelated pinning field , as the one considered in the original work by nel , would not give rise to power law distributed magnetization events .    in the following section we will first describe the abbm equation , as it was formulated in @xcite .",
    "then , in order to put this model in a more general framework , we turn to the description of the dynamics of a magnetic elastic interface in a random media .",
    "following @xcite , we describe a depinning interface model for bn , that in the mean field approximation gives back the abbm model @xcite .",
    "as we will see , this will also clarify the origin of the correlated effective pinning field .",
    "the abbm theory assumes that there is just one single rigid wall separating two domains of opposite magnetization .",
    "the system has therefore just one degree of freedom , and the dynamics is described in terms of a one  dimensional equation of motion for the center of mass of the wall .",
    "the wall moves under the action of an applied driving field in an effective brownian correlated pinning field , mimicking the presence of disorder in the sample , as discussed above .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose the origin of the coordinate indicating the position of the wall at the center of the sample , i.e. at the zero magnetization domain configuration , so that , in what follows , the magnetization is proportional to the position of the wall .",
    "the equation of motion for the center of mass of the wall is then an equation for the magnetization .",
    "the motion is assumed to be overdamped , so that the velocity of the wall , which is proportional to the derivative of the magnetization , is equal to the sum of the forces acting on the interface , with a damping coefficient @xmath109 , characterizing the amount of dissipation : @xmath110    as mentioned before , the total force acting on the wall , on the r.h.s . of the equation , includes two terms , besides the time",
    " dependent applied magnetic field @xmath5 , as in equation ( [ abbm_0 ] ) .",
    "one is the demagnetizing field @xmath107 generated by free magnetic charges on the boundary of the sample , which opposes the external field and here is assumed to be proportional to the magnetization @xmath111 , through a constant @xmath55 ( _ demagnetizing factor _ ) that takes into account the geometry of the sample .",
    "the other one is the random pinning field @xmath112 , which accounts for defects and non ",
    "magnetic impurities present in the sample , and it is assumed to be brownian correlated in the magnetization : @xmath113      the abbm model has the advantage to be exactly solvable , and to reproduce with striking accuracy most of the statistical properties observed in the experiments for soft magnetic materials in the long range universality class , described in section [ sec : ph ] . however , it is worth to underline its main limitations .",
    "one , that we will deal with in the last part of the review ( see section [ sec : asym ] ) , is that it is unable to reproduce some features of non  universal origin , in particular , the asymmetric shape of barkhausen pulses .",
    "another important limitation of the abbm model is that it deals with a single domain wall , while in common experiments more interacting domains are present in the specimen and participate in the magnetization process .",
    "the abbm predictions on the signal power spectra are for example cleanly observed in experiment where a single domain wall is present @xcite , while other experiments suggest that the power spectra changes when more domains are present @xcite . to fully understand these experiments a model which includes many interacting domain walls would be needed .",
    "this point was indeed raised in the original paper @xcite , where the authors argue that in the case of many interacting domains , the same equation of motion approximately holds , once the correlation associated to the pinning field ( see the discussion in section [ sec : ps2 ] ) is multiplied by the number of active walls .",
    "another feature of bn for which the description in terms of the abbm model is unsatisfactory is the partial signal reproducibility observed in some experiments @xcite , that could be due to small variations in the initial conditions or in the driving field rate or in the peak field , or to thermal effects .",
    "a model able to describe this behavior should treat many interacting degrees of freedom explicitly , and not in an effective manner as in the abbm model .    a comparison point to point between abbm model predictions and the experimental evidences , which are summarized in subsection [ sec : sum_p ] ,",
    "is postponed to subsection [ sec : sum ] .",
    "an analysis of the barkhausen phenomenon at a mesoscopic level is done by describing the system as an elastic interface in a random media driven by an external field , and relates the criticality observed in the experiments to the well known _",
    "depinning transition _ of the interface .",
    "the response of an elastic manifold in a random media to an external driving force is a well studied problem in statistical physics , that arises in many contexts , for example in the study of fluids in porous media @xcite , flux lines in type ii superconductors @xcite , charge density waves @xcite , and crack fronts in solids @xcite . in the following we briefly review the main facts , for the case of a @xmath114 interface in @xmath27 dimensions , and refer to the extended literature for more details @xcite .    assuming that the motion is overdamped , so that inertial effects may be neglected , the general equation describing the dynamics of an elastic interface in a quenched random media , is obtained by equating the damping term to the total force acting on the interface : @xmath115 where , assuming that there are no overhangs",
    ", @xmath116 defines the position of the interface as a function of the @xmath114 dimensional coordinate @xmath117 on the substrate plane , and of time @xmath61 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath109 is the damping coefficient , ruling the rate of dissipation .",
    "the simplest equation of motion for an interface in an isotropic medium is the quenched edward wilkinson equation in a driving field , given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a uniform , eventually time dependent , applied force , @xmath120 is the elastic term , whose coefficient @xmath121 is the surface tension , and @xmath122 is the noise term , that mimics the presence of quenched disorder in the system .",
    "we consider here the zero temperature limit , where thermal noise is negligible with respect to quenched noise .",
    "a more general equation should include a kinematically generated nonlinearity of the kardar  parisi ",
    "zhang type , which changes the asymptotic scaling .",
    "however this term vanishes at the critical point and therefore eq . [ depinning ] is expected to have the correct critical behavior at the depinning transition ( see below ) .",
    "the quenched disorder is described by a random potential @xmath123 , whose derivatives gives the local pinning field @xmath122 in equation ( [ depinning ] ) . in @xmath0 , if @xmath124 are the coordinates of the point - like defects , and @xmath125 , then the random force is @xmath126 where the sum runs over the pinning points . here",
    "we assume the random noise to be uncorrelated and gaussian distributed , so that @xmath127    systems described by equation ( [ depinning ] ) exhibit a second order dynamic phase transition , called the depinning transition .",
    "the order parameter is the velocity of the interface , and the control parameter is the applied force , that we assume uniform and perpendicular to the substrate plane .",
    "the behavior of the system is sketched in figure [ fdepinning ] . at small",
    "applied forces the interface is locked by the pinning potential and @xmath128 . at some threshold value",
    "@xmath129 the force overcomes the pinning . for @xmath130 the interface moves with constant velocity . just above the threshold value @xmath129 the interface moves in power law",
    "distributed jumps .      in the case of a magnetic wall ,",
    "the interface separates two domains with opposite magnetization .",
    "when an external field @xmath131 is applied , the system tends to increase the domain with the largest component of the magnetization in the direction of the field , by domain wall displacement .",
    "thus the field @xmath131 acts as an effective force perpendicular to the wall , as shown schematically in figure [ maginterf ] , and we can replace @xmath119 with @xmath131 in equation ( [ depinning ] ) .    unlike many other cases where an elastic interface is driven in a disordered media , magnetic systems do not generally experience a depinning transition of the kind predicted by equation ( [ depinning ] ) and described in the previous section .",
    "this is due to the presence of other important interactions peculiar to the magnetic case , that modify the behavior of the interface in an essential way .    a first important step to adapt the general theory of elastic interfaces in random media in order to take into account the magnetic nature of the interactions",
    "was done by urbach , madison , and markert @xcite who modified equation ( [ depinning ] ) to include the effect of the demagnetizing field ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the demagnetizing field is the field generated by the presence of free magnetic charges on the boundaries of the sample ( see figure [ freecharges](a ) ) .",
    "it opposes the applied field , and it is roughly proportional to the magnetization of the sample .",
    "the demagnetizing field is assumed , as in the abbm model , to be of the form @xmath132 , uniform and proportional to the magnetization , where the _ demagnetizing factor _ @xmath55 takes into account the geometry of the sample . from micro - magnetic calculations",
    "it can be shown that the assumption of a uniform demagnetizing field is strictly correct only in ellipsoidal geometries , however , it turns out to be a good approximation also in more general cases .",
    "the addition of the demagnetizing field to the equation of motion has a crucial effect on the dynamics , since it provides the restoring force needed to keep the interface constantly at criticality . without this term",
    "the system would be critical just at a threshold value of the applied magnetic field , and experience a true depinning transition , while , in bn experiments , criticality is observed in an entire range of values of @xmath5 around the coercive field .",
    "these range of values correspond to the linear region of the hysteresis loop , which is precisely where the magnetization reversal is dominated by domain wall motion .",
    "the drastic effect of the demagnetizing field on the behavior of the system is confirmed by performing experiments in particular geometries , as barkhausen measurements on toroidal samples . in this case",
    "closed interfaces can be forced so that , due to the absence of free magnetic charges on the boundaries , the demagnetizing factor is zero , and indeed , a true depinning transition is observed .",
    "this behavior has first been observed on a @xmath1 single crystal in a frame geometry @xcite , and later on several other materials @xcite . in any other geometry , where @xmath133 , the equation of motion for the interface has to be modified with respect to equation ( [ depinning ] ) by replacing the applied force @xmath134 not just with the applied field @xmath5 , but with an effective field    @xmath135    the demagnetizing field produces the feedback mechanism that guarantees the presence of criticality without any tuning of the driving field .",
    "the mechanism is the following : the interface is stuck as long as @xmath5 is such that @xmath136 is below the critical value @xmath90 .",
    "as soon as @xmath137 exceeds the critical value for the depinning transition , the interface starts to move in a series of discontinuous jumps .",
    "the displacement of the interface , however , causes an increase in the magnetization @xmath138 , and therefore in the demagnetizing field , so that at some point the effective field is back below the threshold value , and the avalanche stops .    the work by urbach _",
    "@xcite represents a fundamental step towards the realistic description of an elastic magnetic interface , since the introduction of the demagnetizing field changes dramatically the behavior of the model , from one that shows criticality at the pinning threshold , to one that is critical in a finite range of values of the applied field .",
    "however , the equation used in @xcite to describe the domain wall dynamic still does not take into account all magnetic interactions , namely , it neglects the possible presence of free magnetic dipoles on the wall ( see figure [ freecharges ] ( b ) ) .",
    "indeed , the local curvature of the interface may give rise to discontinuities in the normal component of the magnetization , and generate dipolar forces originating in the bulk of the material .",
    "this complicated interaction has been worked out and included in the model by cizeau , zapperi , durin , and stanley @xcite .",
    "_ considered the effect of dipolar forces originating from free magnetic charges on the wall , and evaluated this bulk effect , showing that it gives rise to a further contribution to the total applied force , acting as a long range elasticity , which works to flatten the interface .",
    "the long range elasticity term turns out to be of the form : @xmath139 with a kernel @xmath140 given by @xmath141 this interaction has been calculated under the mild assumption that the surface charges are not strong enough to deviate the magnetization from the easy axis . the coefficient @xmath142 is given by @xmath143 , where @xmath9 is the vacuum permeability , and @xmath144 is the saturation magnetization per unit volume .",
    "the full equation of motion , including the contributions from surface and bulk dipolar interactions finally results to be : @xmath145 where @xmath146 denotes the average position of the interface and is proportional to the magnetization .    the long range elasticity term is relevant in a renormalization group sense , since it is dominating the surface tension elastic term , as follows by power counting : rescaling @xmath147 and assuming that @xmath148 with some positive @xmath51 , the elastic term from surface tension is rescaled by a factor @xmath149 , while the long range elasticity term from dipolar interactions is rescaled by @xmath150 , where @xmath114 is the dimension of the substrate plane .",
    "this point is treated in a more rigorous way in @xcite where the authors , following the functional renormalization group developed in @xcite , obtain the value @xmath151 for the upper critical dimension .",
    "the lowering of the upper critical dimension of the system from @xmath152 ( which is the one characterizing a generic elastic interface in a random media i.e. without the long range kernel ) to @xmath153 as a consequence of the presence of the long range dipolar interactions ensures that the mean field approximation holds down to @xmath0 , and ultimately allows to describe most experimental situations in terms of a mean field theory .",
    "corrections to scaling may however be present in @xmath154 : indeed the mean field power law behaviors are usually modified at the upper critical dimension by multiplicative logarithmic factors , as it is for example in the simplest case of the equilibrium ising model in @xmath155 @xcite . as an example closer to the system described by eq .",
    "[ cizeau ] , let us mention that logarithmic corrections at the upper critical dimension for the depinning transition have recently been calculated for the quenched edward wilkinson equation with a driving force ( [ depinning ] ) in @xcite .    equation ( [ cizeau ] ) contains all the energetic contributions involved in the domain wall dynamics . in principle",
    ", one should add an additional noise term to the equation , to account for thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , it has been observed experimentally @xcite that temperature does not affect barkhausen measurements in bulk materials . at this regard",
    "see also @xcite , where a rough estimate of the signal produced by thermal effects is given , which results to be well below the typical instrumental background noise .",
    "this could be different in thin films , where thermal activated motion has been observed .",
    "recent experiments by kim , choe , and shin @xcite report measures by magneto optical imaging on @xmath156 thin films , where the applied field is raised just below the coercive field and then kept constant , so that the observed barkhausen jumps are only triggered by thermal noise ( note that the barkhausen jumps going outside the imaging window makes unreliable the estimates of the critical exponents obtained in @xcite , as already observed in @xcite ) . therefore , in the case of thin films , an extra time dependent random term may be required in the equation of motion to include thermal noise .    the elastic interface model described by equation ( [ cizeau ] ) has been extensively studied by numerical simulations , by direct integration and by simulating an automaton version of the model , and both in finite dimensions and in the mean field limit .",
    "simulations in the infinite range limit confirm the equivalence with the abbm model ( see below ) , by reproducing the same amplitude distribution , and pulses statistics .",
    "the simulations of the interface model in @xmath0 , recover the mean field results , in agreement with @xmath157 being the upper critical dimension .",
    "however , the scaling with @xmath55 of the cut  off in the distributions of pulses sizes and durations does not agree with the predictions of the mean field .",
    "this point will be discussed more in detail in subsection [ sec : cutoff ] .",
    "although in this review we are dealing only with soft magnetic materials in the long range universality class , it is worth to note that the model by cizeau _",
    "@xcite has a more general validity .",
    "the results discussed above change when the long range kernel in equation ( [ cizeau ] ) is absent , and the surface term is the dominating term . in this case the model is equivalent to the one previously proposed in @xcite .",

    "@xcite has been worked out by the same authors in @xcite , where they show that in the mean field approximation , their interface model coincides with the phenomenological abbm model .",
    "this fact might indeed explain why the abbm model describes the experiments so accurately .",
    "mean field theory is derived by taking the limit of long range interactions in the equation of motion .",
    "this is done by coupling all the points on the interface uniformly with the average wall position .",

    "the effective noise @xmath169 is then given by @xmath170    to calculate the correlations , note that , in the difference @xmath171 , the only terms that contribute to the sum are those relative to the pinning points that have actually moved , whose number is proportional to the average wall displacement @xmath172 , so that , @xmath173 being random and uncorrelated , the effective noise is a brownian noise in @xmath168 : @xmath174    this finally explains the nature of the effective brownian correlated pinning field , which was observed experimentally in @xcite , and used as an assumption in @xcite to derive the abbm equation .",
    "the long range correlations observed in the pinning field are not a result of real long range correlations between defects in the material .",
    "rather , the effective correlated pinning field experienced by the center of mass of the wall originates as a collective effect from the interactions along the elastic wall moving in an uncorrelated disordered medium .",
    "the average wall position is proportional to the magnetization , so that equation [ mf1 ] can be rewritten as @xmath175 which coincides with the abbm equation ( [ abbm ] ) .",
    "the abbm model is extremely successful in describing bn experiments , although it was proposed on phenomenological basis , without a clear reference to the underlying physics .",
    "the fact that the abbm model can be derived as a mean field theory of an interface model obtained by taking into account all the relevant magnetic interactions is therefore very important .",
    "we want to stress that the relation with the elastic interface model not only validates the abbm model , by giving to it a more grounded microscopical derivation , but also allows to relate the model parameters to microstructural properties of the material , making possible a close quantitative comparison between theory and experiments .",
    "the abbm approach allows to write a simple equation of motion for the center of mass of the magnetic wall separating two regions of opposite magnetization .",
    "interestingly , the statistical properties of this dynamics can be fully worked out analytically .    the easiest way to do",
    "this is to transform the equation by eliminating the correlated noise .",

    "the effect of the driving field rate on crackling events has been recently studied by white and dahmen in @xcite . in this work",
    "the authors make a distinction between an avalanche ( sequence of events triggered by an initial event at constant driving field ) , and a pulse ( uninterrupted sequence of events measured in experiments ) . in general , at non  zero sweep rate a pulse can be a superposition of several simultaneously propagating avalanches , while avalanches and pulses coincide only in the adiabatic limit . under some general assumptions that are fulfilled by many crackling systems , the authors of @xcite show by scaling arguments that the value of the exponent @xmath51 in the distribution of events durations determines whether or not the pulse statistic will be affected by the sweep rate @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , they claim that no dependence on @xmath30 has to be expected for @xmath299 , while a linear dependence of the kind @xmath53 is predicted in the case @xmath278 .",
    "it would be very interesting to make a connection between the results obtained in @xcite in terms of superposition of adiabatic avalanches with those reported here for the abbm model , but this has not been done yet .",
    "another evidence in barkhausen noise phenomenology is the fact that the intermittent behavior typical of the avalanche dynamics is lost when the driving field is cycled too fast : above a threshold value of the driving field rate the typical intermittent signal disappears , and the magnetization reversal proceeds in a unique avalanche .",
    "the existence of a threshold value in the driving field rate @xmath30 , corresponds to the existence of a special value @xmath30 for the coefficient of the logarithmic potential , that discriminates among two qualitatively different behaviors .",
    "the value @xmath239 already appeared in equation ( [ current_0 ] ) as the threshold below which the probability current at the origin is negative .",
    "essentially , this value of @xmath30 determines whether or not the random walk is recurrent .",
    "the random walk is certainly recurrent for @xmath300 , which corresponds to an attractive potential at the origin .",
    "this , however , does not correspond to the physical case of bn .",
    "the case of physical interest is @xmath301 , corresponding to a repulsive potential .",
    "interestingly , the random walk may come back to the origin even when it is subject to a logarithmic repulsion , as long as the repulsive potential coefficient is not too strong .",
    "this gives a condition on the coefficient @xmath30 .    a a simple and clear way to interpret",
    "this behavior is to observe that there exists a natural mapping between the free random walk in @xmath27 dimension and the confined one dimensional random walk in a logarithmic potential .",
    "starting from the fokker ",
    "planck equation for a free random walk in @xmath27 dimensions .",
    "@xmath302 we can write the fokker ",
    "planck equation for the radial part in polar coordinates as follows @xmath303 this equation shows that the radial part of free random walk in @xmath27 dimensions performs a one dimensional random walk in a logarithmic potential confined to a semiplane , with coefficient @xmath30 equal to @xmath114 for the potential .    using this mapping ,",
    "the existence of a threshold value in the coefficient of the potential is explained in terms of the well known recurrence properties of the free random walk .",
    "the condition @xmath304 for the random walk to be recurrent translates into @xmath229 .",
    "let us now analyze the effect of to the bias term @xmath55 .",
    "we consider a simple biased random walk first : @xmath305    = 5.5 cm    by rescaling @xmath306 , it is clear that the probability for a biased random walk with constant bias @xmath55 to return to the origin is equivalent to the probability for a free random walk to return onto the line @xmath307 . given that the random walk is sub  linear , this introduces a characteristic timescale @xmath52 , after which the random walk will very unlikely , namely with exponentially small probability , go back to the line @xmath307 ( see figure [ s_bias ] ) .",
    "the value of the characteristic time @xmath52 is such that @xmath308 , which gives @xmath309 .",
    "since @xmath61 corresponds to magnetization in the physical variables , @xmath52 corresponds to the characteristic avalanche size @xmath36 in the cut  off of equation ( [ size_distrib ] ) . as we will see further on , @xmath310 , giving @xmath311 for the cut  off in equation ( [ time_distrib ] ) .",
    "as we have seen in subsection [ sec : mar ] , the logarithmic potential term does not alter the dynamic exponent @xmath116 which is still equal to @xmath312 as for the free random walk , thus the walk in the logarithmic potential is still sublinear , and is affected by the bias in the same way as the free random walk .    the fact that the bias term @xmath55 generates an exponential cut  off in the distribution of the return times , physically means that the size of the largest magnetization event is regulated by the demagnetizing field .",
    "in analogy to conventional critical phenomena one might expect that pulses of different durations have an average shape that , once properly rescaled , collapses onto a universal scaling function . in a recent paper by sethna _",
    "_ @xcite it was suggested that this scaling function is an interesting quantity to measure in order to make quantitative comparison between the theoretical models and experiments .",
    "this quantity provides a much sharper tool to test theory against experiments than the simple comparison of critical exponents , that are scalar quantities .",
    "indeed , by performing this kind of analysis on experimental data , average pulses , properly rescaled by their durations , approximately collapse onto the same function ( see figure [ shape ] ) @xcite .",
    "the average shape of the pulse is related , in terms of the corresponding stochastic process , to what is known in the mathematical literature as the _ excursion _ , namely the average trajectory between two successive return of the process to some reference value .    the average shape for the process ( [ rw - log ] ) has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "this work was exactly motivated by the problem , raised in @xcite , of finding the average form of a barkhausen pulse as a function of time .",
    "let us consider a generic random walk in a potential @xmath191 : @xmath313    the average over trajectories starting at @xmath201 at time @xmath255 , and constrained to come back to @xmath201 for the first time at @xmath314 , that we will denote as @xmath315 is found to scale , in appropriate time regimes depending on the potential @xmath316 , as @xmath317 where @xmath318 is some scaling function @xcite .",
    "let us consider processes constrained to the semiplane @xmath319 , and focus on the returns to the origin ( take as reference value a small threshold @xmath320 ) .",
    "once the solution with absorbing boundary conditions of the fokker planck equation corresponding to the langevin equation ( [ sto_proc ] ) is known , the excursion can be expressed by averaging over all trajectories going through @xmath190 at time @xmath61 .    in general ,",
    "the probability for a markovian process starting at @xmath205 at time @xmath258 and going back to @xmath205 at time @xmath37 to be found at position @xmath190 at time @xmath61 , is given by @xmath321 .",
    "using time translational invariance @xmath322 , where @xmath323 is the conditional probability for the inverse process .",
    "the average excursion is therefore obtained by taking the following limit for @xmath324 : @xmath325 which counts the fraction of excursions that go through @xmath190 at time @xmath61 .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the excursion for the simplest case of a free random walk @xcite .",
    "the probability @xmath326 for the walk confined to the semiplane can be calculated by the image method as a linear combination of two solutions of the fokker planck for the free process : @xmath327 which for small @xmath205 gives @xmath328 in this case @xmath329 due to the process time reversal invariance , therefore the average excursion is given by @xmath330 with @xmath331 .",
    "evaluating the integrals gives @xmath332    therefore the exponent @xmath333 is equal to the wandering exponent of the free process @xmath334 , and the scaling function is @xmath335 normalized to have @xmath336 .",

    "this can be calculated in a similar way , by observing that the process is still time translational invariant , and it is invariant under @xmath337 , as long as the coefficient @xmath30 is also inverted in the revers process .",
    "therefore @xmath338 is obtained by replacing @xmath30 with @xmath339 in @xmath340 .    indeed , by repeating the previous steps with the solution of the fokker plank equation ( [ fp ] ) , the calculation finally reduces , also in this case , to evaluating the ratio between two successive moments of a half gaussian with variance @xmath341 , so that the average excursion results to be proportional to @xmath342 , as in the case of the free random walk , and it is still given by equation ( [ f_free ] ) .    to translate this result into the shape of the barkhausen pulse , we have to go back to our original physical variables .",
    "the excursion calculated above corresponds to the signal @xmath22 as a function of the avalanche size @xmath343 .",
    "the average pulse as a function of @xmath343 and of the total size @xmath165 of the pulse is then @xmath344 however , the commonly measured experimental pulses , as those shown in figure [ shape ] , represent the signal @xmath22 as a function of duration @xmath61 of the avalanche , that will have some different scaling and shape @xmath345    following @xcite we calculate the scaling function @xmath346 : we have to express @xmath343 and @xmath165 as functions of @xmath61 , and @xmath37 . by definition , the size @xmath343 of the avalanche at time @xmath61 , is the integral of the signal @xmath22 from time @xmath258 to @xmath61 : @xmath347 therefore , the total size @xmath165 scales as @xmath348 .",

    "these latter results are also supported by the following argument .",
    "the maximum interface jump is limited by a correlation length @xmath392 , which is the length at which the dipolar interaction term , of order @xmath393 overcome the restoring force . in @xmath0 ( where the interface is not rough ) , this is of order @xmath394 , where @xmath395 is the size of the avalanche .",
    "this gives @xmath396 , and therefore @xmath397 .",
    "in the same papers @xcite , results from more recent experiments are also reported , corresponding to @xmath398 , and @xmath399 , that could be compatible with the values @xmath390 , and @xmath400 . in these works ,",
    "the experimental estimates of the dependence on the demagnetizing field is extracted by repeating experiments on the same sample , which is progressively cut in order to change the value of @xmath55 .",
    "this procedure allows to change the value of @xmath55 while stress and internal disorder are kept constant in the repeated experiments ( see figure [ so_to ] , which also reports the results of experiments on materials belonging to the short range universality class not discussed here ) . the experimental results in @xcite are therefore expected to be more reliable than previous ones , where different samples where used as in @xcite .",
    "the scaling with @xmath55 of the cut  offs in the distributions of sizes and durations of the avalanches seems to agree with that predicted by the elastic interface model at the upper critical dimension @xmath0 , although this prediction is different from the mean field one .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy between mean field behavior and the behavior at the upper critical dimension is not fully understood , and we believe that this point would still need further analysis in order to be definitely clarified .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , despite its extreme simplicity , the abbm model is able to capture a number of phenomenological evidences from bn experiments .",
    "however , the analysis on the scaling functions is more subtle : although the average pulses do approximately collapse onto each other once rescaled by their duration , by comparing the average shape of rescaled experimental barkhausen pulses with the prediction from the abbm model , one clearly observes a discrepancy : while the abbm model predicts a symmetric shape , experimental pulses are systematically characterized by a visible leftward asymmetry , as can be seen in figure [ asymm_abbm ] .",
    "the leftward asymmetry indicates that , unlike what would be expected from standard inertia , avalanches start fast and end slowly .    given the success of abbm theory in reproducing many other aspects of phenomenology , this inconsistency has been considered quite enigmatic , and the issue of understanding its origin has remained an open problem for some time .",
    "the first attempts to identify the origin of the asymmetry have been done in @xcite , and more extensively in @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the authors pose the general problem of analyzing the behavior of the average excursion in a stochastic process , in order to understand to which extent this quantity is universal , and what kind of information it gives on the process .",
    "the idea was that this analysis could suggest in which direction the abbm equation had to be modified in order to recover a leftward asymmetric pulse shape .    for a large class of stochastic processes ,",
    "a scaling law of the form [ exc1 ] is obeyed , in an appropriate time regime , with a scaling function that is , to a large extent , independent of the details of the single increment distribution , while it encodes interesting information on the presence and form of correlations .",
    "indeed the introduction of correlated noise , is found to induce asymmetric shapes .",
    "however , in the cases considered in @xcite , the scaling functions are characterized by a negative skewness , corresponding to a rightward asymmetric shape .",
    "more recently @xcite , the origin of the asymmetry has finally been identified as a transient effect of eddy currents .",
    "eddy currents are generated in conducting magnets as a response to domain wall displacements .",
    "this response , however , is not instantaneous and acts as an anti  inertial effect on the domain wall dynamics .",
    "it turns out that the effect of this retardation can indeed be accounted for , to a first approximation , by including a negative effective inertial term in the stochastic equation of motion for the domain wall .",
    "figure [ shape ] shows an attempt to collapse average pulses of different durations , obtained from a bn experiment on a polycrystalline @xmath1 sample , onto the same function .",
    "the pulses do approximately collapse , when properly rescaled , however , the supposedly universal shape is clearly not symmetric , as would be predicted by the abbm model ( see figure [ asymm_abbm ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry appears to be more pronounced for small avalanches .    to get a quantitative measure of the asymmetry",
    "the skewness can be calculated as : @xmath401 where @xmath402 .",
    "figure [ ex_skewness ] shows the skewness as a function of the pulse duration in an experiment on a partially crystallized @xmath403 ribbon .",
    "the skewness is always positive , corresponding to the leftward asymmetry .",
    "it shows a peak for @xmath404 , and decays to zero as @xmath37 goes to infinity .",
    "the fact that , except for the initial increase at very small durations , the asymmetry becomes smaller and smaller for larger and larger avalanches suggests that the ingredient still missing in the abbm theory must involve microscopic details of the system that become negligible on larger scales .",
    "the presence of a peak indicates the existence of some microscopic timescale .      to understand why abbm is unable to reproduce the leftward asymmetry of the average pulse shape",
    ", we have to go back and question the assumptions which were made in its derivation .",
    "the equation of motion for the magnetic interface was derived by assuming that the work done by the total effective field ( the applied field corrected by the demagnetizing and pinning fields ) balances at any time the energy dissipated by eddy currents , which , in the quasistatic approximation , is proportional to the instantaneous velocity .",
    "the equation is overdamped , and neglects inertial effects .",
    "let us mention that the existence of inertial effects in domain wall dynamics , has been demonstrated by dering @xcite , who showed that a moving wall differed in energy from the wall at rest by a term due to gyromagnetic effects and proportional to the square wall speed .",
    "he identified this as a kinetic energy term and defined the constant of proportionality as one  half of the mass of the wall .",
    "the so called dering mass @xmath405 results to be proportional to the inverse wall width divided by the squared gyromagnetic ratio ( for a simplified treatment see @xcite , and also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "inertial effects are therefore always present in domain wall dynamics , however , they are not relevant up to the ghz band , and can be safely neglected in the equation of motion for the magnetic wall in other regimes , where eddy currents damping largely overwhelms the contribution from dering mass .",
    "the assumption that the work done by the net field is at any time proportional to the instantaneous velocity is , however , only approximately correct : eddy currents take a finite time to set up after the corresponding wall displacement , and also , they persist for a finite time after the magnetic reversal . because of this delay , the eddy pressure on the wall at a given time @xmath61 of the avalanche depends on the history of the motion : is not strictly proportional to the instantaneous velocity , but rather it is a weighted average of all the velocities from the beginning of the avalanche up to time @xmath61 .",
    "to go beyond the quasistatic approximation , one has to investigate the dynamical effects eddy current dissipation . following the lines indicated by @xcite",
    "this has been done by calculating the magnetic field generated by the eddy currents from the full maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "consider a sample with dimension @xmath406 $ ] , @xmath407 $ ] , and infinite in the @xmath116 direction , divided in two magnetic domains by a rigid domain wall on the @xmath408 plane , that starts to move from the zero  magnetization position @xmath201 , as in figure [ eddy.eps ] .",
    "the displacement of the magnetic wall in the conducting medium induces a flow of eddy currents that generates a magnetic field @xmath409 , which , in this geometry , is parallel to the @xmath116 axis : @xmath410 neglecting the displacement currents with respect to the ohmic currents , the maxwell equation for @xmath409 is @xmath411 where @xmath412 and @xmath15 are the electric conductivity and the magnetic permeability of the medium respectively .",
    "equation ( [ maxwell ] ) is a diffusion equation for the eddy field , with a typical timescale for diffusion proportional to @xmath413 . in the quasi ",

    "this approximation is correct as long as there is a clear separation of timescales , which happens when the observed quantities do not vary appreciably in time on a scale of the order of the characteristic time for diffusion . in that case",
    ", one can assume an instantaneous response of the eddy field as given by the static maxwell equation .",
    "however , this is not the case for barkhausen avalanches , especially for short ones , and therefore the dynamic effect of eddy field has to be taken into account .",
    "let us go back to equation ( [ maxwell ] ) , which has to be solved subject to the appropriate boundary condition    @xmath415    on the sample surface , and with the faraday condition @xmath416 that regulates the discontinuity of the field across the wall . in equation [ faraday",

    "@xmath464 is of the order of @xmath465 .",
    "although this time is small with respect to overall duration of a barkhausen pulse , the magnetization within an avalanche does vary appreciably on that timescale ( see figure [ shape ] ) .      in terms of the equation of motion ,",
    "the effect due to the non  instantaneous response of the eddy field to the wall displacement is accounted for by replacing the left hand side of equation ( [ mf2 ] ) with the retarded pressure @xmath466 .",
    "this leads to a modified abbm equation : @xmath467 that includes the time nonlocal effects .",
    "the eddy dissipation keeps memory of the past velocities of the interface , within a timescale of the order of the eddy field diffusion relaxation time .    to clarify the effects of the response function ,",
    "it is useful to consider the case of a simple exponential decay @xmath468 , which corresponds to the contribution of a single term in equation ( [ f ] ) to the equation of motion .",
    "as long as @xmath469 is small with respect of the duration of the avalanches considered , only velocities at small times before @xmath61 will contribute to the convolution , so that we can expand @xmath470 around @xmath61 and perform the integrals : @xmath471 a simple exponential response function would therefore modify the equation of motion by introducing an inertial term @xmath472 and would lead to the identification of an effective mass @xmath473 , which turns out to be negative .",
    "when the full response function is considered , a series of mass and damping terms are generated , each coming from a single exponential .",
    "taking only the leading order in @xmath15 , this procedure leads in a similar way to the identification of a damping coefficient @xmath474 and of a negative effective mass @xmath475 where @xmath476 , and @xmath477 , and @xmath455 indicates a summation over odd numbers only .    as in the case of the simple exponential relaxation ,",
    "the ratio between mass and damping defines a characteristic time @xmath478    keeping all orders in @xmath15 results in a frequency dependent effective mass , that has been calculated in @xcite and is given by @xmath479 the effective mass turns out to be negative at all frequencies .",
    "the leftward pulse asymmetry observed in barkhausen experiments is indeed consistent with a negative effective mass : the avalanches start fast and end slowly , which is exactly the opposite of what one would expect from standard inertia .",
    "indeed , since the retarded pressure at time @xmath61 is given by a weighted average of previous velocities of the wall up to time @xmath61 , this anti ",
    "inertial effect can be understood by observing that the effective average velocity is smaller than the instantaneous one for an accelerating wall , while the opposite is true when the wall decelerates .",
    "the role of sample geometry on eddy current retardation has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "it turns out that the only geometrical parameter that significantly affects the damping coefficient , effective mass , and characteristic time , is the smallest sample dimension .",
    "= 9.5 cm    figure [ a3 ] shows the variation of damping coefficient @xmath109 , characteristic time @xmath52 , and of the modulus of the effective mass @xmath12 , as a function of the aspect ratio @xmath480 defined as @xmath481 and keeping constant the section area @xmath482 .",
    "these three quantities have a maximum in the case of a square rod .",
    "therefore this is the geometry where , @xmath11 being constant , the maximum asymmetry is expected to be observed .",
    "figure [ b3 ] shows the variation of the the same three quantities as a function of the most relevant parameter , which is the smallest sample dimension @xmath483 .",
    "the damping coefficient @xmath109 , characteristic time @xmath52 , and modulus of the effective mass @xmath12 , increase as @xmath27 , @xmath484 , and @xmath485 respectively , and saturate to the values @xmath486 , @xmath11 , and @xmath487 , respectively .",
    "the role of the two dimensions @xmath211 , and @xmath488 , transverse and parallel to the wall is however not symmetric , and the effect of eddy current retardation is expected to be more severe , other things being equal , when the transverse dimension is the smallest .",
    "the analytical expressions of @xmath109 , @xmath52 , and @xmath12 used in figures [ a3 ] , and [ b3 ] are given in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat bn experiments in changing sample geometries in order to test these results .",
    "let us comment on the relevance of the eddy inertial term when compared to the usual inertial term which is associated to the dring mass @xmath405 .",
    "the values of @xmath405 are about four orders of magnitude smaller then the eddy mass @xmath12 in typical sample geometries used in bn experiments .",
    "indeed the dring mass originates from a gyroscopic precessional effect , whose associated time scales are much faster then those relative to the eddy mass",
    ". however , the analysis reported in @xcite on the dependence on sample geometry predicts a fast decay @xmath489 of the mass with the sample thickness , which means that the two masses may become comparable in thick films .      by simulating numerically the modified abbm equation ( [ modified_abbm ] ) one observes that , whereas the distributions of avalanche duration and size are unaffected by the addition of the inertial term , the pulse shapes become asymmetric and bear a remarkable similarity with the experimental ones ( see figures [ nphys1 ] , [ nphys2 ] , where the curves are normalized with @xmath490 ) @xcite .",
    "note that eddy currents only change the internal dynamics of the avalanches , so that at least the distribution of avalanches sizes is expected to be left unaltered , while correction could be present in the power spectrum ( see below ) and in the distribution of avalanche durations ( not observed ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    the skewness of the simulated model results positive , indicating a leftward asymmetry , corresponding to a negative mass , while it would be negative , indicating rightward asymmetry , in the standard case of a positive mass .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the skewness as a function of the avalanche duration in correspondence to a negative mass ( see figure [ skewness.eps ] ) is similar to the one observed in the experiments ( see figure [ ex_skewness ] ) : it is always positive , it increases from zero , shows a peak at some characteristic time , and it decays to zero for long avalanches .",
    "the existence of a peak can be used to extract the characteristic relaxation timescale , which corresponds to the ratio between mass and damping constant , and to make a quantitative comparison between the model and experiments .",
    "a further quantitative test of the theory against experiments includes the comparison of the location of the peak @xmath491 that characterizes the skewness versus duration plot .",
    "skewness extracted from experimental pulses shows a @xmath492 at a value which is roughly twice that obtained from simulations of the modified abbm equation with the microscopic parameters of the corresponding experiment .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the model considers just one single domain wall , while many domains may be present in general in a sample .",
    "it is indeed expected @xcite that the relaxation time increases with the number of domains .",
    "another interesting point to underline is the effect of the negative inertial term on the power spectra .",
    "power spectra obtained by simulating the modified abbm equation show a deviation from the large frequency asymptotic regime at a frequency @xmath493 very similar to the one observed in some experiments .",
    "moreover , experimental data also show a correspondence between the peak in the skewness and the frequency at which the deviation appears in the spectrum @xcite .    summarizing the discussion of this section",
    ", we can conclude that the leftward asymmetry of pulse profiles in bn is caused by the non instantaneous response of the eddy field to the wall displacement , that can be accounted for by associating a negative effective mass to the moving wall .",
    "the asymmetry is a non ",
    "universal property , that depends on the material parameters @xmath412 , @xmath15 , and @xmath25 and on the geometrical dimensions @xmath211 and @xmath488 of the sample , and therefore it allows to extract information about the characteristic time ruling the microscopic dynamics .    since the asymmetry is related to the existence of this microscopic timescale , its magnitude depends on the avalanche duration : for avalanches long enough with respect to the characteristic time , the microscopic details of the material and the geometry of the sample become irrelevant , pulse  shapes become symmetric , and universality",
    "is expected to hold .",
    "let us finally comment on the physical meaning of the eddy inertial term .",
    "it has always to be kept in mind that the negative effective mass is just a convenient way to account , to the first order , for the history dependent damping .",
    "the effective mass , however , is unable to describe for example the very short time dynamics , when the domain wall starts to move from its position at rest . indeed , in this case , the negative mass would cause the wall to move backward , which is certainly not the case . here the results of this section should be used with more care : when the wall starts to move there is no previous motion history , and therefore both the eddy damping and the eddy inertial term are zero . in the very short time dynamics the dring mass , which is positive , represents the most relevant inertial term in the equation of motion .",
    "therefore standard inertia governs the dynamics , until damping and eddy mass build up .",
    "crackling noise emerges in very different contexts , and the similarity in how completely different systems behave suggests the existence of some common principle in the underlying physics . as an example of how ideas developed in the study of one crackling system can stimulate advances in other fields ,",
    "we report here some analogies between bn and two other crackling system : sheared granular materials and seismic activity in earthquakes .",
    "a granular medium , subject to a slow loading rate , has an intermittent shear response characterized by large fluctuations , typical of crackling systems @xcite . the large fluctuations in this case",
    "originate from the rearrangement of the network of force chains along which the stress propagate .",
    "most of the past theoretical activity on granular matter has focused on average properties , that could allow the formulation of macroscopic laws governing the dynamics .",
    "however , more recently it became clear that a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics on smaller scales and cause the large fluctuations , can not be reached without going through a detailed analysis of the slip statistics .    in this framework ,",
    "a very interesting model has recently been proposed to interpret a series of experiments on granular materials sheared in a couette geometry @xcite . this model , is based on an assumption similar to the one that underlies the abbm model for bn , namely that the resultant from the forces acting on the system performs a brownian motion .    in the experiment a cylindrical cell",
    "is filled with monodisperse glass beads with @xmath494 of diameter .",
    "the shear is created by rotating an annular plate over the top of the circular channel , driven by a torsion spring with stiffness @xmath55 . after being initialized to reach the stationary state ,",
    "the system is then run at a slow driving velocity @xmath22 .",
    "the experimental device allows to measure the angular position @xmath495 of the plate , and the deflection of the torsion spring . in a given range of driving velocities",
    ", the system displays a stick  slip regime , where repeatedly the torque on the plate accumulates as the spring winds up , until the plate slips .",
    "the instantaneous velocity of the plate @xmath496 as a function of time , shows the typical intermittent behavior of crackling signals , with pulses of largely fluctuating amplitudes .",
    "a statistical analysis of the signal similar to the one usually done for bn emissions reveals the presence of power law distributions of the slip events in the stick  slip phase , as it was already observed in a previous experiment @xcite .",
    "in this case the pulse size @xmath343 corresponds to the angular variation during the slip event .",
    "the sizes and durations distributions show a more complex shape than in the bn case , since the initial power law decay is followed by a peak at larger scales , in correspondence to some cut  off value .",
    "the position of the peak is independent of the driving velocity @xmath22 .",
    "as in the case of bn , the intermittent stick  slip phase is observed only as long as the driving velocity is not too large . above a threshold value ,",
    "a transition to a steady sliding regime occurs , that is analogous to the transition between the intermittent bn noise regime , and the unique avalanche magnetization reversal that occurs at high sweep field rates .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors propose a simple model that quantitatively reproduces the phenomenology , and which is based on some minimal hypothesis .",
    "the equation of motion for the stick  slipping plate is obtained by equating the inertial term to the driving force on the spring diminished by the counteracting friction of the granular media .",
    "@xmath497 here @xmath498 is the moment of inertia of the system , and the whole complexity of the granular matter dynamics that give rise to the wide fluctuations is accounted for in the frictional torque term @xmath442 .",
    "baldassarri _ et al .",
    "_ assume that , as a first approximation , the instantaneous frictional torque is a function of @xmath495 and @xmath496 only ( since @xmath442 is constant when the disk is stuck , there is no direct dependence on time @xmath61 in @xmath442 ) , and that @xmath442 can be split into a deterministic part @xmath499 plus a random contribution @xmath500 .",
    "the deterministic part of the instantaneous friction @xmath499 is obtained by fitting the experimental average velocity dependence of the frictional torque with the expression @xmath501 where @xmath502 is the average static friction force , @xmath503 is the minimum average torque and @xmath333 is the high velocity damping .",
    "note , that the results obtained , however , do not depend very much on the precise choice of the function @xmath504 .",
    "the fluctuating part of the instantaneous friction is the one that accounts for the continuously rearranging disordered structure of the force chain network present in the granular medium .",
    "this is assumed to be described by a confined brownian process @xmath505 where @xmath173 is a gaussian quenched uncorrelated noise , and @xmath211 is an inverse correlation length .",
    "the idea is that the frictional torque changes of a random amount after every small slip , but eventually decorrelate on large slips involving a complete rearrangement of the grains , resulting in a confinement of the brownian process .",
    "the quantity @xmath506 plays the same role as the correlation length of the pinning field @xmath373 introduced in the abbm model ( see section [ sec : ps2 ] ) .",
    "this theory shows a number of analogies with the abbm theory for bn .",
    "the granular matter dynamics is more complicated than the one of magnetic domains , due to the presence of inertial effects and of a shear rate weakening torque .",
    "however , both theories are based on the same assumption that the effective force acting on the system performs a brownian motion .",
    "indeed , the presence of brownian correlations in the effective force evolution , due to collective effects ( the sum over many pinning forces over the domain wall in one case , the formation and destruction of force chains in the granular media in the other ) may be of more general validity in driven dissipative systems .    the equation of motion is also similar in the two cases , and , although , the one describing the granular material includes more complex effects , it reduces to the abbm equation in the limit @xmath507 of vanishing inertia and minimal average torque . in this case , or in an appropriate velocity regime @xmath508 , where the additional effects can be neglected ,",
    "all the results obtained for the abbm model are valid , once magnetization is interpreted as a slip , the magnetic field rate as a shear rate , the demagnetizing factor as the stiffness of the torsional spring , the eddy current damping as a frictional damping , and the random pinning as a random friction .",
    "the analogy also suggests that the transition from the stick  slip phase at slow drivings to the sliding phase at fast drivings might possibly be explained also in this case as a transition from transient to recurrent for the corresponding stochastic process .",
    "another kind of crackling noise that shows analogies with bn is the seismic activity during earthquakes .",
    "earthquake phenomenology exhibits a number of power law distributions including the gutenberg - richter frequency - size statistics @xcite and the omori law for aftershock decay rates @xcite .    in literature",
    ", the area of the region of the fault that slips in an earthquake is called the _ moment_.",
    "the probability of occurrence of an earthquake of a given moment @xmath12 decays as a power law according to @xmath509 the exponent @xmath510 is the same , within errors , for most sets of data , collected in different times and regions .    as in the case of bn",
    ", scaling functions have been introduced as additional interesting observables , which provides a powerful tool both to check universality , and to test the theory against data . in particular , the average moment rate profiles at fixed total earthquake duration , have been studied in @xcite , and compared with the prediction of a mean field theory for earthquakes dynamics @xcite .    the average moment rate is supposed to behave as @xmath511    in paper @xcite the universal function @xmath512 is claimed to be : @xmath513 this result was obtained by mapping the model onto the mean field model for bn , for which the result of @xmath346 being an inverted parabola was claimed in @xcite .",
    "it is clear from figure [ earthq ] that in seismic data the moment rate of a given duration @xmath37 increases faster then it drops , as the corresponding average moment shapes show a leftward asymmetry similar to that observed in bn , while , also in this case , models predict a symmetric shape .",
    "seismic movements are caused by the motion of fault planes in response to the accumulated stress .",
    "the analogy with bn suggests the possibility that the origin of the asymmetry is similar in the two cases . the asymmetry may indeed originate from some non  local dynamical effect , that , in the case of earthquakes could be caused by the presence of stress overshoots @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see how the skewness of the average pulses changes with the duration of the seismic event ( which is not clear for the data in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as this can help to understand whether or not also in this case the asymmetry disappears in large events , and whether universality is recovered oon large time scales .    in the case of earthquakes ,",
    "the analogy with domain wall dynamics is even more stringent than in the case of sheared granular media . indeed , the mean field description studied in @xcite exactly coincides with the abbm model .",
    "long range elastic interactions lead to @xmath0 being the upper critical dimension for earthquakes models @xcite , and playing the same role as the long range dipolar interactions in bn .",
    "it is interesting to mention that asymmetric avalanches are also observed in other crackling systems .",
    "the dynamics of the bak  tang  wiesenfeld model of sand piles @xcite is characterized by asymmetric avalanches @xcite .",
    "leftward asymmetric pulses also appear in the intermittent behavior of systems undergoing a shear deformation that proceeds in bursts of dislocations activity @xcite .",
    "recently laurson and alava @xcite analyzed a discrete dislocation dynamics model and observed , in agreement with the experiments , a leftward asymmetry in the avalanche shape , corresponding to an asymmetry in the average creation and annihilation rates of dislocations during the avalanche .",
    "they also find that the asymmetry decreases with the signal threshold , although the threshold value do not have visible effects on the avalanche statistics .",
    "finally , a strong skewness in the avalanche shape has recently been observed in the acustic emissions during martensitic transformations @xcite .",
    "in this review we report on the present state of understanding of the barkhausen effect in soft ferromagnetic materials , focusing on those with long range dipolar interactions .",
    "in particular , we collect several results on the mean field abbm model for bn .",
    "this model , originally proposed on phenomenological basis , corresponds to a mean field description for an elastic magnetic wall in a disordered ferromagnet under the effect of an external driving field , and is extremely successful in reproducing the complex phenomenology observed in the experiments , at least as long as universal properties are involved .",
    "the abbm model consists of an effective equation of motion for the velocity of the avalanche front .",
    "this equation maps onto the langevin equation for a biased random walk in a logarithmic potential with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "this process is amenable to analytical treatment with standard methods in the theory of stochastic processes .",
    "therefore this mapping has the advantage to provide several exact results , as well as a direct interpretation of a number of properties observed in the experiments in terms of properties of the corresponding stochastic process .",
    "specifically , through this mapping , the power laws in the distributions of sizes and durations of avalanches are exactly derived in terms of distributions of return times to the origin , the continuous dependence of the exponents in the power law distributions on the driving field rate can be calculated and turns out to be related to the marginality of the logarithmic perturbation to a free random walk , the existence of a threshold in the driving field rate has a clear interpretation ( thanks to a further mapping ) in terms of recurrence properties of a free random walk , the existence of a cut  off in the power law distributions is ascribed to the bias term , and therefore is due to the presence of the demagnetizing field , and finally the average shape of the barkhausen pulse which is related to the excursion of the process , and the power spectra of the noise can be computed explicitly .",
    "although deviations from the abbm predictions are observed in some experiments , the picture that emerges from this theory is quite satisfactory .",
    "the most relevant experimental feature that is not reproduced by abbm is the leftward asymmetric shape systematically observed in experiments .",
    "this asymmetry is due to a non  local damping by the eddy currents , whose effect is neglected in the original abbm model formulation , as it is in most domain walls models .",
    "this effect can be taken into account by including in the equation of motion an inertial term with a negative effective mass for the interface , which leads to the definition of a generalized abbm model .",
    "the asymmetry of the pulses depend on the duration and can be used to extract important information on the characteristic time of the underlying dynamics .    a basic point to keep in mind ,",
    "is that the whole theory developed so far models one single domain wall , while many interacting domain walls are in general involved in the magnetization process .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to understand how the presence of many domains modifies the present theory .",
    "although the abbm theory was derived as a model for barkhausen noise , it turns out to be a paradigmatic theory for avalanche dynamics , and can give suggestions on how to model other crackling systems .",
    "we discussed some analogies with sheared granular matter and seismic events .",
    "these similarities point to the existence of deep connections between the physics of avalanches in different systems .",
    "also the presence of non  universal effects might be common to other crackling system .",
    "asymmetric avalanche shapes similar to those observed in bn appear in other crackling systems : in martensitic transformations , in plastic deformations , in the bak - tang - wiesenfeld model of sand piles , and in seismic events . in the last case , the leftward asymmetric average moments may originate , from the presence of stress overshoots .",

    "<S> these effects can be incorporated in the model , and result , to a first order approximation , in a negative effective mass associated with the wall . </S>",
    "<S> the progress made in understanding bn is potentially relevant for other crackling systems : on one hand , the abbm model turns out to be a paradigmatic model for the universal behavior of avalanches dynamics ; on the other hand , the microscopic explanation of the asymmetry in the noise pulses suggests that inertial effects may also be at the origin of pulses asymmetry observed in other crackling systems . </S>"
