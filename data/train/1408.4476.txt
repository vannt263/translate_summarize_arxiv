    "<S> 4b indicates a significant role of electron overheating @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath160 , @xmath127 and @xmath126 are not only controlled by the scattering and recombination of quasiparticles @xcite , but also by the smearing of the gap peak in @xmath36 due to inhomogeneities , inelastic scattering or impurities @xcite , which can make @xmath163 very sample dependent . </S>",
    "<S> interplay of the subgap states and current pairbreaking can bring about competing mechanisms of nonlinearity of @xmath202 , since the subgap states can cause both a finite @xmath126 at @xmath203 @xcite and a residual conductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in any case , the microwave suppression of @xmath204 is more pronounced for sharper gap peaks in @xmath36 at @xmath167 , so that @xmath127 and @xmath126 are not much reduced and the current - induced broadening of @xmath36 takes over at comparatively low fields ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> this conclusion is consistent with the observed variability of the field - induced reduction of @xmath202 @xcite and the tunneling measurements @xcite which revealed fewer subgap states in @xmath36 for the nb resonators exhibiting the significant minimum in @xmath202 shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> a dc field applied parallel to a thin film can be used to tune @xmath7 and separate current pairbreaking from nonequilibrium effects @xcite .    in conclusion , a theory of nonlinear conductivity of dirty superconductors at low temperatures and strong rf electromagnetic field is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the theory explains the effect of the field - induced suppression of surface resistance , in excellent agreement with recent experiments .    </S>",
