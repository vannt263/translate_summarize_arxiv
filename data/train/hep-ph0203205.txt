    "phenomenological analysis of multiparticle production in hadron - hadron collisions in the gev region @xcite revealed interesting substructures , i.e.  soft and semihard events , without and with minijets respectively , each class of events being described by a negative binomial ( pascal ) multiplicity distribution ( nb md ) with different values of the parameters , the average charged multiplicity @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 is here the dispersion .",
    "the weighted composition of the two md s leads to the observed final charged particle md .",
    "clan structure analysis in terms of the average number of clans , @xmath3 , and the average number of particle per clan , @xmath4 , allows to interpret nicely the onset of above mentioned substructures in the gev region .    by extrapolating @xmath0 and @xmath5 behaviour to the tev region , three possible scenarios @xcite for the semihard component have been investigated .",
    "the first one assumes that kno scaling is satisfied both in the soft and semihard component .",
    "this situation should be compared with what is assumed in the other two scenarios for the semihard component where kno scaling is strongly violated or has a qcd inspired behaviour through the c.m .",
    "energy dependence of the corresponding nb md parameters . since",
    ", at the present stage of qcd , calculations of md s and correlations in the gev and tev regions can not be performed in a sound way , we can only rely on qcd inspired extrapolations of the parameters .",
    "the last two scenarios for the semihard component ( the soft component is taken to be the same in all three scenarios ) , although more realistic than the first one , lead to a decreasing average number of clans and to the corresponding increase of the average number of particles per clan as the c.m .  energy increases .",
    "since clans are independently produced by assumption it would be important to understand the real meaning of their decrease for c.m .",
    "energies in the tev region , a fact which seems to widen the motivations at the origin of the first introduction of clan concept in high energy phenomenology @xcite .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that clan structure analysis can be generalised to the huge class of discrete infinitely divisible distributions ( idd ) , to which nb(pascal)md belongs , and therefore any result obtained in the framework of clan structure analysis can be easily extended to the full class of idd s .    in the present paper after a short introduction on the most appealing statistical theories of multiparticle production a new interpretation of @xmath6 charged particles multiplicity distribution , @xmath7 , for the class of idd is proposed in terms of the canonical and grand - canonical partition functions .",
    "then the connection of this new interpretation for the description of the soft and semihard substructures in @xmath8 collisions in terms of the nb ( pascal ) md is examined .",
    "one of the best known statistical approaches to multiparticle dynamics is feynman s fluid analogy @xcite , where the cross - section for the production of @xmath6 particles plays the role of the partition function in the canonical ensemble , as it is an integral over phase - space of the square of a matrix element which plays the role of the gibbs distribution , @xmath9 . in this approach",
    "the volume is identified with the extension of phase space and the fugacity @xmath10 with the dummy variable @xmath11 appearing in the definition of the generating function @xmath12 : @xmath13 this identification is unsatisfactory because one has to satisfy at the same time the definitions of the average number of particles , from the grand - canonical ensemble : @xmath14 and from the definition of generating function : @xmath15 the above formulae can be satisfied at the same time only in the limit of zero chemical potential .",
    "another approach was proposed by scalapino and sugar @xcite : they defined the probability amplitude to produce a particle at rapidity @xmath16 , denoted by @xmath17 , as a random field variable , then introduced a functional @xmath18 $ ] which played a role analogous to the free energy for a system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "one can then obtain the @xmath6-particle inclusive distribution by averaging the product of the squares of the amplitudes , @xmath19 , with a weight given by @xmath20}$ ] .",
    "lacking the knowledge necessary to calculate @xmath18 $ ] from the underlying dynamics , the authors parametrised it ( following ginzburg and landau ) in retaining the first three terms in a series expansion , then solved the model in a few particular cases .",
    "remarkably , to leading order in the size of the allowed full rapidity range , they obtain a generating function which has the form of an idd .",
    "more recent results obtained in the above mentioned frameworks , concerning kno scaling and phase transitions , can be found in @xcite .    stimulated by these results",
    "we propose a new simplified approach to the statistical theory of multiparticle production , heavily based on idd properties and valid for any chemical potential .",
    "we denote with @xmath21 the partition function in the canonical ensemble for a system with a fixed number @xmath6 of particles , volume @xmath22 and temperature @xmath23 , and with @xmath24 the grand - canonical partition function for a system with fugacity @xmath10 , volume @xmath22 and temperature @xmath23 ; the chemical potential @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is boltzmann constant .",
    "we recall the relation between the partition functions : @xmath28 accordingly , in a statistical mechanics framework , the probability @xmath7 of finding @xmath6 particles in the system is the following : @xmath29 noticing that @xmath30 , we find immediately that the grand - canonical partition function is the inverse of the void probability @xmath31 , i.e. , of the probability to find no particles in the system : @xmath32^{-1 }   .",
    "\\label{eq : pzero}\\ ] ] this result is very general : the void probability is the inverse of the grand - canonical partition function and all properties of the system can be obtained from it @xcite .",
    "consider now the wide class of power series distributions ( psd ) , usually defined as follows : @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 free parameters , while proper normalisation requires that @xmath36 notice that @xmath37 can always be chosen to be 1 ( by redefining @xmath38 as @xmath39 ) .",
    "then one has for the void probability : @xmath40    comparing eq.s  ( [ eq : gcprob ] ) to ( [ eq : psd ] ) , our new approach is characterised by the following correspondence : @xmath41    a very interesting property of this novel identification is that @xmath34 is the canonical partition function for a system with a fixed number of particles @xmath6 , and in particular @xmath42 is the canonical partition function for a system with 1 particle .",
    "this means that if we know the multiplicity distribution of a thermodynamical system , and cast it into a psd form , we can not only deduce the grand - partition function but also identify the fugacity of the system and the canonical partition function . as an intriguing example of this correspondence , motivated by the phenomenological analysis of multiparticle production in the gev region",
    ", we will in the next section examine the nb(pascal)md .",
    "any discrete infinitely divisible distribution ( idd ) can be written as a compound poisson distribution ( cpd ) @xcite , i.e. , the number of clans @xmath3 can be defined in such a way that the void probability is : @xmath43 comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eq : pzero ] ) , we notice that for any idd the average number of clans is the logarithm of the grand partition function : @xmath44 all thermodynamical properties can then be obtained by differentiating the average number of clans . in particular , being for the grand canonical ensemble @xmath45 , we obtain the following equation of state : @xmath46 it tells us that our system behaves as an ideal gas of clans , an interpretation which fits very nicely with the idea that clans are independent objects , as implied by the definition of cpds .    the nb(pascal)md , with parameters @xmath0 and @xmath5 : @xmath47 is an example of a psd , with the following identification : @xmath48 furthermore , the nbmd also belongs to the class of discrete idd , the multiplicity distribution inside each clan being of logarithmic type .",
    "we obtain therefore the following value for @xmath3 : @xmath49 which also gives the the grand - canonical partition function , applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : clans ] ) : @xmath50    comparing now with our proposed correspondence , eq .",
    "( [ eq : identify ] ) , we find that @xmath5 is @xmath42 , i.e. , the canonical partition function for a system with 1 particle , and must therefore be function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath51 ; we also find that @xmath35 is the fugacity of the system , i.e. , @xmath52 , and it is a scaling function of @xmath53 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bnk ] ) .",
    "we calculate now , using the standard thermodynamical relations , the average number of particles in the system , @xmath54 , which turns out to be equal to the @xmath0 parameter of the nbmd : @xmath55 consistently with the above mentioned relation @xmath56 .",
    "we also obtain that the average number of particles per clan , @xmath4 , is a function only of the fugacity of the system : @xmath57 this result is very interesting because formally , as already pointed out , @xmath35 is a scaling function of @xmath53 , and experimentally @xmath4 is seen to vary with the width of the rapidity interval at fixed c.m .",
    "energy : if one were to identify ( pseudo-)rapidity with volume , one would expect that changing @xmath58 at fixed c.m .",
    "energy would imply changing the volume at constant temperature and fugacity ( intensive variables ) , thus keeping @xmath4 constant , contrary to observations .",
    "we must conclude that in the present approach we can not identify rapidity with volume as a simple thought would suggest but we should allow volume to vary also with other physical quantities .",
    "we now turn our attention to the generating function ( g.f . ) for the multiplicity distribution , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) . in the general case illustrated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gcprob ] ) we easily find @xmath59 which is the ratio of the grand - canonical partition function ( or of the void probability ) at two different fugacities .",
    "this is a very general expression valid for any system in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "the g.f . for a cpd can always be written as @xmath60 , \\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the g.f .",
    "for the multiplicity distribution within each clan ( it satisfies @xmath62 ) .    because of eq .",
    "( [ eq : clans ] ) we can write for the class of cpds : @xmath63 however , @xmath64 , hence we obtain @xmath65\\ ] ] which can be interpreted as a function of the _ difference _ in the average numbers of clans for a system with fugacity @xmath66 to that for a system at the actual fugacity @xmath10 , keeping the same volume and temperature . for the g.f .  within one clan",
    "we further find : @xmath67 interestingly , this is the _ ratio _ of the average number of clans for two systems with unequal fugacities .",
    "in addition it is interesting to remark that , remembering that parameter @xmath5 depends on @xmath22 and @xmath23 , a complete thermodynamics can be built in the just mentioned framework .",
    "its main quantities are listed in the following and explicitly calculated in the appendix .",
    "the equation of state is @xmath68 thus the average number of clans can be expressed in terms of the thermodynamic potential @xmath69 : @xmath70    the helmholtz free energy can be rewritten in a form symmetric in @xmath0 and @xmath5 : @xmath71    the average internal energy is @xmath72    the entropy is @xmath73 which coincides with @xmath74 in the limit of @xmath75 , which gives also @xmath76 .    in the next section we will focus our attention on clan thermodynamics of final charged particle md .",
    "in this section an attempt is made in order to interpret in the present approach a surprising finding in some of the possible scenarios for hadron hadron collisions in the tev region discussed in references @xcite , i.e. the unexpected decrease with c.m .",
    "energy of the average number of clans for semihard events in scenarios 2 and 3 .",
    "we are guided by two considerations .",
    "1 ) the occurrence of the nb(pascal)md as it is the case in the scenarios mentioned above both for semihard and soft events is usually interpreted as the result of a two step process : to the independent production of clans during the first step , it follows their decay according to a logarithmic distribution , which can be obtained by a weighted average of geometric ( bose - einstein ) distributions during the second step .",
    "2 ) the validity of the generalised local parton hadron duality ( glphd ) .    it should be pointed out that clan ancestors are independently produced and poissonianly distributed , by assumption , and a clan is , by definition , a group of partons of common ancestor ; a clan consists of at least one parton , its ancestor .",
    "each ancestor can be considered as an independent intermediate gluon source .",
    "all correlations among generated partons are exhausted within each clan .",
    "clan ancestors can be produced either very early in the production process at higher virtualities or later at lower virtualities .    in the first case ,",
    "the ancestor s `` temperature '' ( an unknown function in this approach of the average @xmath77 and the rapidity ) is expected to be higher : this expectation , together with the lack of mutual correlations among ancestors , emphasises their overall quasi - classical behaviour : ancestor production in this case is competitive with the increase of gluon population within each clan .",
    "this situation is qualitatively closer to that expected at hadron level for soft events and semihard events in scenario 1 .    in the second case ancestors",
    "are produced later , at lower virtualities : their `` temperature '' should also be lower , with even `` colder '' generated gluons .",
    "their virtuality is lower .",
    "accordingly , quantum effects should be expected to be enhanced in events sharing these properties : new produced gluons prefer to stay together with other relatives within each clan than to become ancestor and initiate a new clan .",
    "@xmath5 parameter is in this case lower and closer to that of a bose - einstein distribution , which occurs for @xmath78 .",
    "these remarks are consistent with the interpretation of @xmath79 ( see @xcite ) as a measure of aggregation of partons into clans : it corresponds to the ratio of the probability to have two gluons ( particles at hadron level ) in the same clan over the probability to have two gluons in two separate clans , i.e. , to smaller @xmath5 parameter corresponds an higher aggregation among produced gluons into clans .",
    "in addition , being @xmath79 linked to the integral of two parton rapidity correlations via second order factorial cumulants , the decrease of @xmath5 implies stronger two parton correlations . in conclusion generated",
    "gluons prefer to stay together than to stay far apart , higher parton density regions are generated , the probability to create a new gluon is enhanced ( a typical quantum effect ) , clans become more populated and their average number is reduced .",
    "this situation is closer qualitatively to that expected at hadron level for semihard events in scenarios 2 and 3 of references @xcite .    the just mentioned considerations and eq.s ( [ eq : nbar = lnb ] ) , ( [ eq : q=1^k ] ) and ( [ eq : nc = bonly ] ) of section [ sec : thenbd ] fully outline in the present approach the importance of the behaviour of the fugacity variable @xmath35 .",
    "the remaining question is how clan thermodynamics results at parton level can be extended to final particles through the hadronization mechanism .",
    "a possible answer to this question comes from generalised local parton - hadron duality ( glphd ) @xcite which says that all inclusive distributions are proportional at the two levels of investigation : @xmath80 which corresponds for nbmd parameters to @xmath81 glphd can be applied separately to soft and semihard components thus solving our problem . in particular in this framework",
    "minijets production is related to the existence of regions of high gluon densities and final particle production should be sensitive to the mentioned quantum effects , by increasing two particle correlations and be effects .",
    "motivated by these considerations , the behaviour of parameter @xmath35 as a function of c.m .",
    "energy , as well as the @xmath35 dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 have been explored as a suggestive example in the different above mentioned scenarios phenomenologically described in terms of nbmd s .",
    "in addition in view of their simple connections with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the probability of having no particles in the event , @xmath31 , and the void scaling function , @xmath82 , have been studied as a function of fugacity @xmath35 .",
    "it turns out that the analysis in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath82 variables confirms the main result of the new approach , i.e. , that the reduction of the average number of clans with the increase of c.m .  energy is a quantum effect .",
    "we proceed now to discuss the thermodynamical behaviour of multiparticle production according to the scenarios described in the introduction and fully characterised by the c.m .",
    "energy dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nk ] .",
    "we start with the soft component thermodynamical behaviour since it is assumed to be the same in all above mentioned scenarios ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : soft ] ) .",
    "we observe that fugacity @xmath35 is growing very fast from 0.25 to 0.75 with c.m .",
    "energies below 100 gev and then smoothly varying from 0.75 up to 0.9 at 14 tev .",
    "the explanation of this behaviour will be given in terms of the following three known possible interpretation of the occurrence on nb(pascal)md in high energy physics phenomenology , which in terms of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath5 are :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "notice that for @xmath86 , i.e.  for @xmath78 , the md @xmath7 becomes a bose - einstein distribution , for @xmath87 , i.e.  @xmath88 , a poissonian distribution ( the poissonian limit ) and for @xmath89 a logarithmic distribution , which can be expressed as the superposition of bose - einstein distributions .",
    "@xmath90    where @xmath3 is the average number of clans and @xmath4 the average number of particles per clan .    @xmath91    where @xmath31 is the probability of generating zero charged particles and @xmath82 is the void scaling function ; the occurrence of scaling in the product of the first two moments @xmath0 and @xmath79 indicates two particle correlation dominance for hierarchical systems , and the distance from point one ( poisson limit @xmath92 ) on the scaling function is larger , more numerous and correlated are the particles .",
    "it should be pointed out that @xmath93 parameter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : x.a ] ) coincides with the fugacity @xmath35 discussed above in our thermodynamical approach and therefore @xmath35 , like @xmath82 , is a scaling function of @xmath53 , and @xmath94 parameter corresponds to the average charged multiplicity , @xmath0 , for a classical system ( @xmath88 ) .    in this sense",
    "the relative behaviour of @xmath95 and @xmath96 as the c.m .",
    "energy increases in view of eq .",
    "( [ eq : x.a ] ) and the discussion at the beginning of this section , can be considered an indication of the relative importance of a behaviour closer to a quantum one , i.e.  harder , with respect to a behaviour closer to a quasi - classical , i.e.  softer , for a class of events . a very slow increase of @xmath35 with c.m .",
    "energy and an almost constant behaviour of @xmath96 is the main characteristic of the class of soft events as shown in figures [ fig : soft]a and [ fig : soft]b .",
    "this fact is confirmed by inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : soft]c and d , where it is shown that @xmath3 is a very slow growing function of the fugacity of the system throughout the isr region and below that region ( @xmath97 ) , and then a quickly growing function of the same variable in the gev region up to 14 in the tev region ( 14 tev ) ; @xmath4 as a function of the fugacity has a similar behaviour from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "accordingly , the probability of creating zero charged particles , @xmath31 , is decreasing throughout the same regions from @xmath100 to @xmath101 ( for @xmath102 at 14 tev c.m .",
    "energy ) ; in addition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : soft]f ) the void scaling function @xmath103 turns out to populate for larger values of fugacity variable sections of the curve far from the poissonian limit ( @xmath92 ) showing a clear increase of two particle correlations in this region as expected for a hierarchical system .",
    "it should be noticed that in the soft scenario ( no minijets ) constant @xmath5 parameter behaviour in rapidity intervals as requested by kno scaling in the gev and tev regions implies that also the other variables remain constant in the same regions .    in scenario 1 ,",
    "as already pointed out , the semihard component is assumed to have a very similar behaviour to the soft one : kno scaling is satisfied and minor changes in the general trend of the variables both in full phase space and in ( pseudo)rapidity intervals are straightforward consequences of the smaller constant @xmath5 parameter value suggested by nb fits for the semihard component in the gev and extrapolated to the tev region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : semi1 ] ) .    coming to the second scenario",
    "the assumption of strong kno scaling violation for the semihard component ( an extreme point of view with respect to that of scenario 1 ) implies a completely new panorama with dramatic changes .",
    "fugacity @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : semi2]a ) is growing very fast from 0.4 at 200 gev c.m .",
    "energy up to 0.96 at 14 tev almost saturating the maximum allowed value , which is one , and @xmath94 parameter ( fig .  [ fig : semi2]b ) is decreasing very rapidly from @xmath104 at 200 gev to @xmath99 at 14 tev .",
    "the combined information contained in the two figures leads to the same conclusion , i.e.  the proposed semihard scenario behaviour is much closer to a quantum one than the soft scenario favouring the production of regions of higher particle density .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by studying general trends of the other variables as a function of fugacity @xmath35 .",
    "the average number of clans @xmath3 is decreasing in full phase space from @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) to @xmath107 at 14 tev ( @xmath108 ) and the average number per clan , @xmath109 is increasing from @xmath110 to @xmath111 in the same interval . accordingly",
    "the probability of zero particle production is increasing from @xmath112 to @xmath113 , i.e.   gap probability is increasing with fugacity and c.m .",
    "energy ; in parallel void scaling function @xmath114 is populating sections with much higher @xmath35 values than in scenario 1 corresponding to regions much farther from the poissonian limit .",
    "one interesting point concerns smaller ( pseudo)rapidity intervals ( say @xmath115 ) :",
    "the general trend is that @xmath3 is lower than in full phase space as are corresponding @xmath4 values , thus suggesting the onset of regions with higher particle densities and lower temperatures .",
    "the probability of generating zero particles , in view of the higher densities , is therefore much higher and the void probability is far from the poisson limit .",
    "scenario 3 is a qcd inspired scenario for the semihard component : it assumes for parameter @xmath5 a qcd behaviour ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : semi3 ] ) .",
    "this scenario gives a panorama for our variables which is intermediate between the two extremes , 1 and 2 .",
    "fugacity @xmath35 is increasing very fast with c.m .",
    "energy as in scenario 2 , but @xmath94 parameter has a sweeter trend ( it is @xmath116 at 14 tev ) indicating stronger independent production ; this fact is clearly shown in fig  [ fig : semi3]c , d where @xmath3 is larger and @xmath4 smaller than in scenario 2 .",
    "differences in @xmath31 and @xmath82 behaviours in full phase space as well as in ( pseudo)rapidity intervals with respect to scenario 2 are all consequences of the just mentioned remarks .",
