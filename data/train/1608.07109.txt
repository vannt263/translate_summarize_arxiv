    "in classical computation , memory is a trivial resource , implemented simply by making copies of digital information in long - lived memory hardware , and retrieving the information at later stages for further processing . in quantum computation , this is forbidden by the fundamental inability of arbitrary quantum states to be faithfully copied , as dictated by the no - cloning theorem@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the absence of additional resources or quantum error correction , the storage of a quantum bit ( qubit ) is limited by the intrinsic coherence time of the physical qubit that holds the information .",
    "` quantum memories ' surpass the storage limits of a given physical qubit by transferring the quantum information onto a ` memory qubit ' which is less susceptible to environmental noise and dephasing , then returning the information to the preferred ` processing qubit ' when required , once again allowing fast manipulation and/or readout . alternatively , memory qubits can serve the purpose of storing a ` flying qubit ' such as a photon in a long - lived solid - state system@xcite .",

    "recent experiments have shown the great potential of donor qubits for quantum information processing @xcite , and some new proposals for large - scale architectures based on @xmath0p suggest the swapping of quantum states between electron and nucleus to optimize gate speeds and operation fidelities @xcite .",
    "storage of the classical @xcite or the quantum @xcite state of p electron spins onto their @xmath0p nuclei has been demonstrated in ensemble experiments .",
    "however , quantum memory demonstrations at the single - qubit level have so far been limited to trapped ions@xcite and to defects in diamond@xcite .",
    "here we present the experimental demonstration of storage and retrieval of quantum information between the electron and the nucleus of a single @xmath0p donor in isotopically enriched @xmath1si . for brief storage times",
    "we achieve an overall process fidelity of @xmath7  % , well beyond the classical limit of @xmath8@xcite , and we show that storage times can be extended up to 80 ms via dynamical decoupling ( dd ) of the nuclear spin memory .",

    "the large zeeman splitting between the @xmath28 and @xmath31 states ensures that only an electron in the @xmath31 state can escape the donor , leaving behind a positive charge that shifts the set bias point and resulting in a current spike detectable in single - shot@xcite .",
    "this provides both readout of the electron spin state and initialisation into a @xmath28 state , since only an electron in the @xmath28 can tunnel back to the donor .",

    "the remaining errors are largely due to a systematic shift in the instantaneous esr frequency induced by application of rf pulses , causing errors in rotation angle and phase during both the initialisation and the memory sequences ( see pulse - induced resonance shift below ) . estimating the errors in process matrix elements requires repeated applications of the maximum likelihood procedure described in refs .",

    "a monte carlo distribution of 20,000 process matrices and sets of state fidelities were generated .",
    "the standard deviations in the set of 20,000 results were used to estimate the error in the calculated fidelities .",
    "relatively high power rf pulses are required in the transfer and recovery stages of the sequence to ensure that the transfer time is short compared to the electron dephasing time ( @xmath88  @xmath47s)@xcite . following the application of these high - power rf pulses it was found that the electron spin resonance frequency @xmath89 exhibits a transient shift , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "the frequency detuning ( @xmath90 ) is @xmath9110 khz and lasts on the order of 200 @xmath47s .",
    "the curves show that there is a correlation between the shift in electron resonance ( blue ) and a small increase in the current through the set ( red ) following the rf pulse . in this test",
    ", the rf pulse was tuned completely off - resonance and any frequency dependence of the effect was negligible over the mhz range of the rf source used . the shift was found to be positive for both esr frequencies ( data not shown ) , implying an effective shift in the zeeman term of the hamiltonian , rather than in the hyperfine coupling .",
    "we found no causal link between the set current and the frequency detuning , i.e. deliberately running a current through the set does not shift @xmath89 .",
    "the physical origin of this mechanism is thus currently unknown . in the present experiment ,",
    "this pulse - induced resonance shift results in a different instantaneous electron resonance frequency during the ` initialization ' mw pulse ( which precedes any rf pulse ) and during the endor sequences , preventing us from achieving perfect initialization and/or state transfer . in the practice , we chose a compromise where the mw source is slightly detuned from the instantaneous electron resonance under both conditions .",
    "we anticipate that improved memory fidelities will be achieved once the pulse - induced resonance shift is understood and mitigated .      as a result of the long coherence time of the nuclear spin",
    ", the process fidelity decays very slowly with storage time .",
    "for instance we measure @xmath85=74@xmath713% after 10 ms , corresponding to a memory fidelity @xmath92% .",
    "high - fidelity storage can be extended to longer times by dynamically decoupling the nuclear spin .",
    "figure 6(a ) shows the probability of recovering an initial @xmath42-state as a function of storage time , for different numbers of dd pulses applied to the nucleus during storage .",
    "this can be thought of as the cpmg coherence time , @xmath93 of the memory storage process .",
    "figure 6(b ) compares this memory @xmath93 ( black ) to nuclear cpmg coherence times ( red ) with varying number @xmath94 of applied cpmg pulses .",
    "both values approach 80 ms for @xmath95 pulses , with the memory following a similar trend to that of the neutral nucleus .",
    "electron cpmg coherence times , shown in blue , are shorter than the nuclear and memory times for small @xmath94 , but tend to approach them for higher number of cpmg pulses .",
    "the values of @xmath93 as a function of @xmath94 show increase in proportion to @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the electron , nucleus and memory , respectively .",
    "the different trend of @xmath93 between electron , nucleus and memory as a function of @xmath94 is not fully understood , but is suspected to be related to the pulse - induced resonance shift described above .",
    "we note indeed that the neutral nucleus coherence times reported here are much longer than those measured in an earlier experiment on the same device @xcite , where much higher rf powers were used .",
    "this suggests that there might be a pulse - induced resonance shift on the nuclear spin as well  too small to be detected directly as we did for the electron ( figure 5 ) , but large enough to perturb the coherent evolution of the nuclear spin .",
    "while this can be mitigated to some extent by reducing the rf power , the memory protocol requires nuclear @xmath32-pulses shorter than the electron dephasing time @xmath99",
    "@xmath47s @xcite for faithful transfer of the electron state to the nucleus .",
    "we found the best results by choosing memory transfer rf @xmath32-pulses of duration 50 @xmath47s , and lower - power @xmath32-pulses ( 97 @xmath47s ) applied for dd during the storage phase .",
    "in conclusion , we have experimentally demonstrated a nuclear spin quantum memory using a single p atom in silicon . the memory coherence time (",
    "up to 80 ms ) and the memory process fidelity ( better than 90% ) are comparable to those found in nitrogen - vacancy centres in diamond@xcite , trapped ions@xcite and p - atom ensembles@xcite . we have identified a likely cause of the coherence and fidelity limitations , namely a shift in the instantaneous electron resonance frequency after applying rf pulses .",
    "future work will focus on understanding and eliminating this pulse - induced frequency shift , in order to demonstrate quantum memory fidelities approaching the values of gate fidelity ( @xmath100% ) already observed for the operation of the electron and nuclear spin qubits individually@xcite .",
