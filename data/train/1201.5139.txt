    "the two dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model has been extensively investigated because at @xmath1-filling it can successfully describe the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phases found in many strongly - correlated materials . since afm phases often occur in materials displaying unconventional superconductivity ( sc ) , such as the high-@xmath3 cuprates and the organic @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath4x ( hereafter @xmath2-(et)@xmath4x ) charge transfer solid ( cts ) superconductors , it has frequently been suggested that some small modification of the model can yield a superconducting state where the residual afm fluctuations mediate an attractive pairing interaction . in the case of the cuprates , this modification involves a change in the carrier concentration ( `` doping '' ) ; the doped 2d hubbard model has been intensively investigated with numerous analytic and numerical methods , but whether or not sc occurs within this model is still controversial .",
    "the afm state in the 2d hubbard model can also be destroyed at fixed carrier concentration by the introduction of lattice frustration .",
    "the model on the anisotropic triangular lattice ( see fig .  [ phasediag ] ) has been used to describe the @xmath2-(et)@xmath4x family of cts , where sc occurs at fixed carrier density under application of moderate pressure .",
    "the et layers here consist of strongly dimerized anisotropic triangular lattices , with the intradimer hopping integrals much larger than the interdimer ones . each ( et)@xmath5 dimer contains one hole carrier on the average .",
    "this has been used to justify replacing each dimer unit cell with a single site , and the underlying @xmath6-filled cation band with an _ effective _ @xmath1-filled band @xcite .",

    "[ phasediag ] ) .",
    "the limits @xmath17 and 1 correspond to the square and the isotropic triangular lattices , respectively .",
    "all quantities with dimensions of energy will be expressed hereafter in units of @xmath12 .",
    "we consider only the @xmath1-filled band corresponding to an electron density per site @xmath18 .",
    "the non - superconducting phases of this model , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] , are relatively well established .",
    "as @xmath15 is increased in strength , frustration destroys the * q*=(@xmath19,@xmath19 ) afm ground state , replacing it with either a paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) state or a non - magnetic insulator ( nmi ) state @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations on this model and the related model with two diagonal @xmath15 bonds in each plaquette have confirmed the presence of the pm , afm , and nmi phases @xcite .",
    "the nmi phase has been suggested as a candidate state @xcite that explains the apparent quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) behavior seen in the strongly frustrated @xmath2-(et)@xmath4cu@xmath4(cn)@xmath20 @xcite . as the nmi phase has already been extensively investigated @xcite , in the present work we will not consider the properties of this phase any further , but",
    "will rather focus on the possibility of sc within the model .",
    "numerous mean - field theories have suggested that unconventional sc occurs adjacent to afm - pm phase boundaries @xcite .",
    "similar superconducting states have been suggested for the closely related hubbard - heisenberg model on the same lattice @xcite .",
    "because of the proximity of ( @xmath19,@xmath19 ) afm order , the suggested symmetry of the sc order parameter is @xmath21 . for @xmath22",
    "the magnetic ordering * q * shifts to ( @xmath23,@xmath23 ) corresponding to the 120@xmath24 ordering found in the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , and consequently superconducting other order parameter symmetries have been suggested @xcite .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath15 for the @xmath2-et materials is however smaller than 1 ( see below ) @xcite , and also no evidence for 120@xmath24 afm order is found experimentally within the @xmath2-et family @xcite .",
    "superconducting pair - pair correlations calculated with numerical methods going beyond mean field theory provide a more accurate assessment of the presence of sc , provided finite - size effects can be adequately controlled .",
    "two criteria must be satisfied to confirm sc within the model : ( i ) the superconducting pair - pair correlations must be enhanced over the @xmath25 values over at least a range of @xmath0 , and ( ii ) the pair - pair correlations must extrapolate to a finite value at long inter - pair distances .",
    "we have previously calculated pair - pair correlations for the 4@xmath264 lattice using exact diagonalization @xcite .",
    "no enhancement of the pair - pair correlations by @xmath0 was found in these calculations , except for a trivial short - distance enhancement @xcite ( see also below ) .",
    "our present work allows more careful analyses of the distance dependence of the pair - pair correlations , as well as the u - dependence of the longer - range components of these correlations , that were not possible within the earlier small cluster calculation .",
    "pair - pair correlations for lattices comparable to those in the present work have also been calculated using variational quantum monte carlo ( vmc ) methods @xcite .",
    "vmc results however depend to a great degree on the choice of the variational wavefunction , and there is considerable differences of opinion within the existing vmc literature . clearly , studies of pair - pair correlations on large lattices , using many - body methods that do not depend on an a priori choice of the wavefunction are desirable . a candidate method for calculations of strongly - correlated systems",
    "is the recently developed path integral renormalization group ( pirg ) method @xcite . like vmc , pirg is also variational and does not suffer from a fermion sign problem as do standard quantum monte carlo methods . unlike vmc methods however , instead of an assumed functional form of the wavefunction , pirg uses an _",

    "the nmi phase within eq .",
    "[ ham ] was first identified using pirg @xcite .",

    "] , we use the most accurate version of the pirg ground - state method , quantum projection - pirg ( qp - pirg ) , which combines symmetries with the renormalization procedure @xcite .",
    "as explained in section [ pirg ] , we also performed an `` annealing '' procedure to help prevent the method from converging to local minima .    while early tight - binding bandstructures calculated using the extended hckel method found some @xmath2-et superconductors to have nearly isotropic triangular lattices with @xmath27 , recent ab - initio methods have determined that @xmath15 in the experimental systems lie within the range @xmath28 @xcite . importantly , in this range of anisotropy the 120@xmath24 afm order is not relevant .",
    "furthermore , the afm order is known experimentally to be of the conventional nel pattern @xcite .",
    "consequently , we limit our calculations to @xmath29 . specifically , we perform our calculations for three distinct @xmath30 , 0.5 , and 0.8 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] .",
    "the two large @xmath15 values chosen bracket the estimated frustration in the @xmath2-et superconductors @xcite .",
    "we choose a smaller @xmath30 in addition because it has been suggested in some studies that sc is present even in the weakly frustrated region of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram ( fig .  [ phasediag ] ) is qualitatively different at @xmath30 because the nmi phase does not occur for @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "while the estimate for degree of frustration is remarkably consistent between different ab - inito methods @xcite , the estimated value of @xmath0 for @xmath2-(et)@xmath4x is less certain .",
    "we therefore perform our calculations over a range of @xmath0 starting from @xmath25 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ oparams ] ,",
    "we introduce definitions of the order parameters we calculate . in section [ pirg ]",
    "we describe the pirg method .",
    "section [ results ] presents our data for @xmath30 , 0.5 , and 0.8 , followed by discussions and conclusion in section [ discussion ] .",
    "to determine whether sc is present near the metal - insulator ( mi ) transition , in addition to superconducting correlations we need order parameters to distinguish between metallic and insulating phases . to locate the mi transition we use two different quantities .",
    "the first is the double occupancy @xmath32 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , a discontinuous decrease in @xmath33 occurs at the mi transition @xcite .",
    "in addition , we calculate the bond order @xmath34 between sites @xmath10 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 in the following we have labeled the bond order between sites linked by the @xmath15 bond as @xmath37 .",
    "this particular bond order is nonzero in the pm phase but tends to zero in the afm nel ordered phase because there electrons on sites connected by @xmath15 have parallel spin projections @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath38 creates a singlet pair on lattice sites @xmath10 and @xmath35 : @xmath39 the pair - pair correlation function is defined as @xmath40 in eq .",

    "in the presence of superconducting long - range order , @xmath48 for the ground state in the appropriate pairing channel must converge to a nonzero value for @xmath49 .",
    "this is seen clearly for example in the 2d @xmath50 hubbard model @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",

    "we found the addition of these two global updates to significantly improve the accuracy of the results .",
    "we also incorporated lattice and spin - parity symmetries in the calculation @xcite .",
    "reference introduced two different methods of using symmetry projection : ( i ) pirg - qp , where symmetry projectors are applied to the ground state wavefunction after it has optimized using pirg ; and ( ii ) qp - pirg , where symmetry projectors are applied at each step of the pirg optimization .",

    "while mean - field theories suggest a different mechanism for each different semiconductor - superconductor transition , it appears unlikely to us that structurally similar materials , with identical molecular components in some cases , should require different mechanisms for sc . given how difficult a problem correlated - electron sc has turned out to be we suggest that an alternate approach is to determine first how to construct a theoretical framework within which a unified theory of sc begins to look feasible , and then to search for the same .",
    "we have recently shown how it may be possible to construct such a framework for the cts @xcite . in this picture , the @xmath2-(et)@xmath4x and other dimerized cts should be described in terms of the _ underlying @xmath6-filled band _ as with the other cts superconductors @xcite . in the presence of strong dimerization and relatively weak frustration , afm wins . under increasing frustration though",
    ", a transition occurs from afm with uniform charge density on each dimer to a charge - ordered paired singlet state we have termed the paired electron crystal ( pec ) @xcite .",
    "experimental examples of the pec in 2d cts include @xmath116-(_meso_-dmbedt - ttf)@xmath4pf@xmath117 ( reference ) and @xmath118-etme@xmath20p[pd(dmit)@xmath4]@xmath4 ( references ) , _ which have precisely the same co and bond patterns as in the pec model @xcite , _ and are superconducting under pressure .",
    "the application of pressure corresponds to a further increase in frustration and gives the possibility of a paired electron _ liquid _",
    "superconductor @xcite , a realization of the charged boson sc first proposed by schafroth @xcite .",
    "although more work will be necessary to prove this , this theoretical approach has the advantage that it leads to a single model for correlated - electron sc in the cts .",
    "even more interestingly , we have pointed out that there exist several frustrated strongly correlated _",
    "@xmath6-filled superconductors that can perhaps be described within the same model @xcite .    finally , the experimental observation of afm @xcite in expanded fullerides a@xmath20c@xmath120 has led to the modeling of these compounds in terms of a 3d nondegenerate @xmath1-filled band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the threefold degeneracy of the lowest antibonding molecular orbitals in c@xmath120 is removed by jahn - teller instability @xcite .",
    "the observation of a spingap in the antiferromagnetic state validates the nondegenerate description @xcite . the dynamic mean - field theory ( dmft ) proposed for the afm to sc transition in the fullerides within",
    "this 3d effective @xmath1-filled band hubbard model @xcite is however very similar to the dmft theories of sc in the 2d cts @xcite .",
    "our results here suggest that a reexamination of the spin - fluctuation mechanism of sc in the fullerides may also be called for .",
