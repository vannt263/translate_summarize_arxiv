    "the extreme environment offered in many astrophysical situations , such as supernovae and binary mergers , in many cases give rise to new and exciting physics , e.g.neutrinoplasma interactions and gravitational waves .",
    "furthermore , the next generation laser - plasma systems promises to take laboratory astrophysics into new realms , as tens to hundreds of petawatts , or even zetawatts , may be generated in femtosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "thus , as observational astronomy and cosmology grows even more accurate , and laboratory techniques continue to develop at the current rate , one will be able to probe new physics , such as neutron star equations of state @xcite or the unruh  hawking effect @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been noted that the inclusion of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) into plasma theory may give rise to novel wave modes @xcite , in particular in dusty plasmas @xcite .",
    "these wave modes could propagate in a variety of environments , such as supernovae remnants , interstellar clouds , or laser - dusty plasma systems .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found , using the method of characteristics , that ultra - strong magnetic fields may induce shock front formation in electromagnetic radiation , analogous to hydrodynamic shocks .",
    "a possible application to such a scenario is magnetars , where field strengths of the order @xmath0 can be found .    in the present paper , we show that the nonlinear propagation of electromagnetic waves in a a weakly magnetized dusty plasma may give rise to wave steepening and shock formation .",
    "this effect is solely due to the novel qed effect of photon ",
    "photon scattering in a nonlinear quantum vacuum .",
    "the shock front formation may give rise to ponderomotive acceleration of charged particles in , e.g.  interstellar clouds .",
    "the results are discussed for astrophysical energy scales .",
    "in ref .  @xcite the dispersion relation @xmath1\\frac{k^2c^2}{\\omega^2 } - \\frac{\\omega_{pd}^2\\gamma_d   } { \\omega_{cd}(\\omega\\gamma_d - \\omega_{cd } ) } .",
    "\\label{eq : transverse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] was found .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : transverse ] ) is valid for low - frequency circularly electromagnetic polarized waves , with electric field @xmath2 , propagating along a magnetic field @xmath3 moreover , the critical schwinger field is given by @xmath4 v / m ( see , e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath5 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath6 is planck s constant divided by @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the electron rest mass , @xmath9 is the absolute value of the electron charge , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the dust gyro and plasma frequency , respectively . here @xmath12 denotes the dust particle density in the laboratory frame , @xmath13 the dust charge , @xmath14 the dust particle rest mass , and @xmath15 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "next , we introduce the dimensionless variables and parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , and normalize the electric field according to @xmath19 .",
    "we consider the case of ultra - relativistic dust in a weak magnetic field , for which @xcite @xmath20 holds .",
    "the generic evolution equation for a slowly varying envelope @xmath21 following from the dispersion relation ( [ eq : new ] ) reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 has been used .    if the quantum parameter @xmath25 , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : new]we obtain the equation @xmath26 yielding a linear traveling wave solution with the whistler - like dispersion relation @xmath27    in the case of small frequencies , @xmath28 ( the case with a dominant nonlinear term ) , we neglect the third order frequency @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) and obtain @xmath30 thus , letting @xmath31 $ ] the amplitude @xmath32 satisfies the equation @xmath33 while the phase is connected with the amplitude by the equation @xmath34 for simple waves @xcite eq .  ( [ eq : amp ] )",
    "yields the solution    @xmath35    i.e.   @xmath36    where the function @xmath37 is the inverse function of @xmath38 and @xmath38 is determined by the initial condition at @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we have to define the initial condition @xmath40 at @xmath39 and then find @xmath41 . as eq .",
    "( [ eq : steep2 ] ) shows , the wave steepening due to nonlinearity may occur .",
    "this can also be seen via eq .",
    "( [ eq : steep1 ] ) , from which we find that @xmath42 where @xmath43 .    1 .   if @xmath44 ( which can be interpreted as the initial function @xmath45 at @xmath39 decreasing with @xmath46 ) , we have at time @xmath47 that @xmath48 , if the plus is chosen in front of the @xmath49-term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : div ] ) .",
    "2 .   if we , on the other hand , have @xmath50 , we choose the minus sign in front of the @xmath49-term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : div ] ) , and obtain the shock front formation for a finite time .",
    "thus , we clearly have the shock wave formation at this instant @xcite . starting with a gaussian pulse , case ( a ) implies the wave steepening and the shock front formation in the leading part of the pulse , while case ( b ) implies the wave steepening in the tail of the pulse , which can be seen by a simple spatial reflection symmetry .",
    "we note that in principle density gradient effects in the dusty plasma should be taken into account once significant steepening occurs , but this turns out to be a higher order effect .    in the weakly nonlinear case",
    ", we may use eq .",
    "( [ eq : prop ] ) to simplify the general pulse evolution equation ( [ eq : general ] ) , using @xmath51 . assuming a slowly varying envelope @xmath21 , eq.([eq : general ] ) yields @xmath52 which is the well - known nonlinear schrdinger equation with a focusing nonlinearity .",
    "thus , such an equation admits the formation of a bright soliton @xcite given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the amplitude , and we have assumed that the soliton has the peak value at @xmath55 located at @xmath56 .",
    "thus , in the weakly nonlinear case , a balance between the dispersive and nonlinear effects may be struck .",
    "however , in practice , the coherence length of such structures could be short , due to e.g.   plasma inhomogeneities . moreover , while the one - dimensional bright soliton is stable , higher dimensional effects may yield instabilities .",
    "it is interesting thought that such structures could form with rather modest parameter values , as will be discussed next .",
    "the effect of the wave steepening and intense shock front formation presented here takes place whenever the electromagnetic intensity is high in the dusty plasma .",
    "thus , a natural question arises : what are the situations when this may occur ? as astrophysical systems offer extreme energy scales , these are natural places to look for qed effects , such as the one presented here .",
    "moreover , the presence of dusty plasmas is well known in a wide range of astrophysical environments @xcite , such as supernovae @xcite and interstellar clouds @xcite . in the case of interstellar clouds",
    ", we have an expected dust density of the order @xmath57 @xcite , with a typical dust mass @xmath58 @xcite . a value @xmath59 ( well within the limits for such environments ) results in @xmath60 . if the circularly polarized wave satisfy @xmath61 , a value appropriate at a distance of 1au from a supernova , we have @xmath62 , thus giving an appreciable nonlinearity in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : amp ] ) and ( [ eq : nlse ] ) .    in fig .  1 we have plotted the pulse evolution in two different cases .",
    "the upper panel represents the positive sign of eq .",

    "we have used the initial pulse amplitude @xmath63 $ ] , with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . moreover",
    ", the initial amplitude satisfies @xmath66 , thus well within the limits posed by , e.g.  interstellar clouds at 1au from a supernova .",
    "we have plotted the evolution of @xmath67 .",
    "the effect of the nonlinearity can clearly be seen in the form of the wave steepening .",
    "one interesting aspect of the shock front formation is the possibility of charged particle acceleration due to the ponderomotive force .",
    "however , before conclusions can be drawn on possible particle acceleration , analysis of mechanisms rendering the pulse wave front less steep must be made .",
