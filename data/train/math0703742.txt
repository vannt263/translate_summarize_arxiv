    "a sparse graph which has high connectivity properties is called an expander graph .",
    "expander graphs have many applications , such as complexity theory ( @xcite ) , derandomization ( @xcite , @xcite ) and error correcting codes ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "connectivity properties of an expander graph are measured by several expansion parameters , which are related to each other . in this paper",
    "we consider the spectral expansion as a measure of connectivity .",
    "it can be interpreted as the rate at which a random walk on the graph converges to its stationary distribution .",
    "many articles show that almost every regular graph has good expansion properties theoretically ( @xcite , @xcite ) or practically ( @xcite , @xcite ) , based on randomization arguments .",
    "also many authors proposed explicit construction of expander graphs using number theory or group theory ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand , reingold et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a new graph operation called a zig - zag product and succeeded in constructing larger expander graphs by iteratively applying the product .",
    "the zig - zag product requires two graphs and generates a graph which preserves the spectral expansions of the component graphs to some degree .",
    "originally the zig - zag product was defined only for regular undirected graphs , but later reingold et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) extended the definition to directed graphs with an application to complexity theory .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a generalization of the zig - zag product of regular directed graphs .",
    "it requires three graphs and also controls the resulting spectral expansion in terms of the spectral expansions of the three components .",
    "we derive an upper bound on the spectral expansion of the generalized zig - zag product .",
    "our upper bound improves on the bounds in reingold et al .",
    "( @xcite,@xcite ) when applied to the zig - zag product .",
    "additionally we consider a special case of the generalized zig - zag product , where one of the components is a trivial graph whose edges are all self - loops .",
    "we call it a reduced zig - zag product",
    ". the spectral expansion of the reduced product itself is 1 , which is the worst case .",
    "however we derive a bound for the powers of the reduced product , which is similar to the bound in the generalized zig - zag product .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give notations and preliminary definitions . in section 3",
    "we define the generalized zig - zag product and related graph operations . in section 4",
    "we derive an upper bound for the spectral expansion of the zig - zag product and the powers of the reduced zig - zag product . in section 5",
    "we present some results of numerical experiments to compare the spectral expansion of the zig - zag product and its bound given in section 4 .",
    "in this paper , we consider digraphs which may have multiple edges and self - loops . in a digraph ,",
    "the outdegree of a vertex is the number of edges leaving the vertex , and the indegree of a vertex is the number of edges entering the vertex .",
    "a digraph is @xmath0-outregular if every vertex has the outdegree @xmath0 , and @xmath0-inregular if every vertex has the indegree @xmath0 .",

    "let @xmath17}x_v y_v$ ] and @xmath18 denote the standard inner product and the standard euclidean norm in @xmath16 .",
    "we characterize the rate of convergence by the following parameter called the spectral expansion .",

    "the spectral expansion of @xmath1 is defined as @xmath19    in the case that @xmath1 is undirected , @xmath20 is the second largest eigenvalue ( in absolute value ) of the symmetric matrix @xmath3 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in general , following fill @xcite and mihail @xcite , @xmath20 is the square root of the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath21 , which also means the second largest singular value of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath22 is our initial distribution , then @xmath23 and @xmath24 are orthogonal to @xmath25 .",
