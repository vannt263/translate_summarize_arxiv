    "the internal momentum distribution of valence quarks in hadrons are fundamental to qcd .",
    "they are generated from the valence light - cone wave functions integrated over @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the intrinsic transverse momentum of the valence constituents and @xmath6 , the total momentum transfer squared .",
    "even though these amplitudes were calculated about 20 years ago , there have been no direct measurements until those reported here .",
    "the pion wave function can be expanded in terms of fock states : @xmath7 two functions have been proposed to describe the momentum distribution amplitude for the quark and antiquark in the @xmath8 configuration .",
    "the asymptotic function was calculated using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) methods @xcite , and is the solution to the pqcd evolution equation for very large @xmath6 ( @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 @xmath11 is the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the pion carried by the quark in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "it should not be confused with @xmath12 which is not specific to a single fock state .",
    "the antiquark carries a fraction ( @xmath13 ) . using qcd sum rules , chernyak and zhitnitsky @xcite proposed a function that is expected to be correct for low q@xmath14 : @xmath15 as can be seen from eqns .",
    "[ asy ] and [ cz ] and from fig .",
    "[ fig : x_mc ] , there is a large difference between the two functions .",
    "measurements of form factors are insensitive to the wave function as these quantities are derived by integrating over the wave function and interpretation of the results is model dependent @xcite . in this work",
    "we describe an experimental study that maps the momentum distribution of the valence @xmath8 in the pion .",
    "this provides the first direct measurement of the pion light - cone wave function ( squared ) .",
    "the concept of the measurement is the following : a high energy pion dissociates diffractively on a heavy nuclear target .",
    "this is a coherent process in which the quark and antiquark break apart and hadronize into two jets .",
    "if in this fragmentation process the quark momentum is transferred to the jet , measurement of the jet momentum gives the quark ( and antiquark ) momentum .",
    "thus : @xmath16 from simple kinematics and assuming that the masses of the jets are small compared with the mass of the di - jets , the virtuality and mass - squared of the di - jets are given by : @xmath17 where @xmath5 is the transverse momentum of each jet . by studying the momentum distribution for various @xmath5 bins",
    ", one can observe changes in the apparent fractions of asymptotic and chernyak - zhitnitsky ( cz ) contributions to the pion wave function .",
    "the basic assumption that the momentum carried by the dissociating @xmath18 is transferred to the di - jets was examined by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the asymptotic and ( cz ) wave functions ( squared ) .",
    "the mc samples were allowed to hadronize through the lund pythia - jetset model @xcite and then passed through simulation of the experimental apparatus ( described in the next section ) to simulate the effect of unmeasured neutrals and other experimental distortions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : x_mc ] the initial distributions at the quark level are compared with the final distributions of the detected di - jets . as can be seen ,",
    "the qualitative features of the distributions are retained .",
    "the results of this analysis come from comparing the observed @xmath11-distribution to a combination of the distributions shown , as examples , on the right of figure [ fig : x_mc ] .",
    "the color - transparency ( ct ) phenomenon is derived from the prediction that color fields cancel for physically small color singlet systems of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "this effect of color neutrality ( or color screening ) is expected to lead to the suppression of initial and final state interactions for a small sized system or point - like configuration ( plc ) formed in a large angle hard process @xcite .",
    "observation of ct requires that a plc is formed and that the energies are high enough so that expansion of the plc does not occur @xcite ( the frozen approximation ) . under conditions of @xmath191.5 gev / c , which translates to @xmath20 and @xmath21 fm , observation of these effects can be expected .",
    "bertsch et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that the small @xmath8 component will be filtered by the nucleus .",
    "_ @xcite show that for @xmath22 the interaction with the nucleus is completely coherent and @xmath23di - jets @xmath24 ) is small .",
    "this leads to an @xmath25 dependence of the forward amplitude squared .",
    "fermilab experiment e791 recorded @xmath26 events from interactions of a 500 gev / c @xmath0 beam with carbon and platinum targets .",
    "details of the experiment are given in @xcite .",
    "only about 10% of the e791 data was used for the analysis presented here .",
    "the data were analysed by selecting events in which 90% of the beam momentum was carried by charged particles .",
    "jets were identifies using the jade jet - finding algorithm @xcite . to insure clean selection of two - jet events ,",
    "a minimum @xmath5 of 1.25 gev / c was required and their relative azimuthal angle , which for pure di - jets should be @xmath27 was required to be within @xmath28 of this value .",
    "diffractive di - jets were identified through the @xmath29 dependence of their yield ( @xmath30 is the square of the transverse momentum transferred to the nucleus and @xmath31 where r is the nuclear radius ) . figure  [ difr_a ] shows the @xmath30 distributions of di - jet events from platinum and carbon .",
    "the different slopes in the low @xmath30 coherent region reflect the different nuclear radii .",
    "events in this region come from diffractive dissociation of the pion .    -7.0 cm    -2.0 cm      for measurement of the wave function we used data from the platinum target as it has a sharp diffractive distribution and low background",
    ". we used events with @xmath32 gev / c@xmath14 . for these events ,",
    "the value of @xmath11 was computed from the measured longitudinal momentum of each jet . a background , estimated from the @xmath11 distribution for events with larger @xmath30 was subtracted .",
    "the analysis was carried out in two windows of @xmath5 : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting @xmath11 distributions are shown in fig .",

    ", we fit the results with a linear combination of squares of the two wave functions ( right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : x_mc ] ) .",

    "the coherence length is estimated using @xmath37  =  1000 gev / c and @xmath38 5 @xmath39 .",
    "the result is  @xmath40  10  fm , larger than the platinum nuclear radius . in order to correct for experimental acceptance ,",
    "we generate mc simulations of diffractive di - jets using the asymptotic wave function and di - jet masses of 4,5 , and 6 gev / c .",
    "the simulated coherent @xmath30 distributions of the di - jets represent the nuclear form factors of carbon ( r=2.44 fm ) and platinum ( r=5.27 fm ) @xcite and the incoherent dissociation is simulated according to the nucleon radius ( r=0.8 fm ) @xcite truncated at @xmath41 0.015 .",
    "a combination of these simulations was used to fit the data ( fig .",
    "[ difr_a ] ) .",
    "we derive the numbers of producted di - jet events in the data for each target in three @xmath5 bins by integrating over the diffractive terms in the fits . using the resulting yields and",
    "the known target thicknesses , we determine the ratio of cross sections for diffractive dissociation on platinum and carbon ( the two targets were subjected to essentially the same beam flux ) .",

    "the results are listed in table [ alpha ] and compared with ct theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the results are consistent with those expected from color - transparency calculations and clearly inconsistent with @xmath42 values for incoherent scattering observed in other hadronic interactions .",
    "the photon l.c .",
    "wave function can be described in a way similar to that of the pion except that it has two major components : the electromagnetic and the hadronic .",
    "being a gauge field capable of piont - like coupling it has also a point bare - photon component .",
    "consequently , the photon light - cone wave function in the pqcd regime can be expanded in terms of fock states : @xmath44 where @xmath45 describes the point bare - photon and @xmath46 stands for @xmath47 etc .",
    "the photon can be described as containing @xmath48 components even in the non - pqcd regime of the vector - meson dominance model @xcite , in particular the @xmath49 and @xmath50 mesons .",
    "there is also a @xmath48 component with large relative transverse momentum that is connected to the point - like ( direct ) photon .",
    "the wave function of the photon is very rich : it can be studied for real photons , for virtual photons of various virtualities , for transverse and longitudinal photons and the hadronic component may be decomposed according to the quarks flavor .",
    "strange quarks will reflect the strange content of the photon and charmed quarks will reflect the smaller sized charmed components .",
    "the point - bare photon does not have internal structure , it can only compton - scatter and will not be studied here .",
    "the other electromagnetic fock states begin with @xmath51 and continue to more complex systems .",
    "the interaction of these fock states with the target is expected to be purely electromagnetic , as shown in figure [ diag2](a ) .",
    "these were studied extensively through measurements of bethe - heitler leptoproduction @xcite and of @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "exclusive measurements of the @xmath51 wave function will complement these inclusive measurements , may provide more tests of qed and will help define the analysis tools for the more complex hadronic structure .",
    "the hadronic components interact according to the diagram of fig .",
    "[ diag2](b ) .",
    "the distribution amplitudes for these components , integrated over @xmath5 were calculated by petrov et al .",
    "@xcite using the instanton model and are shown in figure [ phi_we ] .",
    "balitsky et al .",
    "@xcite predict for real photons a distribution amplitude identical to the pion asymptotic function @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : x_mc ] ) .      while a variety of cross sections , form factors etc .",
    "depend on the light - cone wave function they are usually not sensitive to its structure .",
    "this is because it normally enters the calculations in an integrated form .",
    "such are also the photon inclusive structure functions @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "while this is an advantage when one needs calculations that do not depend on the internal structure of the photon , it is a disadvantage if we want to understand it .",
    "a differential measurement which will be sensitive to the @xmath11 and @xmath5 dependence of @xmath54 will test the most fundamental description of the photon internal structure .",
    "such measurements will make it possible to compare with the theoretical predictions and determine the regime of their validity .",
    "the experimental program is presently in preparation and is based on diffractive dissociation of a real or virtual photon into di - leptons or di - jets .",
    "the electromagnetic component will be studied through measurements of the @xmath11 distribution for pure diffractive @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) elastic photoproduction and the @xmath5 distribution of these events .",
    "similar measurements of diffractive hadronic di - jets will be used to study the hadronic component .",
