    "when designing graded index media  where the electric permittivity varies continuously in space  it is useful to know which index profiles will completely absorb incident waves .",
    "such materials ( perfect absorbers ( pas ) ) totally suppress both reflection and transmission . following the birth of transformation optics  @xcite ,",
    "there has been a great deal of interest in finding materials which suppress the scattering of electromagnetic radiation without absorption , as these are an important ingredient in cloaking devices  @xcite .",
    "transformation optics can also be used to design pas .",
    "for example , perfectly matched layers ( pmls )  @xcite are commonly used in numerical simulations to absorb waves without reflection .",
    "however , they generally consist of an anisotropic permittivity and permeability , making them difficult to realise practically . in this work ,",
    "we design non  reflecting , non - transmitting non - magnetic , isotropic graded index media , building on the recent findings on the reflectionlessness of spatial kramers - kronig media  @xcite .    in order for electromagnetic radiation to be absorbed , the material must be lossy , meaning the permittivity is required to have a non - zero imaginary part . to design a pa , it may seem that one just needs to insert a slab of highly lossy material into the system .",
    "however , as the dissipation in the slab is increased , the reflection also increases until eventually nothing is absorbed .",
    "reflections at normal incidence can be reduced by impedance matching the slab with vacuum ( equal relative permittivity and permeability , @xmath0 ) ( see , for example  @xcite ) . in contrast here",
    "we look to have low reflection for graded non - magnetic media for all angles of incidence where the dissipation is large and confined to a region of space on the order of the wavelength of incident radiation .",
    "another means to achieve perfect absorption is by using coherent perfect absorbers ( cpas ) or anti - lasers  @xcite . here",
    "waves are incident from opposite sides onto a lossy medium whose phase difference is such that the corresponding outgoing ( or reflected ) waves are eliminated through destructive interference , thus ensuring that all the waves energy ends up in the medium .",
    "alternatively , thin layers of hyperbolic metamaterials have been shown to be perfectly absorbing to transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarised radiation in a relatively small frequency band  @xcite .",
    "also metamaterials consisting of unit cells with two metallic resonators can be impedance matched to yield low reflection and high absorption in a small frequency band close to normal incidence  @xcite .",
    "indeed metamaterials with gradually changing properties are one route to producing graded index media  @xcite .",
    "such metamaterial perfect absorbers ( mpas ) need not however be polarisation sensitive  @xcite .",
    "a more comprehensive discussion of mpas may be found in the review article  @xcite . in this work",
    "we explore a new way to determine distributions of dissipation in order to find media that do not reflect and totally absorb incident radiation .",
    "consider the situation of a monochromatic wave of frequency @xmath1 incident on a linear isotropic material whose permittivity varies only along one direction , as shown in figure  [ figure0 ] .",
    "is incident from the negative @xmath2 axis upon a material whose permittivity may be described by @xmath3 and is spatially homogeneous along the @xmath4 direction . in general it is expected that the incident wave will split into three parts : a reflected wave a transmitted wave and a part absorbed into the medium.[figure0 ] ]    the electric field @xmath5 corresponding to a te polarised plane wave propagating in the @xmath6-plane through a material uniform in the @xmath4 direction with permittivity @xmath3 and unit permeability satisfies the helmholtz equation @xmath7\\varphi(x)=0.\\label{1}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 and @xmath9 determines the angle of incidence of the wave . in what follows",
    "it is assumed without loss of generality that @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "considering the situation of a medium sitting in free space , it is natural to split the permittivity up into its background value and the electric susceptibility @xmath11 containing the inhomogeneous part @xmath12 .",
    "previous work has shown that specifying properties of the permittivity in the complex position plane @xmath13 allows control of the reflection and transmission characteristics of a graded planar medium .",
    "specifically graded index media whose susceptibility satisfies the spatial kramers - kronig relations @xmath14 are reflectionless to waves incident from the left @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "such a condition corresponds to the permittivity being an analytic function of position @xmath16 in the upper half complex position plane ( @xmath17 ) , and decaying to @xmath18 as @xmath19 in this half plane .",
    "the media we will be considering will decay as o@xmath20 or slower as @xmath21 and the usual definition for the reflection and transmission coefficients for such extended profiles based on the incident , reflected and transmitted plane waves is not well defined due to the reliance on a reference point , as pointed out by longhi  @xcite , although reflectionlessness is still well - defined  @xcite .",
    "the moduli of the reflection and transmission coefficients can be defined unambiguously using the corresponding wkb waves  @xcite @xmath22 for spatial kramers - kronig media the transmission coefficient can be calculated as an integral in the upper half complex position plane @xmath23 where the contour @xmath24 goes from @xmath25 to @xmath15 along a path above any branch cuts of @xmath26  @xcite and this is valid for all angles and both left - to - right and right - to - left propagation ( although there will be reflections from the right in general ) .",
    "now consider a subset of the class of spatial kramers - kronig media : permittivity profiles containing a finite number of poles in the lower half position plane : @xmath27 integrating around a large semi - circle @xmath24 in the upper half plane contributes half a residue from each of the simple poles leading to a transmission coefficient  @xcite @xmath28 it is therefore clear how to make graded index permittivity profiles having any desired transmission coefficient between 0 and 1 by tuning the residues of simple poles in @xmath29 .",
    "however , it is not clear how to make the transmission coefficient negligible without taking the limit of one of the simple pole residues going to @xmath30 ( and hence the imaginary part of the permittivity to @xmath31 ) . in the rest of this work ,",
    "we explore how to make the transmission coefficient negligible whilst keeping the permittivity bounded .",
    "high absorption has been achieved experimentally by a metamaterial having a profile of the form ( [ 4 ] ) where the number of poles @xmath32 is finite  @xcite . however , for these spatial kramers - kronig media , to make the transmission coefficient completely vanish and have all of the incident wave absorbed , it follows from ( [ 5 ] ) that we require a profile where the sum of the residues is infinite @xmath33 this requires an infinite number of simple poles in the lower half plane . for the series defining the permittivity ( [ 4 ] ) to converge , and hence for @xmath29 to be everywhere bounded , the sum @xmath34 must converge .",
    "in particular , there can not be an infinite number of poles in a compact space of the complex plane whilst still satisfying condition ( [ 6 ] ) and yielding a convergent permittivity ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , there must be poles extending infinitely far out in the lower half complex plane . in going from ( [ 3 ] ) to ( [ 5 ] ) for the transmission through a permittivity profile given by ( [ 4 ] ) , it was assumed that the number of poles , @xmath32 , is finite .",
    "however , it is not obvious that this holds in the limit @xmath35 i.e. when there are an infinite number of poles , because an interchange of limits is required : the limit as the radius of the contour @xmath24 in ( [ 4 ] ) tends to infinity must be swapped with the infinite summation(s ) in ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "fortunately , with an application of lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem  @xcite , it can be shown that the transmission coefficient must vanish when the condition ( [ 6 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the effect of having such an infinite sum of residues is to slow down the decay rate of the permittivity as @xmath21 . in particular , in the absence of any singularities in the permittivity @xmath3 along the real axis @xmath36 , and any gain in the material ( i.e. the permittivity has non - negative imaginary part ) , it is the speed of decay of the profile that determines whether the transmission coefficient is zero , unity or somewhere in between .",
    "this leads to the following classification : @xmath37",
    "as an example of this , consider taking @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are positive constants .",
    "this corresponds to the profile @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the digamma function ( the logarithmic derivative of the @xmath44 function ) and @xmath45 is euler s constant .",
    "having constructed this function from an infinite number of simple poles , note that asymptotically @xmath46 so here it is the weaker ln@xmath47 decay which leads to a profile with zero transmission . since all terms beyond the second term do not affect the transmission ( see ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) ) , for simplicity consider the profile obtained by neglecting the o@xmath20 part of ( [ 9 ] ) and displacing the remaining singularity to the lower half plane ( which merely causes an o@xmath20 alteration in the profile ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are positive constants .",
    "this preserves the required property of being analytic in the upper half complex position plane , therefore satisfying the spatial kramers - kronig relations .",
    "wave propagaion through such a material is simulated in figure  [ figure1 ]    , truncated at @xmath51 .",
    "( ii ) the transmission coefficient on a logarithmic scale of a plane wave propagating in either direction through the medium as a function of incidence angle . ( iii ) and ( iv ) the reflection coefficient for left and right incidence , respectively , as a function of incidence angle . ( v ) and ( vi ) wave propagation simulated in comsol multiphysics  @xcite by placing an out - of - plane line source to the ( ii ) left and ( iii ) right of the medium and the time - average of the absolute value of the electric field is plotted .",
    "reflection and transmission is suppressed for a left incident wave whereas just the transmission is suppressed for a right incident wave.[figure1 ] ]    where the material has been spatially truncated on either side at @xmath52 .",
    "the region where there is significant dissipation is relatively small so we can consider these slabs as effectively thick coatings of non - absorbing material that supress the reflection from the thin region of large dissipation .",
    "this allows for spatial truncation of the profile without affecting the reflectionlessness of the material . approaching grazing incidence",
    "the reflection becomes significant since imperfections in the truncation of the profile are magnified .",
    "note that , perhaps surprisingly , as @xmath53 , the imaginary part decays as o@xmath20 in this example ( as opposed to o@xmath54 $ ] ) , so from the lossy part of the medium one might expect a transmission coefficient akin to that of a simple pole i.e. between 0 and 1 .",
    "however , it is the interplay between the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity that not only combines to give zero reflection , but also the zero transmission property .    as an example of a slightly different behaviour of decay for the permittivity which still gives zero reflection and transmission ,",
    "consider taking @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are positive .",
    "this corresponds to the permittivity @xmath57 following the same process of neglecting the o@xmath20 part of the expansion leads to the simpler permittivity profile ( again with the singularity displaced to the lower half plane to preserve analyticity in the upper half plane ) : @xmath58 where @xmath50 and @xmath49 are positive constants . in this case",
    "the decay is again slower than o@xmath20 ; in this case it is o@xmath59 .",
    "this is plotted in figure  [ figure2 ] , ( again truncated to @xmath60 ) .    , truncated at @xmath51 .",
    "( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) the transmission , left incidence reflection and right incidence reflection coefficient of a plane wave propagating as a function of incidence angle .",
    "( v ) and ( vi ) wave propagation simulated by placing an out - of - plane line source to the ( ii ) left and ( iii ) right of the medium and the time - average of the absolute value of the electric field is plotted .",
    "reflection and transmission is suppressed for a left incident wave.[figure2 ] ]    much of the behaviour for this example is similar to the previous example .",
    "however , in this case , it is noticeable that the reflection is also low for a right incident wave .",
    "reflections from general bumps in graded index profiles are difficult to quantify a priori , though this example may open the possibility of suppressing transmission and reflection from both sides of the medium .",
    "we have used the method of design developed in previous work  @xcite to examine permittivity profiles satisfying the spatial kramers - kronig relations where the transmission and reflection are zero .",
    "the earlier work has explained why reflection vanishes for kramers - kronig media but hasnt considered how the transmission can additionally be removed .",
    "the decay of the profiles can be classified into three types on the basis of the transmission properties , ( faster than @xmath61 , full transmission ; as @xmath61 , partial transmission ; slower than @xmath61 , zero transmission ) .",
    "a typical graded index absorber has a permittivity with an imaginary part increasing slowly in space .",
    "we have designed perfectly absorbing permittivity profiles , localised to a central region of the profile , which decay to zero at infinity , but are constructed from sums of poles with infinite net residues .",
    "they have negligible transmission for all angles of incidence and negligible reflection away from grazing incidence .",
    "the findings were numerically verified for a finite slab of material using comsol multiphysics  @xcite .",
