    "<S> current - voltage characteristics and dynamic conductance of the superconductor - constriction - superconductor junctions in gdo(f)feas polycrystalline samples with critical temperatures @xmath0k were investigated . </S>",

    "<S> temperature dependence of the large gap @xmath6 indicates the presence of intrinsic proximity effect ( in @xmath7space ) between two superconducting condensates .    </S>",
    "<S> novel fe - based superconductors @xcite are now in the focus of intensive experimental research . </S>",
    "<S> some of their features such as layered crystal structure and spatial separation of superconducting layers are similar to those of cuprates and mgb@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the stoichiometric 1111-family compounds were shown to be antiferromagnetic metals with spin density wave ( sdw ) ground state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> partial oxygen deficiency or fluorine substitution for oxygen induces superconductivity in the fe - as layers . </S>",
    "<S> rare - earth elements replacement also affects the critical temperature @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath5 for gd-1111 oxypnictides can be lowered by replacement of y for gd @xcite or increased by introducing th instead of gd @xcite . the @xmath9k reported in gd@xmath10th@xmath11feas compound is today the highest one for fe - based superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> band - structure calculations showed the total density of states @xmath12 at the fermi level to be formed mainly by fe @xmath13-states @xcite . a large fe - isotope effect @xcite and the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath12 for different iron - based superconductors @xcite give support to the phonon - mediated coupling in these compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretically calculated fermi surface for 1111-system compounds @xcite comprises cylinder - like hole sheets centered at the @xmath14 point and quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron sheets at the @xmath15 point of the reduced brillouin zone .    </S>",
    "<S> here we present the superconducting gap measurements in gdo(f)feas by andreev spectroscopy of scs - contacts ( superconductor - constriction - superconductor ) using a `` break - junction '' technique .    </S>",
    "<S> nearly optimally doped gd-1111 samples were prepared by high pressure synthesis described in detail in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting properties of the samples were tested by measuring temperature dependences of the ac - magnetic susceptibility and resistance @xmath16 . both showed a sharp superconducting transition at @xmath17k ( the bulk value of the critical temperature was defined at the maximum of @xmath18-curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two sets of polycrystalline gdo(f)feas samples were studied : `` el''-series ( gdo@xmath19f@xmath20feas , @xmath21k ) and `` kh''-series ( gdo@xmath22f@xmath23feas , @xmath24k ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows typical temperature dependences of resistance for kh - series samples .    in order to determine superconducting gap values for gdo(f)feas , we used ( i ) andreev spectroscopy @xcite of individual sharvin - type @xcite scs - contacts and ( ii ) intrinsic andreev spectroscopy ( intrinsic multiple andreev reflections effect ( imare ) @xcite , which usually exists due to the presence of steps and terraces at clean cryogenic clefts ) . </S>",
    "<S> scs - andreev nanocontacts in polycrystalline samples were prepared by the `` break - junction '' technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the samples of the typical size @xmath25mm@xmath26 were attached to the flexible sample holder with two current and two potential leads by in - ga alloy that is liquid at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the holder with the sample was cooled down to 4.2k , then a microcrack in the sample was generated by precise bending the sample holder .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting nano - contact is a mechanical contact of two clean cryogenically cleaved surfaces separated by a constriction ; this geometry excludes impurity presence at the cryogenic clefts . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27- , @xmath28-characteristics of the contact were measured using a standard ac - modulation technique @xcite .    according to the theory by kmmel _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the sns ( superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ) andreev - type contact , the main features of its current - voltage characteristics ( cvc ) are the excess current at low bias voltages and the subharmonic gap structure ( sgs ) . the latter shows series of dynamic conductance dips at bias voltages    @xmath29    due to the multiple andreev reflections effect . for a multigap superconductor , several independent sgss corresponding to each gap should be observed . </S>",
    "<S> the cvcs studied in this work are typical for the clean classical sns - contact ( with a constriction acting as a normal metal ) with excess - current at low bias voltage , therefore , we believe , the theoretical model by kmmel _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is applicable to our break - junctions . strictly speaking , </S>",
    "<S> the sharpest sgs are intrinsic of andreev contacts of the highest quality with a small diameter @xmath30 which is less than the quasiparticles mean free path @xmath31 ( i.e. , in the ballistic limit ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case one may observe a large number of gap peculiarities , thus facilitating the gap energy measurements . in the case @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> , only few sgs minima would contribute to the dynamic conductance spectra , which in most cases corresponds to the studied gdo(f)feas scs - contacts .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33-curves for the single - junction scs - contact el1d6 ( lower yellow line ) and 2-junctions kh3d4 array ( normalized to a single junction ; upper red line ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath3k . </S>",
    "<S> sgs dips defining @xmath34mev and @xmath35mev are marked with @xmath36 and @xmath37 labels , respectively . ]    in the framework of the `` break - junction '' technique and due to the layered structure of gdo(f)feas , the so - called stacks of andreev contacts may be formed on cryogenic clefts ; this type of junctions , the @xmath38-array , enables one to observe imare similar to that observed earlier in bi-2201 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for such an array , bias voltage for any peculiarities caused by the bulk properties at @xmath28-characteristic scales with number of sequentially connected contacts @xmath39 as compared with the single junction case . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , this is not the case for such cvc features that originate from any defects influence on the cleaved surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> one can determine @xmath39 by collating dynamic conductance spectra of andreev arrays with different number of junctions in a stack and normalizing them to a single contact characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the array contacts are a factor of @xmath39 less sensitive to surface defects ( which otherwise would seriously affect the properties of superconductor @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by making cvc measurements on the stack contacts , one can determine the _ true bulk gap _ values much more accurately .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows dynamic conductance of two scs - andreev contacts : single junction el3d1 , lower black line , and an array kh3d4 , upper gray line . after normalizing the @xmath28-characteristic of the array ( @xmath40 for this case ) to that for the single junction , </S>",
    "<S> we achieve a good coincidence of the spectra peculiarities . </S>",
    "<S> such a procedure was done for all scs - arrays , with @xmath39 as a fitting parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized dynamic conductance shows a set of dips at bias voltages @xmath41mv and 11mv ( marked by dashed vertical lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum at @xmath42mv is seen only at the kh3d4-curve ( marked by arrows ) for stack contact . </S>",
    "<S> these three peculiarities may be associated with the sgs minima @xmath43 , which leads to the estimated local value of the large superconducting gap @xmath34mev . </S>",
    "<S> the minima at @xmath44mv at the el1d6-curve ( marked by solid vertical lines ) do nt correspond to the expected bias voltage @xmath42mv for the 3rd harmonic @xmath45 of the large gap , and , hence , indicates the presence of the small gap @xmath35mev . </S>",
    "<S> the satellite minima above the @xmath46 dips may originate from excitation of leggett collective modes and require additional studies .    for some contacts ( such as el3 sample , single scs - andreev junction # d1 ) </S>",
    "<S> , one can see the sgs originating from the small gap , but not only a single peculiarity . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows such series comprising @xmath47 at @xmath48mv ( vertical dashed lines ) . using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) , we directly find the small superconducting gap value @xmath49mev . the additional fine structure seen in fig.3 at @xmath50mv </S>",
    "<S> may be caused by the @xmath51 order parameter anisotropy and is subject of further studies . as the small gap sgs </S>",
    "<S> is located near zero bias voltages , it becomes smeared by the dramatic increasing of the dynamic conductance at the di / dv - curve . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the background subtraction or taking the second derivative of the cvc helps one to distinguish the small gap peculiarities , as was done to the spectrum at the fig.3 .     </S>",
    "<S> normalized to a single junction sgs bias voltages @xmath52 , @xmath53 versus @xmath54 for several scs - contacts ( @xmath55 ) investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines indicate the averaged gap values @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath58 . ]     normalized to a single junction sgs bias voltages @xmath52 , @xmath53 versus @xmath54 for several scs - contacts ( @xmath55 ) investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines indicate the averaged gap values @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath58 . ]    by a precise mechanical readjusting of the contact , we were able to observe characteristics of several scs break - junctions within the same low - temperature experiment ; the independent local gap measurements improve the statistics of the results . to get values of @xmath59 and their scatter , in accordance with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) , we plotted sgs minima positions @xmath60 as a function of their inverse number @xmath54 ; this line should start at the @xmath61 point . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental data measured at @xmath3k are summarized on figure 4 that shows the results for three samples with a similar @xmath62 ( kh3d4 contact - down triangles , el1d6 - squares , el3d1 - rhombs , el3d2 - circles , and el3d13 - up triangles ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the data agree with each other and confirm the presence of the two distinct superconducting gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged gap values obtained at @xmath3k @xcite are :    @xmath63mev , @xmath64mev    for the critical temperatures @xmath65k . </S>",
    "<S> the close agreement of the data for various samples shows the reproducibility of the measured gaps magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> imare spectroscopy technique also facilitates measurements of temperature dependence of the superconducting gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the subharmonic gap structure of the dynamic conductance of symmetrical sns - contacts remains rather well - pronounced up to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , to define the gap value no additional fitting is required @xcite : at any temperatures up to @xmath5 the gap @xmath66 can be obtained straightforward using the expression ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note , that in case of alternative technique of the andreev spectroscopy of sn - junctions , and for a two - gap superconductor , one needs to fit the resulting conductance curves using 7 fitting parameters .     </S>",
    "<S> temperature dependence of the large gap @xmath6 ( circles ) plotted under the data of figure 5 . </S>",

    "<S> figure 5 shows the dynamic conductance of scs - array ( sample kh3 , contact # d4 , see fig.2 ) measured in the range @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are shifted vertically for clarity . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiarities are washed out at @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the `` local '' critical temperature is referred to as the temperature of the transition to the normal state in the contact area ( with diameter @xmath70 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthy to note that the @xmath71 can differ from the @xmath62 , the averaged characteristic measured by non - local methods . </S>",
    "<S> the coincidence of the local @xmath71 and the averaged @xmath62 may be observed only in the ideal clean and homogeneous sample . by taking the @xmath72mev value ( see fig.2 ) and @xmath73k from figure 5 , for the kh3d4 array we obtain an estimate for the bcs ratio , @xmath74 ; the ratio would however be reduced to 4.8 if we use the averaged @xmath75k value , as in refs . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the former value 5.5 is close to that for lao@xmath76f@xmath77feas ( a lower-@xmath5 analogue of gd-1111 ) @xcite . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the measured @xmath78-ratio exceeds the standard single - gap bcs value 3.52 for the weak coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> presumably , the @xmath79 value suggests the strong coupling in the condensates with a large gap value . as for the small gap , </S>",
    "<S> our data leads to @xmath80 which is less than the bcs value  3.52 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of the large gap @xmath6 obtained from our imare measurements ( see fig.5 ) within the range @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> similar measurements of the temperature dependence for the small gap represent a harder task , possibly require higher quality of samples , and have not been accomplished yet . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 dependence lies noticeably below the standard single - gap bcs - like curve ( dash - dotted line in figure6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the temperature smearing ( see error bars plotted for the last data point ) allows to resolve the gap value up to @xmath8244.5  k. the deviation in the @xmath6 dependence could not be attributed to surface gap influence ( i.e. , it is not due to the real space proximity effect ) , because it is obtained from andreev reflection measurements in the _ array _ contact , where the surface effects are reduced . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath83 energy coincides with the value for the single scs - contacts ( see fig.2,4 ) . were the real - space proximity effect </S>",
    "<S> be responsible for the deviation , the @xmath83 would differ ; our experiment , however , shows this is not the case . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior resembles the @xmath84-dependence for mgb@xmath8 @xcite and @xmath6 for fese @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical studies @xcite explain such a deviation by interband coupling effect . by analogy </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that similar deviation for gd-1111 may arise from nonzero interband coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced bcs - ratio for the small gap also supports this conclusion and suggests that the `` weak '' superconductivity in the low gap condensate may be induced by @xmath85-space ( internal ) proximity effect between two superconducting condensates @xcite . according to refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the observed shape of the @xmath86 curve ( see figure 6 ) is typical for the `` driving '' condensate in the presence of the second ( driven ) condensate with a small gap .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the large superconducting gap ( @xmath87 ) in the 1111-family compounds with critical temperatures 40k @xmath88k was confirmed by tunneling spectroscopy ( `` break - junction '' technique ) @xcite , point - contact andreev reflection ( pcar ) spectroscopy of sn - junctions @xcite , and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , there are no other data available for gd-1111 to compare with . </S>",
    "<S> thus , comparing our results for gdo(f)feas with the aforementioned data on other 1111-superconductors , we find rather good agreement with @xmath79 values determined by `` break - junction '' technique @xcite and in some pcar - measurements @xcite .    in conclusion , we studied the dynamic conductance of scs - contacts in gdo@xmath89f@xmath90feas ( @xmath91 ) polycrystalline samples ( @xmath92k ) by scs andreev spectroscopy , in the temperature range 4.2k @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> we detected two superconducting gaps , the large @xmath94mev , and the small @xmath2mev . </S>",
    "<S> the observed temperature dependence of the large gap @xmath6 suggests the existence of @xmath85-space proximity effect between two superconducting condensates and , therefore , nonzero interband interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated @xmath4 ratio exceeds the bcs limit 3.52 and indicates the strong coupling regime in the `` driving '' condensate .    </S>",
