    "events have long been considered to be a useful probe of partonic energy loss in nuclear collisions.@xcite to first approximation  is well represented by the lo qcd compton scattering process @xmath2 . due to the dominance of this process",
    "the  cross - section should provide a constraint on the gluon distribution function in elementary particle collisions.@xcite in central nuclear collisions at rhic energies the hard - scattered parton may lose energy as it traverses the nuclear medium but the photon will not . in principle , jet energy loss measurements should constrain the parameter @xmath3 which which controls the strength of the energy loss .",
    "although di - jet events occur at a much higher rate than  events , the initial energy of the outgoing partons is hard to determine , complicating their interpretation . in the case of prompt photons arising from the compton process",

    "hence we include photons from jet fragmentation , which are allowed at nlo .",
    "typically the latter are removed by isolation requirements , but such cuts are difficult to apply in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "baseline measurements for fragmentation photons are necessary as the parton @xmath4 photon fragmentation functions are not well constrained . although the energy loss mechanism should suppress production of these photons in central collisions , additional photon bremsstrahlung may be induced by the presence of the strong color fields , which would be an interesting energy loss observable in its own right .",
