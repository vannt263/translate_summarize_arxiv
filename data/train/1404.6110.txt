    "plasma accelerators utilize the breakdown medium `` plasmas '' as the accelerating structures and therefore avoid the further material breakdown limit posed by the conventional accelerating structures , e.g. copper or niobium rf cavities . in principle",
    ", the wavebreaking field can reach 100@xmath0gv / m for a plasma with density of @xmath1 .",
    "plasmas are therefore the ideal medium to sustain a very large electric field for particle beam acceleration .",
    "plasma based accelerators have achieved tremendous progress in recent decades @xcite . with the advances in laser technology , especially with the introduction of the chirped pulse amplification ( cpa ) @xcite , the cutting edge laser facility nowadays",
    "can routinely reach a few hundred terawatts ( @xmath2watts ) or even petawatts ( @xmath3watts ) peak power with very short pulse length ( e.g. , tens of femtoseconds ) .",
    "employing such a laser pulse as drive beam , laser wakefield accelerators ( lwfa ) can achieve @xmath4gev level electron beam within a few centimeter plasma channel and with an energy spread of only a few percent @xcite .",
    "this scheme therefore has enormous potential for use in future compact light source @xcite or particle colliders @xcite . for the electron beam driven plasma wakefield accelerator ( pwfa ) ,",
    "the experiments conducted by a group of scientists from ucla / usc / slac collaboration at the fftb at slac , have successfully demonstrated energy doubling for the slc @xmath5gev electron beam @xcite .",
    "the resulting accelerating gradient in this experiment is about three orders of magnitude higher than the accelerating field of the slc linac @xcite .",
    "compared to the intrinsic limitations posed by lwfa scheme ( e.g. depletion , diffraction and dephasing ) , the relativistic charged particle beam can in principle propagate in a plasma for a long distance due to large beam beta function ( beta function of the beam is equivalent to the rayleigh length of a laser beam ) .",
    "therefore the beam driven pwfa has already attracted worldwide interests .",
    "it can potentially accelerate a particle beam to high energy due to its high accelerating gradient and relatively long acceleration length . in this paper",
    "we propose a new research facility pars ( plasma accelerator research station ) for studying plasma wakefield acceleration at the clara facility based at daresbury laboratory .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , the clara facility and the design strategy for the pars beam line are introduced .",
    "section 3 elaborates on the electron beam tracking results through the clara / pars beam line .",
    "the beam parameter settings at the clara / pars are given in section 4 .",
    "the detailed particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation results on plasma wakefields driven by the electron beams at various plasma densities are presented in section 5 .",
    "section 6 discusses some other research topics ( issues ) , which can be investigated at the pars beam line as well .",
    "the aim of clara is to develop a normal conducting test accelerator able to generate longitudinally and transversely bright electron bunches and to use these bunches in the experimental production of stable , synchronized , ultrashort photon pulses of coherent light from a single pass fel ( free electron laser ) with techniques directly applicable to the future generation of light source facilities @xcite .",
    "the clara facility houses a photo - injector electron gun , normal conducting accelerating cavities , magnetic bunch compressor , fourth harmonic lineariser , dedicated beam diagnostic sections at low and high energies and fel beam line , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : clara_pars_layout ] .",
    "the beam energy is 250@xmath0mev and the maximum bunch charge is about 250@xmath0pc .",
    "the achievable bunch parameters in different operating modes are listed in table 1 @xcite .",
    "for the electron beam driven pwfa experiment at pars , a dogleg will guide the full energy clara beam to a parallel beam line , offset by @xmath41.5 m from the clara beam axis , contained within the clara shielding area .",
    "the conceptual layout of the pars beam line is also shown in fig . [",
    "fig : clara_pars_layout ] .",
    "it consists of the dogleg beam line , final focus , plasma cell , energy spectrometer ( phosphor screen ) and final beam dump ( not shown ) .",
    "the dogleg beam line consists of arrays of dipoles and quadrupoles to guide and focus the beam from the clara beam line to the pars . the final focus , which is prior to the plasma cell ,",
    "is designed to focus the electron beam transversely and to match the electron beam with the plasma . a variable 10 - 50 cm plasma cell ( a dc discharge plasma source seems feasible )",
    "will be built to test the key issues in the pwfa experiments at various beam and plasma parameter ranges .",
    "an energy spectrometer , together with a phosphor screen is employed to characterize the energy of electrons exiting the plasma cell .",
    "the final beam dump will absorb the energy of electrons after exiting the plasma cell .",

    ", the bunch can be compressed to an ultrashort pulse which is crucial to a high plasma wakefield excitation . using the typical clara beam parameters ,",
    "e.g. a bunch length of 75@xmath12 m , a bunch charge of 250@xmath0pc and an energy spread of  1% , we track a gaussian beam through the pars beam line using elegant @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emitt_pars ] .",
    "the beam emittance growth ( about 1% ) is negligible before it reaches the plasma cell .",
    "it shall be noted that the small emittance change is mainly due to the csr effects .",
    "to qualify the tracking simulations performed using a gaussian bunch profile , full start - to - end simulations were performed from the electron source to the end of the pars final focus line , using an astra+elegant computational framework .",
    "baseline clara design introduces the vela photo - injector where a ti - sapphire laser ( 266@xmath0 nm ) illuminates a copper cathode with 76@xmath0fs pulses ( 1mj energy per pulse ) at a repetition rate of 10@xmath0hz .",
    "the cathode is followed by a 2.5 cell , s - band , normal conducting cavity with an accelerating gradient of 100@xmath0mv / m @xcite .",
    "consequently , the beam is generated at the cathode using the astra code @xcite , and the generated beam is tracked through the gun using full space charge tracking up to the first clara linac where it reaches an energy of 6.5@xmath0mev .",
    "there are two envisaged operating modes of clara .",
    "the first mode is a long-pulse mode , where the beam is accelerated at some relatively small off - crest phase in the first linac , and which is magnetically compressed in the down - stream bunch compressor ; and the second mode is an ultra - short-pulse mode where the beam is velocity - bunched ( vb ) in the first linac , and no magnetic compression is performed .",
    "the magnetic compression scheme is designed to operate at up to 250@xmath0pc . whereas the velocity bunched mode is limited to bunch charges of 100@xmath0pc .    to investigate the limits of achievable bunch lengths for the pars experiment , initial",
    "work has focused on the second option , the velocity - bunched scheme , as this is expected to produce the shortest bunches from clara . for this scheme to work",
    "the beam must pass through the first linac around the zero - crossing phase of the rf waveform , that is @xmath490@xmath10 from the crest . at this phase the head of the bunch",
    "is decelerated , whilst the tail is accelerated , which , due to the low energies involved , leads to a velocity - time correlation over the bunch . over a subsequent drift distance , up to the entrance of linac 2 ,",
    "the head and the tail of the bunch compress due to the velocity correlation and the bunch can reach peak currents of over 2@xmath0ka at 100@xmath0pc bunch charge . the beam is accelerated in linac 2 up to 75@xmath0mev , which limits the growth in bunch properties , primarily due to space - charge forces , in the rest of the machine .",
    "this section of the machine is also tracked in astra with full space - charge forces included , however the wakefields in linacs are not included .",
    "the output of the astra simulations are then passed to the elegant code , which includes longitudinal space - charge forces as well as a 1-d model of csr .",
    "representative wake - field models for all rf cavities after linac 2 are also included in elegant .",
    "the beam is tracked through the diagnostics and bunch - compression ( switched off in this scenario ) sections of the clara machine before being further accelerated in linacs 3 and 4 up to the design energy of 250@xmath0mev .",
    "due to the high - density longitudinal structure of the electron bunch , space - charge forces are still important at the intermediate energies , and this leads to a broadening of the electron bunch longitudinally , which reduces the peak currents at the exit of linac 4 to approximately 600@xmath0a for a 100@xmath0pc bunch .",
    "tuning of the exact rf phases in linacs 1 and 2 can mitigate some of this reduction , but maximum peak currents are always less than 1@xmath0ka at 100@xmath0pc .",
    "the vb mode produces a slight longitudinal chirp in the electron bunch which , due to the very short bunch lengths , is not significantly modified by the off - crest phases in linacs 2 - 4 .",
    "this natural chirp leads to a longitudinal bunch shortening in the pars beam line , due to the inherent @xmath11 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : matrix_ele_pars ] .",
    "this @xmath11 can be used to increase the peak current at the pars final focus system to over 3@xmath0ka at 100@xmath0pc .",
    "csr effects can also be seen in the bunch , but due to the @xmath9 phase advance designed into the system , they do not strongly affect the longitudinal bunch properties .",
    "the fully longitudinally compressed bunch is then transversely focused in the final - focus system to produce transverse beam dimensions of the order of 20@xmath12 m .",
    "transverse focusing at higher bunch charges is significantly harder than at lower charges due to the csr effects that are seen .",
    "the transverse beam properties are also affected by space - charge in the long transport from the exit of linac 2 till the entrance of linac 3 .",
    "the current elegant model does not include transverse space - charge forces , but initial estimates using astra do show an increase in the transverse emittance by a factor of 3 .",
    "the effects of transverse space - charge will be more fully characterised at a later date , and the current resultstherefore represent an idealised case .",
    "the results of these simulations are demonstrated , for a 100@xmath0pc clara bunch . in fig .",
    "[ fig : linac2_long ] we show the beam current and momentum distribution at the exit of linac 2 , where the electron beam has been velocity bunched in linac 1 , and then accelerated approximately on - crest in linac 2 .",
    "this also corresponds to the beam distribution at the end of the astra tracking run , and thus the input for elegant .    in this simulation",
    "we have set linac 1 at a phase of 91.5@xmath10 , slightly off from the nominal zero - crossing phase , and linac 2 at an off - crest phase of + 4@xmath10 .",
    "this acts to limit the velocity bunching and gives peak currents of @xmath41@xmath0ka at the exit of linac 2 , compared to the @xmath132@xmath0ka that are possible , for a 100 pc bunch .",
    "this reduced peak current at the exit of linac 2 has been shown to increase the achievable peak currents seen at the end of the pars beamline by up to 2@xmath0ka , by both reducing the effects of space - charge forces in the long transport system up to linacs 3 and 4 , and increasing the longitudinal chirp on the bunch .",
    "figure [ fig : linac4_long ] shows the same bunch at the exit of linac 4 , with an energy of 250@xmath0mev . here",
    ", the peak current has been reduced to only @xmath4500@xmath0a due to the broadening effects of longitudinal space - charge forces .",
    "the natural chirp on the bunch is now much more clearly defined , and this will lead to a longitudinal bunch compression in the pars beamline .",
    "there are also 2 clear tails on the bunch distribution at the head and tail of the bunch .",
    "these tails arise within from the electron source , and it does not seem possible to mitigate those using solely electro - magnetic means in the beamline . the final longitudinal bunch properties at the exit of the pars line are shown in fig .",

    "the non - linear reduction in peak current with reducing charge is mostly due to mitigation of the space - charge broadening in the clara beamline at reduced bunch charges .",
    "there is also some reduction in the csr effects in the pars beamline itself , although this is less important for the final longitudinal bunch length . due to the bunch tails that arise from the electron source",
    ", there is a broad background of charge in the longitudinal bunch distribution .",
    "this limits the total charge in the current spike to , at worst , 50@xmath15 of the main bunch charge .    in all three cases",
    "the bunch length for the current spike is shorter than 30@xmath0fs rms . at the exit of the pars beamline",
    ", the bunch has to be focused transversely as well as longitudinally .",
    "figure [ fig : pars_spot_end ] shows the transverse bunch properties for the three different charge values shown above .",
    "it can be seen that for a low bunch charge the transverse beam size falls to about 20@xmath12 m rms size .",
    "however , for high charge regimes , 50@xmath0pc and 100@xmath0pc , there is some broadening of the bunch transverse size due to the increased energy spread of the beam , arising due to csr effects in the pars beamline .",
    "note , however , that the increase in transverse emittance due to space - charge forces has not yet been fully characterised , and these numbers are expected to increase .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ] [ tab : beam_specs ]",
    "according to the linear theory of pwfa @xcite , the maximum plasma wakefield amplitude is proportional to the bunch charge ( number of electrons per bunch ) and inversely proportional to the square of the bunch length .",
    "therefore a short drive beam is in principle preferable for a high amplitude wakefield excitation .",
    "a preliminary simulation study has shown that an accelerating gradient of a few gv / m can be obtained if a short ( therefore high peak current ) electron bunch is used as drive beam at the pars .",

    "three operating regimes , i.e , long pulse , short pulse and ultra - short pulse can be achieved at clara facility for the pwfa experimental research @xcite .",
    "to gain a full understanding of the wakefield excitation by using the relativistic clara beam as drive beam , one has to rely on detailed simulations .",
