    "<S> inset : the enlargement around the zero energy.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    now let us figure out how does this pair of majoranas evolve in the chain with an odd number of sites . in the adiabatic approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the system remains in the instantaneous eigenstate of the hamiltonian , and we can obtain the pair of majoranas as , @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the linear combinations of the majorana operators @xmath84 and @xmath85(see supplementary material  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can find that @xmath86 assembles around the domain wall at the position @xmath78 , while @xmath87 distributes around the two ends . </S>",
    "<S> when the domain wall transports , the evolution of the two majoranas is exactly described by the formula eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) . to show clearly this process , we present the numerical results of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ braiding1 ] a ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown , when the domain wall is near the left end two majoranas distribute around the two ends , respectively . with the transport of the domain wall , </S>",
    "<S> the majorana @xmath88 carried by the domain wall moves along the chain . at the meantime , </S>",
    "<S> the spectral weight of the majorana @xmath89 transfers gradually to the left end . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath88 arrives at the right end , @xmath89 completely transfers to the left end . </S>",
    "<S> however , to complete the braiding , we finally need to do a gauge transformation which transforms the kramers doublet @xmath90 into @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> it results in , @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the states after the gauge transformation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we realize the braiding of two majoranas : @xmath94 . in this process , </S>",
    "<S> the two majoranas avoid a catastrophic encounter magically , so we realize the braiding in the strictly 1d geometry , i.e. , in a spin chain . </S>",
    "<S> this surprised result can be understood if we look at the process in the channel of majoranas , as shown pictorially in fig.3(b - d ) . because there are two species of majoranas @xmath95 , in fact what the majoranas @xmath96 ( a linear combination of @xmath95 ) see is two parallel chains . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the absence of the coupling between different species @xmath95 on the same sites and the presence of the coupling of the same species between the nearest - neighbors @xmath97 or @xmath98 in our model ( see fig .  [ braiding1 ] e ) ) might be essential for the braiding in this geometric 1d spin chain .    in our solution </S>",
    "<S> , we find one exception that , when @xmath99 , the four bound states are all majorana fermions and the braiding will break down(see the supplementary materials for detail ) . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that a simple protocol that permits adiabatic exchange of two majorana fermions in 1d superconductor wire has been proposed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange of two majorana fermions relies on a domain wall in the superconducting order parameter which hosts a pair of ancillary majoranas .    </S>",
    "<S> a ) the distribution of the wavefunctions of two majorana fermions(the red and the blue lines ) on the 1d spin chain with 59 lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> the green dashed line indicates the winding number , so the step indicates the position of the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> b)-d)illustrate the physical picture of the exchanging process of two majoranas @xmath100 in the geometrical 1d spin chain . </S>",
    "<S> e)pictorial representation of the couplings between majorana fermions as described by the hamiltonian eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq9]).,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    _ speculation and discussion_to get the exactly solvable 1d spin model @xmath47 , we have introduced the @xmath10 gauge fields @xmath101 to kramers doublet . </S>",
    "<S> these gauge fields can be implemented by a rotation operation @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the @xmath104 component of the effective orbital angular momentum and @xmath105 is the @xmath104 component of the total angular momentum of the spin and orbital . in this way , we have @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath107 is the rotation operator acting on the orbital space , which is supposed to rotate the crystal field inversely . </S>",
    "<S> it could be realized by rotating the oxygen octahedron of transition metal compounds along the @xmath104-axis in solids . on the other hand , @xmath108 , </S>",
    "<S> a rotation operator acting on the whole space , is difficult to realize because we are not able to rotate a spin . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this operation can be replaced by employing an external magnetic field which amounts to introduce a dynamical phase into @xmath109 , with @xmath110  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> admittedly , the rotation operations and the implementation to create the domain wall by shifting the active orbital are in fact difficult to realize in solids . however , thanks to the recent rapid developments on the quantum simulation by using a well - controlled quantum system to simulate complex quantum matter , we propose to realize this scheme either in cold atom systems  @xcite or in quantum simulators consists of superconducting circuits  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to discuss the possible effect of the heisenberg term if it has not been eliminated . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> an additional term which will enter the hamiltonian @xmath47 is @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the ground state is still kramers doubly degenerate if the lattice site @xmath68 is odd because of its time - reversal symmetry @xmath112 . according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the ground state of a class of interacting majorana fermion models is always doubly degenerate if @xmath68 is odd which is related by a particle - hole operation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is interesting to generalize this conclusion to our system when the term @xmath111 is added , and to investigate if its kramers doubly degeneracy is related to a pair of majorana zero modes .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary_in conclusion , we derive an exactly solvable one - dimensional spin model from the three - orbital hubbard model with a strong spin - orbit coupling by projecting it onto the isospin states with @xmath10 gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> it has a topological nontrivial phase characterized by majorana end modes which are protected by a new @xmath1 topological invariant related to the parity of the lattice sites ( odd or even number of sites ) . with the protection of this new topological invariant @xmath113 </S>",
    "<S> , we realize the braiding of two majoranas in this strictly geometric one - dimensional spin chain .    </S>",
