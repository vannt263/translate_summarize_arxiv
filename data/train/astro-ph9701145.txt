    "@xmath0  orionis  c ( hd  37022=hr  1895 ) is the central star of the trapezium cluster and the principal source of ultraviolet photons illuminating the orion nebula ( m  42 ) . @xmath0",
    "ori  c also illuminates the population of proplyds in its vicinity ( odell & wen 1994 ) , providing some of the most direct evidence yet for circumstellar disks around low - mass pre - main  sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "it is classified as o7  v ( conti & leep 1974 ) but is spectroscopically variable ( conti 1972 ; walborn 1981 ) .",
    "conti & alschuler ( 1971 ) and conti ( 1972 ) also found variable inverse p cygni emission profiles in the  @xmath3 line .",
    "recently , stahl et al . (",
    "1993 ) discovered that the long - known h@xmath2 and  @xmath3 emission variations on @xmath0  ori  c exhibit a strict , stable 15.4-day periodicity , presumably the rotation period of the star .",
    "they suggested that @xmath0  ori  c may be an oblique magnetic rotator akin to magnetic chemically peculiar b stars like the he - strong star @xmath4  ori  e ( b2  vpe ) where the emission lines are likely to be formed in the magnetosphere above the magnetic equator ( shore & brown 1990 ) .",
    "walborn & nichols ( 1994 ) and stahl .",
    "et al . ( 1996 ) subsequently found @xmath5 absorption variations at high velocities that are consistent with the h@xmath2 period and concluded that @xmath0  ori  c possesses a corotating wind .",
    "the absorption strength is minimum when the h@xmath2 and  @xmath3 emission is maximum , i.e. , when the wind in our line of sight is weakest . from the phase difference between the optical emission and the uv absorption - line strength , stahl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) infer a rotational inclination @xmath6 and a magnetic obliquity @xmath7 .",
    "x - ray variability of @xmath0  ori  c was first reported by ku , righini - cohen , & simon ( 1982 ) based on _ einstein _",
    "hri observations of the trapezium .",
    "three deep _ rosat _ hri exposures obtained in 1991 october , 1992 march , and 1992 september show that @xmath0  ori  c varied from 0.29 to 0.45 counts  s@xmath1 . when folded with the ephemeris of stahl et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , the high and low x - ray count rates corresponded to phases of maximum and minimum h@xmath2 emission , respectively ( caillault , gagn , & stauffer 1994 ) .",
    "during the period 1995 september 121 , the _ rosat _ hri ( cf .",
    "david et al . 1996 ) obtained 10 observations of the trapezium each separated by approximately two days and each consisting of two satellite orbits . a light curve for @xmath0  ori  c was generated by summing counts within a @xmath8 ( 90% power ) radius circle centered on the emission peak , subtracting a local background , and dividing the net counts by the dead - time corrected exposure time for each orbit .",
    "the source region dimensions were chosen to exclude essentially all counts from other trapezium sources . in figure  1 , we plot the hri light curve of @xmath0  ori  c. images of individual orbits revealed that for 7 of the 20 orbits , the standard processing software was unable to generate an adequate aspect solution . consequently , point sources in these 7 images appear to be smeared along the se  nw axis .",
    "for these orbits , source counts were extracted from an ellipse with major and minor axes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , and position angles ranging from @xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "these points are indicated in fig .",
    "1 with crosses .    in fig .  1 , the upper axis indicates the corresponding phase using the ephemeris of stahl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , where @xmath13  d , @xmath14 , and phase 0.0 correspond to maximum h@xmath2 emission . also plotted are the 1991 oct 2 , 1992 mar 22 , and 1992 sep 14 count rates and phases ( open circles ) .",
    "fitting a simple sine curve to the x - ray count rates with a period of 15.422  d yields a low - state count rate of 0.26  counts  s@xmath1 and an amplitude of 0.15  counts  s@xmath1 .",
    "the fit is plotted in fig .",
    "1 . leaving the period as a free parameter , we find a period of @xmath15  days ( @xmath16 error ) .",
    "the soft x - ray emission appears to vary in phase with the h@xmath2 emission and with a very similar period .",
    "based on the optical extinction estimates of breger , gehrz , & hackwell ( 1981 ) , the interstellar column density in the @xmath0  ori  c line of sight is likely to be @xmath17  @xmath18 . assuming a distance of 440  pc , the 0.12.0  kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath0  ori  c at phase @xmath19 is @xmath20  ergs  s@xmath1 ( corrected for interstellar absorption ) .",
    "if we assume no major changes in the spectral shape at x - ray maximum , the 0.15  counts  s@xmath1 hri variability amplitude corresponds to @xmath21  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "we discuss the x - ray variability in the context of five different models : ( 1 )  colliding - wind emission with an unseen lower - mass companion , ( 2 )  coronal emission from an unseen lower - mass companion , ( 3 )  periodic density variations , ( 4 )  absorption of magnetospheric x - rays in a corotating wind , and ( 5 )  magnetosphere eclipses .",
    "for the first two scenarios , we assume that @xmath0  ori  c has an unseen pms companion . while there is no compelling evidence that @xmath0  ori  c is a binary , many high - mass stars in the trapezium are spectroscopic binaries ( abt , wang , & cardona 1991 ) .",
    "stahl et al . (",
    "1996 ) did find that a number of @xmath0  ori  c s photospheric lines show irregular @xmath22  km  s@xmath1 radial - velocity variations , suggesting an upper limit to the companion s mass @xmath23 , assuming an o star mass @xmath24 ( howarth & prinja 1989 ) .",
    "if 15.4  d is the orbital period , then a lower limit for the binary separation is @xmath25 . in colliding - wind models ,",
    "the x - rays arise in a shock region where the wind of a hot , massive star collides with either the wind or the outer atmosphere of the companion .",
    "we calculate the expected x - ray emission from @xmath0  ori  c via this mechanism by comparing it to the well - studied example of @xmath26  velorum , a wolf - rayet binary ( o9  i + wc8 ) in which the wr secondary possesses a very massive wind with @xmath27  yr@xmath1 and @xmath28  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "willis , schild , & stevens ( 1995 ) predict @xmath29  ergs  s@xmath1 resulting from the @xmath26  vel colliding - wind shock region .",
    "in the case of @xmath0  ori  c , the wind is variable and published values of the terminal wind speed are discordant .",
    "prinja , barlow , & howarth ( 1990 ) used the narrow absorption component in the profile and estimated @xmath30  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "walborn & nichols ( 1994 ) identified a broad , variable , high - velocity component in the profile and determined @xmath31  km  s@xmath1 . in order to maximize the effect of colliding winds ,",
    "we assume @xmath32  yr@xmath1 and @xmath33  km  s@xmath1 for @xmath0  ori  c ; in the most optimistic case , the t tauri companion might have @xmath32  yr@xmath1 ( levreault 1988 ) and @xmath34  km  s@xmath1 ( natta , giovanardi , & palla 1988 ) . using these wind parameters in eq .",
    "( 10 ) of stevens , blondin , & pollock ( 1992 ) , we find that the maximum expected x - ray luminosity of @xmath0  ori  c from colliding winds would be comparable to that observed on @xmath26  vel .",
    "although the wind parameters have been chosen to maximize colliding - wind emission , the predicted @xmath35 falls short of the observed x - ray variability amplitude by a factor of three .",
    "moreover , the collision of such slow winds may not produce sufficient shocks to heat the interaction region to @xmath36  mk .",
    "if instead we use @xmath31  km  s@xmath1 for the terminal wind speed of @xmath0  ori  c , the predicted x - ray luminosity is a factor of at least 25 lower because of the lower wind density in the interaction region . in this case , the sharp peak at phase 0.0 predicted by the model of willis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is inconsistent with the smoothly varying sinusoidal x - ray emission observed on @xmath0  ori  c. also , colliding winds can not account for the smooth variation with phase of the equivalent width of the absorption line observed by walborn & nichols ( 1994 ) and stahl et al .",
    "it should be noted that the stevens et al .",
    "( 1992 ) model assumes spherically symmetric mass loss while mass loss from t tauri stars is often collimated in bipolar jets ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "it is also unclear how long a massive accretion disk ( which drives mass loss in t tauri stars ) might survive in close proximity to an o7  v star .",
    "while there are many complicating factors one could include in the colliding - wind scenario , we think it unlikely that these complications would significantly improve the agreement between the model and the observations .",
    "next , we consider coronal x - ray emission from an unseen , pms companion whose coronal x - ray emission is being eclipsed by the o - star or severely attenuated by the o - star wind at the 15.422  d orbital period . since the amplitude of the hri variations corresponds to @xmath21  ergs  s@xmath1 , this must be a lower limit to the companion s x - ray luminosity .",
    "since the most x - ray luminous low - mass star in the entire orion region , p1817 , has @xmath37  ergs  s@xmath1 ( gagn , caillault , & stauffer 1995 ) , it is unlikely that a low - mass star can account for the observed variations .",
    "moreover , as has been pointed out by stahl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , a low - mass companion can not account for the luminosity of the h@xmath2 and @xmath3 variations .",
    "given the the small - amplitude radial - velocity variations , a more massive companion ( e.g. , an o or early - b star ) could exist if the binary orbit were in the plane of the sky ( @xmath38 ) ; but , in this case , we do not expect significant x - ray variability .      to our knowledge",
    ", @xmath39  puppis ( o4  i(n)f ) is the only other candidate o - type magnetic rotator .",
    "moffat & michaud ( 1981 ) report periodic h@xmath2 variations and propose a rotational period of 5.075  d for @xmath39  pup .",
    "berghfer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) report 6% variations in the 0.92.0  kev _ rosat _ pspc flux and a @xmath40 peak in the x - ray power spectrum near 16.7  hr .",
    "contemporaneous h@xmath2 spectra show profile variations consistent with the moffat & michaud ( 1981 ) period of 5.075  d. the residual profile variations also indicate a weak peak in the h@xmath2 emission power spectrum near the x - ray period of 16.7  hr .",
    "berghfer et al .",
    "interpret the x - ray ",
    "h@xmath2 correlation as evidence for periodic density fluctuations at the base of the wind .",
    "interestingly , the pspc time series does not indicate any variability at the 5.1-d rotation period . nonetheless , the periodic h@xmath2 and ultraviolet variations and the possible presence of correlated x - ray  h@xmath2 emission in @xmath39  pup and @xmath0  ori",
    "c is noteworthy .",
    "berghfer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) interpret the 16.7  hr period as pulsations or cyclically repeating azimuthal structures .",
    "they suggest that either of these will produce periodic density variations at the photosphere which propagate through the wind , producing enhanced h@xmath2 , and x - ray emission seen from different characteristic heights in the wind .",
    "berghfer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) propose that the emissions have the same apparent phase because the phase shift between the x - ray and h@xmath2 emission regions is , fortuitously , @xmath41 . in the case of @xmath0  ori  c ,",
    "the sound crossing time through the wind is short ( @xmath42  d out to @xmath43 ) compared to the 15.4-d period of @xmath0  ori  c. consequently , a density wave resulting from non - radial pulsations might lead to apparently coherent variations . however , the lowest non - radial pulsation modes for main - sequence o stars have periods in the range 0.52.0  d ( baade 1986 ) , much shorter than the observed 15.4  d period .      for the next two scenarios ,",
    "we assume that the 15.422  d periodicity is the rotational period of a single o star .",
    "the periodic and profile variations seen by walborn & nichols ( 1994 ) and stahl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) appear to require a non - spherically symmetric , corotating wind .",
    "the tremendous torque required to maintain a corotating wind also suggests an extended magnetic field geometry . as has been pointed out by stahl et al . and",
    "walborn & nichols , the , h@xmath2 , and variations on @xmath0  ori  c are reminiscent of the oblique magnetic rotator @xmath4  ori  e ( b2  vpe ) . on @xmath4",
    "ori  e , mass loss occurs preferentially along open magnetic field lines over the magnetic poles , while , at lower magnetic latitudes , field lines close inside the alfvn radius , funneling wind material towards the magnetic equator .",
    "bolton ( 1994 ) suggests that the region of closed magnetic field lines ( the magnetosphere ) extends out to @xmath44 .",
    "if phases of maximum mass loss on @xmath0  ori  c correspond to phases of maximum absorption , then we expect one magnetic pole to pass our line of sight around phase 0.5 .",
    "( stahl et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we suggest that most of @xmath0  ori  c s x - ray emission is produced in the magnetosphere of an oblique magnetic rotator .",
    "although o - star x - rays are generally interpreted as emission from shock regions distributed throughout the wind ( e.g. , owocki , castor , & rybicki 1988 ) , x - ray emission from @xmath0  ori  c is not typical of most single , main - sequence o  stars .",
    "first , @xmath0  ori  c is the only known o star with large - amplitude , periodic x - ray variability .",
    "second , @xmath0  ori  c s peak x - ray activity level , @xmath45 , is higher ( by a factor of five ) than any other single o star detected in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( berghfer , schmitt , & cassinelli 1996 ) .",
    "third , the _ asca _ sis spectrum of the trapezium ( yamauchi et al . 1996 ) indicates very high temperature plasma with @xmath46  mk .",
    "although the sis can not spatially resolve @xmath0  ori  c from surrounding lower - mass stars , the hri images and the pspc low - resolution spectra suggest that some of the high - temperature emission must be associated with @xmath0  ori  c. conventional o - star shock models do not predict sufficiently fast shocks to produce such hot plasma . on the other hand , magnetically confined plasma ( e.g , in coronal loops on the sun and other late - type stars )",
    "can be heated to very high temperatures .    assuming that x - rays from the magnetosphere are being absorbed in the wind , x - ray variability would arise from varying wind absorption .",
    "the amount of excess absorbing material can be inferred from the excess equivalent width at high velocities around phase 0.5 , @xmath47    ( walborn & nichols 1994 ) . assuming that the absorbing material is optically thin in , we find a lower limit to the excess column density @xmath48  @xmath18 .",
    "howarth & prinja ( 1989 ) determine @xmath49  @xmath18 from the p cygni profile at low velocities .",
    "if the wind and the absorbing region have approximately the same abundance and ionization , then 2530% of the column density measured at phase 0.5 comes from the overlying absorption region .",
    "since the high - velocity absorption is not observed at phase 0.0 , can this column density difference account for the observed x - ray variability amplitude ?    in order to estimate the x - ray spectral shape of @xmath0  ori  c",
    ", we have analyzed the _",
    "pspc spectrum of the trapezium obtained in 1991 march over 4  d spanning phases 0.360.63 , i.e. , near @xmath0  ori  c x - ray minimum .",
    "we have simulated _ rosat _ hri count rates at phases 0.0 and 0.5 in xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) by fitting the pspc spectrum obtained near phase 0.5 and varying the column density in the overlying absorption region .",
    "the fit parameters are not well constrained , but the simulations suggest that a @xmath50 decrease in the wind column density would result in a @xmath51 increase in the hri count rate from phase 0.5 to 0.0 .",
    "more detailed modeling of spatially resolved x - ray spectra is required , but our preliminary estimates suggest that absorption in the overlying , corotating wind of an oblique magnetic rotator may be a viable mechanism for the observed x - ray variability .      on an o - type magnetic rotator , x - ray variability might result from eclipses of the magnetosphere and/or from varying absorption in the overlying , corotating wind . if the magnetosphere on @xmath0  ori  c extends out to many stellar radii like it does on @xmath4  ori  e and if @xmath6 , then the x - ray variations are not likely to arise from eclipses .",
    "however , if the magnetosphere were closer to the stellar surface ( i.e. , 12  @xmath52 ) , then eclipses could produce smooth x - ray variations .",
    "this scenario can be tested with x - ray spectra obtained at opposite phases .",
    "if the x - ray spectra do not indicate any appreciable change in the absorbing column density from x - ray minimum to x - ray maximum , then the variability is most likely due to eclipses .",
    "the first two scenarios , which require the presence of an unseen binary companion , probably can not account for the smooth , large - amplitude x - ray variations seen on @xmath0  ori  c. furthermore , there is little evidence that @xmath0  ori  c is a binary : the photospheric lines only show small , irregular radial - velocity variations ( stahl et al .",
    "such variability is characteristic of atmospheres of luminous o stars and is not strong evidence for a companion ( bieging , abbott , & churchwell 1989 ) .",
    "the period of the x - ray and h@xmath2 emission is not compatible with non - radial pulsations causing density fluctuations in the o star wind .",
    "the phase , period , and variability amplitude of the x - ray emission on @xmath0  ori  c do appear to be consistent with either of the last two scenarios .",
    "like stahl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we , too , conclude that the 15-d period is the rotation period of the o star and that most of the observed variable emission and absorption phenomena can be explained if @xmath0  ori  c is an oblique magnetic rotator .",
    "nonetheless , a few outstanding questions remain .    first , and most importantly",
    ", it would be useful to measure the longitudinal magnetic field strength as a function of phase . establishing the existence and location of one or more magnetic poles on @xmath0",
    "ori  c would represent the first definitive detection of magnetic fields on any o star .",
    "a surface magnetic field of a few hundred gauss may be sufficient to produce wind corotation out to 10 stellar radii .",
    "however , such a small field may be difficult to detect because it would produce zeeman shifts of only a few m  compared to a polarized line width of @xmath41    ( otmar stahl , private communication ) .",
    "alternatively , the hanle effect can be used to detect polarization differences in the @xmath5 resonance lines for massive stars whose longitudinal @xmath53-field is less than 1  kg .",
    "the hanle effect refers to a change in the polarization of resonantly scattered photons as a result of larmor precession of the scattering electron in a magnetic field ( see cassinelli & ignace 1996 ) .",
    "second , @xmath54  km  s@xmath1 , as measured from photospheric @xmath55 line profiles , is too high .",
    "if the 15.4  d period is the rotation period of the star , then @xmath56 must be less than @xmath57  km  s@xmath1 , assuming @xmath58 ( howarth & prinja 1989 ) .",
    "non - rotational broadening mechanisms , which have not been taken into account in the @xmath56 determination of stahl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , may explain some of the discrepancy .",
    "possible broadening mechanisms include : stronger stark broadening due to higher gravity or atypically large macroturbulence , related to the peculiar optical line - profile variations .",
    "we note , however , that most main - sequence o stars show little evidence of macroturbulence ( ebbets 1979 ) and classical doppler broadening measurements are generally adequate for determining @xmath56 in slowly rotating early - type stars like @xmath0  ori  c ( collins & truax 1995 ) .",
    "finally , modeling of magnetospheric x - ray emission with non - spherically symmetric wind geometries is essential .",
    "upcoming observations of the trapezium with _ asca _ at opposite phases of @xmath0  ori  c may help distinguish between the two competing hypotheses for the x - ray variability observed by _",
    "rosat_. because of source confusion in the trapezium , though , a conclusive test may only be possible with the _ axaf _ ccd imaging spectrometer .",
    "mg would like to thank steve skinner , jeff valenti , peter conti , and otmar stahl for useful discussions about x - rays , magnetic fields , and o stars .",
    "the authors wish to thank an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions .",

    "<S> we consider five mechanisms which might explain the amplitude , phase , and periodicity of the x - ray variations : ( 1 )  colliding - wind emission with an unseen binary companion , ( 2 )  coronal emission from an unseen late - type pre - main  sequence star , ( 3 )  periodic density fluctuations , ( 4 )  absorption of magnetospheric x - rays in a corotating wind , and ( 5 )  magnetosphere eclipses . </S>",
