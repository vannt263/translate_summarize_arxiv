    "the determination of the galaxy distribution in clusters provides information on the status and the history of these structures through the study of their dynamics .",
    "detailed studies spanning the entire range of morphologies of rich clusters of galaxies are important for understanding the formation and evolution of these systems . in a class of current cosmological models ( e.g. cold dark",
    "matter dominated ) , rich clusters are formed hierarchically , by accretion of smaller subunits .    several clusters are indeed known to present very lumpy morphologies ( see e.g. kriessler & beers 1997 and references therein ) revealing that these systems are in a merging process",
    ". the best studied examples are a2256 ( briel , henry & bhringer 1992 ) , where a small group is detected in the x - ray band nearby the cluster center , and coma , where a number of substructures are revealed ( biviano et al .",
    "1996 ) . among the most spectacular cases",
    "are the encounters between clusters of similar richness , as for the a3558 complex ( bardelli et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 , 1998a , 1998b ) , where the dynamical processes reach unusual intensities , or the cluster a3528 , which is actually split into two merging x - ray emitting regions of similar properties ( schindler 1996 ) .",
    "the study of merging clusters is important because this process is thought to be responsible for a wide number of properties of the cluster galaxy population .",
    "radio halos and relicts of radiosources are found in clusters that visually present some degree of disturbance ( feretti & giovannini 1996 ) and burns et al .",
    "( 1994 ) explained as a consequence of a merging event the presence of post - starburst galaxies in the large scale x ",
    "ray emitting filament connecting coma with the ngc4839 group .    a good starting point to individuate merging cluster candidates",
    "is that to extract close pairs from supercluster catalogues , as f.i . the list of zucca et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which reports groups of aco clusters ( abell , corwin & olowin 1989 ) as a function of the density contrast . in this catalogue , the cluster pairs individuated by a density excess @xmath4 are very close systems , where often the nuclei are separated by less than one abell radius ( @xmath5 h@xmath3 mpc , hereafter h = h@xmath6/100 ) : one of these pairs",
    "is formed by a548 and a3367 .",
    "the centers of the two clusters in the aco catalog are separated on the plane of the sky by 77 arcmin , corresponding to @xmath7 h@xmath3 mpc at the distance of a548 .",
    "the separation in velocity was less clear : in fact the cluster a548 is reported to have a mean velocity of @xmath8 km / s ( determined on 133 redshifts , davis et al .",
    "1995 ) , while a3367 had reported a value of @xmath9 km / s ( based on 6 velocities , postman , huchra & geller 1992 ) . however , postman & lauer ( 1995 ) reported a velocity of @xmath10 km / s for the brightest member of a3367 , clearly inconsistent with the above mean value .",
    "the cluster a548 [ @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is a cluster of richness class 1 and bautz - morgan type iii .",
    "this cluster has been extensively studied both in the optical and x  ray wavelength .",
    "davis et al . ( 1995 ) reported a global velocity dispersion of @xmath13 km / s , but this cluster appears dynamically very complex .",
    "from the analysis of a mosaic of rosat pspc observations , davis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found the presence of three extended sources ( dubbed s1 , s2 and s3 ) with luminosities in the range @xmath14 erg / s in the @xmath15 $ ] kev band . performing a substructure analysis of the optical sample",
    ", they detected three subcondensations : two of these groups ( labelled as @xmath16 and @xmath17 in their table 4b ) correspond to the extended x  ray emissions s1 and s2 respectively ( see their table 2 ) .",
    "these optical subclumps were already found by escalera et al .",
    "( 1994 ) with the use of a wavelet decomposition analysis .",
    "they described a548 as a binary cluster , when large spatial scales are considered .",
    "moreover , they detected at smaller scales a central subgroup .",
    "these three components can be identified with the @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath17 substructures of davis et al ( 1995 ) , respectively .",
    "another indication of the complex dynamical situation of this cluster appears from the different behaviour of galaxies with and without emission lines in their spectra : biviano et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in their analysis of the enacs survey ( katgert et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) found a significant offset between the mean velocities of these two types of objects .    on the contrary ,",
    "the cluster a3367 was little studied so far .",
    "it has coordinates @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , is of richness class 0 and is classified as a bautz - morgan type i - ii .",
    "no other relevant date was found in the literature apart the mean velocity reported above .",
    "for these reasons we decided to concentrate our redshift survey on a3367 and on the region between a3367 and a548 , and in this paper we present a sample of 180 new radial velocities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we present the sample and the data reduction , in sect .",
    "3 we discuss the dynamical properties of the three peaks found in the sample and finally in sect .",
    "4 we summarize our results .",
    "the starting photometric catalogue is the cosmos / ukst galaxy catalogue of the southern sky ( yentis et al .",
    "1992 ) , obtained from automated scans of ukstj plates by the cosmos machine .",
    "we extracted a circular region of @xmath21 diameter , centered on @xmath22 and @xmath23 , containing @xmath24 objects to the limiting magnitude @xmath25 .",
    "[ fig : iso]a shows the isodensity contours obtained binning the data in 2 @xmath26 2 arcmin cells and smoothing with a gaussian of 6 arcmin of fwhm .",
    "for the two clusters circles of one abell radius have been drawn around their nominal center . note",
    "that it is already evident that a548 is not a smooth cluster with a single central nucleus , but presents multiple condensations . inside the abell circle of a3367 we note a single condensation shifted northward with respect to the nominal center . in fig .",

    "the optopus multifiber spectrograph is formed by a bundle of 50 optical fibres at the cassegrain focal plane of the telescope ; this field has a diameter of 32 arcmin , and each fibre has a projected size on the sky of 2.5 arcsec .",
    "we used the eso grating @xmath3715 with 300 lines / mm and a blaze angle of 4@xmath3818@xmath39 .",
    "this grating allows a dispersion of 174  / mm in our wavelength range ( 37006100 )  .",

    "four of the 50 fibres were dedicated to sky measurements , leaving 46 fibres available for the objects .    fields f51a , f51b , f52 and f53 were observed for 1 hour , split into two half - hour exposures in order minimize the presence of cosmic hits .",
    "fields f61 and f62 were observed only for 1/2 hour .",
    "the observing sequence was a 30-s exposure of a quartz halogen white lamp , a 60-s exposure of helium vapour lamp for fields f61 and f62 , or 60-s exposure of helium + neon vapour lamp for fields f51 , f52 and f53 ; then the scientific field , and again the arc and the white lamp .",
    "the extraction of the one - dimensional spectra was performed using the apextract package as implemented in iraf .",
    "positions and tracing solutions of lamps and objects were determined on the flat field exposures .",
    "the procedure we adopted to estimate the relative transmission of each fibre is based on the fitting of a gaussian profile to the [ oi]@xmath435577 sky line in each spectrum and on computing the continuum - subtracted flux of this line ( bardelli et al .",
    "if we assume that the flux and the shape of the spectrum of the night sky remain constant in the telescope field , this value is the same in each spectrum apart from the transmission of the fiber , which is a multiplicative factor . after having normalized the spectra",
    ", we can subtract the ` mean sky ' obtained as the average of the 4 sky spectra .",
    "we have obtained a total of 276 spectra : 45 were not useful for redshift determination ( @xmath44 of the total ) , because of poor signal  to  noise ratio or badly connected fibers , and 51 turned out to be stars ( @xmath45 of the reliable spectra ) , leaving us with 180 galaxy redshifts .",
    "the galaxies whose spectrum presents detectable emission lines are 79 , corresponding to a percentage of @xmath46 of the total .",
    "the radial velocities of galaxies with spectra with absorption lines have been determined using the program xcsao in the iraf task rvsao ( kurtz et al .",
    "1992 ) , which is based on the cross - correlation method of tonry & davis ( 1979 ) .",
    "the determination of redshift is done by fitting a parabola to the main peak of the cross - correlation function .",
    "sixteen different templates ( eight stars and eight galaxies ) were used for the determination of the radial velocities , choosing as better estimate the one which gave the minimum cross - correlation error , defined as :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the fwhm of the cross - correlation peak and @xmath49 is the ratio between the height of the correlation peak and the @xmath50 of the antisymmetric part of the correlation function ( kurtz et al .",
    "1992 ) .    to estimate the redshift of spectra with strong emission lines we used the emsao program in the iraf task rvsao .",

    "1994 ) .    in order to check the zero point precision of our velocity scale , we considered the histogram of the measured velocities of the stars misclassified as galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : star ] ) , which are expected to have a zero mean velocity . considering only the 41 spectra with the higher signal - to - noise ratio",

    "however , we can not exclude that the value of @xmath66 is completely due to bulk motions of stars in this region of the sky .",
    "very recently , cappi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , analysing the esp survey ( vettolani et al . 1997 , 1998 ) , noted a systematic difference between the velocities estimated from the emission lines and the cross - correlation for the same galaxy , with an average difference of @xmath67 km / s ( obtained from more than 700 galaxies ) .",
    "our observations are taken in the same instrumental configuration of the esp survey and can give an independent estimate of this effect , although with a smaller sample .",
    "on the basis of 10 galaxies , we find @xmath68 km / s , consistent within the errors with the result of cappi et al .",
    "in fig . [ fig : ist1]a the histogram of the galaxy velocities is shown .",
    "it is clear the presence of at least three peaks ( labelled as a , b , c in the figure ) : the first is at a velocity of @xmath69 km / s , the second and the third at @xmath70 km / s and @xmath71 km / s , respectively .",
    "peak a is at the same velocity of a548 and presents a clear bimodality .",
    "although no significant differences ( through a k - s test ) are found between the overall distributions of galaxies with and without emission lines , a more detailed analysis of the three peaks reveals that the two distributions inside the single peaks are in fact different ( see fig.[fig : ist1]b ) . in particular , for peak",
    "a it is evident a separation in velocity , being the population of emission line objects dominant in the clump at lower velocity : the percentage of emission line galaxies with respect to the total in this clump is @xmath72 , while it is @xmath73 in the higher velocity clump . because galaxies with and without emission lines have different luminosity functions ( zucca et al .",
    "1997 ) , it could be suspected that their different distribution is a consequence of a change in the relative values of their selection functions : however , the width of peak a is relatively narrow ( less than @xmath74 km / s ) and therefore this effect is more likely due to a real variation in morphological composition in the two subclumps .",
    "we estimated the dynamical parameters ( mean velocity and velocity dispersion ) of the three peaks with the biweight estimators of location and scale ( beers et al .",
    "the advantage of these estimators , with respect to the standard mean and dispersion , is that of minimizing biases from interlopers , giving less weight to data with higher distance from the median .",
    "the confidence intervals of the two estimators are calculated boostrapping the data with 100 random catalogs . in order to find the velocity range in which the cluster members lie , we have assumed that the velocity distribution of cluster galaxies is gaussian , as expected when the system has undergone a violent relaxation ( see details in bardelli et al .",
    "1994 ) .    for the case of peak",
    "a , in which the presence of a substructure was suspected on the basis of both a visual inspection of the velocity histogram and the shape estimators @xmath16 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see bird & beers 1993 ) , we checked if the distribution is consistent with a single gaussian or it is bimodal applying the kmm test ( ashman et al . 1994 ) , using the program kindly provided by the authors .",

    "<S> in this paper we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in an area between the two clusters of galaxies a548 and a3367 , suspected to be a close and interacting pair . with the use of multifiber spectroscopy , we measured 180 new velocities of galaxies in the central part of a3367 and in the external regions of a548 .    </S>",
    "<S> the redshift histogram shows the presence of three velocity peaks , at @xmath0 km / s , @xmath1 km / s and @xmath2 km / s , respectively . for these </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the density excess , the mean velocity , and the velocity dispersion .    </S>",
    "<S> the first clump corresponds to an elongation of a548 : in particular we found a correspondence between the features of this peak and the substructures of a548 . </S>",
    "<S> the second peak has a velocity dispersion which is typical of clusters and the distribution of its members on the plane of the sky corresponds to the highest density peak in a3367 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore suggest that the name a3367 has to be attributed to this clump .    </S>",
    "<S> our general conclusion is that , differently from expected , a548 and a3367 do not form a close pair of merging clusters , since the two structures are at significantly different redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we found that the complex dynamical structure of a548 has large coherence , with a projected extension in the range of 1 - 3 h@xmath3 mpc . </S>"
