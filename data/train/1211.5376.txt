    "understanding how dark matter is distributed in low - mass galaxies is central to the study of galaxy formation in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm .",
    "the first cdm simulations predicted that all dark matter halos share a universal density profile with a cuspy inner slope of @xmath4 ( @xcite , hereafter ) .",
    "when observers began studying low - mass galaxies , however , they mostly found halos with a uniform density @xmath5 core @xcite .",
    "this disagreement between theorists and observers over the form of @xmath6 became known as the core / cusp debate .",
    "since the debate began , the number of profile parameterizations used to describe low - mass galaxies by both theorists and observers has only increased .",
    "observers champion empirical fits such as the burkert profile @xcite , cored isothermal models @xcite or simply generic broken power laws @xcite .",
    "theorists have also introduced new fits to their simulated halos with varying , although still cuspy , inner slopes @xcite . modeling a galaxy with each of these parameterizations",
    "would not only be time consuming , but also biased if the true profile is unlike any of them .",
    "it is therefore preferable to use non - parametric methods to determine @xmath7 .",
    "van den bosch et al . ( 2006 ) first experimented with non - parametric orbit - based models by allowing the mass - to - light ratio @xmath8 to vary with radius in the globular cluster m15 .",
    "we introduce a similar modeling technique that uses axisymmetric schwarzschild modeling , combined with knowledge of the full line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) of stars , to break the well - known degeneracy between mass and orbital anisotropy .",
    "we demonstrate the capability of these models by applying them to the local group dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy draco .",
    "draco is part of an interesting class of objects that are some of the most dark matter - dominated galaxies discovered .",
    "this makes differentiating between dark and luminous mass in dsphs easier as the baryons have less of an effect on the total density profile than they do in larger galaxies .",
    "recently , using improved data and modeling techniques , @xcite found a cuspy dark matter profile in the low - mass galaxy ngc  2796 where previous studies found a core .",
    "studies like these motivate us to investigate the dsphs with more sophisticated models .",
    "our models represent a significant improvement over previous work on dsphs as most studies use spherical jeans models @xcite which require the modeler to make assumptions about the nature and degree of the anisotropy .",
    "these assumptions vary in complexity from simply assuming isotropy , which can bias the estimate of @xmath9 @xcite , to parameterizing the anisotropy as a general function of radius @xcite .",
    "models that allow for more freedom in the anisotropy typically fall victim to the mass - anisotropy degeneracy and can not robustly determine the inner slope of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we hope to make a robust determination of the inner slope in draco with a suite of more general non - parametric schwarzschild models .",
    "at the heart of our non - parametric technique is the orbit - based modeling code developed by @xcite , updated by @xcite , and described in detail in @xcite .",
    "all orbit - based codes are based on the principle of orbit superposition first introduced by @xcite .",
    "similar axisymmetric codes are used by @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite while @xcite present a fully triaxial modeling code .",
    "the current schwarzschild models that allow for dark matter do so by requiring the modeler to assume a parameterization for the dark matter density profile @xmath7 . unfortunately , this parameterization is often exactly what we wish to determine .",
    "current methods get around the circular logic of this dilemma by running models with different parameterizations and comparing their relative goodness - of - fit with a @xmath10 test .",
    "non - parametric modeling sidesteps the issue entirely , and lets the parameterization of @xmath7 be output from the models , rather than input as a guess .",
    "the principle of orbit superposition works by choosing from a library of all possible stellar orbits only those orbits that best reproduce the observed kinematics of the galaxy being modeled .",
    "if we know the mass density profile of the galaxy , and hence the potential , we can compute the appropriate orbit library .",
    "however , since we do not know the potential of the galaxy , we must construct a number of models with slightly different mass distributions and compare the goodness - of - fit of the resulting allowed orbits .",
    "the radial profile of the total ( dark + stellar ) mass density in a galaxy can be written as :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the mass - to - light ratio of the stars , @xmath13 is the stellar luminosity density profile , and @xmath7 is the dark matter density profile . in principle we know @xmath12 , which can vary as a function of radius , from stellar population models .",
    "we also know @xmath13 from the de - projection of the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "our task is to construct orbit libraries for varying @xmath14 and match the allowed orbits to kinematics in the form of losvds  the distribution of projected velocities observed .",
    "some orbit libraries will contain orbits that do a good job at fitting the observed losvds and others will not .",
    "the best - fitting model identifies the best - fitting @xmath14 .",
    "once we know this , we can invert equation ( [ param ] ) to solve for @xmath7 .",
    "the trick is to vary @xmath14 in a systematic way .",
    "this is the principal difference between our new approach and standard schwarzschild modeling which tries to vary @xmath14 by varying the parameters that define an assumed dark matter profile .    to compute the orbit library for each model ,",
    "we first calculate the potential .",
    "we assume axisymmetry and make use of the stellar ellipticity to define the density at angle @xmath15 in our meridional grid .",
    "the dark matter halo is assumed to have the same ellipticity as the stars .",
    "we solve poisson s equation for the potential associated with this density distribution by decomposing @xmath16 into spherical harmonics @xcite . with",
    "the potential known , we launch 20,000 - 30,000 orbits and integrate their motion for roughly 100 crossing times , storing position and velocity information at each timestep .",
    "orbits in axisymmetric potentials respect three isolating integrals of motion : energy @xmath17 , the @xmath18-component of angular momentum @xmath19 , and the non - classical third integral @xmath20 . by specifying all three of these quantities together",
    ", an orbit is uniquely defined .",
    "unfortunately , there is no analytical form for @xmath20 and it is generally not known a priori .",
    "we therefore rely on the sampling scheme of @xcite to construct an orbit library which uniformly samples @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and thereby contains all possible orbits for a given potential .",
    "each orbit in the library is given a weight @xmath21 , and a set of @xmath21 are chosen so the observed kinematics are appropriately reproduced by the orbits which have been weighted , averaged , and projected .",
    "quantitatively , we observe @xmath22 losvds in the galaxy at various positions .",
    "each losvd contains @xmath23 velocity bins with uncertainties , so the number of observables the models must match to is given by the product @xmath24 .",
    "the goodness - of - fit of a model is judged by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the @xmath28 velocity bin of the @xmath29 losvd from the observations and model respectively , and @xmath30 is the uncertainty in @xmath26",
    ".    given the freedom to choose from upwards of 10,000 orbital weights to match only @xmath31 observables , a standard @xmath10 minimization routine can populate the distribution function in any number of ways that introduce unwanted noise . to avoid distribution functions that are noisy or unrealistic , however still consistent with the observables , we employ a maximum entropy smoothing technique developed by @xcite and described in @xcite .",
    "instead of minimizing @xmath10 , we maximize the objective function    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the number of orbits in the library , and @xmath34 is the phase - space volume of the @xmath29 orbit .",
    "see @xcite for a technical description of how we calculate phase - space volumes and maximize @xmath35 .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ entropyeq ] ) is an entropy - like quantity and the second term is @xmath10 from equation ( [ chi2eq ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 controls which term influences @xmath35 . for small @xmath36 , orbital weights are chosen to produce a smooth distribution function at the expense of reproducing the data . for large @xmath36 , the data are well - fit by the model ( @xmath10 is small ) , but the resulting distribution function is likely not smooth .",
    "we determine the appropriate @xmath36 for each model using the scheme described in @xcite .",
    "we start with @xmath37 and incrementally increase it until changes to @xmath10 between successive iterations are small .",
    "thus , the maximum entropy constraint serves to initialize the search for the minimum when @xmath37 . by slowly increasing @xmath36 , we drive down the importance of entropy to the fit until it no longer matters .",
    "the major innovation of our new modeling technique is how we choose the density profile @xmath14 of each model .",
    "current methods assume @xmath7 and calculate @xmath14 from equation ( [ param ] ) , however this requires knowledge of the appropriate parameterization for @xmath7 .",
    "we use a fundamentally different strategy and divide @xmath14 into  discrete points whose value @xmath38 at radius @xmath39 is labeled @xmath40 .",
    "the  points are spaced evenly in @xmath41 and connected by straight line segments .",
    "each trial density profile is now defined by the @xmath40 at each of the  bins .",
    "we run many models adjusting the values of the @xmath40 so as to sample all possible density profiles .",
    "this strategy requires no assumptions to be made about the shape of @xmath14 or @xmath7 , but it is computationally intensive for large .    the choice of  is a compromise between accuracy in reproducing @xmath14 and computational resources .",
    "large values of  can make parameter space impossibly large , while small values can be overly restrictive on @xmath14 .",
    "we have experimented with @xmath42 , 7 , and 10 .",
    "the added freedom with @xmath437 or 10 was not found to be worth the increase to the dimensionality of parameter space .",
    "we have also tried connecting the @xmath40 with splines , but found the additional freedom produced unrealistic density profiles .",
    "concern over the smoothness of @xmath14 may be mitigated by the fact that @xmath14 only matters to our models in that it determines the potential .",
    "as the potential is the integral of @xmath14 , this introduces additional smoothness .",
    "we extrapolate the density at the outermost point as a power law with slope @xmath44 .",
    "the only parameters in the model are the @xmath40 themselves and the extrapolation slope @xmath44",
    ". the models also have the flexibility to add a central black hole of mass @xmath45 to the galaxy for future studies .",
    "once the best - fitting @xmath14 is found , the task remains still to recover the underlying dark matter density profile .",
    "this involves finding some other constraint on the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we can often determine @xmath12 from simple stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "the required input for ssp models varies greatly , and different methods are appropriate depending on the galaxy modeled .",
    "for example , if spectra are available , stellar population synthesis models or lick indices can be used .",
    "lacking spectra , one can use the relations between broad - band colors and @xmath12 @xcite . in nearby dsph galaxies where individual stars are resolved ,",
    "color - magnitude diagrams can be constructed to fit for age and metallicity with isochrones .",
    "we can also evaluate the radial variation of @xmath12 as well without much additional effort .",
    "spectral or photometric data need only be spatially binned with the same procedure repeated at each bin .",
    "once @xmath12 is calculated , stellar density is simply the product of the ( possibly radially varying ) @xmath46 .",
    "we apply our new non - parametric schwarzschild modeling technique to study the nearby draco dsph .",
    "draco is a satellite galaxy of the milky way orbiting at a distance from the sun of only @xmath47  kpc @xcite . at this distance",
    "individual stars are resolved even with ground - based observatories .",
    "consequently , the data we use are radial velocities of individual stars .",
    "radial velocities are available for 158 stars in draco , and we present radial velocities from new observations of an additional 12 stars near the center of draco .",
    "we choose draco because it is the most dark matter - dominated of the `` classical '' ( pre - sdss ) dsphs .",
    "we can therefore differentiate between dark and luminous mass more easily since the baryons contribute less to the total density profile than they do in larger galaxies .",
    "consequently , we can absorb larger uncertainties in @xmath12 .",
    "the primary science goal of this work , and a future study of all dsphs , is to determine the functional form of the dark matter profile in dsphs and compare results to theoretical predictions by cdm .        .",
    "red stars have @xmath48  , blue stars have @xmath49  , and the green star has a radial velocity between @xmath50 and @xmath51  of @xmath52 .",
    "[ cmd],width=377 ]    we use a combination of published radial velocities and new observations for kinematics in draco .",
    "data exist at larger radii for 158 stars @xcite , but we wish to explore the central region of draco in order to have the best constraint on the inner slope of @xmath7 .",
    "to accomplish this , we observe the center of draco with the virus - w integral field unit ( ifu ) spectrograph @xcite on the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "this instrument allows for a high density of stars to be observed simultaneously , but with the drawback that fibers are not positionable .",
    "there are 267 fibers that cover the @xmath53 field of view with a @xmath54 fill factor .",
    "we observed the spectral region covering @xmath55  to @xmath56  with a resolving power @xmath57 .",
    "the observations took place over the first half of 5 nights from 2011 august 1 - 5 in excellent conditions .",
    "seeing was typically 2or better , which is smaller than the 32 diameter fibers .",
    "the standard battery of bias , hg - ne arc lamp , and twilight calibration frames were taken at the start of each night .",
    "we use an early implementation of the cure data reduction software .",
    "cure is being developed as the pipeline for the hobby - eberly dark energy experiment ( hetdex ) @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe steps taken to reduce the virus - w data .",
    "a detailed description of cure is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we perform standard ccd processing steps , using the fitstools package ( described in @xcite ) , to create master bias , twilight flat , and arc lamp images for each night .",
    "we use twilight flats in combination with arc lamp images to determine the distortion solution  a two - dimensional map which translates the ( x , y ) position of a pixel on the ccd to a fiber number and wavelength .",
    "our science frames consist of 15-minute integrations of a single pointing of the central part of the galaxy . prior to observing ,",
    "we determined the optimal position of the ifu by examining _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ photometry of the central region @xcite . with accurate fiber and star positions",
    ", we determined a pointing that maximizes the number of bright stars on fibers ( see figure [ fibmap ] ) .",
    "there are 57 science frames with this pointing , totaling roughly 14 hours of integration .",

    "we then collapse and median - combine these science frames along with the twilight flat frames .",
    "each night s stacked science frame is divided by the appropriate master flat for that night .    since the majority of the 267 fibers in the ifu are on empty sky , we are able to calculate an accurate sky model directly from each science frame .",

    ", we automatically remove the contribution from earth - sun motion .",
    "we perform the cross - correlation analysis on the combined image , and in doing so introduce a small bias due to the change in the heliocentric velocity correction over the course of the observing run .",

    "uncertainties are large on @xmath126 , likely due to the small number of radial velocities available as kinematic constraint .",
    "to constrain the anisotropy better , more radial velocities are needed .",
    "since we eventually fit our non - parametric dark matter profile with a power law , one can ask why we do not initially use a power law - parameterized profile .",
    "this would seem advantageous , especially given the large parameter space required by non - parametric methods .",
    "this reasoning , however , relies on the assumption that we know the profile is a power law a priori .",
    "the point of this study is to relax this assumption and see what type of profile comes out of the modeling , rather than impose unjustified interpretation on the problem .",

    "the effects of baryons are still not well - understood , and could potentially drive @xmath9 to different values on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis .",
    "these effects are the sum of at least two competing processes .",
    "adiabatic compression @xcite draws in dark matter boosting the central @xmath145 and driving @xmath9 to more negative values . on the other hand ,",
    "feedback from star formation and supernovae can cause strong outflows @xcite which can in turn remove dark matter from the centers of galaxies , reshaping cuspy profiles into @xmath5 cores .    in a recent paper , @xcite use high resolution cosmological @xmath67-body simulations with a fully hydrodynamical treatment of baryons to test these two competing effects in low - mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "they find that the cuspiness of the dark matter halo is directly related to the amount of star formation activity in the galaxy .",
    "this is expressed as a correlation between @xmath9 and stellar mass @xmath146 .",
    "their interpretation is that galaxies that form more stars ( larger @xmath146 ) have more supernovae and a greater potential to turn a cuspy dark matter profile into a core . using their least - squares fit to the @xmath146-@xmath9 correlation",

    "this is in approximate agreement with our measured value of @xmath134 .    perhaps owing to the lack of stellar velocities available in draco compared to other dsphs",
    ", there are not many studies investigating its dark matter profile through dynamical models .",
    "a rough comparison can be made with @xcite who fit profiles with an inner slope of @xmath134 and an outer exponential cutoff at large radii .",
    "they find a total mass - to - light ratio that varies with radius between @xmath149  in the inner @xmath150  pc .",
    "these values are comparable to the total mass - to - light ratio we calculate in the inner @xmath151  pc . however ,",
    "unlike @xcite we do not impose an exponential cutoff in @xmath7 at large radii .",

    "importantly , @xmath153 ( the stellar mass - to - light ratio we derive from ssp models ) at all radii .",
    "this means we can confidently state that draco is dark matter - dominated at all radii , allowing us to easily absorb errors in @xmath117 from ssp models . in other words , when determining @xmath7 from equation ( 1 ) the uncertainty in @xmath14 dominates the uncertainty in stellar density since the product @xmath46 is much smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "this is one of the reasons we choose to test this non - parametric technique on draco first . in the future we plan to extend this analysis to the remaining local group dsphs , which are also thought to be dark matter - dominated everywhere .",

    "for draco we measure @xmath158 , and in fornax @xcite measure @xmath159 .",
    "we would prefer to compare the total mass of each galaxy , but there are no kinematic tracers far enough out in the halo that the density profile declines sharply enough to keep mass finite for any dsph .",
    "consequently , we can not constrain the total mass observationally and we must rely on comparions to simulations ( section 5.4 ) .",
