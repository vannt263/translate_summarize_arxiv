    "many scenarios for baryon production after reheating or during preheating have been proposed to explain the observed small baryon asymmetry , such as baryogenesis in grand unified theories ( gut ) , electroweak baryogenesis , leptogenesis , and affleck - dine ( ad ) baryogensis  @xcite .",

    "the shift symmetry imposed on the flat direction , which are scalar quark and lepton fields , is apparently incompatible with the standard - model gauge groups .",

    "<S> it is shown that , in the context of split supersymmetry , a simple model with a single complex scalar field can produce chaotic inflation and generate the observed amount of baryon asymmetry via the affleck - dine mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> while the inflaton quantum fluctuations give rise to curvature perturbation , we show that quantum fluctuations of the phase of the scalar field can produce baryonic isocurvature perturbation . combining with constraints from wmap data , all parameters in the model </S>",
