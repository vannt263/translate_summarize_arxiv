    "the investigation of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector is certain to dominate both theoretical as well as experimental high energy physics through the coming decade .",
    "high precision measurements of electroweak observables at the slc and lep indicate that the standard model higgs boson has a mass between @xmath5-@xmath6 gev at the @xmath5% confidence level with a preference towards the lower mass regime @xcite .",
    "while the standard model ( sm ) has enjoyed spectacular theoretical success , the higgs sector of the theory is the only aspect for which no `` standard '' in the experimentally tested sense has yet been set .",
    "the simplest ansatz for the higgs sector , assumed in the sm , leads to only one neutral fundamental scalar but several more complicated scenarios are a priori just as viable .",
    "well known examples include a general two doublet higgs model @xcite and the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite",
    ".    a common feature of all phenomenologically viable extensions of the sm higgs sector must be the existence of a `` sm - like '' neutral scalar in the slc / lep mass window . in the case of the mssm",
    ", the lightest neutral scalar must be lighter than the z - boson mass @xcite .",
    "radiative corrections allow its mass to reach at most @xmath7-@xmath1 gev .",
    "the introduction of additional singlet higgs bosons can of course soften this upper bound somewhat , depending mainly on the value of the stop mass @xcite , but at least the mssm would be ruled out for higher masses of the lightest neutral scalar .    among the experimentally observable higgs signals the @xmath8 coupling is of considerable interest .",
    "at the lhc it can be used as a relatively background free process @xcite . for higgs masses in the mssm regime",
    "it is actually the only feasible signal due to the large qcd background of other processes .",
    "excellent energy and angular resolutions of the detectors allow to discriminate the photon photon decay against the continuum qcd background @xcite . at the photon photon mode of the nlc",
    "it would be the primary resonance production process @xcite .    while the charged gauge boson loop gives the largest contribution in the sm @xcite",
    ", the fermion loops deserve special attention .",
    "radiation of a single gluon is not possible due to charge conjugation invariance and color conservation . for the partial width",
    "@xmath0 the fermion loops interfere destructively and for large higgs masses ( @xmath9600 gev ) the top loop nearly cancels the @xmath10 loop contribution . in that case",
    "the bottom loop would be artificially `` enhanced '' in terms of its phenomenological importance .",
    "there is of course also the possibility of @xmath11 and @xmath12 `` colluding '' in their destructive interference with the charged gauge boson loop .    in the sm ,",
    "the top quark loop yields the bulk ( almost 90% ) of the fermionic contribution to @xmath0 due to the large yukawa coupling .",
    "the bottom quark contribution is still significant (  12% ) due to larger radiative corrections expounded on below @xcite . in order to constrain new physics",
    "the theoretical sm - predictions should be as precise as possible .",
    "one main source of uncertainty in the bottom quark contribution is the fact that the strong coupling @xmath13 receives no renormalization through two loops .",
    "the same is of course also true for the top quark loop , however , the change in @xmath13 between the two mass scales is much smaller and the radiative corrections are also not as large in relative terms @xcite . the width contribution stemming from a bottom quark , however , changes up to @xmath14 for a higgs boson mass below the @xmath15 threshold depending on whether one chooses to evaluate @xmath13 at @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "tackling this uncertainty is the purpose of this work .",
    "there are two other circumstances in which a renormalization group improvement is crucial .",
    "firstly for the case of the second heavy neutral scalar predicted in any model with two complex doublets . in this scenario",
    "the aforementioned large radiative corrections would be even bigger and the clear signal identification at a future collider would hence benefit from a precise knowledge of qcd corrections . the second and possibly much more important circumstance is that of a large @xmath2 enhancement of bottom type yukawa couplings .",
    "these typically enter for two doublet higgs sectors with a @xmath18 factor in the coupling @xcite .",
    "phenomenological restrictions lead to a range roughly between @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "as the width is proportional to the square of @xmath20 , any enhancement of the coupling could be substantial , even dominating .",
    "lastly it is also theoretically of interest to study the effect of renormalization group improvements for processes involving yukawa couplings .    in the next section",
    "we briefly review the radiative corrections for the case of the bottom contribution .",
    "although an exact two loop calculation exists @xcite , the largest contribution is contained in non - sudakov double logarithms ( dl s ) and we will only review this calculation as it allows for an all orders inclusion of the renormalization group effects .",
    "the derivation of the running coupling improved form factor is then given based on a topological similarity between the @xmath21 and the sudakov vertex in terms of their double logarithmic content up to the last loop integration .",
    "we then compare the renormalization group improved form factor with effective couplings in the dl approximation and make concluding remarks about the generality of the presented results .",
    "in this section we drop the index @xmath22 as it is unnecessary in that all results derived are valid whenever the ratio @xmath23 leads to large logarithms . for phenomenological applications we have the b - quark in mind .",
    "we also explicitly only discuss the sm case . the only change for more complicated higgs sectors for the neutral scalars would be in the yukawa coupling . all dl - form factors and renormalization group effects",
    "would remain unchanged .    it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the case of a small ratio of @xmath24 large non - sudakov double logarithms occur in the amplitude @xmath4 via a fermion loop .",
    "the resulting series can be expressed in the following form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the polarization vectors and four - momenta of the photons , @xmath28 the number of colors and @xmath29 the electric charge of quark @xmath30 in units of the charge of the positron @xmath31 . the double logarithmic form factor is given by @xmath32 the leading order partial higgs width was first given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to improve the perturbative behavior of the quark loop contribution",
    "one should use running quark masses with @xmath33 as the effective scale for the photonic decay mode @xcite . within the dl approximation",
    "the scale at which to evaluate the qcd - coupling @xmath13 , however , is unrestricted . even for an exact calculation of the two @xmath34 partial higgs width",
    "the strong coupling is only renormalized at the three loop level .",
    "as mentioned above , this inherent ambiguity leads to up to @xmath14 uncertainty in the bottom contribution to the partial width @xmath35 for an intermediate mass higgs boson . in the following",
    "we will derive the renormalization group effects of inserting a running coupling into each loop evaluation for the exact one- and two - loop solution of the @xmath36-function .",
    "all higher order rg - terms would then be suppressed by @xmath37 .    in the derivation of the leading logarithmic corrections in ref .",
    "@xcite the familiar sudakov technique @xcite was used by decomposing loop momenta into components along external momenta , denoted by @xmath38 and those perpendicular to them , denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "integrating first over the perpendicular components as usual , the double logarithmic form factor of eq .",
    "[ eq : dlff ] was derived from a double integral over the sudakov form factor : @xmath40 \\label{eq : abdlff}\\ ] ]    we want to emphasize at this point that ideally one would like to have an explicit three loop calculation in order to determine the effective scale at the two loop level for a renormalization group improvement to all orders .",
    "without such a calculation is seems hard to attempt a rigorous inclusion of the running coupling , however , the form of the derivation of the non - sudakov dl s in eq .",
    "[ eq : abdlff ] is the key point .",
    "for sudakov double logarithms the relevant scale for the coupling at each loop is @xmath41 as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . following similar arguments",
    "we find that the same is true for the novel non - sudakov logarithms given in eq .",
    "[ eq : dlff ] .",
    "one way to see this is the fact that on a formal level , all insertions of gluons into the dl - topology shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrg ] have the same structure as in the sudakov case .",
    "[ eq : abdlff ] is the explicit mathematical formulation of this fact .",
    "only the last fermion loop integration separates the two cases by effectively regularizing soft divergences with the quark mass .",
    "the strong coupling receives no renormalization from this last integration , however , so that the scales of the couplings at each order are determined by the same renormalization group arguments as for the sudakov case .",
    "we start by writing @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and for qcd we have @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 as usual .",
    "up to two loops the massless @xmath36-function is independent of the chosen renormalization scheme and is gauge invariant in minimally subtracted schemes to all orders @xcite .",
    "these features will also hold for the derived renormalization group improved form factor below . from the exact next to leading order result in eq .",
    "[ eq : rc ] it is clear that a formulation in terms of @xmath48 of the series leading to the non - sudakov double logarithms is more adaptable to a renormalization group improvement",
    "[ eq : abdlff ] can be reformulated in the following form : @xmath49 the product above is set to one for @xmath50 and contains nested integrals for @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "from this expression it is clear that an incorporation of the running coupling in eq .",
    "[ eq : rc ] will not contain any landau pole singularity @xcite as @xmath54 .",
    "the fact that the strong coupling enters only at two loops means that for @xmath55 gluon insertions the first loop integral leads to a simple logarithm : @xmath56 this is a consequence of the requirement that the effective scale be @xmath57 at the @xmath55-th gluon coupling .",
    "[ fig : hrg ] indicates this schematically . for the following integrals we use @xmath58 . at the @xmath59-th order",
    "we then have : @xmath60 while the last term gives the same type of integral in the next step we use for the first contribution on the r.h.s .",
    ": @xmath61 and find @xmath62 it is clear from this derivation at the n - loop level we have @xmath63 thus we finally arrive at the complete renormalization group improved result for the hard non - sudakov form factor of fig .",
    "[ fig : hrg ] : @xmath64 \\label{eq : rgdlff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an expansion in @xmath65 gives the double logarithmic form factor in eq .",
    "[ eq : dlff ] plus subleading terms proportional to @xmath66 etc .. the bottom contribution to the width is thus proportional to @xmath67 for all higher contributions .",
    "the effect of the renormalization group improved form factor is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrg ] for the case of the b - quark .",
    "the effective scale of the coupling in the dl approximation close to @xmath68 and thus within a factor of two to three lower than the mean logarithmic scale @xmath69 .",
    "[ fig : hrg ] also displays that eq .",
    "[ eq : rgw ] will remain inside the upper and lower dl - limits in the asymptotic regime .",
    "we checked that by setting @xmath70 in @xmath71 we find almost the same effective scale .",
    "a similar effect can be found in the background process to @xmath72 at a photon photon collider where also large non - sudakov dl s",
    "enter @xcite . in this case",
    "the effect of the renormalization group improvement is larger as it already occurs at the two loop level but the effective scale in that process is of the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the partial higgs width @xmath73 is essential for the experimental discovery of a neutral scalar higgs boson below 140 gev and its production at the photon photon mode of the nlc .",
    "large qcd non - sudakov double logarithms enhance the bottom contribution relative to the top in the standard model up to 12 % but it may be much larger if more complex higgs sector scenarios are realized in nature .",
    "the main uncertainty for existing qcd corrections remained in the scale of the coupling , leaving up to a 17 % uncertainty in the bottom contribution . in this paper",
