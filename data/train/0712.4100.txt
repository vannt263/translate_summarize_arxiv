    "in hierarchical clustering models , self - bound dark matter haloes increase their mass by merging with other haloes @xcite .",
    "these mergers are expected to affect the galaxy populations hosted by the merging haloes @xcite , possibly triggering star formation or agn activity @xcite . as a result , there has been some interest , both analytic and numerical , in estimating when such mergers happen .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the number density of haloes with mass in the range d@xmath0 about @xmath0 at time @xmath2 . as a result of mergers , @xmath3 is the sum of two competing effects - the number of objects in a given mass bin increases if smaller mass objects merge to form an object of precisely this mass - an event we call _ creation _ - or the number decreases as objects of this mass merge with others , thus depleting the number in the bin - an event we call _",
    "destruction_. thus , the time derivative of the halo mass function is the difference of the creation and destruction rates : @xmath4 for the star formation and agn problems above , one is more interested in the creation rates @xmath5 than in @xmath3 .    given @xmath6 , it is easy enough to take the time derivative ; the problem is to separate @xmath3 into its two contributions .",
    "roughly speaking , low mass objects may have undergone significant mergers in the past but they are not being created in merging events any more - their evolution is expected to be dominated by the destruction term .",
    "in contrast , extremely massive objects are undergoing substantial merging activity at the current time , and the time derivative of the halo mass function should be a good estimator of the creation rate of these objects . but quantifying the general case requires a richer model .",
    "early work used the @xcite form for @xmath6 , and advocated equating the ` positive ' term in @xmath3 with the creation rate , and the ` negative ' term with the destruction rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but this is clearly not a solution at all , since it provides no rule for how to determine what one should correctly equate with ` positive ' .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 , there is no particular reason why one could not have written the right hand side as @xmath8 .",
    "the second part of this paper is devoted to extracting the creation rate @xmath9 from @xmath3 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for other attempts to solve this problem .    before addressing the creation term @xmath9 ( the number density of mergers per gyr ) ,",
    "in the first part of the paper we discuss the distribution of times @xmath10 when these creation events take place ( i.e. , @xmath11 is the rate normalised by the total number of creation events that will ever occur ) .",
    "although @xmath12 and @xmath9 differ only by normalisation constant , it turns out that @xmath12 is somewhat easier to model .",
    "this is because the excursion set formalism from which the press - schechter mass function can be derived @xcite , carries with it a prescription for computing @xmath13 , the distribution of creation times @xcite . in this case , the functional form of @xmath13 is very similar to that of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mean comoving background density .    since that time",
    ", interest has shifted to functional forms for @xmath6 which more closely approximate the abundances measured in numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so it is interesting to ask how the creation time distributions are modified .",
    "@xcite argue that the relation between the functional forms of @xmath10 and @xmath16 should survive these modifications , and show that this does indeed provide a good description of halo creation in simulations .",
    "however , although they use intuition from the excursion set approach to motivate their arguments , their method side - steps the generalisation of the excursion set approach from which the modified mass functions may be derived  this is the ellipsoidal collapse ` moving ' barrier approach @xcite .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to calculate the creation time distribution self - consistently within the moving barrier excursion set approach .",
    "we do find that @xmath12 and @xmath17 are simply related , but that this is actually extremely fortuitous ",
    "appendix  [ linb ] demonstrates that this scaling does not hold generally .",
    "getting the normalisation constant which relates @xmath12 to the creation rate @xmath5 is a more challenging problem .",
    "@xcite obtained this quantity by matching the creation time distribution to the rate measured in n - body simulations in the low redshift regime ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , but they acknowledge that they have no theory for the normalisation factor .",
    "one possible solution to this problem is to explore the evolution of the halo population in terms of coagulation theory , where the creation and destruction terms are estimated separately @xcite .",
    "early applications to galaxy formation and dark - matter halo interactions include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for a more recent treatment , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for white - noise initial conditions , both the smoluchowski and the press - schechter excursion - set expressions for @xmath6 agree , so , for this case , the creation and destruction rates are known @xcite .",
    "however , obtaining the rates for more general initial conditions , or for the modified mass functions that are of more current interest , remains unsolved .",
    "the second goal of the present paper is to provide a model for the creation rate of dark matter haloes that is informed by both coagulation theory and the modified excursion set approach with moving barriers .",
    "we also study the problem of how halo creation is modified if it is known that the merging haloes are bound up in objects of mass @xmath18 at some later time @xmath19 .",
    "the excursion set theory provides a way to compute the conditional mass function @xmath20 .",
    "we show how the conditional distribution of creation times @xmath21 is related to @xmath22 . for the conditional rate ,",
    "the problem is to separate @xmath23 into creation and destruction components .",
    "@xcite argues that this conditional distribution may be the basis for understanding the phenomenon known as down - sizing ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "section  [ walks ] provides a brief summary of the excursion set approach and shows why the creation times associated with different barriers differ .",
    "sections  [ times ] and [ rates ] compare the predicted and measured n - body creation time distributions and creation rates , respectively .",
    "conditional versions of these quantities are included in the appropriate sections .",
    "a final section summarises our findings .",
    "technical details of the calculations are provided in the appendices .",
    "a few final remarks regarding the different uses of the term ` halo creation ' are in order .",
    "the first part of the paper focuses on the _ creation time distribution _ , @xmath10 , which can be derived within the excursion - set formalism .",
    "the second part focuses on the _ creation rate _ , @xmath5 , the first term in the coagulation equation ( equation  [ coag ] ) .",
    "the former is a _ normalised _ time distribution , while the latter is not normalised .",
    "( the normalised distribution is denoted with lower case @xmath12 , while the un - normalised rate is denoted with capital @xmath9 . )",
    "another source of confusion is that halo ` creation ' is distinct from halo ` formation ' ; following @xcite , the latter is typically defined as the time that an object first reaches half its current mass .",
    "see @xcite for an explicit calculation showing how creation and formation are related .",
    "in the excursion set approach , the problem of estimating the halo abundances is mapped to one of estimating the distribution of the number of steps a brownian - motion random walk must take before it first crosses a barrier of specified height @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the height of the barrier plays a crucial role .",
    "the press - schechter mass function is associated with barriers of constant height - such barriers arise naturally in models in which haloes form from a spherical collapse model . in constrast",
    ", the more accurate mass functions may be related to barriers whose height increases monotonically with the number of steps - such barriers arise naturally in ellipsoidal collapse models @xcite .    following @xcite , we will be interested in barriers of the form @xmath24^{\\gamma}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] here @xmath25 is the overdensity required for spherical collapse - it is a monotonically decreasing function of time , given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the growth factor .",
    "@xmath29 is a monotonically decreasing function of halo mass , given by @xmath30 , the variance of the initial density fluctuation field .",
    "the press - schechter mass function is associated with @xmath31 , whereas ellipsoidal collapse has @xmath32 .    when @xmath33 ( the barrier associated with spherical collapse ) all walks are guaranteed to cross the barrier , and the barriers associated with two different times do not intersect .",
    "however , if @xmath34 and @xmath35 , e.g. , for the ellipsoidal collapse barrier , then not all walks cross the barrier , and the barriers associated with two different times may intersect .",
    "@xcite suggest that the intersection of barriers may allow one to represent the possibility that haloes can fragment .",
    "this is problematic when discussing the creation rate problem , which assumes that fragmentation never occurs .",
    "for this reason , we study the limiting case of ` square - root ' barriers for which @xmath36 : @xmath37 this family of barriers is particularly interesting because an analytic solution to the first crossing distribution is available @xcite , although slightly cumbersome ( see appendix  [ ucondapp ] ) . because @xmath38 is not very different from the value associated with ellipsoidal collapse , one might have expected the predicted halo abundances associated with square - root barriers to provide a reasonable description of simulations .",
    "we show below that this can be achieved if one sets @xmath39 ( see figure  [ massf ] ) .",
    "halo merger and formation histories associated with this model are also in good agreement with simulations @xcite .",
    "the dependence on @xmath29 of the square root barrier means that it is more like the ellipsoidal than spherical collapse barrier ( which has constant height , independent of @xmath29 ) .",
    "however , there is one important respect in which the square root model is very like the constant one .",
    "consider the barriers associated with two different times . for square - root barriers",
    ", the difference between the barrier heights is @xmath40 notice that this difference is independent of @xmath29 .",
    "this is also ( trivially ) true for constant barriers , but it is not true for any other values of @xmath41 . in this respect ,",
    "the excursion set model based on square - root barriers is extremely special .",
    "this will be important later .",
    "figure  [ history ] illustrates the relation between brownian motion random walks and the mass growth history of an object .",
    "consider first the panel on the left .",
    "the jagged line shows an example of a random walk  this walk represents the run of smoothed overdensity around a randomly chosen position in the initial fluctuation field , as the region over which the overdensity is smoothed changes from large ( left ) to small ( right ) .",
    "( the plot actually shows the initial overdensity evolved to the present time using linear theory  it differs from the initial overdensity by a multiplicative constant . ) the initial overdensities are all small compared to unity , so one may associate a mass with each smoothing scale : this mass is larger for the larger smoothing scales .",
    "consider a horizontal line , and consider the places where it first intersects the random walk , as the height of this line , this barrier , is raised .",
    "clearly , this position shifts to the right as the barrier is raised ( red filled circles )  mass decreases as redshift increases .",
    "whereas the halo abundance problem corresponds to fixing the barrier height @xmath25 ( to illustrate , the height of dotted line corresponds to @xmath42 ) and asking for the distribution of @xmath29 values at which the barrier is first crossed , the halo creation problem corresponds to asking for the distribution of @xmath25 values for a fixed @xmath29 .",
    "we will use @xmath43 to denote the first crossing distribution , and @xmath44 to denote the distribution of creation times , where , for haloes of a given mass @xmath0 , @xmath45 .",
    "notice that the mass increases relatively smoothly sometimes , and rather abruptly at others .",
    "for instance , in the interval @xmath46 in the left panel , mass decreases smoothly .",
    "compare this situation to the sudden jump from @xmath47 ( red long - dashed line ) .",
    "thus , this walk does not contribute to the creation time distribution for any values of @xmath29 between 4.8 and 8.3 .",
    "but it does contribute in the calculation of halo abundances for every @xmath25 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this mass accretion history with that shown in the right panel .",
    "the same walk is shown in both panels . however ,",
    "now the horizontal dotted line at @xmath48 has been replaced by a curve that has @xmath49-intercept at @xmath50 , and increases with increasing @xmath29  this is the square - root barrier ( equation  [ sqrtbarrier ] ) associated with the same epoch as the constant one .",
    "the comparison clearly shows that the mass accretion history ( blue solid circles ) depends on the barrier shape .",
    "for instance , the values with @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are no longer included in the mass accretion history ( red solid circles ) . moreover , even if a point on the random walk happens to be part of the mass history in both cases , its associated time is different under the two barrier prescriptions .",
    "to illustrate , the point at @xmath54 is at the present for the square - root barrier case and in the !",
    "past when constant barriers are used . as a result , the halo mass function and the creation - times distribution are modified .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to quantify these changes .     denotes @xmath55 at fixed mass .",
    "triangles and circles show the distribution measured from an ensemble of random walks with constant and square - root barriers respectively .",
    "dotted and solid ( dashed ) lines show the associated predictions .",
    "the long dashed curve shows the result of inserting the @xcite form for @xmath56 into equation  ( [ cvfv ] ) .",
    "]          barriers of the form given in equation  ( [ ellbarrier ] ) are self - similar , in the sense that if @xmath25 is increased by a factor @xmath57 , then so is @xmath58 . as a result ,",
    "the first crossing distribution @xmath59 and the distribution of halo creation times @xmath60 are both simply functions of @xmath61 . in the present paper",
    "we will denote this variable as @xmath62 if @xmath25 is fixed and as @xmath63 if @xmath29 is fixed .",
    "in other words , if equation  ( [ ellbarrier ] ) describes ellipsoidal collapse , then @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "appendix  [ ucondapp ] shows that @xmath66 for the constant ( @xmath67 ) and square root ( @xmath68 ) barriers .",
    "this simple relationship is one of the central results of this paper , as is the warning that it does not hold in general .",
    "appendix  a uses a system of linear barriers to illustrate when this simple result does _ not _ apply .    to test equation  ( [ cvfv ] ) for constant and square - root barriers",
    ", we generated @xmath69 random walks with @xmath70 steps between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "then we stored the corresponding mass histories for the constant and square - root barriers ( e.g. , solid circles in figure  [ history ] ) .",
    "every @xmath73 point along the history has a corresponding @xmath63 . to study how the creation time distribution depends on @xmath29",
    ", we could have chosen the subset of walks which have the correct value of @xmath29 , and then found the distribution of @xmath74 values for those walks .",
    "however , the self - similar scaling above means that @xmath75 should be the same for all @xmath29 . as a result",

    "the symbols in figure  [ sswalk ] show the creation time distributions for the constant ( triangles ) and square - root ( circles ) barriers : the distribution associated with the square - root barrier is broader and peaks at slightly higher @xmath63 .",
    "the curves show the predicted creation time distributions ( equation  [ cvfv ] ) ; they are in excellent agreement with the measurements .",
    "equation  ( [ cvfv ] ) shows that these creation time distributions depend on the functional form of the first crossing distribution @xmath76 . for the case of square - root barriers ,",
    "we show the @xcite exact but complicated expression for @xmath76 , and a much simpler approximation for it from @xcite .",
    "the two curves are almost indistinguishable .    the use of barriers which scale self - similarly ( equation  [ ellbarrier ] ) was motivated by the observation that , when expressed as a function of @xmath62 , halo abundances in simulations could be scaled to a universal form @xcite .",
    "we have added the long - dashed curve in the figure , which shows the result of using the @xcite functional form for @xmath77 in equation  ( [ cvfv ] ) ; it is almost indistinguishable from the curves associated with the square - root barrier .",

    ". the open triangles and circles show the creation times measured in constant and square - root random walk ensembles sampled at the same redshifts as the simulations .",

    "a couple of remarks are in order .",
    "only the haloes with the highest redshift in each mass bin were treated as newly - created .",
    "these measurement were tested with different bin sizes ( not shown ) , yielding similar results .",
    "one limitation is that if d@xmath98 is too small , most bins are empty , and the data does not follow a continuous curve .",
    "one should not take d@xmath98 to be too large  in particular , the mass bins for the different values of @xmath0 should be disjoint .",
    "our choice of d@xmath98 satisfied both criteria .",
    "lastly , we found that our choice of redshift bin d@xmath99 was sufficiently large to capture enough creation events and sufficiently small for comparison with the different theory curves .",
    "the solid circles in the figure denote the n - body measurement , where only haloes with @xmath100 are considered ( notice that the lowest - mass panel has no black filled circles ) . in all cases ,",
    "improvement over the location of the peaks is seen when the square - root barrier is used",
    ". however , these curves are slightly broader than those traced by the simulation data , making the height of these normalised distributions lower .",
    "the excursion set model suggests that if the halo mass function @xmath56 can be scaled to a self - similar form , then the creation time distribution @xmath101 is also self - similar . to test this",
    "we have scaled the values of @xmath102 associated with each mass bin in the simulations to @xmath103 , and measured the resulting distribution of @xmath63 . however , because all mass bins sample the same range in @xmath25 , they sample different ranges in @xmath63 . we account for this by dividing the measured distribution of @xmath63 by a normalisation factor given by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath75 is associated with the @xcite formula .",

    "we also discuss how this quantity is related to @xmath107 , the fraction of mass in @xmath0-progenitors at time @xmath2 of a final halo of mass @xmath18 at time @xmath19 .",

    "is denoted by @xmath20d@xmath118d@xmath0 .",
    "in essence , conditioning is equivalent to finding the ( unconditional ) crossing distribution of a barrier @xmath119 in the constant barrier problem , @xmath120 .",
    "this means one simply replaces all the unconditional expressions given previously with @xmath121 and @xmath122 . as a result , the only change occurs in the self - similar variable @xmath62 ( and @xmath63 ) : @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the square - root barrier is slightly more complicated : @xmath124 because equation  ( [ bs ] ) is not quite the same functional form as equation  ( [ sqrtbarrier ] ) , the first crossing distribution is not simply a suitably rescaled version of the unconditional distribution .",
    "rather , it is a function of @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "nevertheless , the logic one follows to arrive at the creation time distribution is the same .",

    "smooth curves show the corresponding predictions ",
    "notice that they are in excellent agreement with the monte carlos .",
    "the simulation bin sizes d@xmath98 and d@xmath83 were used as in the unconditional case .",
    "selecting haloes to be conditioned to belong to a final @xmath18-halo reduces the number of creation events significantly .",
    "we selected haloes bound to end - up in clumps with mass in a bin of size d@xmath132 .",
    "as in the unconditional case ( figure  [ utimes ] ) , the distributions peak at higher redshifts and are slightly broader for lower @xmath0 ( compare left and right panels ) . the same trends are seen as one increases the final @xmath18 ( compare top and bottom panels ) .    in general , the moving barrier based curves provide a much better description of the simulations , although the agreement is by no means perfect . for example , the square root barrier tends to produce distributions which are slightly broader than those in the n - body simulation .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in the right - hand side panels .",
    "a similar effect was found by @xcite for the formation time distribution , which is related to ( but different from ) the creation time distribution of interest here ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . in that paper , we speculate that the discrepancy there was due to non - markovian effects .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a discussion of this topic .",
    "extracting the creation rate from @xmath3 ( or @xmath23 ) is a non - trivial problem . in this section",
    "we make use of halo coagulation theory to estimate this quantity .      in this formalism",
    ", the halo mass function @xmath6 obeys @xmath133 where @xmath134 is our creation term , and the destruction term is @xmath135 @xcite . in these expressions ,",
    "the coagulation kernel @xmath136 is symmetric in @xmath0 and @xmath137 .",
    "few analytic solutions to smoluchowski s equation exist . however , when the kernel is additive in mass , then the associated mass function is given by the press - schechter formula for white - noise initial conditions @xcite .",
    "of course , white - noise is a bad approximation to the initial conditions in the cdm models of current interest .",
    "moreover , we have shown that ellipsoidal collapse gives a better description of halo abundances and creation times than press - schechter ( spherical collapse ) .",
    "nevertheless , the expression obtained for the creation term in that special case , @xmath138 @xcite , will serve as a guide ( see appendix  b for more details regarding coagulation with spherical collapse and white - noise initial conditions ) .",
    "this prescription has two interesting properties .",
    "first , it is related to the creation time distribution in a simple way : @xmath139 ( please see appendix  [ cc ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that one obtains @xmath12 by normalising @xmath9 : @xmath140 this indicates that all the time dependence in the creation rate is encoded in the creation time distribution , which was amply studied in the first part of the paper . in particular , in section  [ times ]",
    "we showed that the mass function and the creation time distribution are related in a simple way ( equation  [ cvfv ] ) , at least for barriers which are close to constant or square - root .",
    "since we are in this regime , we assume that our prescription ( i.e. , @xmath141 ) works well enough for our purposes , even when the initial power spectrum is not white noise , and the barrier associated with the random walk problem which gives the mass function @xmath142 that is of interest , is not constant .",
    "the second property is that this prescription reduces to the known exact creation rate in the white - noise case .",
    "this fact , while seemingly obvious , was never imposed as a requirement to be obeyed by the creation rate in previous works @xcite .",
    "figure  [ urate ] compares this assumption with the measured creation rates in the simulations .",
    "the simulation measurements in figures  [ urate ] and [ utimes ] are the same , except that in the latter , data is normalised in time .",
    "notice that the heights of the curves increase with decreasing mass .",
    "this reflects that fact that , in hierarchical models , more small haloes are created during the history of the universe than are massive halos ( which are only created at later times ) .",
    "the constant barrier model works well for massive haloes , but it overpredicts the creation rate of less massive haloes  showing a similar discrepancy as in the press - schechter mass function in that mass regime . in all cases , the square - root barrier and the @xcite creation rates match n - body results reasonably well .",
    "we assume that the same prescription can be applied for the conditional case .",
    "i.e. , the rate of creation of haloes of mass @xmath0 at time @xmath2 conditioned to belong to @xmath18 haloes at a later time @xmath143 is given by @xmath144 @xcite . figure  [ crate ] shows our results for the same set of @xmath0 and @xmath18 as in figure  [ ctimes ] . as in the unconditional case ,",
    "the simulation measurements in figures  [ crate ] and [ ctimes ] are the same , except that in the latter , data is normalised in time .    for both choices of @xmath0 ,",
    "the height of the curves decreases with increasing final mass @xmath18 ( compare top and bottom panels ) .",
    "this effect is less pronounced for the smaller @xmath0 ( compare left and right panels ) . in all panels , curves based on the square - root barrier provide a more accurate description of the measurements .",
    "we have used the excursion set approach to study how the distribution of halo creation times is modified if haloes are assumed to form from an ellipsoidal rather than a spherical collapse ( see figure  [ history ] ) .",
    "the creation time distribution governs the time dependence in the creation term found in smoluchowski - like interpretations of the evolution of the halo mass function @xcite ( i.e. , normalising the creation rate in time gives the creation time distribution ) . in this approach ,",
    "halo abundances and creation times can be derived from the study of random walks which cross barriers of some specified height .",
    "the barrier itself is specified by the physics of gravitational collapse ; that associated with spherical collapse has a constant height and this allows simple analytic solutions for halo abundances and creation times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dropping the spherical collapse assumption is not trivial , as it results in a barrier whose height increases with distance along the walk @xcite .",
    "moveover , the moving barrier associated with ellipsoidal collapse is not well - suited to the study of creation times ( see equation  [ ellbarrier ] and related discussion , as well as discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , we approximated the ellipsoidal collapse barrier with a square - root barrier ( equation  [ sqrtbarrier ] ) for which an analytic solution for the halo mass function exists @xcite .",
    "moreover , this barrier yields a halo mass function which is in good agreement with simulations ( figure  [ massf ] ) .",
    "we used monte - carlo realisations of random walks to show that the associated creation time distribution is related to the halo mass function in just the same way that it is for the constant barrier ( equation  [ cvfv ] ) . because the halo mass functions associated with the two barriers are different , the creation time distributions also differ ( figure  [ sswalk ] )",
    "the moving barrier based predictions were in slightly better agreement with measurements of halo creation times in simulations ( figures  [ utimes ] and  [ ssnbody ] ) .",
    "we also presented the first derivation of the conditional creation time distribution using the moving - barrier model of ellipsoidal collapse . in this case , the differences between the constant and moving barrier predictions were somewhat more dramatic ; the moving barrier predictions were in substantially better agreement with the simulations ( see figure  [ ctimes ]  especially the panels on the right ) .",
    "for both the unconditional and conditional versions we showed there was a simple link between @xmath12 and @xmath17 ( equations  [ cvfv ] and [ acond ] ) , but showed that this link is special to the constant and square - root barriers . while not true in general ( see appendix  a for a counter example ) , we argued that , for the mass functions of current interest in cosmology , this link should provide reasonably accurate approximations to the creation time distribution .",
    "we also presented an approximation for the normalisation constant which converts the creation time distribution into a halo creation rate .",
    "this was motivated by connecting our results to coagulation theory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figures  [ urate ] and [ crate ] indicate that this yields reasonably accurate results .",
    "an alternative approach is to express the creation rate in terms of @xmath145 , the rate of mergers of @xmath0-haloes with @xmath137-haloes , creating @xmath146-haloes as a result .",
    "this merger rate has been measured recently in cosmological simulations @xcite and studied in the spherical @xcite and ellipsoidal @xcite collapse versions of the excursion set approach .",
    "the problem in this case is that , with the exception of white - noise initial conditions , the excursion set theory predicts that @xmath147 @xcite ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a possible solution ) .",
    "even if the merger rate were defined unambiguously within the excursion set approach with moving barriers , care must be taken when the integrals in equations  ( [ csmol ] ) and ( [ dsmol ] ) are computed .",
    "our prescription of the creation rate circumvents these problems altogether .",
    "a third possible method is to use the merger rate developed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this method avoids the complications in the excursion set theory by estimating the coagulation kernel @xmath148 numerically .",
    "unfortuntely , the answer in this case depends on the choice of regularisation technique .",
    "the formulation a complete model for halo mergers with general initial conditions and with the advantages of ellipsoidal collapse remains an open , and quite interesting , problem .",
    "halo creation rates have been used to model star formation and agn activity .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for applications of halo creation where our results can provide an improvement . in some cases",
    ", the derivative of the mass function d@xmath149d@xmath95 is used to replace the creation rate  while in others , the creation rate is extracted from d@xmath149d@xmath95 without proper justification ( see the references in the introduction ) .",
    "it is our hope that our analysis will be useful for such studies .",
    "we caution , however , that a halo may be created smoothly through a process of gradual accretion , or violently , through a merger .",
    "if this difference matters , it may be more appropriate to use a full merger history tree .",
    "@xcite describes such moving - barrier based trees  in this context , also see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon called ` down - sizing ' is often associated with two trends : ( a ) the tendency for the most massive galaxies to host the oldest stars , and ( b ) the tendency , at later times , for star formation to occur in haloes of lower mass .",
    "our creation time distributions conditioned on final halo mass have been used to understand trend ( a ) : if star formation only occurs in sufficiently massive haloes , then ( a ) arises naturally in hierarchical models @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed by @xcite , who then found that they were unable to explain trend ( b ) using this same mechanism .",
    "however , a corrollary of sheth s argument is that , if star formation does _ not _ occur in haloes _ above _ a certain critical mass , then trend ( b ) is the result .",
    "that is to say , if stars only form in halos between a minimum and maximum mass range , then down - sizing trend ( a ) is the result of the minimum mass , and trend ( b ) is the result of the maximum mass .",
    "therefore , we expect our results to provide further insight into this phenomenon in general , and into the critical mass scales in particular .",

    "the main difference is that the latter peak at some intermediate value of @xmath63 , whereas the former decreases monotonically with @xmath63 .",

    "this is because the linear barrier becomes steeper as @xmath25 decreases .",
    "since the height of a linear barrier decreases with @xmath29 , it becomes easier for walks to upcross a barrier as @xmath25 decreases .",

    "if equation  ( [ lucky ] ) is incorrect in general , then why then did it work so well in the main text ?",
    "the first step is to recognize that , because of the property highlighted by equation  ( [ whyitworks ] ) , a uniform distribution in @xmath25 is appropriate for the family of square - root barriers of interest to us ( equation  [ sqrtbarrier ] ) , and so , for square - root barriers , equation  ( [ lucky ] ) is exact .",
    "our monte carlo simulations shown in the main text confirm that this is indeed the case .",
    "the second step is to note that , for barriers with general @xmath41 , the difference between two barriers carries additional factors of @xmath25 ( e.g. , equation  [ ellbarrier ] ) . as a result ,",
    "assumption  ( [ fdelta ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "e.g. , for linear barriers , @xmath192 this property makes the linear barrier considerably different from the constant and square - root barriers .",
    "figure  [ linbayes ] shows that the distance between any two linear barriers increases with increasing @xmath29 ( compare with figure  [ history ] ) , so the @xmath25-prior is not uniform .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the central conclusion of this and the previous subsection  that the assumptions behind equation  ( [ cvfv ] ) do not hold in general  do not depend on the fact that the linear barrier decreases in height with @xmath29 .",
    "e.g. , barriers of the form given by equation  ( [ ellbarrier ] ) with @xmath34 and @xmath193 increase with @xmath29",
    ". however , @xmath194 the separation between any two barriers increases with @xmath29 , so the @xmath25-prior is not uniform in this case either . for these barriers too , equation  ( [ lucky ] ) is incorrect .",
