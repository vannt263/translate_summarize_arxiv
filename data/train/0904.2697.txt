    "in recent years , there is a growing interest in research on complexity science .",
    "common features of physical , technical , biological , social and computational systems are qualified as constituting what we call complex systems",
    ". a final definition of a complex system would be premature .",
    "what is repeated in different formulations is a system built up from many interacting components. further , properties of a `` complex system '' are not fully explained by an understanding of its component parts @xcite .",
    "this notion allows to expect a formulation of phenomenological ( as opposed to ab initio ) laws which could be valid at intermediate levels of integration of system structure .",
    "the component parts can be reduced to simple mathematical objects , still the observed or derived laws can reveal new and unexpected aspects of a complex system .",
    "+ archetypal examples of complex systems are growing networks @xcite .",
    "they consist of nodes , and some of these nodes are linked together .",
    "this generalization of the cartesian lattices became an object of research of computational scientists in 1998 , when watts and strogatz published their seed paper @xcite .",
    "since then , the list of relevant references grown to thousands ; for some recent monographs we refer to @xcite .",
    "a specific branch of complexity emerges around networks decorated with ising spins @xmath9 at each node .",
    "there , the interaction between linked spins can favorize the same ( ferromagnet ) or different ( antiferromagnet , af ) signs .",
    "this generalization is known @xcite to enrich the list of problems and possible applications of complex networks .",
    "+    here we are interested in statistics of avalanches in growing networks with af interaction .",
    "the case of af is more complex , because this interaction leads to the effect of frustration of spins in disordered structures @xcite .",
    "frustration means in particular that once three nodes are connected to each other , spins at these nodes can not have different signs ; at least two spins must be of the same signs , what raises the energy .",
    "further , there are many states with the minimal ( ground state ) energy , while for a ferromagnet there are only two ground states . in frustrated networks ,",
    "the spectrum of ground states can be very rich and complex , and their number increases exponentially with the system size @xcite . counting and classification of these states is then computationally unfeasible .",
    "it seems that an information on the probability distribution of the number of states which lead to the same local minimum can be related with the spectrum of connected avalanches .",
    "+ the numerical experiment is conducted as follows .",
    "we vary the external field what leads to flipping of groups of spins .",
    "two runs are performed with using the same set of random numbers . in one run",
    "we keep one spin blocked in the direction opposite to its direction in equilibrium before the field is changed .",
    "the number of spins which behave in a different way is the size @xmath1 of a connected avalanche .",
    "the method is known as the damage spreading technique @xcite . in previous numerical experiments @xcite the size of an avalanches was calculated just as the number of flipped spins .",
    "that method did not differ between connected and disconnected avalanches .",
    "+ the goal of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , the avalanche spectra in the growing networks are characterized by the same statistics , as the degree distributions in these networks .",
    "this means , that the probability distribution of avalanche size @xmath1 in the exponential networks is exponential , and the one in the scale - free networks is the power function .",
    "our second finding is that the obtained mean range @xmath0 of avalanches , i.e. the maximal distance reached by an avalanche from the damaged site , scales with the avalanche size @xmath1 as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of nodes in the network .",
    "the exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 increase from zero for @xmath14 ( trees ) and they are approximately constant above some value of @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the growing parameter , i.e. the number of nodes to which new nodes are attached . above @xmath15 ,",
    "the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are almost the same for the exponential and the scale - free networks .",
    "+ in next section , the calculations and results are described in details .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion .",
    "the scheme of our calculation is basically the same as in @xcite ; the difference is that here we apply the damage spreading technique .",
    "avalanches are measured in the numerical experiment with the hysteresis loop .",
    "energy of spin @xmath16 is calculated as    @xmath17\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the magnetic field energy .",
    "the energy units are @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the antiferromagnetic exchange integral .",
    "the field is changed from @xmath21 to @xmath22 by 1 , where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the maximal degree in a given network .",
    "each field change is performed @xmath11 times , where @xmath11 is the size of the network ; in this way each spin is blocked once for the ds technique .",
    "simulations are performed for four different orders of the sequence of nodes : ( a ) from the oldest to the newest nodes , ( b ) from the newest to the oldest nodes , ( c ) with random permutations , and ( d ) with one selected sequence .",
    "the obtained plots indicate that these variants do not differ qualitatively .",
    "+ the avalanche spectra , i.e. the number @xmath25 of avalanches of size @xmath1 for the exponential and the scale - free growing networks are shown in fig . 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "these calculations are performed for the network size @xmath26 nodes , and the spectra are averaged over @xmath27 networks .",
    "the obtained relations for the exponential networks can be parametrized as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 for @xmath14 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for @xmath33 . for the scale - free networks",
    ", the relation @xmath34 applies .",
    "there , @xmath35 for @xmath14 , @xmath36 for @xmath31 , and @xmath37 for @xmath33 .",
    "+ these results indicate that the avalanche spectrum is determined by degree distribution of the network .",
    "we checked how the avalanche size depends of the degree of a node where the damage was started .",
    "the obtained plots are shown in figs . 3 and 4 , for the exponential and the scale - free networks , respectively .",
    "+ we investigate also the range @xmath0 of avalanches , i.e. the maximal distance reached by an avalanche from the damaged site , against the avalanche size @xmath1 . due to computational limitations",
    ", these calculations could be performed for the network size not larger than @xmath38 .",
    "however , here we got the finite - size scaling relations    @xmath39    with the shapes of the functions @xmath40 shown in figs .",
    "5 - 8 for @xmath14 and @xmath33 , the exponential and the scale - free networks . for @xmath14 results are averaged over @xmath41 networks ( @xmath38 ) and over @xmath42 ( for others @xmath11 ) . for @xmath33 number of networks are @xmath41 except @xmath38 where @xmath43.the results on the obtained exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 against the growing parameter @xmath5 are shown in fig .",
    "these results indicate that @xmath14 is a special case , where the scaling relation does not depend on the network size @xmath11 . on the contrary , for @xmath5 between 4 and 10 the plots do not depend qualitatively on @xmath5 , and the values of the exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 seem to reach their asymptotic values .",
    "this is confirmed by the calculation for @xmath6 , where we get @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the scale - free ( exponential ) networks .",
    "most important result is that the exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the same for the exponential networks and the scale - free networks .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the spectrum of avalanches is described by the same function as the degree distribution in the growing network",
    ". a most simple explanation of this result could be that an avalanche contains all nodes in the direct neighborhood of a damaged node ; the range of such avalanches is just one .",
    "we see that this is not the case ; in general , the range of avalanche excesses 1 . still , the observed coincidence indicates that there is a monotoneous relation between the size of avalanche and the degree of the node at the avalanche origin .",
    "we checked numerically that indeed such a relation does appear .",
    "in other words , an avalanche born in a damaged site increases with the degree of this site . however , the obtained exponent @xmath46 clearly decreases with the growing parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this is in contradiction to the node degree distribution in the scale - free networks , where the appropriate exponent does not vary with @xmath5 .",
    "perhaps the finite size effect is enhanced here by the deviation of the relation @xmath47 from linearity , as observed in fig .",
    "4 . note that this argument is not related to the exponential networks , where the deviation from linearity ( fig .",
    "3 ) is not observed , but the exponent @xmath48 is known to decrease with @xmath5 @xcite . +",
    "the second result independent on the network topology is the scaling relation between the range and size of the avalanches , i.e. @xmath49 . for trees ( @xmath14 ) , the exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 vanish , what reflect the fact that in linear chains the range and the size of avalanches is the same . for @xmath15 and larger ,",
    "@xmath12 is close to 1/2 and @xmath13 is close to 1/3 with the numerical accuracy .",
    "this is true for the exponential and the scale - free networks .",
    "the plateau of the function @xmath40 , shown in fig .",
    "3 , reveals that the range of avalanches is limited : the scaling relation found here suggests that the origin of this limitation is the size of the network .",
    "we are not aware of any analytical calculation of the range of avalanches .",
    "the topological disorder of the network , combined with the frustration , can produce a kind of magnetic disorder , analogous to the random field model @xcite ; perhaps some results of this model could be applied also to the antiferromagnetic growing networks .",
