    "semiconductor superlattices ( sls ) are nanostructures formed from several alternating layers of different semiconductor materials @xcite .",
    "this periodic structure leads to the formation of energy minibands that enable electrons , in the presence of an electric field , to demonstrate a number of interesting quantum - mechanical phenomena , which include the formation of wannier - stark ladders , sequential and resonant tunneling , bragg reflections , and bloch oscillations .",
    "consequently , sls are of a great interest for both fundamental and applied science @xcite . due to the high mobility of miniband electrons and the very high frequency of the bloch and charge - domain oscillations ,",
    "sls have prospective applications in sub - thz and thz electronic devices @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that a tilted magnetic field applied to a sl can strongly affect , and hence control , the electrical properties of the structure .",
    "nonlinear interaction between the electronic bloch oscillations along the superlattice and cyclotron motion in the plane of the layers induces chaotic semiclassical electron dynamics , which , depending on the ratio between the bloch and cyclotron frequencies , either accelerate or decelerate charge transport through the sl @xcite .",
    "coupling of cyclotron and bloch motion by a tilted magnetic field has also been related to the fiske effect in superconducting josephson junctions @xcite . on resonance , when the bloch and cyclotron frequencies are commensurate , the electrons",
    "exhibit a unique type of quantum chaos , which does not obey kolmogorov - arnold - moser theory@xcite .",
    "this type of chaos is characterised by the formation of intricate `` web - like '' structures , known in the literature as `` stochastic webs ''",
    "@xcite , which extend throughout the phase space of the miniband electrons .",
    "the appearance of these webs abruptly delocalises the electrons in real space , thus significantly increasing their drift velocity @xcite .",
    "similar dynamics can occur in other spatially periodic systems in which wave interference gives rise to band transport phenomena , including ultracold atoms in an optical lattice @xcite , graphene @xcite , and light propagating through spatially - modulated photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "on the quantum level , such resonant delocalisation of the electrons manifests itself in the formation of additional magnetic - field - induced miniband structure corresponding to extended electron states , which extend across many periods of the sl @xcite .",
    "this delocalisation dramatically affects the collective electron behavior by inducing multiple propagating charge domains and ghz - thz current oscillations with frequencies and amplitudes much higher than with no tilted field @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that in the vicinity of bloch - cyclotron resonances the usually unstable bloch gain profile becomes stable @xcite , which can be used for the amplification of thz signals .",
    "although the above effects of the bloch - cyclotron resonances on electron dynamics have been reported for different finite temperatures , it is still unclear how the character of charge transport in the sl changes with temperature .     plane represent quantum wells ( tunnel barriers ) within the superlattice .",

    "we find that the thermal distribution of the electrons can , counter - intuitively , enhance the effect of bloch - cyclotron resonances on the drift velocity .",
    "in particular , increasing the temperature makes the resonant maxima in the drift velocity versus electric field characteristics more prominent .",

    "as @xmath28 increases further , @xmath156 starts to increase .",
    "this is due to the effect of temperature on the current density , @xmath161 , which is described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : j_eq ] ) and ( [ eq : diff_eq ] ) .",
    "as noted above , the generation of oscillating current in the sl is associated with the formation of traveling change domains , which occurs when the voltage , @xmath162 , dropped across the active layers of the sl becomes sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : volt ] ) shows that this voltage is the difference between the total voltage , @xmath142 , applied to the sl and the voltage , @xmath144 , dropped across the contacts .",
    "the voltage , @xmath144 , in turn , may be expressed as @xmath163 , where @xmath164 describes the effect of charge accumulation and depletion in the emitter and collector regions .",
    "thus , any changes in the maximal value of @xmath161 and , therefore , of @xmath165 , will affect @xmath144 , and thus shift the threshold voltage @xmath156 . for low temperatures ,",
    "when electron diffusion can be neglected , increasing @xmath28 decreases the maximal electron drift velocity and , thus , the maximal value of @xmath165 .",
    "this reduces the voltage , @xmath144 , dropped across the contacts , since this is proportional to the current through those contacts . when @xmath144 decreases but @xmath142 remains constant , the voltage , @xmath162 , dropped across the active layers of the sl increases .",
    "thus , within some temperature range , increasing @xmath28 decreases @xmath156 .",
    "the value of @xmath156 and the corresponding critical dc current @xmath166 can be estimated analytically at low @xmath28 and when @xmath42 . if one neglects electron diffusion and uses the drift velocity given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxdriftvelocityt>0theta=0 ] ) , the critical current , @xmath167 , at temperature @xmath28 can be estimated as @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the critical current for @xmath47  k. according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : volt ] ) , the critical voltage , @xmath170 , required for current oscillations is @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the voltage dropped across the sl layers .",
    "assuming that @xmath164 and @xmath162 are almost independent of @xmath28 , one obtains @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the critical voltage at @xmath47 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : criticalcurrent ] ) and ( [ eq : criticalvoltage ] ) it follows that @xmath175    the @xmath176 curve defined by eq .",

    "[ fig : ivsv ]  ( a ) and [ fig : fvsv](a ) it is easy to see that for the low @xmath28 values considered ( @xmath178 k ) , the analytical values of @xmath156 and @xmath167 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : criticalline ] ) are in excellent quantitative agreement with those inferred from the numerical @xmath152 curves .    for large @xmath28 ,",
    "the diffusion contribution to the current becomes important and eq .",
    "( [ eq : criticalline ] ) fails .",
    "as @xmath28 increases , the current through the sl and the voltage dropped across the contacts also increase , thereby raising @xmath156 .",
    "the same mechanism operates when @xmath155 . in this case",
    ", @xmath156 is larger than for @xmath42 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fvsv ] ) .",
    "this is because in the presence of a tilted magnetic field , the maximal drift velocity is larger due to the onset of bloch - cyclotron resonances ( compare figs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that a tilted magnetic field strongly affects , and can significantly enhance , the transport characteristics of sls  even at room temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the electron drift velocity in the presence of a tilted magnetic field is quite different from the @xmath42 case . in particular",
    ", increasing @xmath28 quickly suppresses the @xmath42 esaki - tsu peak in the @xmath90 curve but has a much smaller effect when a tilted magnetic field is applied . in this geometry ,",
    "increasing @xmath28 sometimes even enhances the drift velocity peaks , relative to the background , caused by the bloch - cyclotron resonances . as a result ,",
    "when @xmath49 and @xmath4 are both non - zero , the electrons move faster , which increases both the dc- and ac - components of the current through the sl and also improves its high - frequency performance .",
    "the effects of temperature on the @xmath90 curves also transform the sl s @xmath152 curves by inducing new instabilities and transport regimes , which we hope will stimulate future experimental and theoretical studies .",
