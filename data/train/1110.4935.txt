    "mechanical sensing is at the threshold of an important new breakthrough .",
    "one potential advantage of operating micromechanical sensors in the quantum regime is that this opens the way to measurement techniques that can circumvent the standard quantum limit .",

    "while the classical noise squeezing of micromechanical oscillators has already been achieved @xcite , squeezing below the standard quantum limit still remains to be demonstrated .",
    "a number of techniques have been proposed , including conditional squeezing using a parametrically coupled electromagnetic cavity driven by one @xcite or two sidebands @xcite detuned from the cavity resonance by the mechanical oscillation frequency , and are expected to be demonstrated experimentally in the near future .",
    "this paper proposes an alternative scheme where a nanoscale cantilever can be prepared in a squeezed state by purely mechanical means via the nonlinearity provided by the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between a vibrating classical fork and the cantilever .",
    "we also show that the squeezing can be detected via state transfer to an optical field coupled to the cantilever in an optical resonator configuration  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the impact of the various sources of noise , including both the noise of the classical driving force and the clamping noise of the cantilever and also comment on limitations to the state transfer scheme resulting from the dynamics of the light field and from the opening of an associated dissipation channel .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows :",
    "section ii introduces our model system and demonstrates how the anharmonic potential that describes the magnetic coupling between the classical fork and the quantum mechanical cantilever results in quadrature squeezing of the cantilever motion under appropriate conditions .",
