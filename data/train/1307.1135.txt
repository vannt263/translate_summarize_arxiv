    "in the current concordance @xmath16cdm cosmological models , structure formation occurs hierarchically , with low - mass dark matter ( dm ) halos forming first at high redshifts , and more massive halos forming later via the merging , or accretion , of these low - mass halos . in this framework ,",
    "the most massive collapsed objects at any epoch are the dynamically most immature . in the local universe these most massive , immature dm halos host galaxy clusters . this hierarchical framework of structure formation affects galaxy evolution in two ways .",
    "firstly , the massive _ central _ galaxies of dm halos are themselves hierarchically assembled via the merger and accretion of smaller galaxies , a process which primarily occurs at high redshifts .",
    "numerical simulations show that massive early - type galaxies can be assembled rapidly in this `` revised - monolithic '' scheme @xcite , consuming their gas in a short burst , before being quenched either via extreme qso feedback triggered by major mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or quasi - continual `` radio feedback '' from low - luminosity agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the extent of this process depends on the initial conditions in which galaxies form .",
    "massive galaxies are formed earlier in the highest overdensities of the primordial density field @xcite , and have a more active merger history at @xmath17 @xcite , than those that form in the smoother low - density regions .",
    "this leaves its imprints in the environmental trends of galaxy poplations observed at early epochs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "secondly , as the dm halos which host many of these massive _ central _ galaxies are accreted onto more massive systems , these galaxies become _ satellites _ within galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "this process of becoming satellites is also known to affect the ability of galaxies to continue forming stars , as empirically the fraction of satellite galaxies which have become passive is always greater than for central galaxies of the same stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most plausible and likely causes of the systematic quenching of star formation in galaxies upon accretion into massive halos are their interactions with the dense intra - cluster medium ( icm ) which pervades the virialized regions of groups and clusters .",
    "this occurs either via the partial or complete ram - pressure stripping of their cold gas contents due to their high - velocity ( @xmath18000kms@xmath10 ) passage through the dense icm @xcite , or the milder starvation mechanism in which they are simply prevented from accreting new gas from the surrounding inter - galactic medium , and so slowly consume their remaining cold gas through star formation over a period of gyr @xcite .",
    "observations of spirals in local clusters show evidence for ongoing ram - pressure stripping , with 1030kpc long one - sided extra - galactic tails of hi gas all pointing away from the cluster center @xcite , similar to those produced in hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "many cluster spirals also show truncated hi radial profiles and h@xmath19 disks characteristic of the selective outside - in removal of gas symptomatic of ram - pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "the key to establishing which physical processes are responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies when they are accreted into massive halos , as well as quantifying their efficiency , is to derive empirical constraints for the average time - scales required by the quenching mechanism to shut down star formation in these satellite galaxies , the dependence on halo mass for its efficiency , and its effective range in terms of cluster - centric radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , to date it remains unresolved whether this environmental quenching process is a rapid ( @xmath2000myr ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or slow ( @xmath18gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) process , or whether it includes a prior starburst phase @xcite .",
    "there is also disagreement as to whether environmental quenching becomes more efficient with increasing host dm halo mass @xcite , or is alternatively independent of halo mass @xcite .",
    "the combined impacts of these two aspects of structure formation are responsible for producing the strong environmental trends observed in local galaxy populations , as classically quantified by the star formation ( sf)density @xcite and morphology  density relations @xcite .",
    "field galaxies that have evolved in relative isolation are primarily star - forming spirals , while moving to the densest regions in the cores of groups and clusters , the dominant population shifts to passive ellipticals and s0s , with star - forming spirals now essentially absent .",

    "* hereafter bo84 ) showed that the fraction of blue ( star - forming ) galaxies among cluster members increases from almost zero in the local universe to @xmath21% by @xmath15 .",
    "this implies a rapid evolution in the cluster population over the last five billion years , in which empirically the star - forming spiral galaxies found by bo84 in clusters at @xmath15 are mostly replaced by passive s0s in local clusters @xcite .",
    "more recently , infrared studies of cluster galaxies with _ spitzer _ @xcite and _ herschel _ @xcite have mapped in detail this rapid increase of star formation activity among cluster galaxies to @xmath22 and beyond ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . while lirgs ( @xmath230m@xmath9yr@xmath10 ) have been shown to be essentially absent in all _ spitzer _ analyses of nearby ( @xmath24 ) rich clusters @xcite , dusty star - forming galaxies with @xmath250m@xmath9yr@xmath10 were found to be common in clusters at @xmath2640.5 @xcite .",
    "the systematic decline in star formation in galaxies since @xmath22 is however not just limited to those in clusters , but has been observed in all environments .",

    "all star - forming galaxies have been declining in unison ( for a given stellar mass ) since @xmath2812 , with little dependence on environment , this must be driven by processes inherent to galaxies as a population . @xcite and @xcite have argued that this cosmic decline in star formation is driven primarily by the parallel fall in the cosmological rate of baryonic accretion onto dark matter halos , which scales as @xmath29 at fixed halo mass @xcite .",
    "clusters and their member galaxies do not exist and evolve in isolation .",
    "clusters are located at the nodes of the filamentary network which makes up the large - scale structure of the universe , and have been continually accreting mass in the form of galaxies and galaxy groups from their surroundings .",
    "@xcite show that the accretion rate of galaxies onto clusters from their surroundings has been fairly uniform over the last 10gyr , the median time since accretion for a galaxy in a cluster at the present day being @xmath3045gyr .",
    "@xcite indicate that @xmath31050% of those galaxies accreted into massive clusters ( @xmath32 ) since @xmath33 arrived as members of galaxy groups rather than as isolated field galaxies .",
    "this implies that a significant number of star - forming spirals have been infalling onto clusters at late epochs ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "these must then be rapidly transformed by environmental processes , either in - situ or pre - processed within galaxy groups , in order to leave the present day clusters as devoid of star forming galaxies as observed .",
    "this late and continual accretion of galaxies into clusters leaves its imprint in the form of strong radial population gradients in the accretion epochs of galaxies .",
    "these can be modelled with cosmological simulations and have been successfully tuned to qualitatively reproduce the observed sf  density relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and constrain the time - scale required to transform galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "such a large statistical sample of clusters is mandatory to handle the large cluster - to - cluster scatter seen in their galaxy populations ( e.g. bo84 ) , resulting from the wide variations in the dynamical states and current mass accretion rates of massive clusters @xcite , a reflection of their dynamical immaturity .",
    "the different physical processes believed to contribute to the transformation of cluster galaxies act over a wide range of cluster - centric radii @xcite , necessitating panoramic datasets extending to the virial radius and beyond to provide any discriminatory power .",
    "moreover , mapping the large - scale structure in which each cluster is embedded is vital to understand how galaxy evolution is dependent on the hierarchical assembly of massive clusters .",

    "we found rapid evolution of the form @xmath39 , paralleling that seen in the original bo84 study .",
    "we then showed that this apparent rapid evolution was due primarily to the _ cosmic _ decline in star formation in field galaxies , which were accreted onto clusters at a constant rate and subsequently quenched by cluster related processes .",
    "the key limitation of paper i was that it was based on partial redshift information , coming primarily from the literature ( and hence varying dramatically from cluster to cluster ) , such that we had to rely on statistically accounting for the contribution from field galaxy interlopers when estimating the @xmath6 .",

    ", the galaxies in their high - density regions are predominately associated to galaxy groups rather than clusters , simply reflecting the observation that more than half of galaxies within the local universe are found in groups , while just a few percent are associated to massive clusters ( mcg09 ) .",
    "hence their sfr  density relations are defined primarily by environmental processes active within galaxy groups of mass @xmath171 .",
    "secondly , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite all use @xmath172 as a measure of local density , based on the distance to the fifth nearest @xmath173 galaxy within 1000kms@xmath10 , which as @xcite show is rather insensitive to the location of a galaxy within a galaxy group .",
    "while galaxies with high @xmath172 are almost all members of bound systems , the converse is not true , with group members found across the full range of @xmath172 .",
    "any systematic suppression in the sfrs of galaxies within groups or clusters will thus be smeared out when viewed in terms of the sfr@xmath172 relation .",
    "in contrast , by defining our environment in terms of @xmath174 , we are able to directly link the properties of the galaxies to their location within the dm halo of a massive cluster ( after accounting for projection effects ) or outside it , and measure the related impact of being accreted into the cluster halo on their star formation activity , something which can not be achieved using @xmath175 alone .    it is this combination of the type of survey used ( cluster - specific versus representative volume of the universe ) and the metric used to define local environment ( @xmath174 , versus local density , @xmath172 ) that likely lie behind the apparently inconsistent results presented here and in the previous studies described above .",
    "our results are also in agreement with @xcite who analysed the star formation activity of galaxies as a function of cluster - centric radius for 521 clusters at @xmath24 using sdss spectroscopic data . like us",
    ", they found that within @xmath3 the sfrs and specific - sfrs of star - forming cluster galaxies systematically decline towards the cluster core from the values seen in the field , while @xcite found similar trends for late - type galaxies in the vicinity of both coma and virgo clusters .",
    "by directly comparing the specific - sfrs of star - forming galaxies in clusters and the field at fixed redshift and stellar mass ( figs  [ ssfr_kmag ] and  [ quenching ] ) , we have been able to effectively isolate and quantify the impact of the cluster environment on star formation , having minimized any contribution from evolutionary or mass - dependent effects .",
    "while our estimates for @xmath102 are model dependent , the actual evidence for slow quenching in cluster galaxies is a clean , model - free result .",
    "the 0.72.0gyr range for @xmath102 we obtain here is consistent with recent estimates of @xmath83gyr for the _ total _ time required to transform an infalling star - forming galaxy into a passively - evolving ( @xmath176 ) cluster member ( mcg09 , mcg11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* del12 ) .",
    "we note that none of the latter estimates are based on direct observation of a _ quenching _ galaxy population within clusters , but rather by comparing the evolution or scatter in the fraction of passive / red galaxies ( @xmath177 ) within groups and clusters , with the predicted galaxy accretion histories of clusters obtained from cosmological simulations . in each case",
    ", these estimates assume that galaxies have become passive _ solely _ through environmental processes related to their accretion into a massive halo . mcg09 and mcg11 argue that the rapid increase in @xmath177 among group and cluster galaxies since @xmath15 is consistent with slow quenching on @xmath83gyr time - scales after being accreted into a @xmath171 halo . however , as we discuss in   [ sec : discussbo ] , a significant fraction of the decrease in @xmath6 in clusters since @xmath15 is due to the cosmic decline in star formation in all galaxies , while many cluster galaxies are also likely to have become passive due to internal mass - related mechanisms @xcite , such as agn feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these secular processes are also likely to contribute significantly to the low scatter in @xmath177 seen among groups and clusters by shutting down star formation in most massive galaxies irrespective of environment , and could plausibly explain the estimated values of @xmath178gyr and m@xmath179 obtained by @xcite .",
    "the cluster galaxy accretion history models used by all these studies only include model galaxies physically within @xmath3 of the halo center .",
    "however , as we estimate that about half of star - forming galaxies with @xmath119 spectroscopically identified as cluster members will in fact be physically located outside @xmath3 and have never encountered the cluster environment (   [ timescale ] ) , neglecting this contribution could significantly affect their @xmath102 estimates .",
    "this is particularly the case for the analysis of the radial population gradients of cluster galaxies by del12 , who argued that the steep gradients of @xmath177 with cluster - centric radius implied long quenching time - scales ( their fig .",
    "as the relative contribution of interloping galaxies physically outside @xmath3 increases rapidly with @xmath180 from @xmath70% at the cluster core to 100% by 23@xmath3 , these steep radial population gradients are in fact best reproduced by rapid or instantaneous quenching ( @xmath181 ) models ( e.g. fig  7 of paper i ) .",
    "@xcite use a similar approach to that presented here to estimate the quenching time - scale as a function of halo mass , by comparing the specific - sfr distributions of satellite and central galaxies . for cluster - mass halos of mass @xmath182 ,",
    "their data suggested a `` delayed - then - rapid '' form of quenching , in which a satellite can continue to form stars unaffected for @xmath83gyr , before undergoing a rapid quenching with e - folding time - scales of 0.20.8gyr .",
    "this rather different scenario came from them not finding any significant offset in the peak of the specific - sfr distribution of star - forming galaxies in clusters in comparisons to central ( field ) galaxies of the same stellar mass @xcite , although their fig .",
    "2 does hint at a slight offset of order 0.050.15dex for massive galaxies , similar to that revealed in our fig .",
    "[ ssfr_kmag ] .",
    "it is only by analysing such large samples of cluster galaxies as provided within locuss that we have been able to securely detect the subtle effect of slow quenching on star - forming galaxies within clusters .",
    "the fraction of lenticulars within groups and clusters has increased rapidly over the last 5gyr , rising from @xmath1610% in systems at @xmath183 to 5060% by the present day @xcite , empirically replacing the star - forming spirals . a key difficulty in explaining this conversion from spirals to s0s since @xmath33 is that s0s differ from spirals by having higher bulge luminosities rather than fainter disks @xcite .",
    "this requires bulge growth during s0 formation , disfavoring a simple fading of the disk component via gas removal mechanisms such as ram - pressure stripping or starvation .",
    "the simplest method of building up the bulges of cluster lenticulars is to invoke a starburst episode within the central regions of these galaxies , perhaps triggered by galaxy mergers or harassment .",
    "this should manifest itself in the form of significant numbers of starburst galaxies in and around clusters , as nuclear starbursts are triggered in the infall regions of clusters via galaxy interactions or as galaxies encounter the accretion shocks of the cluster s halo .",
    "if we identify starbursts as galaxies for which the specific - sfrs are @xmath184 above the median value of the main sequence of normal star forming field galaxies ( @xmath185yr@xmath10 ) at that redshift , then figure  [ ssfr_compare ] revealed conclusively that starburst galaxies with specific - sfrs @xmath186yr@xmath10 are essentially absent in cluster environments .",
    "indeed , focussing on the high side of the specific - sfr distribution ( @xmath187yr@xmath10 ) , the specific - sfr distributions of star forming galaxies in our cluster samples appear either entirely consistent with that of field galaxies at the same redshift or even marginally suppressed .",
    "the specific - sfr distributions of cluster galaxies presented in fig .",
    "[ ssfr_compare ] are consistent with @xcite who found that the vast majority of star formation in local clusters occurs within quiescent spiral disks , without any significant contribution from nuclear starbursts .",
    "if we require 3040% of cluster galaxies to be transformed from spirals to s0s over the last 5gyr via nuclear starbursts , then assuming a 100myr long starburst phase , would imply that @xmath70.60.8% of all cluster galaxies would be observed in this starburst phase at any given time . assuming initial stellar masses for these galaxies of 0.51.@xmath188 and requiring say 10% of this stellar mass to be produced via nuclear starburst in order to form the bulge , implies typical sfrs of @xmath1250100m@xmath9yr@xmath10 over this 100myr starburst period . over our full sample of 30 systems",
    "we have 5147 cluster members with @xmath7 covered by our 24@xmath1 m imaging , and so should expect to see 3040 such starbursts in our sample , or 12 per cluster .",
    "we see just four cluster members with sfrs greater than 40m@xmath9yr@xmath10 in our sample ( fig .",
    "it seems that if the bulges of the present day cluster s0s were formed in nuclear starbursts this activity must be largely have been confined to galaxy groups , which were later accreted onto the clusters ( pre - processing ) , or have taken place almost entirely in clusters at @xmath189 where at least such starbursts appear frequent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with @xcite who find that the rise in the s0 fraction since @xmath33 is much more rapid in groups and low-@xmath84 clusters than in massive clusters comparable to those in our sample .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the levels and evolution of star formation activity in a representative sample of 30 massive clusters at @xmath0 drawn from the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss ) .",
    "we have combined wide - field _",
    "spitzer_/mips 24@xmath1 m data sensitive to obscured sfrs @xmath303m@xmath9yr@xmath10 in the highest redshift systems with acres , our recently completed spectroscopic program , in order to obtain a highly complete census of obscured star formation in the virialized regions of these systems .",
    "our main results are summarized below :    1 .",
    "we determined the mid - infrared luminosity function of star - forming cluster galaxies for our full sample of 30 clusters extending down to @xmath190 .",
    "we find the infrared lf of cluster galaxies to be indistinguishable to that from a coeval population of field galaxies taken from the same _ spitzer _ images",
    "we combined our sample of 30 clusters with seven local systems and two clusters at @xmath15 to measure the mid - infrared butcher  oemler effect , finding rapid evolution in the fraction of massive ( @xmath7 ) cluster galaxies within @xmath88 with sfrs@xmath8m@xmath9yr@xmath10 , of the form over the redshift range 0.00.4 .",
    "we find an even more rapid evolution in the star formation activity of cluster lirgs , with a @xmath191 decline in @xmath192(sfr)/@xmath193 just since @xmath13 .",
    "the butcher  oemler effect is produced by the combination of a @xmath12 decline in the mean specific - sfrs of star - forming cluster galaxies since @xmath13 with a @xmath14 decrease in number density .",
    "two - thirds of this evolution in the specific - sfrs of star - forming cluster galaxies is due to the steady cosmic decline in star formation among all galaxies , but one - third reflects an accelerated decline in the star formation activity of cluster galaxies since @xmath13 with respect to that seen in the field .",
    "the specific - sfrs of star - forming cluster galaxies at @xmath115 are found to be systematically @xmath194% lower than their counterparts in the field at fixed stellar mass and redshift .",
    "this is consistent with these galaxies being slowly quenched upon arrival in the cluster , their sfrs declining exponentially on time - scales in the range 0.72.0gyr .",
    "such slow quenching is suggestive of ram - pressure stripping or starvation mechanisms .",
    "we find no evidence for a population of starburst galaxies being triggered by accretion into clusters of the kind proposed to transform infalling spirals into present day cluster s0s by building the stellar bulge with a major nuclear starburst episode .",

    "as discussed in  [ sec : field ] , a key requirement in this analysis is the availability of a statistical sample of field galaxies covering the same @xmath0 redshift range as the 30 clusters in our sample , which are selected in an _ identical _ manner , as well as coming from the same _ spitzer _ datasets which have uniform coverages from cluster to cluster . as we are attempting to measure rather subtle differences in the star - formation activities of cluster and field galaxies , any systematic mis - match in the stellar - mass or sfr distribution resulting from the selection criteria used to target galaxies for spectroscopy , even at the 1020% level , could dramatically impact these comparisons . to minimize any such biases ,",
    "we have taken great care in selecting field galaxies in narrow redshift slices either side of each cluster , for which the spectroscopic completeness should be indistinguishable from that obtained for the cluster galaxies themselves .",
    "there are two primary criteria used to select targets for spectroscopy which limit the redshift range either side of the cluster for which we should remain complete : the @xmath51-band apparent magnitude limit corresponding to @xmath195 at the cluster redshift ; and the width of the @xmath62 color slice about the c - m relation of each cluster used to maximize the observing efficiency of targeting cluster members .",
    "we discuss the impact of each one in turn .",
    "in figure  [ z_mk ] we plot @xmath196 versus redshift for each galaxy in our spectroscopic sample , with each cluster field shown as a separate panel .",
    "the maximal redshift range of the cluster is shown as the red shaded region , while the adjacent redshift ranges used to define our comparison field galaxy sample are indicated by green ( foreground field ) and blue ( background field ) shaded regions .",
    "galaxies spectroscopically identifed as belonging to these cluster and field samples are correspondingly shown as red , green or blue symbols , while black points indicate galaxies discarded from this analysis .",
    "note the presence of some black points within the cluster redshift range , these are discarded as non - cluster members by virtue of lying outside the cluster caustics .",
    "there are gaps apparent between the cluster and field redshift ranges for most of the systems , due to our exclusion of galaxies within 4000kms@xmath10 of the central cluster redshift from our field sample .",
    "the 4000kms@xmath10 velocity limit represents the maximal velocity offset for galaxies identified as cluster members , as seen for the most massive systems in our sample ( abell 1689 , abell 1835 , abell 2390 ) , and should ensure that any galaxy in our field sample is at least 50mpc from the cluster .",
    "within acres we targetted probable cluster galaxies down to a @xmath51-band apparent magnitude corresponding to @xmath197 ( _ horizontal dot - dashed line _ ) at the cluster redshift .",
    "as we look at field galaxies at redshifts either side of the cluster , this @xmath51-band apparent magnitude limit produces an effective absolute magnitude limit @xmath198 which systematically shifts to brighter values with increasing redshift , as shown by the sloping solid curves .",
    "we usually identify our upper redshift limit for selecting field galaxies ( right edge of blue shaded region ) as the point at which this curve reaches @xmath199 ( _ dashed lines _ ) , or our overall redshift limit of @xmath200 , whichever is lowest .",
    "two systems , abell 1689 and abell 1835 , have particularly extensive spectroscopy from @xcite which goes to much fainter magnitude limits than @xmath197 , allowing us to extend the redshift range over which we remain complete to @xmath199 .",
    "we have explicitly removed redshift ranges from our field sample that contain massive structures , including a @xmath201 cluster in the same field as abell 586 , and x - ray groups identified from our _ xmm _ imaging , such as the two foreground groups at @xmath202 identified in the fields of abell 267 and abell 291 .",
    "it is notable that even in our `` field '' regions structures and voids in redshift - space are apparent in fig .",
    "[ z_mk ] . in the case of abell 1758 for example",
    ", we see clear foreground structures at @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "we have visually checked the spatial distribution of galaxies from each of these structures on the plane of the sky , and confirm that they are mostly extended filamentary structures , none of which are associated to extended x - ray structures detected in our _ xmm _ images .    in an analogous way",
    ", we determined the redshift limits imposed by our @xmath62 color cuts by plotting the @xmath206 color offset of each galaxy from the c - m relation versus redshift for each cluster .",
    "as the @xmath62 color of galaxies increases steadily with redshift ( at fixed stellar mass and hubble type ) , the vast majority of galaxies are found to lie within a single well - defined diagonal band ( @xmath207 at @xmath115 ) in this plot .",
    "the intercept of this diagonal band with our color cuts then defines the redshift range over which our spectroscopic survey should remain complete .",
    "the color cuts for each cluster were asymmetically spaced with respect to the c - m relation of that cluster , the upper color cut being located further from the c - m relation than the lower one .",
    "the resulting redshift limits are thus also asymmetrically offset from the cluster redshift , with typically the redshift range extending to @xmath208100.15 beyond the cluster , but just @xmath209050.10 to lower redshifts .",
    "for each cluster , our final upper redshift limit for our field sample was ultimately defined by the requirement of remaining complete to @xmath199 , this being the more stringent requirement than that imposed by the color cuts .",
    "the final lower redshift limit for our field sample for each cluster was defined by our lower @xmath62 color cut ."
