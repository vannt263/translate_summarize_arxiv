    "high - resolution x - ray spectral observations from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "offer a new tool with which to study the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the ism affects x - ray spectra in two ways : photoelectric absorption , particularly at low energies ( 0.110  kev ) , and scattering by dust grains , producing x - ray halos . at x - ray energies , absorption features are primarily from the excitation and ionization of inner - shell ( @xmath0-shell ) electrons , although for high-@xmath6 elements like iron , @xmath1-shell absorption edges are also detectable .",
    "measurements of the ism absorption features in the spectra of x - ray binaries allow us to study the abundances and ionization fractions for a large number of elements , analogous to optical and ultraviolet observations of stars that measure ism absorption features .",
    "additionally , high - resolution x - ray spectral measurements provide a new method for determining the elemental depletion of the ism and composition of interstellar dust .",
    "the first attempt to measure ism absorption edges in the x - rays used the _ einstein _",
    "focal plane crystal spectrometer @xcite and found evidence for the @xmath3-@xmath4 ( @xmath7 ) absorption resonance and a possible edge .",
    "recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ results have revealed more complex structure around the oxygen @xmath0-shell absorption edge ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "all of the high - resolution work points to a complex system of absorption features at or near the oxygen edge , which is not the simple step function used in absorption models .",
    "similar high - resolution structure is expected at all of the absorption edges .",
    "previous results from _ einstein _ and _ exosat _ grating observations of the bright low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) sco x-1 point to an underabundance of oxygen and an overabundance of nitrogen along the line of sight to the source @xcite .",
    "similarly , using the abundances of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath8 ) , @xcite found that the spectrum of the crab pulsar was best - fit when oxygen was underabundant .",
    "when the newer abundances of ( * ? ?",
    "* @xmath9 ) were used , oxygen was not required to be underabundant , although a slightly lower than nominal oxygen abundance was preferred , @xmath10 .",
    "we note that the measurement of the oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen is misleading since the x - ray band can not directly measure the hydrogen column density . instead , the measurement is relative to the absorption from other metals which are converted to an equivalent hydrogen column density using standard abundances .",
    "@xcite compared the oxygen and neon column densities measured in the x - ray to the hydrogen column density from radio observations along the line of sight to cyg x-2 .",
    "both the neon and oxygen abundances were found to be @xmath11 the solar abundances of @xcite but in line with newer estimates of ism abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , @xcite found an overabundance relative to oxygen for magnesium , silicon , sulfur , and possibly iron ( assuming solar abundance ratios from * ? ? ? * ) in the ism absorption along the line of sight to three bright neutron star lmxbs .",
    "while many x - ray binaries have absorption which is well described by standard abundances , some systems have shown unusual abundance ratios which have been attributed to material local to these systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , an accurate measurement of the relative abundances along many lines of sight is necessary in order to interpret data for sources which show unusual abundance ratios .",
    "we also mention a new result that found a significantly larger ne / o ratio than in standard solar or ism models . using the x - ray emission lines from nearby solar - like stars",
    ", @xcite found an average ne / o ratio of 0.41 , or 2.7 times greater than the standard ism or solar abundances .",
    "if the sun has a similar ne / o ratio then this would solve the solar helioseismology problem ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we note that this work has sparked some controversy and claims of smaller ne / o ratios in the sun were quickly made @xcite . in either case , it is not readily apparent that solar coronal measurements should equal the ism abundances .",
    "it was recognized early in the history of x - ray spectroscopy that the composition of dust grains could be probed by spectroscopic measurements of absorption edges @xcite .",
    "absorption edges from molecules include x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) due to the influence of nearby atoms on the absorption process @xcite .",
    "such features would distinguish between the molecular and atomic contributions to the edge structure .",
    "in addition , the resonance structure of the absorption edges is expected to be shifted , relative to the atomic position , in molecular absorption edges due to the molecular binding energy .",
    "the edges from magnesium , silicon , and iron are expected to be dominated by contributions from molecular , as opposed to atomic , forms given the high levels of depletion measured ( @xmath12% ) , while carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen are only mildly depleted ( @xmath13% ; * ? ? ?",
    "several authors have claimed detection of the @xmath3-@xmath4 transition in iron oxides @xcite , although we showed that this resonance coincides with the @xmath3-@xmath4 transition from making the identification of iron oxides debatable ( paper i ) .",
    "@xcite claimed a tentative detection of xafs in the silicon absorption edge of the x - ray binary grs  1915@xmath14105 .",
    "similarly @xcite claimed that the silicon and magnesium edges in the spectra of three lmxbs show xafs consistent with the expected structure from silicates .",
    "in addition , depletion of elements in grains can reduce the effective cross - section for absorption due to screening ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this effect will lead to deviations in the measured abundances from the true interstellar values .",
    "along with neutral and molecular absorption edges , features from ionized species are also expected .",
    "we showed that low ionization lines from oxygen are found in the spectra of a number of x - ray binaries ( paper i ) . from these lines ,",
    "a measurement of the large - scale ionization fraction of oxygen in the ism is made .",
    "@xcite identified and absorption lines in the spectra of two black - hole x - ray binaries .",
    "they attributed these to material local to the systems , although such lines may arise in the ism similar to the oxygen lines .",
    "highly ionized lines may also be expected from the hot ionized phase of the ism .",
    "@xcite claim the detection of an absorption line in the spectrum of the lmxb 4u  1820@xmath1530 , which they attribute to the hot ism .",
    "recently , @xcite detected absorption in the spectra of a number of lmxbs .",
    "low - ionization lines can be used to better understand the relationship between the warm ionized and warm neutral phases of the ism .",
    "the high - ionization features in galactic lmxbs probe the hot ionized phase of the ism and have direct implications for the detection of @xmath16 highly ionized oxygen and neon absorption features in the spectra of quasars , which have been claimed to be due to the local group warm - hot intergalactic medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or alternatively a hot galactic corona @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we study the absorption edges of neon ( @xmath0-shell ) and iron ( @xmath1-shell ) in nine bright x - ray binaries .",
    "these edges are most prominent in systems with galactic hydrogen column densities of @xmath17@xmath18  @xmath19 . many of the x - ray binaries used in this work were also part of the oxygen edge study , allowing us to measure the relative abundances of oxygen , iron , and neon",
    ". these elements also sample a variety of expected depletion levels : neon should have no depletion , oxygen is mildly depleted , and iron is heavily depleted .",
    "we will look for signatures of depletion by comparing the abundance ratios of the elements .",
    "finally , we will measure the ionization of neon , using the identified low- and high - ionization absorption features .",
    "in paper i , we presented an overview of the basic atomic physics necessary to understand @xmath0-shell absorption in the x - ray band .",
    "we defer the reader to the discussion presented there and focus in the following specifically on the iron @xmath1-shell and neon @xmath0-shell absorption edges .    the iron edge located at 17.5",
    " is due to the excitation and ionization of @xmath1-shell ( @xmath20 ) electrons .",
    "the high - resolution structure of the edge is resolved into three distinct edges , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath21 edge at 14.7   , due to transitions from the @xmath24 level , is the weakest of the edges and we neglect it in our study since our data are not sensitive enough to measure this absorption .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 edges , due to transitions from the @xmath25 and @xmath26 levels , are located at 17.2 and 17.5   , respectively ( see table  [ tab : theory ] and figure  [ fig : cross ] ) .",
    "to model the cross - section from fe-@xmath1 , we use the measurement of metallic iron by @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the @xcite cross - section with lower - resolution determinations @xcite finds that the values compare to within 15% at a wavelength of 16.8   , where the high - resolution structure is no longer a factor .",
    "other analyses have found that the @xcite measurement reproduces the high - resolution structure of the iron edge quite well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we expect the cross - section from iron in dust to differ in two important aspects .",
    "first , the shape and position of the edge can differ depending on the binding of iron within a molecule .",
    "the two most common forms of iron in molecules are ferrous ( fe@xmath27 ) and ferric ( fe@xmath28 ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies of the fe-@xmath1 edge reveal that the position of the @xmath23 edge varies from 17.517   for ferrous iron to 17.475   for ferric iron @xcite .",
    "molecules with a mix of the two forms show a double - peaked profile .",
    "the @xmath22 edge position and structure also varies @xcite .",
    "olivines , a favored form of interstellar dust ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contains pure ferrous iron .",
    "iron oxides can contain ferrous ( feo ) , ferric ( fe@xmath29o@xmath30 ) , or ferrous ferric iron ( fe@xmath30o@xmath31 ) , depending on the composition .",
    "therefore , determination of the position and shape of the @xmath23 edge can yield information on the composition of interstellar dust .",
    "the second difference is the strength of the cross - section for absorption . in grains ,",
    "the optical depth can be large ( @xmath321 ) , therefore absorption will occur primarily on the surface .",
    "atoms located in the inner regions of the grains are shielded by the outer layers .",
    "this produces a net reduction in the cross - section for elements located in dust grains .",
    "we have estimated this effect for iron , following the description in @xcite , and find that the cross - section for absorption of iron in dust grains is 88% of the cross - section for gaseous iron .",
    "we note that this calculation requires a number of assumptions , including the relative abundances and depletions of the interstellar elements ( see appendix  [ app : a ] ) .",
    "a more detailed study of these assumptions is presented in section  [ sec : feabund ] .",

    "narrow features easily detectable by _ chandra _ can be substantially washed out by the rgs resolution .",
    "we therefore claim that the low - ionization neon features in gx  339@xmath154 are completely consistent with an interstellar origin .",

    "the derivation of the cross - section for dust grains presented in @xcite includes the contribution of all elements . for our data ,",

    "@xmath122 can be directly related to the element column density @xmath123 by @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the ism abundance of element @xmath6 .",

    "we consider only the contribution of element @xmath6 to @xmath120 , remembering that element @xmath6 makes up only part of the total mass of the grains .",
    "we find @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the mass density of element @xmath6 in interstellar grains and @xmath130 is the atomic mass .",
    "the mass density @xmath129 is related to the total grain mass density @xmath131 by @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the depletion fraction of element @xmath6 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath129 takes into account the contribution of all other elements to the total dust content of the ism .          the grain optical depth @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the column density of element @xmath6 found in grains .",
