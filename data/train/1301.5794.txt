    "a complete understanding of microscale plasticity is important both for fundamental and technological reasons , and much experimental and theoretical effort has been expended on this problem in recent years .",
    "a key result that has emerged  and that is not intuitively obvious from our everyday experience of classical bulk plasticity  is that on the microscale plastic flow is subject to size effects , with recent experiments showing that in submicron samples , the yield stress increases with decreasing sample size  @xcite .",
    "however , the origins of these finite size effects are not clear , and many mechanisms have been proposed ( for reviews , see refs  @xcite ) .    in typical experimental studies ,",
    "the yield stress is determined from measured stress - strain curves by defining a yield strain @xmath1 , typically a few percent , and reading off the stress required to attain such a strain .",
    "this procedure suffers from the fact that measured stress - strain curves are not smooth and the transition to plastic yield is generally preceded by power law distributed avalanches  @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of how the yield strain should be selected to ensure that the measured yield stress is not systematically over- or under - estimated in a way that affects finite size scaling .",
    "furthermore , it is not _ a priori _ clear that one can compare experimental results in which different threshold strains have been used , making it difficult to synthesize results from different studies .    in this paper",
    ", we approach this problem from a theoretical perspective , by studying numerical simulations of @xmath0 dimensional depinning at zero temperature .",
    "this is the simplest model for plastic yielding in a crystal : the interface represents a dislocation , driven through a random potential generated by disorder and other dislocations in the sample .",
    "depinning has previously been studied in a variety of contexts , using both numerical and analytical techniques  @xcite , and it is well - known that there exists a critical driving force @xmath2 , above which the interface is depinned and has finite velocity always , and below which the interface will always come to a stop at long times .",
    "this transition is analogous to plastic yielding , in which stresses above a finite threshold are able to induce large strain increases that ideally are limited only by sample failure .    like other phase transitions ,",
    "the depinning transition is subject to finite size effects , so that the depinning force in a system of linear size @xmath3 has the asymptotic form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the depinning force in the limit @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the finite size exponent , determined by the universality class of the model .",
    "a key question that this work aims to address is whether the observed finite size scaling is affected by how the depinning transition is measured .",
    "in particular , we can imitate the experimental procedure for measuring yield stress by mapping our simulations of interface depinning onto plots of stress _ vs _ plastic strain from stress controlled experiments .",
    "the motion of a dislocation with burgers vector @xmath8 over distance @xmath9 in a system of size @xmath10 results in a strain increase of @xmath11 , and the driving force is proportional to an external stress . we can therefore consider a plot of the mean position of the interface _ vs _ driving force to represent plastic strain _ vs _ stress , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ stressstrain](a ) . in analogy to the approach taken in experimental analysis , we define a target displacement @xmath12 to define the onset of depinning , and study the effects of varying this target . in what follows",
    ", we will measure lengths in units of @xmath8 .",
    "we note that this approach to measure the depinning threshold raises another issue .",
    "it has previously been pointed out  @xcite that in a simulation of a system of finite size @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions in both directions , a `` natural '' choice of @xmath14 is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the interface roughness exponent and @xmath17 gives the interface width at criticality . in this way , one ensures that for all @xmath3 , the system contains the same number of critical configurations . on the other hand",
    ", our target scales as @xmath10 , so although it is natural for the plasticity scenario at hand , the system aspect ratios increase with @xmath3 .",
    "we will see that this affects the distribution of measured depinning forces , as anticipated  @xcite .",
    "the depinning models can also be related to strain - controlled experiments , by driving the interface via a spring of stiffness @xmath18 , and adjusting the externally - applied stress so that the total strain  the elastic strain of the spring , partially relieved by the plastic deformation arising from interface motion  increases smoothly .",
    "the set - up and a typical stress - strain curve are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ stressstrain](b ) . again in this context , we study the effect of the choice of yield strain on measured yield stress , and discuss how these effects can be related to strain hardening in a stress controlled experiment .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ ew ] ,",
    "we use the quenched edwards - wilkinson model for interface depinning as a case study for the role of target choice on measured properties , considering not only the finite size scaling of the mean depinning force but also how the choice of target affects its whole distribution .",
    "the ideas developed in section  [ ew ] are independent of universality class , which we demonstrate in section  [ mfsect ] via results from the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) model and a mean field model .",
    "finally , in section  [ hardening ] we discuss two closely - related extensions to the quenched edwards - wilkinson model , namely strain hardening and the above - mentioned strain controlled experiments .",
    "we show that finite size effects in these models are more complex than in the other models we study , depending on both the finite size scaling of the depinning force and also the hardening amplitude or stiffness of the coupled spring .    , _ vs _ mean interface displacement , @xmath19 ) curves from simulations of the quenched edwards - wilkinson equation , with ( circles ) and without ( triangles ) hardening . the black solid line indicates the @xmath20 behavior of the model with hardening as @xmath21 ( see section  [ hardening ] ) .",

    "@xmath24 is determined by selecting a yield strain @xmath25 and reading off the stress required to attain it . ]",
    "we start by considering a simple linear model for the interplay between elasticity , random pinning and an external drive , namely , the quenched edwards - wilkinson model  @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to discern the effect of the choice of target interface displacement in a straight - forward manner , giving results that will aid the interpretation of more complex models that follow .    in general , an overdamped elastic interface characterized by height function @xmath26 and subject to a random potential and a uniform external drive @xmath27",
    "is described by overdamped equations of motion    @xmath28    where the damping constant @xmath29 is hereafter set to unity .",
    "the self - interaction of the interface , @xmath30 , promotes it to be flat , and may be local or long - range , depending on the model at hand .",
    "the self - interaction is in competition with the quenched disorder @xmath31 , which causes the interface to prefer to pass through sites with low potential energy . in the quenched edwards - wilkinson model that we study in this section ,",
    "the elastic force at position @xmath9 on the line is given by @xmath32 .",
    "in this work , we study a cellular automaton version of this model , by discretizing @xmath9 and @xmath33 .",
    "the elastic force is given by @xmath34 .",
    "we allow only forward motion of the interface : at each simulation step , a site @xmath9 may increase @xmath35 by one unit if the total force acting on it is positive , or remain stationary if the force is zero or negative .",
    "the random potential is implemented by drawing a random number for each @xmath36 . in general , these are from a uniform distribution over @xmath37 $ ] , but in section  [ mfsect ] we will also study gaussian distributed disorder , because when all sites are coupled to one another , the disorder distribution can be important  @xcite .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath9 direction , and open boundary conditions in the @xmath33 direction .    in order to generate `` stress - strain '' curves in a stress - controlled simulation , we start with a flat interface with @xmath38 everywhere and @xmath39 .",
    "we increase the drive @xmath27 adiabatically , by finding the site @xmath40 with the smallest required driving force for motion , and increasing @xmath27 so that @xmath40 can move .",
    "this may trigger an avalanche via changes in @xmath30 , and we update sites in parallel until no more can move .",
    "we record the value of @xmath27 and the mean position of the interface attained after it has stopped moving , and then increase the drive again . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the record of driving forces and mean interface positions is the `` stress - strain '' curve , since the motion of a dislocation by distance @xmath9 increases the plastic strain by @xmath41 ( we work in units where the burgers vector @xmath8 is unity ) .",
    "we continue to increase the drive until the mean interface position passes the target @xmath42 .",
    "the driving force required for the target to be attained is denoted @xmath2 , and for simplicity we will call it a `` depinning '' threshold , even if this is not strictly accurate .",

    "figure  [ qew](a ) shows the mean force required for the interface to attain the target mean position @xmath42 , as a function of system linear size @xmath3 , for a range of @xmath47 values between @xmath52 and @xmath46 . in the large-@xmath3 limit , we find that @xmath53 approaches @xmath54 according to @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , in agreement with previous studies of finite size scaling  @xcite .",
    "however , for small @xmath3 , a distinct @xmath47 dependence becomes apparent : for small @xmath47 , @xmath2 initially grows with @xmath3 , but for large @xmath47 , @xmath53 decreases monotonically .",
    "this result can be understood by considering that there are two length scales in the direction of interface propagation .",
    "the first is the interface width at depinning , which is given by @xmath57 , with the roughness exponent @xmath58 for the quenched edwards - wilkinson equation  @xcite and @xmath59 a constant .",

    "the two length scales are equal when @xmath60 giving a crossover length scale @xmath61 .    if @xmath62 , the target is shorter than the interface width at criticality , and the simulation is halted during the early stages of interface motion , before the depinning transition can occur . in this regime , increasing @xmath3  and thereby the target  should increase the final driving force applied before the simulation is stopped . on the other hand , for @xmath63 , we can expect the interface to undergo the depinning transition , and the standard finite size scaling of eq",

    "we can go beyond the moments of the distribution of @xmath2 to consider the distribution itself .",
    "it has previously been shown  @xcite that the distribution of @xmath2 measured in a finite sample of size @xmath74 ( with open boundary conditions in the @xmath14 direction ) depends on the ratio of @xmath14 to the interface width @xmath57 .",

    "for example , in the kpz model  @xcite , where the elastic force @xmath86 is supplemented by a nonlinear term proportional to @xmath87 , we measure a roughness exponent of @xmath81 ( consistent with other measurements  @xcite ) and a finite size exponent of @xmath88 . per eq .  , @xmath53 curves for different @xmath47 can be collapsed via the rescaling @xmath89 , @xmath90 , as shown in fig .",

    "heuristically , this can be understood by considering that as @xmath94 increases , so does the forward force on sites lagging behind the mean interface position , so that the external driving force needs only be able to overcome the local pinning force on a few sites to start a large avalanche .",

    "finally , we discuss two related scenarios : strain hardening and strain - controlled experiments . in materials subject to hardening , the external stress required to induce plastic deformation grows with the plastic strain . a simple model for this can be incorporated into the model for interface depinning , by adding a force term that is opposed to the interface motion , and proportional to the strain associated with the interface displacement , @xmath103 , where @xmath19 is the average of @xmath35 over @xmath9 .",
