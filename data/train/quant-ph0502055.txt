    "the binary adder channel is a popular and well  studied example of a multiple access channel in classical information theory : @xmath0 senders may each choose a bit @xmath1 , which results in the receiver getting @xmath2 i.e. ,  the receiver can have only very limited information on the sent bits : e.g.  if @xmath3 she knows that exactly one @xmath4 equals @xmath5 , the others being @xmath6 , but has no information on @xmath7 .",
    "it is easily seen that this channel ( which remarkably is deterministic ) is equivalent to the channel randomly permuting the bits @xmath8 : in one direction , from such a random permutation the receiver can still calculate the sum @xmath9 of the bits , thus simulating the output of the former channel . in the other direction ,",
    "@xmath9 can be used to generate a uniform distribution on the words @xmath8 with weight @xmath9 , which is a simulation of the latter channel .",
    "the general expression for the capacity region of multiple access channels , as determined by ahlswede  @xcite , can be evaluated explicitly ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and gives for the two  user case @xmath10 ( to which we shall restrict our attention for the moment ) the achievable rate pairs @xmath11 of non  negative reals @xmath12 , @xmath13 with @xmath14 for asymptotic block coding .",
    "this result is obtained by random coding arguments and it is still an open problem to construct codes achieving these bounds . especially the zero  error case received much attention , and we refer to the survey  @xcite , and to  @xcite as the most recent contribution .",
    "there is also a literature on low  error codes : see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the above reasoning on the adder channel makes it plausible to define the _ quantum binary adder channel _ as follows : it has inputs @xmath0 qubits , i.e.  states on two  dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and acts as random permuter of these qubits ( for thoughts on the general methodology of quantum information theory we refer the reader to  @xcite )",
    ". formally , define for a permutation @xmath17 the permuting operators on @xmath18 by @xmath19 and let the adder channel @xmath20 be the following completely positive , trace preserving ( _ c.p.t.p .",
    "_ ) map on @xmath21 : @xmath22 to send classical information via this channel the senders will choose input qubits to their systems , while the receiver will choose a measurement , described by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) .",
    "for example the senders could choose to send only states from the fixed basis @xmath23 , and the receiver performing the von neumann measurement consisting of the projectors @xmath24 this obviously reproduces the behaviour of the classical adder channel , making @xmath20 a generalization of the former .",
    "however , we shall be concerned also with the effect of entanglement on the transmission capacity of this channel : in this case we assume that the senders and the receiver share initially some multipartite entangled state , and sending information is by the senders modifying their respective share of this state @xmath25 by applying quantum operations ( i.e. , c.p.t.p .",
    "maps ) and subsequently putting it into @xmath20 .",
    "the details of these procedures are discussed more precisely below , but we can remark that the channel proposed is an example of a _ quantum multiple access channel _ : the first who appeared to have discussed the model are allahverdyan and saakian  @xcite .",
    "the capacity region in full was determined in  @xcite ( the result being reproduced in  @xcite for the particular case of _ pure _ signal states ) , in the model of _ product state encodings _ ( i.e. the same condition under which the holevo bound holds and is achieved with single  user channels  @xcite ) .",
    "the result , for the two  sender case to which we shall restrict ourselves from here on , is as follows : suppose user @xmath5 may take actions @xmath26 , user @xmath27 actions @xmath28 , which results in the ( possibly mixed ) output state @xmath29 on hilbert space @xmath30 .",
    "this is a very general description of a quantum multiple access channel , which obviously includes the ones discussed above ( with or without entanglement ) .",
    "we assume that the channel acts _ memoryless _ , meaning that in @xmath31 uses of the channel , with inputs @xmath32 and @xmath33 the output state will be @xmath34    an _",
    "@xmath35block code _ for this channel is defined as a triple @xmath36 , with two functions @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 being finite sets of messages ) , and a decoding povm @xmath40 , such that the ( average ) error probability @xmath41 is at most @xmath42 .",
    "the _ capacity region _",
    "@xmath43 is then defined as the set of all pairs @xmath11 such that there exist @xmath35block codes with the error probability @xmath42 tending to zero , and the code rates tending to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , as @xmath44 : @xmath45 note that in this paper @xmath46 is the logarithm to basis @xmath27 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath30 is finite , so we might take @xmath47 , @xmath48 to be finite , too .",
    "however , allowing general measure spaces and measures @xmath49 on @xmath47 , @xmath50 on @xmath48 , and a measurable map @xmath51 does not change the result , but allows greater flexibility .    [",
    "thm : qmac : cap ] denote by @xmath52 the set of points @xmath53 such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 then the capacity region of the channel is given by the closed convex hull of the union of the @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath56    here the information terms are quantum , as follows : @xmath57 with the von neumann entropy @xmath58 , and @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the single  user classical  quantum channel conditional on @xmath61 : @xmath62 and likewise @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "observe the formal analogy of this formula to the classical case , where there appear mutual information and conditional mutual information , too  @xcite .",
    "we will use this formula to prove in the sequel ( section  [ sec : noent ] ) that the capacity region of @xmath20 , with no entanglement available , coincides with the region for the classical two  adder channel , described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical : adder : cap ] ) .",
    "this we shall take as the final piece of evidence that our definition really represents _ the _ quantum generalization of the classical adder channel .",
    "then we add entanglement to our investigation : in section  [ sec : uuent ] the enlargement of the capacity region due to entanglement between the senders is investigated , while we allow sender  receiver entanglement in section  [ sec : uurent ] , increasing the capacity region once more , the latter effect of course being reminiscent of dense coding  @xcite .",
    "to explain , however , the increase of the capacity due to entanglement between the senders , we have to understand the particular kind of correlation provided by it : in this direction , we discuss in the appendix the easy fact that shared randomness between all of the parties does not increase the capacity region of the classical adder channel ( in fact , this is even true for the quantum adder channel @xmath20 ) .",
    "so , the observed increase of the capacity has to be attributed to quantum effects .    to end this introduction , a few words on previous and related work : in  @xcite , final section ,",
    "some remarks regarding entanglement between the users are made . however , as this paper is only concerned with the pure state case of multiple access coding , there is no overlap with the present work .",
    "two further works have come to our attention that touch upon the peculiar `` interference '' ( mutual disturbance ) between messages in a multiple access channel , both in a situation where previous entanglement between two senders and the receiver is assumed , and a noiseless channel is considered ( instead of our noisy random permuter ) : in  @xcite , rather unaware of the information theoretic meaning , the case of 1ebit of sender ",
    "receiver entanglement in the form of a ghz  state is treated , in a noiseless setting : in section 3.2 .",
    "of that work it is shown that the rate ",
    "sum @xmath65 is optimal .",
    "there is overlap with this work concerning the idea of generalized superdense coding , compare subsection  [ subsec:1ebit ] .    in",
    "@xcite this investigation is carried to @xmath66level @xmath67party higher ghz  states , and coding methods meeting the capacity region bounds ( which can be derived from theorem  [ thm : qmac : cap ] ) are discussed .",
    "these are the channels we are going to investigate in the sequel : + fix an initial pure state @xmath68 of the system @xmath69 , where @xmath70 are the two users qubit systems ( with fixed orthonormal basis @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) , and @xmath73 is the receiver s system ( one may obviously assume that @xmath74 , as the initial state is always pure ) . as sets of allowed actions",
    "we define all local quantum operations : @xmath75 the channel @xmath20 for two senders has the simple form @xmath76 with the flip operator @xmath77 notice that a most convenient eigenbasis of this unitary is provided by the _ bell states _ @xmath78 the first three ( which span the _ symmetric subspace _",
    "@xmath79 ) with phase @xmath80 , the last with phase @xmath81 . from this one can see that the effect of @xmath20 is to destroy coherence between @xmath79 and @xmath82 : it is equivalent to an incomplete nondemolition von neumann measurement of the projector onto @xmath79 and its complement @xmath83 .",
    "the swap super ",
    "operator for density operators is defined as follows : for a density operator @xmath84 on @xmath85 let @xmath86 this means that the channel `` quantum binary adder with prior entanglement @xmath68 '' is described by mapping @xmath87 , @xmath88 to the output state @xmath89    making indistinguishable permutations of the input qubits surely is a necessary requirement for a candidate quantum adder channel , as well as reducing to the classical binary adder for the particular choice of input bases and output measurement ( both of which @xmath20 satisfies ) .",
    "notice however that @xmath20 even keeps coherence in the symmetric subspace @xmath79 .",
    "just as well one could destroy it by doing a nondemolition measurement in this or some other basis after @xmath20 . nevertheless , apart from being hard to motivate ( which basis to choose ? ) , this is an unnecessary `` classicalisation '' of the channel : as we shall see in the next section our definition of quantum adder channel has the same capacity region as the classical adder channel .",
    "we might take this as saying that @xmath20 is the `` most quantumly '' channel generalizing the usual binary adder channel and at the same time not increasing the capacity region .",
    "here we treat the case of a trivial receiver s system @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "thus coding amounts to independent choices of states @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 may be identified with the sets of pure states on @xmath94 , respectively ( note that choosing mixed states to encode is obviously suboptimal here ) .",
    "we will show that the capacity region in this case is identical to the classical adder channel s . to do this",
    ", we obviously have only to prove that our quantum channel obeys the same upper rate bounds as the classical one ( because the classical coding schemes work identically for the quantum channel ) .",
    "because the individual bounds on @xmath12 and @xmath13 are convex combinations of quantities trivially upper bounded by @xmath5 , we have only to show that @xmath95 , which in turn will follow if we show that @xmath96 for all distributions @xmath49 and @xmath50 on the pure qubit states . in more extensive writing",
    "this means @xmath97 it is an easy exercise to show that for two vectors @xmath98 with @xmath99 , one has @xmath100 with the shannon entropy of a binary distribution at the right hand side .    applied to the terms in the second integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) we get @xmath101 introducing @xmath102 we can rewrite the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) as @xmath103 now an important observation comes in : the function @xmath104 , for @xmath105 , is strictly concave and strictly decreasing , with value @xmath5 at @xmath106 and value @xmath6 at @xmath107 . in particular @xmath108 but",
    "taylor expansion shows even more : @xmath109 plugging this in we can lower bound the subtraction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) by @xmath110 thus we get an upper bound on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) : @xmath111 the maximum of this expression is obtained when @xmath112 and @xmath113 commute , in fact if they are equal : replacing both @xmath112 and @xmath113 by @xmath114 increases both the entropy contribution ( because of subadditivity ) , and the trace contribution : @xmath115 but with commuting @xmath112 , @xmath113 the situation is essentially the classical one , and we are done .",
    "more precisely , @xmath116 may be taken as distribution on a common eigenbasis @xmath117 of @xmath118 , in which case the maximum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : upper : noent ] ) is easily seen to be attained at @xmath119 : when @xmath118 the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : upper : noent ] ) becomes @xmath120 in terms of @xmath121 s eigenvalues @xmath122 this reads , and can be estimated , as @xmath123 the latter clearly obtaining the maximum at @xmath124 .",
    "observe that in this case only @xmath125 or @xmath126 occur with positive probability in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , so in eq .",
    "( [ eq : upper : noent ] ) we have in fact _ equality _ : the points in this region can be achieved by using the classical input states @xmath117 , the corresponding povm @xmath127 followed by a classical postprocessing ( decoding ) .",
    "observe that we can not , however , provide explicit code constructions to do this , as was pointed out in the introduction .",
    "up to basis change the most general two  qubit ( pure ) state that can be shared among the senders is @xmath128 with @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "before we go into the general case , we consider the two extremes :    _ 1 . no entanglement _ : @xmath131 ( meaning no entanglement ) was treated in the previous section , and the capacity region determined .",
    "_ 2 . maximal entanglement _ : on the other hand , for @xmath132 ( maximal entanglement ) , the upper bounds from theorem  [ thm : qmac : cap ] are trivially bounded by @xmath27 , each ; @xmath133 .",
    "as it turns out , this _ is _ the capacity region .",
    "for example , the corner @xmath134 is achieved by sender two sending nothing , while sender one modulates @xmath68 as in dense coding .",
    "note that the four bell  states are invariant under the channel , so the @xmath27 bits encoded by sender one are recovered without error .",
    "this is a notable feature , as we pointed out the difficulty of finding error  free codes for the unassisted adder channel .",
    "now we approach the general case : one strategy which seems to be good is to ( asymptotically reversibly ! ) concentrate the @xmath31 copies of the state @xmath68 into @xmath135 many epr pairs  @xcite",
    ". then use time sharing between @xmath136 uses of the maximal entanglement scheme ( item 2 above ) and @xmath137 uses of the no entanglement scheme ( item 1 above ) , resulting in an achievable rate region cut out by the inequalities @xmath138 the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : uue - r ] ) , @xmath139 is easily seen to be actually an upper bound on any achievable individual rate : indeed , let the second sender cooperate optimally , by sending all his entanglement to the receiver .",
    "then , even disregarding the channel noise , the maximal entanglement between the first sender and the receiver is @xmath140 , and it is fairly easy to show that under these circumstances sending @xmath31 qubits ( again disregarding the noise ) can transmit at most an asymptotic rate of @xmath139 classical bits  @xcite .    in view of this , we also conjecture that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : uue - rr ] ) , @xmath141 , is always an upper bound on the rate sum .",
    "a proof of this , however , has eluded us so far .",
    "we shall study two cases of entanglement between senders and receiver , both distinguished by their symmetry : the case of a shared ghz  state in subsection  [ subsec:1ebit ] , and the case of maximal entanglement in subsection  [ subsec:2ebits ] .      here",
    "the parties share initially a ghz ",
    "state @xmath142    note that this is the unique three  qubit state ( up to local unitaries ) having all its single particle states equal to the maximally mixed state .",
    "now , we shall prove that the region described by the inequalities @xmath143 is indeed the full capacity region : the individual rate bounds are obvious again , so we have only to bound the rate ",
    "we begin again with considering the unitary case : let the users employ unitaries @xmath144 ( global phases do not matter ) . with the flip unitary @xmath145 from above ,",
    "it is a straightforward calculation to obtain @xmath146 thus we can estimate ( with @xmath147 ) @xmath148 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "we will employ the following important inequality :    [ lemma : inequality ] for a general state @xmath121 on the composite system @xmath149 and a povm @xmath150 on @xmath151 , it holds for the measurement probabilities @xmath152 and the post  measurement states @xmath153 that @xmath154    defining @xmath155 one has @xmath156 , and @xmath157 for all @xmath61 : in fact @xmath158 and @xmath159 are conjugate operators via a unitary , by the polar decomposition . finally , by the data processing inequality  @xcite @xmath160 and we are done .",
    "we apply this to the complete measurement in the basis @xmath161 on the receiver s system @xmath73 , and obtain : @xmath162\\!. \\end{split}\\ ] ] each of the two terms corresponding to @xmath163 can be written in the form @xmath164 since this  by the reasoning of section  [ sec : noent ]  is bounded by @xmath165 , we get the desired bound @xmath166 .",
    "now we demonstrate how , utilizing a code for the classical adder channel , the points in the region @xmath167 can be achieved . for this , let an @xmath31block code for the classical binary adder channel be given , with rates @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this code can be used to encode using the initial ghz  state : instead of sending a bit @xmath168 each sender applies @xmath169 .",
    "it is easily seen that by a c  not of his share of @xmath68 onto the other two qubits he receives through the channel and measuring in the standard basis the receiver obtains exactly the same data as in the classical case with the classical adder code .",
    "however , this still allows sender one ( say ) to encode an extra bit into the phase : she either applies @xmath170 or @xmath5 on her part of @xmath68 , thus either leaving the joint state in the subspace @xmath171 or steering it isometrically into the orthogonal subspace @xmath172 note that both these subspaces are stable under the channel and that the named @xmath170 action commutes with it .",
    "so , the receiver can decode the extra bit first , by distinguishing first @xmath173 and @xmath174 by a nondemolition measurement ( then rotating back into @xmath173 if need be ) and then proceeding as just described with the classical code .",
    "this achieves the rate point @xmath175 .",
    "equally , we can achieve the point @xmath176 , proving our claim .",
    "the general form of an entangled state between the users systems and the receiver s is @xmath177 this to have maximal entanglement it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath178 for all @xmath7 , and the @xmath179 are orthonormal vectors .    in this case",
    "the general upper bounds for @xmath180 are dominated by @xmath181 , so again we only have to estimate the rate ",
    "sum @xmath182 : first , for _ unitary _ actions @xmath183 , @xmath184 of both users , the resulting state @xmath185 is still maximally entangled , hence the output state is an equal mixture of @xmath186 for an orthonormal system @xmath187 .",
    "its von neumann entropy is , by equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) , equal to @xmath188 .",
    "thus , if both users are restricted to unitary codings , we find @xmath189 and the bound can be achieved by taking the normalized haar measure for either user , or  more discretely  the uniform distribution on the pauli unitaries ( including @xmath190 ) for either user .",
    "note that again , like in the case of the classical adder channel , we can not give an explicit good code , nor is it obvious to produce optimal zero  error codes : our argument relies on the random coding in the general coding theorem  [ thm : qmac : cap ] .      to begin with , comparing the rate regions described so far",
    ", we see that they increase as we go from no entanglement , via partial to maximal sender  sender entanglement , and further as we increase the sender ",
    "receiver entanglement .",
    "there are , however , two important caveats to consider before concluding that the _ capacity region _ increases with the available entanglement ( apart from only conjecturing eq .",
    "( [ eq : uue - rr ] ) to be the optimal bound on the rate sum for partial sender  sender entanglement ) :    first , we have in both scenarios considered in section  [ sec : uurent ] assumed that the encoding is done using unitaries .",
    "though we do nt expect non  unitary operations to perform better ( as they introduce further noise ) we lack a proof of that statement .",
    "second , we have on occasions ( sections  [ sec : noent ] and  [ sec : uurent ] ) only considered single ",
    "copy maximisation of the involved informations .",
    "as was pointed out in the beginning the outer bounds on the capacity region apply in general only if the signal states allowed in coding are products .",
    "this is satisfied in all situations under investigation here if the encoding operations ( unitary or general ) are products themselves .",
    "the situation may change if arbitrary encodings on blocks are allowed ( as maybe for the single ",
    "user channel : this relates to the additivity of the holevo capacity of a channel ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is quite conceivable that the analysis of section  [ sec : noent ] will not apply any longer .",
    "the same holds for the entanglement  assisted situations : only in a case like maximal entanglement in section  [ sec : uuent ] the bounds are so simple that they obviously still apply here .",
    "we would like to point out that the problem of determining the capacity region in the presence of entanglement ( in particular to find out if it increases at all beyond the separable encoding region discussed above ) is not contained in the analogous discussion of  @xcite : this is another and more general instance of the extended additivity question for the classical capacity of quantum channels , discussed in  @xcite : notice that in the discussion there , as in the case of section  [ sec : noent ] above , the sender input states of their choosing into the channel , while in the presence of entanglement they input quantum operations .",
    "let us now turn to an investigation of the analogous problem for @xmath191 senders , each sharing an ebit with the receiver initially : @xmath192 instead of aiming at finding the whole capacity region of the @xmath0user quantum binary adder channel , we will concentrate on a quantity of particular interest for symmetric channels like this one : the maximal rate sum @xmath193 .",
    "we remind the reader that for a classical binary adder channel this is maximized by @xmath0 uniform input distributions , for which @xmath194 becomes the entropy of a binomial distribution , and @xmath195 for large @xmath0  @xcite .    for the entanglement  assisted quantum case , consider for the moment a scheme where each user modulates her share of the entangled state @xmath196 with a pauli operator , uniformly chosen at random from @xmath197 . because these can always be commuted through to acting on @xmath198 , all signal states of this channel are ( up to local unitaries on the receiver system ) equivalent to @xmath199 and the average output is maximally mixed on @xmath200 qubits .",
    "to evaluate the holevo information in the bound for the rate sum , we thus have to calculate the entropy of the state @xmath201 .    ) , while the line is the asymptotics of these values for large @xmath0 , @xmath202.,width=321 ]    since @xmath201 is an average over the symmetric group , we write it in terms of the clebsch  gordan decomposition of @xmath203 into irreducible decompositions of @xmath204 and @xmath205  @xcite : @xmath206 with the ( @xmath204 , irreducible ) spin representations @xmath207 of dimension @xmath208 , and the ( @xmath205 , irreducible ) permutation representations @xmath209 of dimension @xmath210 .",
    "hence , by writing @xmath196 in this decomposition for both sender and receiver system , and applying schur s lemma , @xmath211 with some maximally entangled state @xmath212 on @xmath213 . from counting dimensions",
    ", we can calculate the ( probability ! ) weights in this sum : @xmath214 , and we get , @xmath215 for @xmath10 we recover our result from section  [ subsec:2ebits ] , which gives rate sum @xmath216 ; for @xmath217 and @xmath218 , this formula gives values @xmath218 and @xmath219 , respectively .",
    "for large @xmath0 , we can quite straightforwardly see that @xmath202 .",
    "the plot in figure  [ fig : manysenders ] illustrates the result .",
    "we have introduced and studied the quantum binary adder channels , determining its capacity region in the case of two senders , without prior entanglement and with the help of various three ",
    "party entangled states between the senders and the receiver .",
    "it turned out that sender ",
    "sender entanglement already increases the capacity region ( and that this region is indeed directly related to the amount of entanglement available ) , to become even larger for sender ",
    "receiver entanglement , which we studied in two important cases : a ghz  state and maximal entanglement ( 2 ebits ) .    for a large number @xmath0 of users",
    ", we found that maximal sender ",
    "receiver entanglement almost triples the achievable rate sum compared the classical adder channel .",
    "though we did nt prove it , it seems likely that our figure actually is also best possible .    among questions that deserve further study we would like to advertise two as specially interesting : first ,",
    "as the case of `` much entanglement '' in our case study proved extremely fruitful , we are motivated to ask about the _ entanglement assisted _ capacity region of a quantum multiple access channel , in the spirit of the beautiful work  @xcite , where the classical capacity of a quantum channel was studied in the presence of _ arbitrary _ entanglement .",
    "second , we propose the problem of finding the rates of _ quantum _ information transmission via the quantum adder channel , and more generally for an arbitrary quantum multiple access channel , which lies out of the scope of the present investigation .",
    "the authors would like to thank a.  s.  holevo for his help in bringing about their collaboration .",
    "gvk was supported by the watkins  johnson company .",
    "aw was partially supported by the sfb 343 `` diskrete strukturen in der mathematik '' of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft , by the university of bristol , and by the u.k . engineering and physical sciences research council .",
    "the classical analogue of entanglement between the communication parties is shared randomness .",
    "does this additional resource change capacity regions ?    as it turns out , the answer is `` no '' : the reason being that the use of shared randomness can be described as ( jointly ) randomly using several ordinary communication protocols . also , in multiuser situations we favour the average error concept ( average error probabilities over assumed uniform distribution on all message sets ) over the familiar maximal error concept in single  user situations",
    "hence , if we are given a code with shared randomness and all its @xmath220 ( average ) error probabilities bounded by @xmath221 , there is one of the constituent ordinary codes with average error probabilities bounded by @xmath222 .",
    "observe that @xmath220 is a constant of the setup , e.g.  the number of senders in the multiple ",
    "access channel .",
    "however , to conclude that shared randomness is no good , would be premature . indeed , as we will indicate here , one of its uses may be to turn the awkward average error performance into maximal error bounds .",
    "this is something nontrivial  in contrast to the case of single ",
    "sender coding where the two concepts are essentially equivalent ",
    ", for it is known that the _ maximal error _",
    "concept can yield strictly smaller capacity regions than the _ average error _ condition  @xcite .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a two  sender multiple access channel , with a code of rate @xmath223 for sender @xmath7 ( @xmath224 ) , and assume that there is common randomness of rate @xmath223 between the sender @xmath7 and the receiver : let the messages be represented by integers @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and the common randomness as uniformly distributed random variables @xmath227 ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "sender @xmath7 then uses the given code to encode the message @xmath228 as @xmath229 and sends the codeword corresponding to @xmath230 through the channel .",

    "clearly , the average error probability of the given code equals the individual message error probability ( and hence the maximum error probability ) of this scheme .    while this ( simple ) scheme requires quite a lot of common randomness , standard derandomisation techniques ( see e.g.  the communication complexity textbook  @xcite )",

    "<S> we analyze the quantum binary adder channel , i.e.  the quantum generalization of the classical , and well  studied , binary adder channel : in this model qubits rather than classical bits are transmitted . </S>",
    "<S> this of course is as special case of the general theory of quantum multiple access channels , and we may apply the established formulas for the capacity region to it . however , the binary adder channel is of particular interest classically , which motivates our generalizing it to the quantum domain . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out to be a very nice case study not only of multi  user quantum information theory , but also on the role entanglement plays there . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the analogous classical situation , the multi  user channel supported by shared randomness , is not distinct from the channel without shared randomness , as far as rates are concerned . </S>",
    "<S> however , we discuss the effect the new resource has on error probabilities , in an appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus specially on the effect entanglement between the senders as well as between senders and receiver has on the capacity region . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in some of these cases one can devise rather simple codes meeting the capacity bounds , even in a zero  error model , which is in marked difference to code construction in the classical case .    </S>",
