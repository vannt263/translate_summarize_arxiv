    "silicon carbide can exist in very large number of polytypes , of which hundreds were already identified @xcite .",
    "they are created due to different stacking sequences , still preserving tetrahedral configuration of silicon and carbon atoms .",
    "these polytypes belong to wide bandgap semiconductors , having its gaps , ranging from 2.403 ev ( 3c ) , 3.101 ev ( 6h ) , 3.285 ev ( 4h ) to 3.300 ev ( 2h ) @xcite .",
    "also , sic stacking faults , being a planar large area defects , could be obtained in a controlled fashion .",
    "these structures , chemically identical with the material of the locally adjustable bandgap , are new , potentially important , quantum structures @xcite .",
    "in addition , a number of quantum structure based devices , using sic as building material was developed @xcite .",
    "these structures are based on the material having its properties , extremely attractive in many applications in electronics @xcite , that is a wide bandgap semiconductor , having superior electronic properties , displaying high values of several important parameters like breakdown electric field ( @xmath2 ) , forward current density ( up to @xmath3 ) , saturated electron drift velocity ( @xmath4 for 4h - sic and @xmath5 for 3c - sic ) and room temperature mobility ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 for 6h - sic and 4h - sic respectively ) , and finally , high blocking voltage observed in typical mosfet devices @xcite .",
    "it may be used in high temperature environment because it is thermally resilient and has high thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "being mechanically extremely hard and chemically inert @xcite , sic can be applied in a number of important applications , mostly in high power , high temperature and high frequency electronics @xcite .",
    "therefore sic and the structure based on this compound attracted tremendous interest resulting in huge number of publications .",
    "the most successful method of the growth of large size high quality crystals is based on physical vapor transport ( pvt ) , known as a modified lely method first developed by tairov and tsvetkov @xcite .",
    "the method , though technically difficult due to very high temperatures required , was developed to the stage in which the large size sic crystals are grown and are distributed commercially . yet , despite considerable success , the method is still plagued by difficulties most notably by creation of micro- and nano - pipes @xcite , that deteriorate or even block functioning of sic - based devices .",
    "the density of these defects was substantially reduced which allowed to use of lely grown sic substrates in technology of electronic devices .",
    "the pipe problem still remains essential , thus basic research and development of the technology are both needed to alleviate it completely .",
    "it is well known that the modified lely method relies on the chemical decomposition of the source sic material into si , @xmath8 and @xmath9 volatile species .",
    "the transport process is , therefore , prone to the chemical instabilities , which affect the chemical state of sic surface , leading to structural and chemical transformation which may contribute to the generation and preservation of the pipes during the growth .",
    "it is therefore understandable that the atomistic structures of various sic surfaces , belonging to different polytypes , were intensively studied . here",
    "we limit our discussion to the stoichiometric polar surfaces of hexagonal polytypes , i.e. 2h- , 4h- and 6h - sic(@xmath0 ) and sic(@xmath1 ) surfaces .",
    "in fact , the clean hexagonal sic ( 0001 ) surfaces are difficult to achieve , as they are typically covered by si or c atoms , or other adsorbed species like oxygen , hydrogen etc . despite the fact that the dft studies of these surfaces have considerable value as the reference point for the investigations of the adsorption phenomena and their influence on the electronic and structural properties of sic(@xmath0 ) and sic(@xmath1 ) surfaces . in an early study of these systems ,",
    "sabisch et al .",
    "@xcite showed that both si- and c - terminated surface undergo strong relaxation of the topmost layer by surface reconstruction .",
    "the top si and c layers move 0.15   and 0.25   towards the sic interior , a considerable fraction ( about @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) of ideal 0.63   distance .",
    "the second layer , i.e. c and si layers move in opposite direction by 0.04   and 0.11  which is much smaller fraction of the ideal distance 1.88  .",
    "third layer relaxation is small , moving the atoms by 0.02   and 0.03  , respectively . again",
    "the direction is reversed , the third layer atoms are moved towards sic interior .",
    "the above described relaxation type indicates that the ionic contribution in this effect is essential and the subsurface fields are important factors . despite that these authors calculated surface band structure of both surfaces without reference to this field @xcite .",
    "using dft lda , they obtained indirect bandgap of 6h - sic bulk equal to 1.97 ev , which reflects well known under - estimate of bandgap energy in this approach .",
    "the band structures of both surfaces were compared with the bulk data .",
    "they identified the flat band in the gap , originating from dangling bonds of surface si and c atoms .",
    "the si related surface state is about 1.5 ev above the c - related states which was attributed to difference in ionic character of both surfaces .",
    "a charge transfer towards c - surface was predicted and proved by the charge density distribution plots .",
    "it was also shown that both states are half - filled i.e. the surface is metallic .",
    "it is interesting to note that the charge density distribution of the dangling bonds is totally different : c - state is quasi - symmetric with some dominance of the internal part , while in si - related state the charge is located exclusively in the region above the si atom .",
    "the dispersion of both states is generally small which is due to small overlap of the neighboring atom wavefunctions . as expected , larger dispersion is observed for si - related states @xcite .",
    "the adsorbate - covered sic(@xmath0 ) and sic(@xmath1 ) surfaces display large variety of different reconstructions such as ( @xmath12 ) , ( @xmath13 ) , ( @xmath14 ) and ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "the plethora of different symmetries was studied and several different models were proposed @xcite .",
    "the subject remains under intense dispute . a new impetus to the studies of nonstoichiometric sic surface",
    "was given by the discovery of graphene on both si- and c - terminated sic surfaces @xcite .",
    "since the subject is vast and not in the mainstream of the present work it will not be discussed here .",
    "it is interesting to note that the surface structure , defined by the positions of the adsorbed atoms is very sensitive to external factors .",
    "this effect was investigated by righi et al .",
    "@xcite they have found that , at the surface , the two - dimensional effect favor the formation of 3c - sic .",
    "in contrast to adsorbate covered surfaces , the clean polar surfaces of other hexagonal polytypes were expected to have essentially similar properties , as the differences in atom arrangement are observed deep in the bulk .",
    "still this effect could be investigated along with the role of the subsurface electric field .",
    "the present paper is devoted to study the methodology of thick slab simulations , the role of electric field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : acpdon ] ) and the influence of stacking sequence on electronic and structural properties of polar sic(@xmath0 ) and sic(@xmath16 ) surfaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we give a brief overview of employed computational methods .",
    "[ sec : surfacemodels ] describes the construction of surface models .",
    "we analyze there the influence of finite number of layers on reliability of calculations .",
    "we also study the effect of surface termination by hydrogen atoms and show that they can be used to adjust electric field inside a slab .",
    "[ fig : acpdon ] explains the subsurface field and its connection with surface acceptor and donor states together with its modeling in the slab simulations . as described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : surfaceproperties ] , there is significant difference between shockley and tamm surface states . as showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : acpdon ] , shockley states can be transformed into bulk states under sertain electric field conditions . on the other hand , tamm states , irrespective of electirc field , are placed in the band gap . in sec .",
    "[ sec : surfaceproperties ] we present obtained structural and electronic properties of examined surfaces .",
    "[ sec : summary ] summarizes our work .",
    "we have carried out self - consistent total - energy calculations based on density functional theory . the code vasp developed at the institut fr materialphysik of universitt wien",
    "was employed @xcite .",
    "the projector augmented wave ( paw ) approach @xcite was used in its variant available in the vasp package @xcite . for the exchange - correlation functional generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) according to perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite was selected .",
    "a plane wave cutoff energy was set to 500 ev . in bulk calculations",
    "11x11x11 monkhorst - pack k - point mesh was used @xcite .",
    "lattice parameters obtained for bulk sic polytypes ( 2h , 4h , 6h ) summarized in table [ tab : table1 ] are in good agreement with the experiment @xcite .",

    "relative deviations from experiment are given in parentheses . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "extensive density functional study of bare and h - terminated sic surfaces was presented .",
    "different sic(@xmath0 ) and sic(@xmath1 ) polytypes : 2h , 4h , 6h were considered and compared .",
    "it was determined that twelve si - c layers is a sufficient number for high precision calculations .",
    "structural optimization was performed for 2h- , 4h- and 6h- sic(@xmath0 ) as well as sic(@xmath1 ) surface and no significant differences between them were found .",
    "it was shown that for all cases ( h - terminated 2h- , 4h- , 6h - sic ) electric field within the slab can be adjusted .",
    "field intensity dependence on the h positions for sic(@xmath0 ) and sic(@xmath1 ) have been presented ( table [ tab : table3 ] and [ tab : table4 ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig : banddoswithh ] and [ fig : banddoswithh2 ] prove that fermi level is pinned to the surface states .",
    "the energy of surface related states of both si- and c - terminated surfaces are moved by the subsurface field with respect to vbm . in case of si - terminated surface",
    "the energy is shifted by about 2 ev while in the c - terminated surface , this shift amounts to about 1 ev .",
    "this effect can be used as a simulation tool , e.g. , for the identification and subsequent analysis of surface states as well as changing n - type and p - type doping level .",
    "the calculations reported in this paper were performed using computing facilities of the interdisciplinary center for mathematical and computational modeling ( icm ) of the university of warsaw .",
    "the research was supported by the european union within european regional development fund , through grant innovative economy ( poig.01.01.02 - 00 - 008/08 ) .",
