[",

    "if we compare the x - ray images to ground - based optical and near - uv images from the optical monitor it becomes apparent that the soft diffuse x - ray emission is closely associated with the strongest star forming regions in the disk , and with warm - ionized gas such as the h@xmath2  filament that projects beyond the optical disk of the galaxy ( fig .",

    "the larger - scale uv emission is the most asymmetrically distributed .",
    "what appears to be a uv - bright arc partially cups the nuclear emission to the west and south , with a total major - axis diameter of @xmath49 , with scattered fainter uv sources at slightly larger radius . in the h@xmath2  image",

    "[ fig : rgb_images ] ) .",
    "this ring is not visible in the soft x - ray images , even though x - ray emission is detected at regions of similar h@xmath2  surface brightness outside of the optical disk .",
    "the spatial resolution of the epic pn and mos instruments is insufficient to allow x - ray emission from compact sources to be separated from truly diffuse emission .",
    "the extended soft x - ray emission we observe is likely to be mainly diffuse thermal emission but this can not be proven with the existing data .",
    "observations with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory would certainly allow a better separation of the extended emission into diffuse and point - like x - ray sources , in particular in and around the uv and h@xmath2  bright star forming regions .      with an inclination of @xmath0 the exact location of the extended soft x - ray emission is ambiguous with respect to the true disk plane of ngc 6810 . in particular",
    "the soft x - ray emission seen in projection beyond the optical disk of the galaxy may indeed be extra - planar emission at heights of several kiloparsecs along the minor axis , or it might be emission at large galactic radius but still within the plane of the galaxy . a scale diagram of these scenarios is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .",

    "the true vertical extent of the x - ray emission @xmath55 kpc can be calculated given that the apparent projected height @xmath56 kpc is the sum of the projected extent of inclined disk ( @xmath57 , where @xmath58 ) and the projected size of the edge of the outflow @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the half opening angle in the truncated conical geometry we assume , and that @xmath61 .    in this case",
    "much of the soft x - ray emission ( @xmath62 kev ) within the optical confines of the disk and beyond it is likely to be genuinely - diffuse thermal emission . indeed fitting the epic pn and mos spectrum of the entire galaxy confirms the presence of a soft thermal component ( see below ) .",
    "note that only a minor fraction of the soft x - ray emission comes from regions beyond the optical disk of the galaxy , and it should be noted that the total x - ray spectrum presented below is not necessarily representative of this ( possibly ) extra - planar x - ray emitting material .    if the emission seen at a projected height above the disk mid - plane @xmath63 is not actually extra - planar then it must lie at a large galacto - centric radius , @xmath64 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]b . for the optically - derived inclination of @xmath65 for ngc 6810 then the north - western h@xmath2  filament , with a projected height of @xmath66 kpc , would actually extend out to @xmath67 kpc .",
    "the soft x - ray emission extends to a projected height of @xmath68 kpc , implying a true radial extent of @xmath69 kpc in this model .",

    "bright h@xmath2  and/or soft x - ray emission is not typically observed so far beyond the stellar disk of spiral galaxies unless it is extra - planar @xcite .",
    "the estimates of the true radial and vertical sizes are sensitive to the assumed geometry , in particular uncertainties in the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "for example , an error of only @xmath70 in our adopted inclination would change the radial extent of the x - ray emission in the second case given above by between 30 and 70% from the value estimated above .",
    "as emission from large galactic radius is less likely than extra - planar emission we will assume for the remainder of the paper that the emission beyond the optical disk of ngc 6810 is extra - planar .",
    "note that with the existing data we can not prove unambiguously that this is the case . sensitive high - spatial resolution x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ might be used to distinguish between the two scenarios . if the emission geometry is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]a then we would expect to see evidence of additional absorption of the x - ray emission near the eastern optical edge of the disk , as the x - ray emission seen in projection in this region would need to pass through the intervening disk of ngc 6810 to reach us ( an example of this effect can be seen in ngc 253 , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we would also need to know more about the hi  gas distribution in ngc 6810 before assessing whether such a test were feasible .",
    "hi  mapping would also be advantageous in providing more accurate determinations of the inclination angle of the disk .",

    "kpc is that this is a stellar bar .",
    "the presence of bars , and their association with the base of the wind in superwind galaxies , has been remarked upon before @xcite .",

    "of the eight methods they apply to ngc 6810 they classify it as a hii galaxy six times , with one method giving ambiguous results and one method yielding a classification of extreme starburst / borderline liner .",
    "@xcite also suggest the ngc 6810 may have been misclassified as being a seyfert 2 galaxy , based on its starburst - like radio properties and unpublished optical spectra .",
    "however they also point out that several seyfert galaxies with nuclear star formation have radio and ir properties dominated by the star formation despite being bona fide seyfert 2 galaxies .    as we have discussed the hard x - ray spectrum and luminosity of ngc 6810 are inconsistent with a seyfert 2 classification .",
    "the identification of ngc 6810 with 1h1930 - 589 is most probably spurious . that ngc 6810 had a significantly higher x - ray luminosity in the early 1980",
    "s is a less likely alternative , as there is no other evidence of ngc 6810 ever being a luminous hard x - ray source ( @xcite place a @xmath109 upper limit on the @xmath5  10 kev luminosity of ngc 6810 of @xmath110 based on _ ariel 5 _ data ) , nor would the optical classification of the galaxy suggest it to be , or have recently been , a seyfert galaxy .",
    "the possibility remains that either a low luminosity agn , or a more luminous but very heavily obscured agn , is present in ngc 6810 .",
    "deep observations with the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) on _ suzaku _ would be needed to rule the second possibility out , but at present we conclude that ngc 6810 does not deserve classification as an active galaxy .",
    "radio continuum observations of ngc 6810 would offer another method of searching for a low luminosity agn , in addition to constraining the location of recent sn activity within the disk .",
    "there is one respect in which the outflow from ngc 6810 may be less than typical , in that the wind appears to originate not in a compact ( @xmath111 kpc ) nuclear starburst ( as seen in `` classic '' superwind galaxies such as ngc 253 , m82 and ngc 3079 ) , but to have a large @xmath112-kpc radius base .",
    "such `` disk - wide '' superwinds are less common than the nuclear superwinds , although there are a handful of previously known examples such as ngc 4666 @xcite and ngc 5775 @xcite .",
    "the base radius of a superwind appears to match the region of active star - formation ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and as we have mentioned earlier may be related to stellar bars ( for unknown reasons ) .",
    "indeed , one of the greatest current weaknesses of numerical models of superwinds is their failure to produce a wind base radius equal to the radius of the star formation region without imposing unphysical boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "higher spatial resolution x - ray or optical narrow - band imaging of ngc 6810 would be advantageous in showing whether the extra - planar h@xmath2  filament and/or soft x - ray emission physically joins up with the disk at @xmath113 kpc , or whether this is an optical illusion caused by the projection of a hourglass - shaped nuclear outflow onto the background disk of the galaxy .",
    "mapping is required to confirm the presence of a bar , and would also better constrain the relative geometry of the hotter ionized gas .",
    "an observation of ngc 6810 with _ xmm - newton _ reveals the presence of extended soft x - ray emission within and beyond the optical disk of the galaxy .",
    "the emission seen above and below the plane of the galaxy might be emission seen in projection from large galactic radius ( @xmath114 kpc ) , but is more plausibly extra - planar emission extending to heights of @xmath56 kpc from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "this , along with previously known h@xmath2  filamentation and peculiar minor - axis ionized gas kinematics , strongly suggest that ngc 6810 is host to a galactic - scale superwind .    the soft x - ray emission seen in projection within the optical disk of the galaxy",
    "is closely associated with star - forming regions visible in ground - based h@xmath2  and _ xmm - newton _ optical monitor near - uv imaging .",
    "the actively star forming regions , and apparently also the base of the hypothesized outflow , extend out to a radius of @xmath115 kpc from the nucleus , and are associated with either a stellar bar or a partially obscured star - forming ring .",
    "the apparently extra - planar soft x - ray emission is spatially associated with h@xmath2  emission , in particular with a prominent 5-kpc - long h@xmath2  filament on the north - west of the disk .",
    "the soft diffuse x - ray emission is presumably thermal bremsstrahlung and line emission from a collisionally - ionized plasma , based on combined epic pn and mos spectral fitting , and has an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath116@xmath117 in the @xmath20  8.0 kev energy band . the characteristic temperature @xmath118 kev , @xmath2-element - to - iron abundance ratio @xmath119 , close soft x - ray / h@xmath2  spatial association and x - ray to far - ir flux ratio @xmath120 are all consistent with local galaxies hosting supernova - driven winds .",
    "the apparently large base radius of the outflow ( @xmath115 kpc ) makes ngc 6810 one of the few `` disk - wide '' superwinds currently known , as most local superwinds appear to arise in @xmath121 kpc - scale nuclear starburst regions .",
    "hard x - ray emission from ngc 6810 is weak .",
    "the total @xmath5  10 kev luminosity is @xmath122 and the spectrum best fit with a moderately - absorbed @xmath123 power law .",
    "based on the stellar mass and star formation rate of ngc 6810 the observed hard x - ray emission can be fully accounted for with expected level of x - ray binary emission from from the old and young stellar population .",
    "the x - ray observations provide no evidence of any agn activity consistent with the previous classification of this galaxy as a seyfert 2 .",
    "we find that the x - ray , optical , ir and radio properties of ngc 6810 are all consistent with a starburst galaxy .",
    "the old classification of this galaxy as a seyfert 2 galaxy is probably incorrect , and can be explained based on the mis - identification of an unrelated heao-1 x - ray source with ngc 6810 and the broader - than - normal optical emission lines caused by a supernova - driven outflow .",
    "we conclude that ngc 6810 is an early - type spiral of roughly equivalent mass to the milky way , hosting a superwind with an intriguingly large base radius .",
