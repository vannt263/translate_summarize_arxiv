    "it is well known that a @xmath2 hyperon in free space decays into a nucleon associated with a pion (: @xmath3 , : @xmath4 ) .",
    "a bound @xmath2 in a nucleus ( @xmath2 hypernucleus ) also decays via the decay process , called the mesonic weak decay of @xmath2 hypernucleus .",
    "the relevant momentum transfer is only @xmath1100 mev/@xmath5 which is not necessarily enough high to exceed the fermi momentum .",
    "the decay rate is therefore suppressed due to the pauli blocking effect on the outgoing nucleon . especially in light hypernuclei , it is sensitive to overlap of the @xmath2 wave function with the nucleus .",
    "thus , the mesonic weak decay width of light hypernuclei gives significant information to investigate @xmath2-nucleus potential shape .",
    "it is believed that the folding potential between @xmath2 and light ( s - shell ) nuclei has a central repulsive core , which is calculated from the commonly used yng @xmath6 interaction .",
    "however , it has not been confirmed so far experimentally . for comparison of @xmath7-@xmath2 potential ,",
    "motoba  calculated the mesonic decay widths of  for two different potentials @xcite .",
    "one is derived from the yng interaction , and the other is a simply attractive potential derived from one - range - gaussian two - body interaction called `` org '' , which are determined to reproduce the @xmath2 binding energy of . according to their calculation , the difference in the decay widths between them is @xmath120% as shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "however , existent experimental data can not distinguish the two due to the large error . in the present experiment , we precisely measured both mesonic decay widths ,  @xcite and . on the other hand ,",
    "the bound @xmath2 in a nucleus can interact with a neighboring nucleon (: @xmath8 , : @xmath9 ) , called the non - mesonic weak decay of @xmath2 hypernucleus .",
    "it gives unique opportunity to study baryon - baryon weak interaction which is hidden by strong interaction in normal nuclei .",
    "the total non - mesonic weak decay width ( ) is one of the most important observables for the study .",
    "it is difficult to measure the  (= @xmath10 ) directly due to experimental difficulties such as final state interaction effect .",
    "thus , the  is usually obtained by subtracting the mesonic weak decay widths from the total decay width  ( inverse of the lifetime ) , as @xmath11 @xmath12@xmath12 .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows the latest experimental data for  and . the errors of  for both hypernuclei mainly come from those of , so that the precise measurement of  is awaited .",
