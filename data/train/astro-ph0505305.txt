    "however , the two reports about the measurements of these feature lines of sn 2004dj ( patat et al . 2004 ; gunther et al . 2004 ) show larger difference which prevents confident determination of the reddenings towards s96 . as a result",
    ", we treat e@xmath25 as a fitting parameter determined simultaneously along with the effective temperature for stellar models or the age for cluster models .",
    "the values of extinction coefficient r@xmath26 for the batc filters are obtained by interpolating the interstellar extinction curve of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) .",
    "the seds for clusters or single stars are significantly affected by the adopted metallicity .",
    "garnett et al . ( 1997 ) measured the metallicity and its radial gradient in ngc 2403 , using an expanded sample of h ii regions .",

    "we use the @xmath31 test to examine which members of the sed families are most compatible with the observed one .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 the observed integrated photometry of s96 and the best - fit sed model .    our fitting results do not favor s96 as a single luminous star . fitting the batc photometry for the stellar model yields the solution of a highly reddened [ e@xmath32 = 0.78@xmath330.05 mag ] b2iv star , but its best fit",
    "@xmath21 is 24 for 14 batc points ( with the dof to be 12 ) , indicating a rather poor quality of the fit .",
    "there are another three reasons why this fit does not work for s96 : ( 1 ) the corrected intrinsic @xmath34 color is too blue to be consistent with a b - type star ; ( 2 ) such an extremely blue and bright star is most likely to be a luminous blue variable , but it did not show significant light variations ( see fig .",
    "2 ) ; ( 3 ) the high reddening would imply an unrealistically high luminosity , @xmath35 mag at the maximum light , for sn 2004dj as a type ii - p event ( e.g. , hamuy 2003 ) .    in comparison ,",
    "the star cluster models provide better fits to the observed sed of s96 . the best reduced @xmath31 of 0.76",
    "is achieved for a cluster model with an age of 19.1@xmath333.3myr and a reddening of e@xmath25=0.34@xmath330.05 mag . when the 2mass infrared @xmath36 data ( skrutiskie et al .",
    "1997 ) were included in the fit , the best - fit parameters for s96 are a cluster age of 20.0@xmath333.4myr and a reddening of e@xmath25=0.35@xmath330.05 mag with a similarly small reduced @xmath21 of 0.77 .",
    "the reddenings yielded for these solutions are actually compatible with the one inferred from the reported na i d feature lines ( e.g. , patat et al .",
    "2004 ) , if the calibration by munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) is adopted .",

    "3 the sed based on the parameters derived by ma04 ( the dashed curve ) , which does not fit well the batc data ( especially in the @xmath12 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands ) since the best fit gives @xmath21 = 19 for 14 points .    adopting these age and extinction estimates , we determine the total mass of the stellar population from the distance to ngc 2403 and the measured @xmath39 magnitudes ( transformed from observed magnitudes in the batc bands ) .",
    "we inferred the total mass of @xmath3 m@xmath4 by comparing the measured @xmath39 band luminosity with the theoretical mass - to - light ratios ( bc03 ) .",

    "our results differ from those of ma04 at a confidence level of @xmath48 , which is primarily caused by the differences in metallicity and spectral coverage . given a lower metallicity of @xmath28 for s96 , however , the combination of @xmath18 and @xmath36 photometry yields two solutions in the age - reddening plane .",
    "the old solution of age @xmath49 myr with a reduced @xmath21 of 0.89 is similar to ours , while the young one of age @xmath510 myr is equally compelling and can not be rejected due to a smaller @xmath21 of 1.02 .",
    "the occurrence of multiple solutions may be related to the lower spectral resolution of the broadband photometry . in comparison ,",
    "the batc data constrain the sed better .",
    "for instance , our @xmath12-band photometry could indicate that s96 was not an h@xmath50-bright source and hence the young solution is unlikely , but the existing @xmath18 data alone fail to do that .",

    "3 do not fit well , e.g. the @xmath52 and @xmath37 bands .",
    "this small deviation of @xmath53 mag from the best - fit sed may be caused by the model uncertainties , the photometric errors , or even flux modulations of the immediate progenitor star . in the last case ,",
    "we set limits on the possible variability .",
    "given the luminosity of s96 and that predicted from the supergiant with a main - sequence mass of 12m@xmath4 ( which is @xmath54 mag ; e.g. , smartt et al .",
    "2003 ) , we estimate that the flux contribution of the progenitor to be 3 - 8% of the whole cluster , depending on the supergiant types . by relegating all scatters ( @xmath55 mag ) shown in fig . 2 to the progenitor itself , we place a rather crude upper limit of @xmath56 mag on its light variation .",
    "the progenitor mass of sn 2004dj inferred in s96 ( @xmath512@xmath9 ) is within the mass range found for other type ii - p sne ( leonard et al .",
    "2002 ; van dyk et al . 2003 ; smartt et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) . while it remains uncertain whether the progenitor of sn 2004dj was a blue , yellow , or red supergiant in the compact cluster s96 , a comparison of flux changes for pre- and post - outburst phases of s96 in the blue and red bands may offer key clues to distinguish the various scenarios .",
    "given a blue or yellow supergiant , the post - sn flux of s96 would change by @xmath57 mag ( fig 3 ) .",
    "if the progenitor was a red supergiant , the flux drop of s96 at nir bands from @xmath38 to @xmath58 would reach @xmath59 mag .",
    "this change might be detectable by scrutinizing s96 , preferably with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    ", when the supernova becomes significantly dimmed several years later ( zhang et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we conclude that sn 2004dj occurred in the young compact star cluster s96 of age @xmath1myr .",
    "the lack of light variations in s96 supports this cluster identification .",
    "the progenitor of sn 2004dj is inferred to be a supergiant with a main - sequence mass of @xmath60m@xmath4 .",
    "post - sn observations of s96 and detailed photometric and spectroscopic studies of the sn evolution may further constrain the progenitor of sn 2004dj .",
