    "many features of nuclei are sensitive to nuclear heating .",
    "the nuclear heating influences strongly the particle distribution near the fermi surface and reduces the fermi - surface distortion effects on the nuclear collective dynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the heating of the nucleus provides the transition from the rare- to frequent interparticle collision regime .",
    "one can expect that the zero - sound excitation modes which exist in cold nuclei will be transformed to the first - sound ones in hot nuclei .",
    "knowledge of the nuclear collective dynamics in hot nuclei allows one to understand a number of interesting phenomena , e.g. , the temperature dependence of the basic characteristics of isovector giant dipole resonance ( ivgdr ) . the existence of the ivgdr in the heated nuclei built on the excited states was established a long time ago @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a systematic experimental and theoretical study of the ivgdr in hot nuclei provides a significant information on the isovector collective motion at non - zero temperatures @xcite .",
    "a good first orientation in a description of the ivgdr in hot nuclei is given by a study of the isovector response and the relevant energy weighted sums within the quantum rpa - like approaches @xcite-@xcite or the semiclassical kinetic theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in the present work , following the ideology of the kinetic theory , we consider both temperature and relaxation effects on the ivgdr characteristics .",
    "our semiclassical kinetic approach ignores both the shell and single particle spin effects .",
    "nevertheless , it seems to be quite instructive for an investigation of the averaged properties of the many - body systems . in many cases",
    ", it allows us to obtain analytical results and represent them in a transparent way .",
    "there are also some conceptual advantages in the use of the kinetic theory .",
    "kinetic approach involves the temperature directly into the equations of motion for the distribution function , e.g. , the temperature is considered here as a dynamic variable . in contrast , in quantum approaches the temperature appears after ensemble smearing of the observable quantities and can not be attributed to the equation of motion for the wave function .",
    "moreover the kinetic approach can be easily generalized to consider the relaxation ( damping ) processes by introduce of the collision integral @xcite .",
    "note that a similar extension of the rpa due to the involving of the coupling with @xmath6 states provides only the fine structure of the giant multipole resonance ( gmr ) @xcite and an additional smearing procedure for the strength function has to be used to derive the corresponding collisional width of the gmr .",
    "note also that the non - collisional fragmentation width of the gmr ( spreading of the gmr over non - collective @xmath7 excitations in the rpa ) does not drive the system toward a thermal equilibrium but rather indicates a redistribution of the particle - hole excitations in the vicinity of the collective state @xcite . in the kinetic approach , this mechanism is presented due to the landau damping .    in what follows we use the kinetic approach to study both the temperature and mass number dependencies of the averaged characteristics of the ivgdr , such as centroid energies , width , isospin symmetry energy , mass coefficient , energy weighted sum ( ews ) and ews enhancement factor .",
    "the corresponding analysis within rpa and beyond rpa requires a large amount of numerical calculations , see e.g. @xcite , which not necessary provide a clear understanding of above mentioned macroscopic features of the ivgdr .",
    "both the quantum rpa and the kinetic approaches use the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "we apply the effective landau interaction in nuclear interior and the macroscopic boundary condition in surface region .",
    "the macroscopic boundary condition includes the phenomenological surface tension coefficient and thereby substitutes for an effective interaction within the surface layer .",
    "note that the effective interaction is usually not quite well - defined near nuclear surface because of strong particle density inhomogeneity in this case and the involving of the relevant boundary conditions can be used to improve the description .",
    "our goal is also to study the conditions for zero- to first- sound transition in presence of the velocity - dependent forces and the effect of the thermal landau damping @xcite on the low - energy tail of the strength function under different temperature and relaxation conditions .",
    "similar problems were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite by neglecting the velocity - dependent part of landau forces and using the simplest boundary condition of steinwedel - jensen ( sj ) model for the wave number @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the nuclear radius . however , it is well known @xcite that such kind of boundary condition do not allow the correct description of the @xmath4-dependence of the ivgdr energy for light nuclei .",
    "a prove of the modified boundary condition for the isovector eigenmode for a finite fermi - liquid drop plies an important role in our consideration .",
    "there are different theoretical approaches to describe the temperature behavior of the ivgdr width .",
    "below , we will restrict ourselves by the collisional damping and the thermal landau spreading .",
    "the alternative approach is the thermal fluctuation model ( tfm ) in the adiabatic coupling scheme @xcite which explains the temperature increase of the ivgdr width as an effect of the adiabatic coupling of the ivgdr to thermal shape fluctuations .",
    "one can expect that the combine of both approaches will be able to provide a satisfactory description of both the temperature and the mass number dependencies of the ivgdr width @xcite .",
    "this is an object of our forthcoming investigation .    finally , we would like to note that we use the ivgdr as an instrument to study the isovector motion in a spherical nuclear fermi - liquid drop .",
    "our claim is to describe the general features of collective excitations , such as the @xmath4-dependence of the ivgdr energy and the isovector sound mode in nuclear fermi liquid ignoring many quantum effects .",
    "in particular , our approach provides the possibility to compare the predictions of the standard liquid drop model with the fermi liquid drop one where the dynamic distortions of fermi surface is taking into account .    in section 2",
    "we apply the landau s kinetic theory to the evaluation of the response function in a two - component nuclear fermi liquid .",
    "both the temperature and the relaxation phenomena are taken into account . in section 3",
    "we derive the energy weighted sums as the moments of the strength function .",
    "numerical illustrations , summary and conclusions are given in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "to derive the energy - weighted sums for the isovector excitations , we will consider the density - density response of two - component nuclear matter to the following external field    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the small amplitude , @xmath12 is the one - body operator @xmath13and @xmath14 is the isotopic index ( @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) for proton and @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) for neutron )",
