    ", we have that question  [ gq ] is still open in dimension  @xmath36 , and our paper would like to be a further step towards this direction .    in the literature ,",
    "most of the research related to question  [ gq ] heavily relies on the analysis of minimizers of the energy functional .",
    "this approach was also inspired by the classical @xmath5-convergence results ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which established an important link between the level sets of the solutions and the study of hypersurfaces with minimal perimeter .",
    "on the other hand , from the point of view of pure mathematics , it is interesting to consider the case of solutions that do not necessarily have minimizing properties , or whose minimizing properties are not completely known a - priori . as a matter of fact , these solutions also appear in concrete situations , since there is numerical evidence that some solutions show unstable patterns before settling down to more stable configurations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    therefore , the scope of this paper is to investigate symmetry results without assuming any minimality condition on the solution , but only monotonicity assumptions , energy bounds and some geometric information on the limit interface .    for this , we will derive rigidity and symmetry results from either the behavior of the limit level set or the one of the limit varifold , using some results in  @xcite in order to introduce and describe the limit interface without minimizing assumptions ( notice that in this case the @xmath5-convergence theory can not be applied ) .",
    "more precisely , the cornerstone to describe the limit interface lies in the assumption that @xmath3 satisfies the following energy bound : for any  @xmath45 , @xmath46 for some  @xmath47 independent of @xmath48 .",
    "such energy bound is a classical assumption in the setting of semilinear elliptic equations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and it is satisfied by minimizers and monotone solutions with some conditions at infinity ( see e.g. theorem 5.2 in @xcite ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "it is valid for quasiminimal solutions too ( see lemma  10 in  @xcite ) and it is also implied by the weaker condition on the potential energy @xmath49 see  @xcite . by scaling",
    ", the energy bound in   implies that the rescaled energy with density @xmath50 is locally bounded uniformly in  @xmath51 . under this condition , and recalling  , the results of  @xcite come into play .",
    "first of all , we fix a domain ( for convenience a cylinder ) and we look at the asymptotics of the rescaled level sets in such domain .",
    "that is , given  @xmath52 and  @xmath53 we denote by  @xmath54 the ( open ) cylinder of base radius  @xmath55 and height  @xmath56 , i.e. we set @xmath57 then we fix ( once and for all in this paper ) the quantities  @xmath58 , @xmath59 and ( see e.g. page  52 in  @xcite ) we have that , up to a subsequence , @xmath60 converges a.e .",
    "in  @xmath61 to @xmath62 , i.e. we can define  @xmath63 as the set of points  @xmath64 such that  @xmath65 , and then  @xmath66 approaches a.e .",

    "we observe that  @xmath67 is a measurable function , since it is obtained by limit of measurable ( and , in fact , continuous ) functions , and therefore  @xmath63 is a measurable set .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth to point out that we do not identify  @xmath63 with the set of its points of lebesgue density  @xmath4 , since we have defined it directly via the pointwise convergence of the rescaled solution  @xmath66 .",

    "having clearly stated the notion of the limit level set , now we introduce a more general object which encodes further asymptotic and geometric properties of the solution",
    ". namely ( see theorem  1 and proposition 4.2 . of  @xcite )",
    "we have that there exists a varifold  @xmath71 ( which we will call `` limit varifold '' and whose geometric support will be denoted by  @xmath71 as well ) such that ( up to subsequences ) :    * @xmath72 uniformly on each connected compact subset of @xmath73 ; * for any @xmath74 and for any  @xmath75 the set  @xmath76 converges uniformly to  @xmath77 , i.e. , if we set @xmath78 then for any  @xmath79 there exists  @xmath80 such that for any  @xmath81 we have that @xmath82    we remark that the limit set  @xmath63 and the limit varifold  @xmath71 that we have discussed here have a simple geometric explanation in terms of the physical interpretation of the allen - cahn equation : namely , they represent the limit interface that separate two coexisting phase states .    using the setting mentioned above , the first result that we present deals with the rigidity properties of the solutions which are inherited from the structure of the limit level set  @xmath63 :    [ t1.0 ] let  @xmath3 be a solution of   satisfying   and  . suppose that there exist  @xmath83 $ ] , and  @xmath84 , @xmath85 $ ] , with  @xmath86 , such that @xmath87 and @xmath88 then :    * the limits in   hold true , * the solution  @xmath3 is a local minimizer , * if @xmath44 , then  @xmath3 is  @xmath4d .",

    "we emphasize that no energy assumption is needed in this case . indeed",
    "( 6 ) , in this case , is a byproduct of the other hypotheses .",

    "while in theorem  [ t1.0 ] , [ t04 ] , [ t04-bis ] and  [ ttx ] we have deduced symmetry results from the structure of the limit level set  @xmath63 , now we will prove further rigidity results under some geometric control on the limit varifold  @xmath71 :    [ t1 ] let  @xmath3 be a solution of   satisfying   and   and let  @xmath71 be the associated limit varifold .",
    "suppose that there exist two points  @xmath131 and  @xmath132 that do not belong to  @xmath71 , with @xmath133 then :    * the limits in   hold true , * the solution  @xmath3 is a local minimizer , * if @xmath44 , then  @xmath3 is  @xmath4d .    concerning the assumptions of theorem  [ t1.0 ] and  [ t1 ] , it is worth to remark that , in general , condition is not enough to imply  , nor the existence of the points  @xmath134 and  @xmath135 in theorem  [ t1 ] .",
    "the reason is , roughly speaking , that the limit interface could be `` vertical '' .",

    "@xmath143 , theorem  [ t1 ] can be strengthened : namely , it is enough that the limit varifold does not contain the vertical line in order to deduce symmetry properties , as stated in next result :    [ t2 ] let  @xmath40 and  @xmath3 be a solution of   satisfying   and   and let  @xmath71 be the associated limit varifold .",
    "suppose that there is a point of the vertical line @xmath144 which is not contained in  @xmath71 .    then  @xmath3 is  @xmath4d .",
    "we remark that the results obtained are valid also for more general bistable nonlinearities than the classical allen - cahn equation ( as a matter of fact , only in theorem  [ ttx ] one needs the nonlinearity to grow linearly at the origin , in order to exploit the results of  @xcite ) .    also , it is worth to point out that theorems  [ t1.0 ] , [ t04 ] , [ t04-bis ] and  [ ttx ] do not use the limit varifold  @xmath71 , but only the limit level sets  @xmath63 and @xmath69 .",
    "we also observe that the assumptions used in this paper are geometric and related to the asymptotic behavior of the interface of the problem : we think that these kind of hypotheses are somehow natural from the viewpoint of the physical applications and they may be easier to check in concrete cases than the usual variational assumptions ( such as the one requiring minimality of the solution ) .",
    "furthermore , conditions on the limit interface are perhaps more feasible to be checked in concrete applications , when one `` sees '' in practice the interface , and then can deduce from the symmetry results of the theory that the phase state depends , at a large scale , only on the distance from the phase separation .    in this , spirit , as a final observation",
    ", we point out that the symmetry of the solution is , in the end , somehow equivalent to the flatness of its interface , according to the following result :    [ coro ] let  @xmath3 be a solution of   satisfying   and  .",
