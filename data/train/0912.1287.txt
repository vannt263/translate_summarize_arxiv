    "quantum mechanical tunneling is an extremely important phenomenon in various fields of physics , chemistry and biology @xcite .",
    "most of the electronic transitions in molecular systems can be understood as non adiabatic transitions among electronically adiabatic eigen states at each fixed nuclear configuration .",
    "nonadiabatic tunneling , is a tunneling accompanied by a nonadiabatic transition @xcite .",
    "the nonadiabatic tunneling is different from ordinary tunneling which involves single potential .",
    "it should be noted that these two cases become the same under strong diabatic coupling limit .",
    "this is not the case in general , and the tunneling is affected by the upper adiabatic potential .",
    "so the nonadiabatic tunneling process can be controlled by the diabatic coupling , i.e. , this can be switched on and off by switching the coupling . in this paper",
    "we are dealing with nonadiabatic tunneling in a one dimensional semi - infinite periodic potential system . switching in one dimensional periodic potential systems",
    "have been gaining attention since the original works done by kronig and penney @xcite .",
    "complete transmission , which occurs at certain discrete energies in a semi - infinite periodic potential energy system , can be completely switched off by using a complete reflection due to an impurity potential created in the array .",
    "positions of the complete reflections are determined by the shape of the potential and the nature of coupling .",
    "so this complete switching can be realized by changing one of the potential in the array to create an impurity .",
    "similar idea was proposed by carter @xcite , based on an array of periodic potential barriers . the molecular switching model based on finite nonadiabatic tunneling potential system",
    "was originally proposed by nanbu _",
    "in thise paper we use one dimensional semi - infinite periodic potential systems to show the possibility of molecular switching using our simple analytically solvable model . in the following",
    "we will first discuss our two state model .",
    "we consider two diabatic curves , crossing each other . there is a coupling between the two curves , which causes transitions from one curve to another .",
    "this transition would occur , in the simplest approximation near the vicinity of the crossing point .",
    "in particular , it will occur in a narrow range of x , given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the nuclear coordinate and @xmath2 is the crossing point . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are determined by the shape of the diabatic curves and @xmath5 represent the coupling between them .",
    "therefore it is interesting to analyse a model , where coupling is localized in space near @xmath2 .",
    "thus we put @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a constant .",
    "this model has the advantage that it can be exactly solved @xcite . in the following",
    "we will first discuss our result of the two state curve crossing problem , which will be used in later section to analyze an ideal one dimensional semi - infinite periodic potential system .",
    "we start with a particle moving on any of the two diabatic curves and the problem is to calculate the probability that the particle will still be in that diabatic curve after a time @xmath8 .",
    "we write the probability amplitude for the particler as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the probability amplitude for the two states . @xmath12",
    "obey the time dependent schr@xmath13dinger equation ( we put @xmath14 ) @xmath15 in the above equation @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 in the above @xmath24 and @xmath25 are determined by the shape of that diabatic curve .",
    "@xmath26 is a position dependent coupling function we shall eventually assume that @xmath26 is a dirac delta function . in the following we will use the abstract operator notation of quantum mechanics .",
    "we found it convenient to define the half fourier transform @xmath27 of @xmath28 @xmath29 half fourier transformation of eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) gives @xmath30 this may be written as @xmath31 @xmath32 is defined by @xmath33 @xmath34 . in the position representation , the above equation may be written as @xmath35 the green s function is defined by @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the position eigen ket with an eigenvalue @xmath38 @xmath39 using the partition technique @xcitewe can write @xmath40 as given below @xmath41^{-1}|x_0\\rangle\\ ] ] the above equation is true for any general @xmath42 .",
    "this equation considerably simplifies if @xmath42 is a dirac delta function at @xmath2 , which in the operator notation may be written as @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46",
    ". then @xmath47^{-1}|x_0\\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath48 is defined by @xmath49 and corresponds to the propagation of the particle starting from @xmath38 , on the second surface in the absence of coupling .",
    "now we will use the operator identity @xmath50 @xmath51^{-1}\\ ] ] inserting the resolution of identity @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 we now put @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) and solve it to find @xmath56^{-1}\\ ] ] this when substituted back into eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) gives @xmath57 by using the same procedure one can derive analytical expression of @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 similarly one can derive the expression for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "once @xmath62 is known , one can calculate wave function explicitely and using the wave function one can easily calculate transition probability from one diabatic potential to the other . in the following , we will apply our two state result to the case of one dimensional semi - infinite periodic potential system .",
    "we imagine the problem of atom hopping reaction on a particular surface .",
    "suppose active sites ( which can adsorb atom ) on the surface are arranged on a straight line .",
    "so we are thinking of one dimensional motion of an atom along the surface .",
    "the potential energy curve ( after fixing the position of active sites ) as a function of the position of atom will look like `` one dimensional periodic potential system '' .",
    "now we consider the motion of active sites too .",
    "we take two neighboring active sites @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where an atom from @xmath63 is transferred to @xmath64 .",
    "the potential energy curve for @xmath65 and @xmath66 crosses at a point ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "when this same atom transfers from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ( the next neighboring active site ) , the potential energy curve for @xmath69 and @xmath70 crosses at another point .",
    "here we assume that the motion of all active sites are coupled to the motion of it s nearest neighbouring active sites via dirac delta functions - so that we can use our two state result to analyze this problem .",
    "so if an atom transports from one active site to another active sites through @xmath71 active sites on the surface , there will be @xmath72 potential energy curves and @xmath71 crossing points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . here",
    "we assume @xmath71 to be very large ( semi - infinite limit ) .    in the following we will analyse this semi - infinite periodic potential system using our two state result .",
    "now first we assume that the all active sites are equivalent and the distance between any two neighboring active sites is the same , so the distance between any two neighboring crossing points will be the same .",
    "we have @xmath73 potential energy curves , we want to start our calculation with the @xmath71-th potential energy curve and let @xmath74 denote the green s function for the vibrational motion of the @xmath71-th active site , when it s vibration is uncoupled from the vibrations of all other active sites .",
    "let @xmath75 denote the green s function for the vibrational motion of first @xmath76 active sites , when only the vibrational motion of @xmath76-th active site is uncoupled from that of the @xmath71-th active site . now using our two state theory (",
    "coupling is represented by dirac delta function ) we have derived an analytical expression of the green s function for the vibrational motion of first @xmath71 active sites , where the potential energy curve describing the vibrational motion of @xmath71-th active site is coupled to that of @xmath76-th active site at @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 now we calculate the green s function for the vibrational motion of the @xmath73 active sites , where the potential energy curve describing the vibrational motion of the @xmath73-th active site is coupled to that of the @xmath71-th active site at @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath71 is very large ( semi - infinite ) using the symmetry argument one can easily prove that @xmath80 so we get @xmath81 if we put @xmath82 and @xmath83 , in the above equation we get @xmath84 the above equation can be simplified to @xmath85g^{(n)}(x_n , x_n;e ) \\\\\\nonumber & k_0 ^ 2g_0^{n+1}(x_n , x_n;e ) g^{(n)}(x_n , x_n;e ) ^2+g_0^n(x_n , x_n;e ) = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we solve the above equation for @xmath86 .",

    "@xmath90 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so those enrgy ranges for which @xmath91 is negative , complete transmission is possible . in the following",
    "we will discuss the result of our numerical calculation using eq .",
    "it is possible to find @xmath74 only for few cases and harmonic potential is one of them .",
    "for example , if @xmath92 then the analytical expression of the corresponding green s function is known@xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath63 for harmonic potentials [ eq .",
    "we use harmonic potential of frequency @xmath93 @xmath94 and mass @xmath95 . the distance between the equilibrium positions of any two",
    "neighboring harmonic potential we take , is @xmath96 .",
    "the distance between the crossing points of any two neighboring harmonic potential we take , is @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath7 we take is @xmath98 @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the result of our calculation ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) shows that ",
    "@xmath63  is negative over a range of energy near zero point vibration @xmath100 , this means that @xmath101 has non - zero imaginary part over the same range of energy , so the system has a continuum of vibrational eigen energies in that range of energy .",
    "same is true for other vibrations ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ....... ) also .",
    "so complete transmission is possible near those energy values ( @xmath104 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 ....... ) .",
    "these complete transmissions can be completely switched off by using a complete reflection due to an impurity potential created in the array .",
    "nonadiabatic tunneling in an ideal one dimensional semi - infinite periodic potential system is analyzed using our model hamiltonian .",
    "it was shown that complete transmission is possible for certain range of energies and complete reflection is possible by adding impurity potential in the array .",
    "the same model can be applied to multi - state electron transfer model , where the atomic coordinate will be replaced by a global coordinate representing the nuclear polarization of the system .",
    "our method is applicable to those systems , where green s function for the motion in the absence of coupling is known .",
    "the method has been applied to the problem where motion takes place on parabolic potentials , for which the green s function can be found . the same procedure is also applicable to the case where @xmath105 is a non - local operator and may be represented by @xmath106 @xmath7 @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are arbitrary acceptable functions . choosing both of them to be gaussian",
    "should be an improvement over the delta function coupling model .",
    "@xmath105 may even be a linear combination of such operators .",
