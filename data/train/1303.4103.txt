    "remarkably , the non - powerlaw form of @xmath94 conspires with the @xmath195 overlap distribution to cause an approximate power law in @xmath52 , with exponent @xmath79 . at present",
    "it is not clear whether the power - law behavior of @xmath52 , or the exponent values , becomes exact in some limit .    the @xmath82 behavior results in the dynamical feature that we have highlighted in this work : in the bottom row",

    "the behavior in this regime is approximately @xmath205 , with @xmath206 for small @xmath188 and @xmath207 slightly smaller for large @xmath188 .",
    "this is consistent with our prediction of @xmath128 ( section [ sec_suppl_intermediate_region_from_power_law ] ) .",
    "note that , in the large @xmath188 cases , there are oscillations in the @xmath205 region , which result from the contribution of the higher bands .",
    "it would be interesting to find out if an extended intermediate power - law region is visible in the time evolution of observables that are more commonly studied ( or more likely to be experimentally measurable ) than the loschmidt echo .",
    "as the density ( filling ) is increased , the features we have presented gradually disappear .",
    "[ fig_suppl_bh_uquench_unitfilling ] shows the case of unit filling ( 8 bosons in 8 sites ) .",
    "the density of states and work distributions are significantly different ; we do not analyze them here .",
    "curiously , in weak quenches between small values of @xmath62 ( leftmost panels ) , there is a sequence of dominant overlaps that seems to follow a @xmath195 behavior , and a small intermediate - time region does appear in @xmath127 . in the corresponding work distribution ( not shown ) , there is no obvious @xmath82 behavior .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the intermediate - time regime appears at unit filling . to explain this",
    ", one could consider two different types of @xmath208 limits .",
    "presumably , the small intermediate - time region will disappear in the large-@xmath24 limit taken with filling held constant ( usual thermodynamic limit ) , but would get more extended in the large-@xmath24 limit taken with fixed @xmath209 . a systematic study of the shape of the overlap distribution , work distribution and density of states as a function of filling and size is clearly called for , but is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "some @xmath24-dependence is explored in sections [ sec_suppl_hcb_ladder ] and [ sec_suppl_aubryandre ] .",

    "; nor is there any power law like behavior in the overlap distributions .",
    "this is expected because the super - linear edge - singularities and the intermediate - time regime in @xmath29 are novel features of low - density systems .",

    "we now consider bosons on an open - boundary chain subject to to a harmonic confining trap in addition to the bose - hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath225 harmonic traps are fundamental to considerations of cold - atom experiments , the most prominent experimental setting for non - equilibrium dynamics in isolated systems .",
    "we consider quenches of both the trap strength @xmath226 and the trap center @xmath227 .",
    "the hamiltonian has various regimes of possible interest , such as large and small interaction @xmath62 , strong and weak trapping potential , etc . for present purposes",
    ", we will confine ourselves to small @xmath62 and weak trapping , @xmath228 .",
    "the weak and strong trapping regimes are loosely analogous to the a and c regimes of the kondo - like model detailed in the main text .    in figure [ fig_suppl_bh_trapquench ] , we show data for a trap strength quench ( @xmath229 to @xmath215 ) and for a trap position strength quench ( @xmath218 to @xmath219 ) . in both cases",
    "the overlap distribution @xmath193 shows a dominant series which follows an approximate power law ; the exponent @xmath51 is between 3/2 or 2 .",
    "as in the case without a trap ( section [ sec_suppl_bh_uquench ] ) , we show approximations to the density of states @xmath94 obtained by replacing delta functions with gaussians .",
    "the density of states is similar to the case without a trap ( [ sec_suppl_bh_uquench ] ) , but the small-@xmath73 behavior of @xmath94 seems closer to a power - law form in the presence of a trap .",
    "this exponent ( @xmath204 ) is close to 1 .",
    "the argument of [ sec_suppl_relatn_exponents ] then predicts the work distribution @xmath82 with @xmath230 ( for @xmath231 ) or @xmath232 ( for @xmath233 ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath52 does have an approximate power - law decrease with exponent around the range 5 to 7 , in the energy window where @xmath94 increases roughly linearly .",
    "it is difficult to be more certain about the exact values of the exponents , because of the scatter in the overlap distribution and because of the uncertainties associated with replacing delta functions by gaussians in order to plot @xmath94 and @xmath52 . also , it is difficult to be certain from the present data whether there is a genuine power - law region in @xmath94 or whether it is merely approximate . despite the difficulties with rigorous determination of exponents ,",
    "the relation is at least approximately valid .    in this low - density system and",
    "these types of quenches , we thus have edge singularities in @xmath52 with exponents far larger than that allowed in systems having he usual thermodynamic limit . however , as explained in section [ sec_suppl_intermediate_region_from_power_law ] , an exponent in @xmath82 with @xmath130 does not lead to a distinguishable intermediate - time region in the evolution of the loschmidt echo .",
    "indeed the bottom panels of figure [ fig_suppl_bh_trapquench ] show the @xmath99 region directly followed by the oscillatory region .",
    "the singularity exponent is _ too large _ to see an intermediate - time signature in @xmath29 .",
    "of course , an extended intermediate region might be visible in some observable other than the loschmidt echo .",
