    "swh is the average of the top third wave heights in a wave record .",
    "a rogue wave is often a single tall wave that is localized in both space and time , and appears without warning in mid - ocean .",
    "the key in theoretical understanding of rogue waves is :    * what is the mechanism of a rogue wave ?",
    "once the mechanism of a rogue wave is understood , it will be easier to understand the causes in different oceanic environments , that can lead to the mechanism to be in action .",
    "the consequences of rogue waves have been suspected for many ship sinking incidents . due to their importance in application and theory ,",
    "rogue waves have been extensively studied , for a sample of references , see @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",

    "they share the spatial and temporal locality of rogue waves . in infinite spatial and temporal ( both positive and negative ) limits , they approach the uniform stokes waves , and their main humps also have tall enough heights to mimic rogue waves @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest deep water weakly nonlinear amplitude model equations is the integrable 1d cubic focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath0 a simple peregrine wave solution to ( [ nls ] ) is @xcite @xcite @xmath1 e^{-i2 t } .",

    "when @xmath13 , the base element @xmath14 spans the spatially independent complex plane @xmath15 which is a two dimensional invaraint subspace under the nls dynamics .",
    "the dynamics on this invariant plane is given by @xmath16 the orbits on this invariant plane are given by the uniform stokes waves @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the constant amplitude and @xmath19 is the constant phase . in the original water wave variable ,",
    "these uniform stokes waves correspond to the common stokes water waves .",

    "the unstable modes are given by those @xmath34 s satisfying ( [ mi ] ) .",
    "let @xmath35 be the number of such unstable modes .",
    "then the unstable subspace @xmath36 of the periodic orbit ( [ sw ] ) has dimension @xmath35 , the stable subspace @xmath37 of the periodic orbit ( [ sw ] ) has dimension @xmath35 , and the center subspace @xmath38 of the periodic orbit ( [ sw ] ) has codimension @xmath39 .",

    "these subspaces can be exponentiated into invariant submanifolds under the nls ( [ nls ] ) dynamics via darboux transformations @xcite .",
    "we have @xcite    under the nls ( [ nls ] ) dynamics , the periodic orbit ( [ sw ] ) on the invariant plane @xmath15 has a codimension @xmath39 center manifold @xmath42 , a codimension @xmath35 center - unstable manifold @xmath43 , and a codimension @xmath35 center - stable manifold @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "explicit formulae for certain homoclinic orbits inside @xmath45 can be found in the appendix .",
    "the neighborhood of the periodic orbit ( stokes wave ( [ sw ] ) ) is divided by @xmath43 and @xmath44 into different regions .",
    "dynamics in the neighborhood of the periodic orbit follows the following inclination lemma @xcite .",
    "[ inclination lemma ] all orbits starting from initial points in the neighborhood of the periodic orbit approach the center - unstable manifold @xmath43 in forward time .",
    "see figure [ il1 ] for an illustration .",
    "notice that the center manifold @xmath42 is a measure zero subset of the neighborhood of the periodic orbit , and it is also a measure zero subset of @xmath43 .",
    "orbits starting from points inside @xmath42 of course stay inside @xmath42 .",
    "orbits starting from points inside @xmath43 but not in @xmath42 have the same homoclinic feature as those explicitly calculated in the appendix . in principle , all such orbits in @xmath43 can be constructed via darboux transformations as shown in the appendix .",
    "one can view all such orbits as rooted to the center manifold @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , each point in the center manifold @xmath42 is a fenichel fiber base point , and the fenichel fibers capture the global features of these homoclinic orbits @xcite . since the center manifold @xmath42 lies inside the neighborhood of the periodic orbit , those homoclinic orbits rooted to the invariant plane @xmath15 are good approximations of all such homoclinic orbits in @xmath43 which in general may have small amplitude oscillating tails in space and time .",
    "these homoclinic orbits in @xmath43 are generic orbits in @xmath43 in the sense that @xmath42 is a measure zero subset of @xmath43 . in view of the inclination lemma , generic orbits starting from initial points in the neighborhood of the periodic orbit approach those homoclinic orbits in @xmath43 which can be approximated by those homoclinic orbits rooted to the invariant plane @xmath15 .",
    "the infinite spatial period limits of the homoclinic orbits rooted to the invariant plane @xmath15 are the peregrine waves . in conclusion ,",
    "generic orbits starting from initial points in the neighborhood of the periodic orbit ( stokes wave ) have the homoclinic feature and peregrine wave feature ( when the spatial period approaches infinity ) .",
    "therefore , such homoclinic orbits and peregrine waves should be the most observable ( common ) waves in the deep ocean according to the nonlinear schrdinger model",
    ". they should not be the rarely observed rogue waves .",
    "when the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ nls ] ) is under perturbations ( for example by keeping higher order terms in the nls model of deep water ( [ pnls ] ) ) , the center - unstable manifold @xmath43 , center - stable manifold @xmath44 and center manifold @xmath42 persist , but @xmath43 and @xmath44 do not coincide anymore @xcite .",
    "orbits inside @xmath43 have a near homoclinic nature .",
    "the above conclusion that homoclinic orbits and peregrine waves should be the most observable common waves rather than rogue waves , still holds .",
    "based upon the above rigorous mathematical analysis on the infinite dimensional phase space where the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ nls ] ) defines a dynamical system , we conclude that peregrine waves and homoclinic orbits are the waves most commonly observable in deep ocean rather than rogue water waves .",
    "next we discuss two other possibilities for the mechanism of rogue waters .",
    "the solution operator of high reynolds number navier - stokes equations has rough dependence on initial data @xcite @xcite .",
    "temporal amplification of certain perturbations to the initial data can potentially reach @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant and @xmath49 is the reynolds number .",
    "when the reynolds number is large , such amplification can reach substantial amount in very short time .",
    "this feature of the solution operator may explain the ( no apparent reason ) sudden amplification of one wave among many into a rogue wave in the deep ocean @xcite .",
    "that particular wave may receive just the right perturbation which amplifies superfast like the above estimate , and very quickly develops into a rogue wave . in this sense , the choice of the particular wave is random , the right perturbation is random , and the temporal and spatial locations of the event are also random .",
    "all these factors may manifest into a sudden appearance of a rogue wave .",
    "high reynolds number navier - stokes equations are good models of water waves since real fluids ( water or air ) always have viscosity ( no matter how slight it may be ) . on the other hand , for simplicity ,",
    "most mathematical models of water waves are derived from euler equations , and the solution operator of the euler equations is nowhere differentiable in its initial data @xcite ( formally one can set @xmath49 to infinity in the above estimate ( [ est ] ) ) .",
    "a great open problem is whether or not water wave equations have finite time blowup solutions .",
    "a hint of finite time blowup solutions comes from simple nonlinear wave equations , for example , the one dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a complex - valued function of ( @xmath52 ) . for the initial condition of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a real - valued function , when the initial energy @xmath55 is non - positive and @xmath56 , the solution blows up in finite time @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite",
    "that is , there is a finite time @xmath57 , such that @xmath58 such a finite time blowup solution resembles very much a rogue wave in terms of spatially and temporally local nature .",
    "one should only take such a finite time blowup solution as a hint rather than a clear indication for a possible finite time blowup solution to the water wave equations .",
    "there are a lot of simple models of water wave equations , for example , the davey - stewartson equations @xcite . for the davey - stewartson equations with coefficients in the water wave regime , a finite time blowup solution has not been found .",
    "for the davey - stewartson equations with coefficients outside the water wave regime , finite time blowup solutions have been found @xcite . in the deep water limit",
    ", the davey - stewartson equations @xcite reduce to the following equation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is complex - valued and @xmath61 this equation has two conserved quantities @xmath62 @xmath63 dxdy .\\ ] ] since the two conserved quantities do not bound @xmath64 norm , this equation may have finite time blowup solutions",
    ". when the operator @xmath65 is replaced by @xmath66 there are indeed finite time blowup solutions @xcite .",
    "linearize equation ( [ hnls ] ) at @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the amplitude and @xmath69 is the phase , in the form @xmath70 one gets the linearized equation @xmath71 set @xmath72 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are complex parameters , and ( @xmath73 ) are real parameters , one gets @xmath74-i { \\omega}\\right ) a + 2 a^2 \\bar{b } = 0 , \\\\ & & 2 a^2 a + \\left ( [ ( k_2 ^ 2-k_1 ^ 2)+2a^2]+i { \\omega}\\right ) \\bar{b } = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the relation @xmath75(k_1 ^ 2-k_2 ^ 2 ) } .\\ ] ] when @xmath76 there is a modulational instability .",
    "in one spatial dimension , equation ( [ hnls ] ) reduces to the integrable cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ nls ] ) . by keeping higher order terms ,",
    "the one spatial dimension deep water wave model can be written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 represents the higher order terms which may involve a variety of terms like higher order derivatives and higher order nonlinearities @xcite . with the higher order terms in , equation ( [ pnls ] ) may have finite time blowup solutions . invoking possible finite time blowup solutions to models of water wave equations",
    "is paradoxical in the search for finite time blowup solutions to the full water wave equations .",
    "most of these models are derived under the assumption of weak nonlinearity , while finite time blowup is a strongly nonlinear phenomenon .",
    "let @xmath79 . when @xmath80 the stokes wave ( [ sw ] ) has one linearly unstable mode , and when @xmath81 the stokes wave ( [ sw ] ) has two linearly unstable modes , etc",
    ". the homoclinic orbits asymptotic to the stokes wave ( [ sw ] ) are the nonlinear amplifications of the linearly unstable modes . when @xmath82 , the homoclinic orbit is given by @xcite @xmath83^{-1 } \\cdot \\bigg [ \\cos 2{\\vartheta}_0 - i \\sin 2{\\vartheta}_0 \\tanh \\tau   \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\sin { \\vartheta}_0 \\ \\mbox{sech } \\tau \\cos y \\bigg ] \\ , \\label{sne}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 where @xmath48 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are real parameters .",
