    "many observations have successfully detected such lyman @xmath0 emitters ( laes ) from @xmath20 up to @xmath21 ( e.g. , hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1998 ; pascarelle , windhorst , & keel 1998 ; campos et al .",

    "narrow - band surveys can also map effectively large - scale distributions of laes ( e.g. , steidel et al . 2000 ; venemans et al . 2002 ; hu et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we recently made a survey of laes at @xmath15 using the narrow - band filter nb711 ( @xmath22 , fwhm=73 ) in an area of @xmath5 , and found a large - scale structure of laes of @xmath23 mpc @xmath3 @xmath24 mpc size ( shimasaku et al .",
    "this is the first discovery of large - scale structure in young universes , suggesting that the birth of large - scale structure is very early in the history of the universe and that laes are strongly biased against dark matter , since cold dark matter ( cdm ) models predict that the density fluctuations of dark matter are very small on such large scales .",
    "however , the size of the large - scale structure is nearly comparable to the size of the survey region ( @xmath25 mpc @xmath3 @xmath26 mpc ) , and thus we can not safely conclude that we are seeing a typical distribution of laes at @xmath10 . to address this issue ,",
    "it is strongly needed to enlarge the survey volume .",
    "motivated by this , we made a followup imaging survey of laes at @xmath13 , i.e. , laes located closer to us by @xmath27 mpc than those at @xmath15 , in exactly the same sky area . using these data ,",
    "we examine differences in the sky distribution of laes between the two redshifts .",
    "we adopt @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "we carried out deep imaging in the sky area of the subaru deep field ( sdf ; centered at @xmath31 [ j2000.0 ] ; maihara et al .",

    "the fwhm of the nb704 filter is 100  , giving a survey depth for laes along the sightline of @xmath32 or , equivalently , @xmath33 mpc .",
    "we observed two field - of - views ( fovs ) of suprime - cam with a large overlap , the central fov and the northern fov , to obtain data for the same region ( @xmath5 ) as imaged in the nb711 in search for @xmath15 laes .",
    "area was determined as follows .",
    "we first observed the central fov in nb711 , finding in a northern part a large - scale overdense region of lae candidates .",
    "we then imaged the northern fov with an overlap of @xmath34 to trace a northern extension of the overdense region . ] for both filters , the variation in the response profile is small across the field of view even through the fast ( f/1.86 ) prime - focus optics , with a full variation in @xmath35 of 10 ( nb704 ) and 12 ( nb711 ) .",

    "the seeing sizes of the final images are @xmath36 .",
    "to detect laes , we combine broad - band @xmath37 and @xmath38 data with the nb704 data .",

    "in contrast , a large - scale concentration of laes and large void regions are seen in fig.3 .      same as fig.2 , but for @xmath15 laes .",
    "candidates common to the @xmath13 sample are marked by open circles .",
    "second , no concentration of @xmath13 laes is found in the large - scale structure of @xmath15 laes at @xmath65 .",
    "we identify objects which are likely to be at @xmath66 from nb704@xmath58nb711 color ( @xmath57nb704@xmath58nb711@xmath59 ; 12 objects in total from the two samples ) , and plot them in cyan in figs.2 and 3 .",
    "we find in fig.3 that the objects plotted in cyan are less concentrated on the sky than the others .",
    "we also note that the sky distribution of the 12 cyan objects seems to be in the middle of the distributions of the @xmath15 laes and the @xmath13 laes .",
    "these findings indicate that the line - of - sight extension of the @xmath15 large - scale structure toward lower redshift is not larger than @xmath67 mpc .",
    "we calculate the angular correlation function ( acf ) , @xmath68(@xmath69 ) , for the two samples , using the estimator defined by landy & szalay ( 1993 ) , where @xmath69 is the angular separation .",
    "the results are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "the acf for @xmath15 laes has large positive values at @xmath70 , while the amplitude of the acf for @xmath13 laes is @xmath71 at any angular separation .",
    " angular correlation functions ( acfs ) of laes at @xmath13 ( filled circles ) and @xmath15 ( open circles ) .",
    "errorbars correspond to the @xmath72 errors .",
    "the solid line indicates the best fit of @xmath73 to the @xmath13 data .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines represent , respectively , the best fit of @xmath73 and @xmath74 to the @xmath15 data ; we find the best - fit @xmath75 to be 0.2 .",
    "the crosses indicate the acf obtained if all laes lie in the large - scale structure and their distribution in the large - scale structure is uniform .",
    "the acf of galaxies , including lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) , is approximated fairly well by a power - law function , @xmath76 ( for lbgs , see , e.g. , foucaud et al . 2003 ; ouchi et al .",
    "we thus fit @xmath77 to our lae data to examine whether this function is also a good fit to the lae data and to compare @xmath78 between the two samples , where @xmath79 is the integral constraint ( @xmath80 arcmin@xmath81 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath82 arcmin@xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath13 laes . for @xmath15 laes",
    ", we obtain @xmath85 arcmin@xmath83 , about 40 times higher than that for @xmath13 laes , laes even when the intrinsic , spatial correlation is the same .",
    "however , the difference in @xmath78 due to this effect is only about 15% . ] and find that the fit to the @xmath15 data is extremely poor ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "if we fit @xmath87 to the @xmath15 data , with @xmath75 being another free parameter , then we find a very flat power - law slope , @xmath88 , although the fit with this slope is still unsatisfactory ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "for @xmath13 laes we obtain @xmath90 .",
    "the acf of @xmath15 laes does not increase like @xmath91 , but remains more or less flat around @xmath92 at @xmath93 except for the data point at @xmath94 .",
    "fig.3 shows that most of the @xmath15 laes belong to the large - scale structure which occupies about @xmath95 of the survey area .",
    "for such an extreme distribution , it is shown that the acf has high values , @xmath96 ",
    "@xmath97 , at @xmath70 , even when we artificially re - distribute laes uniformly in the large - scale structure ( crosses in fig.4 ) .",
    "thus , the high , relatively constant amplitudes of the observed acf are largely due to the presence of the large - scale structure and the large void regions .",
    "we estimate the spatial number density of laes to be @xmath98 mpc@xmath99 for the @xmath13 sample and @xmath100 mpc@xmath99 for the @xmath15 sample . in these calculations , we adopt a survey volume of @xmath101 mpc@xmath102 ( @xmath13 sample ) and @xmath103 mpc@xmath102 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we have not applied completeness correction here .",
    "the difference in the number density between the two samples is found to be within the @xmath104 levels , although the @xmath15 laes might be slightly more numerous .",
    "the rms fluctuation of mass overdensity at @xmath105 on a sphere with a volume equivalent to the average of our two survey volumes is calculated to be @xmath106 for @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the present - day rms fluctuation of mass overdensity on a sphere of @xmath109 mpc radius ( @xmath110 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ) .",
    "this implies that the number density of laes found in a volume similar to our average survey volume will fluctuate roughly by @xmath111 ( if poisson noise is not included ) , where @xmath112 is the bias parameter .",
    "the observed small fluctuation would prefer relatively small @xmath112 values .      in the analyses above",
    ", we have not considered the possibility that our laes form structures along redshift ( velocity structures ) .",
    "a recent spectroscopic observation of a wide - field lae sample at @xmath113 has revealed distinct velocity structures with a depth of @xmath114 ( hu et al .",
    "2004 ; see also fynbo et al .",
    "2003 for a similar finding on qso - absorber fields at @xmath115 ) .",
    "laes in our samples might have such structures .",
    "multiple velocity structures within the filter bandpass make clustering analysis complicated . if , for instance , our @xmath13 laes are divided into a few velocity structures , the true clustering amplitude will be higher than inferred from the apparent sky distribution ( and from the acf measurement )",
    ". on the other hand , the large - scale structure found at @xmath15 , elongated along right ascension , may be an edge - on view of a sheet - like structure extending along the line - of - sight .",
    "velocity structures can also give an uncertainty to the estimates of number density made in  3.3 .",
    "spectroscopic data are needed for a significant fraction of our samples to examine such possibilities .",
    "hamana et al . ( 2004 ) found that the observed acf of @xmath15 laes given in ouchi et al .",
    "( 2003a ) can not be reproduced by a simple halo model which assumes laes to be associated with dark haloes , because of too strong the observed correlation on scales @xmath116 .",
    "we find that our @xmath15 laes have large - scale structure and that their acf is high and not fit by a power law , while the clustering of @xmath13 laes is very weak .",
    "these results may suggest that the clustering of laes is typically weak , possibly tracing the dark - matter distribution , and that we happened to observe an unusual region in the @xmath15 universe where laes form a large , coherent structure of a size of @xmath18 mpc .",
    "conversely , if it turns out , from a larger survey , that the @xmath15 region we observed is relatively common in high-@xmath19 universes , this will suggest that laes and lbgs are separate populations in terms of clustering properties , since the clustering of lbgs has been found to be approximated well by halo models ( hamana et al .",
    "detailed modeling of the clustering of laes based on an enlarged sample will give important hints on the nature of laes .",
    "although we did not find in our two lae samples a clear difference in the number density , a large field - to - field variance in the clustering of laes , including velocity structures , can influence measurements of the number density of laes based on narrow - band surveys , especially if the survey volumes are smaller than ours and if @xmath112 is much larger than unity ; the @xmath112 value derived from the clustering of the @xmath15 laes is as large as @xmath117 .",
    "shallower surveys will suffer from larger variances , since laes with brighter lyman @xmath0 luminosities tend to be clustered more strongly ( ouchi et al .",
    "for instance , ajiki et al . ( 2003 ) found that the number density of @xmath118 laes in their sample of @xmath119 mpc@xmath102 is three times higher than that estimated by rhoads & malhotra ( 2001 ) based on a similar survey volume ."
