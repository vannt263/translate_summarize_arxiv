    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) currently provides the `` standard '' framework for the study of the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the mssm model takes into account the constraints from the negative searches so far for an experimental signature for supersymmetry and gives circumstantial evidence for supersymmetric unified theories , such as the unification of the gauge couplings or the weak mixing angle prediction .",
    "the aforementioned constraints and predictions may also be fulfilled by other models , of string origin , and this would suggest that the mssm is only a _ minimal _ candidate model for the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "such string inspired models are regarded as `` low - energy '' limits of string theory , and they predict below the compactification scale a much richer spectrum ( than that of the mssm ) including additional states at the high scale corresponding to predicted vector - like states under standard model gauge group .",
    "the presence of such additional states in conjunction with the low - energy input can lead to a phenomenology different from that of the mssm . as a specific example which we address in this letter , consider the measurement of the strong coupling at the electroweak scale .",
    "the world average value @xcite of @xmath2 , situated rather close to the one loop value predicted in the mssm is _ below _ the two - loop mssm `` bottom - up '' prediction ( of @xmath3 ) obtained from the rge equations for the gauge couplings .",
    "while at one - loop level this prediction depends on the symmetry of the model and the multiplet content , at two - loop level a dependence of @xmath1 on the high scale thresholds is induced , and this may indicate that the mismatch between the mssm two - loop prediction and the experiment is due to our lack of understanding of the physics at the high scale .",
    "for this reason at least , exploring the phenomenological implications of string theory _ predicted _ models with additional intermediate scales finds enough justification and it may also help in selecting and restricting the number of viable string inspired models .    the exact structure of the spectrum that string - inspired models predict to exist ( in addition to the mssm spectrum higgs triplets . ] ) depends in general on the particular class of models one considers to investigate . in reference",
    "@xcite the authors presented a class of extended supersymmetric models , as the low - energy limit of a string model with calabi - yau compactification @xcite and wilson line breaking @xcite mechanism for the @xmath0 symmetry .    in a generic example of this class of models , the `` low - energy '' spectrum below the compactification scale contained @xcite the mssm spectrum plus ( pairs of ) complete five and ten - dimensional @xmath4 multiplets , `` vector - like '' under the standard model gauge group .",
    "the phenomenological implications of this case were discussed in @xcite for the case when perturbation theory applies up to the unification scale .",
    "it was found that , due to a `` mixing '' between the heavy thresholds and the two - loop contributions of the vector - like states to the running of the gauge couplings , there is only a small ( two - loop ) increase in the unification scale from the mssm prediction .",
    "the increase factor was @xmath5 , too small to make an agreement with the weakly coupled heterotic string prediction @xcite which gives an unification scale @xmath6 times larger than that of the mssm .",
    "the aforementioned factor of increase was accompanied by a small ( two - loop ) increase from the mssm prediction for the strong coupling at electroweak scale .",
    "reference @xcite also predicted another interesting possibility for the `` low - energy '' spectrum predicted by the same class of string - inspired models and this will be further analysed in this paper .",
    "this more specific model predicts not only complete five dimensional representations of @xmath4 in addition to the mssm spectrum , but also a `` split multiplet '' structure , triplet under the @xmath7 group of the standard model .",
    "the model has therefore @xcite the nice feature of avoiding the `` doublet - triplet '' splitting problem which appears in the context of ( supersymmetric ) grand unified group theories ( gut ) . in these theories ,",
    "the higgs multiplet content is a @xmath8 pair and consequently , the bare masses of the higgs doublet and higgs colour triplet have to be equal .",
    "to avoid proton decay mediated by the latter at a rate forbidden by the experimental constraints , the higgs ( colour ) triplet has to be heavy enough to suppress such processes . in the meantime",
    ", the @xmath9 higgs doublet must be light enough to explain the mass origin at the electroweak scale .",
    "this leads to the so - called `` doublet - triplet '' splitting problem , specific to supersymmetric gut theories as well as to other theories which have such higgs spectrum assignment .",
    "in addition to avoiding the `` doublet - triplet '' splitting problem , this last specific model provides @xcite the unification of the gauge couplings , even in the absence of a grand unified group such as @xmath4 or larger .",
    "the spectrum predicted by this string inspired model contains below the compactification scale a pair @xmath10 and an arbitrary number ( say @xmath11 ) of extra pairs @xmath8 of @xmath4 _ in addition _ to the matter fields ( three families ) and the gauge sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , but without its higgs content .",
    "pairs @xmath8 and 2 pairs @xmath10 in addition to the mssm spectrum . ]    a coupling of the triplet of the `` incomplete '' @xmath4 representation , @xmath10 , to the triplet component of a five dimensional representation of the form @xmath12 can naturally lead to a _",
    "large _ mass ( due to their vector - like character under sm group ) term for the triplets , via a symmetry breaking mechanism when the ( standard model singlet ) higgs field @xmath13 acquires a v.e.v .",
    ", through a mechanism detailed in @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism applies to the _ extra _",
    "@xmath14 ( vector - like ) pairs of @xmath8 which also acquire a _",
    "large _ mass ( through couplings @xmath15 via the same mechanism @xcite which provides a natural explanation for the origin of such mass terms ) .",
    "the _ bare _ value of this mass , assumed to be the same for all @xmath16 s is denoted by @xmath17 for further reference .",
    "the ( remaining ) doublet components of the initial pair @xmath8 are left uncoupled and thus light and can therefore account for the higgs content of the mssm .",
    "it is the purpose of this letter to examine in some detail the phenomenological implications of this model , in a two - loop analytical approach .",
    "the predictions we make refer to the value of @xmath1 , the unification scale itself and the scale of the intermediate matter , which can induce numerical instabilities of the solution , see figures 3 and 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar case . ] , @xmath17 .",
    "the reason for performing a two - loop analytical investigation of this model is three - fold ; as mentioned , the discrepancy between the mssm prediction for @xmath1 and the experiment arises mainly due to the two - loop corrections , and thus threshold dependence at the high scale plays a significant role .",
    "moreover , any better candidate model than the mssm should eliminate such discrepancy at this level of accuracy .",
    "finally , the spectrum predicted by our model contains in addition to the @xmath7 triplet components , complete @xmath4 representations which are known to change the low energy prediction for @xmath1 at two - loop level @xcite only .",
    "the present approach also provides an analytical method to examine , in two loop order the rge prediction for the strong coupling and may be applied to other ( string - inspired ) models with spectrum different from that of the mssm .",
    "we show that @xmath1 can be reduced from the mssm value ( of @xmath3 or larger ) and be brought within the experimental limits @xcite of @xmath18 , while keeping the unification scale @xmath19 close to that of the mssm for an intermediate scale @xmath17 within one order of magnitude below @xmath19 .",
    "the standard tool to exploring the phenomenological consequences of our model is the renormalisation group evolution ( rge ) for the gauge couplings , for which we take as ( low - energy ) boundary conditions the well known values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , obtained from measured electromagnetic coupling and weak mixing angle at the electroweak scale . to apply this tool we need to know the multiplet content ,",
    "which was detailed in the introduction , and the symmetry group , which is _ just _ the standard model gauge group , with @xmath4 normalisation for the @xmath22 coupling .",
    "thus , the one - loop beta function before the decoupling of any extra ( complete or incomplete ) multiplet is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 the mssm one - loop beta function , @xmath25 , and with @xmath26 to account for two pairs of triplets or equivalently four triplet states , hence the factor 4 in the definition of @xmath27 .",
    "after the decoupling of all additional states , the one - loop beta function is just that of the mssm , namely @xmath24 . with some loss of generality",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case when the extra states ( triplets and 5-plets ) have the same _ bare _ mass which we called @xmath17 and this assumption does not reintroduce the `` doublet - triplet '' problem . the general case of considering different masses for @xmath28 and @xmath29 pairs",
    "can be done following the present approach , although introducing one further mass parameter would make the analysis less tractable .    to evaluate the full two - loop `` running '' of the gauge couplings , including the effects of the heavy thresholds , we use the integral form of the `` nsvz beta function '' .",
    "this has been computed in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and is given by @xmath30 \\left ( { 1-t(g)\\frac{\\alpha } { 2\\pi } } \\right ) ^{-1 } \\label{shifmanbetaalpha}\\ ] ] with the definition ( @xmath31 is the running scale ) @xmath32 and where @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the dynkin index for the adjoint representation and for @xmath35 representation respectively ( not necessarily the fundamental one ) .",
    "the above sum runs over _ all _ matter fields @xmath36 in representation @xmath35 and this includes the extra heavy states in addition to the low energy spectrum of the mssm .    following the details given in @xcite to integrate the beta function given above",
    ", we find that , to all orders in perturbation theory , the gauge couplings run , in the presence of the extra matter , as follows @xmath37 ^{1/3}-\\sum_{j=1}^{3}\\sum_{\\phi _ { j}}{}\\frac{\\beta _ { i,\\phi _ { j}}}{%   2\\pi } \\ln z_{\\phi _ { j}}(m_{z})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , are the contributions to one - loop beta function , where the sum runs over all chiral supermultiplets in representation @xmath43 . ] of the matter fields @xmath44 ( j = generation index ) , while @xmath45 is the one - loop beta function for the pure gauge ( + gaugino ) sector ; the higgs ( + higgsino ) sector contribution is included separately via the terms proportional to @xmath46 ; finally , @xmath47 is the unified coupling while @xmath19 stands for the unification scale of our model .",
    "we have @xmath48 with @xmath49 independent of the values of @xmath50 .",
    "the field @xmath44 runs over the set @xmath51 , in this order , with @xmath50 as generation index .",
    "the coefficients @xmath52 in eq.([intalph ] ) represent the low energy supersymmetric thresholds and they would be equal to zero if supersymmetry were valid at the electroweak scale .",
    "their exact expressions will not be of concern to us as we will present our phenomenological predictions as a change to the mssm predictions which implicitly contain the dependence on @xmath52 .",
    "( @xmath52 also contain conversion scheme factors ( @xmath53 ) which in our calculation will cancel against those of the mssm of equal value ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the low - energy supersymmetric spectrum ( i.e. the value of @xmath52 ) can be taken into account in our present approach by allowing in our final results , a _ range _ of values for the mssm variables which are present in our final expressions .    to compute the two - loop running for the gauge couplings , only a one - loop expression for the wavefunction renormalisation coefficients",
    "is required .",
    "note that in the two - loop approximation there is no regularisation ambiguity which arises only in three - loop order @xcite . at @xmath54",
    "scale the one - loop expressions for @xmath55 s have the following structure @xmath56^{-\\frac{2 c_k(f)}{b^*_k } }   \\left[\\frac{\\alpha_k(\\mu_g)}{\\alpha_k(m_z)}\\right]^{-\\frac{2 c_k(f)}{b_k } } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\prod_{k=1}^{3 } \\left[\\frac{\\alpha_g}{\\alpha_k(\\mu_g ) } \\right]^{\\frac{2 c_k(f)}{b_k}\\frac{n+\\delta b_k}{b^*_k } }   \\left[\\frac{\\alpha_g}{\\alpha_k(m_z)}\\right]^{-\\frac{2 c_k(f)}{b_k}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 stands for any higgs or mssm chiral field .",
    "strictly speaking in the expressions of @xmath55 factors we should have used the mean mass of the extra states @xmath58 instead of @xmath17 ; however this difference is an additional radiative effect and thus is of two - loop order for @xmath55 s or of three loop order for the gauge couplings , and can be neglected in our two loop calculation . from equations ( [ intalph ] ) and ( [ zzss ] )",
    "we find the following rge equations @xmath59+\\frac{n+\\delta b_i}{2\\pi } \\ln\\left[\\frac{m_g}{\\mu_g } \\right]-\\frac{1}{% 2\\pi}\\sum_{j=1}^{3}{\\tilde y}_{ij}\\ln \\left[\\frac { \\alpha_g}{\\alpha_j(\\mu_g)}\\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\sum_{j=1}^{3 } \\frac{b_{ij}}{b_j } \\ln\\left[\\frac{\\alpha_g}{% \\alpha_j(m_z)}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 % -\\frac{\\delta_{ij}(n\\lambda_j+6\\delta_{3j})}{b^*_j}\\ ] ] with @xmath61 while @xmath52 , @xmath42 , stand for the low - energy ( tev scale ) supersymmetric thresholds .    from eq.([hhmssm ] ) we can again see that the presence of @xmath17 in the two - loop term @xmath62 instead of the mean physical mass @xmath63 of the additional multiplets we consider would account for an additional ( three - loop ) radiative effect and we neglect it , as it is beyond our two - loop approximation for the running of the gauge couplings .",
    "thus , we can say that in two - loop order the extra states contribute to the gauge couplings running through their common bare mass only .",
    "at this point we would like to emphasize that the result of equation ( [ hhmssm ] ) can also be obtained using the `` standard '' rge equations , integrated in two - loop order , with appropriate taking into account of the heavy thresholds that the additional states we consider bring in . using a radiative dressing of the masses of the additional states and following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite one will obtain the same result . as it was the case there , there is a cancellation of the heavy thresholds against the two - loop contributions of the additional states we considered and as a consequence in eq.([hhmssm ] ) only the two - loop mssm beta function appears , and _ not _ that in the presence of additional states ) with that of eq.(7 ) of ref.@xcite . ]",
    "@xmath8 or @xmath10 .",
    "eq.([hhmssm ] ) is actually more general ; if one considers vector - like matter in addition to the mssm sector , with some arbitrary @xmath64 contribution to one - loop beta function , the two - loop rge equations have a form similar to that of eqs.([hhmssm ] ) and ( [ whywhy ] ) with the replacements @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    to compute the unification scale @xmath19 , the strong coupling @xmath1 and the value of the mass scale @xmath17 we must make some assumptions about the low energy supersymmetric spectrum which affects the running of the gauge couplings through the terms @xmath52 , as seen from eq.([hhmssm ] ) .",
    "since the effects of the low energy supersymmetric thresholds on the predictions of the mssm are relatively known @xcite , we prefer to express our predictions as a change to the mssm predictions which all have this dependence included ( and assume that @xmath52 s have equal values to those of the mssm ) .",
    "we therefore consider the two - loop running of the gauge couplings in the mssm , which is of the form ( the mssm variables are labelled with an `` o '' index to distinguish them from those of our extended model ) @xmath67 + \\frac{1}{4\\pi } % \\sum_{j=1}^{3}\\frac{b_{ij}}{b_{j}}\\ln \\left [ \\frac{\\alpha _ { g}^{o}}{\\alpha _ { j}^{o}(m_{z})}\\right ]   \\label{mssm}\\ ] ] we can then substitute , @xmath68 gev and @xmath69 or larger .",
    "these results are obtained in two loop approximation , using @xmath20 and @xmath21 as an input from experimental values for electromagnetic coupling and weak mixing angle . ]",
    "the values of @xmath52 from the above equation into eq.([hhmssm ] ) and impose that in both the mssm and our model , the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are taken equal with the corresponding experimental value , so @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we then compute the analytical expressions for the factor of increase of the unification scale @xmath72 , the strong coupling @xmath1 ( in terms of @xmath73 ) , and the bare mass of the extra states , @xmath17 .",
    "this can be done following the approach of @xcite and using that , under two - loop terms we can substitute the arguments of the `` log '' terms by their one loop values , as the difference would be of higher order .",
    "this means that @xmath74 and we further replace @xmath75 by its one loop analytical expression , which is correct for a two loop running for the gauge couplings .",
    "after some tedious algebra we find the following two - loop analytical results @xmath76^{{\\cal e}_1 } \\left\\{1+\\frac{18\\,\\alpha_3^o(m_z)}{1 - 7n } \\left(\\alpha_g^{-1}-\\alpha_g^{o-1}\\right)\\right\\}^{{\\cal e}_2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\prod_{j=1}^{3 } \\left\\{1+\\frac{7b^*_j}{1 - 7n } \\left[1-\\frac{\\alpha_g}{\\alpha_g^o}\\right]\\right\\}^{{\\cal d}_j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath77 + \\sum_{j=1}^{3 } \\ln\\left\\{1+\\frac{7b^*_j}{1 - 7n } \\left[1-\\frac{\\alpha_g}{\\alpha_g^o}\\right]\\right\\}^{{\\cal a}_j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath78^{{\\cal e}_3 } \\left\\{1+\\frac{18\\,\\alpha_3^o(m_z)}{1 - 7n } \\left(\\alpha_g^{-1}-\\alpha_g^{o-1}\\right)\\right\\}^{{\\cal e}_4 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\prod_{j=1}^{3}\\left\\{1+\\frac{7b^*_j}{1 - 7n } \\left[1-\\frac{\\alpha_g}{\\alpha_g^o}\\right]\\right\\}^{{\\cal h}_j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 the above analytical solution to eq.([hhmssm ] ) agrees well with the numerical one . to find a numerical solution we just solved numerically the system of three equations obtained from subtracting eq.([mssm ] ) from ( [ hhmssm ] ) to eliminate the @xmath52 s and also replaced @xmath83 by @xmath74 .",
    "the agreement between the two approaches is good , within less than @xmath84 relative error for @xmath1 , @xmath85 relative error for the factor @xmath86 , and @xmath87 relative error for @xmath88 .",
    "the larger error exists when the coupling @xmath47 is larger and is also due to the presence of the logarithmic dependence the terms involving @xmath19 and @xmath17 come with in the rge equations .",
    "in this section we analyse the results and the phenomenological implications of eqs.([ores1]),([ores4 ] ) and ( [ ores2 ] ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the ratio of the unification scales @xmath86 for different values of @xmath14 in function of the ratio @xmath89 .",
    "we observe that this ratio is less than unity for most of the parameter space and the effect of extra states we added does not bring the unification scale closer to the weakly coupled heterotic string scale which is a factor of @xmath6 above the mssm value .",
    "however , for _ large _ @xmath14 the ratio @xmath86 is very close to unity , and therefore the change induced in this case from the mssm scale , is very small .",
    "( note that the perturbative calculation is valid for large @xmath14 , as long as @xmath90 , with @xmath91 ) . for @xmath92",
    "we find @xmath19 above @xmath93 for most values of @xmath47 , and therefore the change induced by the extra matter to the mssm unification scale is insignificant .",
    "this is a result of the presence of two competing effects , the reducing of the scale ( at one - loop level ) due to the @xmath7 triplet states and the opposite effect of increasing the scale due to the complete five dimensional multiplets .",
    "such opposite effects are also manifest in the predicted value of @xmath1 . in figure 2",
    "we presented this value for different @xmath14 in function of the ratio @xmath89 .",
    "we observe that we can accommodate values of @xmath1 smaller than in the mssm and in better agreement with the experimental value @xcite @xmath94 , provided that the value of the unified coupling is marginally increased from the mssm value , for the case of small @xmath14 . for @xmath92 @xmath1 is within the experimental limits for a larger range of values of @xmath47 .",
    "the effect of reducing the strong coupling is essentially due to the presence of the colour triplets we considered .",
    "the result is somewhat expected as , unlike models which include complete @xmath4 representations to the mssm spectrum and where complete representations introduced the same term @xmath95 in the running of the gauge couplings @xcite , the situation here is different because the similar contribution is now @xmath96 , with @xmath27 standing for the triplets contribution ( see eqs.([intalph ] ) , ( [ hhmssm ] ) ) .",
    "this means that the _ relative _ behaviour of the gauge couplings running is already changed at one - loop order from the mssm prediction due to the presence of the @xmath7 triplets while the complete five dimensional multiplets bring a two - loop additional increasing effect @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that the input mssm value for @xmath73 considered here was @xmath97 ; this represents the lower limit prediction of a `` bottom - up '' approach in the mssm case , and therefore the predictions we made for @xmath1 could increase slightly if the input for @xmath73 is above this value .",
    "figure 3 shows the ratio @xmath88 in terms of @xmath47 and this determines the value of one of these when the other is fixed . for the parameter space with good predictions for @xmath1",
    "we find that the ( bare ) intermediate scale is in the region of @xmath98 gev , only a factor of @xmath99 below the standard mssm unification scale .",
    "the large value for the intermediate scale avoids an enhancement of the proton decay rate by the colour triplet states .",
    "in this work we have considered the phenomenological implications of a string - motivated model , which predicts below the compactification scale the existence of @xmath14 extra pairs @xmath8 of @xmath4 states and 2 pairs of @xmath7 triplets in addition to the mssm spectrum . the motivation for studying this model originates in the suggestion that this might also solve the `` doublet - triplet '' splitting problem , commonly faced by grand unified group - based theories .",
    "the strong coupling at the electroweak scale can be reduced below the value of the two - loop mssm prediction and be brought into better agreement with the experiment while the value of the unification scale , in two - loop order , remains close to the mssm prediction .",
