    "a. b. migdal s contribution to modern theoretical physics is very impressive .",
    "his endowment in and deep understanding of different domains of physics , including the nuclear and many - body physics , based on fermi - liquid approach , is outstanding . in migdal seminal papers",
    "a solid base for studying strongly interacting fermi systems and phase transitions occurring in them has been established @xcite .",
    "migdal s daring ideas of phase transitions related to @xmath0 condensation in nuclei and neutron stars @xcite inspired a theory of fermion condensation that has permitted to construct a new class of fermi liquids , new quasiparticles and new type of merging of single - particle levels of both finite and infinite fermi systems like nuclear , atomic and solid state systems @xcite .",
    "the new class of fermi liquids is represented by strongly correlated fermi systems where enormous number of experimental facts are collected . understanding the physics of these systems",
    "stimulates intensive studies of the possible manifestation of fermion condensation in other areas , as it has happened in the case of metal superconductivity , whose ideas were successfully used in describing atomic nuclei @xcite and in a possible explanation of the origin of the mass of elementary particles .",
    "therefore , we expect that the ideas associated with the new fermion condensation quantum phase transition @xcite in one area of research stimulates intensive studies of the possible manifestation of such a transition in other areas .",
    "strongly correlated fermi systems represented by heavy fermion ( hf ) metals and quasi - two - dimensional @xmath1he are among the most intriguing , best experimentally studied and fundamental systems in physics , which until very recently have lacked theoretical explanations @xcite .",
    "these are also a field never far from applications in synthesis of novel materials for cryogenics , rare earth magnets and applied superconductivity .",
    "the properties of these materials differ dramatically from those of ordinary fermi systems @xcite .",
    "their behavior is so unusual that the traditional landau quasiparticles paradigm does not apply to it .",
    "the paradigm states that the properties is determined by quasiparticles whose dispersion is characterized by the effective mass @xmath2 which is independent of temperature @xmath3 , the number density @xmath4 , magnetic field @xmath5 and other external parameters .",
    "the above systems are , however , in defiance of theoretical understanding .",
    "the ideas based on the concepts ( like kondo lattice involving quantum and thermal fluctuations at a quantum critical point ( qcp ) have been used to explain the unusual physics of these systems known as non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior . alas , being suggested to describe one property , these approaches fail to explain the others .",
    "this means a real crisis in theory suggesting that there is a hidden fundamental law of nature , which remains to be recognized .",
    "it is widely believed that utterly new concepts are required to describe the underlying physics .",
    "there is a fundamental question : how many concepts do we need to describe the above physical mechanisms ? this can not be answered on purely experimental or theoretical grounds .",
    "rather , we have to use both of them .",
    "for instance , in the case of metals with heavy fermions , the strong correlation of electrons leads to a renormalization of the effective mass of quasiparticles , which may exceed the ordinary , `` bare '' , mass by several orders of magnitude or even become infinitely large at temperatures @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the effective mass strongly depends on the temperature , pressure , or applied magnetic field .",
    "such metals exhibit nfl behavior and unusual power laws of the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic properties at low temperatures .",
    "the landau theory of the fermi liquid has remarkable results in describing a multitude of properties of the electron liquid in ordinary metals , fermi liquids of the @xmath1he type and nuclear liquid @xcite .",
    "the theory is based on the assumption that elementary excitations determine the physics at low temperatures .",
    "these excitations behave as quasiparticles , have a certain effective mass , and , judging by their basic properties , belong to the class of quasiparticles of a weakly interacting fermi gas . hence , the effective mass @xmath2 is independent of the temperature , pressure , and magnetic field strength and is a parameter of the theory .",
    "the landau fermi liquid ( lfl ) theory fails to explain the results of experimental observations related to the dependence of @xmath2 on the temperature @xmath3 , magnetic field @xmath5 , pressure , etc . ;",
    "this has led to the conclusion that quasiparticles do not survive in strongly correlated fermi systems and that the heavy electron does not retain its identity as a quasiparticle excitation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the unusual properties and nfl behavior observed in high-@xmath7 superconductors , hf metals and 2d fermi systems are assumed to be determined by various magnetic quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "indeed , when reasoning by analogy with respect to the second order phase transitions , one can assume that a phase transition responsible for the nfl behavior taking place up to lowest accessible temperatures is located at @xmath8 .",
    "since a quantum phase transition occurs at @xmath8 , the control parameters are the composition , electron ( hole ) number density @xmath4 , pressure , magnetic field strength @xmath5 , etc .",
    "a quantum phase transition occurs at a quantum critical point , which separates the ordered phase that emerges as a result of quantum phase transition from the disordered phase .",
    "it is usually assumed that magnetic ( e.g. , ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ) quantum phase transitions are responsible for the nfl behavior .",
    "the critical point of such a phase transition can be shifted to absolute zero by varying the above parameters .",
    "universal behavior can be expected only if the system under consideration is very close to a quantum critical point , e.g. , when the correlation length is much longer than the microscopic length scale , and critical quantum and thermal fluctuations determine the anomalous contribution to the thermodynamic functions of strongly correlated fermi system .",
    "quantum phase transitions of this type are so widespread @xcite that we call them ordinary quantum phase transitions @xcite . in this case , the physics of the phenomenon is determined by thermal and quantum fluctuations of the critical state , while quasiparticle excitations are destroyed by these fluctuations .",
    "conventional arguments that quasiparticles in strongly correlated fermi liquids `` get heavy and die '' at a quantum critical point commonly employ the well - known formula based on the assumptions that the @xmath9-factor ( the quasiparticle weight in the single - particle state ) vanishes at the points of second - order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that this scenario is problematic @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations in the order parameter developing an infinite correlation length and the absence of quasiparticle excitations are considered as the main reason for the nfl behavior of heavy - fermion metals , 2d fermion systems and high-@xmath7 superconductors @xcite .",
    "this approach faces certain difficulties , however .",
    "critical behavior in experiments with metals containing heavy fermions is observed at high temperatures comparable to the effective fermi temperature @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath11 , which is a linear function of temperature for normal lfl , @xmath12 , demonstrates the @xmath13 temperature dependence in measurements involving ceni@xmath14ge@xmath14 as the temperature varies by two orders of magnitude ( as it decreases from 6 k to at least 50 mk ) @xcite . such behavior can hardly be explained within the framework of the critical point fluctuation theory .",
    "obviously , such a situation is possible only as @xmath6 , when the critical fluctuations make the leading contribution to the entropy and when the correlation length is much longer than the microscopic length scale . at a certain temperature @xmath10 , this macroscopically large correlation length must be destroyed by ordinary thermal fluctuations and the corresponding universal behavior must disappear .    in the rest of this paper , we show that the fermion condensation quantum phase transition ( fcqpt ) @xcite is indeed responsible for the observed fascinating nfl behavior of strongly correlated fermi systems and quasiparticles survive both high temperatures and high magnetic fields . in section [ ehq ] ,",
    "we give a detailed consideration of experimental evidences in favor of existence of quasiparticles , and formulate both a scaling behavior of strongly correlated fermi systems and the extended quasiparticle paradigm .",
    "then in section [ flfc1 ] ,",
    "we consider the properties of landau fermi liquid . in section [ pom_m ]",
    "we demonstrate that the landau equation for the effective is not a phenomenological one and can be derived using the methods of density functional theory .",
    "thus , we establish the extended quasiparticle paradigm .",
    "fcqpt and a phase diagram of heavy fermion system located in the vicinity of fcqpt are investigated in section [ flfc ] .",
    "we propose that the phase diagram of systems located near fcqpt are strongly influenced by control parameters such as a chemical pressure , pressure or magnetic field .",
    "we find that under the application of the chemical pressure ( positive / negative ) qcp is destroyed or converted into a quantum critical line , correspondingly . in section [ hmf ]",
    "we establish that heavy fermion quasiparticles do exist in a very wide range of both temperatures @xmath3 and magnetic fields @xmath5 .",
    "finally , in section [ sum ] our results are summarized and discussed .",
    "there is a difficulty in explaining the restoration of the lfl behavior under the application of magnetic field @xmath5 , as observed in hf metals and in high-@xmath7 superconductors @xcite . for the lfl state as @xmath6 , the electric resistivity @xmath15 , the heat capacity @xmath16 , and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath17 .",
    "it turns out that the coefficient @xmath18 , the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath19 , and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath20 depend on the magnetic field strength b such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which implies that the kadowaki ",
    "woods relation @xmath23 @xcite is @xmath5-independent and is preserved @xcite",
    ". such universal behavior , quite natural when quasiparticles with the effective mass @xmath2 playing the main role , can hardly be explained within the framework of approach that presupposes the absence of quasiparticles , which is characteristic of ordinary quantum phase transitions in the vicinity of qcp .",
    "indeed , there is no reason to expect that @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are affected by the fluctuations in a correlated fashion .",
    "for instance , the kadowaki ",
    "woods relation does not agree with the spin density wave scenario @xcite and with the results of research in quantum criticality based on the renormalization - group approach @xcite .",
    "moreover , measurements of charge and heat transfer have shown that the wiedemann ",
    "franz law holds in some high-@xmath7 superconductors @xcite and hf metals @xcite .",
    "all this suggests that quasiparticles do exist in such metals , and this conclusion is also corroborated by photoemission spectroscopy results @xcite .    the inability to explain the behavior of heavy - fermion metals while staying within the framework of theories based on ordinary quantum phase transitions implies that another important concept introduced by landau , the order parameter , also ceases to operate .",
    "thus , we are left without the most fundamental principles of many - body quantum physics @xcite , and many interesting phenomena associated with the nfl behavior of strongly correlated fermi systems remain unexplained .    [ !",

    "concepts based on the kondo lattice and scenarios where fluctuations in the order parameter is sufficiently big and the correlation time is sufficiently large to develop the nfl behavior can hardly match up such high temperatures and explain the observed scaling behavior .    as we will see below , the large temperature ranges are precursors of new quasiparticles , and it is the scaling behavior of the normalized effective mass that allows us to explain the thermodynamic of hf metals at the transition and nfl regimes . taking into account the simple behavior shown in figs .",
    "[ shen][mnhf ] , we ask the question : what theoretical concepts can replace the fermi - liquid paradigm with the notion of the effective mass in cases where fermi - liquid theory breaks down ? to date such a concept is not available @xcite . therefore , we focus on the concept of fcqpt preserving quasiparticles and intimately related to the unlimited growth of @xmath2 . it was shown that it is capable of revealing the scaling behavior of the effective mass and delivering an adequate theoretical explanation of a vast majority of experimental results in different hf metals @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the landau paradigm based on the assumption that @xmath2 is a constant as shown by the solid line in fig . [ ybrhsin ] , in fcqpt approach the effective mass @xmath2 of new quasiparticles strongly depends on @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 etc .",

    "since we are concentrated on properties that are non - sensitive to the detailed structure of the system we avoid difficulties associated with the anisotropy generated by the crystal lattice of solids , its special features , defects , etc .",
    ", we study the universal behavior of strongly correlated fermi - systems located near their qcp at low temperatures using the model of a homogeneous hf liquid @xcite .",
    "the model is quite meaningful because we consider the scaling behavior exhibited by these materials at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the scaling properties of the normalized effective mass that characterizes them , are determined by momentum transfers that are small compared to momenta of the order of the reciprocal lattice length .",
    "the high momentum contributions can therefore be ignored by substituting the lattice for the jelly model . while the values of the scales like the maximum @xmath54 of the effective mass and @xmath52 at which @xmath54 takes place are determined by a wide range of momenta and thus these scales are controlled by the specific properties of the system . on the other hand , the dependencies of these scales on magnetic fields , temperature ,",
    "the density of system , pressure etc are again controlled by small momenta and can be analyzed within the model of hf liquid .",
    "one of the most complex problems of modern condensed matter physics is the problem of the structure and properties of fermi systems with large inter particle coupling constants .",
    "theory of fermi liquids , later called `` normal '' , was first proposed by landau as a means for solving such problems by introducing the concept of quasiparticles and amplitudes that characterize the effective quasiparticle interaction @xcite .",

    "we begin by recalling the main ideas of the lfl theory @xcite .",
