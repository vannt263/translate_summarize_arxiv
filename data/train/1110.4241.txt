    "the notion of what is fair in the allocation of one or more infinitely divisible goods to a finite number of agents with their own preferences has long been debated .",
    "predictably , no agreement has been reached on the subject .",
    "the situation is often exemplified with children ( players ) at a birthday party who are around a table waiting for their slice of the cake to be served , with the help of some parent ( an impartial referee ) .",
    "if we think about a special class of resolute children who are able to specify their preferences in terms of utility set functions , the parent in charge of the division could ease his task by using a social welfare function to summarize the children s utility values . among the many proposals , the maxmin  or rawlsian  division was extensively studied in the seminal work of dubins and spanier @xcite , who showed the existence of maxmin optimal partitions of the cake for any completely divisible cake and their main properties .",
    "they also showed that when a condition of mutual appreciation holds ( assumption _ ( mac ) _ below ) any optimal partition is also _ equitable _ , i.e. , it assigns the same level of utility for each child .    the study of the maxmin optimal partitions and their properties has continued in more recent years . in particular ,",
    "its relationship with other important notions such as efficiency ( or pareto optimality ) and , above all , envy - freeness has been investigated with alternating success : each maxmin partition is efficient , but while for the two children case brams and taylor @xcite showed that it is also envy - free , the same may not hold when three or more children are to be served , as shown in dallaglio and hill @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out the relationship with @xmath0 player bargaining solutions .",
    "if we think about the division as deriving from a bargaining procedure among children , it is straightforward to show that the bargaining solution proposed by kalai @xcite , in the case where all the players utilities are normalized to 1 , coincides with the equitable maxmin division . therefore , if the conditions proposed by dubins and spanier hold , the two solutions actually coincide .",
    "little attention has been devoted , however , to finding optimal maxmin partitions with one notable exceptions : the case of two players with additive and linear utility over several goods has been considered by brams and taylor @xcite , with the adjusted winner procedure .    for the case of general preferences ( expressed as probability measures , i.e. nonnegative and countably additive set functions normalized to 1 ) and arbitrary number of players , legut and wilczinski @xcite gave a characterization of the optimal maxmin allocation in terms of weighted density functions .",
    "moreover , elton et al .",
    "@xcite and legut @xcite provided lower bounds on the maxmin value .",
    "the optimization problem was later analysed by dallaglio @xcite .",
    "the general problem was reformulated as the minimization of a convex function with a particular attention to the case where the maxmin allocation is not equitable and the allocation of the cake occurs in stages to subsets of players .",
    "no detail , however , was given on how to proceed with the minimization .",
    "in most of the fair division literature , little is assumed about the strategic behaviour of the children .",
    "brams and taylor @xcite discuss the issue of the manipulability of the preferences : in most cases children may benefit from declaring false preferences .",
    "a different approach takes into account the possibility for the children to form coalitions after ( legut @xcite and legut et al .",
    "@xcite ) or before ( dallaglio et al .",
    "@xcite ) the division of the cake . in both cases coalitional games",
    "are defined and analysed . in the case of early cooperation among children ,",
    "the game is based on a maxmin allocation problem among coalitions , each one having a joint utility function and a weight .",
    "the first properties of the game are studied in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the analysis of the game is made harder by the difficulties in computing the characteristic function , i.e. , the value associated to each coalition .",
    "the tools we introduce , therefore , become essential in computing such values , as well as any synthetic value , such as the shapley value , associated to the game .",
    "the coalitional maxmin problem is indeed a generalization of the classical maxmin problem introduced by dubins and spanier .",
    "therefore , we consider a common approach to set up an algorithm which , at each step , will compute an approximating allocation , together with lower and upper bounds for the maxmin value .",
    "the algorithm is based on a subgradient method proposed by shor @xcite and it yields an approximation of the optimal allocation with any fixed degree of precision .    in section 2",
    "we describe the maxmin fair division problem with coalitions through the strategic model of interaction among players in @xcite and the geometrical setting employed in , @xcite and @xcite . in section 3",
    "we present the upper and the lower bounds for the objective value . in section 4",
    "we fit the subgradient method to our problem and we derive a procedure where the optimal value and the optimal partition are computed up to a desired precision and we provide a numerical example where we describe two fair division games and we compute the corresponding shapley values . some final considerations are given in section 5 .",
    "we represent our completely divisible good as the set @xmath1 a borel subset of @xmath2 , and we denote as @xmath3 the borel @xmath4algebra of subsets of @xmath5 let @xmath6 be the set of players , whose preferences on the good are @xmath7 where each @xmath8 @xmath9 is a probability measures on @xmath10 by the radon - nikodym theorem , if @xmath11 is a non - negative finite - valued measure with respect to which each @xmath12 is absolutely continuous ( for instance we may consider @xmath13 ) , then , for each @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath12 with respect to @xmath17    we will consider the following assumptions :    \\a ) _ complete divisibility of the good ( cd ) : _ for each @xmath18 and each @xmath19 such that @xmath20 , there exists a measurable set @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23    \\b ) _ mutual absolutely continuity ( mac ) : _ if there exists @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that @xmath24 then for each @xmath25 @xmath26 .",

    "let @xmath35 be the class of all @xmath33-partitions .",
    "how do players behave in the division procedure ? in the simplest case , each player competes with the others to get a part of the cake with no strategic interaction with other players .",
    "each @xmath36 determines a division of the good in which player @xmath37 , @xmath18 gets the share @xmath38 with value @xmath39 . here , individual players seek an allocation with values as high as possible . a fair compromise between the conflicting interests",
    "is given by maxmin allocation @xmath40 that achieves    @xmath41    here @xmath42 denotes the maxmin value in the classical fair division problem . with",
    "a completely divisible good , the allocation @xmath43 is fair ( or proportional ) , i.e.   @xmath44 for all @xmath45 moreover , if ( _ mac _ ) holds , it is also egalitarian , i.e.  @xmath46 for all @xmath47 ( see @xcite ) . therefore , under this assumption , an optimal allocation is also the bargaining solution proposed by kalai and smorodinsky @xcite ( see also kalai @xcite ) .",
    "dallaglio et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a strategic model of interaction , where players , before the division takes place , gather into mutually disjoint coalitions . within each coalition , players pursue an efficient allocation of their collective share of the cake .",
    "let @xmath48 be the family of all partitions of @xmath49 and , for each @xmath50 , let @xmath51 , @xmath52 and let @xmath53 be the coalitions indexes set .",
    "thus , players cluster into coalitions specified by the partition @xmath54 for each @xmath55 and each coalition @xmath56 , players state their joint preferences as follows @xmath57 with @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 the utility @xmath61 of coalition @xmath56 will be divided among its members in a way that prevents any of them to break the coalition in search of a better deal . once the global coalition structure is known , a fair allocation of the cake among the competing coalitions is sought . in this context , assigning the same value to all coalitions could yield an unfair outcome .",
    "fairness here must consider the different importance that coalitions may assume and this is taken into account by a weight function @xmath62    in this framework , each coalition takes the role of a single player in equation .",
    "following kalai @xcite , when coalitions in @xmath63 are formed and the weight function @xmath64 is considered , players should agree on a division of the cake which achieves the following value    @xmath65    each coalition can evaluate its performance in the division by considering the following coalitional game @xmath66 where @xmath67",
    ". the value @xmath68 can be interpreted as the minimal utility that coalition @xmath69 is going to receive in the division when the system of weight @xmath64 is enforced , independently of the behaviour of the other players .",
    "a crucial question lies in the definition of the weight system .",
    "we consider two proposals :    * @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "this is certainly the most intuitive setting .",
    "although very natural , this proposal suffers from a serious drawback , since players participating in the game @xmath72 may be better off waiting to seek for cooperation well after the cake has been divided ( see @xcite ) ; * @xmath73 , @xmath71 , where @xmath74 is the partition maximizing . by seeking early agreements among them , players will be better off than postponing such agreements until the cake is cut .",
    "the above mentioned problem is overcome at the cost of a less intuitive ( and more computationally challenging ) formulation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that to find these weights we need to solve .",
    "it is easy to verify that , for each @xmath75 ,    @xmath76 with equality if @xmath77 or @xmath78 where @xmath18 .",
    "the optimization problem can be seen as an infinite dimensional assignment problem . in principle",
    "we could attribute any point of the cake @xmath34 to any of the participating players ( provided certain measurability assumptions are met ) .",
    "for very special instances this becomes a linear program : when the preferences have piecewise constant densities , or when the cake is made of a finite number of completely divisible and homogeneous parts .",
    "the fully competitive value @xmath42 is a special instance of the cooperative case , since @xmath79 , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 for each @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we focus on the cooperative case alone .",
    "we now describe a geometrical setting already employed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to explore fair division problems . in what follows",
    "we consider the weighted preferences and densities , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , given respectively by @xmath84 the partition range , also known as individual pieces set ( ips ) ( see @xcite ) is defined as @xmath85 let us consider some of its features .",
    "each point @xmath86 is the image , under @xmath87 , of an @xmath88-partition of @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , @xmath89 is compact and , if ( cd ) holds , @xmath89 is also convex ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath90 so , the point @xmath91 is the intersection between the pareto frontier of @xmath89 and the egalitarian line @xmath92",
    "we turn our attention to a simpler optimization problem that may have an unfair solution , but it provides easy - to - compute upper and lower bounds for the original problem .",
    "these bounds depend on a weighted maxsum partition , which we can derive through a straightforward extension of a result by dubins and spanier @xcite .",

    ", we have a maxsum partition @xmath96 corresponding to @xmath100    the _ partition value vector ( pvv ) _",

    "therefore @xmath114    finally , since @xmath115 is a weighted average of the values @xmath116 it follows that @xmath117    the function @xmath118 was already considered in @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath118 is convex , and @xmath119    we now turn our attention to a lower bound for @xmath120 although we will see later only one pvv is enough to assure such a bound , we give a general result for the case where several pvvs have already been computed .",
    "we derive the second approximation result through a convex combination of these easily computable points in @xmath105 which lie close to @xmath120 the following result generalizes theorem 3 in @xcite and theorem 1.1 in @xcite .",

    "in fact , we get the second one after an even number of exchanges on the first : @xmath88 successive exchanges of the last row until it reach the first position , and @xmath88 successive exchanges of the last column until it reach the first position .",
    "so the two matrices in the denominator have the same determinant .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath140 , for every @xmath18 .",
    "finally , since the lower bound belongs to the convex hull of the pvv @xmath127 and the @xmath128 vectors @xmath141 @xmath130 , it is not less than the minimum component of each vector , in particular @xmath142    an illustration of the position of the bounds with respect to the partition range in the case of two coalitions is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
