    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are point - like extra - nuclear x - ray sources found in nearby galaxies , with ( isotropic ) x - ray luminosities in excess of @xmath1 ergs@xmath2 , roughly corresponding to the eddington limit accretion luminosity for a 10 @xmath3 star @xcite .",
    "the majority of ulxs are believed to be black holes accreting from their binary companion stars ( see , e.g. , reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or in few cases , perhaps from the fallback material originating from supernovae that have produced these sources @xcite .",
    "many works have shown that stellar - mass black holes ( smbhs ) can account for the properties of most ulxs , but for the most luminous ones ( with x - ray luminosities @xmath4 ) , assumptions of either truly super - eddington x - ray emission @xcite , or anisotropic ( beamed ) emission @xcite are required .",
    "alternatively , the latter sources could be intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggestion seems to be supported by their relatively low disk color temperatures inferred from x - ray spectral analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting and important to discriminate between these two kinds of black holes observationally .",
    "@xcite suggested that imbhs in x - ray binaries are more likely to be transient due to the thermal - viscous instability @xcite .",
    "the reason is that , both the high masses and wide orbits of imbhs lead to a larger accretion disk and hence lower temperature in the disk compared to the smbh case . in this letter , with different assumptions on imbh binary formation from @xcite , we have calculated the evolution of imbh x - ray binaries with a massive donor star .",
    "we describe the initial parameters for the binary evolution and the calculated results in section 2 and 3 respectively . in section 4",
    "we discuss the relation between imbhs , smbhs , and ulxs .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "we consider imbhs as ulxs associated with star formation regions in spiral or irregular galaxies . in this situation",
    ", an imbh could be formed through runaway collision in dense young star clusters within @xmath5 myr @xcite .",
    "it may acquire a binary companion via exchange encounters and/or tidal capture in the host cluster .",
    "the latter process was recently investigated by @xcite .",
    "some of their results were adopted in our evolution calculations .",
    "the bh masses were taken to be @xmath6 - more massive bhs were not considered here .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "first , both spectral analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and numerical calculations @xcite have revealed imbh masses within this range .",
    "second , successful circularization of binaries formed by tidal capture is only possible provided that the bh masses are less than a few thousand @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the masses of the donor stars were assumed to be @xmath7 .",
    "these massive stars sink to the center of the clusters together with the bh , and are more likely to be captured by a bh because of their large cross section and close spatial distribution around the bh @xcite .    after in - spiral and circulation ,",
    "the binary separation can be derived from orbital angular momentum conservation to be @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bh mass , @xmath10 and @xmath11 the mass and radius of the companion star , respectively .",
    "the above equation implies that the stellar radius is roughly half of its roche - lobe radius , i.e. , the orbital periods of the incipient binaries are around @xmath12 days .",
    "we have followed the evolution of the binary systems containing an imbh and a massive donor star for the initial parameters given in last section , using an updated version of the evolution code developed by @xcite .",
    "the opacities in the code are from @xcite , and from @xcite for temperatures below @xmath13 k. for the donor star we assumed a solar chemical composition ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and a mixing length parameter @xmath17 . to follow the details of mass transfer process , we included losses of orbital angular momentum due to mass loss and gravitational wave radiation .",
    "we limited the mass accretion rate of the black hole to its eddington limit rate , and let the excess mass be lost from the system with the specific orbital angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "we also assumed that the companion stars are on zero - age main - sequence when they have been captured and settled in a circular orbit .",
    "this means that the time for _ circular _ imbh binary formation is much less than the stellar main - sequence lifetime .",
    "this may not be true for the companion stars more massive than @xmath18 , since the formation history of imbh binaries could be as long as @xmath19 yrs @xcite .",
    "so our results for stars of @xmath20 should be regarded as the most optimistic cases .",
    "figure 1 shows two examples of mass transfer sequences for a binary containing a @xmath21 bh with a 5 and 15 @xmath3 donor star , respectively [ changing the bh masses ( say , to @xmath22 ) does not alter the results considerably ] . in the figure",
    "the mass transfer rates have been converted into x - ray luminosities to be compared with observations .",
    "the x - ray luminosities were calculated according to the slim disk model by @xcite , in which photon trapping effect was included , where @xmath23 is the eddington luminosity , and @xmath24 . ] .",
    "the solid and dashed curves correspond respectively to stable and unstable mass transfer in the accretion disk , according to the criterion given in @xcite .",
    "since the initial binary orbit is too wide for the companion star to fill its roche lobe , the mass transfer through roche - lobe overflow begins until the star evolves and expands after a time labelled below the time - axis in the figure .",
    "the x - ray luminosities are generally around @xmath25 , comparable with those of the most luminous ulxs . however , the stable x - ray lifetime is generally @xmath26 yrs , much shorter than the main - sequence lifetime of the donor stars .",
    "transient behavior usually occurs when the orbits become sufficiently wide .",
    "the absence of extreme long - term variability in ulxs suggests that they are likely to be persistent x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "if it is correct , imbhs can be observed as ulxs at the former part of their evolutions [ at later time the mass transfer rates can also be very high when the donor star is on ( super)giant branch , but with very short duration , see @xcite ] .",
    "there is a dip / gap in the mass transfer rates when the core hydrogen in the star exhausts and the star deviates from thermal equilibrium .",
    "similar features have already been found in the calculations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    for comparison ,",
    "we show in fig.2 the mass transfer sequences for typical smbh x - ray binaries .",
    "the bh mass was assumed to be @xmath27 .",
    "the mass of the donor star was also taken to be 5 and 15 @xmath3 , respectively . in each case",
    "we considered case a and b mass transfer .",
    "it can be seen that there is sufficiently long time ( @xmath28 yrs ) for these binaries to appear as persistent ulxs with @xmath29 , but the x - ray lifetime with @xmath4 is around a few @xmath30 yrs , comparable with and even shorter than that for imbhs .    figure 3 summarizes the evolutions of massive imbh x - ray binaries .",
    "various symbols have been used to describe the states of the binaries : stars , rectangles and triangles represent @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , filled and open symbols indicate stable and unstable mass transfer state , respectively .",
    "the figure demonstrates that imbh binaries , if observed as persistent ulxs , have relatively massive companions in narrow orbits .",
    "this feature is quite similar to those for smbh x - ray binaries @xcite",
    "the purpose of this work is to examine whether the hypothesized imbhs can reproduce the observed properties of ( some of ) the ulxs .",
    "there have been several works on this subject in the literature . in the binary evolution calculations",
    "we have used the results in @xcite on tidal capture to determine the initial conditions for the incipient imbh binaries .",
    "but we allowed stellar expansion before roche - lobe overflow , and got the following results different from theirs : ( 1 ) the donor stars have already evolved off main - sequence when mass transfer begins ; ( 2 ) the x - ray lifetime for imbhs as ulxs is around @xmath34 yr , much shorter than the main - sequence lifetime of the donor stars .",
    "these can present constraints on the donor stars of imbh - ulxs .",
    "for example , the age of the star cluster mgg-11 in the irregular galaxy m82 is @xmath35 myr .",
    "if the ulx m82 x-7 in this cluster @xcite is powered by an imbh of mass @xmath36 , a @xmath37 donor star is required to account for the luminosity and age of the ulx . in a more recent paper ,",
    "@xcite performed detailed binary evolution calculations of @xmath38 stars which transfer mass to a @xmath39 bh .",
    "these authors initialized the binary systems with an ( arbitrarily ) selected orbital period at birth ( ranging from less than a day to a few hundred days ) .",
    "their calculated mass transfer rates and time with initial orbital period of the order of a day are in general agreement with ours .",
    "systematic studies on evolution of smbh x - ray binaries have been carried by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "2 can be regarded as individual cases of their population synthesized results .",
    "we notice that different parameterization for estimating the x - ray luminosities has been adopted here and in their works .",
    "@xcite assumed an energy conversion coefficient depending on the bh spin and let @xmath40 be as high as 10 times of the eddington luminosity , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we have used the results of @xcite , who calculated the emission from the supercritical accretion disk , considering the photon trapping effect .",
    "this difference causes the mass transfer rate to be about 10 times higher in our work ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) than in @xcite , for @xmath40 to reach @xmath25 , for a @xmath27 bh .",
    "the duration of the high - luminosity x - ray emission phase is correspondingly @xmath42 times shorter to be @xmath26 yrs for a massive donor star .    from evolution calculations we have shown that , as ulxs , both imbh and smbh x - ray binaries actually have similar characteristics in their companions stars and binary orbits , which make it difficult to discriminate them observationally .",
    "however , if the donor star is more massive than @xmath43 , the imbh binaries are most likely to reside deeply inside the host star cluster , while smbh binaries generally have been `` kicked '' outside @xcite . for an intermediate- or low - mass donor star , the imbh binaries could be hostless , since the preceding time before mass transfer could be long enough for the cluster to be tidally dispersed , if it is close to the galactic center @xcite .    for the most luminous ulxs with @xmath4 ,",
    "a potential problem related to the smbh model is that , according to @xcite , the effective temperatures of supercritical accretion disks with @xmath41 are still as high as @xmath44 kev , inconsistent with spectral analyzed results for these sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is not known how the temperature profile is in the @xcite disk model .",
    "on the other hand , imbhs have the advantage of low disk temperatures because of their high masses .",
    "we also find that transient behavior is a common feature in late evolutionary stages in these two types of binaries",
    ". it may be difficult to tell imbhs from smbhs by transient behavior , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the differences between our work and @xcite result from the following facts .",
    "( 1 ) we have adopted the bh masses no more than @xmath21 in the calculations . with these values",
    ", one can actually draw from fig .  1 in @xcite the similar results as ours . ( 2 )",
    "we assumed tidal capture as the main formation channel of imbh binaries , from which we got the initial orbital periods of @xmath45 days ; @xcite favor orbital periods in excess of @xmath46 days , but the duration of the mass transfer episode would decrease to be very short ( less than a few @xmath47 yrs ) , making them difficult to be observed .",
    "it should be noted that the calculated mass transfer rates are long - term , averaged ones .",
    "it is unclear how to relate these secular mass transfer rates to observable instantaneous x - ray luminosities , and to disk instability influenced by ( short - term ) mass transfer and x - ray irradiation .",
    "moreover , the mechanisms and criterion for the thermal - viscous instability in irradiated accretion disk are not yet fully understood .",
    "it is premature to predict the instability occurrence from only calculated mass transfer rates .",
    "another interesting feature is that , if anisotropic ( or beamed ) emission is associated with mass transfer rates comparable to the eddington rate , as suggested before ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our calculations indicate that imbhs may also have anisotropic emission , since the mass transfer rates can be sufficiently high to satisfy the condition above",
    ". however , anisotropic x - ray emission is not preferred in our opinion for persistent ulxs , since the most important stabilizing factor for disk instability , the efficiency of x - ray irradiation , will be greatly reduced if the emission is beamed ( usually in the direction perpendicular to the disk plane ) , and the ulxs would become transient sources .",
    "we have calculated the evolutionary sequences of imbh x - ray binaries formed through tidal capture in dense star clusters , and compared the results with those of smbh binaries .",
    "we found that imbhs seem to be capable of explaining the nature of most luminous ulxs , and their companion stars and binary orbits could be similar to those of smbh - ulxs .",
    "we suggest that transient behavior and beamed emission may be not enough to distinguish between imbhs and smbhs .",
