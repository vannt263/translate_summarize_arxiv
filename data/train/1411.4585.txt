    "in the central a few tens parsecs of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the supermassive black holes are fueled by a lot of gas and dust  ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "the dusty clouds obscure a significant fraction of the sky of the central engines , and re - emit the absorbed energy mainly in mid - infrared ( mir ) .",
    "mir observation therefore provides a powerful approach to infer the currently unclear geometric and physical properties of the dusty structure . due to the angular momentum ,",
    "the dusty gas likely forms a geometrically and optically thick torus .",
    "popular models include the so - called homogeneous torus model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the clumpy torus model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to the unification scheme @xcite , type 1 and type 2 agns ( hereafter type1s and type2s ) are believed viewed along different inclination angles respect to the torus . as various torus models predict different levels of anisotropy in mir emission from the torus , comparing the mir radiation in type1s and type2s therefore could distinguish these models .",
    "it turns out that the homogenous torus model is disfavored since the mir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of type1s and type2s generally show only mild difference , much weaker than expected from the homogenous torus model  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , these mir spectra and seds are well fitted by the clumpy torus models which instead predict low to moderate level of anisotropy in mir emission @xcite .    quantifying the anisotropy in mir observationally",
    "is essential to constrain the physical parameters of the torus models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported that the average ratio of 10.6 @xmath0 to 1.4 ghz radio flux densities in type1s is larger by a factor of @xmath3 4.0 than in type2s .",
    "similarly , @xcite explored the mir anisotropy in seyfert galaxies with spitzer spectra after normalizing to 8.4 ghz radio emission .",
    "they found type1s are brighter than type2s by a factor of @xmath3 7 at 5 @xmath0 , and the factor of the difference gradually drops to @xmath3 2 at 35 @xmath0 .",
    "these studies suggest mild anisotropy of the mir radiation in seyfert galaxies , as the optical thin radio emission is believed an isotropic indicator of the intrinsic agns accretion power  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , type 1 and type 2 agns appear to follow statistically the same tight mir ",
    "x - ray correlation  @xcite , suggesting the mir emission is highly isotropic assuming the hard x - ray emission in agns is inclination independent . in this case , only tight upper limit to the anisotropy of mir emission can be obtained , even with a rather large agn sample containing 155 sources  @xcite , contrary to the studies above which show that mir emission is mildly anisotropic .",
    "we argue this discrepancy is due to that the hard x - ray emission in agns is also mildly anisotropic . adopting [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  emission line as an isotropic agn luminosity indicator  @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) found both absorption corrected 2  10 kev and swift bat 14  195 kev emission in compton - thin type2s are weaker than in type1s by a factor of 2 @xmath3 3 .",
    "this indicates the hard x - ray radiation in radio quiet agns is anisotropic , likely due to the beaming effect of an outflowing x - ray emitting corona .",
    "therefore , hard x - ray emission is likely not a good option to quantifying the moderate anisotropy in mir emission in agns . in this work for the first time we utilize the [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  emission line as the intrinsic luminosity proxy to measure the anisotropy of mir 12@xmath0  emission in nearby agns .",
    "in paper i , we have compiled a large sample of radio quiet agns with [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  line fluxes measured by spitzer infrared spectrometer from five major samples in literature @xcite .",
    "we match the [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  catalog to the largest local agn mir photometry catalog @xcite .",
    "@xcite used all available sub - arcsecond resolution mir imaging and measured the unresolved nuclear fluxes instead of aperture fluxes to minimize the contribution of possible extended emission . since our scientific goal is to study the mir emission in typical agns , all liners in the sample",
    "were dropped . as the jet in radio loud agns can contribute to mir radiation , we also excluded known radio loud sources .",
    "the final sample includes 34 type 1 agns ( including seyfert 1 , seyfert 1.2 and seyfert 1.5 galaxies , and a couple of type 1 quasars ) and 47 type 2 agns ( including seyfert 1.8 , seyfert 1.9 and seyfert 2 ) that have both [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  and 12@xmath0  luminosities .",
    "we note that dropping the quasars from our sample does not alter the results presented in this work .",
    "the typical resolution of the 12@xmath0  imaging observations is 0.3  @xcite .",
    "as the mean distance in log space is 82 ( 38 ) mpc for type1s ( type2s ) , with 1@xmath4 scatter 0.5 ( 0.4 ) dex , the mean size of region probed by 12@xmath0  imaging is 119 ( 56 ) parsecs for type1s ( type2s ) . at region",
    "scales about 50 - 100 parsecs , mir spectroscopy observations of nearby agns show strongly reduced or undetected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission compared to spectroscopy in a few hundreds parsecs to kiloparsecs scales @xcite . as pah emission is an indicator of the nuclear star formation activities , weak pah emission suggests star formation has limited contribution to 12@xmath0  emission .",
    "therefore the 12@xmath0  emission mainly comes from dust in the center of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the final matched sample is shown in table 1 .",
    "we note that this sample is neither complete nor homogeneous .",
    "possible bias which may affect the results in this study is discussed in  3 .",
    "we first plot the 12@xmath0  versus [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  luminosity in fig .",
    "1 . we see that the 12@xmath0  radiation strongly correlates to the [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  for both type1s and type2s .",
    "the significance of the correlation , according to the spearman rank coefficient @xmath5 , is @xmath6 at a null significance level of @xmath7 .",
    "an intrinsic flux - flux correlation is also present , with @xmath8 at a null significance level of @xmath9 .",
    "however , the 12@xmath0  emissions at given [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  luminosities are remarkably weaker in type2s than in type1s .",
    "to statistically quantifying the difference in the 12@xmath0  luminosities between type1s and type2s , we first perform a linear fit to the relations on the total sample and subsamples of type1s and type2s , taking [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  as the independent variable .",
    "we only consider 12@xmath0  luminosity uncertainties in the analysis , as only part of the sample have [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  luminosities errors which are rather small ( typical error is 5% ) .",
    "the best - fitted lines are : @xmath10",
    "we then perform k - s test on the residuals ( data points of 12@xmath0  luminosities minus the best - fit line of total sample , see fig .",
    "1 ) of type1s and type2s . at a confidence level of 99.8%",
    ", they are not drawn from the same population .",
    "the difference of the average residuals between type1s and type2s is 0.4 dex , thus type1s are brighter in 12@xmath0   ( at given [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  luminosities ) by a factor of @xmath2 than type2s , suggesting mild anisotropy in mir radiation .",
    "we note that the statistical results on the difference between type1s and type2s are not sensitive to the linear - fit approach we utilized .",
    "for instance , the orthogonal distance regression yields slightly different correlation slopes in 12@xmath0  versus [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0 , but the resulted difference in the relative strength of 12@xmath0  emission between type1s and type2s remains unchanged , i.e. , type1s are brighter in 12@xmath0   by a factor of @xmath2 than type2s at a confidence level of 99.9% .    before looking into the underlying physics",
    ", we examine whether this difference could be artificial due to possible bias of the analysis .",
    "we first consider bias of the [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  sample collection .",
    "the sources in the matched sample all have high resolution spitzer irs spectra .",
    "as type2s in the sample tend to have smaller redshifts / distances than type1s , possible slit loss might have underestimated the [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  fluxes more severely in type2s comparing with type1s , correcting which would instead strengthen the difference we have detected .",
    "we refer the readers to  4.2 in paper i for more and thorough discussions on possible bias and the isotropy of [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0 .    during the analysis ,",
    "we have excluded 3 sources ( all are type2s ) with [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  upper limits and 5 sources ( all are type2s ) with 12@xmath0  upper limits . including these upper limits with survival analysis yields consistent results , i.e. , type1s are brighter in 12@xmath0   by a factor of 2.8 than type2s at a confidence level of 99.95% .",
    "we note there are 7 type 1.8 and type 1.9 agns in our sample , for which optical classifications may be not robust .",
    "excluding these 7 sources from the sample does not change the results in this work . simply classifying them as type 1 agns",
    "yield statistically the same results .",
    "could the difference between type1s and type2s shown in fig . 1 be due to star formation contribution to [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  as some works claimed that seyfert 2 may have higher star formation in their host galaxies ( maiolino et al .",
    "1995 ; buchanan et al . 2006",
    "; but see imanishi & wada 2004 ) ? comparing with [ oiii ] @xmath15007 , [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  emission line has higher ionization potential ( 54.9 ev ) thus is less affected by contamination from star formation in the host galaxy .",
    "the contamination to [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  from star formation in the host galaxies is rather weak @xcite and the [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  in seyfert galaxies and quasars is generally dominated by the agn . as shown in @xcite the star formation contribution to [ oiv ]",
    "@xmath125.89@xmath0  is much weaker at higher [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  luminosity and could be significant at l @xmath13 10@xmath14 erg  s@xmath15 .",
    "the fraction of agns with l @xmath13 10@xmath14 erg  s@xmath15 is 22% . dropping those sources with l @xmath13 10@xmath14 erg  s@xmath15",
    "give statistically similar results : type1s are brighter in 12@xmath0   by a factor of @xmath16 than type2s at a confidence level of 99.96% .",
    "therefore the result in work can not be explained by possible contamination to [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  from the host galaxies .",
    "finally , if there is any potential bias which could yield a spurious difference in the relative strength of 12@xmath0   between type1s and type2s as we observed , we should have missed type1s with relatively weaker 12@xmath0  emission , and/or type2s with relatively weaker [ oiv ] @xmath125.89@xmath0  emission .",
    "bias against sources with relatively brighter emission in one band is unlikely as astronomical observations are generally flux limited .",
    "it is however rather puzzling if any such bias works preferentially on type1s but not type2s , or vice versa .",
    "we conclude that although the sample is not complete or homogeneous , our major results in this work are not affected .",
    "the mild anisotropy in mir radiation , as detected in previous studies @xcite , is confirmed by this work .",
    "particularly , the level of the anisotropy at 12@xmath0  we detected ( by a factor of 2.6 ) is in good agreement with fig . 16 in @xcite at the same wavelength , which was however based on spitzer spectra with lower spatial resolution comparing with this work .    given that the x - ray emission is also mildly anisotropic ( paper i ) , the mild anisotropy in mir radiation we detected is also consistent with the picture that type1s and type2s follow the same tight correlation between mir and x - ray intrinsic luminosities  @xcite .",
    "we quantitatively compare our results with two popular radiative transfer modelings of clumpy torus : clumpy  @xcite and cat3d  @xcite .",
    "both models assume thermal equilibrium of dust with radiation of agns .",
    "the models compute the dust radiation with a range of model parameters ( table 1 ) , including the optical opacity @xmath17 in v band of each cloud , the torus outer radius y ( y = @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is dust sublimation radius ) , the average number of clouds along the radial equatorial line n@xmath20 , the power - law index of clouds radial distribution q , and half covering angle @xmath21 ( see  @xcite and @xcite for more details on the parameters ) . both models considered a gaussian angular distribution of the clouds @xmath22exp(@xmath23 , where @xmath21 is the half covering angle , and @xmath24 is the angle of the line of sight from the equatorial plane .",
    "both models generate sed grids for different sets of those parameters . using these sed grids",
    ", we explore in which region in the parameter space the torus 12@xmath0  radiation is mildly anisotropic as we observed .",
    "opacity per single cloud in v band & @xmath17 & 60 & 50 , 80 + torus outer radius @xmath18 & y & 100 & 150 + clouds along radial equatorial rays & n@xmath20 & [ 2 , 15 ] & [ 2.5 , 10 ] + clouds radial distribution @xmath25 & q & [ -3 , 0 ] & [ -2 , 0 ] + half covering angle & @xmath21 & [ 15@xmath26 , 60@xmath26 ] & 45@xmath26        first , to compare emission of torus with different q and n@xmath20 , we take sed grids with parameters set to the model best - fit results of mir spectra : @xmath21 = @xmath28 , @xmath17 = 60 ( 50 , 80 ) , and y = 100 ( 150 ) in clumpy ( cat3d ) model @xcite , and explore how n@xmath20 and q influence the anisotropy of 12@xmath0  radiation . in clumpy torus models , the classification as type 1 or type 2 is probabilistic .",
    "we use the escape probability defined in @xcite to calculate the average inclination angles of type 1 and type 2 agns ( escape probability is defined as @xmath29 , while @xmath30 is the cloud number at the viewing line of sight ) , for instance , adopting @xmath21 = @xmath28 and n@xmath20=5.0 ( the escape probability is @xmath31 where i is the inclination angle ) , we obtained an average inclination angle of @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively for type 1 and type 2 agns ( the escape probabilities at the average inclination angles are 18.4% and 0.1% for type1s and type2s ) .",
    "we roughly estimate the anisotropy as the ratio of 12@xmath0  flux viewed at the average inclination angles of type1s and type2s . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the anisotropy increases when the index of cloud radial distribution q is flatter and the clouds numbers n is larger , consistent with figure 10 in @xcite .",
    "we then explore how the parameter half covering angle @xmath21 of the torus affects the anisotropy in dust emission .",
    "we adopt clumpy sed model as it provides more grids of the physical parameters .",
    "we set n@xmath20 = 7 , @xmath17 = 60 , and y = 100 .",
    "we compute the average inclination angles of type1s and type2s for different @xmath21 and estimate the anisotropy as the ratio of 12@xmath0  flux viewed at the respective average inclination angle . as shown in fig .",
    "2c , the anisotropy increases when the half covering angle @xmath21 is smaller .    by fitting a sample of agn seds with clumpy torus model ,",
    "an interesting finding @xcite suggests type 1 and type 2 agns have a statistical difference in the half covering angle of the torus , but similar probability distributions of the viewing angles . in this case",
    ", we assume different half covering angles for two types ( @xmath21 = 30@xmath26 for type1s and @xmath21 =",
    "60@xmath26 for type2s ) , but the same average viewing angle of 50@xmath26 .",
    "we set @xmath34 = -1.0 .",
    "the result shows that in this scheme , the observed anisotropy could also be reproduced with n@xmath20 = 10  15 .",
    "note that with much smaller @xmath35 , we would expect opposite anisotropy that type2s are brighter in mir than type1s , due to its larger covering angle of the dusty torus .    as there is degeneracy among the torus parameters which affect the anisotropy , in this work we are unable to give accurate constraints to individual parameters .",
    "the anisotropy of a factor of @xmath3 2.6 in dust mir 12@xmath0  radiation requires a large n@xmath20 and/or a flat q and/or a small @xmath21 .",
    "those parameter ranges are generally consistent with the best - fit results to mir spectra @xcite , particularly @xcite and @xcite which include both type 1 and type 2 seyferts .",
    "we conclude that the mild anisotropy we observed in mir emission is fully consistent with modern clumpy torus models .",
    "although it is a popular picture that the dust mir emission in agns is dominated by radiation from the clumpy torus , it is challenged by recent mir interferometric observations .",
    "infrared interferometry observations of 4 nearby agns ( circinus , ngc1068 , ngc424 , ngc3783 ) at sub - pc resolution suggested that , instead of the torus , the major contributor of mir emission is dust in the polar region  @xcite . assuming all agns contain polar region dust , the dust emission in polar region will likely dilute the anisotropic emission from the torus .",
    "the level of the dilution is however hard to estimate .",
    "the anisotropy of total 12@xmath0  emission depends on the contribution from both the torus and the polar region .",
    "the polar region mir emission is also likely different between type1s and type2s as the sky coverage of the polar region is likely larger in type1s due to selection effect ( sources with smaller sky coverage of the dusty torus thus larger sky coverage of the polar region are more likely detected as type1s . ) .",
    "this effect may have played a role in producing the observed mir anisotropy in agns if the polar region component dominate the mir emission .",
    "we note that if type1s have more 12@xmath0  emission from torus ( relative to that from the polar region ) than type2s , i.e , the anisotropy in the mir emission is dominated by the torus but not the polar region , the mir emission from type1s should appear more compact .",
    "recently , the mir interferometry observations of a sample of agns showed that type1s have a larger fraction of emission concentrated in the central unresolved point sources  @xcite , which seems consistent with this diagram .",
