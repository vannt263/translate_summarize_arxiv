    "brownian motion is perhaps one of the most widely studied subjects in classical physics . a brownian walker moves in continuous space and time which leads to a great simplification : one can write down a simple differential equation , the famous diffusion equation , that governs the time development of the probability density of the position of the walker .",
    "subsequently , many other involved properties of the brownian motion , such as its first - passage probability through a given point , the distribution of the maximum displacement of the walker up to a given time etc . can be calculated analytically relatively easily@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the related problem of a random walker that hops only at discrete time steps in a continuous space is not so straightforward , even in one dimension@xcite .",
    "a classic example of such a walk can be found in bacterial chemotaxis , where a bacteria , in search of food , jumps from one position to another at discrete time steps@xcite .",
    "another famous example of such a walk occurs in the rouse model of a polymer chain that consists of monomers or beads connected by harmonic springs@xcite .",
    "many other examples can be found in refs .",
    "while the asymptotic properties of this discrete hopper , after a sufficiently large number of steps and given that the variance in step sizes is finite , are correctly described by the continuous time diffusion equation@xcite , there are many interesting finite size effects that can not be captured by the diffusion equation .",
    "the difficulty that arises in dealing with a finite number of steps is due to the fact that the probability density of the random hopper usually satisfies an integral equation which is technically much harder to solve than a differential equation . in this paper",
    ", we study analytically one such finite size effect , namely the behavior of the expected maximum position of a discrete time hopper in one dimension .",
    "we will show that even this relatively simple problem has rather interesting finite size behavior .",
