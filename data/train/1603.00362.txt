    "for most of its history , numerical relativity , i.e. ,  the construction of solutions to einstein s field equations with numerical methods , was mainly motivated by the modeling of compact objects as sources of gravitational waves@xcite for ground based [ laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) , virgo ] and space based [ laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) ] detectors ; see for example @xcite .",
    "following the breakthroughs in black - hole ( bh ) binary simulations in 2005 @xcite , however , the field rapidly expanded into a variety of new physics frontiers @xcite .",
    "these applications often involve higher - dimensional spacetimes where bhs are known from ( semi-)analytic studies to exhibit a richer phenomenology as for example through the existence of topologically non - spherical horizons or gravitational instabilities @xcite . despite considerable progress through analytic , perturbative and numerical methods ,",
    "our understanding of the properties of these higher - dimensional bhs is still a long way from the level of maturity obtained in the four - dimensional case .",
    "yet , applications of numerical relativity to bhs in @xmath5 have already revealed a plethora of exciting results .",
    "critical spin parameters have been identified above which myers - perry bhs become unstable to bar mode perturbations and migrate to more slowly spinning bhs via gw emission . @xcite .",
    "the celebrated gregory - laflamme instability@xcite has been shown to lead to the formation of naked singularities in finite asymptotic time in numerical simulations of black strings in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "@xcite most recently , a similar behaviour has been identified in evolutions of thin black rings demonstrating the first violation of cosmic censorship for a generic type of asymptotically flat initial data @xcite ; see also @xcite for a perturbative study .",
    "applications of the gauge - gravity duality often consider @xmath6 dimensional bhs in asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes such that the dual conformal field theory ( cft ) lives on the @xmath7 dimensional ( conformal ) boundary of the spacetime .",
    "applications of this ads / cft correspondence include the thermalization of quark - gluon plasma , turbulence or jet quenching in heavy - ion collisions ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "bh collisions provide fertile ground for numerical relativity in higher dimensions .",
    "first , we obtain unprecedented insight into the dynamics of general relativity in its most violent , non - linear regime .",
    "furthermore , the so - called tev gravity scenarios provide solutions to the hierarchy problem in terms of large ( @xmath8 sub millimeter ) extra dimensions @xcite or infinite extra dimensions with a warp factor @xcite which are accessible to gravity but no other standard - model interactions .",
    "if correct , these theories open up the possibility of bh formation in particle collisions or in cosmic ray showers @xcite .",
    "valuable input for the analysis of experimental data at the large hadron collider includes the scattering cross - section and energy loss in gws .",
    "numerical relativity has provided us with a rather comprehensive understanding of these collisions in @xmath7 @xcite , which the community now starts extending to higher @xmath0 @xcite . for more details on these new areas in numerical relativity research",
    "see @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of bh spacetimes in higher dimensions are a challenging task . first and foremost this is simply a consequence of the required computational resources .",
    "simulations in @xmath7 require of the order of @xmath9 cores and @xmath10 of memory .",
    "each extra spatial dimension introduces an additional factor of @xmath9 grid points and correspondingly more memory and floating point operations . even with modern high - performance computing systems ,",
    "this sets practical limits on the feasibility of accurately evolving higher - dimensional spacetimes . at the same time , many of the outstanding questions can be addressed by imposing symmetry assumptions on the spacetimes in question such as planar symmetry in modeling asymptotically ads spacetimes @xcite , cylindrical symmetry for black strings @xcite or different types of rotational symmetries @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved in practice by either ( i ) using a specific form of the line element that directly imposes the symmetry in question ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , ( ii ) starting with a generic line element and applying dimensional reduction through isometry ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or ( iii ) implementing the symmetry through a so - called _ cartoon method _ @xcite .",
    "here we are concerned with the latter approach and , more specifically , with a modification thereof originally introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which we will henceforth refer to as the _ modified cartoon method_.    this article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cartoon ] , we introduce the notation used throughout our work , and illustrate the modified cartoon implementation of the symmetries for a specific example . in sec .  [",
    "sec : bssndelta ] we introduce the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura@xcite ( bssn ) evolution system we use for the einstein equations , and derive their specific form in @xmath1 symmetry when rotational symmetry is present in @xmath11 planes which corresponds to @xmath12 .",
    "the axisymmetric case @xmath2 imposes less restrictive conditions on the vanishing of tensor density components and their derivatives and the particulars of its numerical implementation are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : so2 ] .",
    "as an example , we present in sec .  [",
    "sec : application ] numerical simulations of a bh head - on collision in @xmath3 dimensions employing @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] and include in three appendices a list of important relations for the components of tensors and derived quantities as well as the regularization necessary at the origin in the quasi - radial direction .",
    "it is instructive to illustrate the method by considering first a simpler scenario : axisymmetry in three spatial dimensions .",
    "let @xmath13 denote cartesian coordinates and assume rotational symmetry about the @xmath14 axis and use symmetry about the @xmath15 axis , but our choice of labels emphasizes more clearly the analogy to the higher - dimensional case . ]",
    "i.e. ,  there exists a rotational killing field in the @xmath16 plane .",
    "evidently , the geometry of such a three - dimensional manifold can be constructed straightforwardly provided all tensors ( e.g.  the metric ) are known on the semi infinite plane @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "we note the simplification in the computational task : the @xmath20 coordinate has dropped out and the quasi - radius @xmath15 takes on only non - negative values , reducing an originally three - dimensional computational domain to a calculation on half of @xmath21 .",
    "this is the case considered in the original papers @xcite .",
    "the most common applications will likely consider higher - dimensional spacetimes with @xmath22 symmetry , but here we present the general application to a @xmath0 dimensional spacetime with @xmath1 symmetry , where @xmath23 .",
    "let us then consider a @xmath0 dimensional spacetime consisting of a manifold @xmath24 and a metric @xmath25 of signature @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "we assume the spacetime to obey @xmath1 symmetry and introduce cartesian coordinates by @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath1 symmetry implies the existence of rotational killing vectors in each plane spanned by two of the coordinates @xmath30 . in complete analogy with the axisymmetric scenario discussed above , it is now sufficient to provide data on the @xmath31-dimensional semi - infinite hyperplane @xmath32 , @xmath18 .",
    "the components of a tensor at any point in the spacetime can then be obtained by appropriately rotating data from the hyperplane onto the point in question .    in modeling spacetimes with such symmetries , it is therefore entirely sufficient to compute data on the hyperplane which largely solves the problem of increased computational cost mentioned in the introduction",
    ". there remains , however , the difficulty that the einstein equations , irrespective of the specific formulation one chooses , contain derivatives of tensor components in the @xmath33 directions which can not be evaluated numerically in the usual fashion , as for example using finite differences or spectral methods . furthermore , the number of tensor components present in the einstein equations still increases rapidly with the dimension parameter @xmath0 resulting in a substantial increase of memory requirements and floating point operations . both of these difficulties are overcome by exploiting the conditions imposed on the tensor components and their derivatives by the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "it is these conditions which we address next .",
    "it turns out to be convenient in this discussion to distinguish between ( 1 ) the case @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath34 isometry , and ( 2 ) all remaining cases @xmath35 .",
    "we defer discussion of the special case @xmath2 to sec .",
    "[ sec : so2 ] where we present a numerical treatment specifically designed for conveniently dealing with it .",
    "the description of this treatment will be simpler after first handling the class of symmetries with @xmath35 which we discuss in the remainder of this and in the next section .",
    "the key ingredient we use in reducing the number of independent tensor components and relating their derivatives are the rotational killing vectors and the use of coordinates adapted to the integral curves of these killing vectors .",
    "the method is best introduced by considering a concrete example .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the killing vector field corresponding to the rotational symmetry in the @xmath37 plane , where @xmath38 for some fixed number @xmath39 .",
    "we introduce a new coordinate system that replaces @xmath37 with cylindrical coordinates and leaves all other coordinates unchanged , @xmath40 in these coordinates , the killing field is @xmath41 and the vanishing of the lie derivative @xmath42 implies @xmath43 .",
    "note that quantities constructed from the spacetime metric directly inherit this property .",
    "this applies , in particular , to the arnowitt - deser - misner@xcite ( adm )  see also @xcite  and the bssn variables widely used in numerical relativity . for @xmath35",
    ", one can furthermore show that the @xmath44 component of a vector field and those components of a tensor field @xmath45 , where exactly one index is @xmath44 , vanish represents an exception ; an axisymmetric , toroidal magnetic field , for example , satisfies @xmath34 symmetry , but has a non - vanishing @xmath44 component . ] .",
    "the concrete example we now discuss in more detail concerns a symmetric tensor density @xmath45 of weight @xmath46 and , in particular , the mixed components @xmath47 , where the index @xmath48 stands for any one of the @xmath49 coordinates and @xmath20 stands for one of the @xmath33 .",
    "we first consider the components @xmath50 for some fixed value of @xmath51 .",
    "transforming the component @xmath52 to cartesian coordinates , one gets @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the jacobian @xmath55 . using that @xmath56 by symmetry",
    ", this equation implies @xmath57 similarly , transforming @xmath58 to cartesian coordinates and using that @xmath59 by symmetry , one straightforwardly gets @xmath60 recalling that the computational domain is the hyperplane @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath18 , we conclude from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : txyw]),([eq : tzw ] ) that on the computational domain @xmath63 .",
    "this argument holds for any specific choice of the coordinate @xmath20 , so that we conclude @xmath64 to compute the derivatives with respect to @xmath20 on the @xmath17 hyperplane , one can proceed as follows . for the tensor components in the example",
    "above , one can simply use and to calculate @xmath65 and then set @xmath17 . alternatively , writing the killing field @xmath36 as @xmath66 and imposing the vanishing of the lie derivative @xmath67 on the @xmath17 hyperplane , one gets @xmath68 repeating this process for all components of scalar , vector and rank 2 tensor densities as well as their first and second derivatives , we get the relations summarized in [ app : cartoon ] .    we have shown the calculation here explicitly for the case of tensor densities .",
    "it can be shown that the vectorial expressions thus obtained also apply to the contracted christoffel symbol @xmath69 constructed from the metric , even though it is not a vector density .",
    "in this section , we will apply the symmetry relations obtained above to the specific case of the bssn formulation of the einstein equations in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the procedure spelled out here for the bssn system can be applied in similar form to any of the alternative popular formulations used in numerical relativity .",
    "the starting point for the bssn formulation is a space - time , or @xmath70 , split where the spacetime is foliated in terms of a one - parameter family of @xmath71 dimensional , spatial hypersurfaces . in coordinates adapted to this split ,",
    "the line element takes on the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 denote the lapse function and shift vector , respectively .",
    "the adm equations in the form developed by york@xcite then result in one hamiltonian constraint , @xmath71 momentum constraints and @xmath76 second - order evolution equations for the spatial metric components @xmath77 .",
    "the latter are formulated as a first - order - in - time system by introducing the extrinsic curvature @xmath78 through @xmath79 space - time decompositions of the einstein equations typically split the energy momentum tensor analogously into time , space and mixed components according to @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the future pointing , timelike unit normal field on the spatial hypersurfaces .",
    "the complete set of the adm equations , thus obtained , can be found as eqs .",
    "( 52)-(55 ) in @xcite .",
    "the bssn system is obtained from the adm equations by applying a conformal transformation to the spatial metric , a trace split of the extrinsic curvature and promotion of the contracted spatial christoffel symbols to the status of evolution variables .",
    "the bssn variables are defined as @xmath82    & \\tilde{\\upgamma}^{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{i } } } } = \\tilde{\\gamma}^{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{m}}}{{\\scriptscriptstyle{n } } } }          \\tilde{\\upgamma}^{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{i}}}}_{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{m}}}{{\\scriptscriptstyle{n}}}}\\ , , &    \\label{eq : bssnvars}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are the christoffel symbols associated with the conformal metric @xmath85 .",
