    "integration of renewable energy sources into communication networks is a hot research topic .",
    "it provides significant energy gains and is an efficient green communication solution for the expected future data traffic increase .",
    "traditional renewable energy sources such as solar energy and wind depend on the weather conditions and are characterized by high instability ; the integration of these energy sources requires a fundamental re - design of communications systems in all levels of protocol stack in order to ensure robustness and reliability @xcite .",
    "several works consider conventional renewable energy resources and study optimal resource allocation techniques for different objective functions and network topologies e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the intermittent and unpredictable nature of these energy sources makes energy harvesting ( eh ) critical for applications where quality - of - service ( qos ) is of paramount importance . on the other hand , recently there is a lot of interest to use electromagnetic radiation as a potential renewable energy resource .",
    "the key idea of this concept is that electromagnetic ( em ) waves convey energy , which can be converted to dc - voltage by using specific rectenna circuits @xcite .",
    "most of the work on radio - frequency ( rf ) energy transfer concerns the design of rectenna circuits in different frequency bands , which is a fundamental aspect towards the development of this technology @xcite . from an information theoretic standpoint , evaluating the channel capacity for different network configurations , when rf eh requirements characterize the receiver nodes , is a challenging problem .",
    "the work in @xcite discusses the joint transfer of information and energy for a single - input single - output ( siso ) channel and is extended in @xcite for a set of parallel point - to - point channels ; the authors in @xcite study the capacity for two baseline multi - user systems with rf energy constraints , namely multiple access and multihop channels .",
    "however , information theoretic studies assume that the receivers are able to decode information and harvest energy from the same rf signal without limitations .",
    "although this assumption provides some useful theoretical bounds , it can not be supported by the current practical implementations .    in order to satisfy the above practical limitation , the work in @xcite deals with the beamforming design for a basic broadcast multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channel , where the source conveys information to one receiver and transfers energy to the other one . in that work ,",
    "the authors introduce two main practical techniques for simultaneous information and power transfer ( swipt ) : a ) `` time switching '' ( ts ) , where the receiver switches between decoding information and harvesting energy and b ) `` power splitting '' ( ps ) , where the receiver splits the received rf signal in two parts for decoding information and harvesting energy , respectively .",
    "this work is extended in @xcite for imperfect channel information at the transmitter using robust optimization .",
    "the employment of the above two practical approaches in different fundamental network structures , is a hot research topic and several recent works appear in the literature .",
    "the works in @xcite focus on the ts technique for different network topologies .",
    "specifically , in @xcite the authors investigate the optimal switching strategy for a siso channel in order to achieve various trade - offs between wireless information transfer and eh with / without channel state information ( csi ) knowledge at the transmitter .",
    "the work in @xcite presents a time division multiple access ( tdma)-based multiuser broadcast channel where the downlink ( broadcast channel ) is used for eh while the uplink for conveying information from the users to the access point . in @xcite , the authors apply the ts technique for a basic relay channel and investigate the optimal switching rule .",
    "a ts switching architecture is proposed in @xcite for a multiple - input single - output ( miso ) system , where the single - antenna receiver uses its harvested energy to feed a quantized csi . on the other hand ,",
    "in @xcite the authors study the performance of a cooperative system , where the relay is powered by employing a ps technique on the received signal .",
    "the work in @xcite studies the optimal transmitted power for a miso interference channel with ps where the destinations have both information / energy constraints .",
    "the ts and ps techniques have also been exploited in cognitive radio networks to achieve joint information and energy cooperation between a primary and a secondary system , resulting in improved performance for both systems due to the added rf eh capabilities @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors in @xcite take into account the energy consumption of the active electronic circuits ( e.g. , mixers ) and they propose an integrated receiver architecture , where ps is employed at the baseband domain .",
    "a recent overview of swipt systems with a particular focus on the hardware realization of rectenna circuits and practical techniques that achieve swipt in the domains of time , power and antennas is provided in @xcite .",
    "although most of the previous studies refer to specific and fix network topologies , more recent works study ts / ps for large scale networks with location randomness .",
    "in @xcite , the authors study the interaction between primary and cognitive radio networks , where cognitive radio nodes can harvest energy from the primary transmissions , by modeling node locations as poisson point processes .",
    "a cooperative network with multiple transmitter - receiver pairs and a single eh relay is studied in @xcite by taking the spatial randomness of user locations into consideration . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the performance of a large scale ad hoc network with / without relaying where receivers have ps capabilities .",
    "in contrast to the conventional ts and ps approaches , we propose a new technique for swipt in the spatial domain for a basic point - to - point mimo channel . in this work ,",
    "spatial domain does not refer to the antenna elements @xcite but mainly on the spatial degrees of freedom of the channel .",
    "based on the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the mimo channel , the communication link is transformed to parallel channels that can convey either information data or energy ; this binary allocation is in respect to the current practical limitations . in order to make our analysis more general ( and practical ) , we assume an imperfect channel estimation that affects the orthogonality of the eigenchannels ( the imperfect channel knowledge generates an interference to the eigenchannels ) .",
    "we study the minimization of the transmitted power when the receiver is characterized by maximum power per eigenchannel , information rate and power transfer constraints which is a mixed - integer nonlinear optimization problem and propose several solution methods .",
    "it is worth noting that the main purpose of this work is to introduce a new technique for swipt in mimo systems ; this technique is studied from a theoretical standpoint and practical implementation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "more specifically , the contributions of this paper are :    * construction of mixed - integer second - order cone programing ( misocp ) and mixed - integer linear programming ( milp ) formulations to the general problem that can be solved using standard optimization tools to provide optimal and near - optimal solutions , respectively . *",
    "development of an optimal polynomial complexity algorithm for the solution of the special problem of having no maximum power per eigenchannel constraints . a low complexity polynomial algorithm is also developed for the general problem with excellent performance . * derivation of a waterfilling - like procedure for the solution of the optimal power allocation problem with fixed eigenchannel assignment , of low polynomial complexity .",

    "the source is connected to a constant power supply while the destination has rf transfer capabilities and can harvest energy from the received electromagnetic radiation .",
    "we consider a flat fading spatially uncorrelated rayleigh mimo channel where @xmath16 denotes the channel matrix .",
    "the channel remains constant during one transmission time - slot and changes independently from one slot to the next .",
    "the entries of @xmath17 are assumed to be independent , zero - mean circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( zmcscg ) random variables with unit variance ( which ensures @xmath18 ) .",

    "we assume that the channel matrix is subject to a channel estimation error and therefore is _ imperfectly _ known at both the transmitter and the receiver with a mmse estimation error @xmath23 , where the entries of @xmath24 are zmcscg with variance @xmath25 and the entries of @xmath26 are also independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) zmcscg with variance @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the channel estimation is performed at the destination via a downlink pilot sequence and is communicated to the source by using an uplink feedback channel ; the channel estimation process is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note that the parameter @xmath25 captures the quality of the channel estimation and is assumed to be known to both the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "the work in @xcite provides some examples for @xmath25 related to different channel estimation schemes and channel statistics ; in this paper , we assume that @xmath25 is a constant without further implications . based on the estimated channel @xmath26 , a lower bound of the instantaneous mutual information is given by @xcite @xmath28    it is worth noting that for @xmath29 ( perfect channel knowledge ) , the above expression gives the exact mutual information of the mimo channel . by using the svd of the @xmath26 channel ,",
    "it has been proven in @xcite that the lower bound of the mutual information is maximized when @xmath30 and takes the form @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , is the @xmath34-th eigenvalue of @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the power allocated to the @xmath34-th eigenchannel and @xmath37 .",

    "this bound can be achieved using svd on the estimated matrix @xmath26 and by appropriate precoding and receiver shaping at the source and the destination , respectively .",
    "[ model_svd ] schematically presents the system model and the transformation of the mimo channel to @xmath39 eigenchannels for potential transfer of information / energy .",
    "we show the svd coordinate transformations when the matrix @xmath40 has a svd equal to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are unitary matrices and @xmath44 is a diagonal matrix with elements the singular values of the matrix @xmath40 i.e. , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . based on the svd , the channel input @xmath1 comes from the transformation of the original sequence @xmath48 with the matrix @xmath49 while the received sequence @xmath50 is transformed to the sequence @xmath51 by using the matrix @xmath52 . in the ideal case",
    "where @xmath29 , the mimo channel is decomposed to @xmath39 parallel siso channels with @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the awgn for the @xmath34-th parallel channel and has the same distribution with @xmath55 ( due to the unitary transformation ) in reception .    the expression in shows that the imperfect channel estimation generates an interference to the @xmath39 parallel siso channels ( eigenchannels ) .",
    "we assume that the destination is characterized by both information rate and rf eh requirements ; this means that for the duration of one transmission the destination requires an information rate @xmath56 and energy @xmath57 as input to its rectenna circuits ( the amount of energy that can be stored , @xmath58 , depends on the energy conversion efficiency of the specific implementation , @xmath59 ) e.g. , @xcite . for simplicity and without loss of generality",
    "we assume in the mathematical analysis that @xmath60 .",
    "the proposed scheme exploits the svd structure of the mimo channel and achieves swipt in the spatial domain .",
    "more specifically , the transformation of the mimo channel to @xmath39 parallel siso channels allows the simultaneous transfer of data traffic and rf energy by using an eigenchannel either to convey information or energy .",
    "an eigenchannel can not be used to convey both information and energy ; this limitation refers to practical constraints and is inline with the other approaches proposed in the literature , e.g. power splitting .",
    "based on the diagram in fig .",
    "[ model_svd ] , at the output of each eigenchannel there is a switcher which drives the channel output either to the conventional decoding circuit or to the rectification circuit . during each transmission",
    "an appropriate optimization problem is solved , which determines the usage of each antenna and a switching mechanism selects the appropriate circuits .    in this paper , we focus on the minimization of the transmitted power given that both information and energy constraints are satisfied .",
    "based on the notation considered , the proposed technique introduces the following optimization problem    [ eq : problemgeneral ] @xmath61    where @xmath62 indicates the maximum power that can be used in each eigenchannel , while binary variable @xmath63 indicates whether the @xmath34-th eigenchannel is used for information transfer ( @xmath64 ) or energy transfer ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "note that terms @xmath66 are equal to the more intuitive representation @xmath67 when @xmath68 , @xmath46 .",
    "this mathematical program involves binary and continuous variables , as well as nonlinear functions ; hence it belongs to the class of mixed - integer nonlinear optimization problems , which are very hard to solve in general .",
    "the incorporation of @xmath25 into makes the problem more realistic and general , with interesting implication effects . on the one hand",
    ", increasing @xmath25 reduces the achieved information rate in . on the other hand ,",
    "the added cross - eigenchannel interference becomes a useful source of energy transfer in , which implies that even zero - power eh eigenchannels can contribute to the satisfaction of the eh constraint . from an optimization point of view , the problem becomes more difficult to tackle due to the presence of term @xmath69 in the denominator of the logarithmic terms in .",
    "hence , the developed solution methodologies are quite general and can be applied not only for the solution of the special case with @xmath29 , but also for other problems with similar information rate expressions .",
    "we note that the energy harvested due to the receiver noise is negligible .",
    "in addition , the optimization problem can be solved at the source node and then control bits can be used in order to inform the receiver about the content of each eigenchannel .      the main challenge to implement the proposed swipt technique is to perform the required signal processing , including the eigenchannel decomposition , with ultra - low power consumption . this requires the use of analog passive electronic elements ( e.g. , schottky diode ) , which is in line with current implementations of conventional wireless power transfer @xcite . in respect to these requirements , analog eigenmode beamforming with passive electronic elements ( 180-degree hybrid couplers ) is a promising technology recently proposed @xcite , that could be used for the practical implementation of the proposed technique .",
    "this implementation technology achieves diagonalization of the mimo channel matrix without destroying the energy content of the received signal .",
    "it is worth noting that although digital beamforming dominates current communication systems , analog beamforming is an emerging technology with particular impact on future millimeter - wave ( mmwave)- based systems @xcite . in these systems , the transceivers are composed of a large number of antennas and the conventional baseband / digital processing requires a large number of analog - to - digital converters and rf chains , which results in a high complexity and power consumption .",
    "also note that swipt is only studied theoretically and not used in current devices ; proof - of - concept implementations are still under investigation .",
    "the considered problem is nonlinear and combinatorial in nature , and hence very hard to solve .",
    "moreover , standard milp / misocp solvers are not directly applicable for its solution due to the presence of nonlinear terms . in this section ,",
    "two formulations are proposed for the optimal / near - optimal solution of problem using standard solvers .",
    "the first , transforms the problem into an equivalent misocp formulation that provides the optimal solution , while the second approximates the logarithmic functions using piecewise linear approximation ( pla ) to arrive at a near - optimal ( in most cases optimal ) result by solving a series of milp problems .",
    "these approaches have exponential complexity and are only used for benchmarking purposes ; the reason for discussing both is that the misocp guarantees optimality , while the milp has more robust performance ( see section [ sec : nume ] ) .",
    "in addition , we provide a polynomial algorithm that optimally solves the problem for the special case of @xmath70 .      towards the optimal solution of ,",
    "we write it as :    [ eq : socp1 ] @xmath71    formulation is not misocp due to the products of variables , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath46 , in ( [ eq : socp1b])-([eq : socp1c ] ) and the general product of terms in ( [ eq : socp1b ] ) .",
    "next we show how these can be transformed into equivalent representations of misocp form .",
    "firstly , we state two auxiliary propositions .    [ prop : prod ] let @xmath74 and @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "constraint @xmath76 can be equivalently represented with the following linear constraints :    [ eq : prod ] @xmath77    the proof is easily derived by checking that @xmath78 and @xmath79 yield @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",

    "next , we will show that the general product appearing in ( [ eq : socp1b ] ) can be represented by a hierarchy of convex second - order rotated cone ( sorc ) constraints of the form @xmath90 using proposition [ prop : socpdecomp ] .",

    "let us define existing variables as @xmath92 and new variables @xmath93 .",
    "the gmc is equivalent to the following sorc constraints @xmath94    the proof is based on the fact that each of these constraints is sorc , hence convex , while if these constraints hold the gmc holds as well . to see why this is true ,",
    "let us consider the case @xmath95 .",
    "setting @xmath96 , this constraint becomes :    [ eq : examplegm ] @xmath97    the two constraints in yield that @xmath98 , which combined with gives @xmath99 ; hence , if - hold , the original constraint also holds .    to bring ( [ eq : socp1b ] ) into the gmc form , we define @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and rewrite it as : @xmath102 following proposition [ prop : socpdecomp ] , we can represent ( [ eq : socp1b ] ) with the hierarchy of sorc constraints by setting @xmath103 @xmath46 , @xmath104 @xmath105 and @xmath106 . towards this direction ,",
    "a total of @xmath107 new variables are needed , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 sorc constraints .",
    "based on the above analysis , the original problem can be rewritten as :    [ eq : socp2 ] @xmath110    in formulation , ( [ eq : socp2b])-([eq : socp2 g ] ) represent the information constraint , ( [ eq : socp2h ] ) the eh constraint , while ( [ eq : socp2j ] ) , ( [ eq : socp2k ] ) and ( [ eq : socp2l ] ) , ( [ eq : socp2 m ] ) are used to linearize equations @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "note that formulation is misocp and can be solved with standard optimization solvers .      in this section",
    "we propose an iterative approach for the solution of , where in each iteration a milp problem is solved .",
    "although , this approach yields near - optimal results ( in most cases optimal ) it is considerably faster than misocp for large problems . towards this direction ,",
    "we examine the implications of having a fixed value for the total power @xmath111 in .",
    "assuming that this value is equal to @xmath112 , the problem becomes :    [ eq : milp1 ] @xmath113    using the transformations , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , introduced in section [ sec : misocp ] via proposition 1 , all the constraints of problem become of milp form , except from constraint , due to the presence of terms @xmath114 .",
    "nonetheless , these terms can be transformed into milp form by considering appropriate piecewise linear approximation ( pla ) functions @xmath115 .",
    "pla functions @xmath116 can also be selected to provide either upper or lower bounds ( ub or lb ) to the optimal value of problem , if @xmath117 or @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath46 , respectively .",

    "one can easily find the pla of a logarithmic function , by considering a fixed number of points , at integer multiples of a parameter @xmath122 , such that segments are either tangent ( for ub ) or intersect ( for lb ) the logarithmic function .",
    "nonetheless , this approach has no control over the approximation error , while the maximum error for different segments varies . for this reason",
    ", an approach has been followed that produces segments when needed so that the approximation error does not exceed a predefined value @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "although this approach may lead to a large number of segments we can adjust @xmath123 to achieve the desirable number of segments and at the same time maintain the error less than a constant known value .",
    "the approximation procedure , involves two steps for the production of each segment .",
    "in lb - pla , where an lb envelope needs to be produced , the first step for the derivation of segment @xmath124 , starts from a known intersection point @xmath125 ( initially , @xmath126 ) and finds a line @xmath127 such that @xmath128 , for @xmath129 . in the second step ,",

    ", the first segment has the largest impact ; this implies that @xmath152 will be the first variable to be assigned a nonzero value and only if @xmath152 becomes equal to its maximum value , variable @xmath153 will be assigned a nonzero value .",
    "this ensures the assumption made that @xmath150 will be non - zero only if @xmath154 have attained their maximum value .",
    "based on the above discussion formulation becomes :    [ eq : milp2 ] @xmath155    note that formulation is milp , as constraints - , which represent constraint , also become linear under the considered pla scheme .",

    "due to this assignment , problem , with @xmath70 , can be written as :    [ eq : problemfa_infp ] @xmath179    three important remarks can be made regarding .    * remark 1 . * at most one eh eigenchannel can have nonzero power .",
    "remark 1 is true because there is no imposed upper bound on the transmitted power in each eigenchannel . as a result ,",

    "* eigenchannels with @xmath184 are those with the overall smallest eigenvalues .",
    "this is because `` better '' eigenchannels are beneficial for both the satisfaction of the information and eh constraints .",

    "* remark 3 .",
    "* at the optimal solution , no information eigenchannel should have zero power .    to see why this is true ,",
    "notice that eigenchannels with zero power can contribute to the eh constraint but not to the information constraint .",
    "this is a result of the cross eigenchannel interference , @xmath189 , that is present in all eigenchannels due to the channel estimation error .",

    "<S> in this paper , we theoretically investigate a new technique for simultaneous information and power transfer ( swipt ) in multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) point - to - point with radio frequency energy harvesting capabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed technique exploits the spatial decomposition of the mimo channel and uses the eigenchannels either to convey information or to transfer energy . in order to generalize our study </S>",
    "<S> , we consider channel estimation error in the decomposition process and the interference between the eigenchannels . </S>",
    "<S> an optimization problem that minimizes the total transmitted power subject to maximum power per eigenchannel , information and energy constraints is formulated as a mixed - integer nonlinear program and solved to optimality using mixed - integer second - order cone programming . </S>",
    "<S> a near - optimal mixed - integer linear programming solution is also developed with robust computational performance . </S>",
    "<S> a polynomial complexity algorithm is further proposed for the optimal solution of the problem when no maximum power per eigenchannel constraints are imposed . </S>",
