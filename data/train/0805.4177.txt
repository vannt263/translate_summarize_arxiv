    "many authors have studied the neutrino charge radius ( ncr ) @xcite . in 1972 ,",
    "bardeen , gastmans and lautrup @xcite showed in the frame of the sm and using the unitary gauge that the ncr is infinite and therefore it is not a physical quantity .",
    "later , in the same year , s.y .",
    "lee @xcite working in the unitary gauge considered the @xmath16 scattering and defined the ncr including besides the usual terms , diagrams in which the photon is replaced by a neutral gauge boson @xmath17 . in this way he obtained a finite , although gauge dependent quantity @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest analyses of the neutrino charge radius , in the context of the general one - loop electromagnetic form factor of a fermion in electroweak theories , was carried out in 1977 by lee and shrock @xcite .",
    "these authors working in the context of the sm and using the linear r@xmath18 gauge showed explicitly that the ncr is not only infinite , but also gauge dependent .",
    "lee and shrock showed in their paper how a full calculation , including not just charge - radius terms , but also box diagrams ( which could not be considered to be corrections to the neutrino electromagnetic vertex ) combined together to yield a gauge - independent total amplitude .",
    "hence , in order to look for a definition of a physical neutrino charge radius one has to consider other diagrams which contribute to the total amplitude of the physical process @xmath19 .",
    "the papers written by s.y .",
    "lee , and by b.w .",
    "lee and r.e .",
    "shrock inspired many works in which finite and gauge independent quantities , based on the ncr , were introduced by considering the @xmath16 scattering @xcite .",
    "we want to end this paragraph pointying out the following .",
    "eventhough that it has been already shown that the neutrino charge radius is an infinite and gauge dependent quantity in the frame of the standard model ( sm ) when just the proper diagrams are taken into account , it is possible to define a physical neutrino charge radius by considering the @xmath16 scattering , which becomes a finite and gauge independent quantity , independent of the lepton @xmath20 used to define it and also which only gets contribution from the proper neutrino electromagnetic vertex @xcite .",
    "discussions on the experimental bounds on the ncr can be found , for example , in refs.@xcite    on the other hand , it is well known that any fermion may develop an anapole moment @xmath21 @xcite . in particular , the neutrino , even massless , may have an anapole moment @xmath22 .",
    "measurements of the solar neutrino flux at super - kamiokande established that at least one neutrino is not massless @xcite . besides , from atmospheric and accelerator neutrino oscillations , we know that there is a non - vanishing mass difference @xcite . from solar and reactor neutrino oscillations , we know that there is a different non - vanishing mass difference @xcite .",
    "so , at least two neutrinos are not massless .",
    "the neutrino anapole moment ( nam ) has been discussed in great detail in the literature @xcite . here , we only want to remark that in the frame of the standard model @xcite it is satisfied the relation @xmath23 for a massless dirac neutrino @xcite .",
    "the relation between the charge form factor and the anapole form factor for massless active ( left - handed ) neutrinos is not model - dependent .",
    "in fact , it is a consequence of having an effective vertex for the neutrino with the left - handed chirality projector .    in this work ,",
    "we study possible new physics effects on the ncr in a model independent approach by using the effective lagrangian technique  @xcite , which is an appropriate scheme to study those processes that are suppressed or forbidden in the sm . motivated by the highly gauge dependent behavior of the charge and the anapole form factors , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , within the context of the sm ,",
    "we will focus on those effects that could be induced by a yang  mills sector possessing a richer gauge structure than that of the dimension  four theory . to this end",
    ", we will consider an effective electroweak yang ",
    "mills sector that includes @xmath2invariants of dimension higher than four . as we will see below ,",
    "there is only one dimension  six @xmath2 invariant that induces the @xmath3 vertex and contributes at the one  loop level to these form factors , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "hence , we can write @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the standard model form factors",
    ". we will show that , as a consequence of the @xmath2 symmetry , the dimension ",
    "six @xmath3 vertex gives a contribution which leads to manifest gauge independent expressions for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 form factors .",
    "this result arises , in part , due to the fact that the @xmath26 invariants of dimension higher than four are not affected by the gauge  fixing procedure used in the dimension  four theory . as a consequence , in the context of effective theories , fermionic form factors would be made of vertices that are not affected by the gauge  fixing procedure , which eventually would lead to gauge independent form factors  @xcite .",
    "even more , we will show that it is possible to express these form factors as finite functions of @xmath8 by renormalizing them in the sense of effective field theories  @xcite .",
    "these form factors get contribution at the one loop level only from the proper neutrino electromagnetic vertex .",
    "besides , for a massless neutrino and as a consequence of having an effective vertex for the neutrino with the left - handed chirality projector the relation @xmath27 is fulfilled .",
    "hence , @xmath28 and therefore we get the relation @xmath29 , as in the standard model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sm ] , the structure of the electromagnetic and anapole form factors of the neutrino in the context of the sm is briefly discussed , mainly to fix our notation . in sec.[cal ] , the calculation of the electromagnetic and anapole form factors of the neutrino in the context of an effective yang - mills electroweak theory is presented .",
    "the gauge independence of these form factors , as well as the possibility of introducing a renormalization scheme beyond the dyson s sense , will be emphasized . finally , in sec.[con ] the conclusions are presented .",
    "in this section , we will present a schematic discussion on the main features of the charge and anapole form factors of a massless dirac neutrino within the context of the sm @xcite .",
    "we will take advantage to introduce the notation and conventions that will be used through the paper . for a massless left - handed neutrino",
    "the matrix element of the electromagnetic current can be expressed in terms of only one form factor @xmath31 as @xmath32 for a massless neutrino , this expression can easily be rewritten as follows    @xmath33 f_a^{sm}(q^2 ) \\ } u_\\nu ( p)\\ ] ]    where@xcite @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the charge and anapole form factors of the neutrino , respectively .",
    "@xmath36 satisfies the physical requirement :    @xmath37    on the other hand , the ncr and the nam are defined , respectively , by    @xmath38    and    @xmath39    that is ,    @xmath40     proper diagrams contributing to the neutrino charge radius in the standard model in the linear @xmath41 gauge.,width=288 ]     reducible diagrams contributing to the neutrino charge radius in the standard model in the linear @xmath41 gauge.,width=288 ]",
    "we now turn to calculating the one  loop contribution of an anomalous ( nonrenormalizable ) @xmath3 vertex to the charge and anapole form factors of the sm dirac neutrino .",
    "next , we will predict the corresponding charge radius by adopting an appropriate renormalization scheme .",
    "the gauge structure of the @xmath3 vertex ( and also of @xmath42 ) has been the subject of important attention in the literature in diverse contexts .",
    "the one  loop radiative corrections to the renormalizable vertex have been calculated in the sm  @xcite and some of its extensions  @xcite .",
    "its most general structure has been parametrized in a model independent manner using the effective lagrangian approach  @xcite and used in countless phenomenological applications  @xcite .",
    "one effective electroweak lagrangian can be constructed by adding to the dimension four lagrangian all the @xmath26 invariants of dimension higher than four , which may respect or no discrete transformations , such as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 or some combinations of them .",
    "the effective lagrangian can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents the sm lagrangian and @xmath48 are @xmath49 invariants of dimension higher than four .",
    "@xmath50 represents the new physics scale and the @xmath51 are unknown coefficients , which can be calculated once the fundamental theory is known .",
    "the @xmath26 structure of some of the @xmath52 operators depend on the mechanism responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "if this breaking occurs through the higgs mechanism , the @xmath26 symmetry is linearly realized through the higgs doublet . if this is not the case , the electroweak symmetry",
    "is realized nonlinearly through the introduction of the matrix field @xmath53 instead of the higgs doublet . here ,",
    "the @xmath54 fields represent the pseudo goldstone bosons and @xmath55 is the fermi scale . in this case , the effective lagrangian parametrizes new physics that are the responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite . in this paper , we will focus on those type of effective interactions that are independent of the mechanism responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking . as we will see below ,",
    "this class of invariants induce the nonrenormalizable structure of the @xmath3 vertex , which is dictated exclusively by the @xmath2 group .    from the known particles , the @xmath56 gauge boson , whose properties",
    "would exhaustively be studied at the next generation of linear colliders , is the one which possesses the richer collection of electromagnetic form factors , as it is charged and has the highest spin within the category of renormalizable theories . to our best knowledge ,",
    "gaemers and gounaris @xcite derived initially 9 form factors for the @xmath3 vertex , but further on a careful analysis carried out by hagiwara ",
    "peccei  zeppenfeld ",
    "hikasa @xcite showed that only 7 of these quantities are independent indeed .",
    "subsequent studies have confirmed these results @xcite .",
    "these form factors define the charge , the magnetic and electric dipole moments , the magnetic and electric quadrupole moments , and the cp  even and cp  odd anapole moments of this particle .",
    "the @xmath3 vertex is given by the following lagrangian : @xmath57,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , etc . while the cp  even @xmath60 parameters define the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments , the cp ",
    "odd ones @xmath61 determine the electric dipole and magnetic quadrupole moments of the @xmath56 gauge boson  @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "represent the cp  even and cp  odd anapole moments of this particle .",
    "the only terms in the above equation which are explicitly invariant under the electromagnetic @xmath64 gauge group are those associated with the form factors @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , the above interactions arise from a more fundamental lagrangian which is invariant under the electroweak @xmath26 gauge group . in the linear realization of the group @xcite , the electroweak effective lagrangian that induces @xmath67",
    "can be written in terms of @xmath68 invariants that comprise interactions of up to dimension eight as follows : @xmath69 where the dimension  four yang  mills term has been included . here",
    ", @xmath70 is the covariant derivative of the @xmath26 group and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 are the respective field tensors . in addition , @xmath74 is the higgs doublet .",
    "the two dimension  eight operators were introduced in order to generate the anapole moments of the @xmath56 boson .",
    "they are made of the @xmath26invariant piece @xmath75 @xcite needed to generate the @xmath56 current .",
    "these operators , which have not been considered in the literature , can be eliminated using the equations of motion , as must be . as for the dimension ",
    "six invariants , their properties have widely been studied in the literature in diverse contexts @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned in sec.[sm ] , a massless dirac neutrino possess only two electromagnetic form factors , which are however not independent .",
    "these form factors are the charge , @xmath0 , and the anapole , @xmath1 , which satisfy the relation @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath3 vertex can contribute at the one  loop level to these form factors through the cp  conserving structures .",
    "however , in this work we will focus on the contribution given by the cp  even @xmath77 component of this vertex , which is governed exclusively by the @xmath2 gauge group . a comprehensive analysis for the off ",
    "shell vertex @xmath78 , with @xmath79 an arbitrary fermion and @xmath80 , will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "there are several good reasons to consider the contribution given by the @xmath2invariant @xmath81 to the neutrino form factors . in first place",
    "is its pure yang ",
    "mills nature , which leads to the most general structure for the gauge @xmath3 vertex .",
    "this invariant constitutes therefore a good theoretical instrument to studying the gauge structure of electromagnetic form factors of elementary particles .",
    "another important reason to use this operator is , as we will see below , that it leads to a ncr and nam that are gauge independent in manifest way .",
    "also , due its nonrenormalizable nature , @xmath82 is necessarily generated at one  loop or higher orders in any renormalizable theory , which means that it maybe sensitive to new physics effects .    using the notation given in fig.[v ]",
    ", the vertex function , @xmath83 , for the @xmath84 interaction can be written as : @xmath85 which , as it is evident , satisfies the following simple ward identities : @xmath86    we now turn to calculating the contribution of the above vertex to the nam .",
    "since the @xmath82 operator is not affected by the gauge  fixing procedure of the dimension  four theory , there are no contributions from ghost fields .",
    "also , there are not contributions from goldstone bosons , as @xmath82 does not depend on the mechanism responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking . accordingly , @xmath82 only can contribute through the proper diagram of fig.[i]@xmath87 and the self ",
    "energy diagrams given in figs.[r]@xmath88 and [ r]@xmath89 .",
    "the latter one being induced by @xmath82 through the quartic @xmath90 vertex . from all the involved vertices ,",
    "only the sm @xmath3 one , which contributes through the diagram in fig.[r]@xmath88 , depends on the gauge  fixing procedure .",
    "however , we have verified that due to the above ward identities , this diagram gives a vanishing contribution .",
    "also , we have encountered that there is no contribution from diagram in fig .",
    "[ r]@xmath89 .",
    "so , the contribution to the nam arises only through the proper diagram given in fig.[i]@xmath87 , whose vertices are all independent of the gauge  fixing procedure .",
    "this means that the only gauge dependence of the nam could arise through the @xmath56 propagator , which in the @xmath41 gauge is given by @xmath91.\\ ] ] however , it is clear that due to the ward identities given above , the longitudinal components of the @xmath56 propagators do not contribute to the proper diagram given in fig.[i]@xmath87 . as a consequence ,",
    "the amplitude for this diagram is manifestly gauge independent .",
    "this amplitude is given by @xmath92[(k - p)^2-m^2_w][(k - p')^2-m^2_w]},\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the mass of the charge lepton to which is associated the neutrino in consideration . using the passarino ",

    "it is clear that the @xmath100 condition is fulfilled .",
    "it is also evident that , although gauge independent , the anapole form factor is divergent . in the next subsection",
    ", the possibility of renormalizing this quantity within the context of effective field theories will be explored .",
    "the anapole form factor can be expressed in terms of elementary functions as follows : @xmath101,\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the dimensional regularization scale and the ultraviolet divergence is contained in : @xmath103 with @xmath104 the euler s constant .",

    "the invariant needed to absorb the divergence is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the usual lepton doublet and @xmath110 is the gauge tensor associated with the @xmath111 group . in this way , the divergence can be absorbed by the @xmath112 parameter of the effective lagrangian . here , we want to point out the following .",

    "we need to assume some value for the @xmath77 parameter and the new physics scale @xmath50 . we will use the most recent experimental limit on @xmath77 obtained by the d0 collaboration  @xcite , namely , @xmath121 for @xmath122 tev .",
    "more recently , this collaboration limited the trilinear @xmath42 vertex to @xmath123 at the @xmath124 c.l . and for the same value of @xmath50  @xcite .",

    "using these values , we obtain the following additional contribution to the neutrino charge radius : @xmath127    it is interesting to compare our result with the theoretical one obtained , within the frame of the sm and by using the pinch technique  @xcite , in ref.@xcite . in this reference",

    "we showed that this vertex function is independent of the gauge  fixing parameter and ultraviolet finite , as it can be renormalized within the framework of the effective theory .",

    "this relation is a consequence of having an effective vertex for the neutrino with the left - handed chirality projector .",
    "an interesting point , long discussed in the literature , is the gauge independence and non - divergence of the neutrino charge radius . in the sm , this issue is now clarified with a definition of this quantity with all the required properties , which is furthermore gauge independent and finite . in the model discussed by the present paper , one should again treat these points with care , particularly in the context of effective theories .",
