    "stars are formed in molecular clouds which contain most of the mass but occupy only a tiny portion of the volume of the galactic disk .",
    "their dispersal into the general star field was historically attributed to relatively slow processes : the evaporation of open clusters , and gravitational scattering processes that produce the observed correlation between stellar age and galactic scale height . early studies of the kinematics of pre - ms stars reported radial velocities within 1kms@xmath3 of their natal clouds , with a few exceptions like fk ser ( herbig 1973 ) , so there was little evidence for early dispersal .",
    "but there was a puzzle : for many years , stars in the intermediate stage of stellar evolution between the classical t tauri stars and the zero - age main sequence could not be found near molecular clouds ( herbig 1978 ) .",
    "they obviously must exist in considerable numbers , just as there must be an order of magnitude more children of ages @xmath4 yr old than there are infants with ages @xmath5 yr in any steady - state human population .",
    "a significant portion of this missing population of intermediate - aged pre - ms stars was finally found among the @xmath210@xmath6 sources of the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) . unlike infrared excesses or prominent optical emission lines , x - ray emission is elevated @xmath7 above main sequence levels for the entire duration of the pre - ms phases , and thus provides an excellent criterion to distinguish older pre - ms stars from the general galactic star population ( feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) . in an important series of papers , _ rosat _ scientists spectroscopically identified dozens of lithium- rich , magnetically active weak - lined t tauri stars ( neuhuser 1997 , and references therein ) . unlike traditional t tauri samples that were spatially concentrated around molecular clouds , the young rass stars typically lie several to tens of parsecs from any active star forming region . for our discussions , recall that 1 kms@xmath3 translates into 1.0pcmyr@xmath3 .",
    "nearly 10@xmath8 rass sources are associated with stars in the tycho astrometric catalog ( @xmath9 @xmath10 11 ) , and many are concentrated along the gould belt of molecular clouds and ob associations ( guillout et al .",
    "1998 ) . when x - ray flux limits and the full extent of the gould belt are taken into account ,",
    "the rass sources represent a population of tens of thousands of young stars .",
    "clearly many of the missing older pre - ms stars have now been located .",
    "this discovery of so many widely dispersed x - ray - emitting pre - ms stars requires that much of the stellar dispersal from active star - forming regions occurs on timescales of @xmath11 yr .",
    "several ideas have emerged to explain this phenomenon .",
    "1 .   stars may undergo gravitational scattering during their protostellar or t tauri phases resulting in the ejection of some stars at high velocities ( sterzik & durisen 1995 ; reipurth 2000 ; sterzik , this volume ) .",
    "this process preferentially occurs in triple systems where a hard binary ejects the third member .",
    "this process has specific predictions .",
    "the run - away pre - ms stars should : a ) be single and not in multiple systems ; b ) have a mass function biased towards low masses , with many brown dwarfs ; and c ) have space motions that point radially from known modern star - forming regions .",
    "there is little evidence that the dispersed rass young stars have these properties .",
    "as the dynamical arguments are convincing , it seems likely that dynamically ejected stars will be found with the deeper astrometric surveys such as _ fame _",
    "( greene , this volume ) and _ gaia_. 2 .   rather than ejecting stars from molecular clouds",
    ", pre - ms stars may appear isolated because their molecular clouds disappear shortly after star formation occurs ( e.g. palla & galli 1997 ) .",
    "there is evidence that star formation occurs over a short timescale within a given molecular cloud ( elmegreen 2001 ) and , if the cloud is quickly dispersed by stellar radiation and outflows , the resulting pre - ms stars would appear dispersed among older galactic populations .",
    "this model predicts frequent formation and dissolution of molecular clouds and near - coevality of the stellar populations produced ( @xmath10_few _ myr ) .",
    "pre - ms stars may be widely dispersed because they inherit the motions of their natal molecular gas , which exhibits supersonic motions on large scales in gmcs ( feigelson 1996 ) .",
    "groups of stars from different parts of a gmc will inherit motions from cloud turbulence and will be dispersed over tens of parsecs during their pre - ms evolution .",
    "this model is supported by a wealth of observational evidence for velocity dispersions of order @xmath12 kms@xmath3 on scales of @xmath13pc in molecular cloud complexes .",
    "for example , co maps of the ophiuchus clouds , with @xmath14 m@xmath15 and @xmath16 m@xmath17 of young stars , and orion clouds , with @xmath18 m@xmath15 and @xmath19 m@xmath20 show radial velocity gradients of @xmath21 km s@xmath3 ( e.g. de geus et al .",
    "1990 ; tatematsu et al .  1993 ; miesch et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the larger clouds ,",
    "these high - velocity motions are shared by the massive cores where rich star clusters form , as well as smaller cores and cloudlets .",
    "truly giant cloud complexes , like w51 with @xmath22 m@xmath15 and @xmath14 m@xmath20 , show velocity dispersions around 20 km s@xmath3 on scales of 100pc ( carpenter & sanders 1998 ) .",
    "such high velocities are ubiquitous in molecular cloud complexes , and are summarized by the relationship @xmath23 @xmath24 5 kms@xmath3(r/50pc)@xmath25 ( larson 1981 ; efremov & elmegreen 1998 ) .",
    "this relation and other fractal properties of molecular clouds are commonly interpreted as manifestations of supersonic mhd turbulence ( vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "2000 ) .    given the evidence for supersonic gas motions , it is difficult to imagine that many pre - ms stars born in a gmc complex would _ not _ be endowed with 510 kms@xmath3 velocities upon birth ( feigelson 1996 ) .",
    "members of a cluster produced by a massive molecular core with a small velocity dispersion will appear as an easily - found rich star association .",
    "but it will be surrounded by an inhomogeneous halo of sparser star clusters produced in smaller molecular cores . after 10 myr , the dispersed star complex",
    "may be spread over @xmath2100pc with space motions convergent to a 2050pc region representing the parental molecular cloud .",
    "the sco - cen ob association provides a unique laboratory for evaluating the dispersal of young stars .",
    "sco - cen ( sco ob2 ) is the nearest region of recent and on - going high - mass star - formation to the sun ( see review by blauuw 1991 ) , and its projected boundaries encompass @xmath25% of the sky ( de zeeuw et al 1999 ; dz99 ) .",
    "sco - cen consists of 3 ob subgroups : upper sco ( us ; 56 myr ; 145pc ) , upper centaurus lupus ( ucl ; 1415 myr ; 142pc ) , lower centaurus crux ( lcc ; 1112 myr ; 118pc ; de geus et al .",
    "1989 ; dg89 ) . de geus ( 1992 ; dg92 ) summarized the studies of the early - type stellar populations of sco - cen as well as their effects on the local interstellar medium ( winds & supernovae ; later discussed in  4 ) .",
    "in our recent study ( mlf00 ) , we present an argument connecting the origins of three dispersed pre - ms stellar groups to sco - cen : the compact @xmath0 cha cluster ( @xmath26 = 97pc , age @xmath24 8 myr ; mamajek , lawson , & feigelson , 1999 , lawson , this volume ) ; the extended tw hydra association ( twa , @xmath26 @xmath24 55pc , age @xmath24 10 myr , see webb , this volume ) ; and a small group of stars near @xmath27 cha ( @xmath26 @xmath24 110pc , age @xmath28 515 myr ; mlf00 ) . their space motions are moving nearly radially away from the two oldest sco - cen ob subgroups and their ages are consistent with the times of minimum separation from the subgroups .",
    "we suggest that @xmath0 cha , @xmath27 cha and the twa are only part of a dispersed population of sco - cen outliers formed in / near the sco - cen gmc 515 myr ago .",
    "some of these outliers should lie , by chance , quite near the sun and thus constitute excellent targets for the study of pre - ms stellar and disk evolution .",
    "to pursue this idea , we compiled from the literature a heterogenous list of other young dispersed li - rich dwarfs , herbig ae / be stars , and disked early - type stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "our primary astrometric data sources are the _ hipparcos _ ( esa 1997 ) and tycho-2 catalogs ( hog et al .",
    "2000 ) , and we take radial velocities ( @xmath29 ) from the compilations of barbier - brossat et al .",
    "( 2000 ) or maloroda et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , unless otherwise noted .",
    "we calculate and compare the motions of these stars to sco - cen as described in mlf00 , assuming constant linear motion over the past @xmath215 myr ( i.e. over the known star - formation history of sco - cen ) .",
    "we considered an outlier candidate to be a star which was within @xmath250 pc of a sco - cen subgroup within the past 15 myr .",
    "we omit the galactic potential , since this interval is much smaller than the epicyclic ( @xmath30 ) and vertical ( @xmath31 ) periods .",
    "we claim this is satisfactory for this initial effort .",
    "the dangers in extrapolating stellar motions back in time are nicely summarized by soderblom et al .",

    "the superbubble provides a natural mass and momentum source for forming the cra molecular clouds and its associated stars .",
    "the question `` why are nearly all of the very young , nearby stars located in the southern , rather than northern , sky ? '' may have a simple answer : `` because of the sco - cen association '' .",
    "the sco - cen association likely has a total population of @xmath210@xmath59 stars ( dg92 ) , similar to the better - studied orion complex . as in orion ,",
    "several rich associations have formed in sco - cen over a @xmath215 myr period , producing the us - ucl - lcc subgroups , as well as many smaller , peripheral molecular clouds and dispersed clusters . these small , unbound stellar groups formed in either the progenitor sco - cen gmc , or in short - lived molecular clouds formed by the superbubbles .",
    "these groups are partly or fully evaporated today and are now seen as dispersed collections of pre - ms stars that we label as the tw hya association , @xmath0 cha cluster , @xmath1 pic group , etc .",
    "such stellar dispersal over 10s-100pc over @xmath210 myr is expected if the stars inherited their space motions from clouds which were endowed momentum either from ( 1 ) supersonic turbulence in gmcs or ( 2 ) formation in molecular clouds associated with expanding superbubbles .",
    "we believe that this scenario provides a convincing explanation for the presense of many ( or most ) of the isolated , extremely young ( @xmath210 myr - old ) stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "it is supported by the approximate agreement between the kinematic and nuclear ages .",
    "observationally , we see the `` process '' continue today in the `` 150pc '' molecular clouds in the vicinity of the sco - cen ob subgroup .",
    "the key to testing these ideas is higher quality astrometric data : more precise parallaxes , proper motions , and radial velocities for all nearby pre - ms stars . except for radial velocities which can be obtained from ground - based telescopes , missions like _ fame",
    "_ , _ diva _ and _ gaia _ are critical to this effort .",
