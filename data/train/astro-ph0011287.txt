    "recent investigations on mhd turbulence have confirmed the existence of a mechanism able to extract angular momentum from weakly magnetized accretion discs ( balbus & hawley , 1991 ; fleming , stone & hawley , 2000 ; miller & stone , 2000 ) .",
    "many aspects of accretion are , however , still not understood . in the meanwhile",
    ", present disc models mostly incorporate the @xmath0-prescription ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ) and are of increasing complexity .",
    "for instance , models of steady state , keplerian , vertically stratified @xmath0-discs ( e.g. cannizzo , 1992 ; hameury et al . , 1998 ; dalessio et al . , 1999",
    ") should definitely supplant the more widespread , vertically averaged version ( pringle , 1981 ) which , despite a great simplicity and flexibility , can not account for fine physical effects , remains in essence somewhat limited and contains some artefacts , like degenerate solutions ( collin - souffrin & dumont , 1990 ) .",
    "vertically explicit disc models offer in principle a much better reliability but , due to the uncertainty on the @xmath0-formalism , they require an extra prescription specifying the depth - dependence of the viscous energy release ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister , 1982 ; mineshige & osaki , 1983 ; cannizzo & cameron , 1988 ; hameury et al . , 1998 ) . from a numerical point of view ,",
    "the bi - dimensional problem which involves partial / ordinary differential equations is much less trivial to solve than the vertically averaged problem , also meaning a much larger computational time ( by a factor @xmath4 say , corresponding to the typical resolution in the @xmath5-direction ) .",
    "it is therefore legitimate to ask , from a _ quantitative point of view _ at least , which benefits the vertically explicit model really brings .",
    "the aim of this report is to show how , for steady keplerian @xmath0-discs , the one layer approach and the vertically explicit approach compare .",
    "the main motivation is both to seek where the differences appear in an @xmath0-disc and to quantify these as functions of the accretion rate and value of the viscosity parameter",
    ". this investigation concerns three generic systems containing a disc : an active galactic nucleus , a young stellar object and a dwarf nova .",
    "we compare the structure of steady state keplerian accretion discs computed from the vertically averaged model ( hereafter , the va - model ) and from the vertically explicit model ( hereafter , the ve - model ) .",
    "the difference between the two resides therefore in the resolution of the vertical stratification .",
    "this analysis is carried out in the framework of the @xmath0-theory ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ) , with a uniform @xmath0-parameter value . for a detailed description of the models ,",
    "the reader is referred to hur ( 1998 , 2000 ) .    in order to give a meaning to the comparison ,",
    "the two models are made as close as possible and reduced to their simplest form . in particular",
    ", we use the same rosseland and planck opacity grids and equation of state corresponding to a solar mix at lte for both models .",
    "convective transport is not taken into account in the ve - model , for several reasons .",
    "first , it can not be included in the one layer version .",
    "second , it plays a role in regions of high opacity , namely where hydrogen recombines . in the framework of the mixing length theory ( e.g. cox & giuli , 1968 ) ,",
    "the disc region mainly involved has a small size and convection does not drastically change the disc structure ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister , 1982 ; cannizzo , 1993 ) .",
    "note that the weak effect of convection is sustained in the work by gu , vishniac & cannizzo ( 1999 ) .",
    "third , as explained below , we shall not analyze the region where the one layer has multiple solutions and which precisely encompasses the convectively unstable zone .",
    "also left aside is external irradiation .",
    "it depends on many parameters and has little effect on the global quantities ( midplane temperature , surface density , etc . )",
    "as long as the disc remains optically thick . regarding the depth - dependent viscosity prescription",
    ", we adopt the most common parameterization of the heat flux gradient , namely @xmath6    where @xmath7 is here the _ total pressure _ and @xmath8 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "we also neglect the disc self - gravity .",
    "the disc structure depends mainly on three input parameters : the central mass @xmath9 , the accretion rate @xmath10 and value of the @xmath0-viscosity parameter .",
    "the departures between the va - model and the ve - model are measured _ at the same radius _ @xmath11 by the ratio @xmath12    where @xmath13 is one of the following quantities : the temperature @xmath14 ( the subscript `` mid '' refers to the midplane ) , half the disc thickness @xmath15 ( taken as the altitude of the photosphere s base in the ve - model and as the pressure scale height in the va - model ) , the density @xmath16 , the total surface density @xmath17 and the optical thickness @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath19 is a function of the radius .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ courbe ] displays @xmath20 and @xmath21 obtained from the two models for parameter values @xmath22 typical of a dwarf nova ( dn ) disc , a young stellar object ( yso ) disc and a disc in an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "we see that the ve - model always gives a slightly thicker and hotter disc than the va - model , but the agreement is globally rather good .",
    "the other quantities , not shown here , compare very well too .    in order to test the sensitivity of these results to the values of the input parameter values , we have performed a series of computations by varying the accretion rate and the value of @xmath0 , for any of the above three systems .",
    "this amounts to about @xmath23 runs in total . since the one layer model yields a multivalued solution ( mvs ) , not present in the ve - model ( cannizzo , 1992 ) , the comparison has been restricted to the hot , inner and cold , outer branches located on both sides ( see fig . [ courbe ] ) .",
    "the approximate location of the mvs region will be specified later .     &",

    "so , we find @xmath51 over the radial domain and for accretion rates indicated in table [ tab : doc ] .",
    "we have repeated this procedure for the other four key quantities @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and for @xmath54 as well . table [ tab : agn1 ] summarizes the results .",
    "we notice that the agreement between the two approaches is excellent , indeed .",
    "the midplane temperature is slightly underestimated with the va - model , by a factor never exceeding @xmath55 ( in the cold outer disc ) for any @xmath0 , which is remarkable given the crudeness of this model .",
    "the other quantities are a little bit more affected by the vertical averaging : we have a mean factor @xmath56 on the central density and @xmath57 on the optical thickness and surface density .",
    "the largest departures are observed on the disc thickness , with a factor reaching @xmath58 in the cold , outer disc .",
    "the sensitivity to the value of the @xmath0-viscosity parameter is weak , even null for the temperature .",
    "however , the trend is that the deviations seem smaller with a smaller value of the @xmath0-parameter , except for @xmath15 .     & * hot , inner branch & * cold , outer branch + @xmath24 & @xmath59 & @xmath42 + @xmath27 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 + @xmath30 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 + @xmath33 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 + @xmath36 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 +   + & * hot , inner branch & * cold , outer branch + @xmath24 & @xmath59 & @xmath25 + @xmath27 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 + @xmath30 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 + @xmath33 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 + @xmath36 & @xmath74 & @xmath75 + * * * *     & * hot , inner branch & * cold , outer branch + @xmath24 & @xmath76 & @xmath77 + @xmath27 & @xmath78 & @xmath79 + @xmath30 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 + @xmath33 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 + @xmath36 & @xmath84 & @xmath85 +   + & * hot , inner branch & * cold , outer branch + @xmath24 & @xmath76 & @xmath76 + @xmath27 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 + @xmath30 & @xmath88 & @xmath44 + @xmath33 & @xmath89 & @xmath90 + @xmath36 & @xmath73 & @xmath91 + * * * *    we have carried out similar computations in the yso and dn cases .",
    "the domains of calculation , specific to each system ( gullbring et al .",
    ", 1998 ; horne , 1998 ) , are listed in table [ tab : doc ] and the results are summarized in tables [ tab : yso ] and [ tab : cv ] respectively . globally , the conclusions drawn in the agn case still hold .",
    "the best agreement between the two models is observed in the dn case . in particular ,",
    "the temperature ratio is constant ( @xmath92 ) throughout , whatever the value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , for @xmath50 and for the lowest accretion rates examined , the optical thickness becomes close to unity in the outer disc and so the optically thick approximation underlying the two models becomes doubtful .",
    "this produces a specially large ratio @xmath93 .",
    "we point out that the deviations between the two models are largest in the vicinity of the mvs region , on the hot branch side ( see fig .",
    "[ courbe ] ) .",
    "since our radial resolution ( set to @xmath94 in the present calculations ) is finite , it is expected that the `` real '' , maximum deviations ( i.e. the deviations resulting from an infinite resolution ) are probably slightly different to those reported in the tables .",
    "gathering the results obtained for the three systems considered here , we find that the mvs region which more or less encompasses the thermally unstable regime where hydrogen recombines ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister , 1982 ) is located at @xmath95    where the mass @xmath96 and accretion rate @xmath97 are expressed in m@xmath49 and m@xmath49/yr respectively",
    ". the universal character of this expression can easily be understood from power law solutions of the va - model ( hur , 1998 ) , given that the mvs region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : htrmap ] ) is roughly bounded by isotherms .",
    "given the ranges of parameter values ( masses , accretion rates and viscosity parameter values ) considered in this study , we can conclude that the vertically averaged model of steady state keplerian @xmath0-discs is remarkably reliable , since it provides solutions very close to those obtained from the vertically explicit version .",
    "the midplane temperature appears as the quantity least sensitive to the vertical averaging ( with a @xmath98 deviation only ) whereas the disc thickness seems the most affected ( a factor @xmath99 in some cases ) .",
    "problems dealing with the disc irradiation ( even with a global energy budget ) should therefore account for vertical stratification since the disc response is sensitive to the local flaring angle and radial gradient ( kenyon & hartmann , 1987 ) .",
    "this investigation demonstrates that the vertically averaged approach should be sufficient for many applications ( e.g. pringle , 1997 ; burderi , king & szuszkiewicz , 1998 ; collin & hur , 1999 ) , in particular if the level of accuracy required on the disc structure is low or moderate .",
    "note however that the tables given here can be used to `` correct '' the vertically averaged solution if a better precision is necessary .",
    "more basically , these tables show the typical error on the knowledge of the disc structure , that is , some methodology effect .",
    "it is interesting , but comforting , to see that the model is much more sensitive to the physics it contains ( like turbulent viscosity , convection , opacities , etc . )",
    "than to the method used to derive the disc structure .",
