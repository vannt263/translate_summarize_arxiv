    ".        the agb phase is the last phase of stellar evolution in intermediate to low mass stars ( @xmath3 ) in which significant nuclear burning takes place . during this phase stars",

    "the material around the star is observed to be dust rich ( @xcite ) .",
    "this phase is notoriously difficult to model owing to the difficulty in modeling ( in 1d ) stellar mass loss , convection , and mixing processes in the stellar interior .",
    "agb stars are very luminous and can contribute many tens of percent to the integrated light of stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the helium - shell flashes that occur during the agb phase trigger the third dredge - up ( tdu ) process that brings material from the interior of the star to the surface .",
    "the surfaces of agb stars begin as oxygen - rich ( c / o @xmath5 ) as a result of the primordial material from which the star forms , but the dredge - up process brings up carbon to the surface and in certain situations results in a carbon - rich envelope ( c / o @xmath6 ) .",
    "the creation of carbon stars depends sensitively on the various physical processes shaping the evolution of agb stars .    despite these uncertainties ,",
    "significant progress has been made in modeling agb stars and their dust envelopes and incorporating those models in sps models .",

    "comparison of these predictions to observed total fluxes revealed good agreement in the fuv@xmath98nir , but an offset was seen at @xmath139 .",
    "we repeated this test with our updated models and found that the offset is reduced from 0.33 dex to 0.13 dex when circumstellar dust is included .",
    "we also compared the models to the observed @xmath79 flux and found that the offset without circumstellar dust , which is greater than a factor of 30 , is only slightly reduced when circumstellar dust is included .",
    "it is likely that low levels of diffuse dust in these systems is providing the bulk of the observed @xmath79 emission .",
    "there has been much discussion in the literature regarding the sources responsible for the mid - ir emission in typical star - forming galaxies .",
    "possibilities include dust heated by young stellar populations , dust heated by old stellar populations , and circumstellar dust around agb stars .",
    "@xcite suggested that the latter could play a large role in the mid - ir emission of star - forming galaxies .",
    "this possibility is not borne out in our models .",
    "instead , circumstellar dust provides a rather small contribution to the mid - ir flux for galaxies with typical amounts of diffuse dust ( @xmath140 ) . this result does not preclude the possibility that evolved stars , including agb stars , contribute substantially to the heating of the diffuse dust",
    "indeed , @xcite argued for this based on observations of star - forming galaxies at @xmath127 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the launch of jwst will turn the spotlight on the @xmath141 seds of stellar populations across time . in this wavelength interval a variety of distinct physical processes contribute to the light , including pah emission and circumstellar dust .",
    "models such as the one presented in this paper will be necessary to interpret this data .",
    "in addition , jwst will provide stringent tests of these models by observing nearby agb stars in detail and entire populations of such stars in nearby galaxies . in the process",
    "we hope to learn not only about the evolutionary history of galaxies but also about the physics shaping the final stages in the lives of agb stars .",
    "we now summarize our main results .    * in agreement with previous work , our models indicate that the dusty circumstellar shells around agb stars can have a factor of @xmath142 effect on the integrated flux of star clusters and galaxies at @xmath143 .",
    "the effect is especially large at intermediate ages @xmath144 gyr and when the presence of diffuse dust is minimal .",
    "the emission associated with circumstellar dust shells may be important for interpreting the seds of quiescent galaxies at high redshift , where the average stellar age is relatively young . *",
    "the presence of diffuse dust in a galaxy sharply reduces the influence of circumstellar dust emission at @xmath93 . at @xmath79 ,",
    "circumstellar dust contributes only @xmath142% of the flux for star - forming galaxies with @xmath145 . at shorter wavelengths ( i.e.,@xmath146 ) , where under normal conditions diffuse dust does not contribute substantially",
    ", circumstellar dust may still play an important role . * in early - type galaxies lacking signatures of cold diffuse dust , the mid - ir data is far in excess of a blackbody extrapolation at shorter wavelengths .",
    "models that include circumstellar dust shells accurately reproduce the mid - ir photometry and spectra of early - type galaxies .",
    "the model mir flux is sensitive to age , even at old ages .",
    "this suggests that this wavelength range can be a useful age diagnostic once circumstellar dust models have been accurately calibrated .",
    "the @xmath26 silicate feature is qualitatively well matched but there are some quantitative differences at the @xmath147 level .",
    "we would like to thank martha boyer , martin groenewegen , dan kelson , ivo labbe , sundar srinivasan , benjamin sargent , and roberto rampazzo for generously sharing their data , and paul martini , dan kelson , and julianne dalcanton for fruitful conversations on this topic .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for their thoughtful comments that improved the quality of this manuscript .",
