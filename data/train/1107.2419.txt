    "the dynamo mechanism that generates large - scale magnetic fields in astrophysical objects is a topic of active research .",
    "almost all astrophysical bodies , e.g. , the galaxy , or the sun , show presence of large - scale shear ( differential rotation ) .",
    "it is now well established that this shear is an essential ingredient in the dynamo mechanism .",
    "this view is also supported by direct numerical simulations ( dns ) .",
    "in particular , dns of convective flows have been able to generate large - scale dynamos predominantly in the presence of shear @xcite , while non - shearing large - scale dynamos are only possible at very high rotation rates @xcite .",
    "the other vital constituent of the large - scale dynamo mechanism is helicity of the flow which is often described by the @xmath0 effect .",
    "indeed most dynamos , including the early model by @xcite , are the result of an @xmath0 effect combined with shear .",
    "of these two ingredients , shear is typically constant over the time scale of generation of the dynamo . for the case of the solar dynamo , shear or differential rotation",
    "are constrained by helioseismology . by contrast , measuring the @xmath0 effect is a non - trivial exercise .",
    "whenever it has been obtained from dns studies , it was found to have large fluctuations in space and time ; see e.g. , @xcite for the pdf of different components of the @xmath0 tensor and @xcite for the fluctuating time series of the total electromotive force , which is however different from the @xmath0 effect .",
    "what effect do these fluctuations have on the properties of the @xmath0shear dynamo ?",
    "in particular , can a fluctuating @xmath0 effect about a _",
    "zero _ mean drive a large - scale dynamo in conjunction with shear ?",
    "recent dns studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred to as brrk ) suggest that the answer to this question is yes .",
    "@xcite have further provided compelling evidence that the growth rate of the large - scale magnetic energy in such dynamos scales linearly with the shear rate , and the wavenumber of the fastest growing mode scales as the square root of the shear rate .",
    "it has been proposed that such a dynamo can also emerge by an alternate mechanism ( which has nothing to do with fluctuations of the @xmath0 effect ) involving the interaction between shear and mean current density .",
    "this mechanism is called the _ shear  current _",
    ". however recent dns studies of brrk as well as those of @xcite have not found evidence in support of it , and analytical works @xcite , for small magnetic reynolds number , have doubted its existence .",
    "furthermore , the shear ",
    "current effect does not produce the observed scaling , namely , growth - rate scales with the shear rate squared , and the wavenumber of the fastest growing mode scales linearly with the shear rate ; see section  4.2 of brrk .",
    "it behooves us then to consider the interaction between fluctuating @xmath0 effect and shear as a possible dynamo mechanism .",
    "@xcite was first to propose that fluctuations of kinetic helicity can give rise to negative turbulent diffusivities , thereby giving rise to a dynamo that is effective only in small scales @xcite .",
    "however , more relevant in the present context is the work of @xcite , who have investigated ( using numerical tools ) an one - dimensional model and ( with analytical techniques ) a simple mean - field model in a one - mode truncation with shear and fluctuating @xmath0 effect .",
    "these models they referred to as incoherent @xmath0@xmath2 dynamos . by dividing the poloidal field component by the toroidal one",
    ", they turned the mean - field dynamo equations with multiplicative noise into one with additive noise of langevin type .",
    "they drew an analogy between the behaviour of the mean magnetic field and brownian motion in the sense that the mean field does not grow although the mean - square field grows with a growth rate that scales with shear rate to the @xmath3 power .    over the last decade",
    ", the problem has been studied using a variety of different approaches @xcite .",
    "models with fluctuating @xmath0 effect , which depend on both space and time , can be divided into two categories , one in which @xmath0 is inhomogeneous @xcite and the other in which it is a constant in space .",
    "( there are other technical differences in the two approaches as well . ) in this paper we shall confine ourselves to the second class of models . for the first category , using a multiscale expansion , @xcite found a quadratic dependence of growth rate on shear rate . this result",
    "is contradicted by @xcite who found that the mean field averaged over @xmath0 does not show a dynamo and that the fluctuating @xmath0 effect adds to the diagonal components of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity tensor .",
    "@xcite have recently proposed a simple analytically tractable model , in which they consider the first and second moments ( calculated over the distribution of @xmath0 ) of the horizontally averaged mean field . the first moment shows the absence of dynamo effect , but the second moment shows exponential growth with the same scaling behaviour observed by @xcite .",
    "motivated by their study , we solve here a similar model using a technique known as _",
    "gaussian integration by parts _ to obtain the same results .",
    "we further show that , even in the absence of shear , it may be possible for incoherent @xmath1 dynamos to operate . for the model of @xcite we can also calculate the higher ( third and fourth ) order moments of the magnetic field to demonstrate that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the mean magnetic field generated by an incoherent @xmath0shear dynamo is non - gaussian .",
    "our mean - field model is designed to describe the simulations of @xcite and brrk . in particular , there is a large - scale velocity given by @xmath4 .",
    "the turbulence is generated by an isotropic external random force with zero net helicity .",
    "the mean fields are defined by averaging over two coordinate directions @xmath5 and @xmath6 . by assuming shearing - periodic boundary conditions , as done in the simulations , this averaging obeys the reynolds rules . by virtue of the divergence - less property of the mean magnetic field , v.i.z . , @xmath7 , and in the absence of an imposed mean field , @xmath8 can be set to zero .",
    "the resultant mean - field equations then have the following form ( brrk ) @xmath9 @xmath10 here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the @xmath5 and @xmath6 components of the mean ( averaged over @xmath5 and @xmath6 coordinate directions ) magnetic field , @xmath13 are the four relevant components of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity tensor and @xmath14 are the four relevant components of the @xmath0 tensor . the shear ",
    "current effect works via a non - zero @xmath15 , provided its sign is the same as that of @xmath16 . in this paper",
    "we do not consider the possibility of the shear ",
    "current effect ; hence we set @xmath17 .",
    "here we have ignored the molecular diffusivity , as we are interested in the limit of very high magnetic reynolds numbers .",
    "the fluctuating @xmath0 effect is modelled by choosing each component of the @xmath0 tensor to be an independent gaussian random number with zero mean and the following covariance ( no summation over repeated indices is assumed ) : @xmath18 we also assume that the @xmath14s are constants in space .",
    "note that dns studies of brrk have shown that the coefficients of turbulent diffusivity also show fluctuations in time , but we have ignored that in this paper . to make our notation fully transparent ,",
    "let us clearly distinguish between two different kinds of averaging we need to perform .",
    "the mean fields themselves are constructed by reynolds averaging , which in our case is horizontal averaging , and is denoted by an overbar . as we are dealing with mean field models ,",
    "the quantities appearing in our equations have already been reynolds averaged .",
    "but , as the @xmath14 in our mean field equation are stochastic , we study the properties of our model by writing down evolution equations for different moments of the mean magnetic field averaged over the statistics of @xmath14 .",
    "this is denoted by the symbol @xmath19 . to give an example , the first moment ( mean over statistics of @xmath0 ) of the @xmath5 component of the mean magnetic field is denoted by @xmath20 and the second moment ( mean square ) is denoted by @xmath21 .    in numerical studies ,",
    "such averaging has to be performed by averaging over sufficiently many simulations with independent realisations of noise , as was done by @xcite . in controlled experimental setup",
    "such ensemble averaging is done by executing the experiment several times with idential initial conditions . in nature",
    "we expect the noise to have a finite correlation length .",
    "averaging over different realisation of the noise can then be done by averaging over spatial domains of size larger than the correlation length of the noise .",
    "note further that in the present case the components of @xmath22 undergo a random walk and are hence non - stationary .",
    "therefore we can not replace ensemble averages by time averages .",
    "it is convenient to study the possibility of a dynamo effect in fourier space . under fourier transform ,",
    "@xmath23 transform to , @xmath24 @xmath25 are a set of coupled stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) with multiplicative noise .",
    "we now want to write down an evolution equation for @xmath26 , which is the mean field averaged over the statistics of @xmath14 .",
    "note that @xmath27 is the first order moment of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the magnetic field .",
    "as the @xmath0 effect is taken to be gaussian and white - in - time it is possible to obtain closed equations of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "\\label{eq : avb}\\ ] ] if there is no shear ",
    "current effect , i.e.  @xmath17 , there is no dynamo .",
    "the fluctuations of the @xmath0 effect actually enhance the diagonal components of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity .",
    "this result agrees with @xcite who used a different model and found that the mean magnetic field does not grow .",
    "@xcite also found the same for their simplified zero - dimensional model .",
    "however , if one assumes that different components of the @xmath0 tensor are correlated , a different result can be obtained ; see section  [ alpha - mutual ] .",
    "we have used two different techniques to derive the matrix @xmath30 in . in appendix",
    "[ appendix3 ] , following @xcite , we have used a perturbation expansion in powers of noise strength .",
    "this expansion works even when @xmath0 is _ not _ white in time .",
    "however , for white - in - time @xmath0 it is enough to retain only the leading order term . in appendix  [ appendix1 ]",
    "we have used _",
    "gaussian integration by parts _ which works because of the white - in - time nature of the @xmath0 effect .",
    "this method can be easily applied to study higher order moments of the pdf of the magnetic field too .",
    "hence we shall use it extensively in the rest of this paper .",
    "although the mean magnetic field does not grow , the mean - squared magnetic field can still show growth . to study this",
    "we now write a set of equations for the time evolution of the second moment ( covariance ) of the mean magnetic field averaged over @xmath14 .",
    "we emphasise that we are not considering here the covariance of the actual magnetic field that would include also the small - scale magnetic fluctuations , which are relevant to the small - scale dynamo @xcite .",
    "the covariance of the actual magnetic field was later also considered by @xcite in connection with @xmath0@xmath2 dynamos .",
    "following @xcite , we define a covariance vector , @xmath31 the evolution equation for the covariance vector is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the only non - trivial terms in the derivation of the above equation are the terms which are products of components of @xmath0 effect and two components of the magnetic field .",
    "we evaluate them by using the same technique used to obtain ; see appendix  [ appendix1 ] for details .",
    "the characteristic equation of the matrix @xmath35 is a third order equation , the solutions of which gives the three solutions for the growth rate @xmath36 .",
    "for simplicity let us also choose @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , we take the turbulent magnetic diffusivity tensor to be diagonal and isotropic .",
    "we further note that @xmath38 and @xmath39 contribute only in enhancing the turbulent magnetic diffusivity of @xmath40 , so we can safely ignore them compared to @xmath41 . with these simplifying assumptions",
    "the equation for the growth rate reduces to @xmath42 = 0 , \\label{eq : dispersion}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 . for large enough @xmath16 we can always ignore the second term inside the parenthesis of",
    "this gives the three roots of @xmath44 as @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the three cube roots of unity , of which @xmath47 and @xmath48 have negative real parts .",
    "the same dispersion relation is obtained by @xcite .",
    "the wavenumber of the fastest growing mode , @xmath49 , is given by @xmath50 the growth rate of the fastest growing mode is given by @xmath51 this is the same scaling numerically obtained by @xcite .",
    "let us now consider a different case where shear is zero",
    ". in that case , becomes a quadratic equation in @xmath52 , @xmath53 with solutions , @xmath54 hence , it may be possible for fluctuations of @xmath0 to drive a large - scale dynamo ( in the mean - square sense ) even in the absence of velocity shear .",
    "to summarise there are two possible dynamo mechanisms in our dynamo model . in both of them",
    "the magnetic field grows in the mean - square sense .",
    "the first one is an incoherent @xmath0shear dynamo . for large enough shear",
    "this is the fastest growing mode .",
    "however , this dynamo has no oscillating modes because the modes for which @xmath44 have a non - zero imaginary part have negative real part .",
    "an incoherent @xmath1 dynamo mechanism also exists in this model .",
    "the condition for excitation of a fluctuating @xmath0shear dynamo is @xmath55 and the condition for excitation of a fluctuating @xmath1 dynamo is @xmath56 the condition that a fluctuating @xmath1 dynamo is preferred compared to an @xmath0shear one is @xmath57 or @xmath58 for @xmath59 .    to compare with dns we need to use some estimates of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we use @xmath63 , as obtained by @xcite without shear .",
    "a slightly larger value was found by brrk in the presence of shear .",
    "we further use @xmath64 . for",
    "this choice of parameters the incoherent @xmath1 dynamo does not grow . here",
    ", @xmath65 is the mean - squared velocity and @xmath66 corresponds to the characteristic fourier mode of the forcing if the turbulence has been maintained by an external force , as done by @xcite or brrk . for turbulence maintained by convection , @xmath66 should be replaced by the fourier mode corresponding to the integral scale of the turbulence .",
    "typically , mean - field theory applies for modes with @xmath67 .",
    "lengths are measured in units of @xmath68 and velocity is measured in the unit of @xmath65 .",
    "this makes @xmath69 the unit of time .",
    "the two dispersion relations are plotted in fig .",

    "( continuous lines with difference colours / grey shades from bottom to top @xmath70 ) , and ( broken line ) at the very bottom . velocity shear and @xmath44 have dimensions of inverse time and are measured in the units of @xmath71 . ]",
    "so far we have assumed that only the self - correlations of the components of the @xmath0 tensor are non - zero and the mutual correlations zero .",
    "let us now generalise to @xmath72 obviously , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "it is again possible to write a closed equation for the first moment of the magnetic field in the form @xmath75 with @xmath76\\ !",

    "current effect is taken to be zero .",
    "note that , unlike the self - correlation terms , i.e.  @xmath80 , which must be positive , the mutual correlation terms ( e.g. , @xmath81 , or @xmath82 ) can have either sign .",
    "hence , it is a - priori not clear from whether a dynamo is possible or not .",
    "however , we note two interesting possibilities below . first , the mutual correlations of the fluctuating @xmath0 now contribute to off - diagonal components of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity tensor .",
    "a dynamo is possible if @xmath83 such a dynamo might look deceptively similar to the shear ",
    "current dynamo , but is actually not so because in the regular shear ",
    "current effect @xmath15 emerges due to the presence of shear and hence must be proportional to @xmath16 for small @xmath16 .",
    "hence for a regular shear  current dynamo we would have @xmath84 and @xmath85 ; see brrk . but",
    "here @xmath86 emerges due to fluctuations of @xmath0 and may be independent of @xmath16 , at least for small @xmath16 .",
    "this would imply that @xmath87 and @xmath88 but this time even for the first moment of the magnetic field .",
    "the growth rate of such a dynamo may however be quite small as it is proportional to @xmath89 which is the _ difference _ between two terms each of which are correlations between different components of the @xmath0 tensor .",
    "secondly , if @xmath90 the fluctuating @xmath0 effect gives negative contributions to even the diagonal components of turbulent diffusivity , which is reminiscent of the result of @xcite .",
    "the essential physics of can be captured by an even simpler mean - field model in a one - mode truncation , but with fluctuating @xmath0 effect , introduced by @xcite .",
    "their model , rewritten in our notation and setting all @xmath91 factors to unity is @xmath92 this model can be analysed in exactly similar ways . by construction",
    ", this model does not have a fluctuating @xmath1 effect , and @xmath0 is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and covariance @xmath93 for this model we adopt a more general framework and define the growth - rate of the @xmath94-th order moment of the magnetic field ( the first order is the mean and the second order is the covariance ) to be @xmath95 .",
    "explicit calculations , shown in appendix  [ appendix2 ] , give @xmath96 we show in appendix  [ appendix2 ] that this two - third scaling with shear rate in this zero - dimensional model is equivalent to @xmath87 scaling for .      we note that can be considered as coupled stochastic differential equations of the langevin type but with multiplicative noise .",
    "we have taken the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the noise to be gaussian .",
    "but , by virtue of multiplicative noise , the pdf of the magnetic field may be non - gaussian .",
    "we have already calculated the first and second moments of this pdf . to probe non  gaussianity we need to calculate the higher order moments .",
    "for this is a formidable problem .",
    "but it is far simpler for the model of @xcite .",
    "@xcite has already argued that the statistics of the magnetic field in the model of @xcite is intermittent ; see also @xcite . in appendix  [ appendix2 ]",
    "we show that the growth rate for the third and fourth order moments are given by @xmath97 clearly , @xmath98 has the same scaling dependence on @xmath99 and @xmath16 , independent of @xmath94 , but nevertheless they are different , i.e. , the pdf is non - gaussian .",
    "this non - gaussianity is best described by plotting @xmath100 versus @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ fig : zetap ] .",
    "let us now conjecture that as @xmath101 , @xmath102 remains finite . remembering that @xmath103 , the general form would then be @xmath104 substituting the form back in we find @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "this formula is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : zetap ] .",
    "versus @xmath94 as obtained from .",
    "if the magnetic field had obeyed gaussian statistics , @xmath102 versus @xmath94 would have been constant . ]",
    "in this paper we have analytically solved a mean - field dynamo model with fluctuating @xmath0 effect to find self - excited solutions .",
    "we have studied the growth rate of different moments ( calculated over the statistics of @xmath0 ) of the magnetic field .",
    "there are three crucial aspects in which our results , the dns of @xcite , and the analytical results by @xcite agree : ( a ) there is no dynamo for the first moment of the magnetic field , ( b ) the second moment ( mean - square ) of the magnetic field shows dynamo action , and ( c ) the fastest growing mode has a growth rate @xmath87 at fourier mode @xmath88 . we have further shown that these aspects of our results can even be reproduced by a simpler zero - dimensional mean field model due to @xcite . for this simpler model we have also calculated the growth rate for third and fourth order moments and we have explicitly demonstrated the non - gaussian nature of the pdf of the magnetic field . given that the incoherent @xmath0shear dynamo ( often with an additional coherent part ) is the most common dynamo mechanism",
    "our results provide a qualitative reasoning of why large - scale magnetic fields in the universe may be intermittent",
    ". however note also that we have merely shown that the growth rates of the different moments of the magnetic field are different .",
    "the eventual nature of the pdf of the magnetic field will also be influenced by the saturation of this dynamo which is outside the realm of this paper .",
    "we have also shown that it is possible to find growth of the first moment ( mean ) of the magnetic field if mutual correlations between different components of the @xmath0 tensor are assumed to have a certain form ( section  [ alpha - mutual ] ) .",
    "it will thus be important to check such assumptions from future dns .",
    "as our paper has been inspired by @xcite it is appropriate that we compare and contrast our model and techniques with theirs .",
    "their model consists of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) with an external gaussian , white - in - time force ( in the evolution equation for velocity ) with the additional assumption that the non - linear term in the velocity equation is omitted .",
    "the model thus applies in the limit of reynolds number @xmath108 .",
    "they perform averaging over @xmath109-coordinates to obtain mean field equations with an @xmath0 effect which depends on the helicity averaged over coordinate directions .",
    "our mean field model is derived by first averaging over coordinate directions ( standard reynolds averaging ) with the additional assumptions on the statistics ( gaussian , white - in - time ) of @xmath0 .",
    "our results are thus not limited by the smallness of the reynolds number , although all the usual limitations of mean - field theory apply .",
    "the assumption of the gaussian nature of @xmath0 is well supported by numerical evidence ; see fig .",
    "10 of brrk .",
    "@xcite have further used a quasi - two - dimensional velocity field , but this we feel is not an important limitation .",
    "they average the first and second moment of the magnetic field over the realisations of force by using cumulant expansion in powers of the kubo number . as they truncate the expansion at the lowest order in kubo number it applies to the case of small kubo number .",
    "the most restrictive assumption in our model is the assumption of the white - in - time nature of the @xmath0 effect .",
    "this assumption however allows us to obtain closed equations for all the moments of the magnetic field .",
    "the results of @xcite is not limited by this assumption .",
    "it is interesting to note that , even under the assumption of the white - in - time nature of the @xmath0 effect , we obtain the same scaling behaviour as @xcite and the dns studies of @xcite .    here",
    ", let us also mention that @xcite have recently applied similar techniques to study _ small - scale _ kinematic dynamos in a smooth delta - correlated velocity field in the presence of shear to find @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the expression for the largest lyapunov exponent describing the divergence of two initially close fluid particles , this lyapunov exponent was earlier obtained for such flows by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this is exactly the same scaling with shear as in @xcite . in the absence of shear the small - scale dynamo",
    "can still operate @xcite with @xmath112 .",
    "@xcite have also considered a model similar to ours , although somewhat simpler and more relevant to the solar dynamo , using multiscale expansions . after averaging over the fluctuating @xmath0 effect",
    ", he still finds an effective @xmath0 effect from which he obtains a dynamo which grows in the mean ( as opposed to mean  square in our case ) .",
    "his results give the scaling , @xmath85 and @xmath84 which disagree with the dns results of @xcite .",
