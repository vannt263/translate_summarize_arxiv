    "the deepest hole that has ever been dug is about 12  km deep , a mere dent in planetary terms .",
    "geochemists analyze samples from the earth s crust and from the top of the mantle , whereas seismology can reconstruct the density profile throughout the whole earth but not its composition . in this respect ,",
    "our planet is mainly unexplored .",
    "geo - neutrinos  the antineutrinos from the progenies of u , th and @xmath1k decays in the earth  bring to the surface information from the whole planet , concerning its content of radioactive elements .",
    "their detection can shed light on the sources of the terrestrial heat flow , on the present composition and on the origins of the earth .",
    "geo - neutrino properties , summarized in table  [ table : nuproperties ] , deserve a few comments :    \\(i ) geo - neutrinos originating from different elements can be distinguished due to their different energy spectra , e.g. , geo - neutrinos with energy @xmath2  mev are produced only from the uranium chain ;    \\(ii ) geo - neutrinos from u and th ( not those from @xmath1k ) are above threshold for the classical anti - neutrino detection reaction , the inverse beta on free protons :    @xmath3    \\(iii ) anti - neutrinos from the earth are not obscured by solar neutrinos , which can not yield reaction  ( [ eq : inversebeta ] ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      +    on the other hand , the predicted signal is practically unaffected by the uncertainty on the neutrinos squared mass difference @xmath4 : when this is varied within its @xmath5 interval the signal changes by 0.1  tnu .",
    "this holds for any value of the total uranium mass @xmath6 , since the precise value of @xmath7 only matters in the region near the detector .",
    "in addition , we observe that the predictions computed for the best value ( @xmath8  ev@xmath9 ) and for the limit @xmath10 differ by + 0.3  tnu . finally , the error on the inverse - beta cross section ( quoted as 0.2% at @xmath11 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) translates into a @xmath12 uncertainty of 0.6% on the signal .",
    "we summarize here the main points of this paper :    \\(1 ) based on a detailed geochemical and geophysical study of the region near kamioka , we have determined the regional contribution to the signal from uranium - geoneutrinos : @xmath13    \\(2 ) by using global mass balance arguments , we have determined the contribution from the rest of the world : @xmath14\\mathrm{\\ tnu } \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the uranium mass in the earth , in units of @xmath15  kg .",
    "\\(3 ) our prediction for the signal as a function of @xmath6 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : kamlandsignalmass ] , which shows the potential of geo - neutrinos for determining how much uranium is in the earth ( as discussed in the paper , the range of the prediction for a given mass is mostly due to experimental determinations of local abundances and to the geometrical distributions of trace elements in the mantle ) .",
    "\\(4 ) measurements of the antineutrino signal from uranium can provide crucial tests for models .",
    "in particular , estimates by different authors for the uranium mass within the important paradigm of the bulk silicate earth are all in the range @xmath16 kg , which translates into a signal @xmath17  tnu .",
    "\\(5 ) a full exploitation of the geo - neutrino signal demands that the mixing angle is determined more precisely .",
