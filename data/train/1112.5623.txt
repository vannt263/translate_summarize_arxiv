    "it is well known that one of the most important indicators of the chaotic behaviour of a dynamical system is the rate of decay to zero of the time autocorrelation of dynamical variables .",

    "we study the decay of correlations in the general frame of the dynamical theory of hamiltonian systems , with an invariant measure .",
    "such an approach has already provided interesting results , as it allows to obtain results valid in the thermodynamic limit ( see @xcite ) .    here",

    "we finally give a numerical application to the case of the fermi - pasta - ulam system ( fpu ) . by truncating the series up to order 12 , for systems up to 364 degrees of freedom , we approximate the poles of the laplace transform of the time autocorrelation of a suitably chosen dynamical variable . some comments are made on the possibility that such approximations give indications for a sub - exponential decay of the autocorrelation .    in section  [ sez : generale ]",
    "the relevant notions on time correlation functions are recalled . in the same section",
    "we give a theorem which establishes a kind of continuity ( with respect to a suitable distance ) of time correlations in the @xmath4 space of the dynamical variables , and also theorem  [ teor : serie ] for the series expansion .",
    "section  [ sez : serie ] is devoted to a study of some general properties of the series expansion . here",
    "an interesting link with the stieltjes moment problem is pointed out ( see theorem  [ teor : stieltjes ] ) , and a necessary and sufficient criterion for the time - decay of the autocorrelation to be exponential is given as corollary  [ cor : analitico ] .",
    "a closer examination of this problem is given in appendix  [ app : hausdorff ] .",
    "then , the results of some numerical computations on the time autocorrelations of a significant variable in a fpu chain are reported in section  [ sez : numerica ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sez : conclusione ] some comments on the usefulness of the present method are also given .",
    "two more appendices complete the paper .",
    "we recall here some standard concepts within the measure theoretic approach to dynamical systems . we consider a hamiltonian system on a phase space @xmath5 endowed with a probability measure @xmath6 invariant with respect to the time flow @xmath7 induced by the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",

    "two variables are orthogonal in this metric if they are uncorrelated , i.e. , if @xmath30 , and collinear if @xmath31 .",
    "we also emphasise that , in view of the above definitions , the time autocorrelation of a function @xmath0 is nothing but the covariance between @xmath32 and @xmath0 .",
    "therefore one immediately has @xmath33 thus , the variance of a dynamical variable is the natural scale of its time autocorrelation .",
    "1ex we come now to state two useful theorems .",
    "the first one points out an interesting property of the time correlation .",
    "the mere fact that two dynamical variables are strongly correlated ( i.e. , sufficiently collinear in the scalar product given by the covariance ) entails a similar behaviour of their time autocorrelations .",
    "equivalently , we can say that in the neighbourhood of each dynamical variable @xmath0 , i.e. , in the set of all dynamical variables strongly correlated with @xmath0 , the behaviour of the time autocorrelations is determined by that of @xmath34 .",

    "1ex    a central role in this paper will be played by the formal power series expansion of @xmath34 with respect to time , which is given in the following theorem .",

    "* we use the simple chain of identities @xmath56 which hold true for any invariant measure , and the remark that @xmath57 where @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "one can check equations ( [ eq : correlazione_inversa ] ) by writing down the square at the l.h.s .",
    ", while ( [ eq : evoluzione_differenza ] ) comes from the variation of constants formula applied to @xmath59 .",
    "we go on by writing the l.h.s . of ( [ eq : correlazione_inversa ] ) as @xmath60 where , in the second line , the invariance of the measure with respect to the time evolution is used , so that the equality proceeds from a simple change of coordinates , and in the last line the same argument is used , as well as relation ( [ eq : correlazione_inversa ] ) applied to the variable @xmath61 .",
    "the order of the integrals can be exchanged if @xmath62 is finite , because the integral ( [ passo_1 ] ) is absolutely convergent in this case , in virtue of schwarz inequality . in  ( [ passo_2 ] )",

    "this gives us the relation @xmath65 where @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "the same procedure can be iterated up to @xmath67 by recursively defining @xmath49 $ ] , starting with @xmath50 , and using the hypothesis that @xmath68 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "1ex    * remark 1 . *",
    "theorem  [ teor : serie ] suggests that , at least in a formal way , one can express the time autocorrelation of a dynamical variable @xmath0 as a power series with respect to time @xmath69 to simplify the notations , we define @xmath70 we point out that all these coefficients are positive .",
    "we could have got to formula ( [ eq : serie ] ) also by expressing @xmath16 as a time power series through its lie derivatives and by integrating @xmath71 by parts , taking into account the observation that the mean value of any function which can be written as @xmath72 $ ] vanishes can replace @xmath73 in all the previous formulae .",
    "we will keep the given notation , because this way it is more straightforward to understand how to compute the coefficients of the series . ] , since @xmath74\\bigr\\rangle=\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}}{{\\mathrm{d}}t } \\langle g\\rangle$ ] .",
    "1ex    * remark 2 . * we emphasise that the term in the second line in equation ( [ eq : serie_troncata ] ) , i.e. , the remainder , turns out to be positive or negative according to @xmath75 being odd or even , respectively .",
    "therefore , the truncations of series ( [ eq : serie ] ) provide upper bounds for the time autocorrelation of @xmath0 if truncated at an odd @xmath75 , and lower bounds if truncated at an even @xmath75 . such bounds",
    "provide some information on the behaviour of the time autocorrelation of @xmath0 for finite times .",
    "the simplest example is that of the first order truncation , which proved to be very helpful for the study of relaxation times in a hamiltonian setting ( see @xcite ) .",
    "1ex    as a final remark , we point out that some _ a priori _ restrictions on the norms of the successive derivatives come from the schwarz inequality  ( [ eq : correlazione_e_varianza ] ) .",
    "indeed , one has the following proposition , whose proof is deferred to appendix  [ app : a_priori ] .",
    "[ prop : a_priori ] the coefficients @xmath76 defined by ( [ eq : definizioni_a_e_c ] ) are such that the polynomials @xmath77 , @xmath78 defined as @xmath79 with @xmath80 are positive semi - definite , for any @xmath81 .",
    "the statement of proposition  [ prop : a_priori ] entails some restrictions on the coefficients @xmath76 , since @xmath77 and @xmath78 are two - indexed sequences of positive semi - definite polynomials .",
    "unfortunately , such relations can be expressed only in a quite complicated way , through the jacobi - borchardt theorem ( see , for example , @xcite ) , which gives some relations among the roots of the polynomials , and newton s identities on the relations between the coefficients of a polynomial and its roots .",
    "in many cases one is interested in determining whether the time correlation tends to zero as @xmath82 and , if this is the case , which is the law controlling the decay .",
    "indeed , it is commonly stated that if the correlations decay exponentially fast ( for a suitable wide class of functions ) then the system is chaotic .",
    "the decay is linked to the analyticity property of the fourier transform of the correlations ( see for example @xcite ) : in particular it is well known that the fourier transform is analytic in a strip of width @xmath83 if and only if the correlation decays at least as @xmath84 .",
    "we recall that the correlations can always be expressed as the fourier transform of an even positive measure , the so called `` spectral measure '' , namely as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a positive borel measure on @xmath87 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    on the other hand , it is not so easy to get information about the spectrum : we devise to get it using the laplace transform @xmath88 of the time autocorrelation , namely , @xmath89 it is well known that the laplace transform of a function which decays faster than @xmath84 is analytic in the half - plane @xmath90 , so that , again , the control on the decay of correlations in linked to the analyticity properties of @xmath88 , as in the case of the fourier transform .",
    "the great advantage of the latter approach lays in the fact that the laplace transform of the correlation is essentially the stieltjes transform of the spectral measure .",
    "this is stated as theorem  [ teor : stieltjes ] below .",
    "the point is that , as first shown by stieltjes ( see @xcite ) , if one knows the asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath91 of a functions @xmath88 which is the stieltjes transform of a positive measure , then one can recover @xmath88 itself through a convergent scheme of continued fractions expansions , defined in terms of the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion .",
    "in other words , one can construct a rational approximation @xmath92 which converges uniformly in @xmath93 , as @xmath94 , to @xmath88 .",
    "for the case of the time autocorrelation @xmath34 , the asymptotic expansion is obtained just by integrating the expansion term by term .",
    "in fact , the laplace transform can be formally written as @xmath95 this expansion would give a convergent expansion , provided one can exchange the sum of the series with the integration over time .",
    "this is in general not permissible , in view of the fact that the expansion in power series of time converges ( in general ) only in a circle of finite radius and not up to infinity .",
    "however , it is easy to show that series ( [ eq : trasformata_serie ] ) nevertheless provides the asymptotic expansion of @xmath88 we are looking for .",
    "one has to use formula and check that the remainder grows at most as a power of time .",
    "we are now able to state the main result of this section , namely , the following theorem , together with a relevant corollary on the decay of the correlations .",

    "we come now to the proof of statement  [ prop : stieltjes_2 ] .",
    "we notice that the form of series ( [ eq : trasformata_serie ] ) recalls the stieltjes work @xcite on the link between the asymptotic series , their expansion in continued fractions and the stieltjes transform . in dealing with this subject he met with the moment problem that now bears his name .",

    "furthermore , the solution is unique if there exists @xmath120 such that @xmath121 holds ( for a proof with more recent methods , see @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that , in our case , since @xmath122 is analytic about the origin , there should exist @xmath120 such that the previous condition is satisfied , in view of the cauchy - hadamard criterion .    coming back to our problem",
    ", we collect the results of paper @xcite of interest to us in the following statement : _ if the function @xmath88 admits the representation ( [ eq : stieltjes_laplace ] ) , then the continued fraction which approximates the asymptotic expansion ( [ eq : trasformata_serie ] ) converges to @xmath88 for @xmath93 ; moreover , the stieltjes moment problem for the sequence @xmath76 is soluble .",
    "_    the previous statement is proved this way . in equation ( [ eq : stieltjes_laplace ] ) we put @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "then we have the formal chain of equalities @xmath126",
    "where again @xmath109 is a borel positive measure on @xmath102 .",
    "stieltjes showed that the continued fraction which approximates the term in brackets at the r.h.s .",
    "converges to the integral at the l.h.s , and that the stieltjes moment problem for the sequence @xmath76 has a solution for the measure @xmath109 .",
    "then it is straightforward to check that @xmath127 solves the associated symmetric hamburger moment problem , which means that @xmath128    q.e.d .",
    "1ex    * remark 4 . *",
    "notice that we have incidentally shown that the coefficients @xmath76 are such that conditions ( [ eq : soluzione_stieltjes ] ) are satisfied at any order .",
    "this restriction on the values of the coefficients , together with the analogous ones imposed by the application of the previous theorem to the dynamical variables @xmath129 , for all @xmath75 , already contains the restriction given by proposition  [ prop : a_priori ] .",
    "however , we point out that proposition  [ prop : a_priori ] holds up to a given order even if the existence of @xmath129 beyond such an order is not guaranteed .",
    "1ex    in view of corollary  [ cor : analitico ] , the question of the asymptotic behaviour of the time autocorrelations can be restated as a regularity problem for the measure @xmath109 , which solves stieltjes moment problem for the @xmath76 , or , equivalently , for @xmath86 which solves the associated hamburger moment problem .",
    "an answer to this question can be given only if the whole sequence of moments @xmath76 is known . however , it is also of interest to understand which is the qualitative difference between the approximation ( at a given order ) of an analytic measure and that of a measure with at least a singular point .",
    "we try here to give an answer to the latter question , deferring to appendix  [ app : hausdorff ] the discussion of which is the link between the behaviour of the moments and the regularity of the solution ( see proposition  [ prop : ahiezer ] , [ prop : hausdorff ] , [ prop : convergente ] therein ) .    we have already pointed out that a rational approximation @xmath130 of the laplace transform @xmath88 can be constructed from ( [ eq : sviluppo_serie ] ) by standard methods ( see chapter  2 of stieltjes memoir @xcite ) , which give @xmath131 such a function , in turn , can be rewritten as the following stieltjes integral @xmath132 in which the measure @xmath133 is piecewise constant and has a jump @xmath134 at the points @xmath135 . therefore , in order that the limiting measure @xmath136 be continuous , it is necessary that , as the approximation order grows , the poles become dense and their residues tend to zero . as a consequence ,",
    "_ we will take as a qualitative indication of a sub - exponential decay the property that the rational approximations have at least a pole which remains isolated , with a stable residue , as the order grows_.",
    "checking whether the spectral measure is analytic , or even whether the criterion of proposition  [ prop : ahiezer ] of appendix  [ app : hausdorff ] is satisfied for a concrete problem is a major task , because it requires information on an infinite number of coefficients .",
    "thus , as a first attempt to implement the ideas of section  [ sez : serie ] , we computed numerically some coefficients @xmath76 for a model which is widely studied in the literature and is of great relevance for the foundations of statistical mechanics , namely the fermi - pasta - ulam model ( fpu , see @xcite ) .",
    "it describes a one - dimensional chain of @xmath137 particles interacting through nonlinear springs .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system , after a suitable rescaling , can be written as @xmath138\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are canonically conjugated variables , while @xmath86 and @xmath141 are parameters that control the size of the nonlinearity .",
    "we choose as invariant probability measure the gibbs one , i.e. , @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the partition function and @xmath144 the temperature , and for the purpose of speeding up the numerical evaluation of the integrals involving the measure , we consider here a chain with one end point fixed and the other one free , i.e , we impose only the boundary condition @xmath145 , @xmath146 ( see footnote  [ nota : indipendenti ] below ) .",
    "we note however that a few computations made on the model in which both end - points are fixed have shown no significant difference . concerning the parameters , we consider the often studied case in which @xmath147 .",
    "the relevant fact is that as @xmath148 approaches 0 the contribution due to the nonlinear terms becomes statistically negligible .",
    "it is well known that if the nonlinear terms are neglected then the hamiltonian is integrable , admitting @xmath149 normal modes of oscillation , and that the motion is quasi periodic so that , for every @xmath150 , the energy @xmath151 of the @xmath47-th mode is a constant of motion ( and thus , as obvious , the time autocorrelation of such a dynamical variable is constant ) .",
    "our aim is to investigate what happens when the nonlinearity is introduced as a perturbation , namely , for @xmath148 positive but close to 0 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the exchange of energy among the normal modes . to this end",
    ", a good choice could be to consider the fraction of energy localized on the low frequency modes , defined , for example , as @xmath152 since its time variation is a convenient indicator of the flow of energy from low to high frequency modes , and vice versa . as a numerical tool we want to compute numerically the coefficients of the series ( [ eq : serie ] ) for this function , since , in view of theorem  [ teor : stieltjes ] , they give indications on the asymptotic behaviour of the autocorrelation .",
    "as a matter of fact , we notice that the function @xmath153 may not represent the best choice . for , such a function",
    "is strongly correlated with the hamiltonian , so that , in virtue of theorem  [ teor : correlate ] , its autocorrelation remains close to that of the hamiltonian , thus remaining far from zero .",

    "this fact is in agreement with the remark , already made by stieltjes , that the poles of the laplace transform of @xmath187 become dense on the imaginary axis and corresponds with the fact that the spectral measure is in this case analytic . on the other hand",
    ", the same fact seems to suggest a qualitatively different behaviour of @xmath188 , and in particular that @xmath100 is not analytic in this case , so that the decay of the time autocorrelation of @xmath171 is not exponential .    as a final remark",
    ", we add a few considerations concerning the actual difficulty occurring in the calculations . in view of theorem  [ teor : stieltjes ] , all poles lie on the imaginary axis and all the determinants ( [ eq : def_determinanti ] ) are positive .",
    "so , we are certain that the outcome of our computation ceases to be reliable at the order at which we encounter a negative determinant . since the coefficients are determined via a monte carlo approximation of an integral , they are subject to a numerical error .",
    "the difficulty is that increasing the order requires also a corresponding increase of the precision , and so a longer and longer calculation .",
    "this makes the whole procedure unpractical even at not too high orders , and for this reason we performed most calculations up to order 8 only , thus finding 4 frequencies .",
    "we have shown that there is a convergent algorithm which , in principle , could be implemented to get the laplace transform of the time autocorrelation of a dynamical variable , and so to get conclusions about the rate of its decay as @xmath82 . in our opinion ,",
    "the most relevant aspect is the connection we found between the spectral measure and the solution of the stieltjes moment problem , which implies a relation between the smoothness property of the measure and the fulfilment of an infinite set of constraints ( see , as an example , proposition  [ prop : hausdorff ] in appendix  [ app : hausdorff ] ) .",
    "this leads us to the question , whether smooth measures are in some sense exceptional , namely , to ask whether these constraints can still be satisfied when small changes in the moments are performed ( i.e. , by generic small perturbations of the hamiltonian flow ) .",
    "implementing such an algorithm on a computer raises major difficulties with respect to both the computational time and the reliability of the results . as a matter of fact",
    ", the main problem is connected with the calculation of large determinants .",
    "however , we tried to apply the method to two functions of interest fro the fpu problem , namely , the energy of a packet of low frequency modes and the kinetic energy of half of a fpu chain . for the first function , our results seem to support the conjecture that the time autocorrelations exhibit a sub - exponential decay , while no definite conclusions can be drawn for the second quantity .",
    "we remark that this is a known characteristic for chains of fpu type , namely that quantities related to the particles typically exhibit a behaviour coherent with the predictions of statistical mechanics , while this often does not happen with quantities related to the modes . on the other hand",
    ", we should emphasize that the existence of functions with a slow decay of the autocorrelations is in itself an obstacle for the ergodic behaviour of a dynamical system .",
    "for similar results , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the problem of determining a necessary and sufficient condition in order that the solution of an hamburger moment problem admit a bounded positive derivative has been solved by khz and krein ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , their criterion can not be applied to study the derivative itself .",
    "thus , we report the criterion of akhiezer and krein for checking the existence of a derivative for the hamburger moment problem for the measure @xmath86 , then we give an alternative procedure for studying the derivatives of @xmath108 , is analytic if and only if @xmath108 is ( see corollary  [ cor : analitico ] ) .",
    "] at least in the case in which the time autocorrelation is analytic on the whole real axis .",
    "we convert the problem into an hausdorff moment problem ( i.e. , a moment problem on a finite interval ) , in order to get condition on the regularity of the successive derivatives .    to state the result of @xcite of interest to us , let us introduce the definition of a non - negative definite sequence of moments @xmath76 , by requiring that @xmath191 for any @xmath75 and any sequence @xmath192 of complex numbers .",
    "defined in ( [ eq : def_determinanti ] ) are all non - negative , but the converse is not true . ]",
    "then one has    [ prop : ahiezer ] in order that @xmath107 exist and be bounded , it is necessary and sufficient that there exist @xmath193 such that the sequence @xmath194 defined by and @xmath195 . ]",
    "@xmath196 is non - negative definite .    for the study of the successive derivatives",
    ", we observe that in paper @xcite hausdorff found a solution method for the moment problem on the interval @xmath197 $ ] , which also allows to give a criterion to check whether , at any order , the derivatives of the measure exist and are bounded .",
    "such results can be also applied to our problem if the time autocorrelation is analytic on the whole real axis , because , through an analytic change of variable , one can map @xmath197 $ ] on @xmath102 and obtain the next proposition  [ prop : hausdorff ] , which provides necessary and sufficient conditions in order that the @xmath75-th derivative of @xmath108 exist and be bounded . for its statement , we need to define the auxiliary moments @xmath198 and @xmath199 : we need to preliminarily define @xmath200 then we set @xmath201 these quantities are well defined , since it is known that @xmath202 is analytic in @xmath203 and the binomial expansion converges .",
    "then , we define the quantities @xmath204 and state the following    [ prop : hausdorff ] let @xmath34 be an analytic function of @xmath96 , for @xmath205 , and let @xmath109 be the measure which solves the related stieltjes moment problem",

    "it is easy to see that this implies that the coefficients @xmath198 defined by ( [ eq : momenti_hausdorff ] ) are the moments of @xmath214 .    in order to study the derivatives of @xmath218",
    ", we pass to the the moments given by the distribution function @xmath219 .",
    "this function exists if @xmath122 is analytic on the whole real axis , because in such a case its spectral measure @xmath100 tends exponentially fast towards its limit for @xmath220 and , in consequence , @xmath212 tends towards the same limit as @xmath221 at least as fast as @xmath222 .",
    "moreover , @xmath219 admits a bounded derivative of order @xmath75 if and only if @xmath223 does .",
    "we need , thus , to find the moments of @xmath219 , which are given by @xmath224 in view of the binomial expansion of @xmath225 .",
    "since this expansion converges uniformly for @xmath226 $ ] , one can exchange the order of summation and integration and prove that these moments are indeed the @xmath227 defined by ( [ eq : momenti_hausdorff ] ) .",
    "as hausdorff proved , in order that the moment problem for the sequence @xmath227 have a solution @xmath228 on @xmath197 $ ] , which is almost everywhere differentiable with a limited derivative ( in our case , it is @xmath229 ) , it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath230 be bounded , where @xmath231 are defined by equation ( [ eq : definizioni_hausdorff ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath232 then , one considers the hausdorff moment problem in which the measure ( not necessarily positive ) is @xmath233 , and expresses its moments @xmath234 through the original moments @xmath227 , by integrating by parts .",
    "so one obtains that the coefficients @xmath235 defined by ( [ eq : definizioni_hausdorff ] ) play for @xmath233 the same role which the @xmath236 play for @xmath228 , because , for @xmath237 , and @xmath238 , since they give indications only on the discontinuities of @xmath233 , which can be disposed of , since @xmath233 can be defined at will on a set of measure zero . ]",
    "@xmath239 thus , one can express the condition that @xmath233 admits a limited derivative by asking that @xmath240 have an upper bound .",
    "the proof is then concluded by iterating this way of proceeding",
    ".    q.e.d .",
    "1ex    finally , we add the following proposition , which can be proved by the easy remark that a power series with positive coefficients , which has a radius of convergence @xmath241 , has a singularity for @xmath242 ( this is known as vivanti s theorem ) .    [ prop : convergente ] in order that the decay of the time autocorrelation of the dynamical variable @xmath0 be not exponentially fast it is sufficient that there exists @xmath243 such that @xmath244{c_n}\\le\\rho$ ]  .",
    "* remark 5 .",
    "* the condition of proposition  [ prop : convergente ] requires only to have an upper bound on the @xmath76 , whereas those of propositions  [ prop : ahiezer]-[prop : hausdorff ] ask for a more detailed knowledge on the coefficients @xmath76 .",
    "we believe that the first one is seldom fulfilled ( an example in which it is fulfilled is that of a harmonic oscillator ) . for , the @xmath75-th derivative of a function usually grows as @xmath245 , so that @xmath246{c_n}=+\\infty\\ .\\ ] ] the other requirements enables us to deal with a larger class of variables , but , as just said , it has the drawback of needing a very detailed knowledge of all coefficients .",
    "consider the series ( [ eq : serie_troncata ] ) , and recall that the remainder has a definite sign .",
    "due to the inequalities ( [ eq : correlazione_e_varianza ] ) we readily get the bounds @xmath247 which hold true because the remainder is negative in the first case and positive in the second one .",
    "setting @xmath248 , we get the inequalities @xmath249 i.e. , the polynomials @xmath250 and @xmath251 are positive semi - definite for @xmath252 .",
    "look now for the real roots of the equations @xmath253 and @xmath254 , with @xmath255 .",
    "since @xmath250 and @xmath251 are polynomials of degree @xmath167 in which @xmath167 changes of sign occur , descartes rule of signs implies that such roots , if they exist , must be positive .",
    "thus @xmath256 and @xmath257 are positive semi - definite on the whole real axis , i.e. , the inequalities ( [ eq : richiesta_coefficienti_p ] ) hold true for all @xmath258 .",
    "consider now the dynamical variable @xmath259 , calculated by recursive application of the poisson bracket with @xmath3 . by a straightforward application of theorem  [ teor : serie ]",
    "we get that the coefficients of @xmath260 are precisely @xmath261 as defined in  ( [ eq : coefficienti_generalizzati ] ) . since the argument above applies to any dynamical variable",

    "whereas the latter application is trivial , we remark that the former is obtained by explicitly expressing the force @xmath269 as a function of @xmath162 and @xmath161 , then by writing @xmath270 as the term at the r.h.s . involves only derivatives of @xmath162 up to order @xmath271 , the scheme can be applied iteratively to obtain all the derivatives of @xmath162 ( and @xmath161 ) with respect to time .      for positive integers @xmath272 we introduce the sets @xmath273 where @xmath274 is the set of non negative integers .",
