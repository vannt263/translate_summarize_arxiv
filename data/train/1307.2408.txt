    "collective synchronization of coupled oscillators is a fascinating phenomenon , where non - identical oscillators are spontaneously coherent at the same frequency with identical phase angles with each cycle ( or a repeating sequence of phase angles over consecutive cycles ) with diverging scales .",
    "this cooperative behavior is ubiquitous in real systems from well - known examples , josephson junction arrays , chemical oscillators and flashing of fireflies  @xcite , to most recent examples , such as power grids  @xcite , chimera states in oscillator networks  @xcite , and neural networks  @xcite .    from theoretical point of view",
    ", such a remarkable phenomenon has also become a central issue as an universal concept in nonlinear science  @xcite .",
    "kuramoto introduced a mathematically tractable model of coupled nonlinear oscillators  @xcite as refining the earlier model by winfree  @xcite .",
    "since then , the kuramoto model ( km ) has played a role as the paradigmatic model of synchronization .",
    "the km is simple but exhibits rich behaviors ; among them , the synchronization transition is one of fundamental problems . at the transition ,",
    "oscillators phases are tuned by the critical coupling strength against non - identical natural frequencies , and eventually reach a phase - locked state ( frequency entrainment ) including in - phase synchronization with exactly the same value .",
    "a continuous synchronization transition in the km was firstly characterized in the mean - field ( mf ) picture , and accomplished by solving a self - consistent equation of the order parameter .",
    "the mf solution of critical exponents associated with the order parameter ( @xmath7 ) and the correlation volume ( @xmath8 ) were obtained as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively  @xcite , where @xmath11 is the reduced control parameter and natural frequencies were randomly assigned from the gaussian distribution . however , based on the fss theory and heuristic arguments , the fss exponent @xmath12 has been re - obtained as @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "it was taken into account for size - dependent sample - to - sample fluctuations in natural frequencies , but numerical confirmation was not entirely satisfactory due to finite - size effects .",
    "meanwhile , it has been also reported that _ thermal noise _ , _ quenched disorder _ of natural frequencies , and _ link disorder _ of coupled oscillators ,",
    "can also be relevant to the value of the fss exponent  @xcite .    in the absence of exact solutions , numerical tests are inevitable , which is limited to finite systems related to computing facilities .",
    "this issue has long been recognized in phase transitions and critical phenomena . while fss has played a crucial role in its remedy",
    ", it requires the steady - steady limit of finite systems , which takes quite a long computation time in the numerical sense . up to now",
    ", the fss analysis of phase synchronization has been carried out based on the steady - state limiting data only .",
    "so one can naturally pose the following question : what if there are only temporal data available ?",
    "is there any systematic approach to deal with them ?",
    "the answers will be carefully addressed in this paper .",
    "we propose an extended fss form of the phase order parameter , which provides another comprehensive view of synchronization with the connection of dynamic scaling to fss near and at the criticality .",
    "in particular , we focus on how the order parameter behaves in the true scaling regime before it gets into the steady state , involved with the fss exponent . owing to the dynamic scaling analysis",
    ", we successfully confirm the theoretical value @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , we also show @xmath10 , which is clearly distinct from it in the presence of thermal noise . as a final remark",
    ", we discuss the oscillatory behavior of the order parameter in time with two scaling regimes .",
    "this occurs when the km starts at an incoherent state with fluctuation - free natural frequencies by the regular sampling from the gaussian distribution .",
    "it is well known that dynamic scaling is useful in nonequilibrium systems such as surface growths  @xcite , cluster aggregation models  @xcite , and absorbing phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamic scaling analysis in synchronization models has not yet been studied seriously to our knowledge .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present dynamic scaling in synchronization and to clarify its universality issue as approaching the critical coupling strength .",

    "furthermore , we discuss the universality issue in synchronization , related to the relevance of thermal and link - disorder fluctuations of oscillators against two different sampling methods of natural frequencies .    two different initial conditions of the km are chosen to start either at a fully coherent state [ where @xmath59 : an arbitrary angle , independent of @xmath19 , so @xmath60 or at an incoherent state [ where @xmath61 is random , so @xmath62 . for a given value of @xmath24",
