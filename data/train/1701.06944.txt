    "in the past years , dynamic scenes understanding has been receiving increasing attention especially on the moving camera or multiple moving objects . motion segmentation as a part of the video segmentation is an essential part for studying the dynamic scenes and many other computer vision applications @xcite .",
    "particularly , motion segmentation aims to decompose a video into different regions according to different moving objects that tracked throughout the video . in case of feature extraction for all the moving objects from the video , segmentation of different motions",
    "is equivalent to segment the extracted feature trajectories into different clusters .",
    "one example of feature - based motion segmentation is presented in figure  [ fig : moseg_demo ] .        generally , the algorithms of motion segmentation are classified into 2 categories @xcite : affinity - based methods and subspace - based methods .",
    "the affinity - based methods focus on computing the correspondences of each pair of the trajectories , whereas the subspace - based approaches use multiple subspaces to model the multiple moving objects in the video and the segmentation of different motions is accomplished through subspace clustering . recently",
    ", some affinity - based methods @xcite are proposed to cluster the trajectories with unlimited number of missing data . however , the computation times of them are so high that require an optimizing platform to be reduced . whereas , the subspace - based methods @xcite have been developed to reconstruct the missing trajectories with their sparse representation .",
    "the drawback is that they are sensitive to the real video which contains a large number of missing trajectories .",
    "most of the existing subspace - based methods still fall their robustness for handling missing features .",
    "thus , there is an intense demand to explore a new subspace - base algorithm that can not only segment multiple kinds of motions but also handle the missing and corrupted trajectories from the real video .",
    "we propose a new framework with subspace models for segmenting different types of moving objects from a video under affine camera .",
    "we cast the motion segmentation as a two stage subspace estimation : the global and local subspace estimation .",
    "sparse pca  @xcite is adopted for optimizing the global subspace in order to defend the noise and outliers .",
    "meanwhile , we seek a sparse representation for the nearest neighbors in the global subspace for each data point that span a same local subspace . in order to solve the missing data problem and refine the local subspace estimation",
    ", we propose an error estimation and build the affinity graph for spectral clustering to obtain the clusters . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our framework is the first one to simultaneously optimize the global and local subspace with sparse representation .",
    "the remaining sections are organized as follows .",
    "the related works are discussed in section  [ sec : related ] .",
    "the basic subspace models for motion segmentation are introduced in section  [ sec : subspace ] .",
    "the proposed approach will be described in detail in section  [ sec : sparse ] .",
    "furthermore , the experimental results are presented in section  [ sec : exp ] .",
    "finally , this paper is concluded in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "during the last decades , either the subspace - based techniques @xcite or the affinity - based methods @xcite have been receiving an increasing interest on segmentation of different types of motions from a real video .    * affinity - based methods . *",
    "@xcite uses the distances of each pair of feature trajectories as the measurement to build the affinity matrix based on a translational motion model .",
    "this method can segment motions with unlimited number of missing or incomplete trajectories , which means they are robust to the video with occlusions or moving camera problems .",
    "another approach which is based on the affinity is called multi - scale clustering for motion segmentation ( msmc ) @xcite .",
    "based on the conventional image classification technique split and merge , they use the correspondences of each two features between two frames to segment the different motions with many missing data .",
    "one of the general problems of affinity - based method is highly time - consuming .",
    "they have to be implemented with an optimized platform in order to save the computation times",
    ".    * subspace - based methods . * the existing works based on subspace models can be divided into 4 main categories : algebraic , iterative , sparse representation and subspace estimation .",
    "algebraic approaches , such as generalized principal component analysis ( gpca ) @xcite , which uses the polynomials fitting and differentiation to obtain the clusters .",
    "gpca can segment the rigid and non - rigid motions effectively , but once the number of moving objects in the video increases , its computation cost increases and the precision decreases in the same time .",
    "the general procedure of an iterative method contains two main aspects : find the initial solution and refine the clustering results to fit each subspace model .",
    "random sample consensus ( ransac ) @xcite selects randomly the number of points from the original dataset to fit the model .",
    "ransac is robust to the outliers and noise , but it requires a good initial parameter selection .",
    "specifically , it computes the residual of each point to the model with setting a threshold , if the residual is below the threshold , it will be considered as inliers and vice versa .",
    "sparse subspace clustering ( ssc ) @xcite is one of the most popular method based on the sparse representation .",
    "ssc exploits a fact that each point can be linearly represented with a sparse combination of the rest of other data points .",
    "ssc has one of the best accuracy compared with the other subspace - based methods and can deal with the missing data .",
    "the limitation is that it requires a lot of computation times .",
    "another popular algorithm based on the sparse representation is agglomerate lossy compression ( alc ) @xcite , which uses compressive sensing on the subspace model to segment the video with missing or corrupted trajectories .",
    "however , the implementation of alc can not ensure that find the global maximum with the greedy algorithm . by the way alc",
    "is highly time - consuming in order to tune the parameter .",
    "our work combines the subspace estimation and sparse representation methods .",
    "the subspace estimation algorithms , such as local subspace affinity ( lsa ) @xcite , firstly project original data set with a global subspace .",
    "then the projected global subspace is separated into multiple local subspaces through k - nearest neighbors ( knn ) . after calculating the affinities of different estimated local subspaces with principle angles ,",
    "the final clusters are obtained through spectral clustering .",
    "it comes to the issue that the knn policy may overestimate the local subspaces due to noise and improper selection of the number k , which is determined by the rank of the local subspace .",
    "lsa uses the model selection ( ms ) @xcite to estimate the rank of global and local subspaces , but the ms is quite sensitive to the noise level .",
    "in this section , we introduce the motion structure under affine camera model .",
    "subsequently , we show that under affine model segmentation of different motions is equivalent to separate multiple low - dimensional affine subspaces from a high - dimensional space .",
    "most of the popular algorithms assume an affine camera model , which is an orthographic camera model and has a simple mathematical form .",
    "it gives us a tractable representation of motion structure in the dynamic scenes . under the affine camera , the general procedure for motion segmentation",
    "is started from translating the 3-d coordinates of each moving object to its 2-d locations in each frame .",
    "assume that @xmath0 represents one 2-d tracked feature point @xmath1 of one moving object at frame @xmath2 , its corresponding 3-d world coordinate is @xmath3 .",
    "the pose of the moving object at frame @xmath2 can be represented with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are related to the rotation and translation respectively .",
    "thus , each 2-d point @xmath7 can be described with equation [ eq : affine ] @xmath8 x_p = a_f x_p \\label{eq : affine}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 \\left[r_f \\",
    "t_f \\right]\\in r^{2\\times 4}$ ] is the affine transformation matrix at frame @xmath2 .",
    "the general input for the subspace - based motion segmentation under affine camera can be formulated as a trajectory matrix containing the 2-d positions of all the feature trajectories tracked throughout all the frames . given 2-d locations @xmath0 of the tracked features on a rigid moving object",
    ", the corresponding trajectory matrix can be formulated as equation [ eq : trajectorymatrix ] @xmath10 \\label{eq : trajectorymatrix}\\ ] ] under affine model , the trajectory matrix @xmath11 can be further reformulated as equation [ eq : affinew ] @xmath12_{2f\\times 4 } \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } x_1 & \\cdots & x_p\\\\ 1 & \\cdots & 1 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right]_{4\\times p } \\label{eq : affinew}\\ ] ] we can rewrite it as following , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is called motion matrix , whereas @xmath15 is structure matrix . according to equation [ affinesimple ] , we can obtain that under affine view the rank of trajectory matrix @xmath11 of a rigid motion is no more than 4 .",
    "hence , as the trajectory matrix is obtained , the first step is reducing its dimensionality with a low - dimension representation , which is called the global subspace transformation .",
    "subsequently , each projected trajectory from the global subspace lives in a local subspace",
    ". then the obstacle of multi - body motion segmentation is to separate these underlying local subspaces from the global subspace , which means the segmentation of different motions is related with segmenting different subspaces .",
    "our proposed framework extends the lsa @xcite with sparse optimization for both the global and local parts .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : overview ] , given a general trajectory matrix , we firstly transform it into a global subspace with sparse pca @xcite , which is robust to noise and outliers . furthermore , instead of the knn estimation we use the sparse neighbors to automatically find the projected data points span a same subspace . to correct the overestimation and encourage the projected data from the same subspace to be collected , we propose an error function to build the affinity matrix for spectral clustering .          due to the trajectory matrix of a rigid motion",
    "has a maximal rank 4 , most people choose the projected dimension to be @xmath16 or @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of the motions in the video .",
    "assume that the trajectory matrix is @xmath11 , where @xmath19 is the number of frames and @xmath20 is the number of extracted trajectories .",
    "the traditional way to project @xmath11 is principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite , which can be formed as following , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the covariance matrix of @xmath23 , solutions @xmath24 represent the principal components .",
    "usually , pca can be obtained through performing singular value decomposition ( svd ) for @xmath23 .",
    "the solutions @xmath24 are fully observed , which means they are constructed with all the input variables .",
    "however , if the principal components @xmath24 are built with only a few number of original variables but still can represent the original data matrix well , it should be easier to separate the underlying local subspaces from the transformed global subspace .",
    "the sparse pca technique has been proved that it is robust to the noise and outliers in terms of dimensionality reduction and feature selection @xcite , which aims to seek a low - dimensional sparse representation for the original high - dimensional data matrix .",
    "in contrast to pca , sparse pca produces the sparse principal components that achieve the dimensional reduction with a small number of input variables but can interpret the main structure and significant information of the original data matrix .    in order to contain the orthogonality of projected vectors in the global subspace",
    ", we apply the generalized power method for sparse pca @xcite to transform the global subspace . given the trajectory matrix @xmath25^t$ ] , where @xmath26 contains all the tracked @xmath20 2-d feature points in each frame @xmath2 .",
    "we can consider a direct single unit form as equation [ eq : one_spca ] to extract one sparse principal component @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes a initial fixed data point from the unit euclidean sphere @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the sparsity controlling parameter .",
    "if project dimension is @xmath32 , which means there are more than one sparse principal components needed to be extracted , in order to enforce the orthogonality for the projected principal vectors , @xcite extends equation [ eq : one_spca ] to block form with a trace function(_tr ( ) _ ) , which can be defined as equation [ eq : multi_spca ] @xmath33^m}tr(diag(y^twzn)^2 ) \\\\              & -\\sum_{j=1}^m\\gamma_j \\|z_j\\|_0 \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : multi_spca}\\ ] ] where @xmath34^t$ ] is a positive @xmath35-dimensional sparsity controlling parameter vector , and parameter matrix @xmath36 with setting distinct positive diagonal elements enforces the loading vectors @xmath37 to be more orthogonal , @xmath38 represents the _ _ stiefel manifold _",
    "_ is the set of all orthonormal k - frames in @xmath39 . ] .",
    "subsequently , equation [ eq : multi_spca ] is completely decoupled in the columns of @xmath40 as following , @xmath41 obviously , the objective function in equation [ eq : multi_spca2 ] is not convex , but the solution @xmath42 can be obtained after solving a convex problem in equation [ eq : multi_spcaconvex ] @xmath43_+ \\label{eq : multi_spcaconvex}\\ ] ] which under the constraint that all @xmath44 . in @xcite , a gradient scheme has been proposed to efficiently solve the convex problem in equation [ eq : multi_spcaconvex ] .",
    "hence , the sparsity pattern @xmath45 for the solution @xmath37 is defined by @xmath46 after equation [ eq : multi_spcaconvex ] under the following criterion , @xmath47 as a result , the seeking sparse loading vectors @xmath48 are obtained after iteratively solving equation [ eq : multi_spcaconvex ] . after normalization , the global projected subspace @xmath49 is achieved , which is embedded with multiple orthogonal underlying local subspaces .          in order to cluster the different subspaces according to different moving bodies ,",
    "the first step is finding out the multiple underlying local subspaces from the global subspace .",
    "generally , the estimation of different local subspaces can be addressed as the extraction of different data sets , which contain only the projected trajectories from the same subspace .",
    "one of the most traditional way is the local sampling @xcite , which uses the knn .",
    "specifically , the underlying local subspace spanned by each projected data is found by collecting each projected data point and its corresponding k nearest neighbors , which are calculated by the distances @xcite .",
    "however , the local sampling can not ensure that all the extracted k - nearest neighbors truly span one same subspace , which means an overestimation , especially for the video who contains a lot of degenerated / depended motions or missing data .",
    "moreover , @xcite has testified that the selection of number k is quite sensitive , which depends on the rank estimation . in this paper , for the sake of avoiding the searching for only nearest neighbors and solving the overestimation problem we adopt the sparse nearest neighbors optimization to automatically find the set of the projected data points that span a same local subspace .",
    "the assumption of sparse nearest neighbors is derived from smce @xcite , which can cluster the data point from a same manifold robustly .",
    "given a random data point @xmath50 that draw from a manifold @xmath51 with dimension @xmath52 , under the smce assumption , we can find a relative set of points @xmath53 from @xmath51 but contains only a small number of non - zero elements that passes through @xmath50 .",
    "this assumption can be mathematically defined with equation [ eq : smce ] @xmath54\\|_2 \\leq \\epsilon , \\ s.t \\ \\textbf{1}^tc_i=\\textbf{1 }   \\label{eq : smce}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 contains only a few non - zero entries that denote the indices of the data point that are the sparse neighbors of @xmath50 from the same manifold , @xmath56 is the affine constraint and @xmath20 represent the number of all the points lie in the entire manifold .",
    "we apply the sparse neighbors estimation to find the underlying local subspaces in our transformed global subspace .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sparse_neighbors ] , with the 6-nearest neighbors estimation , there are four triangles have been selected to span the same local subspace with observed data @xmath57 , because they are near to @xmath57 than the other circles .",
    "while , the sparse neighbors estimation is looking for only a small number of data point that close to @xmath57 , in this way most of the intersection area between the different local subspaces can be eliminated . in particular , we constraint the searching area of the sparse neighbors for each projected trajectory from the global subspace with calculating the normalized subspace inclusion ( nsi ) distances @xcite between them .",
    "nsi can give us a robust measurement between the orthogonal projected vectors based on their geometrically consistent , which is formulated as @xmath58 where the input is the projected trajectory matrix @xmath59 $ ] , and @xmath57 and @xmath60 represent two different projected data .",
    "the reason of using nsi distances to constraint the sparse neighbors searching area is the geometric property of the projected global subspace .",
    "nevertheless the data vectors which are very far away from @xmath57 definitely can not span the same local subspace with @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , in addition to save computation times , the selection for the searching area with nsi distances is more flexible , which has a wide range of values , than tuning the fixed parameter k for nearest neighbors .",
    "furthermore , all the nsi distances are stacked into a vector @xmath61^t$ ] , the assumption from smce in equation [ eq : smce ] can be solved with a weighted sparse @xmath62 optimization under affine constraint , which is formulated as following @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a diagonal weight matrix and defined as @xmath65 , \\sigma > 0 $ ] .",
    "the effect of the positive - definite matrix @xmath64 is encouraging the selection of the closest points for the projected data @xmath57 with a small weight , which means a lower penalty , but the points that are far away to @xmath57 will have a larger weight , which favours the zero entries in solution @xmath55 .",
    "we can use the same strategy as smce to solve the optimization problem in equation [ eq : solve_sparseneighbor ] with alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) @xcite .    as a result ,",
    "we can obtain the sparse solutions @xmath66^t$ ] with a few number of non - zero elements that contain the informations and connections between the projected data point and its estimated sparse neighborhoods . as investigated in smce @xcite , in order to build the affinity matrix with sparse solution @xmath67 we can formulate a sparse weight matrix @xmath68 with vector @xmath69 , which is built by @xmath70 .",
    "the achieved weight matrix @xmath71 contains only a few non - zero entries in column , which give the indices of all the estimated sparse neighbors and the distances between them .",
    "hence , we can collect each data @xmath57 and its estimated sparse neighbors @xmath72 into one local subspace @xmath73 according to the non - zero elements of @xmath69 .",
    "although the sparse neighbors optimization can help us to avoid the intersection between different local subspaces , it turned into quite sensitive and ca nt ensure to carry all the information about the underlying local subspaces under the missing data situation .",
    "the local subspace estimation after the sparse neighbors searching can be illustrated with figure  [ fig : incorrect_estimation ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : incorrect_estimation ] the estimated local subspaces are not completely spanned by each observed data and its corresponding sparse neighborhood .",
    "obviously , there are some neighbors have been estimated to span two different local subspaces , which can be called the overlapping estimation .",
    "moreover , the obtained local subspaces with some overlapping problems can not carry the enough dissimilarity or similarity information between two local subspaces , which can be used to build an affinity matrix that can separate the different subspaces with spectral clustering .",
    "are four estimated local subspaces spanned by the observed data @xmath74 respectively . ]    for purpose of estimating these overlapping and making a strong connection between the data points from the same local subspace , we propose the following error function with equation [ eq : error_estimation ] @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the basis of estimated local subspace @xmath77 , which can be achieved through the svd of @xmath73 , and @xmath78 is the _ moore - penrose inverse _ of @xmath79 , the @xmath80 is an identity matrix .",
    "actually the geometrical meaning of the error function @xmath81 is the distance between the estimated local subspace and projected data .",
    "more specifically , if the projected data @xmath82 truly comes from the local subspace @xmath73 , the corresponding error @xmath81 should have a very small value , which ideally is near to zero , and vice versa . as a consequence ,",
    "after computing for each estimated local subspace @xmath73 its corresponding error vector @xmath83 $ ] , we can build an error matrix @xmath84 $ ] , which contains the strong connection between the projected data span a same local subspace . in the end",
    ", we can construct our affinity graph @xmath85 with combining the estimated error matrix @xmath86 and the sparse weight matrix @xmath71 , whose the nodes @xmath87 represent all the projected data points and edges @xmath88 denote the distances between them . in our affinity graph ,",
    "the connection between each two nodes @xmath57 and @xmath89 is determined by both the @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , our constructed affinity graph contains only several connected elements , which are related to the data points span the same subspace , whereas there is no connection between the data points live in a different subspace .",
    "more formally , the adjacent matrix of the affinity graph is formulated as follows @xmath92 = |\\omega_i|+|{e}_i|\\\\ & \\mathcal{a } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc } a[1 ] & 0 & ... & 0 \\\\ 0 & a[2 ] & ... & 0\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\ 0 & 0 & ... & a[p ] \\end{array}\\right ] \\gamma \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : affinity_matrix}\\ ] ] where the @xmath93 is an arbitrary permutation matrix .",
    "subsequently , we can perform the normalized spectral clustering @xcite on the symmetric matrix @xmath94 and obtain the final clusters with different labels , and each cluster is related to one moving object .",
    "our proposed framework is evaluated on both the hopkins 155 dataset @xcite and the freiburg - berkeley motion segmentation dataset  @xcite with comparing with state - of - the - art subspace clustering and affinity - based motion segmentation algorithms .    * implementation details * most popular subspace based motion segmentation methods @xcite have assumed that the number of motions has been already known . for the hopkins 155 dataset",
    ", we give the exactly number of clusters according to the number of motions , while for the berkeley dataset we set the number of clusters with 7 for all the test sequences . in this work , the constrained area for searching the sparse neighbors",
    "is firstly varied in a range variables @xmath95 $ ] , then it turns out that the tuned constrained area performs equally well from 20 to 50 , so we choose to set the number with 20 , which according to the alternative number of sparse numbers . in our experiments , we have applied the pca and sparse pca for evaluating the performance of our framework on estimating the multiple local subspaces from a general global subspace with dimension @xmath96 .",
