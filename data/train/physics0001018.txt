    "the main result of our work is the discovered possibility to purposefully create in the cavity quasistable states close to fock states .",
    "we analyzed the dynamics of the micromaser pumped by @xmath0-atomic clusters  @xcite .",
    "our approach generalizes the basic model of the one atom micromaser  @xcite and can be experimentally realized .",
    "we assumed the point - like nature of @xmath0-atomic clusters .",
    "this assumption can easily be realized in practice when clusters are created in a gas flow by focused laser pulses in the light range . in this case",
    "the width of the beam is of order of few microns while the size of the cavity can be of order of few millimeters . in our work",
    "we have pointed out the conditions when the time evolution of a ( sub)diagonal of the reduced density matrix is independent of the other elements of the density matrix .",
    "we have investigated the properties of the spectrum of the evolution operator ( see figures 1,2 ) and discussed their connection to the properties of the rdm dynamics . we have discussed the hierarchy of the time scales of the micromaser dynamics and have shown that the sectors of the spectrum around zero are responsible for rapid processes while the sectors close to 1 correspond to quasi - equilibrium .",
    "for the first time in the existing literature we have introduced an important notion of the _ quasitrapped states_. the figure 6 shows that these states are close to the fock states .",
    "the domains in the fock space corresponding to quasitrapping are rather narrow , their locations change smoothly with variations of the number of atoms in the cluster .",
    "this means that the overall picture of the dynamics is stable with respect to small variations of the number of atoms in a cluster . in our future work",
    "we plan to investigate this phenomenon in a greater detail as well as to study how the properties of the quasitrapped states depend on the choice of the initial density matrix of the @xmath0-atomic cluster",

    "<S> the interaction time is chosen as @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues @xmath36 are positive and do not exceed 1 . </S>",
    "<S> their mutual positions are defined by the parameter @xmath2 and the number of atoms @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> for the one - atom micromaser the so - called trapped states are known . </S>",
    "<S> these are the fock states for the number of photons @xmath38 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath39 of the matrix @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this number of photons fulfills the trapping condition @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an integer number . </S>",
    "<S> the trapped states do not decay in the absence of relaxation , and thus determine the dynamics of @xmath15 for large @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experimental realization of the trapped states was reported in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the figure 1 shows that in the multi - atomic case there are no trapped states . </S>",
    "<S> there are however a few eigenvalues which are close to 1 . </S>",

    "<S> it is interesting to notice that the eigenvalues of the evolution operator tend to group around zero when the number of atoms in the cluster increases . in the hierarchy of dynamical processes in the micromaser </S>",
    "<S> the small eigenvalues are responsible for the rapid phase of the dynamics ( with respect to the discrete time @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quasitrapped states corresponding to the eigenvalues in the interval @xmath46 are in turn responsible for the slow phase of dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> probabilities of the states with corresponding photon numbers at certain stages of the field formation can be rather high . in figure 2 </S>",
    "<S> we compare the spectrum of the evolution operator @xmath45 for the cases with ( @xmath47 ) and without relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> the figure 2 shows in particular that for bigger @xmath0 the spectrum of @xmath45 is more stable towards the influence of relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> the relation eq.([2a ] ) describes the transition of the diagonal elements of rdm to a stationary state . </S>",
    "<S> this transition process is determined by the pumping of the cavity field by passing clusters as well as by the relaxation of the field . </S>",
    "<S> the recent literature discusses mostly  @xcite the properties of the stationary state , which can be achieved when a large number of clusters has gone through the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this case corresponds to the asymptotic limit @xmath48 . in this work we concentrate on the properties of the transition process which </S>",
    "<S> , due to the existence of the quasitrapped states , are very interesting . </S>",
    "<S> the field rather rapidly `` forgets '' its initial state of the thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the population of the fock states shows instead the formation of long - living ( with respect to the `` time '' @xmath17 ) quasi - equilibrium distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by the properties of spectrum of the evolution operator given in figures 1,2 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the eigenvalues close to 1 indicates considerable probabilities of the fock states with photon numbers in the vicinities of the maxima . </S>",
    "<S> the small eigenvalues correspond to the sharp depletion of the corresponding fock states . </S>",
    "<S> the figure 1 shows that in the chosen interval of fock numbers , @xmath49 , and for @xmath50 there are three domains capturing considerable probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> these domains , which are natural to call the domains of _ quasitrapping _ are localized in the vicinities of the fock numbers @xmath51 and contain almost all the probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> this means that they are getting populated at different `` moments '' of `` time '' @xmath17 in relays : the next domain can not get populated until the previous one is depleted . </S>",
    "<S> this relay of populations is illustrated in figures 3,4,5 . </S>",
    "<S> the figure 3 show for @xmath52 how the sums of probabilities of the fock states change with @xmath17 in the second ( @xmath53 ) and the third ( @xmath54 ) domains of quasitrapping . </S>",
    "<S> the rates of probability change are calculated through eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 5 ] ) i.e. as the flux differences through the boundaries of the chosen domains . </S>",
    "<S> the figure 3 allows to identify the following stages of the @xmath17-dynamics : a period of accumulation of the probability which corresponds to the positive values of the probability rate as well as an extended in time ( @xmath17 ) period of the negative probability rates . </S>",
    "<S> the lasting nature of the latter period indicates that the life - time of the quasitrapped states is considerable . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of decay of the second quasitrapped state ( @xmath55 ) is approximately the rate of accumulation in the third state ( @xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that through a passage of a cluster the probability is almost fully relayed from the second quasitrapped state to the third . </S>",
    "<S> since the dynamics of the decay of the second quasitrapped state is slow , so is the dynamics of the accumulation in the third state . in figures 4 and 5 </S>",
    "<S> are given dependencies on @xmath17 of total populations curves of the domains of quasitrapping . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident from figures 4 and 5 that the sum of populations of two subsequent domains of quasitrapping is close to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this again manifests the full accumulation of the probabilities in the domains of quasitrapping as well as the relay of probabilities indicated above . </S>",
    "<S> the figure 6 shows the distributions of the diagonal elements of the rdm taken at the @xmath17 -moments of maximal probabilities of the fock states in the corresponding domains of quasitrapping . as follows from figure 6 it is possible to govern the vector of photon number distribution </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by the variation of the number of atoms passed through the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible in particular to create states close to the fock states localized at certain photon numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we can also report that a domain of the localization changes smoothly in accord with variations of parameters @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the stationary field on these parameters for @xmath58 was discussed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to engineer quantum states is actively studied in the recent literature  @xcite . </S>"
