    "superfluidity , and its characteristic manifestation as a state with quantized circulation ( a vortex ) , is intimately connected with the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation , yet the precise relation between superfluid persistent currents and bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  is only beginning to be elucidated @xcite . before 1995 , the link between superfluidity and bec was almost exclusively studied in the context of liquid helium ( @xmath0he and @xmath1he ) @xcite , where the study of the relation between superfluidity and bec is complicated by the strong interatomic interactions between the atoms in the liquid . in 1995 , bose - einstein condensation was realized in magnetically trapped clouds of alkali atoms @xcite . in these novel condensates , the bosonic atoms are weakly interacting ( contrary to the case of liquid helium ) , and as such these systems have the potential to shed new light on superfluidity .",
    "soon after the initial creation of alkali gas condensates , several experimental groups set out to create a vortex  a quantum of superfluid circulation  in this novel system @xcite .",
    "the initial attempts to create a vortex in a condensate by stirring the trapped condensate with a blue detuned laser beam @xcite were unsuccessful , even though early theoretical work by dalfovo _",
    "_ indicated that persistent superfluid currents can indeed manifest themselves in bose - einstein condensates as vortices @xcite .",
    "subsequent analysis @xcite showed that vortices are unstable in the simply - connected , not - stirred , spin - polarized condensates formed in the original experiments @xcite .",
    "this can be understood as follows . along the vortex line",
    ", the order parameter of the bose - einstein condensate has to vanish .",
    "phrased metaphorically , a `` hole '' has to be `` drilled '' in the condensate along the vortex line . in the magnetic trap ,",
    "the modulus square of the order parameter of a condensate without a vortex is largest in the center of the trap . as a consequence",
    ", a vortex line through the center of the trap will perturb the order parameter more than a vortex line at the edge of the condensate ( since , using our metaphor again , it will cost more energy to `` drill '' through the center of the condensate than through its edge )",
    ". it will be energetically favorable for the vortex line to be at the edge of the condensate . in the presence of dissipation",
    ", this will cause the vortex line to migrate to the edge of the condensate so that the vortex condensate will decay into a non - vortex state .",
    "this argument , sketched here with some roughness , has been worked out with precision by fetter and co - workers in @xcite .",
    "several schemes have been proposed , both theoretically and experimentally , to stabilize vortices : rotating the trapping potential ( analogous to rotating a bucket containing @xmath0he ) @xcite or stirring the condensate with an off - resonance laser @xcite , raising the temperature ( to ` pin ' the vortex in the potential created by the non - condensate fraction at the center of the vortex ) @xcite , phase imprinting methods @xcite , and various other techniques @xcite .",
    "recently , vortices were created experimentally , both with a ` rotating bucket ' experiment @xcite and with the use of a two - component condensate @xcite . in the latter experiment ,",
    "one of the components of the spinor condensate ` pins ' the vortex present in the other component and a ramsey type interference between the two components is used to detect the vortex .",
    "the long lifetimes of the two - component condensates in ref .",
    "@xcite is due to similar singlet and triplet scattering lengths of rubidium , resulting in an anomalously low inelastic loss rate @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , stable vortices have not yet been realized in a spin - polarized condensate in non - rotating traps , and new methods of stabilization and detection must be developed .",
    "a promising scheme , based on an analysis similar to that of fetter @xcite , is the use of multiply - connected condensates .",
    "a candidate trap to create a multiply connected condensates consists of a red - detuned laser beam in a laguerre - gauss mode @xcite , which we discuss in section ii .",
    "if the condensate order parameter has a toroidal geometry , a vortex line threaded through the cylindrical symmetry axis of the torus will not perturb the condensate order parameter strongly , and moreover create a metastability barrier for vortex decay .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to verify this statement about vortex stability ( in section iii ) . in a condensate with a toroidal order parameter",
    ", the vortex line can no longer be detected as a line along which the density of bose - einstein condensed atoms vanishes . to detect vorticity ,",
    "we propose ( in section iv ) a method based on interference , similar to that proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite for simply connected condensates .",
    "toroidal confinement for ultracold atoms can be obtained by an optical dipole trap @xcite which consists of a laser beam in a laguerre - gaussian mode . the laguerre - gaussian mode @xmath2 is characterized by an intensity profile given by @xcite :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the radial distance from the center of the beam , @xmath5 is the position along the propagation direction of the beam , @xmath6 ( referred to as the ` waist parameter ' ) is a parameter controlling the minimal width of the beam , @xmath7 is the wave number of the laser , and @xmath8 is the laguerre polynomial of order @xmath9 .",
    "such laser beams have modes which show a node in the center , and trap the atoms in a cylindrical shell around the axis of propagation of the beam .",
    "the intensity profile of the laser beam in the laguerre - gaussian mode is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "laguerre - gaussian ( lg)laser beams have already been used to successfully trap atoms @xcite , and subsequent theoretical work has shown that toroidal traps formed by a red - detuned lg  beam can be loaded from initial conditions similar to those of conventional magnetic traps @xcite .",
    "once the trap has been loaded , one possibility to create a vortex in the trapped gas would be by a phase imprinting method , which already successfully resulted in the creation of solitons in condensates @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a rotating perturbing potential can be used to stir the condensate and set up persistent flow in the toroidal geometry @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the properties of the vortex bose - einstein condensate , optically trapped by a laser beam in a laguerre - gaussian propagation mode @xmath10 . along the @xmath5-axis ( the direction of propagation of the laser beam ) an additional magnetic trap @xcite results in a parabolic @xmath5-axis confinement with frequency @xmath11 , which prevents the atoms from escaping along the direction of propagation of the laser beam .",
    "this ` plugging ' of the optical trap was achieved in @xcite by using blue - detuned ` plugging beams ' .",
    "the condensate in the laguerre - gauss geometry @xcite will be denoted by ` laguerre - gaussian condensate ' ( lg condensate ) , in contrast with the condensate in a parabolic confinement .",
    "the intensity profile of such a laguerre - gauss beam in the @xmath12-plane ( where @xmath5 is the axis of propagation of the laser beam ) , given by ( [ lgi ] ) , is shown in figure 1 . in the remainder of this paper , we use units so that @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the mass of the atoms ) . in these units ,",
    "the laser beam parameters for figure 1 are chosen as follows : @xmath15 .",
    "figure 2 illustrates a surface of constant intensity of the laser beam ; a hollow cylindrical shell .",
    "this will also be the shape of the cloud of trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "the extension of the cloud along the @xmath5-axis can be tuned by selecting the @xmath11 frequency of the magnetic trap along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "confined bose - einstein condensates are well described by a mean - field theory where the properties of the condensate are derived from a complex function @xmath16 .",
    "this function ( the order parameter ) is interpreted as a macroscopic wave function and obeys the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite : @xmath17 in ( [ gp ] ) arises from the interparticle interaction potential , which is treated as a contact potential with scattering length @xmath18 so that @xmath19 where @xmath14 is the mass of an atom .",
    "the optical confinement is generated by a red - detuned laguerre - gaussian laser beam in the @xmath20 mode , with waist parameter @xmath6 and wave number @xmath7 , and propagating along the @xmath5-axis @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , a harmonic confinement ( characterized by a frequency @xmath11 ) is present which confines the atoms along in the @xmath5-direction to a region @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the potential energy corresponding to this geometry is given , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath22 , by : @xmath23 in the present treatment , the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gp ] ) will be solved variationally @xcite .",
    "consider for this purpose the following two trial functions , expressed in cylindrical coordinates @xmath22 : @xmath24 the variational parameters in the trial functions are @xmath25 , controlling the width of the functions in the radial direction ; @xmath26,@xmath27 , controlling the widths in the @xmath5-direction ; and @xmath28 controlling the radial displacement of the maximum of the function away from the @xmath5-axis .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are normalization constants , which are determined by demanding that the norm of the trial function equals the number of particles in the condensate .    the circulation around a closed loop in the trapped , interacting bose gas is defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the phase of the order parameter solving the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gp ] ) .",
    "the single - valuedness of the order parameter ensures that the circulation in the trapped bose gas is quantized : @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "a vortex is present whenever @xmath35 .",
    "the trial function @xmath36 has a constant phase and hence there is no circulation , no vortex . on the other hand , the phase of @xmath37 changes by @xmath38 along any closed loop encircling the @xmath5-axis .",
    "thus @xmath39 is a trial function for the order parameter of a condensate with one quantum of vorticity : its circulation equals @xmath40 .",
    "the trial function @xmath39 must have a node along the @xmath5-axis ( the factor @xmath41 in expression ( [ psiv ] ) ) : if this node were not present , the variational kinetic energy would diverge along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "we have used @xmath42 and @xmath39 as variational trial functions to solve the gross - pitaevskii equation for a condensate without and with a vortex , respectively .",
    "the resulting variational energy is shown in figure 3 as a function of @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of atoms and @xmath45 .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is a dimensionless measure of the strength of the interaction : upon increasing @xmath46 the interatomic interaction becomes more repulsive .",
    "the energy of the lg condensate with a vortex is larger than the energy of the lg condensate without a vortex for all interaction strengths investigated .",
    "the difference is smallest for the non - interacting gas and increases monotonically as @xmath43 increases .",
    "this means that for all investigated interactions strengths the vortex lg condensate is either metastable or unstable . in inset ( a ) of figure 3",
    ", the optimal value of the variational parameters @xmath47 are shown for both trial functions as a function of the interaction strength .",
    "both the variational trial function of the lg condensate with vortex and without vortex are broadened under the influence of the repulsive interactions .",
    "a laguerre - gaussian condensate with a vortex can be metastable if there exists an energy barrier separating this state from a state without a vortex . in this section",
    "we estimate the height of the energy barrier both by the method proposed by benakli _",
    "@xcite for 2d traps , and by the method proposed by fetter and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical and the microscopic instabilities studied by fetter and co - workers @xcite involve the displacement of the vortex core relative to the center of the trap . as discussed in the introduction , for a parabolically trapped condensate it is energetically favorable for the distance between the vortex core and the center of the trap to increase . thus , if dissipation is present , the vortex condensate in the parabolic trap can decay into a non - vortex condensate through a migration of the vortex to the edge of the cloud .",
    "this effect is difficult to observe experimentally , since the vortex core can tilt and the image contrast between the vortex core and the cloud of atoms is reduced @xcite .    to estimate the height of the energy barrier separating the vortex condensate from the condensate without a vortex in our present case ,",
    "we introduce a third variational function to represent the order parameter of a vortex lg - condensate where the vortex core is at a given distance @xmath48 from the cylindrical symmetry axis of the laguerre - gauss trapping beam : @xmath49 the function @xmath50 gives the distance between the point @xmath51 and the vortex core : @xmath52 and the function @xmath53 gives the angle between the line connecting the vortex core with the point @xmath54 and the @xmath55-axis : @xmath56 the parameters @xmath57 are determined variationally for every studied distance @xmath48 between the vortex core and the center of the trapping geometry ( the axis of propagation of the lg beam ) , and @xmath58 is a normalization constant .",
    "the limit @xmath59 retrieves the results for the vortex condensate studied earlier . in the limit @xmath60",
    ", the result tends to the result for the condensate without a vortex . using the variational approach , we calculate the energy @xmath61 of the displaced vortex state for any intermediate @xmath48 .",
    "if the energy @xmath61 decreases monotonously with increasing @xmath48 , the vortex is unstable - in the presence of dissipation the vortex condensate will decay . if there exists a maximum energy @xmath62 for an @xmath63 different from zero , there is an energy barrier @xmath64 which will hinder the vortex decay .    in figure 4 ,",
    "the energy barrier @xmath65 is shown as a function of @xmath66 the dimensionless measure of the interaction strength used in the previous section .",
    "the calculations were performed for a configuration so that @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 .",
    "we found that a metastability barrier exists ( @xmath71 ) for @xmath72 this means that vortices are metastable only if the effective interaction strength ( controlled by the scattering length , the number of atoms and the confinement strength ) is large enough : the metastability is induced by interactions . upon further increasing the interaction strength above the threshold value , the metastability barrier increases .",
    "the variational energy @xmath61 is shown as a function of @xmath48 in the insets : once for an interaction strength such that the vortex is not stable , and once for a situation where the vortex is metastable .",
    "a reasonable estimate of the experimental parameters required to realize this trapping geometry gives @xmath73",
    "@xmath74 m and @xmath75 hz . this implies that for @xmath76rb , the critical number of trapped atoms necessary to make vortices metastable is of the order of @xmath77 .",
    "since one can reasonably expect to trap more than @xmath78 atoms in the trap , vortices created in a bose gas in the confinement potential mentioned above , will be well into the metastable regime ( @xmath79 for @xmath80 ) .      the other method which we used to study the metastability of the vortices in laguerre - gauss condensates ,",
    "was proposed by benakli _",
    "@xcite for 2d traps with a an axial hole , punctured by an off - resonance laser beam . in this method , a trial solution for the gross - pitaevskii equation is constructed as a superposition between the vortex state and the state without a vortex : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 of this superposition , the function changes from that of a lg condensate with a vortex to that without a vortex .",
    "if the energy of the intermediate states is found to be higher than the energy of the vortex state , this constitutes an energy barrier against uniform transition from vortex state to the state without a vortex , making the former metastable .    using the variationally optimized trial functions for the order parameter of a lg condensate with a vortex and without a vortex",
    ", we found with the method of benakli _ et al .",
    "_ that such a metastability barrier exists for @xmath84 the dependence of the energy barrier on @xmath85 is shown in figure 5 . in the inset of figure 5 ,",
    "the variational energy of the trial function @xmath86 is shown as a function of latexmath:[$%    threshold value for metastable vortices .",
    "the calculations were performed for a configuration so that @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath88 @xmath89 .",
    "note that the method of ref .",
    "@xcite followed here does not describe the decay of vortices mediated by the excitations , for example by nucleation of vortex loops .",
    "however , for a two - dimensional system punctured by an off resonance laser beam , benakli _ et al . _ @xcite could show that excitation - mediated decay of vortices only becomes appreciable for vortices in higher angular momentum states .",
    "furthermore , for a purely one - dimensional toroidal system , kagan _",
    "@xcite showed that for a weakly interacting system at low temperature , the relaxation time for the decay the superfluid persistent current due to phonons is strongly suppressed .",
    "both the method of fetter @xcite and the method of benakli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite give qualitatively the same result , namely that above a critical strength of interaction , expressed by @xmath43 , the vortex state of the lg condensate is stabilized by a metastability barrier .",
    "quantitative differences remain between the two methods , which is to be expected since they describe different possible mechanisms of vortex decay .",
    "the general conclusion  the stabilization of the vortex state due to the toroidal geometry  is further supported by a calculation for a vortex condensate in a mexican hat potential @xcite.the metastability barrier calculated as by the method of ref .",
    "@xcite is smaller than the barrier calculated used the method of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath90 , which indicates that the latter method @xcite overestimates the real metastability barrier .",
    "phase coherence , a property necessary for the existence of vortices , was demonstrated experimentally using interference experiments @xcite .",
    "two parabolically trapped condensates , displaced by a given distance , are allowed to expand freely . in the region where the two expanding condensates overlap , an interference pattern is observed .",
    "this type of experiment has also been proposed to observe vorticity in parabolically trapped condensates @xcite : the presence of a vortex leads to an observable _ edge dislocation _ in the pattern of otherwise parallel interference fringes .",
    "consider a parabolically trapped condensate positioned on the symmetry axis of the lg condensate .",
    "the lg condensate forms a cylindrical shell surrounding the parabolically trapped condensate in the center .",
    "as the trapping potentials are switched off , both condensates will expand and exhibit an interference pattern in the region of overlap .",
    "this interference pattern is the subject of the present section .    to find the function representing the order parameter at a given time @xmath91 after the start of the free expansion",
    ", the original function @xmath92 is expanded in free particle eigenfunctions .",
    "these eigenfunctions acquire a phase factor as time elapses , so that @xmath93 at a time @xmath91 is given by the resummed expansion with the ` time evolved ' eigenfunctions .",
    "more explicitly , for the lg condensate with a vortex , first the coefficients of the plane wave expansion are evaluated : @xmath94 @xmath95 in this expression @xmath96 is the bessel function of first order of the first kind and the wave number @xmath97 is expressed in cylindrical coordinates @xmath98 . as time elapses ,",
    "the free particles eigenfunctions acquire a phase factor @xmath99 .",
    "the function at time @xmath91 after the start of the free expansion is found by resumming the eigenfunctions at time @xmath91 : @xmath100 the time evolution for the free expansion of a condensate prepared in a parabolic confinement is derived analogously @xcite . the total measured density generated by the two condensates",
    "is then given by @xmath101 - remember that each condensate function is normalized to the number of particles in the given condensate .",
    "several time frames of the resulting evolution of the density of the expanding condensates are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the frames in figure 3 show a cross - section of the density along the xy - plane .",
    "immediately after the traps are switched off , the density is that of a cylindrical , laguerre - gaussian condensate with a parabolically trapped condensate in the middle . as time goes by , both condensates expand : the parabolically trapped condensate expands radially , and the cylindrical shell of the lg condensate broadens . as the expanding condensates start to overlap the fringe pattern appears .",
    "if the lg condensate does not contain a quantum of superfluid circulation ( i.e. no vortex ) , the interference pattern consists of a series of concentric circles with linearly increasing radius .",
    "if however the lg condensate does contain a vortex , the interference pattern is an archimedean spiral . at higher vorticity",
    ", the number of arms in the archimedean spiral equals the number of vortex quanta in the lg condensate .",
    "figure 3 shows that , as a function of time , the spiral interference pattern rotates around the cylindrical symmetry axis of the trapped condensates , with a frequency of the order of the frequencies characterizing the parabolic approximation to the trapping potentials .",
    "furthermore , as can be seen from figure 3 , the distance between two successive windings of the spiral increases as time increases .",
    "hence , to detect the spiral interference pattern , the density has to be measured on a time scale shorter than that given by the inverse of the characteristic trapping frequencies .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the properties of vortices in a condensate in an optical trap generated by a laser beam in a laguerre - gaussian mode and proposed a method to detect these vortices .",
    "the energy of the vortex state was calculated variationally in a mean - field framework , and a threshold interaction strength was found beyond which there exists a metastability barrier stabilizing the lg vortex state against a transition to a non - vortex state .",
    "both the hydrodynamic instability @xcite and the uniform transition to a non - vortex state @xcite were considered in the investigation of the vortex stability . below the critical interaction strength the metastability barrier vanishes , irrespective of the fact that the present confined geometry allows for the vortex core to be positioned in a region where the condensate is nonzero .",
    "the time evolution under free expansion of a lg condensate was derived , and subsequently used to calculate the interference pattern which arises from the overlap of an expanding lg condensate with an expanding parabolically trapped condensate in its center .",
    "when superfluid circulation is present , the interference pattern consists of an archimedean spiral , clearly distinct from the series of concentric cylindrical fringes which arise in the interference pattern when no vorticity is present .",
    "the observation of such a spiral interference pattern would constitute clear evidence for vorticity in a spin - polarized bose - einstein condensates .",
