    "the experimentally measured ( @xmath11 ) parameters for proton and pion as a function of rapidity are shown as filled circles in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "these data are extracted from the 158@xmath0 gev pb+pb collisions by the na49 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "more details about methods involved in the experimental determination of these parameters can be found in the recent paper  @xcite .",
    "the model calculations ( open circles ) are done within similar impact parameter range and acceptance ( @xmath12 ) cuts .",
    "as one can see , the model calculations are in reasonable agreement with the data for both protons and pions .",
    "the sign of the first fourier moment @xmath4 for pions is opposite to that of protons for both data and model calculations indicating the nuclear shadowing effects in the collision .",
    "an interesting feature in figure  [ fig1 ] is that there seems to be two slopes for the function @xmath13 : at @xmath14 1.5 , the distribution is relatively flatter compared to the region @xmath15 1.5 .",
    "this implies that the physics around the mid - rapidity region is different from that near the projectile ( target ) rapidity region .",
    "one possible interpretation is that near the beam rapidity region , the number of rescatterings is small , therefore the initial geometry leads to a large value of @xmath4 . on the contrary ,",
    "a large number of rescatterings washes out the initial memory and leaves small anisotropy around the mid - rapidity .    as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the second fourier moment @xmath5 is found to be positive for both nucleons and pions at this beam energy .",
    "this implies an enhancement of in - plane emission from the particle source .",
    "more discussions on this point will be presented later in this paper .",
    "since the model predictions are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data , it may be instructive to study system size dependence and the space - time evolution of the anisotropy parameters within the model .",
    "in figure  [ fig2 ] , the model predicted @xmath4 for nucleons and pions as a function of rapidity are shown for 2@xmath0 gev s+s ( @xmath16 fm ) , 2@xmath0 gev ru+ru gev . ]",
    "( @xmath17 fm ) , 2@xmath0 gev pb+pb ( @xmath18 fm ) , 158@xmath0 gev s+s ( @xmath19 fm ) and 158@xmath0 gev pb+pb ( @xmath18 fm ) collisions .",
    "the impact parameter range is chosen such that the maximum value of @xmath4 is achieved for any given colliding system .",
    "it is known from the hydrodynamic calculations that the pressure created at the early stage will lead to sizable values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the pressure is different for different bombarding energies  @xcite . however , from figure  [ fig2 ] and table  [ table : v1v2 ] , one notices that the maximum values of @xmath4 for nucleons are independent of the beam energy for a given colliding system . for a fixed beam energy , the maximum value of @xmath4 depends on the size of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the larger the size , the higher the maximum value of @xmath4 .",
    "this may suggest that the initial geometry , _ i.e. _ the size of the colliding nuclei and impact parameter , determines the strength of @xmath4 near the beam ( target ) rapidity region , providing the elastic scattering amplitude does not vary much within energy range discussed here .",
    "similar trends are also seen for pions even though the @xmath4 for pions has the opposite sign to that of nucleons due to the shadowing effect .",
    "the other interesting feature is that the slope of the @xmath4 curve around the mid - rapidity region depends on beam energy for both nucleons and pions .",
    "the higher the beam energy , the smaller the slope as a function of normalized rapidity . ] . the value of @xmath5 , on the other hand , is maximized around mid - rapidity .",
    "it was suggested that the second fourier moment may carry the information about the early stage of the collision  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath5 signal to the collision dynamics will be discussed in the next section .",
    "now let us explore ( @xmath11 ) of nucleons and pions as a function of freeze - out time for two colliding systems : 2@xmath0 gev au+au and 158@xmath0 gev pb+pb collisions",
    ". in a discussion of the time evolution , a brief remark concerning the nuclear passing time is necessary .",
    "nuclear passing time is the time needed for two incoming nuclei to pass each other and defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the nuclear radius .",
    "passing time sets the scale on which the effects of possible nuclear shadowing , e.g. the interaction of the participating nucleons and produced particles with the spectator matter , are significant . obviously , the passing time depends on the beam energy and on the size of colliding nuclei .",
    "the nuclear passing time @xmath22 , in the nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass frame , for 2@xmath0 gev au+au and 158@xmath0 gev pb+pb collisions are listed in table  [ table : pass ] .",
    "also listed are the nucleon mean freeze - out time @xmath23 from the rqmd calculations .",
    "the ratio of @xmath24 for the low energy collisions is much smaller than that at the high energy , indicating that the nuclear shadowing is relatively more important for lower energy collisions .",
    "the calculated ( @xmath11 ) values , determined in the momentum space , as a function of rapidity in different time windows are shown in figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] for nucleons and pions , respectively . in these figures ,",
    "the open circles are for the lower energy ( 2@xmath0 gev ) and the filled circles for the higher energy ( 158@xmath0 gev ) collisions .",
    "similar distributions calculated at the corresponding passing time ( @xmath25 fm / c for 2@xmath0 gev and @xmath26 fm / c for 158@xmath0 gev collisions ) are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .    for nucleons ,",
    "as one can see in figure  [ fig3 ] ( left column lower 4 plots ) , the strength of @xmath4 is gradually built up as a function of collision time . at the earlier time , @xmath27 fm / c , a well defined negative slope ( around mid - rapidity ) is seen for the low energy collisions while at the high energy the distribution is relatively flat .",
    "this flatness is due to the averaging over the 10 fm / c time period which is much longer than the passing time for the 158@xmath0 gev collisions ( see table  [ table : pass ] ) . in fact",
    ", the negative slope is also present at that energy for @xmath28 as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "this again suggests that the shadowing of the cold nuclear matter is responsible for the observed negative slope at the early stage of the collision . at @xmath29 fm / c ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath4 has been well established for the lower energy collisions .",
    "for the higher energy collisions , the fully established @xmath4 only appears after @xmath30 fm / c .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath4 for pions shows a different trend ( figure 4 left column ) .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath4 are achieved at the early stage of the collision .",
    "as time goes on , the distributions of @xmath4 become flatter .",
    "the fact that the @xmath4 distributions for pions always have a negative slope through the whole collision history suggests the importance of shadowing effect .",
    "however , the shadowing matter is different for pions at different collision stages . at early time ,",
    "@xmath28 , pions ( as well as the participating nucleons ) are shadowed by the cold spectators .",
    "later , after the spectator matter leaves the collision zone , pions are shadowed by the participant nucleons .",
    "this may be the underlying mechanism that leads to the different behavior of @xmath4 for nucleons and pions .",
    "the second fourier coefficient @xmath5 describes an elliptical shape of the azimuthal distribution .",
    "a positive sign of @xmath5 means that the longer axis of the ellipse is oriented in the reaction plane while a negative sign of @xmath5 indicates the longer axis is in the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "this latter effect was called `` squeeze - out '' at bevalac energies  @xcite . in figure  [ fig3 ] and",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] ( right column ) , the @xmath5 distributions are shown as a function of rapidity in different time intervals for nucleons and pions , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that the time averaged values of @xmath5 for nucleons and pions at both beam energies are positive , implying that particles preferentially freeze - out in the reaction plane .",
    "however , at the time scale comparable with nuclear passing time , nucleons and pions demonstrate an out - of - plane emission pattern ( `` squeeze - out '' ) for 2@xmath0 gev collisions ( figure  [ fig5 ] right columns ) which is consistent with the cold nuclear matter shadowing scenario . for high energy collisions , the `` squeeze - out '' effect is absent for both pions and nucleons .",
    "this may be explained by a much shorter nuclear passing time and higher lorentz contraction of the colliding nuclei . according to the rqmd calculations , at about the corresponding passing time",
    ", the average number of collisions suffered by the mid - rapidity nucleons is @xmath31 and @xmath32 for 158@xmath0 gev and 2@xmath0 gev collisions , respectively . in the high energy collisions the rapidity span is about 6 units .",
    "hence , three collisions are just about enough to move a nucleon from projectile rapidity to mid - rapidity . at this energy , neither time nor number of rescatterings",
    "is sufficient to develop an out - of - plane emission .      up to now",
    ", we have discussed the anisotropy parameters ( @xmath33 ) in the momentum space .",
    "it is interesting to look at these parameters in coordinate space in order to understand the space - time evolution of the collisions within the model . to the best of our knowledge",
    "such studies have not been performed before .",
    "the information about source anisotropy may be obtained experimentally by studying two - particle correlation functions  @xcite .    in general , the @xmath4 parameters in the configuration space for both nucleons and pions",
    "( see figure  [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] left columns ) behave differently from those in the momentum space : ( 1 ) the shapes of the @xmath4 distributions are different and the maximum values of @xmath4 ( around the beam and target rapidities ) in the configuration space are much larger than those in the momentum space ; ( 2 ) the @xmath4 of pions has the same sign to that of nucleons ; ( 3 ) the @xmath4 becomes stronger as a function of time , especially for pions .",
    "furthermore , similar to what have been observed in the momentum space , the maximum values of @xmath4 are the same for the two collisions at different beam energies .",
    "this implies that the initial collision geometry plays an important role here .    for the non - zero impact parameter heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the transverse shape of the initial collision zone is an ellipse with its longer axis oriented perpendicular to the reaction plane ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "such an event shape is indeed seen for both collision energies in figure  [ fig6 ] ( right column ) for the time interval @xmath35 fm / c . as time goes on",
    ", rescattering occurs among particles which leads to a more spherical shape of the reaction zone , @xmath36 .",
    "note one would expect a large positive @xmath5 at later times in the case of pressure driven hydroexpansion . for the time integrated distributions ,",
    "some remnants of the initial shape still can be seen for the 2@xmath0 gev collisions while for the higher energy collision the source appears to be isotropic .",
    "based on the rqmd(v2.3 ) model calculations , we studied the anisotropy parameters ( @xmath11 ) as a function of time for different energies and different colliding systems . from a comparison between the model calculations and the recent experiment measurement at the beam energy of 158@xmath0 gev , we find that the model provides a reasonable description of the observed event anisotropy . from the study of energy dependence , we find that the combination of collision geometry and nuclear passing time plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters .",
    "our studies show that the anisotropy parameters extracted in the momentum space are different from the ones extracted in the configuration space . as a function of collision time",
    ", some rather dramatic changes are found for the event anisotropy parameters in both momentum and configuration spaces . at @xmath28 , the pattern of the distributions is strongly influenced by the spectators . at later times ,",
    "a prominent in - plane emission is evident .    *",
