    "the fundamental property of plasmonic excitations is the scaling of the plasma resonance frequency with the square root of the electron density : @xmath0 . to observe plasma resonances at terahertz ( thz ) frequencies , the electron density typically needs to be lowered down to the @xmath1 @xmath2 range , which is achieved in undoped or lightly doped semiconductors .",

    "the micrometer - scale thickness allows the structure to operate in normal - incidence transmission mode , while the surface grating couples the incident thz radiation to the standing spp waves at the insb interface .",
    "this transmission - mode operation sets this structure apart from the recent thz sensing schemes based on wave propagation along the interface@xcite or in a waveguide@xcite .",

    "this thz plasmonic response is highly sensitive to the dielectric environment at the insb interface and propose a sensing modality that takes advantage of the inherent tunability of insb spp properties by temperature and/or doping .",
    "the gold grating and insb layer structure is taken to stretch indefinitely in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions .",

    "the peak position is roughly determined by the plasma frequency , as it sets the width of the low - transmission frequency window of the electron drude response .",
