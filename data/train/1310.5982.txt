    "the authors used the photometric data obtained in the five filters @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , from 0.3 to 1.0 @xmath9 , to obtain values of @xmath10 colors and spectral slopes over the @xmath11 , and @xmath12 reflectance values , computed using the equation :    @xmath13 } , \\label{eq : refl_sdss}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the magnitudes of the object and the sun in a certain filter f , respectively , at the central wavelength of that filter .",
    "the equation is normalized to unity at the central wavelength of filter @xmath16 using @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the @xmath16 magnitudes of the object and the sun , respectively .",
    "values of the solar colors @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are taken from holmberg et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "demeo and carry ( 2013 ) defined strict criteria to reject flawed observation : they eliminated from the sdss - moc4 database objects with a provisional designation , observations with unreliable magnitudes in any of the five filters , values of the @xmath21 filter ( also because of the large errors associated with measurements in this wavelength band ) , and data with flags relevant to moving objects and good photometry .",
    "we refer the reader to sect . 2 of demeo and carry ( 2013 ) for more details on the criteria used to obtain high quality measurements from sdss - moc4 data .",
    "we applied the methods described in demeo and carry ( 2013 ) to the sdss - moc4 dataset .",
    "we refer the reader to fig .  5 in demeo and carry ( 2013 ) , that displays the boundaries , in the plane @xmath22 slope ( measured in the standard units of @xmath23 ) versus @xmath10 colors , used to classify sdss - moc4 data into the taxonomic classes of the bus - demeo taxonomy , converted to sdss - moc4 gri slopes and @xmath10 colors .",
    "we also assigned numbers to the objects that , at the time of the release of sdss - moc4 had only temporary designation and received numbers since then ( a total of 7234 asteroids ) , and , as in demeo and carry ( 2013 ) , we eliminated all objects with @xmath24 , so as to avoid including objects with @xmath25 km , for which the sample is incomplete . also , we included asteroids with @xmath26 with known spectral types from the planetary data system ( neese 2010 ) that are not part of sdss - moc4 .",
    "as a first part of our analysis , we checked if the preliminary analysis of the taxonomy of the hygiea family halo perfomed in paper i still holds . in that article",
    "it was found that the composition of the hygiea family as deduced from principal components obtained from sdss - moc4 photometry was very similar to that of the nearby themis and veritas families , all belonging to cx - complex taxonomies .",
    "therefore , it was somewhat difficult to determine , based only on taxonomical considerations , if a member of the hygiea family halo ( or indeed of the family core itself ) was a fragment of the hygiea parent body or a member of the two other families that dynamically migrated to its present orbital location .",
    "here we applied the more advanced taxonomical scheme of demeo and carry ( 2013 ) to members of the cores of the hygiea , themis , and veritas families computed at a conservative cutoff value of @xmath27 m / s ( or distance ) in the proper element domain , and that also have data in the reduced sdss - moc4 sample .",

    "we believe that our results essentially confirm the preliminary analysis of paper i : most of the members of the hygiea , themis and veritas families belong to the c- and x- type , with a fraction of hygiea and themis family members that can be classified as b - types .",
    "essentially , c- and x- type members of the hygiea family halo that may have come from the themis or veritas families are indistinguishable from halo member that came from the parent body of ( 10 ) hygiea itself .",
    "b - type asteroids in that halo may either come from the hygiea or themis families , but not from the veritas one . eliminating possible themis or veritas families interlopers in the hygiea family halo based on taxonomical considerations only seems , therefore",
    ", somewhat unlikely .    since our focus in this paper is to study the hygiea asteroid family , we selected objects in the sdss - moc4 reduced dataset that were members of the hygiea family core and halo , as obtained at velocities cutoffs of 66 and 76 @xmath29 in paper i. we found a total of 497 observations in the hygiea family core and 695 observations in the hygiea family halo .",
    "a taxonomy is given according to the method described in demeo and carry ( 2013 ) , i.e. , if the @xmath10 and @xmath22 slope is found in the region boundary of a class then the asteroid is assigned to that class . for overlapping classes ,",
    "the taxonomy is assigned in the last class in which the object resides , in the following order : c- , b- , s- , l- , x- , d- , k- , q- , v- , and a - types .",
    "since some asteroids had multiple observations in the sdss - moc4 database , we adopted the demeo and carry ( 2013 ) criteria for classifications in this cases : in case of conflicts , the class with the majority number of classifications is assigned .",
    "if two classes have equal frequency , preference is given to c- , s- , or x - type classifications .",

    "nevertheless , if we exclude this asteroid and other objects unlikely to be members for dynamical reasons that will be explained later on in this section , there is a discrepancy in the position of the barycenter of @xmath30 with respect to the current location of ( 10 ) hygiea . since the family shows an asymmetry , with more objects at larger @xmath1 than at lower @xmath1 , if we put the center of the family at the current orbital location of ( 10 ) hygiea , we believe that a possible reason for this discrepancy could be that the current position of ( 10 ) hygiea is not the one that this asteroid occupied when the family formed . while the yarkovsky drift for a body this size ( @xmath31 , masiero et al .",

    "the discrepancy between the current position of the barycenter of the family ( without ( 10 ) hygiea ) and the current position of ( 10 ) hygiea itself could be a `` fossil '' proof of past dynamical mobility of the orbit of this asteroid caused by close encounters with massive asteroids  .",

    "if the spin - driven reconfiguration leads to a shape of the aggregate that is nearly symmetric , the yorp torques could become negligibly small or even vanish .",
    "this would imply a self - limitation in the evolution of the spin state and the objects would not follow the classical yorp cycle . since our understanding of yorp cycles may be not adequate for modeling the evolution of family members on very long time scales , we preferred not to conduct extensive simulations with symplectic integrators in order to better refine the age estimate of the hygiea family .",
    "whatever the best way to account for all the limitations on our modeling of the long - term effects of yarkovsky and yorp effect could be , here for the first time we showed the importance that close encounters with massive asteroids may also have for the dynamical evolution of the hygiea family , and how they could reduce the estimated age of this family by @xmath3 25% .",
    "this opens new and interesting perspectives for investigating the ageing process of asteroid families , that could be best investigated by studying younger families with relatively massive parent bodies , such as , possibly , the massalia family ( vokrouhlick et al .",
