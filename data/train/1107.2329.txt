    "magnetic spinels are well - known to exhibit geometrical frustration , wherein lattice geometry conflicts with the magnetic interactions that favor a particular minimum energy state",
    ". such frustration can create macroscopic ground state degeneracies , the absence of long range order , and the appearance of novel phenomena and states of matter  @xcite that are of both scientific and technological interest : for example , sulfur - based spinels such as fe@xmath5s@xmath1 ( _ _ b__=cr , sc )  @xcite exhibit novel low - temperature phases such as orbital - liquid or -glass ground states in which frustration prevents long - range orbital order down to _ _ t__=0 ; the chromium - oxide spinels @xmath6o@xmath1 ( _ _ a__=zn , cd , hg ; _ _",
    "b__=cr ) exhibit three - dimensional spin - peierls - like transitions where lattice distortions relieve spin frustration ;  @xcite and the vanadium - oxide spinels @xmath6o@xmath1 ( _ _ a__=zn , cd , mn ; _ _",
    "b__=v ) display complex spin / orbital ordering which are associated with large magnetoelastic and magnetodielectric effects .",
    "@xcite this diversity of low temperature behavior is generally recognized as governed by the delicate interplay between geometrical frustrated exchange interactions , spin - orbital coupling , and applied magnetic field .",
    "@xcite however , there has been little experimental investigation of the microscopic details of this interplay ; moreover , the role that magnetoelastic interactions play in governing low temperature behavior of spinels has not been adequately explored , particularly given the prevalence of structural transitions and magnetoelastic anomalies in these materials .",
    "the binary spinel mn@xmath0o@xmath1 is an ideal model system in which to investigate the complex interplay between structure , competing interactions , spin - orbital - lattice coupling , and applied magnetic field in the spinels ; this is because mn@xmath0o@xmath1in spite of its simpler chemical composition with mn ions at both tetrahedral ( _ _ a__=mn@xmath7 ) and octahedral ( _ _ b__=mn@xmath8 ) sites ( see fig . 1(a))is known to exhibit the rich low - temperature behaviors characteristic of more complex ternary magnetic spinels .",
    "for example , mn@xmath0o@xmath1 shows three different magnetic transitions with complex spin ordering at low temperatures : below @xmath9=43k , the spins in mn@xmath0o@xmath1 exhibit yafet - kittel - type ferrimagnetic ordering , in which the net spin of the octahedrally coordinated mn@xmath8 spins is antiparallel to the [ 110 ] direction of the tetrahedrally coordinated mn@xmath7 spins , with pairs of mn@xmath8 spins canted by @xmath10 from the [ @xmath11 direction ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , where cos@xmath12=0.38 ( 0.33 ) at _ _ t__=4.7k and cos@xmath12=0.45 ( 0.20 ) at _ _ t__=29k for the `` non - doubling '' octahedral ( `` doubling '' octahedral ) site .",
    "@xcite however , below @xmath13=39k , mn@xmath0o@xmath1 develops an incommensurate sinusoidal or spiral spin structure of the mn@xmath8 spins ; and below @xmath2=33k , mn@xmath0o@xmath1 exhibits a commensurate spin structure in which the magnetic unit cell doubles the chemical unit cell .  @xcite recent studies also show that the magnetic transitions in mn@xmath0o@xmath1 are associated with significant changes in the dielectric constant , indicating strong magnetodielectric coupling ;  @xcite indeed , the strong spin - lattice coupling implied by these results is confirmed by observations that the dielectric constant in mn@xmath0o@xmath1 is strongly dependent upon both the magnitude and direction of an applied magnetic field .",
    "@xcite the dielectric changes in mn@xmath0o@xmath1 are also accompanied by strain changes ,  @xcite suggesting that the complex magnetic ordering and magnetodielectric / magnetoelastic behaviors in mn@xmath0o@xmath1 are associated with magneto - structural changes induced by magnetic ordering or magnetic field . however , due to a dearth of microscopic measurements , the microscopic details associated with the low - temperature behaviors in mn@xmath0o@xmath1particularly the microscopic mechanism by which spin - phonon coupling mediates the magnetodielectric behavior in mn@xmath0o@xmath1remain uncertain .",

    "raman scattering is particularly effective for studying the complex phases of materials such as mn@xmath0o@xmath1 because ( i ) it conveys important information regarding the microscopic structural and magnetic phases of materials , by providing detailed energy , symmetry , and lifetime information about the electronic , magnetic , and lattice degrees - of - freedom in a material ; and it can be readily performed under the extreme conditions needed for exploring low temperature , high magnetic field , and high pressure phase changes .",

    "these raman and x - ray studies allow us to elucidate the microscopic structural changes that underlie the low - temperature magnetic ordering and magnetodielectric behavior and to uncover new magnetostructural phase regimes in which magnetodielectric and other novel phenomena are observed . among the important results of our studies : ( i )",

    "this result reveals the mechanism by which mn@xmath0o@xmath1 relieves geometrical frustration and magnetically orders at low temperatures .",
    "( ii ) field - dependent studies show that the onset and nature of this structural transition depends on both the magnitude and the direction of the magnetic field , elucidating the microscopic origins of the remarkable magneto dielectric and elastic properties of mn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "of particular interest is the observation of a field - tuned quantum phase transition to a tetragonal spin - disordered phase for magnetic fields applied transverse to the ferrimagnetic easy - axis direction , i.e. , for * * h**@xmath3[@xmath4 , which we argue arises from a field - tuned degeneracy of magnetostructural states in mn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "( iii ) pressure - dependent raman measurements show that the magnetic easy axis direction in mn@xmath0o@xmath1 can be controlled  and the ferrimagnetic transition temperature increased  with applied pressure .",
    "( iv ) finally , combined pressure- and magnetic - field - tuned raman measurements reveal a rich magnetostructural phase diagram  including a pressure- and field - induced magnetically frustrated tetragonal phase in the _ ph _ phase diagram  that can be generated in mn@xmath0o@xmath1 with applied pressure and magnetic field . overall",
