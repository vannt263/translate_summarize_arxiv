    "axially symmetric focusing of wave fields occurs in various areas of science , since physical systems often possess an intrinsic rotational symmetry .",
    "in particular , the electromagnetic field enhancement by small spherical particles is important in many situations .",
    "spheres have minimal surface energy for a given volume and thus are naturally formed as a result of phase separation , for example as aerosols or colloids .",
    "applications of colloidal microspheres in photonic crystals and photonic crystal slabs led to an explosion of the experimental and theoretical studies of their optical properties.@xcite the majority of these investigations concentrate on their collective properties in a periodic arrangement .",
    "single microspheres are used as high quality optical resonators and as agents that allow controlled and highly localized wavelength - dependent field enhancement for non - linear optical studies and in resonance spectroscopy.@xcite here , the emphasis is placed on the eigenmode analysis and the distribution of the field within the sphere or in the immediate vicinity of its surface .    lately",
    ", it was demonstrated that self - assembling arrays of transparent colloidal microspheres can be employed for high - throughput laser - assisted micro- and nano - structuring of materials.@xcite similar effects were observed in experiments on dry laser cleaning , where such particles are used as controlled contaminants.@xcite this necessitates better understanding of the focusing of light by microspheres with diameters of several wavelengths .",
    "only few rigorous results are available for the intermediate range of sphere sizes and distances from the particle .",
    "the majority of analytical approaches either deal with the properties of the eigenmodes , or refer to the integral characteristics and/or to the far field behavior.@xcite mie resonances were analyzed on the basis of advanced geometrical optics@xcite and detailed numerical calculations for transparent spheres of several wavelengths in size were performed in connection with the use of laser tweezers in biology@xcite and for needs of aerosol science.@xcite    in this work we develop a theoretical description for an arbitrary non - paraxial strongly aberrated axially symmetric focusing and apply it to the case of dielectric microspheres .",
    "our emphasis is on the fine structure of the field distribution in the exterior of the sphere up to the focal region , which can be used to control and improve the concentration of energy .",
    "strong spherical aberration makes the focusing non - trivial .",
    "usually , the exact solution is obtained using the mie theory,@xcite which does not give much of a physical insight as it requires the summation of a large number of terms in a multipole expansion even for moderate sphere sizes . at the same time , the main focusing properties of transparent dielectric microspheres originate rather from the picture of geometrical optics .",
    "one might think that in the lowest approximation a small sphere acts as an ideal lens .",
    "however , in the range of sizes we are interested in , this picture does not even provide a description which is qualitatively correct .",
    "also classical formulas for weak spherical aberration @xcite do not yield useful results for the field behind a sphere : they predict that the maximum intensity is kept unchanged and its position does not depend on the wavelength .",
    "our approach , following the method of uniform caustic asymptotics,@xcite is based on the canonical integral for the cuspoid ray topology of strong spherical aberration . though this bessoid integral",
    " a member of the hierarchy of diffraction catastrophes@xcite  appears naturally in the paraxial approximation , it can be used to describe arbitrary axially symmetric strong spherical aberration by appropriate coordinate and amplitude transformations . for angularly dependent vectorial amplitudes",
    "the formalism uses higher - order bessoid integrals .",
    "the bessoid integral is the axially symmetric generalization of the pearcey integral,@xcite which plays an important role in many short wavelength phenomena.@xcite therefore , the present approach can be applied in various areas of physics where axially symmetric focusing is of importance , e.g. , acoustics , semiclassical quantum mechanics , radio wave propagation and scattering theory .",

    "this is the case for the pearcey integral .",
    "the bessoid integral corresponds to a structurally unstable caustic , because an infinitely small perturbation will destroy the radial symmetry and the axis will not be a caustic zone any longer .",
    "it is , however , stable on the class of axially symmetric wavefronts .",
    "the cusp is the envelope of the family of rays .",
    "the latter correspond to the _ points of stationary phase _ in the bessoid integral , i.e. , those points where the two first partial derivatives with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the phase @xmath30 in ( [ eq bessoid ] ) vanish . inside the cusp , for @xmath31 , three rays ( tangents to the cusp ) arrive at each point of observation @xmath32 , and outside , for @xmath33 , there is only one real ray ( figure [ fig rays ] ) .",

    "these rays originate from the circle @xmath40 on the aperture .",
    "they are all in phase and produce a high intensity along the axis ( compare the two pictures in figure [ fig bessoid ] ) .",
    "the oscillations occur due to interference with the ray propagating along the @xmath2-axis .",
    "one can also directly observe that the bessoid integral has the topology of spherical aberration as the maximum of intensity does not lie in the geometrical focus @xmath41 but is spherically aberrated to a negative value of @xmath29 , i.e. , towards the aperture .      off the caustic  away from the cusp _ and the focal line _  the bessoid integral ( [ eq bessoid ] ) can be approximated by the method of stationary phase . as the integrand in ( [ eq bessoid ] ) is highly oscillatory , the only significant contributions to the integral come from those regions where the phase is stationary:@xcite@xmath42 where the summation runs over all real rays , i.e. , @xmath43 ( lit region ) or @xmath44 ( shadow ) .",

    "have transparent physical meaning .",
    "indeed , near the axis the largest contribution to the field comes from the converging cone of non - paraxial rays ( similar to ray 1 ) that intersect the axis at an angle @xmath131 .",
    "if the angle @xmath131 is constant and all rays have the same intensity , the result is the bessel beam.@xcite such beams have a propagation constant along the @xmath2-direction equal to the @xmath2-component of the wavevector of the plane waves which form them and correspondingly the argument of the bessel function ( cylindrical analog of a plane wave ) is equal to @xmath132 . as the angle @xmath131 gradually changes for the spherically aberrated wave , so does the argument of the bessel function .",
    "additionally , there exists the axial ray 2 , which is not present in the canonical bessel beam ( though it often appears in real experimental situations ) .",
    "the interference of this beam with the converging ray cone results in the intensity oscillations along the axis ( figure [ fig bessoid ] , bottom ) .",
    "clearly , these oscillations are largely due to the phase difference @xmath133 . at large negative @xmath29 in ( [ eq near axis ] ) erfc@xmath134i@xmath135\\rightarrow 2\\,[1\\!-\\!\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,z}\\exp($]i@xmath136 $ ] , and the oscillating behavior is governed by the phase of the exponent , which is equal to @xmath137 .",
    "this clarifies the origin of expression ( [ eq near axis z ] ) , as it is @xmath138 entering the final formulas .",
    "in particular , the global maximum is expected on axis at the first constructive interference of the axial and the non - paraxial rays . because @xmath139 in this region , the two terms of the erfc expansion are first in phase when the phase difference is @xmath140 .",
    "the geometrical meaning of this result is that rays 1 and 3 are shifted by @xmath70 as they touch the cusp .",
    "in addition , they acquire a further shift of @xmath70 when crossing the focal line .",
    "but exactly _ on the axis _ only half of this delay has occurred yet , which yields the @xmath141 difference",
    ". the numerical maximum of the bessoid intensity ( absolute square ) occurs at @xmath142 and hence this yields the condition@xmath143 which is close to @xmath144 .",
    "the width of the focal line caustic , @xmath145 , is defined by the first zero @xmath146 of the bessel function in ( [ eq near axis ] ) .",
    "hence , with ( [ eq bessel argument]),@xmath147 in the geometrical optics picture the first minimum occurs when rays 1 and 3 interfere destructively , i.e. , when their phase difference becomes @xmath148 .",
    "this results in @xmath149 , where the term @xmath150 takes into account the caustic phase shift of ray 1 : @xmath151 .",
    "note , that this is smaller than the airy spot for the same aperture angle@xcite and large angles @xmath131 are indeed realized , e.g. , in the case of the sphere studied below .",
    "finally , we present an expression for the field ( [ eq ansatz ] ) on the axis . the equations for the amplitudes ( [ eq a , ar , az ] )",

    "it details the contribution of the cone of non - paraxial rays , represented by ray 1 ( first term ) , and the axial ray 2 ( second term ) to the overall structure of the field .",
    "note that in the general case not only the angle @xmath131 , but also the amplitude of the converging cone may vary along @xmath2 ( @xmath29 ) , thus slowly modifying the properties of the bessel beam in the axial region .",
    "this enters ( [ eq on axis field ] ) via amplitude transformations and is manifested by the presence of the initial ray amplitudes in both terms .",
    "inside the cusp on the axis ( @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) both @xmath155 and the ratio @xmath156 remain finite as the divergence of the paraxial ray 2 is non - singular , while the sagittal divergence @xmath157 of the cone of non - paraxial rays 1 is proportional to @xmath122 . due to the bessoid matching procedure",
    "the singularity of the converging cone is removed by the compensating factor @xmath158 . along the axis the last term in ( [ eq on axis field ] ) partly cancels with the second term in the parentheses of the first term . as a result ,",
    "the on axis field behavior up to the focus is dominated by a single term proportional to the bessoid integral @xmath25 , which justifies the maximum condition ( [ eq phase difference axis ] ) discussed above .",
    "often  especially in _ vectorial _ problems  there exists axial symmetry with respect to the wavefronts , ray phases and generalized divergences , but not with respect to the amplitudes . in this case ,",
