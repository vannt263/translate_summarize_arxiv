    "the ground state of a quantum dot is a many electron singlet @xmath3 , for sufficiently low magnetic fields .",
    "this can change at higher magnetic fields .",
    "we assume that the system is in a regime of magnetic field so that the lowest lying states are ordered as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the relevant energy scales used in the following analysis are given by the energy difference between the triplet state ( we assume small zeeman splitting ) and the ground state @xmath4 , and exchange splitting @xmath5 between the first excited singlet and the triplet .",
    "it is possible to inject an electron into an excited state of the dot .",
    "if this excited state is a triplet , the system may get stuck there since a spin - flip is required to cause transitions to the ground state .",
    "the @xmath6-point of the conduction band in @xmath0 is mainly composed of @xmath7-orbitals , so that the hyperfine interaction can be described by the contact interaction hamiltonian @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) denote the spin and position the @xmath13-th electron ( @xmath14-th nuclei ) .",
    "this coupling flips the electron spin and simultaneously lowers / raises the @xmath15-component of a nuclear spin , which mixes spin states and provides possibility for the relaxation .    but the hyperfine interaction alone does not guarantee that transitions between the above - described states occurs , since the nuclear spin flip can not relax the excessive initial state energy .",
    "( the energy associated with a nuclear spin is the nuclear zeeman , @xmath16 , energy which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the electron zeeman energy and the energies related to the orbital degree of freedom . ) for free electrons , the change in energy accompanying a spin flip caused by the hyperfine scattering is compensated by an appropriate change in its kinetic energy . in the case of a quantum dot , or any system with discrete a energy spectrum , this mechanism is not available and no hyperfine induced transitions will occur because the energy released by the quantum can not be absorbed .",
    "therefore , the spin relaxation process in a dot also requires taking into account the electron coupling to the lattice vibrations . the excess energy from the quantum dot can be emitted in the form of a phonon . since the ` bare ' electron - phonon interaction , @xmath17 does not contain any spin operators and thus does not couple directly different spin states , one has to employ second order perturbation theory which results in transitions via virtual states .",
    "the amplitude of such a transition between the triplet state @xmath18 and the ground state @xmath19 is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy of the emitted phonon and @xmath22 is the energy changed by raising / lowering a nuclear spin .",
    "it is natural to assume that the exchange splitting is smaller than the single - particle level splitting , so that the dominating contribution to the amplitude @xmath23 comes from the term describing the virtual state @xmath24 , due to a small denominator .",
    "all other term can be ignored and the approximate amplitude takes the form @xmath25 the justification for this assumption is that we aim at obtaining estimates of the rates , and including higher states would not affect the order of magnitude , even if the exchange splitting is substantial . note that the phonon and nuclear state are not explicitly written in eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude ] ) .    the transition rate from @xmath26 to @xmath3 is given by fermi s golden rule @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the final phonon and nuclear states respectively and @xmath30 and @xmath31 stand for the initial and final energies . inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude ] ) into ( [ eq : goldenrule ] ) and averaging over initial nuclear states with probability @xmath32 , we obtain an approximate equation for the nucleus mediated transition rate @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the non - spin - flip phonon rate as a function of the relaxed energy @xmath35 .",
    "we will approximate the many - body orbital wavefunctions by symmetric , @xmath36 , and antisymmetric , @xmath37 ,  slater determinants corresponding to the singlet and triplet states respectively .",
    "it is not obvious _ a priori _ why this approximation is applicable , since the coulomb interaction in few electron quantum dots can be quite strong @xcite .",
    "the exact energy levels are very different from those obtained by simply adding the single particle energies .",
    "however the wavefunction will not drastically change and especially the matrix elements calculated using slater determinants are comparable to the ones obtained by using exact ones .",
    "the singlet and triplet wavefunctions can be decomposed into orbital and spin parts : @xmath38 and the hyperfine contribution to the rate becomes @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the wavefunctions of the lowest energy states and @xmath41 contains the nuclear correlation functions @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the symmetric part of the nuclear correlation tensor , @xmath44 is the totally anti - symmetric tensor and the @xmath45 s are the coefficients in the triplet state expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion ] ) .",
    "we assume that nuclei are identical and non - interacting , which gives @xmath46 for an isotropic nuclear system .",
    "let us now introduce the length scales @xmath47 and @xmath48 which are the spatial extent of the electron wavefunction in the lateral direction and the dot thickness respectively .",
    "let @xmath49 denote concentration of nuclei with non - zero spin .",
    "the effective number of nuclei contained within the quantum dot is @xmath50 in @xmath0 @xmath51 and the sum over the nuclei in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prefactor1 ] ) can be replaced by @xmath52 and we define the dimensionless quantity @xmath53 to relate the hyperfine constant @xmath54 ( which has dimension energy@xmath55volume ) to more convenient parameter we note that the splitting of spin up and spin down states at maximum nuclear polarization is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the nuclear spin . thus , the hyperfine mediated transition rate is @xmath58 note that the rate is inversely proportional to the number of nuclei @xmath59 in the quantum dot and depends on the inverse square of @xmath60 , which are both possible to vary in experiments@xcite . in particular , the singlet - triplet splitting of excited states of a dot can be brought down to zero value using magnetic field parallel to the 2d plane of the heterostructure , which would accelerate the relaxation process .",
    "the nuclear correlation functions in @xmath61 may also be manipulated by optical orientation of the nuclear system@xcite .",
    "we now consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratehyperfine ] ) for a specific quantum dot structure .",
    "it is assumed that the lateral confinement is parabolic and that the total potential can be split into a lateral and transverse part . for vertical dots",
    "the approximate transverse wavefunction is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the thickness of the quantum well , i.e.  the dot thickness .",
    "the wavefunctions in the lateral direction are the darwin - fock solutions @xmath64 with radial quantum number @xmath65 and angular momentum @xmath66 .",
    "the single particle states corresponding to @xmath67 and @xmath68 are used to construct the slater determinant for a two - electron quantum dot . in the case of these states the factor @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaint ] ) is then @xmath70 for a vertical dot and @xmath71 for a lateral one .",
    "one property of the darwin - fock solution is the relation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the effective confining frequency and @xmath74 the cyclotron frequency . inserting this and eq .",
    "( [ eq : neff ] ) into ( [ eq : ratehyperfine ] ) the rate for parabolic quantum dots becomes @xmath75    spin relaxation due to spin orbit related mechanisms in @xmath0 quantum dots were investigated by khaetskii and nazarov in refs .   and .",
    "we will summarize their results here for comparison with our hyperfine - phonon mechanism . in ref , it has been found that the dominating scattering mechanism is due to the absence of inversion symmetry .",
    "there are three parameters related to this mechanism ,      here , @xmath77 is determined by the transverse confinement and band structure parameters and @xmath78 . for vertical dots of thickness @xmath79 nm , then @xmath80mev , but one should be cautious when considering a different thicknesses , since @xmath81 , so the rates are sensitive to variations in @xmath48 .",
    "the transition rates in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ratehyperfine ] ) and ( [ eq : ratea])-([eq : ratec ] ) are all proportional to the phonon rate @xmath34 evaluated for the same energy difference @xmath82 .",
    "it is thus sufficient to compare the only the proportionality coefficients .",
    "let us now consider for which confining energies the different rates are comparable . at zero magnetic field",
    "@xmath83 at @xmath84mev .",
    "the estimated confining energies of vertical quantum dots used in experiment are in the range @xmath85mev@xcite . for those dots @xmath86 due to the very different dependence on the confinement , @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    ". doing the same for @xmath89 and @xmath90 we obtain that those rates are equal at @xmath91mev .",
    "the numerical values used for the hyperfine rate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratehyperfine ] ) are the following : @xmath92mev@xcite , @xmath93mev@xcite and a @xmath94 nm .",
    "thus , for @xmath95 t and the previously cited experimental values for the confining energy the dominant transition rate is eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratec ] ) .",
    "an application of a magnetic field to the dot may result in two effects . the rate @xmath101 becomes larger than @xmath102 for magnetic fields around @xmath103 t ( @xmath104mev ) to @xmath105 t ( @xmath97mev ) .",
    "more importantly , the exchange splitting @xmath106 can vanish in some cases and the hyperfine rate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratehyperfine ] ) will dominate .",
    "it is also worth noting that in this limit the approximation used in obtaining eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude ] ) becomes very good .",
    "since the rates considered here are all linear in the phonon rate the divergence of @xmath107 at the singlet - triplet transition does not affect the ratio of the rates .",
    "the above estimates were focused on vertical dots . to obtain the corresponding results for lateral dots the value of @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratehyperfinedf ] ) should be used .    in summary , we have calculated the nucleus mediated spin - flip transition rate in @xmath0 quantum dots .",
    "the comparison of our results to those previously obtained for spin - orbit scattering mechanism indicates that the rates we obtained here are relatively low , due to the discrete spectrum , so that we believe that hyperfine interaction would not cause problems for spin - coherent manipulation with @xmath0 quantum dots .",
    "nevertheless , the hyperfine rate , which was found to be lower than the spin - orbit rates at small magnetic field , may diverge and become dominant at certain values of magnetic field corresponding to the resonance between triplet and singlet excited states in the dot .",
