    "the formation of the first stars marked a fundamental transition in the history of the universe .",
    "they initiated the transformation of the homogeneous intergalactic medium ( igm ) to one filled with the rich structure we observe today .",
    "ending the so - called ` cosmic dark ages ' , when the universe contained no visible light , they lit up the universe at redshifts @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "they formed at the center of dark matter ( dm ) ` minihalos ' with virial masses @xmath3 , which are the smallest building blocks in the hierarchy of galaxy formation .",
    "these objects accrete the pure hydrogen and helium gas forged in the big bang , and after continued cooling and contraction form a stellar embryo that begins to accrete from the surrounding gas cloud .",
    "since the virial temperature of minihalos is not high enough to activate atomic hydrogen cooling , the gas can only cool via molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath4 ) .",
    "the importance of h@xmath4 for the cooling of low - mass gas clumps that condense out of the expanding universe was recognized in the late 1960 s @xcite .",
    "later on , simplified one - zone models accounted for the dynamics of collapsing gas clouds next to the radiative cooling of the gas @xcite .",
    "the first one - dimensional calculations of the simultaneous collapse of dm and gas were carried out in the context of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm @xcite , while three - dimensional simulations had to await improvements in numerical simulation techniques in the late 1990s @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of these studies is that the minimum temperature to which the gas can cool via h@xmath4 lines is more than an order of magnitude higher than in present - day star formation regions , resulting in a greatly increased jeans mass .",
    "since the accretion rate is directly related to the jeans mass , population  iii stars are expected to have masses of the order of @xmath5 . following the introduction of this  standard model  of primordial star formation , recent",
    "work has focused on refining this picture .",
    "in particular , the influence of fragmentation , protostellar interactions , radiation , and magnetic fields were initially neglected .",
    "these may have a substantial effect on the collapse of the gas . in this review ,",
    "i summarize the progress made on these topics since the advent of the first three - dimensional simulations of primordial star formation .    despite the complications brought about by these processes ,",
    "it is likely that population  iii stars were much more massive than present - day stars .",
    "they are therefore strong emitters of ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation , which heats the igm and begins the process of reionization @xcite .",
    "their radiation also dissociates h@xmath4 on cosmological scales and may suppress star formation until halos massive enough to activate atomic hydrogen cooling assemble @xcite .",
    "next to radiative feedback , the supernova ( sn ) explosions of massive population  iii stars exert mechanical as well as chemical feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "due to the intricate nature of feedback , the formation of the first galaxies in so - called ` atomic cooling halos ' is much more complicated than the formation of the first stars in minihalos @xcite .",
    "fully self - consistent simulations that predict the properties of the first galaxies are not yet available .",
    "nevertheless , recent work has shown that supersonic turbulence is one of the key factors governing the properties of the first galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radiative and chemical feedback from stars in progenitor halos influence their formation as well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the degree of sophistication of first galaxy simulations has continued to increase , with the most recent studies including star formation and feedback recipes that rival those of present - day galaxy formation simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the organization of this review is as follows . in section  [ sec_sm ] , i give a brief introduction to structure formation in the high - redshift universe , followed by a description of the collapse of gas in minihalos .",
    "i then review the influence of fragmentation on the accretion phase , the evolution of the nascent protostellar system , and the effects of protostellar radiation on the initial mass function ( imf ) of the first stars ( section  [ sec_nsm ] ) . in section  [ sec_ap",
    "] , i discuss additional physics that may affect the formation of the first stars , including hydrogen deuteride ( hd ) cooling , magnetic fields , cosmic rays , streaming velocities , dm annihilation , and alternative cosmologies . finally , in section  [ sec_fg ] i discuss the radiative , mechanical and chemical feedback exerted by population  iii stars , next to the progress made with respect to the formation of the first galaxies .",
    "i focus on theoretical work , with a particular emphasis on numerical simulations , but briefly mention neglected processes and empirical signatures in section  [ sec_es ] .",
    "the summary is presented in section  [ sec_con ] .",
    "all distances are quoted in proper units , unless noted otherwise .",
    "finally , a reference to related reviews is in order .",
    "a general description of structure formation in the early universe may be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the high - redshift igm is discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and the effects of the relative velocity offset between dm and baryons may be found in @xcite .",
    "the formation of the first stars in minihalos is reviewed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , while the properties of the first galaxies are described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "less focused reviews of star formation at high redshifts may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , feedback by population  iii is summarized in @xcite .",
    "on the largest scales , the universe appears nearly uniform and isotropic .",
    "however , the presence of stars and galaxies indicates that below a certain scale the universe must have begun to deviate from its uniformity .",
    "it is believed that these structures grew from infinitesimally small perturbations seeded by quantum fluctuations in the very early universe . within variants of the cdm model , where the mass density of the universe is dominated by dm ,",
    "the matter overdensity @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the local mass density and @xmath8 the mean density of the universe , grows in proportion to the scale factor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes redshift .",
    "once the overdensity becomes of order unity , the associated region decouples from the expanding background universe and collapses under its own gravity .",
    "the collapse may occurs simultaneously in one , two , or three dimensions .",
    "structures that collapse in one dimension are termed ` sheets ' , the collapse of two sheets results in a ` filament ' , and dm ` halos ' form at the intersection of filaments . the likelihood of formation decreases with increasing dimensionality , such that there are many more sheets than halos .",
    "however , halos provide the deepest potential wells and are therefore the sites of star and galaxy formation .      one of the most important characteristics of the cdm paradigm is the hierarchical , ` bottom - up ' nature of collapse .",
    "increasingly massive halos form via accretion and merging of low - mass halos .",
    "the smallest collapse scale is set by the free - streaming length , which is about @xmath11 if dm consists of a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ; * ? ? ?",
    "following the collapse of a dm halo , it achieves virial equilibrium within a few dynamical times , with the virial density given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the balance between gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy allows a virial velocity to be defined , and is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant , @xmath16 the virial mass , and @xmath17 the virial radius of the halo .",
    "the latter is related to the mass of the halo via @xmath18 .",
    "halos with virial masses up to @xmath19 are commonly referred to as minihalos , since they are massive enough to cool and host star formation .",
    "a @xmath20@xmath21 peak typically forms at @xmath22 , and their virial radius may be conveniently written as : @xmath23 a number of studies have systematically investigated the properties of minihalos , finding that they are usually denser and more clustered than their high - mass counterparts @xcite .",
    "the dm sets the gravitational potential for the gas , which virializes within the halo and heats to the virial temperature @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath26 the mass of the hydrogen atom , and @xmath27 boltzmann s constant . in terms of a typical minihalo",
    ", the virial temperature may be written as : @xmath28 in contrast to the pressure - less dm , a minimum scale exists below which the gas can not collapse .",
    "this scale is approximately given by the jeans length , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the sound speed of the gas , and @xmath31 the free - fall time .",
    "the corresponding jeans mass is given by @xmath32 , and may be derived from the density and temperature of the igm . since the gas temperature is coupled to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by compton scattering at @xmath33 , the cosmological jeans mass initially remains constant at @xmath34 @xcite . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the gas expands adiabatically , and the jeans mass is given by @xmath35^{3/2}$ ] .",
    "this is many orders of magnitude larger than the minimum dm halo mass .",
    "more careful calculations that use perturbation theory to compute the growth of density fluctuations define a filtering mass below which the gas content in a halo is significantly suppressed with respect to the cosmic mean ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these calculations find that the filtering mass remains nearly constant at a few times @xmath36 at @xmath37 . even though this is the minimum mass of a halo at which the gas can contract by a substantial amount , it is not yet a sufficient criterion for star formation .      for the collapse of the gas to continue beyond the formation of a hydrostatic object",
    ", it must be able to radiate away its thermal energy .",
    "one of the most efficient coolants in primordial gas is collisional excitation cooling of atomic hydrogen , also termed ly-@xmath38 cooling .",
    "this coolant is most effective at temperatures @xmath39 , where the first excited state of atomic hydrogen begins to be populated .",
    "however , halos with masses greater than the filtering mass , but below approximately @xmath40 , which corresponds to a virial temperature of @xmath39 at @xmath41 , must rely on another coolant . @xcite and @xcite realized that molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath4 ) may be such a coolant .",
    "the rotational and vibrational states of h@xmath4 in the electronic ground state are excited by collisions with other particles , which decay and allow the gas to cool .",
    "the most important transitions operate in the temperature range @xmath42 . at higher temperatures , ly-@xmath38",
    "cooling becomes dominant . despite its importance at high redshifts ,",
    "the h@xmath4 molecule is not a particularly efficient coolant .",
    "since the hydrogen molecule is symmetric , it does not have a permanent electric dipole moment , resulting in correspondingly lower transition probabilities .",
    "in addition , the existence of ortho and para states for hydrogen rules out the lowest energy transition @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the rotational quantum number .",
    "the least energetic transition with a non - negligible probability of occurring is the @xmath45 transition , which corresponds to a temperature of @xmath46 . in practice ,",
    "the maxwellian tail of the velocity distribution allows the gas to cool to @xmath47 .",
    "the absence of a dipole moment in the h@xmath4 molecule also rules out its simplest formation channel : the direct association of two hydrogen atoms .",
    "the excess energy of the collision can not be radiated away quickly enough , and so the intermediate system decays again @xcite .",
    "for this reason , alternative formation channels have been considered @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of primordial star formation , the most important formation channel is via the intermediary reaction of radiative association of free electrons with neutral hydrogen atoms @xcite : @xmath48 associative detachment of the h@xmath49 atoms with neutral hydrogen atoms then results in the formation of h@xmath4 : @xmath50 one of the most important parameters that governs the amount of h@xmath4 that can be formed is the electron abundance .",
    "it decreases from its relic abundance by recombining with ionized hydrogen : @xmath51 most of the h@xmath4 therefore forms within a recombination time .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the asymptotic h@xmath4 abundance depends primarily on the ratio of the h@xmath49 formation to the recombination rate constant @xcite .",
    "if the recombination rate is significantly smaller than the radiative association rate , more electrons remain to form h@xmath49 . for typical values of the rate equations ,",
    "the asymptotic h@xmath4 abundance scales approximately as @xmath52 , and for @xmath53 lies in the range of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the somewhat counterintuitive result that a more massive halo with a higher virial temperature forms more h@xmath4 , which allows the gas to cool more efficiently .",
    "the h@xmath4 abundance necessary to cool the gas and facilitate its collapse to high densities may be obtained by comparing the cooling time with the hubble time .",
    "the latter estimates the time scale on which the virial temperature of a halo changes significantly @xcite .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that for a virial temperature of about @xmath55 , enough h@xmath4 is produced to cool the gas @xcite .",
    "this value does not depend strongly on redshift , such that the minimum halo mass required for efficient cooling may be obtained from equation  [ eq_tvir ] : @xmath56 this is typically an order of magnitude higher the filtering mass , showing that not all halos that are massive enough to allow the gas to collapse are also massive enough to facilitate cooling and star formation .",
    "it is important to note that the above derivation of the cooling mass is only approximately valid , since in reality the gas is constantly heated by minor mergers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even though the first stars typically formed at @xmath22 , they are not the very first stars in the observable universe . instead ,",
    "these are believed to have formed at @xmath57 @xcite .      during the initial stages of the collapse",
    ", the level populations of h@xmath4 are not yet populated according to local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) , and the cooling rate scales as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei .",
    "once enough h@xmath4 has formed , a runaway process ensues in which cooling allows the central gas cloud to contract , which results in even more cooling .",
    "this collapse phase ends when collisions between h@xmath4 molecules and other species become so frequent that the ro - vibrational levels of h@xmath4 are populated according to lte . in this case , the collisional excitation rate is approximately balanced by the collisional de - excitation rate , such that the cooling rate scales approximately as @xmath60 .",
    "the cooling time thus remains slightly larger than the free - fall time , and the collapse rate decreases .",
    "the transition from non - lte to lte occurs approximately at a density of @xmath61 , where the gas has cooled to @xmath47 .",
    "this phase in the collapse of the gas has been termed the ` loitering phase ' , since the collapse momentarily slows while the central gas cloud continues to accrete mass @xcite .",
    "the jeans mass at this characteristic density and temperature is @xmath62 .",
    "once this mass has been accreted , the cloud collapses under its own gravity .",
    "since the h@xmath4 cooling rate is a strong function of temperature , the cooling time @xmath63 in the lte regime adjusts to the free - fall time . equating these two time scales implies @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the power - law exponent of the cooling function .",
    "writing this in the form @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the effective equation of state , one finds @xmath68 .",
    "the temperature therefore increases very slowly with increasing density for @xmath69 . in a near - isothermal",
    ", jeans - unstable cloud the accretion rate is approximately given by @xmath70 .",
    "since the temperature of present - day star formation regions is about @xmath71 , this simple physical argument implies that population  iii stars were typically @xmath72 times more massive than population  i / ii stars .",
    "following the nearly isothermal collapse of the cloud to densities @xmath73 , three - body reactions begin to convert the mostly atomic gas to molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the most important formation reaction is @xmath74 with a smaller contribution from reactions involving h@xmath4 molecules and helium atoms .",
    "the rapidly increasing h@xmath4 fraction results in a similarly rapid increase in the h@xmath4 line cooling rate .",
    "however , since each formation process is accompanied by the release of the binding energy of the h@xmath4 molecule of @xmath75 , the cooling is offset by chemical heating .",
    "the net effect is a mild drop in temperature as the h@xmath4 fraction approaches unity .",
    "the resulting thermal instability of the gas caused by a chemical transition corresponds to the chemothermal instability envisaged by @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that it may trigger gravitational instability and fragmentation @xcite . indeed , in the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , a subset of the clouds fragmented into two distinct clumps , although the strength of the instability in @xcite was likely overestimated due to the approximate treatment of the optically thick h@xmath4 line cooling rate ( see section  [ sec_line ] ) .",
    "the further evolution of the clumps can not be reliably extrapolated from the state of the cloud at the instant they fragment , but it appears that in some halos a wide binary system may form .    until recently , one of the major caveats in the chemical evolution of primordial gas clouds was the large uncertainty in the three - body formation rate coefficient . at @xmath55 ,",
    "the published rates differ by up to two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the influence of the three - body formation rate on the properties of primordial gas clouds was investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found that radially averaged quantities as well as the morphologies of the clouds varied significantly between simulations with different rates , and are comparable to the differences for different initial conditions .",
    "this uncertainty may have recently been alleviated by the quantum - mechanical calculations of @xcite .",
    "they found that the three - body formation rate coefficient at the relevant temperatures is approximately two times lower than that of the commonly employed @xcite rate .",
    "another important transition occurs at densities @xmath76 , where the gas becomes optically thick to h@xmath4 line emission . for each of the @xmath77 ro - vibrational transitions that are important at the relevant densities and temperatures , thermal doppler broadening",
    "dominates the frequency dependence of the emitted radiation .",
    "the cross section for each line shows a similar frequency dependence , but in addition depends on the relative velocity along the line of sight . until recently",
    ", this complicated radiative transfer problem has only been solved accurately in one - dimensional calculations @xcite .",
    "these studies found that the wings of the lines allow the radiation to escape more efficiently than in the case of a grey opacity . in a spherically symmetric calculation",
    ", @xcite and @xcite found that the escape fraction , which is defined as the probability of a photon to escape from the cloud , may be fit by @xmath78 $ ] , where @xmath79 .",
    "this fit has also been used in three - dimensional simulations @xcite , due to the high computational cost of multi - frequency line transfer calculations in three dimensions .",
    "the accuracy of this treatment depends on how spherically symmetric the cloud is , and on how well the radially averaged profiles agree with those found in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the functional form of the fit depends on the detailed chemical , thermal , and dynamical evolution of the cloud , which in turns depends on the various rate equations employed @xcite .",
    "according to the simulations of @xcite , the requirement of spherical symmetry is relatively well satisfied , while simulations that use the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method tend to find a more pronounced disk component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the moving - mesh simulations of @xcite found clouds with a morphology similar to those of @xcite .",
    "only a few showed substantial deviations from spherical symmetry . in cases where these deviations exist , @xcite found that a simple density - dependent fitting function does not yield accurate results .",
    "another method to estimate the escape fraction is the sobolev method @xcite . in a cloud with a uniform velocity gradient , the escape fraction is given by @xmath80/\\tau$ ] , where @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the sobolev length , and @xmath38 the absorption coefficient .",
    "the sobolev length is given by @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the thermal velocity , and @xmath85 the velocity gradient .",
    "the sobolev length estimates the scale on which a line is doppler - shifted out of resonance .",
    "this method was first used in the simulations of @xcite , where the average escape fraction along the three principal axes of the computational domain was computed . in subsequent studies ,",
    "this was replaced by the average velocity gradient , and the sobolev length was limited to be smaller than the jeans length for very small velocity gradients @xcite . in general , the sobolev method is only valid if the sobolev length is small compared to the scales on which the properties of the gas change significantly .",
    "this is not the case in primordial gas clouds , where transonic turbulence is present and the variation in the radial velocity is comparable to the sound speed of the gas .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite found that the escape fractions obtained with the different methods disagree only by a factor of a few , while @xcite and @xcite found agreement within a factor of two .",
    "however , the results of @xcite were obtained using different hydrodynamical schemes for the two methods , such that it is unclear to what extent the discrepancy is related to the treatment of the optically thick cooling rate .",
    "the first self - consistent treatment of h@xmath4 line transfer in a three dimensional simulation was presented in @xcite .",
    "this study used a multi - line , multi - frequency ray - tracing scheme to follow the propagation of h@xmath4 line radiation through the computational domain ( see figure  [ fig_ray ] ) .",
    "the spherically averaged escape fraction agreed relatively well with the fit of @xcite , while the sobolev method yielded escape fractions that were up to an order of magnitude higher .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the fact that the sobolev approximation is not valid in primordial gas clouds . as a result , the gas temperature in @xcite is systematically higher than in previous studies that used the sobolev method , and the cooling instability found in @xcite also disappears .",
    "the reduced temperature results in a somewhat reduced h@xmath4 fraction at densities @xmath86 , which is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "an effect that is not captured in the previous approximate methods is the diffusion of radiation through the cloud , which tends to smooth out density perturbations . as a result ,",
    "the central gas cloud becomes increasingly spherically symmetric as it collapses to higher densities .",
    "the fitting function also does not account for changes in the geometry of the cloud , which are expected once the collapse stalls and a disk forms .",
    "it neglects the complex dependence of the escape fraction on the properties of the gas , such as the density , velocity , and temperature profiles , and thus an implicit dependence on the various chemical and thermal rate equations employed .",
    "line photons in the central @xmath87 of a minihalo , shown for various treatments of the optically thick h@xmath4 line cooling rate .",
    "the top row shows the outcome for the density - dependent fit of @xcite , the middle row for the sobolov method , and the bottom row for the self - consistent radiative transfer calculation of @xcite .",
    "the sobolev method greatly overestimates the escape fraction at high densities , whereas the fitting function shows better agreement with the ray - tracing solution , even though the gas fragments in this particular simulation .",
    "adapted from @xcite.,width=453 ]    unfortunately , it is not yet computationally feasible to continue the radiation hydrodynamics simulations of @xcite beyond the initial collapse of the gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is in part due to the large number of opacity calculations necessary for an accurate integration , which is given by @xmath88 , where the individual factors denote the number of cells , the number of rays sent from each cell , the number of lines , and the number of frequency bins ( the extra factor of @xmath89 accounts for the average number of cells an individual ray must traverse ) . in the simulation of @xcite ,",
    "these parameters were chosen to achieve an overall accuracy of @xmath90 . for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , nearly @xmath95 opacity calculations per time step were carried out .",
    "a single ray - tracing step therefore took about @xmath96 on @xmath97 modern computing cores . to evolve the gas from @xmath98 to @xmath86 , where the gas becomes optically thick to h@xmath4 line emission , about @xmath99 ray - tracing steps had to be performed .",
    "this corresponds to a total runtime of about one month and a computational cost of nearly one million cpu hours .",
    "the simulation was run using a hybrid mpi / open - mp parallelization scheme on the sandy - bridge cores of the supercomputer _ stampede _ at the texas advanced supercomputer ( tacc ) . among many other optimizations ,",
    "the opacity calculation exploited the intel avx instruction set , which allows up to eight single - precision operations to be performed simultaneously .",
    "another challenge of the radiative transfer calculation is the amount of memory required to store the energy associated with the individual rays . in single precision , @xmath100 bytes",
    "must be reserved , which corresponds to @xmath101 per core for @xmath97 cores .",
    "each global communication step therefore requires nearly the entire memory to be exchanged between mpi tasks , which accounts for approximately @xmath102 of the total computational cost .",
    "another problem is the significant imbalance in the number of rays stored on the tasks .",
    "since the domain decomposition is optimized for hydrodynamical simulations instead of radiative transfer simulations , a significant imbalance accumulates as the rays are traversed .",
    "typically , this amounts to another factor of two , and leads to a similar reduction in performance .",
    "it is therefore not yet beneficial to tailor the scheme for graphics processing units ( gpu s ) or co - processors .",
    "an alternative method was recently introduced by @xcite .",
    "this study used the treecol algorithm of @xcite to determine the total column density of h@xmath4 molecules in various directions around each cell .",
    "the method accounts for relative velocities in a simplified manner , and computes the average photon escape fraction from the optical depth of the individual transitions .",
    "the computational cost is only about five times higher than in a simulation without radiative transfer , and allowed @xcite to follow the build - up and fragmentation of the disk around the primary protostar . during the initial collapse",
    ", the escape fraction agrees relatively well with that of @xcite , while in the later stages of the collapse the disk allows the radiation to escape more easily than previous approximate methods would imply .",
    "this reduces the thermal stability of the gas , and promotes fragmentation .      for densities @xmath103 , collision - induced emission and absorption become important @xcite .",
    "these processes are characterized by two hydrogen molecules approaching each other and forming a ` super - molecule ' with a dipole moment induced by van der waals forces .",
    "the resulting super - molecule can emit or absorb radiation via dipole transitions , and has higher transition probabilities than the quadrupole transitions of isolated h@xmath4 molecules . as opposed to h@xmath4 line emission , where the line width is small compared to the separation of the individual lines , the short lifetime of the super - molecule results in line widths large enough that they merge into a continuum .",
    "@xcite found that collision - induced emission continues to cool the gas even after it has become optically thick to h@xmath4 line emission .",

    "the gas becomes optically thick to collision - induced emission at densities @xmath106 .",
    "this rapid transition compared to h@xmath4 line emission is due to the absence of absorption wings , which increases the optical depth of the gas .",
    "@xcite also found that a chemothermal instability similar in nature to the one induced by three - body h@xmath4 formation may be triggered .",
    "however , the growth rate is longer than the free - fall time , such that it most likely does not result in sub - fragmentation of the cloud ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the results achieved with these treatments can differ substantially for asymmetric cloud configurations , but agree relatively well with one - dimensional calculations for clouds that are approximately spherically symmetric @xcite .",
    "the last process that is able to cool the gas is collisional dissociation of h@xmath4 .",
    "it acts as a thermostat by converting the compressional energy of the gas into energy that is used for the dissociation of h@xmath4 , which has a binding energy of @xmath107 . the temperature and density at which h@xmath4 begins to dissociate depends on the ratio of the three - body formation rate to the collisional dissociation rate . in @xcite ,",
    "this occurs already at temperatures @xmath108 at a density of @xmath109 , while other studies find this to occur at significantly higher densities @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is likely related to differences in the reaction rates and the treatment of the optically thick h@xmath4 line cooling rate @xcite .    from a computational standpoint , obtaining a self - consistent h@xmath4 fraction at these densities is computationally expensive , since the three - body formation rate scales with the cube of the density .",
