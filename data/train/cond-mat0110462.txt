    "immediately after the discovered of high-@xmath0 superconductors@xcite high pressure experiments have played an important role in improving and understanding these materials . however , despite of tremendous efforts , the superconducting interaction in high-@xmath0 oxides@xcite remains one of the greatest puzzle in condensed matter physics .",
    "more recently , several experiments@xcite indicate that the appearance of a pseudogap , that is , a discrete structure of the energy spectrum at a temperature @xmath1 above the superconducting phase transition at @xmath0 is an important property which needs to be taken into account in the quest for the solution of this problem@xcite . however , one difficulty is that different techniques , depending on the particular experimental probe used , may yield different values of pseudogap temperature @xmath1 for the same type of sample .",
    "there are mounting evidences that the pseudogap and the charge inhomogeneities , possibly in a stripe morphology@xcite , are different but closely related phenomena .",
    "this is mainly because the @xmath1 has its maximum value for underdoped compounds@xcite which possess the larger charge inhomogeneities@xcite .",
    "furthermore @xmath1 decreases with the average doping level and probably becomes equal to @xmath0 for overdoped compounds which are those with more homogeneous charge distributions@xcite .",
    "moreover , a local meissner state , which usually appears only in the superconducting phase , has been detected far above @xmath0 for an underdoped sample@xcite .",
    "such inhomogeneous diamagnetic domains develop near@xcite @xmath1 for @xmath3 thin films and grow continuously as the temperature decreases towards @xmath0 . near @xmath0 , the domains appear to percolate through the sample .    based on these experimental findings ,",
    "some of us have developed a new approach to deal with this phenomenology@xcite .",
    "the main ideas are the following ; compounds of a given family , with an average charge density @xmath4 have inhomogeneous charge distributions which are less homogeneous for underdoped and more homogeneous for overdoped samples .",
    "these distributions contain a hole - rich and a hole - poor partition which mimic the stripes .",
    "these charge inhomogeneities in the hole - rich regions produce local clusters with spatially dependent superconducting gaps @xmath5 due to local cooper pairing and superconducting temperatures @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath1 is the largest of all the @xmath6 , that is , the largest local superconducting temperature in a given compound . since the clusters have different charge densities , some are metallic and some are insulating . as the temperature decreases below the @xmath1 ,",
    "part of the metallic clusters become superconducting and , eventually a temperature is reached where the different superconducting regions can percolate , exactly as clearly demonstrated by the fine diamagnetic domains measured by iguchi et al@xcite . at or below the percolation temperature , the system can hold a dissipationless supercurrent and this temperature is normally identified as superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the temperature @xmath0 is assumed to be the percolating transition for the supercurrent and it is not the usual superconducting transition related with the appearance of a superconducting gap .",
    "this scenario resembles the proposal of ovchinnikov et al@xcite and its implications are discussed in ref.3 .    according to these ideas , experiments which produce changes on @xmath1",
    "are able to provide direct information on the superconducting interaction .",
    "one such type of experiment is the isotopic substitution of @xmath7 by @xmath8 in the slightly underdoped @xmath9 which leads to an increase in @xmath1 from @xmath10k to @xmath11k and negligible effect on @xmath0@xcite . despite the anomalous increase of @xmath1 for the heavier isotope ,",
    "this result indicated that , at least for this sample , electron - phonon induced effects are likely to be present in the mechanism related to @xmath1 and somehow , are less important on @xmath0 .",
    "the prime objective of this work is to study the nature of the pseudogap and to achieve this goal we analyze resistivity measurements under low applied hydrostatic pressures .",
    "the measurements were performed on two different optimally doped @xmath2 samples in temperatures range from 120k ( below @xmath0 ) up to room temperatures .",
    "the resistivity for underdoped and optimally doped high-@xmath0 oxides has a linear behavior up to very high temperatures but at @xmath1 , it downturns and falls faster as temperature is decreasing@xcite .",
    "we have recently reported pressure effects on @xmath0 on this compound@xcite , but our aim here is to study simultaneous pressure effects on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we show that @xmath1 increases at larger rate than @xmath0 in the pressure range of our experiment .",
    "this result provides a novel interpretation for the well known _ pressure intrinsic effect _ and we argue that the data are consistent with a superconducting interaction mediated by phonons .",
    "the resistivity measurement were performed using an hydrostatic pressure cell within a cooper cylinder piston .",
    "an external pressure was applied to the cylinder and it was transmitted through a n - pentane - isoamyl alcohol mixture ( 1:1 ) to the sample .",
    "the sample was mounted on a teflon sample holder , and in order to provide a good thermal contact with the temperature sensor , the sample holder was thermally coupled to the cube pressure cell .",
    "the pressure was monitored with a manganin resistance situated inside the cell .",
    "further details of this experimental set - up can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "four electric contacts with low electric resistance were deposited onto the sample by using silver paint . after stabilizing the pressure , the temperature was increase recording the resistance on the sample .",
    "this procedure was repeated at several pressures making @xmath12 curves .",
    "the temperature was recorded and stabilized using a `` lake - shore-340 '' temperature controller .",
    "the resistance measurements were performed using an ac - bridge resistance `` linear research inc , model lr-700 '' .",
    "the @xmath12 curves were measured within the linear - response regime with an applied current to the sample of @xmath13a .",
    "we have measured the resistivity for two optimally doped @xmath2 samples ( a and b ) as function of temperature for four different applied pressures up to @xmath14gpa .",
    "the samples were made under the same conditions .",
    "as an example of our results , the temperature dependent resistivity data for sample a at zero pressure and @xmath15kbar is shown in fig.1 .",
    "panel 1a shows the data for @xmath16 and 1b shows a plot of @xmath17 against t , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively , the intercept and the linear coefficient of the high temperature linear part of the @xmath16 curve .",
    "the @xmath1 temperature was taken at the point where the experimental resistance curve starts to downturn from the high - temperature linear behavior . to determine @xmath1 ,",
    "we have used the same criterion of ito et al@xcite which is shown in fig.1b . at each applied pressure ,",
    "@xmath1 was taken as the temperature at which the curve starts to downturns from its base - value as demonstrated in panels 1b and 1d .",
    "it should be noted that others criteria for @xmath1 leaded to practically the same experimental findings , meaning that the @xmath1 increase with the pressure is independent of its experimental criterion .",
    "( where @xmath20 has the largest value ) is shown in the insert of panels a ) and c ) .",
    "the criterion for @xmath1 is shown in panels b ) and d).,width=321 ]    the critical temperature @xmath0 was defined as the temperature for which the @xmath20 has the largest value@xcite as shown in panels 1a and 1c .",
    "we have measured an experimental @xmath21 rate of 0.15 k / kbar for sample a and 0.26k / kbar for sample b , which are typical values for these multilayer compounds@xcite . in order to verified these derivatives we have performed magnetic susceptibility measurements on both samples .",
    "the increase of @xmath0 with the applied pressure is in the range of similar compounds which we have previously been reported@xcite .",
    "while sample a has @xmath22k and @xmath23k at ambient pressure , sample b has @xmath24k and @xmath1 just above @xmath25k .",
    "since both the present samples and the ones previously studied were made under the same condition , we do not have an explanation for these differences .",
    "nevertheless it is a common fact that different samples of the same compound with the same @xmath0 , may exhibit large differences in their @xmath1 value@xcite .",
    "the theory of pressure effects@xcite identify two contributions to the changes on @xmath0 : a pressure induce charge transfer ( pict ) from the charge reservoirs to the @xmath26 planes and an intrinsic term , of unknown origin , which is more clearly detected mainly at , or near to , the optimally doped compounds . in the case of optimal doping and low pressure ,",
    "i.e. , less than 5gpa , there is a negligible pict@xcite and @xmath0 is a linear function of the pressure .",
    "this linear behavior is therefore attributed entirely to the intrinsic contribution@xcite and it is believed to be due to the effect of the pressure on the superconducting interaction@xcite . it can be regarded as due to an intrinsic increase on the superconducting interaction , what makes the cooper pairs more tightly bound and also increases the superconducting gap .",
    "thus , in order to determine whether the pseudogap is also affected by an external pressure and if the intrinsic effect is also present at the pseudogap temperatures , we plotted in fig.2a and 2b the @xmath0 and @xmath1 values obtained from the resistivity data . while sample a has @xmath27k at ambient pressure , sample b hat @xmath28k . through these figures",
    "we can see for the first time , the original and most important result of our work , that @xmath1 and @xmath0 increase under the applied pressure in a linear way , but @xmath29 is around 3 - 5 times larger than @xmath21 . for sample",
    "a we get @xmath30k / kbar and @xmath31k / kbar for sample b. this behavior lead us to the main conclusion of this work , namely , the pressure induced intrinsic term modifying @xmath0 is much stronger on the pairing formation temperature @xmath1 .     and @xmath1 as function of the applied pressure for both samples . data in panel",
    "a ) is for sample b and b ) for sample b. notice that both samples have linear variations pressure variations for @xmath0 and @xmath1.,width=321 ]    our experiment reveals a larger pressure effect on @xmath1 than on @xmath0 .",
    "we have already mentioned the results of temprano et al@xcite with different isotope effect on these temperatures .",
    "similarly harris et al@xcite have demonstrated with arpes measurements that the zero temperature superconducting gap @xmath32 does not correlates with @xmath0 .",
    "however , according to the percolation scenario for high-@xmath0 oxides@xcite , @xmath32 correlates with the onset of superconducting gap @xmath1 and not with @xmath0 ( see fig.3 of ref.3 ) .",
    "we have mentioned that our most important finding is the larger linear increase on @xmath1 than on @xmath0 and such behavior is possibly the consequence of the intrinsic pressure effect on the superconducting interaction@xcite .",
    "the presence of a constant intrinsic term on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 is an indirect evidence of the increase of the superconducting interaction .",
    "however , we will argue that this result could either be explained under the assumption of a phonon mediated mechanism or by a non - equivalent two layer hole density . in a typical bcs superconductor , either in weak@xcite or strong@xcite coupling regime",
    ", @xmath0 is proportional to the debye frequency @xmath33 and to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the density of state and @xmath36 the phonon mediated pairing potential amplitude .",
    "these two terms yield opposite contributions when the sample is under an external applied pressure .",
    "the applied pressure increases @xmath37 in any solid and also broaden the density of states , thereby reducing @xmath35 which is the dominant factor in a typical bcs superconductor and produces an overall decrease in @xmath0 .",
    "now , assuming the same type of dependence on high-@xmath0 superconductors , the effect on @xmath35 is minimized in a high-@xmath0 sample with a large charge inhomogeneities distribution because such inhomogeneities produce also a broadening of the density of states , as clearly demonstrated by ovchinnikov et al@xcite .",
    "therefore the net low pressure effect on an optimally doped cuprate is to increase @xmath37 which yields a proportional linear increase on all @xmath6 in the sample and , consequently , on @xmath1 , assuming , according ref.3 , that @xmath1 is the pair formation temperature . since at the low pressures",
    "all values of @xmath6 throughout the sample increase proportionally to @xmath37 , the percolation temperature @xmath0 will also increases .",
    "this provides a physical interpretation to the linear behavior of both @xmath1 and @xmath0 and to the well known pressure intrinsic effect which , despite of being widely detected@xcite , has not received any previous microscopic interpretation .    another interesting possibility to explain the increase of @xmath0 and @xmath1 under pressure , uses the idea of a competition between two hole dependent effects@xcite : pairing formation which decreases with doping and the system stiffness to phase fluctuations which controls long - range phase coherence and increases with doping . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well known that three layer compounds , like our @xmath2 samples a and b , must have differences in the doped hole concentration in the different layers@xcite .",
    "therefore one layer may have a hole concentration with favor pairing and the other may favor phase coherence . the pressure induced charge transfer ( pict ) between different layers may lead to an optimal dependent distribution of doped holes which increases the layer superfluid stiffness , producing an enhancement in @xmath0 , concomitantly with an increase in the pairing scale , and therefore an enhancement in @xmath1@xcite .",
    "we have reported here for the first time simultaneously hydrostatic pressure effects on the pseudogap temperature @xmath1 and on @xmath0 of an optimally doped high-@xmath0 superconductor .",
    "we have measured a larger linear increase on @xmath1 than on @xmath0 under applied pressures up to @xmath15gpa .",
    "these data show that the intrinsic effect on @xmath0 could be a consequence of the larger effect on the pair formation temperature @xmath1 .",
    "there are several implications from the pressure induced increase of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the increase on @xmath1 indicates the presence of the superconducting mechanism what supports the local cooper pairing scenario due to the charge inhomogeneities in the planes of @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , the linear behavior of @xmath1 and @xmath0 under pressure is consistent with a mechanism leading to the formation of superconductivity mediated by phonons .",
    "this is in agreement with the very large isotope effect measured on @xmath1 by temprano et al@xcite and very recent arpes measurements@xcite .",
    "these experiments together yield a strong support for the lattice effects on the mechanism for high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "another interesting implication , also consequence of a phonon mediated superconducting interaction and the charge inhomogeneities , is a novel physical interpretation for the well known pressure intrinsic effect on @xmath1 as due to the pressure change of the debye frequency .",
    "however the enhancement of @xmath1 and @xmath0 may also be due to the pict between non - equivalent layers of our sample .",
    "we are presently pursuing our resistivity under pressure experiment with samples having different oxygen content .",
    "we believe that for underdoped compounds , @xmath1 and @xmath0 will behave in similar way as reported above . for more homogeneous overdoped samples we expect the broadening of @xmath35 under applied pressure to be much less important and therefore @xmath1 and @xmath0 may not increase . at higher pressures , for instance above 5gpa , and different doping level , we expected the pict to be important leading to different pressure variations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
