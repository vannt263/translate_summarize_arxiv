    "in the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath6 violation in the quark sector is explained through the complex cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "one relation due the unitarity of the ckm matrix , @xmath7 , is represented graphically in the complex plane as the unitarity triangle , shown in figure  [ ut ] .",
    "the goal of the  and belle experiments is to test the sm explanation of @xmath6 violation in overconstraining the unitarity triangle , by measuring its sides and its three angles @xmath0 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( also called @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 respectively ) .",
    "the angle @xmath12 brings into play the two elements of the ckm matrix which are non real at lowest order : @xmath13 , involved in decays proceeding via a @xmath14 to @xmath15 transtion , whose phase is @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , involved in @xmath18 mixing , whose phase is @xmath19 .",
    "so @xmath20 can be measured from @xmath6 violating asymmetries in the interference between mixing and decay in charmless decays of the neutral @xmath21 mesons , such as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "a @xmath26 meson can decay into a @xmath6 eigenstate @xmath27 either directly or after having oscillated to a @xmath28 meson which then decays to @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitudes associated to the two processes are respectively @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 accounts for @xmath18 mixing .",
    "the resulting @xmath6 violation asymmetry as a function of the proper time difference @xmath32 can be expressed as :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the mass difference between the two neutral @xmath21 mass eigenstates .",
    "the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 are functions of the ratio of the amplitudes with and without mixing @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) measures direct @xmath6 violation while @xmath40 measures @xmath6 violation in the interference between decay and mixing .    in the simple case of a charmless @xmath26 decay involving only the @xmath14 to @xmath15 tree diagram amplitude , with weak phase @xmath9 , we have @xmath41 , resulting in @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ". a time - dependent analysis of the @xmath6 asymmetry in this mode would give a direct measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "however other diagrams are involved in charmless decays and in particular the one loop gluonic penguin diagrams . as the dominant gluonic penguin diagram does not carry the same weak phase as the tree diagram , the extraction of @xmath0 becomes more complex .",
    "@xmath38 is no longer equal to 0 and @xmath44 does not any more measure @xmath0 but an effective value @xmath45 .",
    "the isospin analysis  @xcite , based on @xmath46 symmetry , allows the extraction of the true value of @xmath0 .",
    "it can be applied both to the @xmath47 and @xmath48 modes and uses all the @xmath21 decay modes to @xmath49 ( @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) to determine the difference @xmath52 .",
    "tree and penguin contributions to @xmath53 decays are summarized in table  [ treepeng ] . since the tree amplitude in the @xmath54 decays is color suppressed , the branching ratio of these modes is expected to be small .",
    "also the isospin conservation rules exclude gluonic penguin transitions for @xmath55 final states .",
    ".diagrams contributing to @xmath53 decays . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ kstrho ]    an alternative approach to measure @xmath0 is to use flavor su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite , constraining the penguin contribution in @xmath23 with the longitudinal part of the su(3 ) partner mode : the pure penguin @xmath56 channel . the latter mode has been measured by belle using @xmath57 @xmath58 pairs  @xcite and using @xmath59 @xmath58 pairs  @xcite .",
    "this method has three unknowns : the ratio of penguin over tree amplitudes , the relative phase between penguin and tree amplitudes and @xmath0 .",

    "an isospin analysis would not constrain sufficiently the many amplitudes of the @xmath21 decays to @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and their charge conjugates .",
    "a better approach @xcite is based on the time - dependent analysis of the @xmath63 decay over the dalitz plot , illustrated in figure  [ dalitz_rhopi ] , using the isospin symmetry as an additional constraint . as this @xmath72 decay",
