    "the theory of quantum transport in nano - scale devices has evolved rapidly over the past decade , as advances in experimental techniques have made it possible to probe transport properties ( at different temperatures ) down to the single - molecule scale .",
    "furthermore simultaneous measurement of charge and heat transport through single molecules is now also possible @xcite .",
    "the development of accurate theoretical methods for the description of quantum transport at the single - molecule level is essential for continued progress in a number of areas including molecular electronics , spintronics , and thermoelectrics .",
    "one of the longstanding problems of quantum charge transport is the establishment of a theoretical framework which allows for quantitatively accurate predictions of conductance from first principles .",
    "the need for methods going beyond the standard approach based on density functional theory combined with landauer - like elastic scattering @xcite has been clear for a number of years .",
    "it is only recently that more advanced methods to treat electronic interaction have appeared , for example those based on the many - body @xmath0 approximation @xcite .",
    "alternative frameworks to deal with the steady - state or time - dependent transport are given by many - body perturbation theory based on the non - equilibrium ( ne ) green s function ( gf ) formalism : in these approaches , the interactions and ( initial ) correlations are taken into account by using conserving approximations for the many - body self - energy @xcite .",
    "other kinds of interactions , e.g. electron - vibron coupling , also play an important role in single - molecule quantum transport .",
    "inelastic tunneling spectroscopy constitutes an important basis for spectroscopy of molecular junctions , yielding insight into the vibrational modes and ultimately the atomic structure of the junction @xcite .",
    "there have been many theoretical investigations focusing on the effect of electron - vibron coupling in molecular and atomic scale wires @xcite .",
    "in all these studies , the interactions have always been considered to be present in the central region ( i.e. the molecule ) only , and the latter is connected to two non - interacting terminals .",
    "interactions are also assumed not to cross at the contracts between the central region and the leads .",
    "when electronic interactions are present throughout the system , as within density - functional theory calculations , they are treated at the mean - field level and do not allow for any inelastic scattering events .",
    "however , there are good reasons to believe that such approximations are only valid in a very limited number of practical cases .",
    "the interactions , in principle , exist throughout the entire system .    in a recent paper we derived a general expression for the current in nano - scale junctions with interaction present everywhere in the system @xcite .",
    "with such a formalism , we can calculate the transport properties in those systems where the interaction is present everywhere .",
    "the importance of extended interaction in nano - scale devices has also been addressed , for electron - electron interaction , in recently developed approaches such as refs .  [ ] .    in the present paper , we also consider interactions existing beyond the central region .",
    "we apply our recently developed formalism @xcite for fully interacting systems to a specific model of a single - molecule nanojunction .",
    "we focuss on a model system in the presence of electron - vibron interaction within the molecule and between the molecule and one of the leads .",
    "we show how the interaction crossing at one interface of the molecular nanojunctions affects the transport properties by renormalising the coupling at the interface in a bias - dependent manner .",
    "we also study the relationship between the non - equilibrium  charge susceptibility @xcite and the dynamical conductance for the present model of interaction crossing at the contacts .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : transport ] , we briefly recall the main result of our current expression for fully interacting systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : interac ] , we present the model hamiltonian for the system which include two kinds of electron - vibron interaction , an holstein - like hamiltonian combined with a su - schrieffer - heeger - like hamiltonian . in this section , we also describe how the corresponding self - energies are calculated and the implications of such approximations on the current expression at the left and right interfaces . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , we show that our approximations are fully consistent with the constraint of current conservation .",
    "then the effects of the static non - equilibrium ( i.e. energy - independent but bias - dependent ) renormalisation of the coupling at the contact on both the current and the dynamical conductance are studied for a wide range of parameters .",
    "we also show that the ne charge susceptibility is still related to the dynamical conductance even in the presence of crossing interaction at the contact .",

    "( b ) off - resonant regime @xmath191 and @xmath189 , ( c ) quasi - resonant regime @xmath193 and @xmath194 . @xmath185 and @xmath187 present features at the same applied bias .",
    "note the negative contribution to @xmath195 around @xmath196 .",
    "see main text for a complete discussion .",
    "the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps050].,width=272 ]    finally , one should note the negative contribution to @xmath185 in panel ( c ) of figure [ fig : nechigv ] .",
    "such a behaviour originates from the properties of @xmath195 and not from the approximation used to calculate the crossing interaction @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are always two contributions to @xmath195 , one is positive and corresponds to electron fluctuation and the other is negative and corresponds to hole fluctuation . by electron ( hole )",
    "fluctuations , we mean the variation of the occupancy ( versus applied bias ) of electronic resonances located nominally above ( below ) the fermi level at equilibrium ( or at small bias ) .",
    "therefore , for the off - resonant transport regime with @xmath197 , the features in @xmath185 corresponds to positive peaks ( as shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) in figure [ fig : nechigv ] and in the different figures of ref .",
    "[ ] ) . for the off - resonant regime with @xmath198 , one would get negative peaks in @xmath185 .",
    "for the intermediate and quasi - resonant transport regime , one obtains both positive and negative contributions in @xmath185 as shown in panel ( c ) of figure [ fig : nechigv ] .",
    "the most peculiar case corresponds to a fully electron - hole symmetric system , i.e. the spectral function @xmath199 is fully symmetric around the equilibrium fermi level and for any applied bias @xmath17 with @xmath200 . in that case",
    ", one can easily show that @xmath201 is actually given by @xmath202 for symmetry reasons .",
    "hence @xmath203 is independent of the applied bias for conserving approximations for the self - energies , and consequently @xmath204 .",
    "such a behaviour can also be interpreted with the previous picture : for a fully electron - hole symmetric system , any contributions from electron fluctuation is exactly cancelled out by the opposite contribution from hole fluctuation , and @xmath185 is flat and equal to zero for each bias @xcite .",
    "we have studied the transport properties through a two - terminal nanoscale device with interactions present not only in the central region but also with interaction crossing at the interface between the left lead and the central region . to calculate the current for such an fully interacting system",
    ", we have used our recently developed quantum transport formula @xcite based on the negf formalism . as a first practical application ,",
    "we have considered a prototypical single - molecule nanojunction with electron - vibron interaction . in terms of the electron density matrix ,",
    "the interaction is diagonal in the central region for the first vibron mode and off - diagonal between the central region and the left electrode for the second vibron mode .",
    "the interaction self - energies are calculated in a self - consistent manner using the lowest order hartree - fock - like diagram in the central region and the hartree - like diagram for the crossing interaction .",
    "our calculations were performed for different transport regimes ranging from the far off - resonance to the quasi - resonant regime , and for a wide range of parameter values .",
    "they shown that , for this model , we obtain a non - equilibrium ( i.e. bias dependent ) static ( i.e. energy independent ) renormalisation of the nominal hopping matrix element between the left electrode and the central region .",
    "the renormalisation is such that the amplitude of the current is reduced in comparison with the current values obtained when the interaction is only present in the central region .",
    "such a result could provide an partial explanation for the fact in conventional density - functional based calculations , the values of the current are always much larger than in the corresponding experiments , since no non - equilibrium renormalisation of the contacts is taken into account in those calculations .",
    "however , even though it provides the right trends , the decrease in the current obtained by ne renormalisation of the coupling to the leads is not as important as the effects obtained from a proper calculation of the band - gap and band - alignment in realistic molecular system @xcite .",
    "the ne static renormalisation of the contact is highly non - linear and non - monotonic in function of the applied bias , and the larger effects occur at applied bias corresponding to resonance peaks in the dynamical conductance .",
    "the conductance is also affected by the ne renormalisation of the contact , showing asymmetric broadening around the resonance peaks and some slight displacement of the peaks at large bias in function of the coupling strengh @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , we have also shown that , even in the presence of crossing interactions , the relationship between the ne charge susceptibility and dynamical conductance @xcite still holds for the different transport regimes considered here .",
    "extensions of the present study are now considered .",
    "one route is to develop more accurate ne renormalisation by considering , for example , a quasi - particle approach within a dynamical mean - field - like treatement of the crossing interaction self - energy @xcite .",
    "another route is to go beyond the hartree approximation for the crossing interaction self - energy using other many - body diagrams @xcite .",
    "this would lead to dynamical ne renormalisation of the contact involving inelastic scattering processes .",
    "finally , it should be noted that for the model system we considered here , one could also solve the problem by using more standard approaches ( typically the original meir and wingreen approach ) by extending the size of the central region to include all the interaction .",
    "the results then obtained should be strictly equivalent to our calculations .",
    "we have already commented in detail on this point ( in a formal and theoretical point of view ) in refs .",
    "[ ] . however our approach offers a more intuitive physical interpretation of the results , i.e. renormalisation of the contact ( in the present case in a static ne mean - field scheme ) .",
    "using an extended central region will not provide an easy physical interpretation of the results ; and as a matter of principle , it will not always be possible to increase at will the size of the central region , more especially when one considers future application of the method to much large molecular system with much more complex coupling to the leads ."
