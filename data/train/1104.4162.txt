    "the flat nuclear modification factor seen at rhic energies disappear . that flatness was the results of a nice interplay between nuclear shadowing and multiscattering with the jet quenching .",
    "as the flat nuclear modification factor disappear at lhc energy , then the simple geometrical explanation of nuclear modification factor also becomes obsolete .",
    "this statement is one of the strongest consequences of the alice data .",
    "the other consequence is the negligible role of shadowing at lhc energies .",
    "our analysis focused on induced jet energy loss and nuclear shadowing .",
    "the introduction of elastic energy loss beyond the radiative energy loss may change the results , but the basic conclusion on the presence of a weak nuclear shadowing will not be modified .",
    "furthermore , these calculations clearly indicate the perturbative qcd region , where the parton model including jet energy loss is applicable to explain the measured hadron suppression pattern in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this region is @xmath65 . under this momentum value",
    "the behaviour of the nuclear modification factor decouples from the pqcd description .",
    "this means that very probably quark coalescence  @xcite dominates hadron production in the intermediate momentum region under 6 - 7 gev / c , both at rhic and lhc energies , although many questions connected to hadron - hadron correlations remained open .    the new alice data at @xmath66  @xcite induced an extended discussion and many papers appeared after the publication of these data ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "final conclusion can be drawn after the new @xmath4 data collected at @xmath67 will be analysed and direct comparison to data with small statistical and systematical errors can be performed .",
    "we have investigated jet energy loss at rhic and lhc energies . comparing the experimental data on nuclear modification factor measured in central au+au and pb+pb collisions",
    ", we can claim the presence of a weak nuclear shadowing effect to able to accommodate a larger jet energy loss at lhc energies with respect to the proper opacity values at rhic energies . in case of weak nuclear modification factor",
    "the jet energy loss can explain the measured data .",
    "these calculations should be repeated when experimental data on reference @xmath4-collisions will be available at @xmath68 tev and a more precise nuclear modification factor will be displayed .",
    "on the other hand the decreasing tendency of the nuclear modification factor at @xmath69 gev / c clearly displays the presence of jet energy loss and these new data at lhc deny the presence of simple participant nucleon number scaling , which idea was very popular at rhic energies to explain the very flat nuclear modification factor at high-@xmath64 in @xmath70 collisions .",
