    "in a work by susskind  @xcite it was asserted that the non - commutative chern - simons ( nccs ) gauge theory in @xmath12 dimensional space is equivalent to laughlin theory  @xcite at filling factor @xmath13 , with @xmath14 a positive ( odd ) integer .",
    "this formulation leads to a matrix model similar to that describing @xmath15-branes in string theory and has opened a revival interest in the study of the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite in terms of nccs theory .",
    "in particular a regularized version has been proposed by polychronakos  @xcite where a quantum correction to the susskind filling factor and the corresponding ground state has been constructed  @xcite .",
    "other investigations about the relation between nccs and laughlin fluids can be found in recent works  @xcite .",
    "the susskind model and its regularized version has been extended to quantum hall ( qh ) states that are not of the laughlin type in a multi - component chern - simons approach  @xcite and another based on the haldane hierarchy  @xcite has been developed  @xcite . also a matrix model for bilayered qh systems",
    "@xcite has been considered as well as an isotropic qh one  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a supersymmetric matrix model ( smm ) for quantum hall fluids and thus generalized the original susskind  polychronakos ( sp ) theory for the laughlin states .",
    "it can be used to describe a class of fractional qh systems resulting from two sets u and d of @xmath0 bosons and @xmath1 fermions . in our proposal ,",
    "the states of these sets are imagined as two states of a world line supersymmetric representation with @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the superpartner of the particle @xmath19 .",
    "our supersymmetric extension ( se ) of the sp model gives new solutions for laughlin states with the total filling factor @xmath20 .",
    "more precisely , we consider a qh system of @xmath21 bosons and fermions @xmath22 with @xmath23 quantum fluxes @xmath24 and investigate its basic features .    to achieve this proposal , we develop a smm for a fractional qh system and",
    "show how this can describe u and d together .",
    "we write the smm action and derive the supersymmetric constraint equations .",
    "these will be solved to obtain wave functions for the lowest landau level and the corresponding filling factors . throughout this study , we obtain new results which can be interpreted in terms of supersymmmetric representation theory . in particular , we find two polychronakos effects coming with opposite signs and cancel each other exactly in agreement with bose - fermi cancellation .    before doing this task , we develop and discuss another interesting result .",
    "this concerns a general relation governing filling factor and energy of a given qh system .",
    "it allows us to study the @xmath25  corrections in fractional qh systems and therefore give some information on the behavior of the collective motions of the interacting qh particles .",
    "this has another consequence , mainly it can be used to derive an immediate description of a qh system combining bosons and fermions .",

    "this will be used in dealing with a qh system combining bosons and fermions from the quantum mechanics point of view . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the supersymmetric extension of the sp construction by using two approaches : component fields and world line superfields = 1 supersymmetry ( susy ) in four - dimensional can be found in  @xcite .",

    "this can be done by considering the classical integral measure @xmath100 as the mean value over the @xmath21 measure integrals @xmath101 associated with the coordinates @xmath102 within the droplet @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 stand for @xmath106 and @xmath107  respectively . now using the fact that @xmath102 variables are nothing but the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrices @xmath78 and @xmath108",
    ", one can rewrite ( [ 11a ] ) as @xmath109 where @xmath78 ( @xmath110 ) and its conjugate momentum @xmath108 ( @xmath111 ) are representants of the @xmath2 gauge orbit @xmath112 with these matrix variables , the classical relation for the flux integral @xmath113 can be written as @xmath114 where @xmath115 stands for the hilbert space of the droplet .",
    "this is a remarkable relation first because it expresses the number @xmath97 in terms of the coordinates of the phase space of the sp model and second because of its interpretation at the quantum level . by using an analysis similar to that we have adopted for ( [ 4 ] ) , we can also obtain @xmath116 where the flux number operator @xmath117 that follows from ( [ 13 ] ) is given by @xmath118 now using ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ num ] ) , we can show that @xmath119 which implies in turn that for the sp model there is a close relation between @xmath117 and @xmath80 , namely @xmath120 or equivalently by using ( [ 131 ] ) @xmath121 this tells us that the energy spectrum of the present system can be measured in terms of the quantum flux number and the number of electrons .",
    "note also that for a fixed number of particles @xmath21 , energy variation is induced by the variation of the flux .",
    "equation ( [ 142 ] ) is an interesting result since it has three different consequences .",
    "first , it relates the filling factor @xmath123  ( [ ffd ] ) to the energy of the states .",
    "indeed , substituting @xmath124 we end up with @xmath125 for the lowest landau level of energy @xmath94 , the quantum flux is @xmath126 and @xmath123 reduces to the familiar formula @xmath127    at this stage , we believe a remark is in order . as we know , it is not so easy to solve interacting qh systems .",
    "nevertheless , one can always use some other technique to acquire more information about such systems .",
    "for instance , in the perturbation theory the energy @xmath128 can be expanded as @xmath129 where @xmath130 are the perturbated energies and @xmath131 are smaller than one .",
    "now ( [ fo ] ) becomes @xmath132 which suggests that one may expand it in a perturbative series @xmath133 with the leading term given by @xmath134 of the ground state . for a strongly correlated system with a large gap ,",
    "particles are mainly confined in the lowest landau level . in this case , by using ( [ 141 ] ) , we can show that ( [ 131 ] ) reduces to @xmath135 with the help of @xmath136 which can be seen from ( [ 9 ] ) , we obtain @xmath137 this leads to the well - known filling factor @xmath138 which is in agreement with @xcite .    a second comment concerns the general expression for @xmath128 and @xmath97 . from the way of building up the sp wave functions @xmath67",
    ", we note that the expectation value @xmath139 can be usually written as a power series in terms of the integer @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that the total energy @xmath128 of the sp approach can be expanded as @xmath140 where @xmath141 are rational numbers whose two leading terms are @xmath142 now by comparing ( [ 142 ] ) and ( [ 161 ] ) , we obtain @xmath143 with this relation , one can compute the finite part of the ratio @xmath144 to obtain the general form of the filling factor in such way that @xmath145 which is a @xmath146 expansion series . note",
    "that it converges to @xmath147 ( [ fff ] ) in the limit @xmath148 .",
    "the extra terms can be interpreted as @xmath146 quantum fluctuations .    a third aspect upon which we wish to comment concerns another property of ( [ fo ] ) .",
    "in general , this relation may be applied to the se of the sp model , which we will study later . in the absence of mutual interactions between bosons and fermions ,",
    "the total energy @xmath128 of the supersymmetric qh system is the sum of two parts @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 refer , respectively , to bosons and fermions .",
    "then by adopting the above analysis one expects that the corresponding filling factor is given by @xmath152",
    "generally speaking a particle confined to a plane in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xmath29 behaves as a 1d field @xmath153 @xmath154 with conjugate momentum particles , the conjugate momenta @xmath155 are thought of as the eigenvalues of a @xmath34 hermitian matrix field @xmath156 .",
    "the @xmath157 and @xmath158 matrices satisfy the heisenberg algebra with central extension proportional to the inverse of the external magnetic field . ]",
    "@xmath159 @xmath160 .",
    "the theories of such configurations are quite well understood and the matrix model of the previous section is one of them . for a system combining bosons and fermions , one may have an interesting situation that deserves to take care of .",
    "a generic configuration of such a system can be imagined as consisting of two phases : u involving @xmath161 bosons and d involving @xmath162 fermions .",
    "to fix the ideas , we take these numbers as @xmath163 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are positive integers . note that for @xmath164 , we have no d phase and the qh system is the one described in previous section . for non - zero @xmath4 ,",
    "the situation is important in the sense that is quite realistic . in particular",
    ", @xmath165 is interesting because it has much to do with the se of the sp model .",
    "therefore , we claim that our supersymmetric generalization of the sp theory modelled the u and d configurations with a positive odd integer @xmath3 and @xmath165 .",
    "we start by recalling that in the smm we have essentially the same tools and machinery as those we generally have in the sp model .",
    "the main difference is that the usual qh system is now replaced by another system describing multiplets involving bosonic and fermionic states .",
    "the main novelties in the smm are of two types :    * ( i ) * this model describes two kinds of the fractional qh subsystems : bosons and fermions ( superpartner ) forming , respectively , u and d phases .",
    "classically , they are described by two pairs of 1d fields namely the super - position coordinates @xmath166 interchanged under supersymmetric transformations ( st ) and their respective conjugate momenta @xmath167 they are related by @xmath168 supersymmetry ( susy ) as @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a parameter of the susy group with @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "note that the st we are using here is the world line susy .",
    "it should be distinguished from the target space susy which might also be considered for building more general super qh systems with rich invariance .",

    "we will use it as a basic symmetry in the action and only impose it at the level of the hilbert space of wave functions describing the fractional qh system . since we are going to consider large but still finite @xmath34 matrices , we need to introduce the polychronakos vector field @xmath177 as well as its superpartner @xmath178 @xmath179 to write the action of the world line smm",

    "the latter involves auxiliary fields and is more general . for completeness",

    "one way to build the world line smm is to use a direct method based on component field techniques .",
    "this allows us to derive immediately the world line se of the constraint equation ( [ 3b ] ) and write down the corresponding supersymmetric invariant action .",

    "<S> we develop a supersymmetric extension of the susskind - polychronakos matrix theory for the quantum hall fluids . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by considering a system combining two sets of different particles and using both a component field method as well as world line superfields . </S>",
    "<S> our construction yields a class of models for fractional quantum hall systems with two phases u and d involving , respectively @xmath0 bosons and @xmath1 fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we build the corresponding supersymmetric matrix action , derive and solve the supersymmetric generalization of the susskind - polychronakos constraint equations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the general @xmath2 gauge invariant solution for the ground state involves two configurations parameterized by the bosonic contribution @xmath3 ( integer ) and in addition a new degree of freedom @xmath4 , which is restricted to @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail the two particular values of @xmath4 and show that the classical ( susskind ) filling factor @xmath7 receives no quantum correction . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the polychronakos effect is exactly compensated by the opposite fermionic contributions .    </S>",
