    "establishing a quantum theory of gravity ( also called quantum gravity ) is one of the main challenges in modern physics . to gain insights into the development of such quantum theories , it is useful to investigate experimentally accessible quantum gravity effects . in general , such effects are very small , expected to be inversely proportional to the planck energy scale @xmath3 gev .",
    "even so , current experimental results , mainly from high - energy physics , astrophysics , and cosmology , can set meaningful bounds on parameters relevant to models on quantum gravity",
    ". a lot of work has been done , and references can be found in a recent review paper @xcite .    here , we are interested in one particular quantum gravity effect , the so - called generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) . according to the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( hup ) , the uncertainties in the measurement of the length and the momentum satisfy the relation @xmath4\\rangle|=\\hbar/2 $ ] .",
    "in other words , the uncertainty @xmath5 is bounded by @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , on the cost of the information of the momentum @xmath7 , the length can be arbitrarily precisely measured . on the other hand",
    ", it has long been known that various models on quantum gravity predict the existence of a minimum measurable length @xcite .",
    "thus , this forces people to modify the hup to the gup .",
    "the gup has various implications on a wide range of physical systems , especially in the quantum regime .",
    "for example , effects of the gup on the thermodynamics of the quark - gluon plasma were studied in ref .",
    "the impact of the gup on thermodynamical parameters and the stability of the schwarzschild black hole was investigated in ref .",
    "the gup approach was also used to calculate quantities of the inflationary dynamics and the thermodynamics of the early universe @xcite .",
    "the violation of the equivalence principle due to the gup effects was discussed in refs .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested that experimental data of the lamb shift , the landau levels , and the tunneling current in a scanning tunneling microscope could be used to constrain the gup corrections @xcite .",
    "a direct measurement of the gup effects in quantum optics laboratory was proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "more references can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in recent years",
    ", rapid technological advances in atom interferometry have been achieved . due to their high sensitivity , atom interferometers",
    "have already been used in various precision measurements , and many important experimental results came out .",
    "for example , the value of the newtonian gravitational constant was measured to be @xmath8 @xcite , which just differs by 1.5 combined standard deviations from the codata recommended value @xcite .",
    "a @xmath9-level test of the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) was reported in a recent work @xcite .",
    "atom interferometers can also be used to search deviations from newton s @xmath10 law at the micrometer scale @xcite .",
    "another important application of atom interferometers in precision measurements is the determination of the fine structure constant , @xmath11 .",
    "a value of @xmath12=137.035999037(91 ) was obtained @xcite , which is the second best value compared to the one deduced from the electron anomaly measurement @xcite .",
    "more details on atom interferometers can be found in many review papers , such as ref .",
    "@xcite . inspired by these achievements with atom interferometry",
    ", people began to think about the possibility of studying quantum gravity effects on atomic physics .",
    "one such study was given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors used the atom recoil measurement @xcite to constrain parameters in the energy - momentum dispersion relation modified by quantum gravity .    in this paper , we investigate the possibility of using the cold atom recoil measurement to constrain parameters in three popular gup proposals .",
    "improved bounds on these parameters are found .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , three popular gup proposals are introduced .",
    "then a brief description of the cold atom recoil experiment is given in sect .",
    "iii . through a detailed calculation of the gup effects on the cold atom recoil measurement , bounds on the gup parameters are obtained in sect .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in sect . v.",
    "as discussed above , various models on quantum gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity suggest the existence of a minimum measurable length .",
    "consequently , this indicates that the hup should be modified to the gup at energies close to the planck energy scale @xmath13 .",
    "but at the moment no model has the power of making robust predictions on what the gup should be .",
    "the alternative way is making various proposals on the gup .",
    "depending on what indications from models on quantum gravity should be incorporated , many different gup proposals have been made @xcite . here , we discuss three popular ones .",
    "first , let us consider the so - called kempf - mangano - mann ( kmm ) proposal , which was first discussed in ref .",
    "the authors were motivated by the observation that a variety of models of quantum gravity predicted a leading quadratic - in - the - momenta - type correction to the hup . to incorporate this observation ,",
    "the following form is proposed : @xmath14=i \\hbar \\left(\\delta_{ij } + \\frac{\\beta_0}{(m_p c)^2 } \\delta_{ij } p^2 + \\frac{2\\beta_0}{(m_p c)^2 } p_i p_j\\right ) , \\label{kmm}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a dimensionless parameter , and @xmath16 is the planck mass .",
    "all other commutation relations vanish .",
    "it is easy to find the following uncertainty relation @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "this inequality relation implies a minimum measurable length @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the planck length .",
    "theoretically , the planck length is believed to be the minimal measurable length .",
    "thus , @xmath15 is normally assumed to be of the order of unity .",
    "however , if one does not take the above assumption _ a priori _ , current experiments can set upper bounds on it .",
    "for example , the standard model of high - energy physics is well tested at energy scale 100 gev , which implies that @xmath21 .",
    "better bounds are obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the best one @xmath22 is set by the tunneling current measurement .",
    "next , we discuss the ali - das - vagenas ( adv ) proposal , which was first put forward in ref .",
    "the authors observed that doubly special relativity theories @xcite suggested a leading linear - in - the - momenta type correction to the hup . to incorporate both the linear and the quadratic in - the - momenta corrections , they proposed the following form : @xmath23&= & i \\hbar \\left(\\delta_{ij } - \\frac{\\eta_0}{m_p c } ( \\delta_{ij } p+ p_i p_j / p)\\right.\\\\   & & \\left .",
    "+ \\frac{\\eta_0 ^ 2}{(m_p c)^2}(\\delta_{ij } p^2 + 3 p_i p_j)\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a dimensionless parameter , and is normally assumed to be of the order of unity .",
    "all other commutators vanish . again ,",
    "if the assumption on @xmath24 is not taken _ a priori _ , one can use current experiments to set upper bounds on it .",
    "the minimum measurable length of this proposal is easy to find to be @xmath25 .",
    "then , an immediate bound from high - energy physics is @xmath26 .",
    "the best bound is set by the lamb shift measurement @xcite , which is @xmath27 .",
    "the last proposal to be discussed is maggiore s proposal @xcite , which is motivated by the relationship between the gup and the quantum deformation of the poincar@xmath28 algebra .",
    "the author gave the proposal @xmath14=i \\hbar \\ , \\delta_{ij}\\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\gamma_0}{(m_p c)^2}(p^2+m^2 c^2 ) } , \\label{maggiore1}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a dimensionless parameter , and is normally assumed to be of the order of unity .",
    "if this assumption is not taken _ a priori _ , current experiments can be used to set upper bounds on it .",
    "the minimum measurable length of this proposal is found to be @xmath30 .",
    "again , a direct bound from high - energy physics is @xmath31 . currently , no other bounds are available .",
    "since @xmath32 is very small , one can make taylor series expansion on eq .",
    "( [ maggiore1 ] ) @xmath14=i \\hbar \\ , \\delta_{ij}\\left(1+\\frac{\\gamma_0}{2(m_p c)^2}(p^2+m^2 c^2)\\right).\\ ] ] compared to the kmm proposal , the above formula is very similar to it , and can be regarded as a generalization of it .",
    "but the difference will be important later .",
    "type atomic interferometer combined with @xmath33 bloch oscillations.,width=400 ]    a typical cold atom recoil experiments can be described with the schematic diagram shown in fig .",
    "1 , where two hyperfine ground states of atoms are labeled by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . it combines a ramsey - bord@xmath36-type atomic interferometer with bloch oscillations so that as many as possible recoils can be coherently transferred to atoms and atomic velocities can be accurately measured with the raman transition between two hyperfine ground states .",
    "details of the experimental setup can be found in ref .",
    "the experimental procedure can be described as follows .",
    "a slow atomic beam , prepared in the @xmath34 state by a two - dimensional magneto - optical trap ( 2d - mot ) , is loaded into the interferometer through a standard three - dimensional magneto - optical trap ( 3d - mot ) .",
    "after a few seconds of cooling , a first pair of raman @xmath37/2 pulses , realized by using two counterpropagating laser beams with frequencies @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and wave vectors @xmath40 and @xmath41 , is applied to create two coherent atomic beams in the @xmath35 state , and define an initial velocity distribution centered on @xmath42 .",
    "then , atoms remaining in the @xmath34 state are blown away by a resonant laser beam tuned to the single photon transition .",
    "this process is called velocity selection of atoms . at resonance , according to the energy conservation law , we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mass of atoms , @xmath45 is the single photon detuning of the atomic levels , and @xmath46 is the energy difference between the @xmath34 state and the @xmath47 state .",
    "this equation can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is defined to be the raman detuning from the atomic resonance .",
    "after the velocity selection , a number of @xmath33 bloch oscillations are applied to both atomic beams .",
    "bloch oscillations are an efficient way of transferring very high recoil velocities to atoms in a short time , while leaving the internal state of atoms unchanged . by using two counterpropagating laser beams ,",
    "atoms are coherently accelerated through a succession of two - photon raman transitions . in each bloch oscillation , the atomic velocity increases by 2@xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the recoil velocity of the atom when absorbing a photon of momentum @xmath52 .",
    "thus , a final velocity , @xmath53 , is achieved for atoms .",
    "finally , a second pair of raman @xmath37/2 pulses is applied to read out the final velocity distribution centered on @xmath54 , and transfer the atoms back to the @xmath34 state . again , according to the energy conservation law , the raman detuning for the velocity measurement is found to be @xmath55    subtracting eq .",
    "( [ sel ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ meas ] ) , one can easily find that @xmath56 then , the ratio @xmath57 is determined by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the planck constant .",
    "more importantly , the fine structure constant @xmath11 can be deduced from the value of @xmath57 with the well - known relation @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the rydberg constant , @xmath62 is the speed of light , and @xmath63 is the electron mass .    the best measurement of @xmath57 was given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the 5s@xmath64 @xmath65f=2 , m@xmath66=0@xmath67 and 5s@xmath64 @xmath65f=1 , m@xmath66=0@xmath67 states of @xmath0rb atoms were adopted as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the atomic beam was prepared in the @xmath68 state with an initial velocity @xmath69 m / s .",
    "the bloch oscillations were generated by a ti : sapphire laser with wavelength @xmath70 nm .",
    "a number of @xmath71 bloch oscillations were applied to @xmath0rb atoms in each run . after a careful analysis of error budget ,",
    "the value of @xmath72 was measured to be @xmath73    in the next section , we will discuss how to use the above measurement to constrain parameters in previous three gup proposals .",
    "following the procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite , we make redefinitions in the kmm proposal ( [ kmm ] ) , @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath76 and @xmath77 now satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath78=i \\hbar \\ , \\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "thus , it is natural to interpret @xmath79 as momentum at a low - energy scale , i.e. , @xmath80 in position space .",
    "@xmath81 can be regarded as momentum at a high - energy scale .",
    "consider a quantum system with the hamiltonian @xmath82 with the redefinitions ( [ redef ] ) , the above hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath83 where @xmath84 higher order terms are omitted .",
    "next we apply the gup - corrected hamiltonian [ eq .",
    "( [ gupkin ] ) ] to the cold @xmath0rb atoms .",
    "it turns out that the gup effects modify the kinetic energy of @xmath0rb atoms into @xmath85 repeating the previous derivation , we find a gup - corrected relation : @xmath86 combining this equation with eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) , one can get @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "note that @xmath61 , @xmath11 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are all measured with very high accuracy .    with values in table i , and the measurement ( [ hmeas ] )",
    ", we finally find that @xmath91 this bound on @xmath15 is weaker than those set by high - energy physics and measurements of the lamb shift , and better than the one from measurements of landau levels @xcite .",
    "the reason is that @xmath15 is always associated with the factors , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , in the calculation .",
    "even if heavier atoms are chosen , the factor @xmath92 could not be substantially greater than @xmath94 .",
    "since we are talking about cold atoms , the factor @xmath93 is at most of order @xmath95 .",
    "taking these two limitations into consideration , it is hopeless for cold atom recoil experiments to give a better bound on @xmath15 than the one from high - energy physics .",
    "but things are different for the adv proposal .",
    ".quantities used in our calculation [ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      similar to the case of the kmm proposal , make redefinitions in the adv proposal : @xmath96 now @xmath76 and @xmath77 satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath78=i \\hbar \\ , \\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "then , taking the redefinitions ( [ advred ] ) to the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , we have @xmath97    we the apply this gup - corrected hamiltonian to the cold @xmath0rb - atom system .",
    "the kinetic energy of @xmath0rb atoms is modified by the gup effects as @xmath98 where only the linear term in @xmath99 is kept . by a similar derivation",
    ", one can get a gup - modified relation @xmath100 using eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) , we find that @xmath101    the measurement ( [ hmeas ] ) and quantities in table i determine an upper bound @xmath102 this bound on @xmath24 is better than those set by high - energy physics and measurements of landau levels , and weaker than the one from measurements of the lamb shift @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath24 is always associated with the factors , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , in the calculation .",
    "compared to the case of the kmm proposal , effects from the adv proposal are larger .",
    "better bounds can be found in the future .",
    "but it is challenging to set an order - of - unity bound on @xmath24 with cold atom recoil experiments .",
    "as before , we make the following redefinitions in maggiore s proposal @xmath105 then , @xmath76 and @xmath77 satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath78=i \\hbar \\ , \\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "if we apply the redefinitions ( [ maggiorered ] ) to the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , we can get @xmath106    with this gup - corrected hamiltonian , the kinetic energy of @xmath0rb atoms is consequently modified into @xmath107 after a simple derivation , we can find a gup - modified relation @xmath108 together with eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) , we finally get @xmath109 where terms involved in @xmath110 and @xmath111 have been omitted .",
    "thus , the measurement ( [ hmeas ] ) , together with quantities in table i , sets an upper bound @xmath112 it is obvious that this bound on @xmath29 is much better than the one set by high - energy physics , which is very different from the case for the kmm proposal .",
    "the reason is that @xmath29 is only associated with the factor @xmath92 in the calculation . without a further suppression due to the factor @xmath93 ,",
    "the bound on @xmath29 is almost 13 orders better than the one on @xmath15 .",
    "this feature makes maggiore s proposal easier to test than the kmm proposal .",
    "we have discussed three proposals for the gup , and investigated how to use results from cold atom recoil experiments to constrain parameters in these proposals .",
    "the main reason to take the @xmath0rb atom recoil experiment is that all the physical quantities involved can be measured with very high precision .",
    "compared to bounds set from high - energy physics and other experiments , our bound on the kmm proposal is worse , which is mainly due to the suppression by the factor @xmath93 . in other words ,",
    "cold atom recoil experiments are not suitable for studying effects of the kmm proposal .",
    "things are totally different for the adv proposal and maggiore s proposal .",
    "we get the second best bound on the adv proposal , and the best bound on maggiore s proposal . the high preciseness of the @xmath0rb atom recoil experiment plays the crucial role in giving these impressive bounds . however , these bounds are still many orders higher than theoretical predictions .",
    "thus , to test various theories of quantum gravity , we have to resort to other possible atomic physics experiments .",
