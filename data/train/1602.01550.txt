    "1743 , located at a distance of 8.5@xmath00.8 kpc @xcite , was discovered by the _",

    "observations with the _ heao - i _ satellite allowed to determine the position more accurately and ruled out an association with 4u 1755388 @xcite .",
    "it belongs to the few sources where x - ray jets have been imaged @xcite .",
    "1743  has very frequent outbursts , unlike most of the other black hole transients ( bhts ) .",
    "it showed its brightest outburst in 2003 ( @xmath1100 cts / s in rxte / asm ) that was studied by rxte and integral , followed by outbursts in september 2004 , september 2005 , and january 2008 @xcite .",
    "after the source showed a `` failed '' outburst in october 2008 @xcite it showed another ( `` full '' ) outburst in july 2009 @xcite .",
    "three additional outbursts have been observed in december 2009/ january 2010 , august 2010 and april 2011 @xcite .",
    "further outbursts have been reported in december 2011/january 2012 @xcite , september 2012 @xcite and august 2013 @xcite .",
    "most outbursts reached around 20 cts / s in rxte / asm 1.5  12 kev range , with the `` failed '' outburst in 2008 being the faintest one with @xmath110 cts / s in rxte / asm ( see fig .  1 in * ? ? ? * for a longterm rxte / asm light curve ) . based on the x - ray dipping behaviour observed in one observation it is believed that the inclination angle of its accretion disc is relatively high ( @xmath270@xmath3 ) to our line of sight @xcite",
    ". a systematic study of the effect of orbital inclination on the shape of the hid and the accretion disc temperature supports a high inclination angle for 1743 @xcite .",
    "regarding the outburst evolution of bhts there are two distinct patterns .",
    "most bhts evolve from the low hard state ( lhs ) through the hard and soft intermediate states ( hims , sims ) into the high soft state ( hss ) , before they return at a substantial lower luminosity passing again the intermediate states @xcite back to the lhs .",
    "some bhts stay in the lhs during the entire outburst ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a list of bhts that show lhs - only outbursts ) .",
    "individual states have distinct timing properties .",
    "power density spectra ( pds ) obtained in the lhs are dominated by band - limited noise ( bln ) and can show quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "when the bht goes from the lhs to the hims the pds obtained in the energy range covered by the rxte / pca detector (  @xmath22 kev ) show an increasing amplitude and centroid frequency of the ( type - c ) qpo ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a classification of the different qpo types ) .",
    "investigations of pds in different energy bands , including softer energies , revealed the existence of two distinct power spectral shapes at soft and hard x - rays at the onset of the hims @xcite .    in 2008",
    "1743  showed an outburst in which it went to the hims , but then returned to the lhs without ever reaching the soft states .",
    "compared to previous outbursts , where the source went to the hss , the inner disc temperature did not vary substantially during outburst evolution and remained rather high for a hims ( @xmath4kev ) , while the inner disc radius decreased and the flux of the blackbody component increased @xcite .",
    "@xcite supposed that the returning to the lhs without entering into the soft states was connected to a premature decrease of the mass accretion rate .",
    "this kind of outburst that does not make it to the soft state was dubbed  failed \" outburst by @xcite .",
    "this naming is somewhat misleading since an outburst has taken place and as no outburst is bound to reach the soft state .",
    "to get an impression of the behaviour of 1743  during its outburst in 2014 , we derived a hardness intensity diagram using _",
    "swift_/xrt ( the x - ray telescope ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ swift_/xrt window timing mode data were taken between september 16 and october 10 .",
    "the hardness ratio was obtained by dividing the count rate in the 3.0  10.0 kev band by the count rate in the 0.8  3.0 kev band . from the hid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hid ] ) it is obvious that the source showed very little spectral evolution and that its spectrum remained rather hard during the entire outburst . in the observation that is softest the source still shows a fractional rms value above 30 per cent .",
    "such high variability is only seen when a bht is in the lhs , while in the soft states rms values below 5 per cent are observed ( see   * ? ? ?",
    "the energy spectrum obtained during this observation can be described well ( @xmath5/dof=949.1/817 ) by an absorbed power law with a photon index of @xmath6 .",
    "the spectral and timing properties indicate that the source remained hard and that 1743  did not reach the soft states during its 2014 outburst .",
    "in this paper , we present a comprehensive spectral and variability study of 1743  based on an   observation obtained on september 24th 2014 ( pi : stiele ; exposure time 51.436  ks ) .",
    "this observation was taken during outburst rise , about ten days after the detection of renewed activity of 1743  by integral @xcite .",
    "a series of _ swift _ too observations were proposed to trace the low frequency qpo and spectral evolution in 1743 , which helped us to trigger an observation with  of its brightest hard state usually expected just before a hard - to - soft transition .",
    "1743  was observed with the epic / pn camera in timing mode .",
    "we filtered and extracted the pn event file , using standard sas ( version 14.0.0 ) tools , paying particular attention to extract the list of photons not randomized in time .",
    "as the sas task ` epatplot ` showed no significant deviations of the observed pattern distribution from the theoretical prediction in the 0.8  8 kev range , the observation was not affected by pile - up and we extracted source photons from a 15 column wide strip centred on the column with the highest count rate ( 31@xmath7rawx@xmath745 ) .",
    "we selected single and double events ( pattern@xmath74 ) for our study .",
    "we extracted light curves and produced power density spectra ( pds ) in different energy bands ( individual bands are specified in sect .",
    "[ sec : res ] ) for the longest continuous exposure available ( a segment of 31.8  ks ) . after verifying that the noise level at frequencies above 30  hz is consistent with the one expected for poissonian noise @xcite",
    ", we subtracted the contribution due to poissonian noise , normalised the pds according to @xcite and converted to square fractional rms .",
    "the pds were fitted with models composed of zero - centered lorentzians for bln components , and lorentzians for qpos following @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we derived covariance spectra following the approach described in @xcite . as reference band we used the energy range between 1 and 4 kev , taking care to exclude energies from the reference band that are in the channel of interest .",
    "we also extracted the averaged energy spectrum .",
    "as for the timing study we used the epic / pn data and selected source photons from a 15 column wide strip in rawx centred on the column with the highest count rate , including single and double events . no energy selection has been applied here .",
    "background spectra have been extracted from columns 3 to 5 . using standard sas tools",
    "( ` rmfgen ` and ` arfgen ` ) and the latest calibration files the corresponding redistribution matrix and ancillary response file have been determined .",
    "since energy spectra obtained from epic / pn fast - readout mode data are known to be affected by gain shift due to charge - transfer inefficiency and show excess emission below @xmath11 kev , we also produced calibrated rgs event lists , energy spectra , and response matrices using the sas task ` rgsproc ` .",
    "due to the presence of this soft excess emission we limited our spectral studies to energies above 0.8 kev , the limit suggested in the epic calibration status report .",
    "we included lower energies in the case of spectral ratios , as the division should remove the contribution of the excess emission , assuming that it is constant on the time scales considered .",

    "these narrow band pds are well described by a single bln component ( bln  1 ) and the qpo and its upper harmonic .",
    "naturally , the narrow energy bands contain significantly less photons than the broad 2  8 kev band which leads to a reduced signal - to - noise ratio in the pds which becomes quite evident as significantly increased error bars at high frequencies (  short time scales ) that hamper constraining bln  2 .",
    "this effect is already evident from a comparison of the soft and broadband pds shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pds ] . the rms spectrum of the bln component ( red crosses in lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rms_spec_indv ] ) shows a slight decrease with increasing energy .",
    "this kind of energy dependence is observed during the lhs only . in a study of xtej1650500 and",
    "xtej1550564 @xcite found that the rms spectrum in the lhs at energies below 10 kev is either flat or decreases with increasing energy , as seen here .",
    "the rms spectra of other states presented in @xcite do not show this kind of energy dependence at energies below 10 kev .",
    "a similar shape of the rms spectrum as found here has been observed for the bln of the 2008 observation of 1743   where the bln was observed at a similar frequency as here  and for the bln component with the highest characteristic frequency  which was above 1 hz  in two observations of gx3394 taken during lhs @xcite .    the measured characteristic frequency of the bln as well as of the qpos",
    "does not show a strong energy dependence and stays rather flat ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rms_spec_indv ] ) . according to our study on the bln in a sample of bhts @xcite this behaviour of the bln",
    "is seen in the early phases of the lhs , while later on the characteristic frequency is lower at softer energies .",
    "the value of the characteristic frequency of the qpo , the similar shape of the pds at soft and harder energies , the shape of the rms spectrum , and the energy dependence of the characteristic frequency of the bln are all consistent with 1743  being in the lhs at the time of our  observation .",
    "in addition , we derived covariance spectra on short and long timescales and obtained covariance ratios dividing the long timescale covariance spectrum by the short one . deriving ratios of covariance spectra we can remove features in the spectra that are caused by gain shift due to charge - transfer inefficiency and excess emission below @xmath11.3 kev , as these effects affect the spectra in the same way on the time scales used in this paper .",
    "thus , using ratios of spectra we can go to lower energies without worrying about spectral distortion due to the soft excess emission . using the same timescales as in @xcite :",
    "shorter time scales 0.1  s time bins measured in segments of 4  s ; longer time scales 2.7  s time bins in segments of 270  s ; the ratio ( long / short ) of these two spectra ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : covspecratio ] ) is mostly flat down towards the lower end of the energy scale contrary to the increase of the covariance ratio towards lower energies , which has been reported by @xcite who studied 339  and swiftj1753.5 - 0125 during a later phase of the lhs .",
    "taking a look at the pds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pds ] ) we find that the short timescale 0.25 hz start frequency bin is the characteristic qpo frequency , and the 5 hz end bin is the frequency of bln  2 .",
    "we adjust the short timescale range using 0.05  s time bins measured in segments of 1.5  s. this range now comprises the decaying part of the pds at higher frequencies , excluding the qpo and its upper harmonic . to make sure that the longer timescale range is also not affected by the qpo , we use 3  s time bins in segments of 270  s. comparing covariance on long to short timescales we still obtain a flat ratio ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : covspecratio ] ) .",
    "in addition , we define a time range that contains the qpo and its upper harmonic using 0.8  s time bins in segments of 6.4 or 5.7  s , to avoid overlap with the longer timescale range defined above .",
    "the covariance ratios derived from the frequency range of the qpo and of frequency ranges at higher or lower frequencies have also an overall flat shape ( fig .",
    "[ fig : covspecratio ] ) . in the energy range between 1  3 kev",
    "there may be some additional variability in the flat top noise compared to the qpo frequency range , while there seems to be additional variability in the decaying part over the qpo frequency range around 2 kev . to exclude that the results shown here are affected by intrinsic time lags in the data , we measured cross - spectral phase - lags between various energy bands , and we have confirmed that the lags between hard and soft band variations are smaller than the time bin sizes used to make the long and short time - scale covariance spectra @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented an approach to reconstruct the qpo waveform assuming a periodic function and using the amplitudes of and the phase difference between the qpo ( or fundamental or first harmonic ) and its upper ( or second ) harmonic .",
    "this reconstruction requires that a well - defined average underlying waveform exists , which can be tested by measuring that the ratio of the harmonic amplitudes and the phase difference between harmonics are clearly distributed around a mean value . in case of a highly non - linear decohering process",
    "a bias to the estimated underlying waveform may be introduced or it may be difficult to define a true waveform . as we do not have a full understanding of all the processes decohering the qpo , we define the waveform as a periodic function with the average qpo properties .",
    "we split the light curve of 31.8  ks continuous exposure into @xmath35 segments , with each segment containing @xmath36 time bins of a duration that equals five times the frame time .",
    "these values are chosen based on the assumption that the qpo can be regarded as periodic for @xmath37 cycles , where @xmath38 is the quality factor . as the broadband pds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pds ] ) shows a qpo and its upper harmonic at @xmath24 and @xmath31 hz we can use the centroid frequency and width of these features to measure the relative strength of each harmonic and the phase difference between the harmonics in each segment .",
    "the technical details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the resulting averaged waveform is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] .",
    "we fitted the averaged epic / pn spectrum within isis v.  1.6.2 @xcite in the 0.8  10 kev range , grouping the data to a minimum number of 20 channels and to a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of 3 .",
    "grouping data allows us to use @xmath5 minimisation to obtain the best fit .",
    "we included a systematic uncertainty of 1 per cent .",

    "we included additional gaussian components to model the excess emission below 1.3 kev and the features caused by gain shift due to charge - transfer inefficiency around 1.8 and 2.2 kev .",

    "[ fig : espec ] ) .",
    "the individual spectral parameters are given in table  [ tab : spec_par ] .",
    "to check how the features around 1.8 and 2.2 kev affect the spectral parameters we excluded the energy range between 1.7 and 2.3 kev from the epic / pn spectrum and repeated the fit with the model used above ( @xmath3938.4/76 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : espec ] ) .",
    "we found an increase in the inner disc radius and a slight decrease of the inner disc temperature ( see table  [ tab : spec_par ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the values of both parameters are consistent within error bars in both cases . to investigate the effect of the soft excess emission on the parameters of the thermal component , we included rgs data using the 0.8  2 kev range .",
    "as we are only interested in the general shape of the rgs spectra and not in individual absorption or emission lines in this energy range , we grouped rgs data to a minimum number of 5 channels and to a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of 3 . using the same model as above we obtained a fit with a @xmath40 of 389.7/333 ( fig .",

    "the inner disc temperature from our  observation is much lower than the temperatures reported from the 2008 outburst with rxte @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the pca instrument covered a harder energy band and thus only energy spectra obtained during a later phase of the outburst when the accretion disc is hotter require a thermal component . in the study of the 2008 outburst reported by @xcite spectral fits of most observations",

    "@xcite find that the transition luminosity actually correlates with the rate - of - increase of the x - ray luminosity among outbursts or flares in persistent x - ray binaries .",

    "a previous comparative study of the timing and spectral properties of 1743  during its 2008 and 2009 outbursts finds that the rms values of the pds and the centroid frequencies of the type - c qpos are consistent between the two outbursts , as is the evolution of the spectral parameters @xcite . investigating correlations between the centroid frequency of the qpo and spectral parameters",
    "@xcite finds that the correlations obtained from the 2008 `` failed '' outburst are consistent with correlations observed during other outbursts .    with respect to the open question of an observable that allows to predict the subsequent outburst evolution it is interesting to notice that in the present observation the covariance ratio shows a slight decrease towards lower energies . in studies of later phases of the lhs of 339  and swiftj1753.5 - 0125 @xcite",

    "@xcite we notice that for an observation of 1743  taken during early outburst rise ( about four days before the onset of the rxte monitoring ) in 2008 the covariance ratio is flat .",
    "this implies that 1743  in the 2008 and 2014 outbursts lacks of coherent variability at soft energies below 1 kev observed by , indicating that the emission in the soft band is neither dominated by the comptonized component nor the disc component , leading to a mixed and uncoupled variability .",

    "the fact that we see 1743  more edge - on than other sources like 339  can explain why the contribution of additional disc emission on longer time scales does not show up in the covariance ratio of 1743 .",
    "another possible explanation can be related to the fact that both observations of 1743  are taken during a failed outburst . in this case",
    "the presence or absence of additional soft band variability on longer time scales , which might indicate effective propagation of the mass accretion rate variation in the disc flow towards the emission region responsible for the soft band emission , might be the signature whether a source goes into a full or failed outburst , respectively . at the moment",

    "<S> the fact that neither the general shape of the observed power density spectrum nor the characteristic frequency show an energy dependence implies that the source still stays in the low - hard state at the time of our observation near outburst peak . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral properties agree with the source being in the low - hard state and a _ swift_/xrt monitoring of the outburst reveals that 1743  stays in the low - hard state during the entire outburst ( a.k.a .  ` </S>",
    "<S> failed outburst ' ) . we derive the averaged qpo waveform and obtain phase - resolved spectra . comparing the phase - resolved spectra to the phase averaged energy spectrum reveals spectral pivoting </S>",
    "<S> we compare variability on long and short time scales using covariance spectra and find that the covariance ratio does not show an increase towards lower energies as has been found in other black hole x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> there are two possible explanations : either the absence of additional disc variability on longer time scales is related to the rather high inclination of 1743  compared to other black hole x - ray binaries or it is the reason why we observe 1743  during a failed outburst . </S>",
    "<S> more data on failed outbursts and on high - inclination sources will be needed to investigate these two possibilities further .    </S>",
