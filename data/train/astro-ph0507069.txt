    "since long time , distribution of interstellar material has been used to understand the galactic structure .",
    "a number of studies have been carried out on the basis of reddening variation of stars and various parameters like reddening plane , solar offset , distribution of interstellar material in the sky etc .",
    "were derived using different kind of objects .",
    "fernie ( 1968 ) studied the galactic structure on the basis of classical cepheids .",
    "fitzgerald ( 1968 ) analysed the interstellar extinction within a few kpc of the sun using colour excesses of 7835 o to m stars and found that the reddening material is highly concentrated to the galactic plane .",
    "neckel & klare ( 1980 ) derived extinctions and distances for more than 11000 o to f stars and investigated the spatial distribution of interstellar extinction in the direction of @xmath11 . lately , open star clusters have been used to study the distribution of interstellar extinction at low - galactic latitude rather than the stars .",
    "this kind of study has an advantage over the stellar study since the distances and reddening derived through open clusters are regarded as more reliable than those derived through individual stars .",
    "furthermore the open star clusters span a wide range of galactic longitudes , latitudes and distances from the sun .",
    "janes & adler ( 1982 ) studied the galactic structure and distribution of clusters in the galactic plane from a catalog of 434 open clusters .",
    "pandey & mahra ( 1987 , hereafter pm87 ) used photometric data of the 462 open clusters within 1.5 kpc of the sun to investigate the spatial distribution of interstellar extinction and concluded that the galactic plane defined by the reddening material is inclined by an angle of @xmath12 and the sun is situated at a distance of about 10 pc above the plane of symmetry defined by the interstellar matter .",
    "pandey et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , on the basis of young open clusters of the same sample , found these values as @xmath13 and @xmath14 pc respectively . from the same data ,",
    "though , janes et al .",
    "( 1988 ) concluded that there are no significant undulations around the plane of symmetry within 4 kpc of the sun .",
    "however , conclusions drawn from the photometric data of the open clusters may have been affected by the considerable uncertainty in their parameter determinations like distance , reddening , age etc . as well as lack of homogeneous data .",
    "during last ten years , new data on the open clusters along with more precise determination of physical parameters have become available mainly due to large size telescopes and improved detectors like ccd which allowed us to obtain deeper photometry of the clusters .",
    "chen et al .  ( 1998 ) derived an analytical expression for the interstellar extinction as a function of galactic longitude and distance based on the observed distances and colour excesses of 434 open clusters within @xmath15 .",
    "recently dias et al .  (",
    "2002 ) provided a comprehensive catalogue of more than 1600 open clusters which also include the information available in the lynga catalogue ( 1987 ) as well as webda catalogue ( mermilloid , 1995 ) .",
    "the catalogue contains almost all the clusters known till date .",
    "it therefore seems worthwhile to re - investigate the classical problem of galactic structure with this improved informations . in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the spatial distribution of interstellar material and study the galactic structure using the physical parameters derived for a large sample of open clusters .",
    "the detail about the data used is explained in sect .",
    "2 . in sect .",
    "3 , we analyse the spatial distribution of interstellar extinction while the sect . 4 deals with the correlation of interstellar extinction with the different physical parameters of the clusters in order to understand galactic structure .",
    "the main results of the present study are summarized in sect .",
    "plane is shown in ( a ) .",
    "a number distribution of the clusters in log(age ) , distance from the sun ( cumulative number ) and the distance perpendicular to the galactic plane are shown in ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) respectively .",
    "few odd clusters lying quite far - away in the x - axis are not shown in ( d ) for the clarity of the histogram .",
    ", width=328,height=340 ]",
    "data for the present work is taken from the data base of open star clusters compiled by w. s. dias ( dias et al .",
    "2002 ) at the web site http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/@xmath16wilton/. dias et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported a catalogue of 1599 clusters at the cds , however , a total of 1632 clusters are available in the online catalogue updated till march , 2005 in which 747 clusters have distance and reddening informations .",
    "out of them , we have included only 722 clusters for our analysis since 20 of them are considered to be doubtful by the dss images inspection ( dias et al .",
    "2002 ) while 5 are pocr ( possible open cluster remnant , bica et al .",
    "the age informations of 602 clusters are also available out of these 722 clusters .",
    "the clusters are almost uniformly distributed in the longitude @xmath17 but are densely packed in the latitude @xmath18 near the galactic plane as seen in fig .",
    "the age histogram drawn in fig .",
    "1(b ) shows that the clusters are known in all the age range from 6 myrs to as much as 10 gyrs .",
    "though the clusters are observed up to a distance of about 15 kpc , however , it is seen that the number of clusters decreases with distance which suggests of possible distance and/or reddening effect on the detectability of clusters . when we plot the cumulative distribution of the clusters as a function of distance from the sun ( see fig .",
    "1(c ) ) , we found that the present cluster sample is complete only up to a distance of about 2 to 3 kpc .",
    "it is seen from the histogram of the distance perpendicular to the galactic plane ( @xmath19 ) plotted in fig 1(d ) that almost 90% clusters lie within 200 pc of the galactic plane .",
    "we notice that the clusters distribution is maximum at @xmath20 pc which indicates that the maximum reddening material may be lying below the galactic plane .",
    "a further study of this effect shall be discussed in sect .",
    "4.2 .     mag and 2.55 mag respectively .",
    "the position of sun is shown by a symbol of star at the center .",
    "five concentric circles at an equal distance of 1 kpc are drawn .",
    "the number of clusters in each distance bin are also given .",
    ", width=340,height=340 ]",
    "one of the characteristics of the interstellar extinction is its irregular structure in the sky . using the reddening of 722 open clusters which have been determined independently through the analysis of colour and magnitude of stars in the clusters , we map the extinction variation in the sky that is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "all the clusters are put on the galactic plane to draw the map . since most of the clusters having reddening information are observed within 5 kpc of the sun , we map here only first 5 kpc regions shown by 5 concentric circles at an equal distance of 1 kpc around the sun .",
    "the size of the dots are an indication of extinction in the sense that bigger the dots , larger the extinction is .",
    "the map shows a complex structure of the sky .",
    "one of the striking feature of the map is clumpy behaviour of the cluster distribution at some places like @xmath21 .",
    "the concentration of the reddening material to the galactic plane is quite visible in the region @xmath22 .. @xmath23 .. @xmath24 while the least absorption lie in the region @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "a galactic dust distribution map up to 3 kpc distance from the sun shown by neckel & klare ( 1980 ) also show similar picture .",
    "we compared the @xmath27 values for the open clusters given in the dias et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with the extinction map given by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter sfd98 ) which is based on the iras 100 @xmath28 m surface brightness converted to extinction and a comparison in three different latitude bins are shown in fig .",
    "we found a large discrepancy in the extinctions values towards open clusters in the sfd98 reddening map below @xmath29 .",
    "it is not unexpected since most contaminating sources have not been removed from the sfd98 maps as well as temperature structure of the galaxy is not well resolved at low galactic latitude . the comparisons at @xmath30 show that the sfd98 map is overestimated by a factor of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in comparison to the extinction based on the open clusters in the regions @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "chen et al . ( 1999 ) also found that sfd98 reddening map overestimates @xmath27 by a factor of 1.16 and 1.18 based on the study of globular and open clusters respectively at @xmath35 . in recent times , various authors have compared interstellar extinction in different regions of the sky with the sfd98 reddening map ( cf .",
    "arce & goodman , 1999 , cambrsy et al . 2001 , 2005 ,",
    "dutra et al .",
    "2002 , 2003a , 2003b ) and supported the fact that sfd98 map overestimates the extinction in many parts of the sky , if not in the whole sky .     vs @xmath17 ( left ) and @xmath18 ( right ) . in the upper panels ,",
    "the histogram of the mean value of reddening using bin sizes of @xmath36 in @xmath17 and @xmath37 in @xmath18 are shown .",
    ", width=328,height=377 ]    in order to study the distribution of extinction along the galactic longitude and latitude , we plot e(b - v ) against @xmath17 and @xmath18 in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) ; and distribution of the mean value of @xmath27 in the @xmath36 bin in @xmath17 and @xmath37 bin in @xmath18 in figs .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) respectively , however , around the peak in fig .",
    "4(d ) , we made smaller bin size of @xmath38 due to higher concentration of clusters .",
    "we have calculated the mean value of reddening ( @xmath39 ) , concentration of reddening ( @xmath40 ) which is defined as @xmath27 in the sub - region divided by total @xmath27 of the clusters and number of clusters ( @xmath41 ) for 5 different latitude range which are given in table 1 . from the figures and table ,",
    "one can easily notice following approximate though important features :    1 .",
    "that the reddening is comparatively larger and scattered in the direction of galactic center than the small and systematic variation in anti - center direction ( see figs 4(a ) and 4(c ) ) . on an average , the reddening is almost twice in the region @xmath22 .. @xmath23 .. @xmath24 than the rest of the region .",
    "most of the open clusters are concentrated near the galactic plane .",
    "however , we notice that the peak of the reddening is shifted by @xmath42 in the southwards of the galactic plane ( see figs .  4(b ) and 4(d ) ) .",
    "3 .   a simple approximation on the basis of @xmath27 informations of the open clusters",
    "indicate that about @xmath0 reddening material lie within @xmath43 of the galactic plane ( see table 1 ) .",
    ".the distribution of the clusters and reddening in different latitude range . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     though most of our results are in close agreement with the values determined in previous studies but it can be stated that a larger sample of clusters with better knowledge of their parameters enable us to achieve a considerable improvement in the analysis of galactic structure . furthermore , we provided an overview of the distribution of reddening material in the galactic plane .",
