    "there are several good reasons for studying atomic collisions .",
    "probably the most important one on the fundamental side is their suitability to shed light on the quantum dynamical many - particle problem .",

    "this is especially true for the antiproton - helium system under consideration in the present paper , which is arguably the simplest collision system with more than one electron ( complications associated with electron transfer processes or exchange effects are absent .",
    "this is in contrast to bare ion and electron impact . )",
    "this makes it a problem in which on the one hand the interaction between the electrons has to be taken into account , but which , on the other hand , is still simple enough to enable a numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation with present - day computers .",
    "these solutions can then serve as benchmarks for other methods , e.g. , time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) .    in the present paper",
    "we explore the tddft approach to the problem at hand and are especially concerned with correlation effects .",
    "there are two ways in which they are relevant in tddft : first , an approximation for the correlation potential is necessary to calculate the time evolution of the density ( called dynamical correlation in the following ) .",
    "second , the observables of interest must be expressed as density functionals ( we will call this functional correlation in the following ) .",
    "we investigate a recent model suggested in the context of laser - induced ionization @xcite for the treatment of the dynamical correlation , and one @xcite for the functional correlation , and we give an estimate for the error induced by functional correlation .",
    "furthermore , we will apply these approximations to collisions at lower energies than are usually considered .    in sec .",

    "the dependence is almost identical and a polynomial regression yields ( see also fig . [ korrint ] ) : @xmath85 in our context the case @xmath86 is irrelevant since such large ionizations do not arise .",
    "we will call the model that uses the analytical expression ( [ swb ] ) in ( [ ww - p ] ) the swb - approximation",
    ".      the observable problem can be circumvented by not trying to calculate the probabilities , but only the average ionization @xmath53 which can be written as @xmath87 from eq .",
    "( [ ww - p ] ) it follows immediately that the ionization can be calculated exactly from the non - interacting probabilities : @xmath88 if one wants to benchmark a certain approximation to the kohn - sham potential , the average ionization is the observable that should be used because it can be calculated exactly from the density .",

    "@xcite and hvelplund et al .",
    "@xcite ( figs . [ tcs_1_schranken ] and [ tcs_1_korrekturen ] ) .",
    "the figures show @xmath97 as a function of the projectile energy . in fig .",
    "[ tcs_1_schranken ] , the observable problem is considered by using the bounds according to eq .",
    "( [ observable - problem ] ) and interpreting @xmath98 as the best approximation for @xmath89 . in fig .",
    "[ tcs_1_korrekturen ] binomial and swb approximations are used .    the x - only approximation and the lk - approximation coincide for high energies .",
    "this is because for high energies there is not enough time for any change in the effective electron - electron - potential to make an important contribution .",
    "furthermore , both models coincide with the experimental data . for small energies",
    "we see differences .",
    "the correlation enlarges the cross section for a simple reason : in the antiproton - helium system an ionization larger than 1 is almost never reached , and for @xmath99 the correlation potential simply amplifies the hartree - exchange potential , which is repulsive . for a closer investigation of the correlation potential",
    "the helium atom has to be perturbed more strongly , e.g. , by a multiply charged ion .",
    "this would lead to higher average ionizations .",
    "the effect of the correlation potential on the cross sections is of the same order of magnitude as the possible deviations induced by the observable problem . except in the range from 10 to 30kev ,",
    "our results are not in contradiction with the results by knudsen et al .",
    "@xcite or hvelplund et al .",
    ". however , the uncertainties in our results due to the observable problem are quite large , so a strong agreement can not be claimed either , which makes a more definite statement impossible .",
    "supplemental to the comparison with experimental data , we compare our calculated tcs to various theoretical investigations of the system in question in fig .",
    "[ tcs_1_rechnungen ] . from the large body of published results",
    "we have included only those , which were obtained from a solution of the two - electron tdse , i.e. , which include correlation effects .",
    "a more comprehensive list of previous calculations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at high energies all calculations , except that by foster et al .",
    "@xcite , coincide .",
    "this agreement can be explained by perturbation theory . for small energies , the calculation by foster et al . and that by lee et al . agree with our x - only approximation , while the one by igarashi et al .",
    "agrees with our lk approximation .",
    "this leaves the question open , whether the lk approximation improves upon the x - only approximation .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ obsproblem ] , the average ionization is actually better suited for comparisons with experimental data and many - particle calculations since it can be expressed as a simple density functional and is only sensitive to the approximation used for the ks potential .",
    "figure  [ tcs_erwartung ] shows @xmath100 as a function of the impact energy .",
    "again , good agreement between our calculations , experiment and the calculation by daz et al .",
    "@xcite can be seen . for small energies",
    "there is good agreement between the x - only approximation and the calculation by foster et al .",
    "( while this agreement can already be seen in the one - fold ionization , it is not conclusive there because of the large uncertainties induced by the observable problem ) .",
    "this is another hint ( additional to the fact that @xmath99 ) that the x - only approximation is better suited for our system than the lk approximation .",
    "the reasons for the deviations between the results of our x - only calculation and that by foster et al .",
    "calculation for medium and high energies are not clear , but the good agreement of our results with the other shown data suggests that our results are solid in that region .    while no reasonable bounds can be given for the two - fold ionization probabilities , the approximations ( [ binomial ] ) , and ( [ swb ] ) in ( [ ww - p ] ) can be applied , yielding the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ tcs_2 ] . once again , x",
    "- only and lk approximations agree at high energies , while the tcs obtained from the lk approximation is higher at smaller energies .",
    "this confirms what has already been learned from the one - fold ionization .",
    "it can be seen that for two - fold ionization the observable problem is even more important than the question of the right approximation for the correlation potential .",
    "these large deviations introduced by the observable problem have to be considered a setback for the tddft approach . in order for tddft to be a viable approach for the calculation of two - fold ionization it would be necessary to find a much better approximation for the probability as a functional of the density than that which we applied .",
    "so far , we investigated impact energies larger than 5kev . however , lower energies are in principle accessible experimentally ( at cern ) and might prove to be interesting .",
    "straightforward application of our method leads to a numerical problem concerning the scattering states : while they are constructed in a way that is suited to describe whether an electron is in a scattering state or not , the dynamics of an electron in a scattering state are not described well .",
    "especially , the average electron - target distance is strongly underestimated and the electrons are found to be in close vicinity of the target . when the density obtained from such a state",
    "is used to calculate the kohn - sham potential , those electrons screen the target potential very strongly , leading to a much too high ionization probability . at sufficiently high energies",
    "this numerical effect is of no great concern since the time development is stopped before the effect grows large enough .",
    "for the results presented in this section we circumvent this problem by calculating the kohn - sham potential not from the full density , but only from that part obtained from the bound states : let @xmath101 be the bound basis states , @xmath102 the scattering states .",
    "the full density is @xmath103 we define the bound density by @xmath104 in the same way a free density @xmath105 can be defined ( note , however , that in general @xmath106 ) .",
    "calculating the potential by using only @xmath107 is equivalent to the assumption that an electron in a scattering state moves away very quickly and has no further influence on the problem .    in the low energy range ,",
    "the straight - line approximation for the projectile is no longer justified",
    ". instead we use a classical trajectory determined by the initial kinetic energy and the approximate force by the target nucleus and the electrons in the following way : we assume the target ( including the electrons ) to be a point charge with the time - dependent effective charge @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the distance between the projectile and the target nucleus at time @xmath26 .",
    "that means that the nuclear charge of @xmath110 is reduced by the electrons that were initially closer to the target nucleus than the projectile is at the considered time . ) because of the technical problems mentioned above .",
    "however , we also mimicked this dynamical effect by weighing the integral with the time - dependent ionization @xmath53 and obtained practically the same results . ]",
    "it is not taken into account that the target system is no longer inertial when the force between target and projectile is nonzero .",
    "this would lead to an additional term in the tdse @xcite . in a classical picture",
    "this effect can be described as the nucleus being pulled away from under the electrons which remain in place due to their inertia .",
    "we therefore expect that consideration of this effect would magnify the ionization cross sections .    for one - fold ionization ( fig .",
    "[ kleine_ene_1 ] ) as well as for two - fold - ionization ( fig .",
    "[ kleine_ene_2 ] ) we find that the curved trajectory leads to a higher ionization cross section .",
    "this is due to the fact that the effective impact parameter is reduced and the effective interaction time enhanced .",
    "while the quantitative results should be taken with a grain of salt due the simple modeling of the force on the projectile , it seems clear qualitatively that the trajectory effect is significant .",
    "we reiterate that non - inertial effects have been neglected , so that the real effect of the ( classical ) projectile - target interaction might be even larger .",
    "in this paper we have applied several approximations within tddft to the antiproton - helium collision system .",
    "we conclude that the correlation potential from ref .  @xcite is not suited for this system because its main characteristic",
    ", the discontinuity at @xmath111 does not come into play .",
    "hence , until a better approximation is found , the x - only approximation should be preferred for calculations within tddft .",
    "we saw that functional correlation and dynamic correlation are about equally large for one - fold ionization , whereas for two - fold ionization the functional correlation is the much more important effect . in the case of single ionization",
    "all those effects are negligible for sufficiently high energies . in order to test different approximations for the correlation potential",
    ", one should therefore focus on energies below 100kev . since functional correlation is also important in that regime",
    ", it is the average ionization that should be used for benchmarking . for energies below 5kev we showed that there is a trajectory effect that significantly magnifies one - fold as well as two - fold ionization ."
