    "assume that @xmath9 vary periodically with the discrete time variable @xmath10 .",
    "we will investigate limiting behavior of the nonautonomous difference equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 are contractions with respect to the first variable and @xmath13-periodic with respect to the second .",
    "that is , we assume there exists @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for all @xmath10 .",
    "we think of @xmath13 as the _ forcing period _ and @xmath18 as the _ memory length_. we will show below that solutions of the contractive , @xmath13-periodic difference equation ( [ maxeq ] ) converge to a unique periodic orbit with period @xmath13 , for all initial sequences .    in @xcite ,",
    "rank - type equations were proposed as a generalization of max - type equations .",
    "consider the difference equation @xmath19 where @xmath20-rank denotes the @xmath20th largest value .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that with the same contractiveness hypotheses , solutions converge to @xmath21 , the @xmath20th largest of the individual fixed points . in this paper",
    ", we further generalize this result to the periodically - forced case .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ theorem1 ] let @xmath22 be contractions with respect to the first variable and @xmath13-periodic with respect to the second .",
    "let @xmath23 .",
    "then for any initial sequence , the solution of the difference equation @xmath24 is asymptotically periodic with period @xmath13 .    unlike the autonomous case",
    ", in general we do not know how to find a formula for the periodic solution in terms of the individual dynamics of the @xmath3 . in the fourth section of this article",
    "we relate some partial progress in this direction .",
    "the conclusion of theorem [ theorem1 ] fails if @xmath25 in ( [ alpha ] ) , even if @xmath26 , the autonomous max - type case @xcite .",
    "we mention two well - known examples where the condition on @xmath27 does not hold .",
    "consider the difference equation @xmath28 although this is an autonomous max - type equation ( @xmath26 ) , is easy to check that all solutions have period @xmath29 . in this example , @xmath30 , and theorem [ theorem1 ] does not apply .",
    "the first - order difference equation @xmath31 has bounded , nonperiodic ( chaotic ) solutions for almost every initial condition @xmath32 . in this example , @xmath33 . as a dynamical system , this example is the upside - down tent map .",
    "[ examp0 ] for a straightforward application of theorem [ theorem1 ] , fix positive integers @xmath13 and @xmath34 , and denote by @xmath35 and @xmath36 two @xmath37 matrices of real numbers , where the entries @xmath38 . define the difference equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "thus the coefficients cycle through the rows of the matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 , forcing the equation with period @xmath13 .",
    "theorem [ theorem1 ] implies that all solutions converge asymptotically to a period @xmath13 solution .",
    "[ ex1 ] let @xmath35 be a @xmath37 matrix of positive real numbers and consider the recurrence @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it follows from theorem [ theorem1 ] ( applied to @xmath44 ) that the recurrence converges to a unique period @xmath13 orbit .",
    "note that this result is independent of the memory length @xmath18 .",
    "the periodicity of the limit only depends on the periodicity of the forcing .    in sufficiently simple cases",
    ", we can say more about the convergent solution . in section 4",
    ", we further pursue the special case @xmath45 of ( [ eq31 ] ) . a closed form for the globally attracting solution of ( [ eq31 ] ) is given by @xmath46 ( see example [ ex44 ] for details . ) the complexity of this solution contrasts with the simplicity of the case @xmath47 , which is simply @xmath48 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath49 be real numbers less than @xmath50 , @xmath51 be arbitrary real numbers , and @xmath13 be a positive integer .",
    "then it follows from theorem [ theorem1 ] that every solution of @xmath52 is asymptotically periodic with period @xmath13 .",
    "note that median is synonymous with 2-rank .",
    "it is easily checked that the condition @xmath53 implies that the functions @xmath54 are contractive , so the convergence is implied by theorem [ theorem1 ] .    our main convergence result theorem [ theorem1 ] will be proved as a special case of a more general result , corollary [ mainresult ] , which applies to a class of difference equations called sup - contractive .",
    "the next example is covered under the sup - contractive hypothesis , which is more general than a fixed @xmath20-rank .",

    "we will show in example [ ex37 ] that every solution of @xmath58 is asymptotically periodic with period @xmath13 .    in section 2 below , we develop some facts about functions that are contractive in the sup - norm .",
    "an important result is lemma [ ranknonexp ] which will imply that ( [ rankeq1 ] ) is sup - contractive . in section 3 , we show that the general class of sup - contractive recurrence equations converges as desired . finally , in section 4",
    ", we return to the max - type equation ( [ maxeq ] ) , and find the value of the asymptotically convergent periodic orbit for some specific values of m and p.    sup - contractive functions the convergence proofs in the next section apply to a wide class of functions @xmath59 , that includes compositions of contractive functions as in ( [ alpha ] ) with the max and @xmath20-rank functions",
    ". we will be interested in the operator norm of functions @xmath60 , where the norm used is the sup norm .",
    "namely , assume there exists @xmath61 such that @xmath62 for all @xmath63 .",
    "we can think of @xmath64 as the lipschitz constant of @xmath60 in the sup norm , and will refer to it as the _ sup - lipschitz constant _ in the following sections .",
    "when @xmath65 we will call @xmath60 _ sup - non - expansive _ and when @xmath66 we will call @xmath60 _ sup - contractive_. note that a contraction on @xmath67 is sup - contractive since the infinity norm on @xmath67 is simply the absolute value .        for @xmath79 ,",
    "let @xmath80 be the function that returns the @xmath20-th largest entry of the @xmath18-dimensional input vector .",
    "customarily , @xmath81 is called the  @xmath20-rank \" function .",
    "it includes the @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xmath85 as special cases .",
    "not surprisingly , the max function is sup - non - expansive .",
    "somewhat more surprising is that this property holds for all @xmath20 , as shown in the next lemma .",
    "let @xmath86 , and assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath87 .",
    "set @xmath88 be the @xmath89-th largest component of @xmath90 and let @xmath91 be the @xmath89-th largest component of @xmath92 .",
    "then : @xmath93 now examine the list of natural numbers @xmath94 .",
    "we note that @xmath95 has length @xmath96 but each entry is chosen from @xmath97 .",
    "thus by the pigeonhole principle at least two of the listed numbers must be the same .",
    "note that all the @xmath98 are distinct and all the @xmath99 are distinct , thus there must be some @xmath100 and some @xmath101 such that @xmath102 .",
    "therefore @xmath103 which implies that @xmath104 since the absolute value is the infinity norm on @xmath67 , @xmath81 is sup - non - expansive",
    ".      [ supcompositions ] assume @xmath105 have sup - lipschitz constants less than @xmath106 and @xmath107 has sup - lipschitz constant @xmath108 , then @xmath109 has sup - lipschitz constant no larger than @xmath110 .",
    "note that if @xmath113 is sup - contractive , and all @xmath3 are sup - non - expansive then @xmath114 is sup - contractive . similarly if @xmath113 is sup - non - expansive , and all @xmath3 are sup - contractive then @xmath114 is sup - contractive .",
    "finally , the next lemma shows that if we bundle together functions into a vector , the sup - lipschitz constant can not grow .        note that if @xmath119 and @xmath66 then in fact @xmath120 is a contraction on @xmath121 , so bundling functions is a way to build contractions .",
    "finally , note that these statements could be generalized to allow @xmath3 to be vector valued but this is not necessary for what follows .",
    "general case we now return to our original recurrence equation @xmath122 under the assumption that each @xmath123 is a contraction",
    ". since @xmath124 is sup - non - expansive by lemma [ ranknonexp ] , and each @xmath3 is sup - contractive , the composition of the two is sup - contractive by lemma [ supcompositions ] .",

    "define a shift operator by @xmath183 .",
    "we will use the fact that @xmath170 is actually periodic of period @xmath13 to show that the function @xmath184 commutes with @xmath144 . note that @xmath185 first we examine the first component of @xmath186 : @xmath187 where the second equality comes from the fact that @xmath170 is periodic of period p. this shows that the first components of @xmath188 and @xmath186 are the same .",
    "we proceed inductively to show that all the components are the same .",
    "assume that @xmath189 for all @xmath190 .",
    "then : @xmath191 where we have again used the p - periodicity if @xmath170 to conclude @xmath192 .",

    "let @xmath181 be the unique fixed point of @xmath144 and define two sequences , the first with @xmath195 and the second with @xmath196 .",
    "note that @xmath197 since all initial conditions converge to @xmath181 , and at the same time : @xmath198 so we conclude that @xmath199 and thus @xmath181 is periodic of period @xmath13 .    [ mainresult ] let @xmath173 be sup - contractive and let @xmath174 for all @xmath10 .",
    "given an initial condition @xmath2 let @xmath175 then @xmath176 converges to a unique @xmath13-periodic orbit independent of initial conditions .",
    "we conclude that @xmath176 approaches a unique periodic orbit , for any initial condition , whose period is equal to the forcing period @xmath13 .",

    "recall that by lemma [ ranknonexp ] , the @xmath206 function is sup - non - expansive , and each @xmath207 is sup - contractive in @xmath203 so by lemma [ supcompositions ] , the composition is sup - contractive . by corollary [ mainresult ] , @xmath176 is asymptotically periodic of period p.

    "the closed - form solution to the autonomous contractive rank - type equation was first given in @xcite , and we are able to reprove this result as a special case .",
    "however , we will see that finding a closed formula for the limit under periodic forcing is in general more difficult .",
    "we will need two lemmas about contractions on @xmath67 .",
    "first , we can use lemma [ lem1 ] to find the explicit solution of the autonomous equation where each @xmath3 is a contraction with fixed point @xmath7 .",
    "the following result , first proved in @xcite , shows that every initial condition converges to the constant solution @xmath237 .",
    "note that this recurrence is autonomous and thus @xmath47 so by corollary [ rankresult ] every initial condition converges to a unique constant ( period one ) solution @xmath181 .",
    "thus it remains only to show that @xmath242 is a fixed point of the recurrence .",
    "let @xmath243 be a permutation such that : @xmath244 so the constant solution should be @xmath245 .",

    "similarly when @xmath252 we have @xmath253 so by lemma 3.1 we have @xmath254 .",
    "thus we have : @xmath255 thus @xmath248 so @xmath181 is a fixed point of the recurrence and therefore it is the unique limit for any initial condition .",
    "theorem [ periodone ] gives the complete solution to the rank - type equation in the period one case .",
    "we now turn to the case of period two forcing and restrict our attention to the max - type equation , for which it is possible to find a closed - form solution .",
    "this solution gives insight into the complexity of solutions to when the forcing period is large .",
    "for @xmath45 , the equation ( [ rankeq1 ] ) becomes the period two recurrence @xmath256 where @xmath257 and @xmath258 are contractions .",

    "this completes the justification of this table , and finishes the proof .",
    "[ ex44 ] we return to the equation from example [ ex1 ] with @xmath270 : @xmath271 where @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "we rewrite this equation by taking the natural log of each term ( since @xmath274 is monotonic ) to get @xmath275 in terms of theorem 4.2 we have : @xmath276 then the period two limit is defined in theorem 4.2 , and we can exponentiate to get the period two limit of @xmath176 .",
