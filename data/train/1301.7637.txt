    "exploring symmetry and its boundaries has been a driving force of the progress of mathematics already in ancient times with the platonic and archimedean solids being a prime example .",
    "regular maps and polytopes represent a modern + generalization of the platonic solids .",
    "they have a common feature , namely , that the group of automorphisms acts regularly on the set of elements , usually , called flags , that constitute the object under investigation .",
    "maps on closed surfaces may be completely described by trivalent edge - colored graph , known as the _ flag graph_. this is equivalent to the description proposed by lins in 1982 @xcite . for a modern treatment of the subject",
    "compare @xcite .",
    "the _ symmetry type graph _ of a map is a trivalent edge - colored factor of its flag graph obtained from the action of the group of automorphisms of the map on the flags .",
    "this notion is equivalent to the delaney - dress symbol described in @xcite .",
    "an application to mathematical chemistry is given in @xcite and a strategy of how to generate them is shown in @xcite . in the symmetry type graph , as it name says , one can find enough information in regard to symmetries of certain type of map .",
    "this graph is of our interest since it lets us know if the map is regular , transitive on either vertices , edges or faces , among other properties that will be studied through this paper .",
    "the _ medial _ of a map is a map that arises from a similar operation to the truncation on a map @xcite .",
    "this is one of the wythoffian constructions that can be performed on an arbitrary map on a surface . by wythoffian construction",
    ", we refer in particular to drop a perpendicular to the hypotenuse in a right - angle triangle , from the vertex in the right - angle ; in our case this triangle is a flag of the original map .",
    "the medial map is called  1-ambo \" by john conway @xcite .",
    "some of these wythoffian operations have been used in different contexts @xcite and were described by pisanski and itnik in a recent chapter 8 of @xcite .",
    "the medial operation can be described as subdivision of flag triangles ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "equivalently , we may describe this operation as rules transforming the flag graph of the original map to the flag graph of its medial , and work with its symmetry type graph .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : maps ] gives an introduction to maps , the dual and petrie - dual maps of a given map as well as to the medial operation .",
    "in section  [ sec : stg ] we develop the concept of the symmetry type graph of a map and enumerate all symmetry type graphs of maps with at most 5 flag orbits .",
    "moreover , we analyse how the dualities of a map work on its symmetry type graph to define the extended symmetry type graph of a self - dual map .",
    "we further enumerate all extended symmetry type graphs of self - dual maps with at most 7 flag orbits .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for further details .",
    "section  [ sec : med ] deals with how to obtain the symmetry type graph of the medial of a map , by operations on the ( extended ) symmetry type graph of the map .",
    "we enumerate all the medial symmetry type graphs with at most 7 vertices .",
    "in particular we show that every type of edge - transitive map is a medial type .",
    "we start this section by giving the basic theory of maps , their flag graphs and monodromy groups .",
    "we also review the concepts of duality and petrie - duality ; we introduce properly and improperly self - dual maps , as well as the medial operation on maps .",
    "we shall say that a _ map _ @xmath4 is a @xmath5-cellular embedding of a connected graph @xmath6 on a compact surface without boundary , in the sense that the graph separates the surface into simply connected regions .",
    "the vertices and edges of the map are the same as those of its underlying graph , and the faces of @xmath4 are described by some _",
    "distinguished closed walks _ of @xmath6 , in such a way that each edge of @xmath6 is in either exactly two distinguished cycles , or twice on the same one .",
    "( note that the distinguished cycles of @xmath6 can be identified with the simply connected regions obtained by removing the graph from the surface . )",
    "the set of vertices , edges and faces of @xmath4 will be denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . and",
    ", for convenience , we shall often refer to them as the @xmath10- , @xmath11- and @xmath5-faces of @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "a _ flag _ of a map is defined by an ordered triple @xmath12 of mutually incident vertex , edge and face of the map .",
    "the set of all flags of @xmath4 will be denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "we shall say that a map @xmath4 is _ equivelar _ if all its faces have the same number of edges ( say @xmath14 ) , and its vertices have the same valency ( say @xmath15 ) . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath4 has _ schfli type _",
    "@xmath16 .    by selecting one point in the interior of each @xmath17-face of @xmath4",
    ", one can identify a flag @xmath18 with the triangle with vertices @xmath19 , and the chosen interior points of @xmath20 and @xmath21 . by doing this with every flag of @xmath4",
    ", we obtain the _ barycentric subdivision _ @xmath22 of a map @xmath4 .",
    "hence , @xmath22 is a triangular map on the same surface , where its vertices correspond either to a vertex , the midpoint of an edge , or the chosen point in the interior of a face of @xmath4 .",
    "this gives a natural colouring on the vertex set of the barycentric subdivision , with colours @xmath23 , depending on whether the vertex of @xmath22 corresponds to a vertex , an edge or a face of @xmath4 .",
    "hence , each 2-face of the map @xmath4 is decomposed into triangles of @xmath22 , all of them having the same vertex of colour 2 .",
    "note that each triangle @xmath24 of @xmath22 shares an edge with exactly three other triangles that we shall denote by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where the triangles @xmath24 and @xmath27 share the vertices of colours @xmath28 and @xmath0 , but differ on that of colour @xmath17 .",
    "these triangles correspond to _ adjacent _ flags of @xmath4 , or more specifically , to _",
    "@xmath17-adjacent _ flags , if their corresponding triangles in @xmath22 differ exactly on the vertex of colour @xmath17 .",
    "we extend this notation by induction in the following way , @xmath29 and note that @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , for every flag @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , the connectivity of the underlying graph of @xmath4 implies that given any two flags @xmath24 and @xmath33 of @xmath4 , there exist integers @xmath34 such that @xmath35 .",
    "if for each flag of @xmath4 ( faces of @xmath22 ) we assign a vertex , and define an edge between two of them whenever the corresponding flags are adjacent , we obtain a new graph .",
    "we can naturally colour the edges of this graph with colours @xmath23 in such a way that the edge between any two @xmath17-adjacent flags has colour @xmath17 .",
    "the obtained @xmath36-edge - coloured graph is called the _ flag graph _",
    "@xmath37 of @xmath4 .",
    "( note that this trivalent graph with the vertex set @xmath13 defines the dual of the barycentric subdivision @xmath22 , in the sense of section [ dual ] . )    to each map @xmath4 we can associate a subgroup of the permutation group of the flags of @xmath4 in the following way .",
    "let @xmath38 be permutations of the set @xmath13 , acting on the right , such that for any flag @xmath39 , @xmath40 for each @xmath41 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that these permutations generate a group @xmath42 , called the _ monodromy ( or connection ) group _ of the map @xmath4 @xcite , and satisfy the following properties .",

    "the edges of a given colour form a perfect matching ( an independent set of edges containing all the vertices of the graph ) .",
    "hence the union of two sets of edges of different colour is a subgraph whose components are even cycles .",
    "such subgraph is called a _",
    "2-factor _ of @xmath37 .",

    "even more , two flags in the flag graph @xmath120 are 1-adjacent if and only if they are adjacent in the flag graph @xmath37 by @xmath44 ( by the definition of the petrie polygon ) . however , recall that a walk along the @xmath43 and @xmath44 edges of @xmath37 define a face of @xmath4 , but a face in @xmath119 corresponds to a zig - zag \" path in @xmath4 . hence ,",

    "therefore , there is a bijection , @xmath124 say , between the vertices of @xmath37 and the vertices of @xmath120 that preserves the colours 1 and 2 , and interchanges each ( 0,2)-path by an edge of colour 0 .",

    "hence , it is straightforward to see that the medial of a map @xmath4 and the medial of its dual @xmath96 are isomorphic .",
    "we note that every flag of the original map @xmath4 is divided into two flags of the medial @xmath128 .",

    "it is now easy to obtain the flag graph of @xmath128 from the flag graph of @xmath4 .",
    "an algorithm showing how to do this is indicated in figure  [ med - flag ] .",
    "in @xcite , hubard , orbani and weiss showed that the automorphism group of the medial map @xmath128 of a map @xmath4 is isomorphic to the extended group @xmath103 of @xmath4 , and used proper and improper self - dualities of the maps to characterize regular and 2-orbit medial maps , in terms of their symmetry type .",

    "weiss extended this to characterize the symmetry types of all medial maps of 2-orbit maps .",
    "they further proved that if @xmath4 is a @xmath0-orbit map , then @xmath128 is a @xmath0- or @xmath138-orbit map , depending on whether or not @xmath4 is a self - dual map .",

    "edges between vertices in the same orbit shall factor into semi - edges .",
    "the simplest symmetry type graph arrises from regular maps .",
    "in fact , the symmetry type graph of a regular map has only one vertex and three semi - edges , one of each colour @xmath146 and @xmath5 .",
    "recall that the edges of @xmath4 are represented by 4-cycles of alternating colours 0 - 2 in @xmath37 .",
    "each of these 4-cycles should then factor into one of the five pregraphs in figure  [ edges ] .        clearly , if @xmath4 is a @xmath0-orbit map , then @xmath139 has exactly @xmath0 vertices .",
    "thus , the number of types of @xmath0-orbit maps depends on the number of 3-valent pregraphs on @xmath0 vertices that can be properly edge coloured with three colours and that the connected components of the 2-factor with colours @xmath10 and @xmath5 are always as in figure  [ edges ] .",
    "it is then straightforward to see that there are exactly seven types of 2-orbit maps , shown in figure  [ twoorbit ] .",

    "have observed that the medial of any regular map must be edge - transitive ; in fact , in @xcite hubard , orbani and weiss showed that the medial of a regular map is either regular ( if the original map is self - dual ) or of type @xmath200 .",

    "several authors have been trying to determine the nature of edge - transitive maps that are medial maps , i.e. maps that are medials of other maps .",
    "for instance , lemma 2.2 in @xcite lists six symmetry types that can be edge - transitive medials of edge - transitive maps . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that there are , in fact , seven such symmetry types . in table 2 of @xcite the authors give 10 symmetry types of edge - transitive maps that may be medials of other , not necessarily edge - transitive maps .",
    "unfortunately , they miss the fact that four other edge - transitive types may also be medials .    in this section ,",
    "we make use of symmetry type graphs and extended symmetry type graph , and an operation on them to obtain medial symmetry type graphs .",
    "we further enumerate all the medial types with at most 7 vertices and show that indeed all edge - transitive types are medials .",
    "we shall say that a _ medial symmetry type graph _ is the symmetry type graph of a medial map , denoted by @xmath201 .",
    "in what follows we classify all medial symmetry type graphs with at most 7 vertices , that is , the possible symmetry type graphs of medial @xmath0-orbit maps , with @xmath3 . to this end",

    "if a map @xmath4 is not a self - dual map , we may think of the vertices of the medial symmetry type graph @xmath201 , as those obtained by two copies of the vertices of the symmetry type graph @xmath139 . as with the flag graph , given a vertex @xmath104 of @xmath139 we can write its corresponding two copies in @xmath201 as @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "note that the edges between these copies of the vertices of @xmath139 must respect the colour adjacency of the flags in the flag graph of @xmath128 .",
    "then , we can follow the same  standard \" algorithm shown in the figure [ med - flag ] to determine the adjacencies between the vertices of @xmath201 .",
    "in other words , the vertices @xmath204 and @xmath205 are adjacent by an edge of colour 2 ; for @xmath206 there is an edge of colour 0 between @xmath207 and @xmath208 if and only if @xmath104 and @xmath141 are adjacent by the colour 1 .",
    "finally , there is an edge of colour 1 between @xmath207 and @xmath208 if and only if @xmath104 and @xmath141 are adjacent by the colour 0 or 2 .",

    "on the other hand , when @xmath4 is a self - dual @xmath0-orbit map , to obtain its medial symmetry type graph with @xmath0 vertices , we first proceed as in the above paragraph and then take into consideration the extended symmetry type graph @xmath176 . in this case",
