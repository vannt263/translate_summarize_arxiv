    "the tool of quasar absorption line spectroscopy has several distinct advantages over more traditional imaging studies of distant galaxies .",
    "spectra covering absorption lines from numerous chemical elements in various states of ionization can yield detailed information about the physical conditions in the gaseous components of the universe .",
    "this is not limited to only the most luminous components .",
    "dwarf galaxies , low surface brightness galaxies , and even intergalactic structures are probed by quasar lines of sight .",
    "quasar absorption lines can be used to study gas during the birth and death of stars and of entire galaxies .",
    "the kinematic information contained in high resolution spectra allows us to study processes .",
    "this is not just a still picture snapshot ; it is more like a short movie . finally , the same level of detail is available for our study at all redshifts because the same method can be applied using optical and near  ir spectroscopy .",
    "however , the study of quasar absorption lines also presents some challenges if we are to extract from the quasar spectra all of the detailed information about physical conditions of gas .",
    "imagine if we had to classify a galaxy according to its standard morphological type by zooming in on an image of just a small part of the galaxy .",
    "we have to consider carefully what a single line of sight tells us about the global conditions in galaxies .",
    "in fact , it should be possible to learn a great deal if we consider the evolution of the ensemble of gaseous structures probed by quasar lines of sight . in order to realize this potential",
    ", we must learn to connect absorption signatures to the physical conditions of the phases of gas that produce them , and to the processes that give rise to such signatures in local galaxies .",
    "for the optimal study of the detailed physical conditions along a quasar line of sight we need high resolution spectroscopy covering all rest frame uv transitions . for redshifts",
    "less than one , a significant fraction of the key transitions still appear in the ultraviolet . in this",
    "proceedings , i review examples of various systems that have been studied in detail , focusing on the question of what additional data would yield a significant advance .",
    "the goal is to define capabilities for the optimal uv spectrograph and telescope to be used for such a program .",
    "the @xmath0 absorber toward the quasar pg1634 + 706 is a strong absorber , which implies that it is very likely to be within an impact parameter of @xmath1  kpc of an @xmath2 galaxy ( steidel 1995 ) .",
    "it is part of the small subset of absorbers that have particularly small absorption features , i.e. it is deficient relative to other strong absorbers ( churchill et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "stis / e230 m spectra of this quasar have been obtained by jannuzi and by burles , and hires / keck spectra ( covering , , and ) have been obtained by churchill and vogt ( 2001 ) .",
    "the most important transitions are shown in figure 1 .",
    "detailed results of our modeling of this system have been presented by ding et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the system can be described by a combination of a minimum of four different phases of gas .",
    "a phase is a region or regions with density and temperature within some range , spatially separate from other phases .",
    "the absorption arises in clouds that have densities of @xmath3  .",
    "the bulk of the absorption can not arise in the same clouds .",
    "instead , we propose that the is produced by small ( @xmath4  au ) , cool pockets of the interstellar medium .",
    "the metallicity of the and clouds is about @xmath5solar .",
    "a `` broad '' , low - metallicity ( @xmath6solar ) component is required to self  consistently fit , , and the higher  order lyman  series lines . the low metallicity could relate to why this absorber is deficient .",
    "finally , a strong , smooth absorption profile suggests an additional collisionally ionized phase with @xmath7  k , perhaps heated by shocks .    for this system , there are two outstanding issues of particular interest .",
    "first , with higher resolution ( @xmath8 ) we could test the narrow cloud hypothesis .",
    "second , an image of the host galaxy ( or those for similar systems ) would enable us to see whether an early  type galaxy is responsible for the lack of absorption resembling the milky way corona .",
    "the @xmath9 systems in the pg  @xmath10 line of sight are the subject of a separate contribution in this volume by jie ding , and therefore no detail or figures will be presented here .",
    "three distinct systems ( two strong and one weak ) are apparent at @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , an overall velocity spread of just over @xmath14  .",
    "this is likely to be a group of galaxies , with the three systems arising in three very different types of galaxy hosts .",
    "the study of these systems would be aided by higher @xmath15 since there are suggestions of abundance pattern variations .",
    "understanding of the phases giving rise to high ionization absorption would be much better constrained if a high resolution spectrum covering the transition was obtained .",
    "the @xmath16 absorber toward pg  @xmath17 is a multiple cloud , weak absorber , with two sets ( kinematic subsystems ) of low ionization `` clouds '' separated by @xmath18  .",
    "each of the subsystems has an absorption profile offset by @xmath19  .",
    "profiles for key transitions from the stis / hst and hires / keck spectra are shown in figure 2 .",
    "this system was modeled by zonak et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and the results are summarized here .",
    "the clouds have metallicity @xmath20solar , constrained by a partial lyman limit break .",
    "although has the same kinematic structure as in the stronger subsystem , the clouds appear to be offset by velocities ranging from @xmath21@xmath22  .",
    "this could be related to an region flow , but the interpretation of the multiple cloud structure remains unclear .",
    "the profile is smooth , but unsaturated , and is stronger than can be explained by the combination of the and cloud phases .",
    "this suggests a collisional ionization mechanism for producing .",
    "the profile requires two additional photoionized phases that can also produce the broad profiles .",
    "the low metallicity and the kinematics of the two subsystems suggest that two dwarf galaxies and their halos could be responsible .",
    "the lower ionization phases would arise in the inner regions of the dwarfs , and the offset higher ionization phases from their halos .",
    "very little is known about the expected absorption signature of dwarf galaxies .",
    "if quasar absorption line probes through nearby dwarfs were available , this mystery would be quickly solved . however",
    ", this would require that some fainter quasars were accessible for high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "figure 3 shows selected transitions for the three single  cloud , weak absorbers at @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 along the same quasar pg  @xmath17 line of sight . unlike the strong absorbers , single ",
    "cloud , weak absorbers are generally not found within @xmath26  kpc of @xmath27 galaxies .",
    "rigby , charlton , & churchill ( 2002 ) found , based on a larger sample for which lower resolution fos spectra were available , that they can not be far below solar metallicity .",
    "they also found that at least a subset of these absorbers are very small in dimension .",
    "detailed models of the three pg  @xmath17 single  cloud , weak absorbers were presented in charlton et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the @xmath24 weak absorber is the kinematically simplest along this line of sight .",
    "the absorption is relatively weak .",
    "it was not even detected in a low resolution fos spectrum .",
    "the profile constrains the metallicity to be supersolar , and the ionization conditions indicate that the low ionization phase is sub  parsec scale . despite the being weak , the broad shape of its profile",
    "can not be fit by the cloud .",
    "the high ionization phase could be collisionally ionized , but photoionization is more likely , with a cloud size of @xmath4  pc .",
    "the high ionization phase could surround or be surrounded by the low ionization gas .",
    "if the high ionization material is a thicker shell surrounding a small low ionization pocket then we would expect to see many systems with only the high ionization phase .",
    "a large statistical sample is needed to determine the geometry .",
    "to distinguish between collisional ionization and photoionization , coverage of the transition is key .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath25 weak absorber has relatively strong .",
    "a low ionization phase has supersolar metallicity and a cloud size of @xmath28  pc .",
    "the and require a separate , broader cloud , which is consistent with photoionization and not with collisional ionization .",
    "also , in this case , an additional offset high ionization cloud is required to fit the blue wing of the and the , which is not centered on the .",
    "the equivalent width could be large in this case partly because the line of sight passed through a separate cloud at a different velocity , and not because the centered cloud has special physical conditions .",
    "the profile associated with the @xmath23 weak absorber has distinct subcomponent structure , and therefore a large equivalent width . the is also quite strong for this system , possibly also because of the large kinematic spread",
    ". it is centered on the and not on the single component . the low ionization phase is poorly constrained , but its metallicity must exceed @xmath29solar .",
    "the three components arise in high ionization , kiloparsec ",
    "scale structures , which are likely to be photoionized .    what are these weak , single ",
    "cloud absorbers ?",
    "the small size constraints on the low ionization phases implies that there must be huge numbers of the host structures .",
    "in fact , to account for the observed number of weak , single ",
    "cloud absorbers , per unit redshift , there must be more than a million hosts for every @xmath27 galaxy in the universe .",
    "yet , these are not associated with @xmath27 galaxies .",
    "they appear to be self ",
    "enriched pockets of higher density material embedded in higher ionization , more diffuse gas .",
    "rigby et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) discuss the origin of the weak absorbers at length .",
    "their two most likely explanations are small traces of gas in fading remnants of population iii star clusters and fragments of supernova shells in faint blue dwarf galaxies .",
    "a number of new capabilities would help to constrain the properties of this intriguing class of object .",
    "double line of sight observations at a scale of parsecs , though they could not be done for many systems , would provide an essential check on size constraints for these weak absorbers .",
    "nearby weak absorbers must be identified so that narrow band imaging can be used to discover if hosts are dwarf galaxies or isolated star clusters . of course",
    ", a large statistical sample would clarify whether there are different classes of weak , single ",
    "cloud absorbers , with different types of hosts .",
    "the small sample of systems presented here demonstrates great promise for learning about the detailed physical conditions in a variety of gaseous environments . for these systems ,",
    "the data have some limitations and , as a result , some questions remain unanswered .",
    "these highlight the need for additional uv spectroscopy capabilities .",
