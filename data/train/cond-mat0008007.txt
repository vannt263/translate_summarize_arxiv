    "the amphiphilic nature of surfactant molecules results in their reversible self - assembling to form larger structures like spherical and cylindrical micelles , bilayers and vesicles .",
    "these supramolecular assemblies self - organise to form either long - range ordered liquid crystalline phases or short - range ordered isotropic liquid phases .",
    "some examples of ordered phases are the nematic ordering of micellar discs or rods , the smectic a phase formed from the one - dimensional packing of infinite lamellae , cubic phases formed by finite - size spherical micelles and two - dimensional hexagonal crystals formed by infinite cylindrical micelles . in recent years , bicontinuous cubic phases have been observed in which a continuous bilayer or a monolayer forms a periodic , saddle - shaped , minimum energy surface . in isotropic phases , microemulsions and sponge phases can form .",
    "another example is the formation of viscoelastic gels from the entanglement of very long and semiflexible cylindrical micelles with polymerlike behaviour .",
    "interestingly , these micelles break and rejoin , giving rise to the name wormlike micelles. the length distribution depends on the surfactant and the salt concentrations , temperature and the energy of scission of the micelles .",
    "the objective of this paper is to discuss our recent results on the nonlinear flow behaviour of such a system formed by the surfactant ctat ( cetyl trimethylammonium tosilate ) in water . at very low concentrations , ( @xmath5wt.% ) and above the kraft temperature of 23@xmath6c , ctat molecules in water self - assemble to form spherical micelles exhibiting newtonian flow . above 0.9wt.% ,",
    "ctat forms giant wormlike micelles .",
    "the hexagonal phase is seen at a ctat concentration of above 27wt.% @xcite .    in polymeric melts ,",
    "stress relaxation occurs primarily by reptation dynamics ( curvilinear diffusion of the polymeric chain along the contour of an imaginary tube enclosing the chain ) , as suggested by de gennes @xcite , which defines a relaxation time @xmath7 . in systems of giant wormlike micelles",
    ", there is an additional contribution to the stress relaxation from the reversible scission ( reversible breakage and recombination ) of micelles , which occurs on a time scale @xmath8 . if @xmath9 , then stress relaxation in wormlike micelles occurs mainly by reversible scission and is described well by the maxwell model which gives the response function g(t)=g@xmath10 , where g@xmath11 is the high frequency plateau modulus and @xmath12 is the relaxation time .",
    "the physical picture of the single relaxation time is a kind of motional narrowing @xcite .    the reptation reaction model of wormlike micelles , which gives the maxwell model for the linear viscoelasticity , yields unusual nonlinear rheology observed in some viscoelastic gels ( for example cetyl pyridinium chloride/ sodium salicylate ) @xcite .",
    "the flow curve is characterised by a plateau in the shear stress versus shear rate curve@xcite , while the normal stress is found to increase linearly with shear rate @xcite .",
    "these features in the flow curve of giant wormlike micellar systems are associated with a flow instability of the shear banding type , where the sheared solution breaks up into bands of high and low viscosities supporting low and high shear rates , respectively @xcite .",
    "flow birefringence @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance velocity imaging @xcite have revealed the existence of banded flow in the shear stress plateau regime .",
    "an alternate hypothesis explains the plateau in the shear stress as due to an isotropic - nematic phase transition that occurs due to the application of high shear rates to the sample @xcite .",
    "experiments on the transient rheology of cpycl - nacl after imposition of step shear rates , show overshoots , oscillations and long time sigmoidal kinetics in the shear stress @xmath13 @xcite . in our system of interest , ctat 1.9wt.% in water at 25@xmath6c , we do not observe any overshoots in the stress relaxation on application of shear rates lying in the plateau region of the flow curve .",
    "however , we see that at high shear rates , the stress instead of decaying to a steady state , oscillates in time for a long time .",
    "we have analysed the time series of the viscoelastic and normal stresses obtained from these experiments and have demonstrated the existence of deterministic , chaotic dynamics in sheared solutions of ctat .",
    "oscillations in the stress relaxation of ctat have also been observed by soltero et al at a concentration of 5wt.% @xcite .",
    "chaotic time series data have often been observed in experiments on fluid dynamics@xcite .",
    "the couette - taylor flow in fluids and the rayleigh - benard convection in gases are two examples .",
    "ananthakrishna et al @xcite have shown the existence of chaotic dynamics in the jerky flow ( portevin - le chatelier effect ) of some metal alloys undergoing plastic deformation .",
    "these systems also exhibit nonmonotonic flow curves .",
    "deterministic chaos represents the apparently irregular behaviour of dynamical systems that arises from strictly deterministic laws in the absence of any external stochasticity .",
    "chaotic dynamics in physical systems is characterised by an exponentially sensitive dependence on initial conditions , as a result of which long - term predictability of the dynamics of these systems is impossible .",
    "chaotic time series may be characterised by certain invariants , metric and dynamical , such as the various fractal dimensions , the largest lyapunov exponent and the kolmogorov entropy . a positive value of the largest lyapunov exponent is a direct consequence of the sensitivity of the trajectories in phase space to small changes in the initial conditions .",
    "the fractal dimensions provide a measurement of the topology of the attractor on which all the trajectories asymptotically converge . apart from describing the complexity of the attractor",
    ", they also provide a measure of the regularity of occurrence of the phase points on its surface @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will show the existence of a positive lyapunov exponent and a finite correlation dimension in the observed time series of the stress relaxation of ctat on application of step shear rates lying in the plateau region of the flow curve .",
    "further , the magnitudes of the invariants are found to increase monotonically with shear rate , the control parameter in our experiments .",
    "ctat ( purchased from sigma chemicals , india ) samples were prepared by dissolving 1.9wt.% of powdered ctat in distilled and deionised water .",
    "the samples were kept in an incubator at a temperature of 60@xmath6c for a week , and frequently shaken to facilitate homogenisation .",
    "the samples were then kept at the experimental temperature ( 25@xmath6c ) for two days .",
    "the rheological properties of the ctat thus prepared and equilibrated were measured using a rheolyst ar-1000n ( t. a. instruments , u. k. ) stress - controlled rheometer with temperature control and software for shear rate control .",

    "interestingly , the fit is reasonably good for experiments done at 35@xmath6c .",

    "we have ruled out the possibility of an isotropic - nematic phase transition on account of the very low volume fractions of ctat used in our experiments . at 35@xmath6c , the viscoelastic stress does not show a plateau region and the normal stress is roughly zero , which implies the absence of instability in sheared solutions of wormlike micelles at higher temperatures @xcite .",

    "this model , however , has not been analysed to predict the chaotic time - dependence of the stresses that is seen in our experiments .",
    "we believe that the flow - concentration coupling and the dynamics of the mechanical interfaces between shear bands need to be incorporated in the j - s model .",
    "further , the reversible breakdown and recombination of micelles also need to be considered . a model constructed by incorporating these additional features , which takes into account the nonlinear coupling between the relevant dynamical variables like shear and normal stress , shear rate and concentration profiles is likely to exhibit the chaotic behaviour that we observe .",
