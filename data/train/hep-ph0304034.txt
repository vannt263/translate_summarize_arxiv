    "the combined lep precision measurements  @xcite suggest the existence of a light higgs boson . in the case of a single standard model higgs",
    "boson the lhc promises multiple coverage for any higgs boson mass , which will enable us to measure its different decay modes and extract the couplings  @xcite . for a supersymmetric higgs sector",
    "this coverage has to rely on fewer higgs boson decay channels  @xcite .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the structure of the higgs sector : while the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) predicts a light higgs boson , it also predicts an enhancement of the coupling to down - type fermions , at the expense of the branching fractions to gauge bosons .",
    "this enhancement is an outcome from the two higgs doublet structure in the mssm : one doublet is needed to give mass to up - type , the other to down - type fermions .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets are different , parameterized by @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to a light scalar higgs boson , the two higgs doublet model includes a heavy scalar , a pseudoscalar , and a charged higgs boson .",
    "none of these additional particles have a mass bounded from above , apart from triviality or unitarity bounds .    of course",
    ", observables linked to properties of a light higgs boson can serve as a probe if a new scalar particle is indeed consistent with the standard model higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , only one way to conclusively tell the supersymmetric higgs sector from its standard model counterpart : to discover the additional heavy higgs bosons and determine their properties .    at the lhc ,",
    "the possible enhancement of down - type fermion yukawa couplings by powers of @xmath1 can render the search for a heavy scalar and pseudoscalar higgs boson promising . for small values of @xmath1 the yukawa coupling of the charged higgs boson is governed by the top quark mass @xmath2 , whereas for larger values of @xmath1 the bottom yukawa coupling @xmath3 dominates .",
    "while the chances of finding a heavy higgs boson with a small value of @xmath1 at the lhc are rather slim , the discovery of all heavy higgs scalars in the large @xmath4 regime is likely .",
    "this reflects the fact that the reach of the lhc for charged and neutral higgs bosons is to a large degree owed to scattering processes which involve incoming bottom quarks .",
    "the completely exclusive processes are @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes any neutral scalar higgs boson . from an experimental point of view , the identification of these final state bottom jets is tedious , because the dominant contribution comes from phase space configurations where the incoming gluons split into two collinear bottom quarks . the bottom quark rapidity distribution peaks at rapidities around two and the transverse momentum distributions around the bottom quark mass . after adding in the efficiency for a bottom tag",
    "this becomes a heavy price to pay in the analysis .",
    "therefore one usually prefers to look for more or less inclusive channels @xmath7 at this point we do not explicitly discuss the bottom  induced inclusive channels @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath9  @xcite , which are both known to next - to - leading order qcd , because their impact on the discovery potential of the lhc is not drastic .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our argument will hold for them the same way we apply it to the processes in eq.([eq : sig_incl ] ) .",
    "all bottom  inclusive channels suffer from an additional uncertainty : the choice of the factorization scale of the bottom parton .",
    "in contrast to the gluon density , the dependence of the bottom parton density on the factorization scale is large even for scales above @xmath10 .",
    "recently , it has been observed in higher order calculations  @xcite , that varying the bottom factorization scale around a smaller central value yields a more stable perturbative behavior .",
    "the same choice of scales can resolve the discrepancy between the total inclusive and exclusive rate , which is most prominent for the production channel @xmath11 .",
    "however , choosing scales according to perturbative behavior is difficult , because most processes include inherent cancellations between different contributions , and it is hard to define which contributions actually have to be stable . instead of this somewhat soft argument",
    ", we will derive an appropriate bottom factorization scale from the kinematics of the exclusive production process . in the following two sections",
    "we first investigate charged higgs boson production , because it involves only one incoming bottom quark and two heavy central decay products . in section  [ sec : others ] we will then generalize our result to neutral higgs boson production and compare it to single top quark production .    throughout this paper",
    "we show consistent leading order cross section predictions , including the respective one loop coupling constant , running heavy quark masses , and cteq parton densities . unless stated otherwise , we assume @xmath12 for all mssm processes .",
    "the exclusive cross sections are quoted with a massive @xmath13 bottom quark in the matrix element and the phase space , while the bottom yukawa coupling is set to the running bottom quark mass .",
    "heavy flavor  induced search channels for supersymmetric higgs bosons have been explored for many years  @xcite . to begin with the charged higgs boson",
    ", three search modes have been investigated : ( 1 ) charged higgs bosons can be pair produced in a drell  yan type process , mediated by a weak interaction vertex  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they can be pair produced at tree level in bottom quark scattering  @xcite or through a one loop amplitude in gluon fusion  @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) one charged higgs boson can be produced together with a @xmath14 boson via scattering of two bottom quarks or in gluon fusion  @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the charged higgs boson can be produced in association with a top quark , which seems to be the most promising search channel  @xcite .",
    "the charged higgs boson can be detected either decaying to a top and a bottom quark  @xcite or decaying to a tau lepton and a neutrino  @xcite .",
    "both lhc collaborations have tried to reproduce these phenomenological analyses , most successfully in the case of the decay to tau leptons  @xcite .",
    "however , these analyses have to be taken with a grain of salt , if they rely on the standard monte carlo generators , because some do not include a running bottom yukawa coupling . from the next - to - leading order qcd calculations  @xcite we know that using the bottom pole mass as the yukawa coupling severely overestimates the rates , as one would expect from what we know about higgs boson decays to bottom quarks .    the case of neutral scalar higgs bosons in the mssm has been discussed in similar detail . in the standard model",
    "the inclusive production process @xmath15 is a small correction to the inclusive gluon fusion channel  @xcite . in a supersymmetry context , and in particular for large @xmath1 , the bottom quark ",
    "induced process dominates gluon fusion  @xcite .",
    "the typical higgs decays are the same as for a light standard model higgs boson , except for heavy mssm scalars , where decays to muon or tau pairs are most promising  @xcite .",
    "additional problems occur in the so - called intense coupling regime , _ i.e._the region with an intermediate pseudoscalar higgs boson mass and strong mixing effects  @xcite . the two scalar higgs bosons can be detected and possibly be resolved in weak boson fusion with a subsequent decay to @xmath16 pairs  @xcite ; unfortunately , for large values of @xmath1 the mass splitting becomes too small to distinguish the two mass peaks . in that region ,",
    "the most promising way to search for and separate the heavy higgs states is the production process involving @xmath17 jets with the higgs bosons decaying to muons  @xcite . to distinguish the gluon fusion process from the bottom quark  induced production , one can require observation of only one final state bottom quark , _ i.e._using the partly inclusive channel @xmath18  @xcite .    motivated by this vast number of analyses in the mssm higgs sector we turn to the simplest process available : charged higgs boson production in association with a top quark involves only one incoming bottom quark and is an appropriate starting point to understand the issue of bottom partons at the lhc .",
    "the features of the exclusive and the inclusive charged higgs boson production process @xmath19 have been investigated in detail in ref .",
    "let us briefly review the most important observations :    for reasons described above , the searches for charged higgs bosons ( decaying to tau leptons ) at the lhc usually do not require the observation of a final state bottom quark .",
    "the exclusive process @xmath20 is then dominated by collinear splitting of one of the gluons into a bottom quark pair : @xmath21 \\label{eq : excl_asymp}\\ ] ] these logarithms in the total cross section can be resummed , which is precisely the definition of bottom partons  @xcite .",
    "the factorization scale of the bottom partons is defined as the maximum transverse bottom quark momentum up to which the asymptotic form of the cross section is assumed to hold , and up to which the logarithms @xmath22 are then resummed .",
    "this means that in eq.([eq : excl_asymp ] ) one can identify @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "if we assume @xmath25 , which as we will see is true for all processes we consider , the numerical value for the bottom quark mass will have no impact on our argument  we could neglect it altogether  @xcite .",
    "the factorization scale is _ per se _ an artificial parameter which has to vanish after including all orders of perturbation theory . in the case of neutral higgs boson production @xmath26",
    "this has recently been demonstrated , including the nnlo qcd corrections  @xcite .",
    "we are lucky in the case of bottom quarks : the comparison between the actual and the asymptotic form of the _ exclusive _ cross section allows us to estimate @xmath27 and therefore the bottom parton factorization scale for the _ inclusive _ process .",
    "this also tells us how large the ` large logarithms ' , which are resummed using bottom parton densities , actually are .",
    "there are two caveats to be kept in mind , though .",
    "first , the inclusive process @xmath28 assumes that the entire cross section comes from a phase space region in which we can neglect the transverse momentum of the bottom jet appearing in the exclusive process @xmath29 .",
    "this is probably a good approximation , in particular after including detector effects , but one has to be aware of it .",
    "second , naive dimensional analysis suggests @xmath30 , which is often used .",
    "this does not have to be correct .",
    "the only thing dimensional analysis tells us is @xmath31 , as long as the production process is dominated by the threshold region .",
    "it has been shown that the proportionality factor does not at all have to be unity and that a wrong choice of scale leads to a systematic overestimate of the cross section , as it is obvious from eq.([eq : excl_asymp ] )  @xcite .",
    "normalized distributions for the hadronic charged higgs boson production @xmath32 . left : difference between the invariant mass of the @xmath33 system and its threshold mass @xmath34 . right : ratio of the longitudinal and transverse momentum of the bottom jet @xmath35 in the parton center - of - mass system .",
    "the steeper set of curves is after a cut @xmath36.,width=529 ]    to make our argument as transparent as possible , we will investigate the relation between the bottom factorization scale and the threshold mass in two steps .",
    "the threshold mass we will refer to as @xmath37 ; for the charged higgs boson production process this means @xmath38 . we can generally rewrite the exclusive and the inclusive production processes including one bottom parton as @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the heavy final state particles . for a typical gluon",

    ", we investigate the maximum value for the intermediate bottom quark virtuality @xmath44 , up to which the asymptotic form of the exclusive cross section holds @xmath45    in section  [ sec : plateau_pt ] , we then estimate how far the asymptotic form in terms of the bottom transverse momentum is valid . from ref .",
    "@xcite we expect a relation @xmath46 . if we assume that this reduction will consist of the suppression from the asymptotic behavior in the virtuality and an additional suppression when we move to the asymptotic behavior in the transverse momentum , we obtain @xmath47    to understand the asymptotic behavior of the hadronic cross section @xmath48 as a function of the bottom quark virtuality , we rewrite the integration over the phase space and the parton momentum fractions  @xcite . as long as we are interested in the behavior of the cross section for large values of the rapidity we can safely neglect the bottom quark mass : @xmath49    here @xmath50 is the intermediate bottom quark virtuality , @xmath51 the rapidity , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the hadronic and partonic collider energies .",

    "it is normalized to match the curve for the physical bottom quark mass for large virtuality .",
    "the curves are ordered on their downward slopes by decreasing final state mass towards larger values of @xmath44 and @xmath23.,width=529 ]      in the previous sections we derived the appropriate bottom parton factorization scale for the associated production of a charged higgs boson and a top quark . for different reasons this process is particularly well suited for the bottom parton description : there is only one bottom parton , the top ",
    "higgs system is very heavy , it will be produced close to threshold , and ( for those reasons ) it will be slow - moving and central in the detector .",
    "a process which is particularly important for light as well as for heavy supersymmetric higgs bosons is the production of a neutral scalar in association with two bottom quarks , which at the different level of inclusive versus exclusive description reads  @xcite : @xmath156    a phenomenological interesting aspect is that these kind of channels with at least one tagged bottom jet  @xcite can prove an enhanced bottom yukawa coupling .",
    "we know that just like in the charged higgs boson case , the factorization scale of the bottom parton has to be chosen well below @xmath157  @xcite .",
    "the first reason is that again a heavy system ( @xmath158 ) is produced close to threshold , fig .",
    "[ fig : para_others ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] we show the plateau in @xmath90 , similarly to the figures in ref .",
    "@xcite , and obtain @xmath95 . like for the charged higgs boson case",
    "we see that the curves are nearly degenerate for different higgs boson masses , _",
    "i.e._@xmath159 . for the neutral higgs bosons an additional curve",
    "is included in fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] , assuming a @xmath155 light scalar mssm higgs boson . in this case",
    "the plateau is not particularly wide , since the bottom mass effects bend down the curves at fairly large values of @xmath92 . on the other hand ,",
    "these effects are understood , so that the altered shape can be treated just like a plateau .",
    "moreover , the dominant effects will arise from the upper end of the curve , where the logarithms are largest .    comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : bth ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] , we see that the extension of the asymptotic behavior in the bottom quark virtuality at the lhc is just the same for charged higgs boson production ( @xmath160 ) as for neutral higgs boson production ( @xmath161 ) , for similar heavy state masses .",
    "an aspect we did not discuss in the charged higgs boson case is that the plateau seems to extend to slightly larger virtualities for smaller threshold masses , in particular for a @xmath155 neutral higgs boson .",
    "the reason is that , in general , @xmath40 will be produced relatively closer to threshold for heavier states , _",
    "i.e._@xmath162 becomes smaller , even though fig .",
    "[ fig : para_bth ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : para_others ] show that in absolute numbers @xmath41 becomes slightly larger for heavier states @xmath40 .    up to this point",
    "we did not have to specify the collider energy in our approximation .",
    "moreover , charged higgs boson production is only relevant at the lhc .",
    "the distributions for neutral higgs boson production at the tevatron are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : tev ] .",
    "while for small higgs boson masses of @xmath155 the bottom quark virtuality plateau looks very similar to corresponding curves for the lhc , our picture starts to break down for very large higgs boson masses . in that case",
    "the limited hadronic collider energy does not allow production of heavy states plus a bottom jet with sizeable virtuality / transverse momentum .",
    "of course , the case of a @xmath78 higgs boson at the tevatron is phenomenologically irrelevant . on the other hand , we learn that implicitly we have used another approximation in our discussion of the lhc processes : that the production rate even for large virtuality is limited only by the parton densities and the parton energy , never by the hadronic collider energy .",
    "implicitly we check this requirement in fig .",
    "[ fig : bth ] , when we confirm @xmath163 after neglecting the effect of parton densities .",
    "last but not least , the question is what will happen for the completely inclusive higgs boson production ( @xmath11 ) ?",
    "from ref .",
    "@xcite we know that the argument for the plateau in @xmath90 works just the same way as before , except that we now use the semi - exclusive process @xmath164 to compute @xmath44 . using the approximation described in section  [ sec : plateau_q ] we understand what happens : the mass of the heavy system is still @xmath165 , but the gluon which splits into a bottom quark pair now sees a bottom parton on the other side instead of the gluon in the completely exclusive process . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumis ] we see that the approximations @xmath166 and @xmath167 still work fine . in a way",
    "this is a consistency check , of course .",
    "a significant change in the behavior of the bottom partons between the first bottom jet and the second bottom jet to be integrated over in the process @xmath168 would pose a serious problem for factorization in general .",
    "this result is in very good agreement with the results of the nnlo qcd calculation for this process : the small bottom quark factorization scale indeed yields perturbative corrections which are well under control  @xcite .",
    "the second step is again the transition from the plateau in virtuality to that in transverse momentum .",
    "not surprisingly , from the exclusive process we numerically find the same behavior as for the charged higgs boson , fig .",
    "[ fig : bth ] .",
    "our argument in section  [ sec : plateau_pt ] also works just the same way for neutral higgs bosons . from the exclusive process we numerically find @xmath169 , which we can understand in complete analogy to the charged higgs boson case in the previous sections .",
    "in contrast to the higgs boson production mechanisms , the bottom parton picture in single top quark production  @xcite @xmath170 has never posed a problem .",
    "the difference between the two above processes is that the first one will involve valence quarks at the lhc , while the second one will not . looking back , fig .",
    "[ fig : lumis ] shows that these channels should look slightly different , if our argument in section  [ sec : plateau_q ] is correct .    in the left column in fig",
    "[ fig : others ] we see how the single top quark case differs from the higgs boson production . first of all , the plateau in the virtuality extends considerably further , typically to @xmath171 .",
    "this is in agreement with the less steep parton densities for the quarks , which the splitting gluon sees .",
    "if we have a closer look , we even see that the plateau extends further in the case of an incoming valence quark than for a sea quark , which is in agreement with the approximate parton densities , fig .",
    "[ fig : lumis ] .    however , our approximation has to be looked at with some care , since now we can not assume @xmath167 anymore .",
    "furthermore , in fig .  [",
    "fig : para_others ] we see that the single top quark production does not at all happen close to threshold .",
    "it peaks around @xmath172 , which reflects the fact that one could integrate over the phase space of the outgoing jet and regard the single top quark process as @xmath173 scattering .",
    "this gives the outgoing jet a transverse momentum kick of the order of the @xmath14 boson mass .",
    "the fact that the invariant mass of the heavy system @xmath174 , as it appears in eq.([eq : cxn2 ] ) , is easily twice the threshold mass , again contributes to the larger values of @xmath44 .",
    "finally , as discussed in the context of neutral higgs bosons , production away from threshold lifts the degeneracy of different values of @xmath175 , pushing the lighter states to higher values of @xmath176 .",
    "we will not discuss the transition from the bottom quark virtuality to the transverse momentum in any detail . from fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] we see that the plateau is softened and @xmath177 , as in all other processes discussed before : the interpolation argument presented in section  [ sec : plateau_pt ] describes the single top quark production perfectly well .",
    "this part of our argument indeed holds independently for all processes considered in this paper .",
    "recently , a similar issue of bottom partons was discussed  @xcite in the framework of single top quark production at a linear collider @xmath178 .",
    "the authors find sizeable differences between the finite @xmath179 prediction and the ( massless ) structure function approach , predominantly close to threshold @xmath180 .",
    "these differences can in part be traced back to phase space effects . from fig .  [",
    "fig : para_bth ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : para_others ] we see that this region of phase space contributes little to the higgs boson sample at the lhc , after we convolute the partonic cross section with the gluon densities , integrating over the entire partonic energy range .",
    "it will have even less impact on the total rate once a minimum transverse momentum of the higgs boson decay products is required . while for a linear collider the bottom quark mass is an important source of theoretical uncertainty and the collinear logarithms ( multiplied with @xmath181 ) are under control , the dominant problem at hadron colliders is the size of the logarithms ( multiplied with @xmath182 ) , which we link to the transverse momentum spectrum in the exclusive processes .",
    "starting from charged higgs boson production in association with a top quark , we have investigated processes which can be described using bottom partons . from the kinematics of the exclusive processes",
    ", we numerically find that the factorization scale of the bottom parton has to be smaller than the threshold mass or the hard scale in the process : @xmath169 . in two steps",
    "we first investigate the validity of the asymptotic approximation in the bottom quark virtuality and then in the transverse momentum .",
    "the upper limit @xmath23 , for which the exclusive cross section is dominated by collinear bottom quarks and large logarithms @xmath183 , defines the appropriate value for the factorization scale of the bottom parton in the inclusive process .",
    "we derive the observed dramatic decrease in the factorization scale as compared to the hard scale @xmath37 in a process - independent approach , using only properties of the phase space and of the parton densities . in this simple picture",
    "we indeed find @xmath184 .",
    "this observation resolves the puzzle of the discrepancy between inclusive and exclusive rates , as it has been present in the literature . using an appropriate scale , the difference for example for the process @xmath15",
    "@xcite is not huge and well understood .",
    "moreover , higher order calculations have been pointing to small bottom factorization scales  @xcite ; we understand how this is caused by the partonic phase space without relying on numerical arguments based on higher order corrections .",
    "turning around the argument , we can specify how large the logarithms actually are , which are resummed in the bottom parton picture .",
    "again , they are smaller than the naive guess @xmath185 would indicate .",
    "in particular , for a light neutral higgs boson one can debate using the ( resummed ) bottom parton cross section , or just integrating over the exclusive cross section  @xcite . for",
    "heavier neutral or charged higgs bosons the logarithms are certainly large enough to require a resummation .",
