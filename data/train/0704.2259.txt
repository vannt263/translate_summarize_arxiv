    "the study of secure communication from an information theoretic perspective was pioneered by shannon  @xcite . in shannon s model , both the sender and the destination possess a common secret key @xmath1 , which is unknown to the wiretapper , and use this key to encrypt and decrypt the message @xmath2 .",
    "shannon considered a scenario where both the legitimate receiver and the wiretapper have direct access to the transmitted signal and introduced the perfect secrecy condition @xmath3 , implying that the signal @xmath4 received by the wiretapper does not provide any additional information about the source message @xmath2 . under this model",
    ", he proved the pessimistic result that the achievability of perfect secrecy requires the entropy of the shared private key @xmath1 to be at least equal to the entropy of the message itself ( i.e. , @xmath5 for perfect secrecy ) .",
    "clearly , the distribution of the secret key under this model is challenging .    in a pioneering work",
    "@xcite , wyner introduced the wiretap channel and established the possibility of creating an almost perfectly secure source - destination link without relying on private ( secret ) keys . in the wiretap channel ,",
    "both the wiretapper and destination observe the source encoded message through noisy channels .",
    "similar to shannon s model , the wiretapper is assumed to have unlimited computational resources .",
    "wyner showed that when the source - wiretapper channel is a degraded version of the source - destination channel , the source can send perfectly secure messages to the destination at a non - zero rate .",
    "the main idea is to hide the information stream in the additional noise impairing the wiretapper by using a stochastic encoder which maps each message to many codewords according to an appropriate probability distribution .",
    "this way , one induces maximal equivocation at the wiretapper . by ensuring that the equivocation rate is arbitrarily close to the message rate",
    ", one achieves perfect secrecy in the sense that the wiretapper is now limited to learn _ almost nothing _ about the source - destination messages from its observations .",
    "follow - up work by leung - yan - cheong and hellman has characterized the secrecy capacity of the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) wiretap channel  @xcite . in a landmark paper , csisz@xmath6r and krner generalized wyner s approach by considering the transmission of confidential messages over broadcast channels  @xcite .",
    "this work characterized the perfect secrecy capacity of discrete memoryless channels ( dmc)s , and showed that the perfect secrecy capacity is positive unless the source - wiretapper channel is _ less noisy _ than the source - destination channel ( referred to as the main channel in the sequel ) , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the signal transmitted by the source , and where @xmath9 and @xmath4 are the received signal at the receiver and the wiretapper respectively . ] .",
    "positive secrecy capacity is not always possible to achieve in practice .",
    "in an attempt to transmit messages securely in these unfavorable scenarios , @xcite and @xcite considered the wiretap channel with * noiseless * feedback .",
    "they showed that one may leverage the feedback to achieve a positive perfect secrecy rate , even when the feed - forward perfect secrecy capacity is zero . in this model",
    ", there exists a separate noiseless public channel , through which the transmitter and receiver can exchange information .",
    "the wiretapper is assumed to obtain a perfect copy of the messages transmitted over this public channel .",
    "upper and lower bounds were derived for the perfect secrecy capacity with noiseless feedback in  @xcite . in several cases , as discussed in detail in the sequel , these bounds coincide .",
    "but , in general , the perfect secrecy capacity with noiseless feedback remains unknown .",
    "along the same line , @xcite established the critical role of a trusted / untrusted helper in enhancing the secret key capacity of public discussion algorithms .",
    "the multi - terminal generalization of the basic set - up of @xcite was studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , in  @xcite , the public discussion paradigm was extended to handle the existence of active adversaries .",
    "our work represents a marked departure from the public discussion paradigm . in our model",
    ", we do not assume the existence of a separate noiseless feedback channel .",
    "instead , the feedback signal from the destination , which is allowed to depend on the signal received so far , is transmitted over the same noisy channel used by the source .",
    "based on the noisy feedback signal , the source can then causally adapt its transmission scheme , hoping to increase the perfect secrecy rate .",
    "the wiretapper receives a mixture of the signal from the source and the feedback signal from the destination .",
    "quite interestingly , we show that in the modulo - additive dmc with a full - duplex destination , the perfect secrecy capacity with noisy feedback equals the capacity of the main channel in the absence of the wiretapper .",
    "furthermore , the capacity is achieved with a simple scheme where the source ignores the feedback signal and the destination feeds back randomly generated symbols from a certain alphabet set .",
    "this feedback signal plays the role of a private key , known only by the destination , and encryption is performed by the modulo - additive channel . the more challenging scenario with a half - duplex destination , which can not transmit and receive simultaneously ,",
    "is considered next . here",
    ", the active transmission periods by the destination will introduce erasures in the feed - forward source - destination channel . in this setting",
    ", we propose a novel feedback scheme that achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate for any non - trivial channel distribution .",
    "the feedback signal in our approach acts as a private _ destination only _ key which strikes the optimal tradeoff between introducing erasures at the destination and errors at the wiretapper .",
    "finally , the proposed scheme is extended to the continuous modulo-@xmath0 lattice channel where it is shown to achieve the capacity of the main channel .",
    "overall , our work proposes a novel approach for encryption where 1 ) the feedback signal is used as a private key known only to the destination and 2 ) the encryption is performed by exploiting the modulo - additive property of the channel .",
    "this encryption approach is shown to be significantly superior to the classical public discussion paradigm .",
    "recently , there has been a resurgent interest in studying secure communications from information theoretic perspective under various scenarios .",
    "the point - to - point fading eavesdropper channel was considered in  @xcite under different assumptions on the delay constraints and the available transmitter channel state information ( csi ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "the information theoretic limits of secure communications over multiple access channels were explored .",
    "the relay channel with confidential messages , where the relay acts both as a wiretapper and a helper , was studied in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the interference channel with confidential messages was studied . in  @xcite ,",

    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are allowed to be correlated , while each process is assumed to be individually drawn from an identically and independently distributed source .",

    "i.e. _ , we do not assume the existence of a separate noiseless feedback channel .",

    "more specifically , these papers considered a more general model in which all the nodes observe correlated variables , and there exists an extra noiseless public channel with infinite capacity , through which both the source and the destination can send information . combining the correlated variables and the publicly discussed messages , the source and the destination generate a key about which the wiretap only has negligible information .",
    "please refer to  @xcite for rigorous definitions of these notions .",
    "since the public discussion channel is noiseless , the wiretapper is assumed to observe a noiseless version of the information transmitted over it .",
    "it is worth noting that some of the schemes proposed in  @xcite manage only to generate an identical secret key at both the source and destination .",
    "the source may then need to encrypt its message using the one - time pad scheme which reduces the effective source - destination information rate .",
    "thus , the _ effective _ secrecy rate that could be used to transmit information from the source to the destination _ may _ be less than the results reported in  @xcite .",

    "this completes the proof .",
    "the following observations are now in order .    1",
    ".   our scheme achieves @xmath115 .",
    "this implies perfect secrecy in the strong sense of shannon  @xcite as opposed to wyner s notion of perfect secrecy  @xcite , which has been pointed out to be insufficient for certain encryption applications  @xcite .",
    "the enabling observation behind our achievability scheme is that , by judiciously exploiting the modulo - additive structure of the channel , one can render the channel output at the wiretapper independent from the codeword transmitted by the source .",
    "here , the feedback signal @xmath92 serves as a private key and the encryption operation is carried out by the channel . instead of requiring both the source and destination to know a common encryption key ,",
    "we show that only the destination needs to know the encryption key , hence eliminating the burden of secret key distribution .",
    "remarkably , the secrecy capacity with _ noisy _",
    "feedback is shown to be larger than the secret key capacity of public discussion schemes .",
    "this point will be further illustrated by the binary symmetric channel example discussed next .",
    "this presents a marked departure from the conventional _ wisdom _ , inspired by the data processing inequality , which suggests the superiority of noiseless feedback .",
    "this result is due to the fact that the noiseless feedback signal is also available to the wiretapper , while in the proposed noisy feedback scheme neither the source nor the wiretapper knows the feedback signal perfectly .",
    "in fact , the source in our scheme ignores the feedback signal , which is used primarily to _ confuse _ the wiretapper .",
    "our result shows that complicated feedback functions @xmath32 are not needed to achieve optimal performance in this setting ( i.e. , a random number generator suffices ) .",
    "also , the alphabet size of the feedback signal can be set equal to the alphabet size of the wiretapper channel and the coding scheme used by the source is the same as the one used in the absence of the wiretapper .",
    "to illustrate the idea of encryption over the channel , we consider in some details the wiretap bsc shown in figure  [ fig : bsc ] , where @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 . the secrecy capacity of this channel without feedback",
    "is known to be  @xcite @xmath119^+,\\ ] ] with @xmath120 .",
    "we differentiate between the following special cases .    1 .",
    "+ in this case , both the main channel and wiretap channel are noiseless , hence @xmath122 also we have @xmath123 since the wiretapper sees exactly the same as what the destination sees .",
    "specializing our scheme to this bsc channel , at time @xmath14 , the destination randomly chooses @xmath124 with probability 1/2 and sends @xmath125 over the channel .",
    "this creates a virtual bsc at the wiretapper with @xmath126 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the destination knows the value of @xmath125 , it can cancel it by adding @xmath125 to the received signal .",
    "this converts the original channel to an equivalent bsc with @xmath127 .",
    "hence , through our noisy feedback approach , we obtain an equivalent wiretap bsc with parameters @xmath128 resulting in @xmath129 2 .",
    "@xmath130 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent .",
    "+ since @xmath131 , we have @xmath122 also , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent , so @xmath64 .",
    "then from  , one can easily obtain that  @xcite @xmath132 + our feedback scheme , on the other hand , achieves @xmath133 since @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 with equality if and only if @xmath136 .",

    "more strongly , the gain offered by the noisy feedback approach , over the public discussion paradigm , is rather significant in many relevant special cases .",
    "it is reasonable to argue against the _ practicality _ of the full duplex assumption adopted in the previous section .",
    "for example , in the wireless setting , nodes may not be able to transmit and receive with the same _ degree of freedom _ due to the large difference between the power levels of the transmit and receive chains .",
    "this motivates extending our results to the half duplex wiretap channel where the terminals can either transmit or receive but never both at the same time . under this situation ,",
    "if the destination wishes to feed back at time @xmath14 , it loses the opportunity to receive the @xmath151 symbol transmitted by the source , which effectively results in an erasure ( assuming that the source is unaware of the destination decision ) .",
    "the proper feedback strategy must , therefore , strike a balance between confusing the wiretapper and degrading the source - destination link . in order to simplify the following presentation , we first focus on the wiretap bsc . the extension to arbitrary modulo - additive channels",
    "is briefly outlined afterwards .    in the full - duplex case , at any time @xmath14 , the optimal scheme is to let the destination send @xmath125 , which equals @xmath152 or @xmath153 with probability 1/2 respectively .",
    "but in the half - duplex case , if the destination always keeps sending , it does not have a chance to receive information from the source , and hence , the achievable secrecy rate is zero .",
    "this problem , however , can be solved by observing that if at time @xmath14 , @xmath154 , the signal the wiretapper receives , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath155 is the same as in the case in which the destination does not transmit .",
    "the only crucial difference in this case is that the wiretapper does not know whether the feedback has taken place or not , since @xmath125 can be randomly generated at the destination and kept private .",
    "the previous discussion inspires the following feedback scheme for the half - duplex channel .",
    "the destination first fixes a faction @xmath156 which is revealed to both the source and wiretapper . at time @xmath14 , the destination randomly generates @xmath124 with probability @xmath157 and @xmath154 with probability @xmath158 . if @xmath124 , the destination sends @xmath125 over the channel , which causes an erasure at the destination and a potential error at the wiretapper . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath154 , the destination does not send a feedback signal and spends the time on receiving from the channel .",
    "the key to this scheme is that although the source and wiretapper know @xmath157 , neither is aware of the exact timing of the event @xmath159 .",
    "the source ignores the feedback and keeps sending information .",
    "the following result characterizes the achievable secrecy rate with the proposed feedback scheme .    for a bsc with half - duplex nodes and parameters",

    "if the destination spends a @xmath157 fraction of its time on sending , the equivalent main channel is shown in figure  [ fig : halfmaineq ] with output @xmath164 , where @xmath165 represents an erasure .",
    "the erasure probability is @xmath157 . in the remaining @xmath158 fraction of the time",

    "the destination can set @xmath89 , and generates @xmath125 with certain distribution @xmath182 . at time @xmath14 , if the randomly generated @xmath183 , the destination sends a feedback signal , incurring an erasure to itself . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath154 , it does not send the feedback signal and spends the time listening to the source .",
    "the achievable performance could be calculated based on the equivalent channels as done in the bsc .",
    "this scheme guarantees a positive secrecy capacity as seen in the case where @xmath182 is chosen to be uniformly distributed over @xmath184 .",
    "this is because a uniform distribution over @xmath184 renders the output at the wiretapper independent from the source input , i.e. , @xmath185 , while the destination can still spend @xmath91 part of the time listening to the source .",
    "finding the optimal distribution @xmath182 , however , is tedious .",
    "in this section , we take a step towards extending our approach to continuous valued channels . in particular , we consider the modulo-@xmath0 channel  @xcite .",
    "this choice is motivated by two considerations 1 ) this channel still enjoys the _ modulo _ structure which proved instrumental in deriving our results in the discrete case , and 2 ) the modulo-@xmath0 channel has been shown to play an important role in achieving the capacity of the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel using lattice coding / decoding techniques  @xcite ( in other words , an awgn source - destination channel can be well approximated by a modulo-@xmath0 channel ) . in the following , we show that , similar to the discrete case , noisy feedback can increase the secrecy capacity of the wiretap modulo-@xmath0 channel to that of the main channel capacity in the absence of the wiretapper .    before proceeding further , we need to introduce few more definitions .",
    "an @xmath186-dimensional lattice @xmath187 is a set of points @xmath188 where @xmath189 denotes the lattice generator matrix .",
    "a fundamental region @xmath190 of @xmath0 is a set such that each @xmath191 can be written uniquely in the form @xmath192 with @xmath193 , and @xmath194 .",
    "there are many different choices of the fundamental region , each with the same volume which will be denoted as @xmath195 . given a lattice @xmath0 , a fundamental region @xmath196 of @xmath0 , and a zero - mean white gaussian noise process with variance @xmath197 per dimension , the mod-@xmath0 channel is defined as follows  @xcite .",
    "the input of the mod-@xmath0 channel consists of points @xmath198 ; the output of the mod-@xmath0 channel is @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is an @xmath186-dimensional white gaussian noise variable with variance @xmath197 per dimension .",
    "hence @xmath201 is the unique element of @xmath196 that is congruent to @xmath202 .    in our wiretap mod-@xmath0 channel ,",
    "the output at the wiretapper ( in the absence of feedback ) is also given by @xmath203 . here",
    "@xmath204 is an @xmath186-dimensional white gaussian noise variable with variance @xmath205 per dimension .",
    "similar to section  [ sec : model ] , we consider noisy feedback , where the destination sends a feedback signal @xmath206 based on its received signal , and the received signal at the source is @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is an @xmath186-dimensional white gaussian noise with variance @xmath209 per dimension .",
    "now , the received signal at the destination and wiretapper are @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "for example , if @xmath212 , @xmath213 is a lattice in @xmath214 , with @xmath215 being one of its fundamental regions . with this lattice and fundamental region , the output at the destination is then @xmath216 , where @xmath21 is a one - dimensional gaussian random variable with variance @xmath197 . here",
    "@xmath217 denotes the largest integer that is smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "one can easily check that @xmath218 .",
    "the output at the wiretapper and source can be written in a similar manner .",
    "this @xmath212 example can be viewed as the continuous counterpart of the discrete channels considered in section  [ sec : full ] .",
    "let @xmath219 , and let @xmath220 be the probability density function of @xmath221 , one can easily verify that  @xcite @xmath222 denote the differential entropy of the noise term @xmath221 by @xmath223 . then @xmath224 we are now ready to prove the following .",
    "the secrecy capacity of mod-@xmath0 channel with noisy feedback is @xmath225    the proof follows along the same lines as that of theorem  [ thm : dmc ] . for the converse , was shown to be the capacity of the mod-@xmath0 channel with the absence of the wiretap in  @xcite , which naturally serves as an upper - bound for the secrecy capacity , as argued in the proof of theorem  [ thm : dmc ] .    to achieve this secrecy capacity",
    ", the source generates length-@xmath85 codewords @xmath12 , with the @xmath14th element @xmath226 being chosen uniformly from @xmath196 .",
    "hence each codeword @xmath227 .",
    "now , at time @xmath14 , the destination generates feedback signals @xmath228 with uniform distribution over the set @xmath196 , and thus the feedback signal @xmath229 is uniformly distributed over @xmath230 . based on the crypto lemma , for any codeword @xmath12 and any particular noise realization @xmath231 , the length-@xmath85 random variable received at the wiretapper @xmath232 is uniformly distributed over @xmath230 and is independent with @xmath111 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath112 on the other hand , with @xmath111 uniformly distributed over @xmath230 , the mutual information between @xmath233 and @xmath201 given @xmath229 ( the destination knows @xmath229 ) is @xmath234 so , for any @xmath55 , there exists a code with rate @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "this completes the achievablity part .",
    "our result for the modulo-@xmath0 channel sheds some light on the more challenging scenario of the wiretap awgn channel with feedback .",
    "the difference between the two cases results from the _ modulo _ restrictions imposed on the destination and wiretapper outputs .",
    "the first constraint does not entail any loss of generality due to the optimality of the modulo-@xmath0 approach in the awgn setting  @xcite .",
    "relaxing the second constraint , however , poses a challenge because it destroys the _ modulo _ structure necessary to hide the information from the wiretapper ( i.e. , the crypto lemma needs the group structure ) . in other words , if the wiretapper is not limited by the modulo - operation then it can gain some additional information about the source message from its observations .",
    "therefore , finding the secrecy capacity of the wiretap awgn channel remains elusive ( at the moment , we can only compute achievable rates using gaussian noise as the feedback signal ) .",
    "in this paper , we have obtained the secrecy capacity ( or achievable rate ) for several instantiations of the wiretap channel with noisy feedback . more specifically , with a full duplex destination , it has been shown that the secrecy capacity of modulo - additive channels is equal to the capacity of the source - destination channel in the absence of the wiretapper .",
    "furthermore , the secrecy capacity is achieved with a simple scheme in which the destination randomly chooses its feedback signal from a certain alphabet set .",
    "interestingly , with a slightly modified feedback scheme , we are able to achieve a positive secrecy rate for the half duplex channel . overall , our work has revealed a new encryption paradigm that exploits the structure of the wiretap channel and uses a private key known only to the destination .",
    "we have shown that this paradigm significantly outperforms the public discussion approach for sharing private keys between the source and destination .",
    "our results motivate several interesting directions for future research . for example , characterizing the secrecy capacity of arbitrary dmcs ( and the awgn channel ) with feedback remains an open problem . from an algorithmic perspective , it is also important to understand how to exploit different channel structures ( in addition to the modulo - additive one ) for encryption purposes . finally , extending our work to multi - user channel ( e.g. , the relay - eavesdropper channel  @xcite ) is of definite interest .",
