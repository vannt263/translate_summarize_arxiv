    "we interpreted the deficit observed in the gallium radioactive source experiments as a possible indication of the disappearance of electron neutrinos .",
    "we have analyzed the data in the effective framework of two - neutrino mixing , which describes neutrino oscillations due to a @xmath21 that is much larger than the solar and atmospheric ones .",
    "we found that there is an indication of electron neutrino disappearance due to neutrino oscillations with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we have also studied the compatibility of the data of the gallium radioactive source experiments with the data of the bugey and chooz reactor short - baseline antineutrino disappearance experiments in the same effective framework of two - neutrino mixing , in which the disappearance of neutrinos and antineutrinos are equal .",
    "we found that the bugey data present a hint of neutrino oscillations with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which is compatible with the region of the mixing parameters allowed by the analysis of the data of the gallium radioactive source experiments .",
    "we have also performed combined analyses of the bugey and chooz data , of the gallium and bugey data , of the gallium and chooz data , which show that the bugey and chooz data are compatible , the gallium and bugey data are compatible , and the gallium and chooz data are marginally compatible .",
    "the weak indication in favor of neutrino oscillations found in the analysis of the bugey data persists in the combined analyses of the bugey data with the gallium and chooz data .",
    "however , we can not exclude the absence of oscillations .    from a physical point of view , a hint in favor of short - baseline neutrino oscillations generated by @xmath1 is extremely interesting .",
    "this squared - mass difference is too large to be compatible with the three - neutrino mixing scheme inferred from the observation of neutrino oscillations in solar , very - long - baseline reactor , atmospheric and long - baseline accelerator experiments , in which there are only two independent squared - mass differences , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the results of our analysis indicate the possible existence of at least one light sterile neutrino @xmath24 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . we think that it is very important to explore this intriguing hint of new physics beyond the standard model .    as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , short - baseline @xmath25 transitions have an influence on the interpretation of all experiments with an initial @xmath26 beam . in the existing solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments",
    "the survival probability of @xmath26 is the averaged one in eq .",
    "( [ 019 ] ) .",
    "however , the uncertainties of the experimental data and our knowledge of the initial flux do not allow us to exclude @xmath25 transitions at the level of about 20% in the case of solar neutrinos @xcite and about 30% ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the case of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "future experiments which are well suited for finding small @xmath25 transitions are those with a source producing a @xmath26 flux which is known with high accuracy . since sterile neutrinos are invisible , @xmath25 transitions can be revealed either by measuring a disappearance of @xmath26 s without @xmath27 or @xmath28 production in the detection process or by measuring a disappearance of @xmath26 s due to oscillations with a squared - mass difference much larger than @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we are aware of the following possibilities : beta - beam experiments @xcite which have a pure @xmath31 or @xmath32 beam from nuclear decay ( see the reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; neutrino factory experiments in which the beam is composed of @xmath31 and @xmath33 , from @xmath34 decay , or @xmath32 and @xmath35 , from @xmath36 decay ( see the review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; mossbauer neutrino experiments , with a @xmath32 beam produced in recoiless nuclear decay and detected in recoiless nuclear antineutrino capture @xcite ; the lens detector @xcite with an artificial megacurie @xmath31 source @xcite .",
    "let us also notice the very interesting possibility to reveal the existence of sterile neutrinos in the flux of high - energy astrophysical neutrinos after their passage through the earth by measuring the peculiar matter effects @xcite .",
