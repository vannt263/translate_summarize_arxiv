    "to understand the processes that govern galaxy formation and evolution , detailed information must be collected about the behavior of the different galaxy populations under different conditions . a common and useful way to achieve this ,",
    "is the study of galaxy luminosities and their variation with the environment .",
    "the most suitable statistical tool to perform this kind of analysis is the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies .",
    "this function describes the distribution of luminosities of a given population of galaxies and , in most cases , it can be parametrized by a function with two parameters excluding the normalization ( @xcite ) , the characteristic absolute magnitude @xmath7 and the faint end slope @xmath8 .",
    "the results obtained from the analysis of these parameters are among the most interesting issues in extragalactic astronomy .    prior to 2000",
    "the lf has been computed for galaxies in the field , groups and in clusters of galaxies ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "two lines of thought have arisen from these works : one of them states that the lf depends on the environment while the other supports the idea of an universal lf .",
    "the dependence of the lf with the environment was proposed by some authors due to the very steep faint end slope found for the lf in clusters of galaxies which was interpreted as an excess of dwarf galaxies relative to the field . nevertheless , in order to have more reliable results on this matter , large samples of galaxies with high quality photometric and spectroscopic information were needed .    since the advent of the large surveys of galaxies , such as the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , @xcite ) , much better determinations of the lf",
    "have been obtained @xcite .",
    "most of these works agree with a flat lf of galaxies in the field ( @xmath9 ) meanwhile a brighter characteristic magnitude @xmath7 and a steeper faint end slope @xmath8 have been found in galaxy systems . analyzing a sample of rich clusters of galaxies obtained from a cross - correlation between the sloan digital sky survey and the rosat all sky survey ,",
    "@xcite have found that the very faint end slope ( @xmath10 ) is remarkably steep ( @xmath11 ) on these environments .",
    "similar results have been found by @xcite when lower density environments as galaxy groups are analyzed .",
    "it should be noted that both works have been carried out using statistical background subtraction methods owing to the lack of spectroscopic information for faint galaxies .",
    "these methods are sensitive to the background computation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table 2 ) and to the presence of structures along the line of sight @xcite , therefore , they are less reliable than those based only upon spectroscopic information .",
    "groups of galaxies are very interesting objects in the universe , since they are the most common systems of galaxies and the evolution of galaxies inside them plays an important role at early stages of cluster galaxies evolution .",
    "how important is the variation of galaxy luminosities with the main physical properties of these systems ?",
    "how does the environment affect the different galaxy populations ? .",
    "large statistical samples of galaxy groups are needed in order to these questions be addressed .",
    "the largest galaxy redshift survey at the present is the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( hereafter dr4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this catalog covers a very wide area on the sky , has high quality information in five broadbands and comprises two times the number of galaxies in the current final release of the 2dfgrs .",
    "the huge size of the sloan galaxy catalog will provide us of the largest galaxy group catalog at the present with very important photometric and spectroscopic information .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to compute the lfs of galaxies in groups under different conditions in order to understand the behavior of galaxies in intermediate density environments and consequently provide important clues on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the galaxy sample and the group identification",
    ". the full analysis of lfs as a function of the band , mass ranges , color and the brightest galaxy is in section 3 .",
    "finally in section 4 we summarize and discuss the results .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has validated and made publicly available its fourth data release ( dr4 ; @xcite ) which is a photometric and spectroscopic survey constructed with a dedicated @xmath12 telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico .",
    "the sdss dr4 consists of @xmath13 of five - band , @xmath14 , imaging data and 673,280 ( @xmath15 ) spectra of galaxies , quasars and stars .",
    "the dr4 main galaxy sample ( mgs ; @xcite ) includes roughly 400,000 galaxies with redshift measurements up to @xmath16 and an upper apparent magnitude limit of 17.77 in the @xmath17 band .",
    "galaxy groups used in this work have been identified in the mgs of dr4 using the same procedure as in @xcite .",
    "the method consists in using a friend - of - friend algorithm similar to that developed by @xcite .",
    "the algorithm links galaxies ( @xmath18 ) which satisfy that @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the projected distance and @xmath22 is the line - of - sight velocity difference .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath23 is introduced in order to take into account the decrement of the galaxy number density due to the apparent magnitude limit cutoff ( see eq . 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "we have adopted a transversal linking length @xmath24 corresponding to an overdensity of @xmath25 , a line - of - sight linking length of @xmath26 and a fiducial distance of @xmath27 . as in @xcite ,",
    "we have also carried out an improvement of the rich group identification .",
    "this improvement consists in performing a second identification on galaxy groups with at least ten members in order to split merged systems or to eliminate spurious member detections .",
    "this second identification uses a higher density contrast , @xmath28 , which produces a more reliable group identification ( see @xcite ) .",
    "group center locations for these groups have been improved using an iterative procedure developed by @xcite .",
    "the procedure defines a new group center estimation by using the projected local number density of each member galaxy for weighting their group center distances , and then iterates this estimation by removing galaxies beyond a given distance .",
    "the iteration follows until the center location remains unchanged .",
    "since the method needs to compute the projected local number density with five galaxies , this procedure can only be applied to group with at least ten members .",
    "finally , the group sample comprises 14004 groups with at least 4 members , adding up to 85728 galaxies .",
    "mean properties of groups in this sample are similar to those of the dr3 group catalog as quoted by @xcite .",
    "we obtain a median velocity dispersion , virial mass and radius of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the magnitudes we use in this work are the petrosian ones , and have been corrected for galactic extinction following @xcite .",
    "absolute magnitudes have been computed assuming @xmath32 , @xmath33 and a hubble constant @xmath34 , and @xmath35corrected using the method of @xcite .",
    "we have adopted a band shift to a redshift @xmath36 , i.e. to approximately the mean redshift of the main galaxy sample of sdss , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we have also included evolution corrections to this redshift for each galaxy of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 varies with the band : 4.22 , 2.04 , 1.62 , 1.61 and 0.76 for @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath17 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 bands respectively @xcite . throughout this work",
    "we will refer to these shifted bands as @xmath43 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "following the comparative study of different luminosity function estimators by @xcite , we have chosen two methods for computing luminosity functions : the non - parametric @xmath44 method @xcite and the sty method @xcite for fitting schechter function parameters . among the non - parametric methods ,",
    "the @xmath44 is the most robust estimator , being less affected by different values of the faint end slope of the schechter parametrization and sample size .",
    "meanwhile , the sty is reliable for fitting analytic expressions without binning the data .",
    "since we are only interested in studying the lf shape for different subsamples of galaxies in groups , all lfs in this paper are shown in arbitrary units .      for computing luminosity functions ,",
    "we have adopted the same apparent magnitude cut - offs as in @xcite . given that @xmath35corrections in each band are reliable only in a given redshift range , we have also introduced redshift cut - offs depending on the band ( table [ sty ] , see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath3 band lf for galaxies in groups is shown in figure [ lf ] , along with the best schechter function fit .",
    "the lf for the other bands and the corresponding fits are displayed in figure [ lfesplit ] .",
    "best fit schechter parameters can be found in table [ sty ] .",
    "it is noticeable from these figures that schechter functions provide a good description of the lf for all bands .    when comparing our results with those of @xcite ( their table 2 ) for the lfs of all galaxies in dr1 s mgs , we observe that , with the exception of the @xmath45 band , the characteristic magnitudes , @xmath46 are brighter for galaxies in groups .",
    "these observed brightening of @xmath7 ranges from @xmath47 in the @xmath5 band to @xmath48 magnitudes in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with more than @xmath49 significance in all cases . at the same time , group galaxies show a small steepening of the faint end slope , @xmath8 .",
    "the steepening is more pronounced for bluer bands , @xmath50 , where a change of @xmath51 in @xmath8 is observed . nevertheless , these differences are not very significant , since all of them lie within @xmath52 .",
    "these results are in agreement with those obtained by @xcite for galaxies in groups identified in the 100k release of the 2dfgrs , in the @xmath53 band .",
    "they found that the characteristic magnitude is brighter for galaxies in groups respect to the lf obtained for field galaxies by @xcite , while the faint end slope for galaxies in groups was statistically comparable with the field value .    in hierarchical models for galaxy formation and evolution , the frequency of mergers increase in intermediate mass systems such as groups .",
    "therefore , in this scenario , galaxies in groups and clusters are expected to be typically brighter than in the field , resulting in a brighter @xmath7 .",
    "this could explain the differences between group and field galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath45 band result , is not unexpected since this band is closely related to the current star formation , and galaxies in systems are likely to have lower or suppressed star formation rates ( see for instance @xcite ) .      in this subsection",
    "we study how the lf depends on group masses .",
    "a previous analysis on this matter was done by @xcite using the 2dfgrs percolation - inferred galaxy group catalog ( 2pigg ; @xcite ) .",
    "they split their group sample into three mass bins and compute the corresponding lfs using the standard @xmath54 and the sty methods . though their high mass bin is statistically poor and does not follow the same trend as the lower mass ones , they conclude that @xmath7 and @xmath8 decrease when mass increases .",
    "given the large number of groups we have identified in dr4 , we expect to obtain a more detailed description on this subject .",
    "we have split the full sample of @xmath55 groups into 6 mass bins defined to have roughly the same number of groups ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the details of this selection can be seen in table [ stymass ] .",
    "the large number of galaxies in the samples allows the determination of lfs with a high level of confidence , even when we are splitting the sample into several bins .    in figure [ lfmasa ]",
    "we show the resulting @xmath3 band lf for each mass bin .",
    "as it can be seen from figure [ lfmasa ] , the lfs are well fitted by schechter functions for all masses ( see parameters in table [ stymass ] ) . in order to simplify the reader interpretation of the results ,",
    "we show the values of @xmath7 _ vs. _ @xmath8 ( figure [ isomasa ] ) and @xmath7 and @xmath8 as a function of the mass ( figure [ amm ] ) .",
    "figure [ isomasa ] displays the @xmath57 and @xmath58 confidence ellipses according to sty computations .",
    "y - axis error - bars in figure [ amm ] are the projections of the 1@xmath59 joint error ellipse onto each axis of figure [ isomasa ] , while x - axis error - bars are the semi - interquartile range of the median mass .",
    "there are two clear and continuous trends : a brightening of @xmath7 and a simultaneous steepening of @xmath8 as mass increases .",
    "@xmath7 changes in @xmath60 magnitudes while @xmath8 varies in 0.4 , over two orders of magnitude in group mass .",
    "we have done the same calculations for the other sdss bands .",
    "the best - fitting schechter parameters are in table [ stymassband ] .",
    "we found the same global trends in all bands , with some differences for the @xmath45 band . in this case",
    "we observe a brightening of @xmath7 of @xmath61 magnitudes , significantly smaller than the @xmath62 magnitudes value for the other bands .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the @xmath45 band is sensitive to star formation , i.e. , @xmath45 luminosity function is a poor indicator of the underlying mass distribution .",
    "the faint end slope variation with mass is roughly the same , @xmath48 , for all bands .",
    "a similar result was found by @xcite analysing the variation of the of the lfs of galaxies in the 2dfgrs with the environment .",
    "they study the dependence of the lfs with the density contrast estimated within @xmath63 sphere observing a smooth variation of the schechter parameters in density environments ranging from voids to clusters .",
    "it should be taken into account that this parameter can not be directly related with group masses since the virial mass describes a closer environment than the corresponding to @xmath63 density contrast , even so , their results shows the same trends than the described in the previous paragraph .",
    "our results means that , as system mass increases , the characteristic luminosity of galaxies increases . regarding the steepening of the faint end slope with mass , at least two possibilities arise : an important fraction of bright , @xmath64 , galaxies gets brighter , then",
    "the ` knee ' of the schechter function becomes less pronounced and this gives a steeper @xmath8 , or , there are some physical mechanisms that increase the number of faint , @xmath65 , galaxies . therefore , there exist some processes that enhance galaxy brightness for bright galaxies and possibly some other processes that increase the number of faint galaxies .",
    "the effect of these processes becomes more noticeable for massive systems .",
    "merging and galactic cannibalism are likely to be responsible of producing brighter galaxies . as the result of a tidal interaction between two galaxies ,",
    "the massive counterpart can get brighter while the less massive diminishes its luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "processes involving the interaction between galaxies and the intra - system environment , such as ram pressure , are important for massive systems .",
    "it results in the loss of gas in less bound galaxies , drastically reducing the star formation .      in a previous work",
    ", @xcite found that the color distribution of galaxies can be approximated by a bimodal function , i.e. by the sum of two normal gaussian functions .",
    "this behavior can be explained by two different formation processes which generate two galaxy populations with different average colors .",
    "the most common choice is to adopt the @xmath6 color to split the galaxy distribution into two different populations .",
    "there are several works in the literature that use this color distribution to distinguish between two galaxy populations .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that it can not be chosen an unique color divider point since this point depends on absolute magnitude .",
    "so , in order to divide the sample of galaxies in groups into two different populations we have parametrized the relation between the color divider point and the absolute magnitude in the @xmath3 band .",
    "to do so , we firstly use the mgs and split it into absolute magnitude bins of width @xmath66 . for each absolute magnitude bin",
    ", we fit to the @xmath67corrected @xmath68 color distribution the sum of two gaussian functions .",
    "the color divider point is estimated as the intersection point between both gaussian functions .",
    "finally , we fit a straight line to the color divider points as a function of the @xmath3 absolute magnitude .",
    "the resulting linear relation is @xmath69 figure [ hiscol ] shows the @xmath54 weighted color - magnitude distribution for the mgs .",
    "the straight line shows the color divider point as a function of absolute magnitude according to equation [ cutoff ] . using this function we split the sample of galaxies in groups into two subsamples of red , @xmath70 , and blue , @xmath71 , galaxies .",
    "the @xmath3 band lfs for the red and blue sequences of galaxies in groups are shown in figure [ lfcolor ] together with the respective schechter best - fitting parameters ( see also table [ stymasscolor ] ) .",
    "when comparing our results with field values by @xcite , we observe that the red sequence in groups has a brighter characteristic magnitude and a slightly steeper faint end slope .",
    "taking into account error - bars and the band shift , the red sequence in the field and in groups have comparable lfs . on the other hand , there are some differences between the blue sequence in the field and in groups .",
    "we find a brighter @xmath7 and a steeper @xmath8 in groups .",
    "@xcite find @xmath72 for the blue sequence , which means a difference of @xmath73 magnitudes in @xmath7 . the blue sequence faint end slope is @xmath74 , therefore",
    ", galaxies in groups have a steeper @xmath8 in @xmath75 . nevertheless , owing to the errors in both determinations , the faint end slopes are statistically comparable ( @xmath76 difference ) .",
    "it should be noted that the similarity between the results obtained for field and group galaxies in the red sequence it is not unexpected since these galaxies are mainly located in galaxy systems . on the other hand",
    ", we do expect a difference for the lf of the blue sequence in groups compared with that obtained in the field , since a large fraction of blue galaxies are not in groups and , consequently , do not suffer the action of some typical physical processes of dense environments .",
    "we have also computed the @xmath3 band lf for blue and red sequences as a function of group mass , splitting groups into the same six mass bins used in the previous subsection .",
    "the resulting lfs are shown in figure [ lfmc ] while the corresponding best - fitting schechter parameters are quoted in table [ stymasscolor ] and shown in figure [ ammcolor ] .",
    "in the later , upper panel shows the behavior of @xmath7 as a function of mass , meanwhile the lower panel displays @xmath8 as a function of mass .",
    "we also show in both panels the variation of the schechter parameters with mass for all galaxies in groups , computed in the previous subsection . regarding the variation of @xmath7 with mass ,",
    "it is clear that the change is larger for the red sequence .",
    "@xmath7 smoothly decreases in @xmath77 magnitudes between the lowest and the highest mass subsamples . for the blue sequence",
    ", @xmath7 shows a small variation ( @xmath78 magnitudes ) for the first 5 mass bins , and doubles this brightening in the last one . the faint end slope as a function of mass also shows a larger variation for the red sequence , a steepening of 0.75 from low to high mass .",
    "excluding the highest mass bin ( @xmath79 ) , the blue sequence has a constant value of @xmath80 .    according to our results ,",
    "the red sequence luminosities show a strong variation with the system mass , while the blue sequence luminosities are roughly independent of mass . in the previous subsection we found that @xmath7 brightens and @xmath8 steepens when system mass increases ,",
    "hence we can now conclude that those changes are mainly observed in one of the populations , the red one .      when studying clusters of galaxies , one of the most interesting subjects is the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "they are preferentially elliptical , are located in the center of the potential well and are particularly massive and bright .",
    "even though their evolution and the effect of the environment upon them are not well understood , the most plausible scenario for their origin is that they form rapidly from mergers of several galaxies during the early stages of cluster or group collapse .",
    "later , they become brighter in more massive systems as hierarchical structure formation continues @xcite .    in this subsection",
    "we are interested in studying the lf of groups ( i.e. low and intermediate mass systems ) where there is an important luminosity difference between the brightest group galaxy ( bgg ) and the second ranked galaxy .",
    "to do so , we have split the sample of groups into two subsamples with roughly the same number of groups : those with a magnitude difference between the bgg and the second ranked galaxy , @xmath81 , and those with @xmath82 .",
    "it is worth to be mentioned that the absolute magnitude distribution of the bggs for both subsamples are quite similar .",
    "in order to avoid any possible bias with redshift we have restricted the group subsamples to @xmath83 .",
    "the resulting luminosity functions are shown in figure [ lfbgg ] and the corresponding best - fitting schechter parameters are in table [ stybgg ] . for the @xmath81 subsample @xmath7",
    "is @xmath84 magnitudes brighter , and @xmath8 is @xmath85 steeper with @xmath86 significance , than the @xmath87 subsample values .",
    "the two subsamples have similar group mass distributions .",
    "this was also found by @xcite in clusters , where the difference in luminosity between the bcg and the second ranked galaxy do not correlate with mass .",
    "hence , the results above , can not be associated with a possible mass bias .",
    "as said above , the most likely scenario for the bcgs formation is based upon the idea that these objects have been formed from mergers between several galaxies that take place in groups or low mass cluster . under this scheme ,",
    "the merging galaxies that form the bcgs are the bggs , i.e. the more luminous galaxies in groups .",
    "since the merger rate is a decreasing function of the velocity dispersion of a galaxy system , mergers should be the main responsible for the formation of the bggs , progenitors of the future bcg . from our results , we conclude that bggs that are considerably brighter than the remaining group members , are preferentially found in groups where mergers have been more effective , producing a brightening of the characteristic magnitude @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , it is known that the galactic cannibalism solely at the present epoch is unlikely to be the process responsible for the bgg origin since this scenario is not in agreement with a high value of @xmath88 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have observed that the large values of @xmath88 measured around the luminous red galaxies in the sdss support the idea that the bcgs form during the system collapse due to the process of merging small structures with a subsequent growth due to the accretion of lesser members .",
    "therefore , we can add to our picture that the bggs of our subsample with larger values of @xmath88 went through merging processes at the early stages of the galaxy systems formation .",
    "in this work we have studied the behavior of galaxy luminosities in groups of galaxies .",
    "we use the largest sample of galaxy groups at the present which allow us to obtain very reliable statistical results .",
    "the groups are identified in the sdss dr4 using the same procedure as the described by @xcite .",
    "the galaxy luminosities analysis is performed computing the lf for several subsamples of galaxies in groups .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * first , we compute the lfs of galaxies in groups in different sdss bands .",
    "our results show that , except for the @xmath45 band , the characteristic magnitude , @xmath7 , is @xmath48 magnitudes brighter than the obtained for field galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the faint end slope , @xmath8 , of these lfs are slightly steeper than their field counterparts . * then , we study the dependence of the @xmath3 lf of galaxies in groups for different bins in group mass . we observe two clear trends : a brightening of the characteristic magnitude ( @xmath89 ) and a steepening of the faint end slope ( @xmath90 ) as mass increases . *",
    "similar results are found when analyzing the mass dependence of the lfs in the remaining sdss bands for both , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "only the @xmath45 band shows a less pronounced brightening in the characteristic magnitude .",
    "since the @xmath45 band is more sensitive to current galaxy star formation , we expect that the lfs in this band to be less suitable to trace the mass , i.e. , to show the real brightening of @xmath7 as a function of group mass as observed in the other bands .",
    "* we made use of the bimodal @xmath68 distribution to split the galaxy sample into a red and a blue sequence .",
    "the divider point among the populations is estimated from a linear relation as a function of the @xmath3 absolute magnitude .",
    "the lf obtained for the red sequence is quite similar to that obtained by @xcite for field galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "even when the blue sequence in groups shows a similar faint end slope than the observed for the blue sequence in the field , its characteristic magnitude is significantly brighter than the field counterpart .",
    "* regarding the dependence of red and blue sequence lf in groups with the group mass we observe that the red sequence shows stronger changes in both , the characteristic magnitude and the faint end slope .",
    "the behavior of the blue sequence remains almost unchanged as system mass increases .",
    "* finally , studying the effect of the brightest group galaxy on these environments we split the galaxy sample into two subsamples : groups with ( @xmath81 ) and without ( @xmath91 ) a remarkable luminosity difference between the brightest group galaxy and the second ranked galaxy .",
    "we observe that those groups with larger @xmath88 have a brighter @xmath7 and a steeper @xmath8 than the other group subsample .    the most plausible scenario to explain the results above is one",
    "in which mergers have played a fundamental role in galaxy evolution in groups .",
    "it is well known from the literature that galaxy mergers are more frequent in low mass systems since the low galaxy velocity dispersion should induce higher encounter rates @xcite .",
    "they can account for the observed brightening of @xmath7 with mass and the reddening of galaxy colors given that these processes could consume gas in a burst of star formation and subsequently , at later times , induce lower star formation rates .",
    "our results fit into the scenario proposed by @xcite where mergers are the cause of the color bimodality , with a red population resulting from merger processes and a blue population that form stars at a rate determined by their internal physical properties .",
    "the fact that the lf of the blue population in groups remains almost unchanged with mass , supports the idea of a population that evolves independently of environment , while the observed behavior in the lf of the red galaxies reveals that these objects have been through major changes due to environmental effects .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the evolution of the lf of the red and blue sequences up to @xmath92 using also the bimodality distribution to perform the distinction among both populations .",
    "the main result is that the number density obtained for red sequence galaxies shows a strong evolution , while the blue sequence remains almost unchanged in the sampled redshift range .",
    "they conclude that the more plausible scenario to account for this effect is one in which some blue galaxies have suffer a strong suppression of their star formation due to gas - rich mergers , resulting in a migration to the red sequence and subsequently evolving there due to several stellar mergers .",
    "the @xcite model is quite consistent with the one suggested here to explain the behaviour of both populations .",
    "another result that should be explained is the decrease of the faint end slope with group mass .",
    "this parameter is the one that describes the shape of the schechter function and it is defined by both , the faint and the bright ends of the lf .",
    "therefore , any significant variation in any of these regions , should change the value of @xmath8 .",
    "a shallower distribution of bright galaxies can result in a steeper value of @xmath8 without changing the number of faint galaxies .",
    "hence , the merger scenery can also explain the resulting behavior of @xmath8 with mass .",
    "this does not exclude the possible incidence of environmental processes such as galaxy harassment , ram pressure , etc .",
    ", that could enhance the number of faint galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , it should be reminded that the limiting apparent magnitude of the mgs does not allow to probe the very faint end of the lf , therefore , the observed change in @xmath8 with mass , can not be unambiguously associated with a dwarf galaxy population .",
