    "possibility of kaon - nuclear bound states is of great interest in hadron and nuclear physics .",
    "a deeply bound kaonic nuclear state with a relatively small decay width was recently predicted and further studied in literatures.@xcite   possible high density matter caused by the strong kaon attractive force is also a subject of heated discussion.@xcite   in order to find such exotic states , several experimental searches have been carried out.@xcite   finuda collaboration has reported an observation of bound @xmath9 state at the binding energy , 115 mev.@xcite   interpretation of the peak found in this experiment is yet under discussion , while some advanced calculations , such as a 3-body calculation  la fadeev equation with @xmath10 channel coupling , have been performed.@xcite   other approaches include an interpretation as a nine - quark state studied in the mit bag model @xcite , and a kaon absorption process between two nucleons @xcite . while the coming j - parc facility will certainly answer to the question whether such deeply bound kaonic nuclear states exist , we need to study such a system in more extensive views .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a new interpretation to the `` kaon - nucleus '' states .",
    "we consider @xmath11-hypernuclear states .",
    "@xmath11 is the lowest negative parity baryon with mass around 1405 mev and strangeness @xmath12 .",
    "this baryon is in many senses unique .",
    "for instance , it is below any other non - strange baryons with negative parity and is isolated not forming an octet in @xmath13 .",
    "if it is assumed to be a @xmath14-wave baryon with spin 1/2 , then it requires a large spin - orbit splitting .",
    "its uniqueness has attracted a lot of attention and various exotic views of @xmath11 have been proposed .",
    "we here do not consider specific composition of @xmath11 , but simply assume that it belongs to a flavor singlet representation , and thus isolated .",
    "our claim is that the so - called kaon - nuclear bound states can be interpreted as a bound state of @xmath11 in a nucleus , or @xmath11-hypernucleus .",
    "then the finuda observation is regarded as a two - body bound state of @xmath11 and @xmath3 , whose binding energy is about 88 mev .",
    "larger systems , such as strange tribaryon can be a @xmath15 system and so on .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a model of @xmath16 interaction according to the one - boson exchange model and consider the two - body ( @xmath16 ) and three - body ( @xmath15 ) systems .",
    "as the @xmath17 interaction , we choose the same one - boson exchange model , the bonn potential @xcite and the nijmegen soft - core potential models @xcite .",
    "we extend these models to the @xmath16 systems and the @xmath4-exchange is also included in the same context between @xmath11 and @xmath3 .",
    "we then solve the two - body and three - body schrdinger equations using a variational method .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we construct the potential model for @xmath16 system .",
    "the features of the model in the context of possible quantum numbers of the @xmath11-nuclear states are also given . in section 3 ,",
    "the numerical results for the binding energies of two - body and three - body bound states are shown . in section 4 ,",
    "some discussion on the present results are given .",
    "the conclusion is given in section 5 .",
    "the phenomenological nuclear force is quite successful in studying nuclear systems . in order to setup the model for the @xmath0-hypernuclei",
    ", we discuss the phenomenological @xmath5 interaction .",
    "the nuclear forces among hyperons are not yet established , although a great amount of studies have been performed experimentally and theoretically so far . in general",
    ", it is considered that the interaction between baryons is described by exchange of mesons supplemented by phenomenological short - range repulsion . in the present study , based on the one - boson exchange picture , we extend the phenomenological nuclear forces between the @xmath17 pair to the @xmath5 pair interaction . in the bonn @xcite and nijmegen potentials",
    "@xcite , the scalar ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , pseudoscalar ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) and vector ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) bosons are exchanged between the @xmath17 pair .",
    "the explicit equations and the parameter sets for the bonn potential are shown in appendix . by considering the @xmath13 symmetry",
    ", we assume that these potentials are also applied to the @xmath5 pair . here",
    "the isovector mesons ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath23 ) are irrelevant to the @xmath5 interaction , since the @xmath0 is isosinglet .",
    "instead the @xmath4 ( and @xmath2 ) meson comes into the game in the exchange process @xmath24 .",
    "then , the @xmath5 potential is given by the sum @xmath25 the @xmath18-exchange potential , @xmath26 , is the most attractive force , and the @xmath22-exchange potential , @xmath27 , plays an essential role for the spin determination , as we see below . in the following ,",
    "we investigate several possibilities of the @xmath5 potential .    in the extended phenomenological nuclear forces in the @xmath5 pair , we have some unknown parameters ; the coupling constants @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 meson ) and the momentum cutoffs , which appear in the form factors . among them , the @xmath30 vertex constant , @xmath31 , is determined by the @xmath13 relation from the observed decay width of the @xmath32 channel .",
    "the @xmath33 coupling @xmath34 is obtained from the decay width @xmath35 mev . assuming that @xmath0 is a purely @xmath13 singlet state , the @xmath13 isoscalar factor",
    ", @xmath36 predicts the coupling constant @xmath37 . it should be noted that this coupling constant is much smaller than the @xmath38 coupling constant @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 meson plays only a minor role in the @xmath5 bound state as seen in the numerical calculation later .    here , the @xmath4-exchange has to be treated carefully .",
    "because @xmath11 lies close to the @xmath40 threshold , the kaon may have four momentum , @xmath41 , near the on - mass - shell values .",
    "then the kaon propagator can be enhanced strongly . in order to include this effect",
    ", we replace the kaon mass by an effective mass . assuming that the baryons are static",
    ", we obtain the finite energy transfer , @xmath42 , and the effective mass , @xmath43 this replacement indeed enhances the @xmath16 potential more strongly than the case of @xmath44 or @xmath45 potential .",
    "this is because that the @xmath46 coupling is a scalar coupling and the effect of @xmath47 comes only in the range of the potential .",
    "in contrast , a @xmath14-wave coupling gives rise to an extra @xmath48 factor , which significantly suppresses its effect on the @xmath44 or @xmath49 potential . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath4-exchange potential for @xmath5 pair is given by the coupling constant @xmath50 and the effective mass @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pspot ] ) in appendix .    yet",
    "the other parameters in the @xmath5 interaction are not fixed due to lack of experimental information . in the present study",
    ", we treat the @xmath52 as a free parameter , since the results happen to be most sensitive to the @xmath18-exchange .",
    "we further assume that the other parameters are the same as the @xmath17 interaction for simplicity .    here",
    "it is important for the later discussions to prospect the properties of the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "let us see the spin - dependence of the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "the spin - spin interaction is induced by the @xmath21 , @xmath4 and @xmath22 mesons .",
    "we consider the @xmath22-exchange force , since the @xmath22 meson coupling is much stronger than the @xmath21 and @xmath4 meson couplings .",
    "the static @xmath22-exchange potential is written in the momentum space as @xmath53 with a positive constant @xmath54 , and the @xmath22 meson mass @xmath55 . in the real space , the first term is a delta function type , while the second term is the standard yukawa potential . with a form factor introduced ,",
    "the delta type potential becomes a finite range potential . for the yukawa type potential ,",
    "the spin singlet is more attractive than the spin triplet .",
    "on the other hand , for the delta type potential , the spin triplet is more attractive than the spin singlet .",
    "usually the delta type potential at short distance plays a minor role due to strong repulsive core of the @xmath17 force , hence the yukawa potential is much more important .",
    "however , this is not the case for the @xmath5 potential .",
    "there , at short distances , the delta function is overwhelming to the yukawa type potential .",
    "consequently , in the @xmath5 potential , the spin triplet potential is more attractive at short distance than the spin singlet one .",
    "now we look at the possible quantum states of the @xmath0-hypernuclei , which are obtained in the spin and isospin combinations . it is assumed that all the particles occupy the lowest - energy @xmath56-orbit . since @xmath0 has spin @xmath57 and isospin @xmath58 ,",
    "the @xmath5 system has two states of spin and isospin ; @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath6 system takes the isosinglet and isotriplet states .",
    "the isosinglet state has the spin @xmath57 and @xmath61 states , where the @xmath17 pair is isosinglet and spin triplet .",
    "the isotriplet state has spin @xmath57 , where the @xmath17 pair is isotriplet and spin singlet .",
    "therefore the possible quantum numbers of the @xmath56-wave @xmath6 system are @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    here , we prospect the quantum numbers of the ground states of the @xmath0-hypernuclei by using the spin dependence of the @xmath22-exchange at short distance .",
    "it is expected that the ground state of the two body system ( @xmath5 ) is spin triplet . in order to understand the ground state of the three body system ( @xmath6 ) , the three possible states , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ,",
    "are expanded in terms of the @xmath5 pair ; @xmath65 for the isosinglet states , and @xmath66 for the isotriplet state . among these states ,",
    "the spin triplet interaction is contained most strongly in the @xmath63 state due to the largest value of coefficients of the @xmath67 component .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the @xmath63 is the ground state for the @xmath6 state . in the next section",
    ", it will be shown that the above analysis is consistent with the numerical results .",
    "the above conclusion of the spin of the two - body and three - body states is in strong contrast with the kaon bound state approach .",
    "there , the spin dependence is induced by the isospin dependence of @xmath68 interaction .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath69 system , the @xmath70 interaction is the driving force for the bound state .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath71 state contains more @xmath70 component than @xmath72 state .",
    "thus , the ground state of @xmath69 is expected to have @xmath73 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the numerical results for the two - body ( @xmath5 ) and three - body ( @xmath6 ) systems by solving the schrdinger equation with the bonn @xcite and nijmegen ( sc89 @xcite and esc04 @xcite ) potentials for the @xmath5 and @xmath17 interactions . for simplicity , derivative terms are not considered .",
    "we mainly show the results for the bonn potential .",
    "the results do not differ qualitatively for the nijmegen potentials with sc89 and esc04 .",
    "the two - body system ( @xmath5 ) has the spin singlet @xmath59 and triplet @xmath60 states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bonnyns0s1 - 39 ] , the bonn potentials are plotted as functions of the relative distance @xmath74 between @xmath0 and @xmath3 in the @xmath73 and @xmath75 channels for the coupling constant @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath75 potential is strongly attractive at short distance ( @xmath77 fm ) , while the @xmath73 one is repulsive .",
    "this difference is caused by the delta type interaction in the @xmath22 potential ( [ eq : spinspin ] ) , which is attractive for @xmath75 and repulsive for @xmath73 .",
    "it should be noted that the delta function is smeared to a finite range potential due to the form factor in the phenomenological nuclear forces .    in order to see the contributions from individual mesons in the @xmath75 @xmath5 potential ,",
    "the components from the @xmath18 , @xmath22 and @xmath21-exchange potentials and the additional @xmath4-exchange potentials are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bonnyns1 - 39 ] .",
    "the @xmath18-exchange potential is attractive at medium range ( @xmath78 fm ) , while the @xmath22 potential is repulsive .",
    "however , the @xmath22 potential is strongly attractive at shorter distances ( @xmath77 fm ) due to the delta function in ( [ eq : spinspin ] ) .",
    "hence , the sum of them employs a deeply attractive potential at short distance , which is one of the characteristic properties in the @xmath5 potential . the contributions from the @xmath21 and @xmath4 mesons are relatively weak .",
    "here we investigate the on - shell effect of the @xmath4-exchange .",
    "as we have already discussed , the @xmath4 meson propagating between the @xmath0 and @xmath3 may have large energy and thus can be close to the on - mass - shell kinematics . such @xmath4-exchange might be largely enhanced .",
    "we treat this effect as an effective mass @xmath80 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : onshell ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bonnkaon ] , the @xmath4-exchange potential is plotted for the bare mass @xmath81 mev ( solid line ) and for the reduced mass @xmath82 mev ( dashed line ) . as the effective @xmath4 meson mass gets smaller , both the potential strength and the range increase .",
    "however , this enhancement has little significance to the binding energy of the @xmath5 , since the @xmath4-exchange potential is still weaker than the @xmath18 and @xmath22-exchange potentials .      solving the schrdinger equation for the @xmath5 with the bonn potential , we obtain the binding energy and the wave function of the @xmath5 bound states . as a set of trial wave functions , we use a linear combination of gaussian functions ;",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 are the normalization constants , @xmath85 the width parameters , and @xmath74 the relative distance between @xmath0 and @xmath3 . as a result ,",
    "the binding energy strongly depends on the coupling constant @xmath86 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bonnenen ] .",
    "the @xmath18 potential plays an essential role for the formation of the bound state .",
    "indeed , without the @xmath87 coupling , the bound state does not exist . for @xmath75 , the @xmath5",
    "is bound for the coupling constant @xmath88 .    at @xmath89 ,",
    "the binding energy reaches 88 mev .",
    "the observed binding energy 115 mev of @xmath90 state reported by the finuda collaboration @xcite is interpreted as 88 mev for the binding energy of the @xmath0n state . for @xmath73 ,",
    "a stronger coupling @xmath91 is required for the bound state .",
    "the binding energy 88 mev is obtained at @xmath92 . in the current experimental status ,",
    "the quantum number of the bound state is not yet known .",
    "our result suggests an @xmath75 bound state rather than @xmath73 .",
    "the probability density of the @xmath5 with @xmath75 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wavyns1bonn ] .",
    "the wave function is very compact as compared with the nucleon size , suggesting that the obtained bound state is produced mainly by the short - range @xmath22 attraction assisted by the medium - range @xmath18-exchange that cancels the medium range @xmath22 repulsion .",
    "so far , we have discussed the results of the bonn potential . in order to check the model dependence",
    ", we also apply different types of the nuclear force . in particular , as the short - range part of the interaction is important , the mechanisms of short - range @xmath17 repulsion is in question .",
    "the bonn potential acquires the short - range repulsion mainly from the @xmath22-exchange potential , while the other models , such as the nijmegen potential , introduce a new component for the repulsion .",
    "the pomeron exchange is represented in the nijmegen potential by a gaussian potential of short range . in the case of @xmath17 interaction , it is strong enough to expel the wave functions away from the center .",
    "when we apply the same repulsion to @xmath5 system , we find that the short - range attraction from @xmath22-exchange may still make a bound state , if the @xmath18-exchange attraction at the medium range is strong enough . however , compared with the bonn potential , the extra pomeronic repulsion for @xmath5 makes the system less bound .",
    "that means that the required @xmath94 coupling constant becomes larger .",
    "we employ the nijmegen potential of the versions sc89 and esc04 . it is found that sc89 requires the minimal coupling constants @xmath95 and @xmath96 to form a @xmath5 bound state for @xmath75 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the binding energy ( 88 mev ) reported by the finuda group is obtained by setting @xmath97 for @xmath75 and @xmath98 for @xmath73 .",
    "the probability density is pushed out from the center as compared with the bonn potential .",
    "this is because the range of the @xmath5 potential is longer than that from the bonn potential .",
    "the result of esc04 is qualitatively the same as that of sc89 .",
    "only difference is that absolute values of the @xmath18 , @xmath22 and pomeron exchange potentials in esc04 are smaller than those in sc89 .",
    "then , the minimum coupling constants of @xmath87 become larger , and the experimental binding energy is reproduced at @xmath99 for @xmath75 and @xmath100 for @xmath73 .    the results above discussed are summarized in table [ tbl : table1 ] .",
    "the ratios of coupling constants @xmath86 that correspond to the experimental observation in the finuda collaboration are listed .",
    "the smaller value indicates that the system can form a bound state more easily .",
    "we find that in all cases that the coupling constant in @xmath75 bound state is smaller than that in @xmath73 one in the bonn and nijmegen potentials .",
    "therefore , we expect that the lowest - energy bound state is the @xmath75 state .        99 y. akaishi and t. yamazaki , phys .  rev .",
