    "the singularity theorems revealed that the occurrence of singularities is a generic property of space - time in general relativity@xcite .",
    "however , those theorems say nothing about the detailed features of the singularities themselves ; for example , we do not get information from those theorems about whether the predicted singularity is naked or not .",
    "naked means that the singularity is observable .",
    "a singularity is a boundary of space - time .",
    "hence , in order to obtain a solution of hyperbolic field equations for matter , gauge fields and space - time itself in the causal future of a naked singularity , we need to impose a boundary condition on it . however , we do not yet know physically reasonable boundary conditions on singularities and hence to avoid this difficulty , the cosmic censorship hypotheses ( cch ) proposed by penrose @xcite are often adopted in the analysis of the physical phenomena of the strong gravitational fields",
    ".    there are weak and strong versions of the cch . the weak cch states that a singularity is covered by an event horizon and never observed by anyone included in the causal past of future null infinity ( not globally naked ) while the strong",
    "cch says that nobody can observe a singularity ( not locally naked ) .",
    "however , the validity of the cch is one of the most important open questions in classical general relativity .",
    "no one has ever proved that these hypotheses hold . on the contrary",
    ", some researchers found , analytically or numerically , that there are solutions of the einstein equations which have naked singularities . if these naked singularities are physically realizable , then we could be in an embarrassing situation because an important assumption in theorems on the nature of a black hole is violated . in the vicinity of a singularity",
    ", quantum effects on the space - time will play an important role and therefore if the existence of naked singularities is generic , in order to understand the nature of a black hole , we might need the knowledge of the quantum theory of gravity even if the black hole is a classical entity .    in the last two decades",
    "several researchers have shown that the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) space - time@xcite is one of the candidates for a counter example to both versions of the cch .",
    "this space - time describes the motion of a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous dust cloud and is completely specified by initial values of the rest mass density and specific energy of the dust fluid .",
    "eardley and smarr showed that the central singularity of the ltb space - time can be shell - focusing and naked in the case of marginally bound collapse@xcite .",

    "these results are summarized as follows ; in this space - time , a naked singularity appears from generic initial data for _ spherically symmetric _ configurations of the rest mass density and specific energy of the dust fluid .    in order to recognize this example as a serious counter example to the cch , we should examine its genericity .",
    "that is to say , there is a possibility that the naked singularity is due to physically unrealistic conditions , e.g. , assumptions of the spherical symmetry , dust matter and so on .",
    "shapiro and teukolsky studied evolution of collisionless gas spheroids by fully general relativistic simulations@xcite .",
    "they found that prolate spheroids with sufficiently elongated initial configurations and even with some angular momentum , may form naked singularities .",
    "ori and piran numerically examined the structure of self - similar spherical collapse solutions for a perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state@xcite .",
    "they showed that there is a globally naked singularity in a significant part of the space of self - similar solutions .",
    "joshi and dwivedi analytically investigated the self - similar spherically symmetric collapse of a perfect fluid with a similar equation of state@xcite and further the naked singularity produced by the gravitational collapse of radiation shells@xcite and of more general matter@xcite .    in this article , we concentrate our attention on the issue whether the spherical symmetry is essential to the occurrence of the shell focusing naked singularity . for this purpose , we consider odd - parity modes of non - spherically symmetric perturbations in the marginally bound ltb space - time and examine the stability of the ` nakedness ' of that naked singularity against those linear perturbations . as for the non - spherically symmetric collapse case",
    ", joshi and krolack revealed that a naked singularity appears also in the szekeres space - time with an irrotational dust matter@xcite .",
    "since the odd - parity perturbations correspond to the rotational motions of the dust fluid and of the space - time itself , our analysis will give a new insight into the formations of naked singularities in non - spherically symmetric space - time .    to decouple physical effects from gauge or coordinate ones",
    ", we adopt the gauge - invariant formalism formulated by gerlach and sengupta@xcite for general spherically symmetric space - times . here",
    "we consider only the metric perturbations , i.e. , linear gravitational waves . using this formalism , we obtain a single decoupled partial differential equation for a gauge - invariant variable corresponding to the odd - parity metric perturbations of the ltb space - time .",
    "we analyze this equation numerically by use of single null coordinates , which was adopted by goldwirth and piran@xcite for the numerical study of spherical collapse of a massless scalar field",
    ". then we shall discuss the stability of the ltb space - time with a central naked singularity from the results of these analyses .",
    "a naked singularity is interpreted to be unstable , if perturbations tend to diverge as they approach the naked singularity and the cauchy horizon associated with it .",
    "if such a behavior is found , it means that the perturbations will destroy the cauchy horizon and change the causal structure of this space - time .",
    "waugh and lake examined the stability of the central naked singularity of the ltb space - time against perturbations of a massless field by the use of the high - frequency ( eikonal ) approximation and with the assumption of no back reaction of the massless field to the space - time geometry@xcite .",
    "their analysis revealed that the formation of the central naked singularity is stable within the validity of their approximation .",
    "in contrast to the analysis by waugh and lake , however , the effect of the finite wavelength of the perturbations and the non spherically symmetric dynamics of the space - time itself are taken into account up to the linear order in our present analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : ltb space - time ] , we briefly describe the ltb space - time . in section [ sec : perturbation ] , we derive the basic equations for perturbations in the ltb space - time and then give regularity conditions for the perturbations at the symmetric center , which are significant for our stability analysis of the central naked singularity formation . in section [ sec : riemann tensor ] , we present the expressions for the perturbations of the riemann tensor .",
    "we show the numerical procedure and results for the marginally bound ltb space - time in section [ sec : numerical results ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the summary and discussions .",
    "we adopt the geometrized units , @xmath0 . the signature of the metric tensor and sign convention of the riemann tensor follow ref.@xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneous spherically symmetric dust collapse is described by the ltb space - time . using the synchronous coordinate system , the line element of this space - time",
    "is expressed in the form @xmath1 the energy - momentum tensor for the dust fluid is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rest mass density and @xmath4 is the 4-velocity of the dust fluid . in the synchronous coordinate system ,",
    "the unit normal vector field to the spacelike hypersurfaces is geodesic and there is a freedom of which timelike geodesic field is adopted as the hypersurface unit normal . using this freedom , we can always set @xmath5 since the 4-velocity of the spherically symmetric dust fluid is tangent to an irrotational timelike geodesic field .",
    "then the einstein equations and the equation of motion for the dust fluid reduce to the following simple equations , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath9 . from eq.([eq : einstein ] ) , @xmath8 is related to the misner - sharp mass function@xcite , @xmath10 , of the dust cloud in the manner @xmath11 hence eq.([eq : energyeq ] ) might be regarded as the energy equation per unit mass .",
    "this means that the other arbitrary function , @xmath7 , is recognized as the specific energy of the dust fluid .",
    "the motion of the dust cloud is completely specified by the function , @xmath8 , ( or equivalently , the initial distribution of the rest mass density , @xmath12 ) and the specific energy , @xmath7 . when we restrict our calculation to the case that the symmetric center , @xmath13 , is initially regular",
    ", the central shell focusing singularity is naked if and only if @xmath14 is initially satisfied for the marginally bound collapse , @xmath15 @xcite . for the collapse",
    "that is not marginally bound , there exists a similar condition as an inequality for a value depending on the functional forms of @xmath8 and @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the perturbation method used in this article is the gauge - invariant one which has been formulated by gerlach and sengupta@xcite for a general spherically symmetric background space - time .",
    "first we briefly review their formalism only for the so - called odd - parity modes .",
    "thereafter we will apply this formalism to the ltb space - time in order to derive the basic equations for our analysis .",
    "the perturbed metric tensor is expressed in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the metric tensor of the spherically symmetric background space - time and @xmath18 is a perturbation . the energy - momentum tensor is written in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a background quantity and @xmath21 is a perturbation . by virtue of the spherical symmetry of the background space - time , @xmath22 is expressed in the form @xmath23 where the sub- and superscripts , @xmath24 represent @xmath25 and @xmath9 while @xmath26 represent @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    ", we get @xmath40    now we apply the above formalism to the case of the background ltb space - time . from eqs.([bgmatter ] ) and ( [ gs - pmatter ] ) , we find that there is no density perturbation and that only the perturbation of 4-velocity , @xmath41 , exists ; @xmath42 therefore the odd - parity gauge - invariant matter variables become @xmath43 from eqs.([gs-9a ] ) and ( [ gs-9b ] ) , we obtain the equations of motion for the metric variables , @xmath44 where we have introduced another gauge - invariant variable , @xmath45 , defined as @xmath46.\\ ] ]    eq.([gs-14 ] ) becomes @xmath47 this equation is easily integrated and we obtain @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an arbitrary function depending only on @xmath9 . from eqs.([wave2 ] ) , ( [ wave3 ] ) , and ( [ kakuundouryou ] ) , we obtain a single decoupled wave equation in the form @xmath50    the variable , @xmath51 , differs from the gauge - invariant variable used in ref.@xcite by a factor of @xmath52 .",
    "the reason why we adopt @xmath45 as a gauge - invariant variable instead is due to regularity conditions at @xmath13 .",
    "further , as will be shown later , @xmath45 is closely connected with the curvature tensor near the center .",
    "let us consider the regularity conditions for the background metric functions and gauge - invariant perturbations at @xmath13 .",
    "hereafter we restrict ourselves to the axisymmetric case , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "note that this restriction does not lose generality of our analysis .",
    "further we consider only the case in which the space - time is regular before the occurrence of the singularity .",
    "this means that , before the naked singularity formation , the metric functions , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , behave near the center in the manner @xmath56 to investigate the regularity conditions of the gauge - invariant variables , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we follow bardeen and piran@xcite .",

    "the dotted line denotes the result for case 3 .",
    "the left - hand peaks in fig.[fig:100m](a ) correspond to the initial incident waves . on the other hand , the right - hand peaks of cases 1 and 2 in this figure correspond to the scattered outgoing waves . in case 3 ,",
    "the right - hand peak does not exist and this is because , in this case , almost all portions of the incident waves enter into the cauchy horizon associated with the central naked singularity and hence it is impossible to follow numerically the scattered waves in the causal future of the central naked singularity .",
    "fig.[fig:100m](b ) shows detailed behavior of the scattered @xmath45 for case 2 .",
    "it is a most important fact seen in these figures that the amplitude of the scattered waves is almost the same as that of the initial incident waves in cases 1 and 2 .    in order to investigate the effect of the wavelength of @xmath51",
    ", we perform the numerical integration for case 2 but with different initial widths of wave packets .",
    "the results of narrower ( @xmath132 ) and broader ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) widths than the case plotted in fig.[fig:100m](a ) and ( b ) are shown in fig.[fig:100m](c ) .",
    "the narrower wave is similar to @xmath135 while the broader packets have different forms of scattered waves from the narrower one .",
    "however , in both cases , the amplitude of the scattered wave is not so different from the incident one .",
    "here we investigate the behavior of @xmath51 in the minkowski space - time and compare it with the results of the ltb space - time obtained in the above in order to reveal the effects of the existence of the dust cloud and the central naked singularity on the dynamics of @xmath51 . in the minkowski case , since @xmath136 , eq.([wave - eq ] ) becomes @xmath137 the solution of this equation which is regular at @xmath13 is obtained in the form @xmath138 where @xmath139 is an arbitrary function and @xmath140 denotes the @xmath141-th order derivative of @xmath139 with respect to @xmath142 .",
    "we set the following initial wave packet on the null hypersurface , @xmath143 , @xmath144.\\ ] ] using the above solution , we compare the evolution of wave forms in the minkowski space - time with that in the ltb space - time .",
    "the initial wave packet in the ltb space - time has been given by eq.([initial ] ) as a function of the coordinate radius , @xmath121 .",
    "however , note that @xmath121 does not agree with the circumferential radius , @xmath145 , in this case but in the minkowski case , the coordinate radius , @xmath9 , agrees with the circumferential radius , @xmath145 . since the circumferential radius , @xmath145 ,",
    "is tightly connected with the behavior of the amplitude of the wave , we should set the same initial data with respect to @xmath145 both for the ltb and minkowski cases . hence first we plot the initial wave packet ( [ initial ] ) as a function of @xmath146 on the initial null hypersurface and then the values of @xmath124 and @xmath147 in eq.([min - ini ] )",
    "are adjusted so that the initial wave form fits well with that of the ltb case .",
    "first we consider the evolution of @xmath51 at the center .",
    "using eqs.([gen - sol ] ) and ( [ min - ini ] ) , we obtain @xmath45 at the center in the form @xmath148\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2 }    \\left(\\frac{t}{2}-r_c\\right)^2    \\right ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameters , @xmath124 and @xmath149 , in eq.([min - ini ] ) are chosen so that the initial wave packets fit well with those of the cases 1 and 2 of fig[fig : center1 ] .",
    "the results are given in fig.[fig : compare1](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , and in this figure , we also plot the results for the corresponding cases of the ltb space - time .",
    "it should be noted that there is scarcely any difference between the wave forms of the minkowski and ltb cases .",
    "next we consider the behavior of @xmath51 at a finite circumferential radius which agrees with the numerical value of @xmath131 in the ltb case . here",
    "the wave form is obtained numerically by the same procedure as in the ltb case .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : compare2 ] .",
    "we also plot the corresponding case of the ltb space - time in the same figure .",
    "we find that there is a little difference of the phase between the minkowski and ltb cases .",
    "however , the behavior of @xmath51 in the minkowski case is basically the same as that in the ltb case .",
    "the effect due to the dust cloud and the existence of the central naked singularity on the propagation of @xmath51 is rather small .",
    "we consider the relation between the maximum value of @xmath150 observed at the center and the width , @xmath124 , of an initial wave packet in the minkowski space - time .",
    "this relation is obtained from eq.([min - r=0 ] ) .",
    "the results are also shown in fig.[fig : sigma2 ] .",
    "the power - law relation eq.([power ] ) is also valid in the minkowski case . from eq.([gen - sol ] ) , @xmath45 is approximately proportion to @xmath151 except for the region of @xmath152 around the center .",
    "if the initial amplitude of the wave packet has a value @xmath153 at @xmath154 , then the value of @xmath45 at @xmath155 is roughly estimated as @xmath156 .",
    "this will be the reason why the relation ( [ power ] ) holds in the minkowski space - time . as we have discussed above",
    ", @xmath45 behaves outside the cauchy horizon of the ltb space - time in approximately the same manner as in the minkowski space - time",
    ". therefore it would be also the reason why the relation ( [ power ] ) holds in the ltb space - time .    as a result",
    ", we conclude that even in the neighborhood of the central naked singularity and of the cauchy horizon associated with it , the metric perturbation , @xmath51 , does not show any peculiar behavior .",
    "however , we should note that @xmath51 does not vanish in the neighborhood of the central naked singularity although it is well - behaved .",
    "therefore , the formation process of the central naked singularity is _ marginally stable _ against the odd - parity metric perturbations .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of the odd - parity linear perturbations in the ltb space - time .",
    "we have derived the wave equation for the gauge - invariant variable , @xmath45 . from the analysis of the regularity for @xmath45 and the perturbations of the riemann tensor , only the quadrupole mode ,",
    "@xmath66 , of @xmath45 and of the magnetic part of the weyl tensor does not vanish at the symmetric center of the background ltb space - time , where a naked singularity appears in the course of the gravitational collapse of the dust cloud .",
    "therefore this quadrupole mode is the most important for the stability analysis of naked singularity formation in the ltb space - time .",
    "then we have performed numerical experiments on how a gaussian - shaped incident wave packet behaves under this wave equation for the @xmath66 mode without matter perturbations . from those numerical experiments ,",
    "we have obtained the following results .",
    "when this wave packet approaches the center , its amplitude becomes larger but finite .",
    "the amplitude at the center depends on the width of the initial wave packet according to a power law . on the other hand , when the incident wave packet initially located outside the dust cloud returns back to the same circumferential radius as the initial one , the amplitude of the returned wave is almost equal to that of the incident one .    in order to reveal the characteristic effects of the ltb space - time on the behavior of @xmath51 ,",
    "we have also investigated @xmath51 in the minkowski space - time .",
    "then we have found that in the outside of the cauchy horizon associated with the central naked singularity , the behavior of @xmath51 in the ltb space - time seems to be not so different from that in the minkowski space - time at least except for the extreme neighborhood of the naked singularity .",
    "therefore the power - law dependence in the ltb space - time described above is basically realized by the analytical discussion about the case of the minkowski space - time .",
    "further the propagation effect due to the existence of the dust cloud and the occurrence of the central naked singularity is rather small . in other words , there is no peculiar behavior of @xmath51 even in the neighborhood of the central naked singularity .",
    "however , it should be noted that the odd - parity metric perturbation does not vanish in the neighborhood of the central naked singularity and cauchy horizon associated with it . as a result",
    ", we conclude that the central naked singularity formation in the ltb space - time is ` marginally ' stable against the odd - parity metric perturbations .",
    "we note that our analyses are not sufficient to determine the stability of the naked singularity formation in the ltb space - time .",
    "there remain some problems to complete the analysis .",
    "the first problem is to take account of odd - parity matter perturbations .",
    "we are now investigating this problem .",
    "the second is to consider the even - parity mode in which the metric and matter perturbations are essentially coupled with each other .",
    "this problem will be analyzed in future . in this paper , we have dealt with the marginally bound case . for the case that is not marginally bound collapse",
    ", the condition of the appearance of the central naked singularity is slightly different from the above case@xcite and hence there is a possibility that the behavior of @xmath51 in this case is different from the marginally bound one .",
    "this case is now under investigation .",
    "we would like to thank t. nakamura , m. sasaki , m. shibata , t. tanaka , m. siino and t. chiba for helpful and useful discussions , and n. sugiyama and s. a. hayward for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we are also grateful to h. sato and colleagues in the theoretical astrophysics group in kyoto university for useful comments and encouragement .",
    "we present an analytic solution of the wave equations for the @xmath82 mode . substituting @xmath82 into eqs.([wave2 ] ) and ( [ wave3 ] ) , we get @xmath157 & = & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.([l=1-sita ] ) is easily integrated and we obtain @xmath158 where @xmath159 is an arbitrary function of @xmath25 . substituting this equation into ( [ l=1-g - s-9 ] ) , we obtain @xmath160 hence the function , @xmath159 , is temporally constant . from eq.([kakuundouryou ] ) and the regularity conditions for @xmath145 , @xmath58 and @xmath45 , the left hand side of eq.([sita ] ) vanishes at the center . therefore the function , @xmath159 ,",
    "should vanish identically and the solution for the dipole mode is obtained in the form @xmath161 from the regularity condition , ( [ r-0-psis1 ] ) , @xmath162 , is identically zero at the regular center and hence this mode does not affect the formation of the central naked singularity .",
