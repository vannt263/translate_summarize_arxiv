    "the discovery ( cottam , paerels , & mndez 2002 ) of line features in the average spectrum of 28 type - i x - ray bursts from the neutron star in the low - mass - x - ray - binary ( lmxb ) is a significant advance that provides new information on the structure of neutron stars and the properties of dense matter .",
    "the lines were detected using xmm - newton and have been identified as resonance scattering lines of fe  xxv h@xmath1 , fe  xxv 23 , and possibly o  viii ly@xmath1 .",
    "the gravitational redshifts inferred from the observed energies of all three lines are @xmath20.35 ( cottam et al .",
    "2002 ) , consistent with their formation at the surface of the star .",
    "the profiles of atomic lines formed at the surface of a neutron star are affected not only by the gravitational redshift there , but also by the star s radius , spin , angular momentum , and magnetic field .",
    "such lines carry more information about the properties of the star , the equation of state ( eos ) of cold , high - density matter , and the binary system than any other features of the star s spectrum .",
    "the x - ray burst oscillations of show that the spin frequency of the neutron star in this system is 45  hz ( villarreal & strohmayer 2004 ) , implying a line - of - sight rotational speed at the stellar surface @xmath3  c and a rotational doppler width at most ten times the fe line width produced by stark broadening ( see bildsten , chang , & paerels 2003 ) , even for the high system inclination @xmath4@xmath5 indicated by the dips and eclipses observed in this system ( parmar et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "spin rates as low as 45  hz are expected only if the accretion phase has lasted less than the time required to spin up the star , or the accretion rate is low enough or the star s magnetic field strong enough that the star has reached spin equilibrium ( lamb & yu 2004 ) .",
    "magnetic splitting by fields @xmath6  g would change the profiles of the fe lines significantly , and fields an order of magnitude stronger would shift the energy @xmath7 of the line center ( loeb 2003 ) .",
    "consequently , the strength of the magnetic field in and in other burst sources is an important issue .",
    "some 16 neutron stars in lmxbs have spin rates ranging from 200  hz to 600  hz ( see lamb & yu 2004 ) , much higher than the spin rate of the neutron star in .",
    "spin rates this high imply surface speeds near the rotational equator of 0.050.20  c. atomic lines formed at the surfaces of such rapidly spinning stars may be broadened substantially by rotational doppler broadening ( zel & psaltis 2003 ) .",
    "the magnitude of this broadening is an important issue in determining whether general relativistic effects can be detected .",
    "here we summarize the most important results of a detailed theoretical study of the effects of general relativity on the shapes of atomic spectral lines formed at the surfaces of spinning neutron stars .",
    "some of these effects were illustrated by zel & psaltis ( 2003 ) .",
    "we also discuss the evidence concerning the strengths of the magnetic fields of neutron stars in lmxbs and the implications for magnetic splitting of lines formed near their surfaces and for measurement of general relativistic effects .",
    "we find that even lines formed at the surfaces of stars with spin rates as large as hundreds of hertz observed at inclinations to the spin axis as high as @xmath8 can have relative widths @xmath9 as small as @xmath10 , if they are formed predominantly within @xmath210@xmath1120@xmath11 of the spin axis .",
    "we show that using the geometric mean of the energies of the line wings greatly reduces the systematic error in determinations of the star s mass - to - radius ratio .",
    "we also show that the ratios of the depths of the red and blue flux minima of a resonance scattering line provide a unique signature of frame - dragging . in most neutron stars in low - mass systems , magnetic splitting of lines",
    "is too small to obscure the effects of special and general relativity on their profiles .",
    "finally , we discuss the prospects for detecting these relativistic effects . in the rest of this paper we use geometric units in which @xmath12 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "at a given instant , the x - ray emitting portion of the neutron star surface could be a hot spot ( produced , e.g. , by magnetically channeled accretion , confined thermonuclear burning , or localized cooling gas ) , a belt ( produced , e.g. , by disk accretion near the rotational equator or rotationally confined thermonuclear burning ) , or a combination .",
    "emission from a localized region that is not at the rotation pole is effectively smeared into an axisymmetric belt when averaged over many spin periods .",
    "this is to be expected for the spin frequencies @xmath13  hz of neutron stars in lmxbs and the integration times of seconds typical of current high - resolution spectroscopic measurements .",
    "we therefore treat the emission as coming from an axisymmetric belt and assume for simplicity that the belt is uniformly bright .",
    "the profile of a spectral line formed at the stellar surface carries the imprint of several physical effects .",
    "here we consider ( 1 )  magnetic ( zeeman or paschen - back ) splitting by the star s magnetic field , ( 2 )  longitudinal and transverse doppler shifts , ( 3 )  special relativistic beaming , ( 4 )  gravitational redshifts , ( 5 )  light - bending , and ( 6 )  frame - dragging .",
    "we treat the star as spherical , neglecting the effects of the spin - induced stellar oblateness and the deviation of the exterior spacetime from kerr , which are small compared to the uncertainties .",
    "and a spin rate of 400  hz as measured at infinity , constructed using the a18@xmath14uix eos ( akmal , pandharipande , & ravenhall 1998 ) , the ratio of the polar radius to the equatorial radius is greater than 0.965 ; all other effects of the star s oblateness are at most a few percent .",
    "the kerr spacetime is an accurate approximation to the exterior spacetime of a spinning neutron star only to first order in the spin ; higher accuracy requires numerical computation of the spacetime ( see miller , lamb , & cook 1998 ) . ]    effects  ( 1)(6 ) influence the line shape in different ways .",
    "magnetic splitting , doppler shifts and the variation in the emitting area for a given observed energy cause an otherwise narrow scattering line to become broader and can cause it to have two minima .",
    "the gravitational redshift and transverse doppler effect both shift the line toward lower energies . special relativistic beaming deepens the blue minimum but suppresses ( or eliminates ) the red minimum , for emission from a belt around the star .",
    "light - bending deepens both minima , but deepens the red minimum more and can sometimes make visible a red minimum that was suppressed by special relativistic beaming .",
    "finally , frame - dragging broadens the line and shifts it slightly toward higher energies",
    ".    to compute detailed line shapes , we first assumed ( 1 )  an eos , ( 2 )  a gravitational mass @xmath15 , and ( 3 )  a stellar spin rate @xmath16 .",
    "we chose as a representative modernv+uix , fit the nijmegen database ( stoks et al .",
    "1993 ) with @xmath17 are called ` modern ' . ]",
    "eos the a18@xmath14uix model of akmal et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which combines the argonne @xmath18 ( a18 ) model of the two - nucleon - interaction ( wiringa , stoks , & schiavilla 1995 ) , the urbana ix ( uix ) model of the three - nucleon interaction ( pudliner et al .  1995 ) , and relativistic boost corrections to the a18 interaction . using this eos , we determined the star s radius @xmath19 and dimensionless angular momentum @xmath20 by computing numerically and self - consistently the structure and interior spacetime of the star , following cook , shapiro , & teukolsky ( 1994",
    "; see bhattacharyya et al .  2000 for a detailed description of the method we used ) .",
    "we usually consider an emitting belt in the northern hemisphere specified by ( 4 )  the colatitude @xmath21 of its northernmost ( polar ) edge and ( 5 )  the colatitude @xmath22 of its southernmost ( equatorial ) edge . alternatively",
    ", we specify the location and width of the belt by the colatitude @xmath23 of its center and its angular half - width @xmath24 .",
    "the emission from each point in the belt is specified in the corotating frame by ( 6 )  an intensity distribution of the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the angle measured from the local normal to the stellar surface and the parameter @xmath27 specifies the degree of beaming .",
    "except when we consider magnetic splitting , we assumed a boxcar intrinsic line shape with ( 7 )  a halfwidth @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the rest energy of the line center ; this is comparable to the width expected from stark broadening ( bildsten et al .  2003 ) .",
    "the final parameter is ( 8)  the inclination @xmath30 of the observer relative to stellar spin axis .",
    "given these eight parameters , we determine the image of the source seen by the observer by tracing the path of photons in the kerr space - time from the observer back to the source .",
    "we then compute the observed spectrum by integrating the energy - dependent specific intensity over the image ( for a more detailed description of this procedure , see bhattacharyya , bhattacharya , & thampan 2001 ) .",
    "our method reproduces ( for @xmath31 the results of zel & psaltis for their parameter choices .",
    "the calculations reported here ignore instrumental broadening , to show what may be possible in the future .",
    "the combined effects of magnetic splitting , doppler shifts , special relativistic beaming , gravitational redshift , light - bending , and frame - dragging typically make lines broader , shallower , and skewed , and can create two flux minima ( see fig .  1 , where the profiles are scaled to have the same equivalent width ) .",
    "these effects do not weaken lines , contrary to what has sometimes been implied in the literature ( see , e.g. , zel & psaltis 2003 ) : their equivalent widths remain unchanged .",
    "note , however , that a broader and shallower line might be more difficult to detect .    whether magnetic splitting is",
    "an important broadening mechanism depends on the strength of the star s surface magnetic field .",
    "magnetic fields in the line - forming region with strengths @xmath32  g would broaden and shift x - ray lines enough to make identification of the transitions and determination of the redshift and other stellar properties difficult ( loeb 2003 ) .",
    "however , the spin rates and other observed properties of neutron stars in lmxbs and the spin - down rates of recycled radio pulsars indicate that most neutron stars in lmxbs have magnetic fields @xmath33@xmath34  g ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ; lamb & yu 2004 ) , too weak to broaden fe lines by more than @xmath35  ev",
    ".    the spin rate of the neutron star in could be 45  hz either because it has not accreted enough matter to reach a higher frequency or because its field is strong enough to maintain spin equilibrium at 45  hz .",
    "accretion will double the spin rate @xmath16 of a star far from spin equilibrium in @xmath36  yr , where @xmath37 is the accretion rate and @xmath38  g  s@xmath39 is the eddington accretion rate onto a star with a 10  km radius ( see lamb & yu 2004 ) .",
    "the magnetic field required to maintain a 45  hz spin rate is @xmath40  g for accretion at the relatively high long - term average rate @xmath41 , or @xmath42  g for @xmath43 ( lamb & yu 2004 ) .",
    "the splitting produced by @xmath40  g would be @xmath35  ev , so it is unlikely that magnetic splitting dominates the line widths observed in , but it could contribute to them .",
    "a line produced at the surface of a star that is spinning rapidly may nevertheless appear narrow if it is intrinsically narrow and ( a )  the colatitude @xmath44 of the region where the line is formed is sufficiently small , ( b )  the observer s inclination @xmath30 relative to the spin axis is sufficiently small , or both angles are relatively small .",
    "for example , the observed width of fe lines formed at the surface of a @xmath45@xmath46star observed at @xmath47 is only @xmath35  ev if @xmath48  hz and @xmath49 , or if @xmath50  hz and @xmath51 .",
    "thus , narrow lines are possible even if @xmath52  hz , if they are preferentially formed near the rotation axis , as in a hotter region close to a nearly aligned magnetic pole ( in some evolutionary scenarios , alignment of the magnetic axis with the spin axis is expected ) .",
    "scattering lines with two flux minima are possible for emission from any part of a spherical surface only if the emission is beamed in the rest frame of the surface or there is general relativistic light deflection ; the depths of the resulting minima depend on the location and width of the emitting belt and @xmath30 .",
    "zel & psaltis ( 2003 ) showed that if the redshift @xmath53 at the surface of the star is estimated using the energy of the deepest minimum in the full line profile , the distortion of the line profile by special and general relativistic effects can introduce errors of tens of percent for stars with spin rates of hundreds of hz .",
    "our study confirms this result ( see fig .  2 ) .    we have found a way to reduce greatly the effects of the distortion of the line profile on measurements of @xmath53 . _",
    "using the quantity @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the geometric mean of the low - energy and high - energy edges of the observed line , yields very accurate estimates of @xmath53 , even if the line is broad and skewed .",
    "_ we explored this approach because , for surfaces rotating at speed @xmath56 toward and away from the observer , the lower- and higher - energy edges of the line are doppler shifted to @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the lorentz factor .",
    "@xmath60 is therefore exactly equal to @xmath29 in this geometry , when light - bending is neglected .",
    "our calculations show that using the geometric mean of the energies of the two flux minima also yields a very accurate estimate of @xmath53 .",
    "2 compares the value of @xmath61 estimated using @xmath60 with the true equatorial value of @xmath61 and the values estimated using ( a )  the geometric means of the energies of the lower- and higher - energy flux minima and edges of the line , ( b )  the arithmetic means of the energies of lower- and higher - energy flux minima and the energies of the lower- and higher - energy edges of the line , and ( c )  the energy of the deepest flux minimum in the line profile , assuming that the line is formed in the region between colatitude @xmath62 and the rotational equator @xmath63 .",
    "the error in @xmath61 is greater when @xmath61 is estimated from the energy of the deepest flux minimum in a line profile formed over a range of latitudes than in a line formed uniformly over the whole stellar surface ( see zel & psaltis 2003 ) , but the former geometry is probably more realistic .    the value of @xmath61 estimated using @xmath60 differs from the ratio of the star s equatorial radius @xmath64 to @xmath15 by less than 1.7% for @xmath65  hz ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "even if the line is formed over the whole surface of the star , the geometric mean gives a much better estimate of @xmath61 than does the energy of the deepest flux minimum .",
    "using the arithmetic mean of the energies of the two flux minima or the energies or the energy of the deepest flux minimum gives estimates of @xmath61 that differ from @xmath66 by up to 7.3% and 57.0% , respectively .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath61 deviates most from the true value when the star spins rapidly , @xmath61 is small ( for a fixed eos model and stellar spin ) , or the band is centered at the spin equator .",
    "we find that the accuracy is independent of the beaming parameter @xmath27 . in all of the combinations of parameters",
    "we have tried , the accuracy in @xmath61 using our method is better than 2% when @xmath67  hz . in figures  3 and 4",
    "we show the dependence of the estimates on the true values of @xmath61 and belt locations and widths .",
    "importantly , we have found a possible signature of frame - dragging in the line profile , which could be used to detect frame - dragging if @xmath68 is known to better than @xmath0% . as pointed out by the anonymous referee ,",
    "the effect of frame - dragging for a given angular velocity is to decrease the linear speed of the surface relative to the locally nonrotating frame ( also see poutanen & gierliski 2003 ) .",
    "the angular velocity of frame dragging at the surface is typically @xmath69% of the stellar spin rate . as seen in fig .  5",
    ", this affects the ratio of the depth of the low - energy ( red ) flux minimum to the depth of the high - energy ( blue ) flux minimum , which increases steeply with increasing @xmath70 , but either decreases or increases only slowly with variations of most other parameters .",
    "this effect is also produced by changing the linear surface speed at a fixed spin frequency , i.e. , by changing @xmath68 .",
    "because @xmath68 also affects the width of the full line profile , a precise @xmath71% ) measurement of line - width ( and hence @xmath72 could allow detection of frame - dragging effects .",
    "if such precision is possible ( e.g. , with a future high - throughput and high - resolution mission such as constellation - x ) , then the most robust way to detect this effect is to measure the overall asymmetry of the line , using as a reference the local flux maximum @xmath73 at @xmath74 , between the two flux minima at @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the photon flux is equal to @xmath73 at two other energies , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , but less than @xmath73 at all energies between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "there is therefore a `` red flux deficit '' from @xmath79 to @xmath74 relative to @xmath81 and a `` blue flux deficit '' from @xmath74 to @xmath80 relative to @xmath82 . like equivalent widths , these flux deficits depend only weakly on the detector s resolution , which will make this easier to detect in practice .",
    "if the required precision can be attained , we note that a quantitative measure of @xmath70 will provide a constraint on the properties of high - density matter that is independent of , e.g. , measurements of @xmath61 .",
    "5 illustrates the effect of @xmath70 on the flux deficit ratio , when the other parameters in the problem ( including @xmath16 ) remain fixed .",
    "both profiles are normalized by their maximum depths . in this example , the flux deficit ratio is @xmath83% greater for @xmath84 ( @xmath85  hz ) than for @xmath86 .    fig .",
    "6 demonstrates that the double flux minima remain visible even if other broadening mechanisms , such as zeeman splitting , make the intrinsic line width substantially greater than it would otherwise be .",
    "shown are the predicted profiles of lines with intrinsic halfwidths of @xmath87 ( the same as in the other line profile calculations reported here ) and @xmath88 ( half the halfwidth produced by rotational doppler broadening ) .",
    "the latter halfwidth is similar to the magnetic splitting produced by a @xmath34  g magnetic field , comparable to the field required to maintain a neutron star with a long - term average accretion rate @xmath89 in spin equilibrium at the 45  hz spin rate of .",
    "the discovery of line features in the spectrum of by cottam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) motivated us to explore the information that can be obtained from analysis of the profiles of atomic lines formed at the surfaces of neutron stars .",
    "we confirm the finding of villarreal & strohmayer ( 2004 ) that the widths of these features are consistent with formation at the surface of a star with a spin rate of 45  hz .",
    "we have also shown that stars with spin rates up to @xmath90  hz can produce lines this narrow if emission from close to the rotational axis dominates .",
    "confirmation of these features by future observations , or detection of surface lines from other lmxbs , will help strengthen and clarify this picture .",
    "we have demonstrated that the radius - to - mass ratio @xmath61 can be inferred from spectral line profiles with very little ( in general less than 2% ) systematic error , if the geometric mean of the energies of the two flux minima ( instead of the energy of the deepest flux minimum ) , or two line edges is used .",
    "observed line profiles can therefore be used to constrain eos models to the 5% accuracy required to distinguish between different equations of state ( lattimer & prakash 2001 ) .",
    "finally , we show that neutron star atomic spectral lines can be used to detect frame - dragging . such a detection would require observation of a line profile with two moderately well - resolved flux minima .    with the discovery of strong evidence for resonance scattering lines formed at the surface of one neutron star",
    ", it can be hoped that current and future x - ray missions will be able to detect more such spectral lines .",
    "a strong and well - resolved broad line would provide a wealth of information about the neutron star .",
    "one candidate line is the fe k@xmath1 line , given the expected surface temperature and abundance of iron in accreting sources .",
    "future x - ray spectroscopy missions will do even better . for example",
    ", constellation - x will have a resolution and an effective area several times greater than those of chandra and xmm .",
    "detection and precise measurement of the properties of atomic lines formed at the surfaces of neutron stars would open a new avenue for studying dense matter , neutron stars , and lmxbs .",
    "simultaneous observations of lines and burst oscillations by future , even more capable instruments could make possible phase - resolved line spectroscopy , using the light curve of the burst oscillation to determine the rotational phase of the star .    we thank arun v. thampan for providing the code used to compute the structure of rapidly spinning neutron stars and geoff ravenhall for providing tabulations of the a18@xmath14uix equation of state . we also appreciate the particularly useful comments about frame - dragging provided by the anonymous referee .",
