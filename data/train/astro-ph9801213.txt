    "the mere existence of qsos and their host galaxies at high redshift places interesting constraints on theories of large - scale structure and galaxy formation ( haehnelt & rees 1993 , efstathiou & rees 1988 ) .",
    "however , recent optical surveys have produced conflicting results for the qso space density at high redshift , due to the complicated selection effects introduced when picking out high - redshift qsos from more numerous galactic stars with similar optical colours .",
    "_ radio_-based selection methods have the advantage of simpler selection criteria .",
    "also , since radio emission is unaffected by dust , the intrinsic evolution of the qso population can be observed , unaffected by obscuration .",
    "qsos found in radio - based surveys provide an unbiased ( by the effects of dust ) sample of damped ly-@xmath7 absorption systems that can be used to study chemical abundances to the highest observable redshifts .",
    "since high - redshift quasars are rare , surveys to reach @xmath2 must cover a large area .",
    "we are carrying out two surveys using three radio samples that cover most of the sky to a limit of 0.25jy or fainter ( see figure  [ sky ] and caption ) .",
    "the northern survey uses the 0.2jy flat - spectrum sample of patnaik et al ( 1992 ) and the 0.1jy mg - vla sample ( lawrence et al 1986 ) , which together contain more than 4400 sources .",
    "the southern survey uses the revised parkes catalogue ( wright & otrupcek , 1990 ) . since these samples are defined at high frequency ( 5ghz for the northern samples and 2.7ghz for the parkes sample ) , they contain a high fraction of core - dominated flat - spectrum sources , usually identified with quasars . moreover , spectral index information is avaliable for all the sources , allowing us to select flat - spectrum objects .",
    "in addition the sources have accurate positions from the vla and/or the australia telescope , which are necessary for making unambiguous optical identifications .",
    "the first stage of optical identification is carried out using digitised sky - survey plates .",
    "ccd images are then obtained for the fainter sources .",
    "since the northern survey was aimed at finding high - redshift quasars , only the optically red , stellar identifications were followed up spectroscopically . for the parkes sample redshifts",
    "were obtained for all the stellar identifications .",
    "details of the two surveys are given below .",
    "poss - i plates in the e and o bands , scanned by the apm ( automated plate measuring facility , cambridge u.k . ) , were used to identify flat - spectrum ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) sources with @xmath10jy to the plate limit of @xmath11mag over an area of 3.7sr ( 12 000 sq deg ) .",
    "their colour magnitude diagram is shown in figure  [ colmag]a . since",
    "high - redshift quasars have redder optical colours than their low - redshift counterparts due to absorption by intervening ly-@xmath7 , only red ( @xmath12 ) , stellar identifications were followed up spectroscopically .",
    "this resulted in the discovery of 20 @xmath2 quasars ( hook 1994 , hook et al 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "another 5 @xmath2 qsos with radio fluxes @xmath13 were found in the region covered by the mg - vla sample .",
    "about 16% of the radio sources remained unidentified after this stage and b and r - band ccd identifications are being obtained for these .",
    "so far @xmath14 have been observed and a colour - magnitude diagram for those detected in the r - band is shown in figure  [ colmag]b . combining the poss - i and ccd identifications plus observations of these radio sources from the literature ( including the identification of one source as a qso with @xmath15 , vermeulen et al 1996 ) , an effective area of 2400 sq deg is now 97% identified .",
    "10 objects are still not identified to a limit of @xmath16mag .",
    "two new @xmath17 qsos were found during spectroscopy of the 10 reddest ccd identifications .",
    "one of these , at @xmath3 is the highest redshift radio source known ( hook & mcmahon 1998 ) .",
    "its spectrum is shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "it is also the highest redshift x - ray source known and is probably strongly beamed ( fabian et al 1997 ) .",
    "we are able to compute the luminosity function of radio - loud qsos at high redshift using the @xmath2 qsos discovered among the poss and ccd identifications .",
    "the distribution of the qsos on the radio - luminosity versus redshift plane is shown in figure  [ pz ] along with flat - spectrum qsos at @xmath18 from dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) . the binned luminosity function for these two data sets",
    "is shown in figure  [ lf ] .",
    "notice that the luminosity function at @xmath2 is lower than that at @xmath19 , particularly for sources of lower radio luminosity .",
    "initial identifications of flat - spectrum sources ( @xmath20 ) from the parkes catalogue were made by shaver et al ( 1996a ) using cosmos scans of ukst plates to a limit of @xmath21 .",
    "ccd identifications were obtained for the remaining optically - fainter sources . since",
    "all the stellar sources have been identified in the b band , shaver et al ( 1996a ) were able to conclude there are no @xmath22 qsos in the sample ( see the limit in figure  [ drop ] ) and hence there must be a drop - off in the space density of radio - loud quasars at @xmath2 .",
    "the next stage of this study , namely to obtain redshifts for a complete sub - sample of 442 stellar identifications ( quasars ) with @xmath23jy , has recently been completed .",
    "the most distant qso found in this sample has @xmath24 ( shaver et al 1996b ) .",
    "figure  [ drop ] shows a preliminary analysis of space density as a function of redshift for objects with radio luminosity greater than @xmath25 , corresponding to the flux limit of the sample at @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "the figure shows that the decline in space density of luminous parkes qsos at @xmath2 has a remarkably similar form to that seen in optically - selected samples of qsos .",
    "since the radio sample is unaffected by dust this suggests that dust has a minimal effect on the observed drop - off in space density of optically - selected qsos .",
    "this also has implications for the effect of dust on recent measurements of the star formation rate from high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we are working on quantifying this result in the context of the obscuration models of fall & pei ( 1993 ) .",
    "the results from the above surveys suggest that the peak in qso space density occurs at higher redshifts for stronger sources ( fig  [ rhoz ] ) .",
    "thus a survey to reach higher redshifts should concentrate on relatively bright objects and cover a large area , rather than reaching very faint limits over a small region .",
    "we are planning a very large survey for @xmath17 qsos , making use of new wide - area datasets .",
    "the survey covers 6000 sq deg and is based on flat - spectrum sources with @xmath29 from the 5ghz pmn sample . the 1.4ghz nrao - vla sky survey ( nvss , condon",
    "et al 1994 ) , which now covers the whole sky north of @xmath30 , will provide spectral index information and the accurate positions needed to make unambiguous optical identifications .",
    "the ukst i - band survey of the southern sky is now nearing completion and the plates are being scanned at the apm . as in the northern survey described above , candidate high - redshift qsos will be selected based on positional coincidence , red optical colour and ` stellar ' image classification . by using i - band plates",
    "this survey is sensitive to bright qsos out to @xmath31 .",
    "extrapolating our previous results to 50mjy , @xmath32 radio - loud objects with @xmath17 should be found ( @xmath33 times the number currently known ) plus up to 2 with @xmath22 .",
    "there are 4 main conclusions from this work .",
    "* radio surveys are efficient for finding high - redshift qsos .",
    "there are now many tens of @xmath2 radio - selected quasars known including gb1428 at @xmath3 , the third highest redshift quasar known . *",
    "the space density of radio - selected qsos shows a turnover at high - redshift ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "since radio emission is unaffected by dust , this decline at high redshift is not an effect of obscuration . *",
    "the decline in space density seen at high redshift has a similar form to that of optically - selected qsos . *",
    "the two previous results lead to the conclusion that the effect of dust on the observed qso drop - off is minimal .",
