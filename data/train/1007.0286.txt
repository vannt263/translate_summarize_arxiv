    "technicolor theory @xcite is one of the important candidates to probe new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , especially topcolor assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) model proposed by c. t. hill @xcite  it combines technicolor with topcolor , with the former mainly responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the latter for generating a major part of the top quark mass .",
    "if technicolor is actually responsible for ewsb , there are strong phenomenological arguments that its energy scale is at most a few hundred gev and that the lightest technicolor pions are within reach of the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "the tc2 model predicts three top pions ( @xmath5 ) , one top higgs ( @xmath6 ) and the new gauge bosons ( @xmath7 ) with large yukawa couplings to the third generation quarks , so these new particles can be regarded as a typical feature of this model .",
    "lots of signals of this model have already been studied in the work environment of linear colliders and hadron - hadron colliders @xcite , but most of the attention was focused on the neutral top pion and new gauge bosons . here",
    "we wish to discuss the prospects of charged top pions .",
    "the search for higgs bosons and new physics particles and the study of their properties are among the prime objectives of the lhc .",
    "recently , lots of studies about the neutral higgs production at the lhc have been finished @xcite . for the production of charged higgs boson in association with a @xmath0 boson in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , ref .",
    "@xcite investigates @xmath8 at the tree level and @xmath9 at one loop .",
    "the electroweak corrections and qcd corrections to @xmath8 have already been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows that a favorable scenario for @xmath10 associated production would be characterized by the conditions that @xmath11 and that @xmath12 are either close to unity or of order @xmath13 , then the @xmath14 bosons could not spring from on - shell top quarks and could be so copiously produced at hadron colliders .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have already studied the process of @xmath15 associated production via @xmath1 annihilation at the tree level , which shows that the total cross section @xmath16 is rather large when @xmath17 is not very heavy . in this paper",
    "we shall discuss the production of top pions @xmath18 in association with sm gauge bosons @xmath19 including the contributions arising from top pions @xmath20 and top higgs @xmath6 , and calculate the total cross section to one - loop order , to search for new physics particles and test the tc2 model .",

    "the mandelstam variables are defined as @xmath29    the self - energy coupling between @xmath30 and @xmath31 has no contribution to their renormalization fields and masses since @xmath31 is a pseudo- goldstone boson and @xmath32 is a gauge boson .",

    "we can observe that ( i ) the cross section is not sensitive to @xmath89 , and only decreases by @xmath117 in the range of @xmath118 for @xmath119 ; and ( ii ) the case of @xmath108 is almost the same as that of @xmath106 .     the relative correction to the cross section , @xmath120 , as a function of @xmath97 with @xmath121 , @xmath122 gev and @xmath123 ( solid line ) , 0.06 ( dashed line ) , and 0.1 ( dot - dashed line ) . ]     the relative correction versus @xmath89 for @xmath110 ( solid line ) , 350 gev ( dashed line ) , and 450 gev ( dot - dashed line ) , respectively . ]    in order to look at the contributions of the one - loop feynman diagrams , we plot the relative correction @xmath124 as a function of @xmath97 and @xmath89 in figs . [",
    "fig : eps4]-[fig : eps5 ] , in which @xmath125 denotes the corresponding total cross section at the tree level . from these two diagrams",
    ", we can find that ( i ) for the case of @xmath119 , the relative correction @xmath124 is positive , and decreases with the increases of @xmath97 and @xmath89 , but this decrease is rapid with @xmath97 and is slow with @xmath89 at the changing from @xmath126 to @xmath101 ; ( ii ) for the case of @xmath108 , the relative correction is slightly larger than that of @xmath106 ; and ( iii ) the value of the relative correction , in general , is about a few percent to two dozen percent , this means that the contribution from the one - loop corrections can afford a more distinct change than that of the tree level .",
    "as is known , at the lhc , the integrated luminosity is expected to reach @xmath127 per year , this shows that a cross section of @xmath128 could translate into about 60 detectable @xmath129 events per year @xcite .",
    "looking at figs .",
    "[ fig : eps2 ] and [ fig : eps3 ] , we thus conclude that , if @xmath110 , depending on @xmath89 , one should be able to collect an annual total of between @xmath130 and @xmath131 events .",
    "so the @xmath93 signal should be clearly visible at lhc unless @xmath97 is very large .",
    "moreover , the total cross section will enhance a few percent to two dozen percent arising from the one - loop technicolor corrections .",
    "we know there are mainly two parton subprocesses that contribute to the hadronic cross section @xmath132 : the @xmath1 annihilation and the @xmath133 fusion . in this paper , we only focus on the discussion of the @xmath1 annihilation . for the @xmath133 fusion , there is no tree - level contribution to the subprocess @xmath134 in the tc2 model , however , at the one - loop level , the process @xmath4 can be induced by quark - loop diagrams including the triangle diagrams and the box diagrams . calculating the contributions of these diagrams .",
    "we can find that , the cross section of @xmath135 is between @xmath136 and @xmath137 for reasonable ranges of the parameters , and the changes of @xmath138 with the parameters @xmath97 , @xmath109 and @xmath89 are very similar to those of @xmath1 annihilation at the tree level given in the figs . [",
    "fig : eps2 ] and [ fig : eps3 ] .",
    "whereas the production cross section based on @xmath4 can be comparable to that via @xmath139 due to the large number of gluons in the high energy proton beams at the lhc .",
    "the total cross section of @xmath93 associated production at the lhc should be the sum over these two parton subprocesses .    in conclusion",
    ", we have calculated the technicolor corrections to the cross section for @xmath93 associated production via @xmath1 annihilation at the cern lhc in the topcolor assisted technicolor model .",
    "we find that , the total cross section of @xmath140 at the tree level , is roughly corresponding to that of the process @xmath141 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , and can reach a few hundred femtobarns with reasonable values of the parameters . considering the technicolor corrections arising from the one - loop diagrams ,",
    "the relative correction is about a few percent to two dozen percent .",
    "the size of the cross section via the subprocess @xmath142 is calculated .",
    "thus , it is so large that the signal of charged top pion should be clearly visible at lhc .",
