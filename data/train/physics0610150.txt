    "the time asymmetry existing in a turbulent flow governed by the navier - stokes equation has recently been discussed in the connection with the diffusion properties of two nearby fluid particles initially close to each other .",
    "a stochastic model study by @xcite showed that backwards dispersion is faster than the corresponding forwards dispersion .",
    "this has practical implications for a variety of applications dealing with transport and mixing in turbulent flows .",
    "the asymmetry was experimentally verified by a particle tracking velocimetry ( ptv ) experiment by @xcite who speculated that kinematic infinitesimal material line stretching has its counter - part in the inertial range .",
    "different stretching rates could then explain the observed difference in forwards and backwards dispersion . through a finite reynolds number formulation of the much celebrated richardson law @xmath0",
    "it was found that following two particles backwards in time the dispersion was faster by a factor of approximately two compared with following the particles forwards in time .",

    "one can expect kolmogorov similarity scaling to hold for the coarse - grained quantities as long as the filtering scale is less than the integral scale in the flow where the turbulence is solely represented by the kinetic energy dissipation of the flow , @xmath3    as in @xcite we define the coarse - grained velocity gradient tensor to be @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the coarse - grained velocity over scale @xmath6 : @xmath7 here @xmath8 denotes a ball with radius @xmath9 and @xmath10 its volume .",
