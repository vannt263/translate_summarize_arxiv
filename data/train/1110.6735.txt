    "nowadays , it is widely regarded that the cosmological constant @xmath0 or more generally dark energy is the most responsible candidate which explains accelerating expansion of universe .",
    "nonetheless the details of cosmological constant @xmath0 or dark energy are still far from clear , then it is preferable and worthy to clarify the validity of this hypothesis by means of not only cosmological observations but also another astronomical / astrophysical ones .    among such attempts , it would be the most natural idea to investigate the role of cosmological constant @xmath0 in the classical tests of general relativity , e.g. the perihelion advance of planetary orbit and the bending of light path .",
    "so far , it was shown that the cosmological constant @xmath0 causes the perihelion shift of planets at least in principle , even though its contribution is too small to detect in the current measurement technique ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    while it has been believed for a long time that @xmath0 does not contribute to the light deflection because there is no @xmath0 in the second - order ordinary differential equation ( ode ) of photon .",
    "however recently , rindler and ishak @xcite pointed out that @xmath0 does affect the bending angle by using the schwarzschild - de sitter or kottler metric and the invariant formula of cosine .",
    "subsequently many authors argued its appearance in diverse ways and generality assisted the fact that there appears @xmath0 in the deflection angle @xmath1 , see @xcite for review and the references therein and also @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that the conclusion has not converged yet ; for instance whether the leading order effect of @xmath0 is coupled with the mass of central body @xmath5 or not and so on . in order to clear up the confusion",
    ", we will revisit the effect of the cosmological constant on the light deflection and its role in the cosmological lens equation .",
    "before discussing the influence of @xmath0 on bending angle @xmath1 , we shall begin with re - considering the solution of photon trajectory in the schwarzschild spacetime . from the schwarzschild metric in the schwarzschild",
    "coordinates , @xmath6 and the condition for null geodesic @xmath7 , we have the geodesic equation for equatorial plane ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 in which the two constants of motion , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are total energy and angular momentum , respectively .",
    "alternatively , eq .  ( [ eq : geodeq1 ] ) can be expressed in the form of second - order ode as , @xmath12 nevertheless , hereinafter we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq1 ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq2 ] ) .    in order to obtain the photon trajectory up to the second - order in @xmath2 ,",
    "let us put the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq1 ] ) @xmath13 as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , first @xmath17 and second @xmath18 order correction to zeroth - order solution @xmath19 ( straight line ) .",
    "hence @xmath15 and @xmath16 satisfy the following differential equations , @xmath20 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] noting that the integration constants of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1st - eq ] ) and ( [ eq:2nd - eq ] ) are chosen such that maximizing @xmath13 ( or minimizing @xmath21 ) for @xmath22 , then we obtain the trajectory of photon up to the second - order in @xmath2 as , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the impact parameter which represents the minimum value of @xmath21-coordinate for the undeflected light ray , i.e. , @xmath25 . the bending angle @xmath1 is shortly derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : trajectory1 ] ) and it coincides with the famous formula by @xcite , @xmath26 a simple derivation of @xmath1 is given in appendix [ b ] .",
    "it should be mentioned about the validity of the solution for light trajectory .",
    "the appropriateness of our solution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : trajectory1 ] ) can be verified readily by the direct substitution into eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq1 ] ) and it is found that the residual terms are order @xmath27 , then it is perfectly valid up to the order of @xmath28 .",
    "however , the photon trajectory given in previous works such as eq .  ( 18 ) of @xcite and eq .",
    "( 16 ) of @xcite are incorrect ; in fact , there appears @xmath18 order residual term in the solution of photon trajectory in @xcite .",
    "now , let us investigate the contribution of @xmath0 on light ray . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the schwarzschild - de sitter or kottler metric @xcite , @xmath29 in the same way as the schwarzschild case , the differential equation of light is given by @xmath30 it should be emphasized here that the geodesic equation of light eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq3 ] ) does obviously include @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , previous arguments , such as `` @xmath0 does not appear in the geodesic equation of light '' , would be overstated . actually , the second - order ode derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq3 ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq2 ] ) , nevertheless its solution of light trajectory should be obtained in such a way that the integration constants satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the impact parameter is the minimum value of the coordinate @xmath21 if the light ray were undeflected , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq3 ] ) that the impact parameter @xmath31 in this case is defined by @xmath32 then , the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq3 ] ) completely coincides with eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq1 ] ) , except that the impact parameter @xmath24 is replaced by @xmath31 . therefore , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq3 ] ) becomes , @xmath33 and deflection angle is , @xmath34 it is worthy to note that the contribution of @xmath0 is incorporated in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : trajectory2 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_angle2 ] ) through eq .",
    "( [ eq : impact ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", it is found that the cosmological constant @xmath0 does appears in both the geodesic equation and its solution , that is the trajectory of photon .",
    "however , the effect of @xmath0 is completely absorbed into the definition of the the impact parameter ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : impact ] ) ) .",
    "hence it is difficult to distinguish the influence of @xmath0 from the observed deflection angle .    when we expand eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_angle2 ] ) by using @xmath35 and remain @xmath36 terms , it follows that @xmath37 in which second term coincides with the previous results , e.g. eq .  ( 5 ) and below in @xcite and the third term of eq .  ( 15 ) in @xcite .",
    "hence it is found that these results are included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_angle2 ] ) as a limiting case .",
    "it is clear that the trajectory of photon eq .",
    "( [ eq : trajectory2 ] ) strictly satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodeq3 ] ) up to the second - order in @xmath2 based on the result in previous section .",
    "finally , we consider the contribution of @xmath0 in the cosmological lens equation . under the assumption that the thin lens approximation is valid , the lens equation relates the observed image position angle @xmath38 to the unlensed position angle @xmath39 of the source as @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the angular diameter distance from the redshift @xmath42 to @xmath43 , and the arguments @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the redshift of the lens and the source , respectively . for the distance formula @xmath4 in the unperturbed friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe with @xmath0 ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    up to the first order in @xmath2 , the bending angle @xmath1 in the present case is @xmath46 the impact parameter @xmath31 is related to the image position angle @xmath38 by @xmath47 then , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lenseq1 ] ) , ( [ eq : lensangle ] ) , and ( [ eq : cosmolens ] ) , the lens equation is finally @xmath48 therefore , the contribution of @xmath0 is completely involved in the form of the angular diameter distance @xmath4 .",
    "no modifications due to @xmath0 appear even if the term of @xmath18 in @xmath1 is included . it should also be noted that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lenseq2 ] ) is exactly the same form appeared in @xcite , where the authors have shown that the gravitational lensing effects are strongly dependent on the value of the cosmological constant and hence they provide us with useful means to test the cosmological constant .    here",
    ", we mention that in paper @xcite , sereno introduced the relation , @xmath49 ( see eq .",
    "( 8) below of @xcite ) where @xmath50 is the impact factor of `` schwarzschild lens '' ( see eq .",
    "( 8) of @xcite ) , @xmath51 is the angular - diameter distance , and",
    "@xmath52 is the angular separation . since in the case of cosmological lens , the cosmological distance , such as the angular diameter distance ,",
    "is defined with @xmath0 , then @xmath50 should be replaced by @xmath31 , instead .",
    "we briefly summarize our conclusions .",
    "contrary to the previous arguments , ( a ) the cosmological constant @xmath0 does appear in the orbital equation of light , ( b ) nevertheless the bending angle of light @xmath1 does not change its form even if @xmath3 since the contribution of @xmath0 is thoroughly absorbed into the definition of the impact parameter , and ( c ) the effect of @xmath0 is completely involved in the angular diameter distance @xmath4 .",
    "then , no modifications due to @xmath0 appear even if the second - order terms in @xmath2 are included .",
    "it should be mentioned that the similar conclusions are reached by other authors @xcite .",
    "we hope that this paper provides a simpler and clearer explanation of the role of @xmath0 in the bending of light and the cosmological lens equation than the above - mentioned studies .",
    "rindler and ishak @xcite have derived the angle between the radial direction and the light trajectory from the invariant cosine formula . just for a reference , here we give a more intuitive derivation . consider a spherically symmetric space .",
    "the metric on the equatorial plane @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 in this space , the infinitesimal proper lengths along the radial direction and that perpendicular to the radial direction are given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "then the tangent of the angle @xmath57 between the radial direction and the light trajectory is @xmath58 which is the same form as eq .",
    "( 16 ) in @xcite .",
    "once we obtain the solution @xmath59 for the light trajectory , eq .",
    "( [ eqa2 ] ) gives the angle at any point @xmath60 on the trajectory .",

    "using eqs .  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq : trajectory1 ] ) and ( [ eqa2 ] ) , the angle @xmath57 at the point @xmath62 is @xmath63 consider a flat space which is tangent to the asymptotically flat region of the schwarzschild geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is apparent from the property of an isosceles triangle in the euclidean geometry that the angle @xmath57 at the point @xmath64 is a half of the bending angle @xmath1 ( see fig .",
