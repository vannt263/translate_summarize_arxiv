    "the energy splitting of the ground - state doublet of the @xmath2th nucleus is only several electron volts  @xcite . at the same time",
    "the exact value of the frequency for the transition from the isomeric @xmath0th state to the ground @xmath1th state is unknown .",
    "experiments give values of this frequency @xmath5 ranging from @xmath6 ev  @xcite to @xmath7 ev  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the lifetime of the isomeric state performed by different experimental groups lead to values which differ from each other by many orders of magnitude ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    as was noted in  @xcite the nuclear transition from the isomeric state to the ground state",
    "is of a great interest since it makes it possible to build a very precise nuclear clock .",
    "this transition is very sensitive to hypothetical temporal variation of the fundamental constants  @xcite .",
    "the triply ionized @xmath8th was recently laser cooled  @xcite .",
    "further , this experimental group plans to investigate the nuclear transition between the isomeric and the ground state in a cold @xmath2th@xmath9 ion .",
    "another experimental group  @xcite plans to use the ion @xmath2th@xmath3 to study the nuclear @xmath0th@xmath1th transition .",
    "in our previous work  @xcite we considered the @xmath2th@xmath9 ion and calculated the transition probability of the @xmath2th nucleus from its lowest energy isomeric state @xmath0th to the ground state @xmath1th due to the electronic bridge ( eb ) process . in this paper we consider the more complicated three - valence ion @xmath2th@xmath3 . in our approach",
    "we do not fix the value of the nuclear transition frequency .",
    "hence , the result obtained here can be applied for any value of @xmath5 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_gf ] we briefly discuss the general formalism describing the eb process . in sec .",
    "[ sec_mc ] we describe the method of calculation of the properties of th@xmath3 . section  [ sec_rd ] is devoted to the results of calculations and sec .",
    "[ sec_c ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "atomic units ( @xmath10 and the speed of light @xmath11 ) are used throughout .",
    "a derivation of the equation for the probability of the eb process , @xmath12 , is given in detail in  @xcite .",
    "for this reason we will repeat here only the main features of the formalism .",
    "the eb process can be represented by the two feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : eb ] .        in the following",
    "we assume that the initial @xmath13 and the final @xmath14 electronic states are of opposite parity and fixed .",
    "a real photon which is emitted or absorbed is the electric dipole photon .",
    "the eb process can be effectively treated as the electric dipole @xmath15 transition of the electron accompanied by the nuclear transition from its isomeric state to the ground state .",
    "because the exact value of the nuclear transition frequency is unknown we do not fix it in our calculation . using the experimental data we suggest that most probably the real value of @xmath5 is between 2 and 8 ev . the general expression for @xmath12 we used for calculation of the eb process for @xmath2th@xmath9 can be simplified for @xmath2th@xmath3 .",
    "this is due to the spectrum of th@xmath3 being much denser than the spectrum of th@xmath9 . as a result , for any nuclear transition frequency @xmath5 lying between 2 and 8 ev we can find an atomic transition from the initial state @xmath13 to the definite intermediate state @xmath16",
    "whose frequency will be very close to @xmath5 .",
    "assuming the resonance character of the eb process we arrive at the following expression for @xmath12  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the magnetic dipole nuclear moment and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the ground nuclear state and the isomeric nuclear state ( @xmath21 , [ 633 ] nilsson state and @xmath22 , [ 631 ] nilsson state ) ; @xmath23 is the electron total angular momentum of the initial state , @xmath24 is the real photon frequency determined from the law of conservation of energy as @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the atomic energy ) , and @xmath27 can be approximated by @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the electronic magnetic - dipole hyperfine coupling operator .",
    "the total hyperfine coupling hamiltonian @xmath30 may be represented as @xmath31 the operator @xmath32 is the electric dipole moment operator , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 encapsulates all other electronic quantum numbers .",
    "the explicit expressions for the matrix elements of the operators @xmath29 and @xmath32 are given in our paper  @xcite .",
    "if we introduce the quantity @xmath35 then eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath36 in eqs .",
    "( [ g1])([g1new ] ) the electronic state @xmath37 is assumed to be fixed .",
    "this state should be chosen to meet two conditions : 1 ) @xmath38 and 2 ) if the first condition is fulfilled for two atomic states we should take the state for which @xmath39 is larger .",
    "the second condition is important because in certain cases the coefficients @xmath39 for two neighboring energy levels differ by several orders of magnitude .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we used the dimensionless quantity @xmath40 defined as the ratio of the probability of the eb process , @xmath12 , to the probability of the @xmath41 radiative nuclear @xmath42 transition , @xmath43 : @xmath44 it is reasonable to choose the ground state ( @xmath45 ) @xmath46 as the initial state @xmath13 and consider the lowest lying odd - parity state ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 as the final state @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the intermediate atomic states contributing to @xmath27 are even - parity states and our purpose is to calculate the coefficients @xmath39 for all even - parity states whose transition frequencies to the ground state are between 2 and 8 ev .",
    "then , using eqs .",
    "( [ g1new ] ) and ( [ betam1 ] ) we can find the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath40 , correspondingly , for any @xmath5 lying between 2 and 8 ev .",
    "we consider th@xmath3 as the atom with three valence electrons above closed - shell core [ 1@xmath49 ,  , 6@xmath50 .",
    "we employ the approach combining the configuration - interaction ( ci ) method in the valence space with many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) for core polarization effects . in the following we refer to this combined approach as the ci+mbpt method  @xcite .    at the first stage we have solved dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) equations  @xcite in the @xmath51 approximation .",
    "this means that the dhf equations were solved self - consistently for the core electrons .",
    "after that we determined the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 orbitals from the frozen - core dhf equations .",
    "the virtual orbitals were determined with the help of a recurrent procedure  @xcite .",
    "the one - electron basis set included 1@xmath5718@xmath57 , 2@xmath5817@xmath58 , 3@xmath5916@xmath59 , and 4@xmath1415@xmath14 orbitals on the ci stage .",
    "the configuration spaces for even - parity and odd - parity states were formed as follows .",
    "the main configuration of the ground state is @xmath60 .",
    "we formed the configuration space for the even - parity states by allowing single , double , and triple excitations from the @xmath60 configuration to the 7@xmath5713@xmath57 , 7@xmath5812@xmath58 , 6@xmath5911@xmath59 , and 5@xmath1410@xmath14 shells .",
    "the main configuration of the lowest lying odd - parity state is @xmath61 .",
    "the configuration space for the odd - parity levels was formed by single , double , and triple excitations from the @xmath61 configuration to the 7@xmath5713@xmath57 , 7@xmath5812@xmath58 , 6@xmath5911@xmath59 , and 5@xmath1410@xmath14 shells .",
    "inclusion of all possible ( up to triple ) excitations is important , especially for high - lying states . it allows us to take into account most completely the configuration interaction for all considered states .    in the ci+mbpt method ,",
    "the energies and the wave functions are determined from the eigenvalue equation in the model space of the valence electrons , @xmath62 where the effective hamiltonian is defined as @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the relativistic three - electron hamiltonian in the frozen - core approximation and @xmath65 is the energy - dependent core - polarization correction .",
    "together with the effective hamiltonian @xmath66 we introduce the effective electric - dipole operator @xmath67 and the operator @xmath68 acting in the model space of valence electrons .",
    "these operators were obtained within the relativistic random - phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite , which describes a shielding of the externally applied electric field by the core electrons .",
    "the rpa sequence of diagrams was summed to all orders of the perturbation theory .    to solve the rpa equations and to calculate diagrams for the effective hamiltonian and the effective operators @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath29 we used a different basis set .",
    "the core orbitals in this basis set are the same as before , but the number of virtual orbitals is much larger .",
    "on the whole , it consisted of @xmath69@xmath70 , @xmath71@xmath72 , @xmath73@xmath74 , @xmath75@xmath76 , and @xmath77@xmath78 orbitals .",
    "we start the discussion of the results with the following remark : the spectrum of th@xmath3 is very complicated .",
    "as is seen from the experimental data  @xcite , on the one hand , the states belonging to different configurations strongly interact with each other and @xmath79 coupling is not valid ( even approximately ) for this ion . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not a chaotic system . respectively , the methods of statistical physics are not applicable .",
    "such an `` intermediate '' type of coupling makes the calculations of the properties of th@xmath3 rather difficult .    as we have already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec_gf ] , we consider the following transition : @xmath80 . according to eqs .",
    "( [ g1 ] )  ( [ g1new ] ) only intermediate states @xmath16 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 contribute to the probability of the eb process for this transitions .    in tables  [ tab:1 ] and [ tab:2 ] we presented the calculated values of the energy levels with @xmath81 and @xmath82 and",
    "also @xmath4 factors and the coefficients @xmath39 obtained with use of eq .",
    "( [ rn ] ) for the most interesting frequency range from 2 to 8 ev . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we present the results for the atomic frequencies from 2 to 5 ev and in table  [ tab:2 ] ( which is a continuation of table  [ tab:1 ] ) the data are listed for the frequencies from 5 to 8 ev .",
    "the results for the energy levels and @xmath4 factors were obtained in the ci+mbpt approximation .",
    "the values of the coefficients @xmath39 were found in the frame of the ci+mbpt+rpa approach .",
    ".the low - lying energy levels in the range from 18119 to 40644 @xmath83 ( from 2 to 5 ev ) in the ci+mbpt approximation , @xmath4 factors , and the coefficients @xmath39 ( in a.u . ) .",
    "@xmath84 is the difference between the energies of the ground state and the excited state .",
    "the notation @xmath85 $ ] means @xmath86 .",
    "the theoretical values are compared with the experimental data . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "to conclude , we have found several high - lying even - parity states with total angular momenta @xmath46 and @xmath48 that are not identified in the atomic spectra database  @xcite .",
