    "nonlinear interaction ( collision ) of gravitational waves ( gws ) in einstein s theory , which was initiated long time ago by the two letters to nature @xcite@xcite is a well known subject by now @xcite@xcite . as an outcome of this process we quest whether it is possible to probe controllable electromagnetic ( em ) waves in sensing the passing of a strong gw . given the known exact solutions to einstein s field equations to date the answer is affirmative . after encounter with a gw , the physical changes in the em wave will inform about the latter .",
    "we recall that the first indirect evidence of gws from the binary pulsar in the early 1970s , by the team of r. hulse and j. taylor also was based on em observations .",
    "the main feature on which we concentrate here is the rotation of em polarization vector known as the faraday effect .",
    "such rotation has been introduced also for the gws @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , however its detection is hampered by the challenge of detecting gws themselves .    in this paper",
    ", we propose that given its faraday rotation after encountering with a gw , a linearly polarized em wave signals the passage of a gw . for a thorough analysis gws may be considered in three different profiles .",
    "the first ( and simplest ) , albeit idealized , is an impulsive gw whose possible sources are cosmic bursts , supernova explosions , collision of black holes , etc .",
    "it is dubbed `` idealized '' in the sense that it arises as a limit of a gaussian curvature .",
    "the second profile of interest is shock type with a uniform curvature .",
    "the third type is a hybrid sandwich gw that lies intermediate to the aforementioned ones . in the sequel",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the two types alone .",
    "the general form of plane waves known as the rosen form is described by the line element @xmath0 \\cosh w-2\\sinh wdxdy\\right\\ }   .\\ ] ]    the metric functions depend only on the null coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the plane wave regions",
    ", all metric functions appeared in this line element depend only on either @xmath1 or @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we  shall be interested in the metric function @xmath3 which represents the second polarization content of the waves .",
    "in our analysis , we consider the interaction of linearly polarized plane em waves with a cross polarized gws that propagate in the opposite directions in each of the incoming regions as illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "region iii @xmath4 , contains linearly polarized plane em wave described by the line element @xmath5    where @xmath6 is only a function of @xmath2 . the only non - trivial einstein - maxwell equation in this region is given by @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 stands for the ricci tensor .",
    "region ii @xmath10 , contains plane gw described by @xmath11    in which@xmath12 and @xmath13 depend only on @xmath1 and are constrained by the vacuum einstein equation @xmath14    now , we rotate the @xmath15 axes by angle @xmath16 to align them along with @xmath17 at the cost of creating a cross polarization term in ( 4 ) .",
    "the two waves , em from left and gw from right make a head on collision on the hypersurface specified by @xmath18 .",
    "physically the cross @xmath19 mode of the gw will rotate the linear @xmath20 mode of the em wave giving rise to the faraday effect in the em wave .",
    "irrespective of the initial data the einstein - maxwell equations admit the following metric and maxwell fields in the interaction region @xmath21 @xcite ; @xmath22   , \\\\ \\phi_{0 }   &   = \\left (   \\frac{-g^{^{\\prime}}}{2\\sqrt{f+g}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}-g}}\\right )   e^{i\\beta(u)},\\nonumber\\\\ \\phi_{2 }   &   = -\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}-g}}{2\\sqrt{f+g}}\\left (   v^{^{\\prime}}\\cosh w+iw^{^{\\prime}}\\right )   e^{i\\beta(u)},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which the phase function @xmath23 is to be determined from @xmath24 ( a prime implies derivative with respect to the argument for each function ) .",
    "the incoming em shock wave with @xmath20 mode is characterized by the function @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the energy ( frequency ) constant and @xmath27 with @xmath28 the unit step function .",
    "the initial data for the gw are ; @xmath29    where @xmath30 is to be understood with the step function , i.e , @xmath31 the resulting solution for both cases is summarized as follows ; @xmath32 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while @xmath33 and @xmath34 functions are readily available from ( 7 ) and ( 8) .",
    "we note that @xmath16 is confined by @xmath35 before collision the em wave is linearly polarized along the @xmath36-axis .",
    "the polarization vector of the incoming em wave which was aligned with the @xmath36-axis does not preserve its linear form after interacting with the gravitatinal wave . in an orthonormal tetrad @xmath37",
    ", the line element can be expressed by @xmath38    the electric and magnetic field components are defined by @xcite @xmath39    the faraday rotation angle @xmath40 is determined from the electric field components of the em wave by @xmath41    in which @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the em spinor components given in eq .",
    "( 6 ) . in terms of metric functions ,",
    "the faraday rotation angle is    @xmath44    in the case of gravitational plane impulsive wave and for the particular angle @xmath45 , eq.(13 ) becomes @xmath46    where @xmath47 the behavior of this expression for various @xmath26 values is illustrated in figure 2 . the behavior for shock gravitational wave case which can be obtained  in anology to eq .",
    "( 14 ) also from the eqs .",
    "( 8 - 13 ) is given in figure 3 .",
    "since the @xmath2 dependence in @xmath48 is periodic , one would expect to see this behavior explicitly .",
    "however , due to the curvature singularity that the spacetime possesses on the hypersurface , @xmath49 , we have to choose @xmath50 and @xmath51 such that @xmath52 for all ( @xmath53 ) . as a result of this constraint condition",
    "the @xmath2 dependence does not display its periodic character in this range .",
    "figures 2a , 2b and 2c represent the impulsive wave plots for the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "similarly for the shock gravitational waves the curvature singularity occurs on the hypersurface @xmath56 the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 confined to @xmath57 @xmath51 must be chosen in such a way to satisfy @xmath58 the figures 3a , 3b and 3c illustrate the shock wave plots for @xmath54 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "our study shows that highly energetic em waves ( i.e. greater @xmath26 ) udergo rotation shortly after their encounter with the gw , while for the less energetic beams this effect is delayed .",
    "smooth variations , beside the local extrema is another noticable effect in different plots .",
    "one fact , however , is evident that an em wave reflecting from a cross polarized gw undergoes a faraday rotation .",
    "further details of this effect can be obtained by studying more plots .",
    "our result applies also to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation as well as the radio astronomical fields . in other words , rotation in the polarization vector in the cmb radiation",
    "can be attributed to the encounters with the strong @xmath19 moded gws .",
    "considerations of mixed profile gws and sandwich waves will be the subject of a detailed analysis .",
    "let us remark that encountering of an em wave with a series of succesive impulsive gws has already been considered @xcite .",
    "search for gws through the faraday rotation due to a test em wave in a gw background has been considered by various authors @xcite,@xcite .",
    "distinctly , our method takes the full non - linear effects into account by employing the cross polarization mode of gws .",
    "in this paper ,  by using einstein s theory of general relativity , we have analysed the exact behavior of the polarization vector of a linearly polarized em shock wave upon encountering with gws .",
    "expectedly , the faraday s angle emerges highly dependent on the type of the gw as well as the energy of the em wave .",
    "it suggests that compared with the polarization changes expected from the quantum process of photon - electron scattering in the early universe , or test field approximations , significant contributions to the polarization vector can be imparted by the classical em - gw collisions .",
