    "an important consequence of quantum gravity scenarios is the existence of a minimum length .",
    "since the heisenberg uncertainty principle does not exert any restriction on the measurement precision of the particle s positions or momenta , there is no minimum measurable length in the usual heisenberg picture . in the past few years",
    ", quantum mechanics with modification of the usual canonical commutation relations has been investigated intensively@xcite-@xcite .",
    "such works , which are motivated by string theory and quantum gravity , suggest a minimal length as @xmath0 .",
    "this means that there is no possibility to measure coordinate @xmath1 with accuracy smaller than @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a positive parameter and depends on the expectation value of the position and momentum operators @xcite . since in string theory",
    "the minimum observable distance is the string length , @xmath4 is proportional to this length .",
    "if we set @xmath5 , the usual heisenberg algebra is recovered . in low energy limit , these quantum gravity effects can be neglected , but in circumstances such as the very early universe or in the strong gravitational field of a black hole one has to consider these effects .",
    "the modification induced by the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) on the classical orbits of particles in a central force potential has been considered in @xcite .    alternatively , it could be argued that a fundamental length in nature may have dramatic impacts on our universe .",
    "also , it could be seen that this length may be related to vacuum energy , i.e. dark energy @xcite .",
    "the introduction of @xmath6 in the formalism of gup has been studied in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most of different analyses are performed by introducing an ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - off on the planck scale@xcite .",
    "but , other works introduce an infrared ( ir ) cut - off by using the so - called q - bargmann fock formalism @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", if we impose the @xmath7 as uv cut - off and the cosmological constant @xmath6 as an ir one , the uv scale is dual to the ir one .    in this paper , we are going to proceed to study the effects of gup on the kepler problem .",
    "the main consequence of this work is the constraint imposed on the minimal observable length and the parameter @xmath3 in comparison with observational data of mercury .",
    "also , by comparing the value of the perihelion shift of mercury in schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime with the resulted value of gup , we obtain a relation between the minimal length and the cosmological constant .",
    "now if the cosmological constant is time dependent , we will have a minimal length to vary with time .",
    "this matter could be important in quantum gravity scenarios for studying the early universe and black hole physics .",
    "finally , we investigate the stability of circular orbits of planets in this framework .",
    "we show when the angular momentum of the planet is large , the condition for stability of circular orbits differs considerably from classical mechanics .",
    "we consider the commutation relation with the gup as @xmath8 = i \\hbar ( 1+\\beta p^{2})\\delta_{ij},\\label{eq1}\\ ] ] this commutation relation implies the minimal length uncertainty relation @xmath9 which appears in perturbative string theory @xcite . if the components of the momentum @xmath10 are assumed to commute with each other @xmath11=0 , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] then the commutation relation among the coordinate are determined as @xmath12=2 i\\hbar\\beta ( p_{i}x_{j}-p_{j}x_{i } ) .",
    "\\label{eq4}\\ ] ] since the commutation relations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) do not break the rotational symmetry , the generators of rotations can be expressed in terms of the position and momentum operators as follows @xmath13 in the classical limit , using the poisson bracket , we can write equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) as follow @xmath14    the poison bracket must possess the same properties as the quantum mechanics commutators , namely , it must be anti - symmetric , bilinear and satisfy the leibniz rules and the jacobi identity .",
    "therefore , we can derive the general form of the poisson bracket for any functions of the coordinates and momenta as @xmath15 also , we can obtain the time evolutions of the coordinates and momenta as follows @xmath16 now we can use these equations to study the motion of a macroscopic object . in this paper , we consider hamiltonian of a particle in a central potential @xmath17 the time evolution of the coordinates and momentums became @xmath18 where we have neglected terms of the order of @xmath19 . for motion in central force potential , the @xmath20 s are conserved due to rotational symmetry @xmath21 .",
    "the conservation of the @xmath22 s imply that the motion of the particle will be confined to a 2-dimensional plane spanned by the coordinate and momentum vectors at any point in time .",
    "now , by using equations ( [ eq9 ] ) we can drive the equation of motion of a particle @xmath23 in the next section , we study the kepler problem in this framework .",
    "as we know that the kepler potential is @xmath24 , so the equation ( [ eq11 ] ) became @xmath25 since @xmath26 is a very small parameter and @xmath27 is very large , we can ignore the second term in comparison with the first term .",
    "in spherical coordinates , the equations above can be written as @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 we assume the case of the plane orbit that is a valid solution , and for simplicity we consider the equatorial orbits i.e @xmath31 . then the above equations become as follows @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 according to equation ( [ eq18 ] ) , @xmath35 is a constant of motion so equation ( [ eq16 ] ) becomes @xmath36 now , for the right hand side of the equation above , we consider a new potential as @xmath37 the second term in parenthesis is very small compared to one .",
    "so , by neglecting it we have @xmath38 as can be seen , the contribution of the radial components of the kinetic energy is less than ordinary classical mechanics by one .",
    "here we shall solve equation ( [ eq19 ] ) to obtain the orbits of planets in the solar system .",
    "first , we define @xmath39 then @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the radial equation ( [ eq19 ] ) changes to @xmath42 on the other hand , in the classical kepler problem we have @xmath43 solving this equation we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . now for solving equation ( [ eq23 ] ) , to first order in @xmath3 , we suggest @xmath47 where @xmath48 must satisfy @xmath49.,\\label{eq27}\\ ] ] by solving the equation above we obtain @xmath50,\\label{eq28}\\ ] ] so we have @xmath51+\\frac{\\delta}{b^{2}}(1 + e^{2}),\\label{eq29}\\ ] ] that @xmath52",
    ". then we can obtain the perihelion shift per revolution as @xmath53 using the variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mass of the sun , we have @xmath57 in the equation above , @xmath26 the same as @xmath58 and @xmath56 is constant . in the case of the mercury planet , using the data @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we found @xmath65 as @xmath66 for consistency with the observational results , the @xmath67 must be small .",
    "then we conclude that the parameter @xmath68 must be very small and the planetary system is very sensible in this parameter .",
    "so , small changes in @xmath3 implies sensible changes at very large scales .",
    "in other words , there is a connection between the physics at small scales and the physics at large scales .",
    "now , we consider the observed perihelion shift of mercury as @xcite @xmath69 if it is assumed that @xmath70 , we can obtain @xmath71 and @xmath72 note that this limit is @xmath73 orders of magnitude below the planck length . however , for a best comparison it will be necessary to study the shift to the perihelion in a curved space . as we know ,",
    "in the case of general relativity with the schwarzschild - de sitter metric , the shift to the perihelion is @xcite @xmath74 so , for the perihelion shift of mercury @xmath75(\\frac{rad}{rev}),\\label{eq37}\\ ] ] now , if @xmath6 is of the order of @xmath76 @xcite , the second term above is the of same order as the observational error .",
    "since the effect of spacetime quantization for a composite macroscopic body is much weaker than one of the constituent particles @xcite , we should consider the effect of gup on the perihelion shift as a perturbation effect which is very small . using this assumption , we can find a upper bound for @xmath3 as @xmath77 then we obtain @xmath78 and @xmath79 by defining @xmath80 the equation ( [ eq40 ] ) can been written as @xmath81 if @xmath82 then @xmath83 and vice versa .",
    "it means that the cosmological constant of the spacetime is related to the minimal observable length . without a the minimal length ,",
    "there is no cosmological constant and vice versa .",
    "it can been seen that the minimal length @xmath84 and the cosmological constant scale @xmath85 could be dual of each other@xcite-@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is an extensive literature suggesting that the relation @xmath86 plays a fundamental role in cosmology ( here @xmath87 is the hubble parameter ) @xcite .",
    "this relation has been obtained in a number of empirical models @xcite.the dependence @xmath86 explains the current observations successfully and provides a more accurate age for the universe .",
    "according to this relation , the cosmological constant varies with cosmic time and therefore the minimal length of spacetime decays with time .",
    "this matter could be very important in quantum gravity scenarios such as string theory .",
    "for studying the stability of the planet circular orbits , we start from equation ( [ eq16 ] ) . using the general form of a central force @xmath88 we have @xmath89 then , by considering @xmath90 ,",
    "the effective potential can be written to first order in @xmath3 as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the mass of the planet and in a planet orbit @xmath93 .",
    "now , the conditions of a stable circular orbit are @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the radius of orbit . therefore , we should have @xmath96 and @xmath97 from the equation ( [ eq47 ] ) we have @xmath98 using this result , the second condition for stability of circular orbits in central force can be written as @xmath99 this condition for stability differs from the one in general classical mechanics .",
    "when @xmath100 this results in @xmath101 which is a known condition in general classical mechanics .",
    "however , when @xmath102 , the condition for stability of circular orbits depends on the angular momentum .",
    "since @xmath26 is too small , the second term in equation ( [ eq49 ] ) is effective when the angular momentum of the planet is very large .",
    "also , @xmath103 could have non - integer values .",
    "in this paper , we have investigate the effects of gup on the kepler problem .",
    "in other words we found the equation of motion and the perihelion shift of the planets in this framework .",
    "also , by comparing the value of the perihelion shift of mercury in schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime with the resulted value of gup , we showed that the minimal length @xmath84 and the cosmological constant scale @xmath104 could be dual of each other .",
    "since the cosmological constant could depend on the hubble parameter , we concluded that the minimal length of the spacetime varies with cosmic time . in the end",
    ", we studied the stability of circular orbits of planets and showed that the condition for stability is different from general classical mechanics , if the angular momentum of the planet is very large .",
