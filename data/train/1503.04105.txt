    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor structures based on monolayer ( ml ) transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) show very strong light - matter interaction , with an absorption of the order of 10% per ml in the visible region of the optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "this strong interaction can be explored in microcavity physics and for laser and light emitting diode ( led ) devices .",
    "the optical properties of ml tmdcs are governed by strongly bound excitons ( binding energy is of the order of @xmath5  ev ) @xcite .",
    "the absence of an inversion centre in the lattice of tmdc mls together with the strong spin - orbit ( so ) interaction in these materials leads to a coupling of carrier spin and @xmath6-space valley dynamics . as a result the circular polarization ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) of the absorbed or emitted photon",

    "excitonic resonances do not only dominate single- and two - photon absorption , but also strongly influence second harmonic generation ( shg ) @xcite and interactions with plasmons @xcite .",
    "the exact symmetry , degeneracy and energy spacing of the exciton levels is still under debate . to address the spin- and valley - dependent fine structure of excitonic levels we perform magneto - optical experiments on ml tmdcs , where the magnetic field lifts the underlying degeneracies and extract the effective land factors , a technique successfully used in the past to study the bandstructure and excitonic effects of semiconductors @xcite .",
    "+ very recently lifting of the @xmath9-valley degeneracy through the application of a magnetic field perpendicular to the monolayer plane has been reported for mose@xmath0 @xcite and wse@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "an energy splitting @xmath12 between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 polarized photoluminescence ( pl ) components has been reported , which correspond to inter - band recombination in the @xmath10- and @xmath11-valley , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the splitting @xmath12 increases roughly linearly with the applied magnetic field , although the values reported for ml wse@xmath0 differ by a factor of up to 3 @xcite .",
    "the aim of this comparative study is to perform experiments on mose@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 monolayers in magnetic fields up to @xmath13  tesla in the same set - up , and to measure the neutral exciton and trion emission energy and polarization .",
    "we vary the laser excitation energy and helicity , which allows us to distinguish between the laser induced and magnetic field induced valley polarization , which show very different dependencies on the applied magnetic field when comparing mose@xmath0 with wse@xmath0 monolayers .",
    "wse@xmath0 and mose@xmath0 flakes are obtained by exfoliation  @xcite of a bulk crystal on a sio@xmath0/si substrate .",

    "we can infer that the mechanical movement of the detection and excitation spot on the sample due to the strong applied magnetic fields is at most in the tens of  nm range in our set - up .",
    "the detection spot diameter is about @xmath16  nm . the sample is excited either by a he - ne laser ( 1.96  ev ) or by a tunable continuous wave ti : sa laser .",
    "the average laser power is in the @xmath17w range , in the linear absorption regime .",
    "the pl emission is dispersed in a double - monochromator and detected with a si - ccd camera .",
    "the spectral resolution of this detection system is @xmath18ev .",

    "light is @xmath7 ( right circularly polarized ) if electric field vector rotates with time clock - wise provided one looks along the light propagation axis .",
    "similarly the linear pl polarization in the fixed @xmath22 axes lying in the sample plane writes @xmath23 with @xmath24 the @xmath25 and @xmath26 linearly polarized emission components .",
    "first we discuss the experimental results for mose@xmath0 mls . at zero magnetic field , we observe in the pl spectrum two sharp emission features with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 10  mev . in accordance with previous reports @xcite , the low energy emission at 1.63  ev is attributed to the charged exciton ( trion ) recombination and at 1.67  ev we record the neutral exciton x@xmath28 emission , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b . in our measurements",
    "the circular polarization degree @xmath19 of the trion and x@xmath28 emission depends only very little on the excitation laser polarization ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) for the excitation laser energy of 1.96  ev used in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b .",
    "the maximum @xmath19 generated was of the order of 5% for the excitation energy range investigated @xcite , much lower than the pl polarization achieved for circular laser excitation in mos@xmath0 @xcite and wse@xmath0 mls @xcite .",
    "below we discuss the magnetic field dependence of the pl emission , whose energy and polarization are essentially independent of the excitation laser polarization , in stark contrast to the results obtained in ml wse@xmath0 discussed in sec . [",
    "sec : wse2 ] .",
    "next we discuss the changes observed in the pl emission when applying a magnetic field @xmath1 perpendicular to the layer plane , i.e. along the @xmath29-direction , that is also the light propagation axis ( faraday geometry ) . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a at @xmath30  t and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b at @xmath31 we observe two main differences : ( i ) for @xmath32 the @xmath7 polarized emission is more intense than the @xmath8 polarized component , for both the trion and x@xmath28 ; ( ii ) the @xmath7 polarized emission is shifted to lower energy compared to the @xmath8 polarized component . when applying a field of @xmath33 t in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]c , these results are reversed , i.e. @xmath8 emission becomes more intense and lower in energy compared to @xmath7 in agreement with time - reversal symmetry . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]d we plot the full magnetic field dependence of the energy splitting @xmath34 from @xmath35  t to + 9  t with @xmath36 being the effective @xmath36-factor and @xmath37 being the bohr magneton .",
    "the zeeman splitting is extracted by fitting the trion and x@xmath28 emission spectra with lorentzians .",
    "we observe a clear linear dependence both for the trion and x@xmath28 splitting on the applied field .",
    "this indicates that eventual diamagnetic and higher order contributions are identical for the upper and lower zeeman branch within our experimental resolution .",
    "the slope is @xmath38ev / t for the x@xmath28 which corresponds to an exciton @xmath36-factor of @xmath39 . for the trion",
    "the slope is @xmath40ev / t which corresponds to a @xmath36-factor of @xmath41 .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum @xmath42  mev at 9 tesla .",
    "the main experimental uncertainty for @xmath12 comes from eventual changes of the overall shape of the pl emission due to imperfections in the optical set - up and sample inhomogeneities , as the recorded shifts are smaller than the linewidth .",
    "the land - factors for trions and the x@xmath28 in ml mose@xmath0 extracted from our date are close to the values reported in @xcite .",
    "+ it is worth mentioning that trions that form with the excess electron in the same or different valley , with respect to the photo - generated electron hole pair , are separated in energy due to the strong coulomb effects and the zero - field splitting of conduction band states in each valley , cf .  @xcite .",
    "however , we do not observe any fine structure splitting for the trion emission in the investigated sample .",
    "hence , the measured @xmath43 represents the global magnetic field induced energy shift of the trion emission .",
    "+ we now discuss the circular polarization of the observed emission summarized in figs .  [",
    "fig : fig1]f and [ fig : fig1]g . for the trion",
    ", @xmath19 increases from zero to 30% when the magnetic field is increased from zero up to 9  t. this strong polarization is reversed when the direction of the applied magnetic field is reversed .",
    "optical valley initialization at higher fields is not at the origin of this effect : for @xmath7 polarized laser excitation we observed exactly the same polarization increase with field as for @xmath8 polarized laser excitation .",
    "we conclude that the pl polarization is the result of magneto - induced spin / valley polarization build - up during the pl emission time , which has been determined to be in the ps - range @xcite .",
    "observing an increase in the emission polarization in applied magnetic fields is a very common observation in semiconductors @xcite . for ml mose@xmath0 , where excitons have a strong binding energy @xcite ,",
    "this observation is very surprising taking into account the relevant energy scales . at 9 tesla",
    ", we have induced a splitting between the valley zeeman levels of 2  mev , eventually comparable to the spin splitting in the conduction band , predicted to be in the mev range @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the neutral exciton follows a similar trend as the trion . for the neutral exciton",
    ", the applied field @xmath1 can dominate the long - range electron - hole coulomb exchange interaction , and hence suppress valley depolarization when @xmath1 has a larger amplitude than the effective transverse field associated to exchange effects @xcite .",
    "in order to draw more general conclusions on valley properties in applied magnetic fields , we compare our results in ml mose@xmath0 with a very well characterized system , namely ml wse@xmath0 @xcite investigated with the same experimental set - up .",
    "therefore all experimental uncertainties are comparable . in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2]b the pl emission of ml wse@xmath0 is plotted , and just as in the case of ml mose@xmath0 , we observe two well defined emission lines with a typical fwhm of 10  mev . the higher energy transition at 1.75  ev is identified as the neutral exciton x@xmath28 recombination , as valley coherence can be generated @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]e .",

    "[ fig : fig2]d the full magnetic field dependence of the zeeman splitting for the trion and x@xmath28 .",
    "the experimental points are very close to a straight line , which allows us to extract for the x@xmath28 a slope of @xmath47ev / t , corresponding to the neutral exciton @xmath36-factor @xmath48 . for the trion",
    "the slope is @xmath49ev / t , resulting in its @xmath36-factor @xmath50 .",
    "the similarities between the measured land - factors in mose@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 are striking , both with respect to their signs and amplitudes , see table [ tab : table1 ] . comparing with the very recent literature data on ml wse@xmath0 , the @xmath36-factors for the neutral exciton extracted for our sample are smaller than reported in reference @xcite and larger than in reference @xcite .",
    "note , that as for mose@xmath0 case we do not resolve any fine - structure of the trion emission in wse@xmath0 .",
    "although the zeeman energy evolution of the both ml materials mose@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 shows close similarities , we will see below that the evolution of the valley polarization as a function of the applied magnetic field is completely different .",
    "the polarization measurements on wse@xmath0 are all performed with non - resonant hene laser excitation .",
    "first , we plot the evolution of the x@xmath28 pl polarization under polarized pumping , that corresponds to the valley polarization generation via the chiral optical selection rules @xcite , as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]f that the x@xmath28 polarization is essentially independent of the applied field . for a linearly polarized excitation laser",

    "this value remains practically constant in applied fields from @xmath53  t to @xmath54  t. this indicates that over the entire magnetic field range , the x@xmath28 emission polarization is determined by the initially , optically created valley polarization rather than induced by the magnetic field . during the x@xmath28 pl emission time",
    "no valley / spin relaxation occurs , which might simply be a consequence of the extremely short pl emission time in the few ps range measured for this material @xcite .",
    "exciting preferentially the @xmath11 valley with a @xmath8 polarized laser , results in @xmath55 , again independent of the applied magnetic field .",
    "this behaviour for the x@xmath28 in ml wse@xmath0 is in stark contrast to the observations in ml mose@xmath0 . for the former",
    ", the optical valley initialization determines the pl polarization , for the latter the applied magnetic field direction and amplitude allow to control the valley polarization . comparing with the recent literature ,",
    "the x@xmath28 polarization in the ml wse@xmath0 sample investigated by @xcite was slightly more sensitive to the applied magnetic field .",
    "contrary to the x@xmath28 in our ml wse@xmath0 sample , the trion polarization in this ml can be controlled via the applied magnetic field , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]g . for linearly polarized laser excitation ,",
    "the trion pl polarization for @xmath31 is absent , @xmath56 , but increases at @xmath53  t to @xmath57 , and at @xmath54  t to @xmath58% .",
    "this can be directly compared to the trion in ml mose@xmath0 , that also started off at zero field with zero polarization . when comparing the trion polarization evolution in ml mose@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]g ) and ml wse@xmath0 ( fig .",

    "the trion polarization depends on both the excitation laser polarization and the applied magnetic field .",
    "this latter dependence might be linked to the fact that the pl emission time of the trion in ml wse@xmath0 is longer than for the x@xmath28 @xcite , allowing for polarization relaxation to occur before radiative recombination takes place . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]g , the magnetic field induced change in pl polarization is also observed for @xmath8 excitation , here we find at @xmath35  t @xmath63 , while for zero field we record @xmath64 ( as expected when switching from @xmath7 to @xmath8 excitation ) evolving towards @xmath65 for @xmath35  t. the three different measurement series presented in fig .",

    "the emission energies and polarizations are determined by several factors .",
    "most importantly , the zeeman splittings of exciton and trion in the emission spectra are governed by an interplay of spin splittings of conduction and valence band states , while the polarization is governed by ( i ) selection rules at optical transitions , ( ii ) occupancies of the spin / valley states and possible spin relaxation processes . here",

    "the difference of measured values for excitons and trions can be attributed to the coulomb - induced renormalization of @xmath36-factors due to band non - parabolicity .      the polarization of the pl emission is governed by the selection rules and occupancies of spin / valley states of the carriers and coulomb complexes . in case of mose@xmath0 , neither optical orientation ( circular polarization of photoluminescence for circularly polarized excitation at @xmath175 ) nor exciton alignment or valley coherence ( linear polarization at linearly polarized excitation ) are observed @xcite .",
    "this allows us to assume that in this material the spin / valley relaxation of both neutral excitons and trions ( or individual carriers ) is fast compared to the pl emission time . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "the magneto - induced circular polarization seems to result from the preferential occupation of the lowest zeeman state of the exciton or trion .",
    "it is indeed consistent with experiment where , for @xmath176 , the state emitting the @xmath7-polarized photons has the lower energy and is dominant in the photoluminescence so that @xmath177 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "note , however , that the full thermalization to the lattice temperature does not occur because at @xmath178  t the zeeman splitting exceeds by far the temperature expressed in the energy units , while experiment demonstrates only @xmath179  % .",
    "the effective spin temperature deduced from the experiment is about @xmath180  k.    the situation is more complex for wse@xmath0 where the experiment shows a substantial optical orientation , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]f , and neutral - exciton alignment , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]e , even at @xmath31 . in this case",
    "the spin / valley relaxation time is comparable to the lifetime of excitations and , in an applied magnetic field , thermalization may not occur .",
    "additionally , as compared to mose@xmath0 , wse@xmath0 is characterized by the opposite sign of zero - field spin splitting of the conduction band  @xcite .",
    "hence , for the exciton and trion ground states the direct intra - valley optical transitions are spin - forbidden .",
    "these states can be manifested in optical spectra due to indirect ( e.g. phonon - assisted ) transitions similarly to the case of carbon nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "it follows from the symmetry considerations that in this case the polarization is reversed  @xcite .",
    "further experimental data using gated devices where positively and negatively charged excitons can be clearly distinguished and theoretical analysis are needed to clarify this issue .",
    "finally we emphasize that the above analysis is based on the perturbative treatment of the coulomb interaction while , in tmdc mls , the exciton binding energy amounts to @xmath181  ev and , hence , is comparable to the band gap .",
    "theoretical estimates show that depending on the parameters of the materials and dielectric environment the binding energy is so large that the @xmath182 state emission could be in the infra - red range and , moreover , the exciton ground state could even collapse  @xcite . in the former case",
    "the optical transition @xmath183 could be relevant as well , its zeeman splitting and polarization deserve further study . in the latter case the ground state of the system",
    "could be strongly renormalized and an excitonic insulator could be formed  @xcite .",
    "its polarization and magnetic field properties should also be studied in future works .    _",
