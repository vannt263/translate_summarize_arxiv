    "there has been considerable interest in the study of collective phenomena in small colliding systems since the initial discovery of long - range azimuthally collimated di - hadron correlations in high multiplicity proton - proton collisions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "while the systematics of the measured _ ridge - like _ correlations have been confronted by both hydrodynamic and color glass condensate inspired models ( see @xcite for a recent review ) the origin and nature of the high multiplicity events are far from being understood . the strength of the near - side azimuthal correlation is observed to grow monotonically with event activity up to the highest measured multiplicities having about ten times the mean number of charged tracks which can only be accounted for by rare fluctuations of the proton wave function .    a recent work has shown that a combination of impact parameter and color charge fluctuations are insufficient in describing the broad width of multiplicity distribution in p+p collisions @xcite . in order to accommodate the data additional event - by - event fluctuations of the saturation scale in the proton must be included .",
    "while this goes beyond the conventional color glass condensate framework , the existence of such fluctuations has been known for almost a decade @xcite as recently emphasized in @xcite where it was shown that saturation scale fluctuations of the proton are required to understand the centrality dependence of the charged particle rapidity distribution in p+pb collisions . by including event - by - event fluctuations of the initial proton saturation momenta within classical yang - mills simulations the authors of @xcite",
    "were able to describe the broad tail of the multiplicity distribution lending credence to the importance of rare fluctuations in generating dense nuclear configurations .",
    "the goal of this work is to demonstrate that the two - particle correlation function in rapidity , @xmath3 , can serve as a sensitive probe of the distribution of saturation scale fluctuations of the proton .",
    "it provides constraints on the variance , @xmath1 , of the logarithm of the saturation scale about its mean ( _ i.e. _ minimum bias ) position due to fluctuations occurring in the tail of the dipole scattering amplitude .     and @xmath4 .",
    "the event averaged @xmath5 is shown as the thicker blue curve .",
    "the conversion between rapidity @xmath6 and pseudo - rapidity @xmath7 was done in the same manner as @xcite . ]",
    "the basic idea is that partonic fluctuations in the proton result in a spread of saturation scales about the mean value .",
    "since the saturation scale of the two protons involved in the collision fluctuate independently one expects an asymmetric single particle rapidity distribution , @xmath8 , on a per - event basis .",
    "figure  [ fig : a1mc ] shows a model calculation of the rapidity distribution from a subset of events drawn from the distribution of equation  [ eq : prho ] .",
    "the event averaged @xmath5 is shown as the thicker blue curve .    on a per - event basis",
    "the single particle rapidity distribution can be characterized by fluctuations about the mean rapidity distribution @xmath9 in the above expression @xmath10 characterizes event - by - event fluctuations in the multiplicity while @xmath11 captures the asymmetry in the rapidity distribution @xcite on a per - event basis , due in our model to the unequal saturation scales of the colliding protons .",
    "we should stress that strictly speaking equation  [ eq : dndy ] characterizes the per - event rapidity distribution in the limit of a large number of particles when statistical fluctuations are negligible . in order for experiments to obtain information on the dynamical fluctuations encoded in @xmath12 and",
    "disentangle these from statistical fluctuations it is necessary to measure the two - particle correlation function . by construction",
    "the event averaged @xmath13 , for @xmath14 must vanish and we therefore focus on the root - mean - square values of the event - by - event @xmath15 via the quantities @xmath16 , which can be extracted from the two - particle correlation function  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18    as is evident from figure  [ fig : a1mc ] the per - event @xmath10 and therefore @xmath19 is highly sensitive to saturation scale fluctuations .",
    "these event - by - event multiplicity fluctuations are related to the multiplicity distribution itself , and while saturation scale fluctuations have recently been shown necessary to explain the tail of the multiplicity distribution @xcite additional sources must also be included such as impact parameter fluctuations , fluctuations due to conservation laws , statistical fluctuations , etc .",
    "unambiguously disentangling saturation scale fluctuations from other possible sources will require additional observables .",
    "the asymmetric correlator @xmath20 vanishes for symmetric colliding systems , such as p+p as considered in this work .",
    "due to the independently fluctuating saturation scales of the two protons an event - by - event asymmetry with respect to @xmath6 is seen in figure  [ fig : a1mc ] .",
    "the nature of the event - by - event asymmetric rapidity distribution can be captured by the coefficient @xmath21 in the above expansion of the two - particle correlation .",
    "one advantage of looking at rapidity asymmetric fluctuations , is that many of the more mundane sources of fluctuations that contribute to the multiplicity will not contribute to the coefficient @xmath21 due to their rapidity symmetric particle production .",
    "this will be discussed further in section  [ sec : discussion ] .    in what follows a simple model",
    "is presented , that will allow us to derive a relation between the experimentally measured @xmath21 and the variance , @xmath1 , of the proton saturation scale .",
    "consider the single inclusive rapidity distribution for a generic asymmetric nucleus - nucleus collision @xcite valid outside of the fragmentation region of the two nuclei , @xmath22\\left ( 2+\\ln \\frac{\\mathrm{max}[q_{1}^{2},q_{2}^{2}]}{\\mathrm{min}[q_{1}^{2},q_{2}^{2}]}\\right)\\ , .",

    "the rapidity dependence enters through the evolution of the saturation scale with @xmath6 as @xmath23where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the _ initial _ saturation scales in the two projectiles before evolution to the final saturation scales @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "as shown in @xcite the dispersion in the final saturation scales are caused by fluctuations in the low density tail of the initial condition and can be realized by averaging over the initial saturation momenta drawn from a gaussian distribution in the logarithm of the saturation scale , @xmath28=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi } \\sigma } \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{\\rho ^{2}}{2\\sigma ^{2}}\\right]\\,\\,\\,\\ , { \\rm where}\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\rho\\equiv \\ln\\left(\\frac{q^2}{{\\bar{q}_{}^{\\:2}}}\\right)\\ , .",

    "phenomenological fits of deep inelastic scattering data at small-@xmath45 @xcite constrain @xmath46 within this range .",
    "the horizontal band in figure  [ fig : a1data ] is representative of the data from minimum bias proton - proton collisions at @xmath47  tev .",
    "the band is centered at @xmath48 corresponding to the atlas collaboration measurement  @xcite at @xmath49 and the thickness of the band is two standard deviations @xmath50 .",
    "we should caution the reader that the atlas collaboration has used very narrow centrality classes and that a more direct comparison with data would use the same centrality cuts as the experiment .",
    "this is left to future work .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : a1data ] shows that a value of @xmath1 in the range @xmath51 is consistent with the experimental data .",

    "p+pb rapidity distributions @xcite ( @xmath53 ) .     from equation  ( [ eq : a1 ] ) as a function of @xmath1 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the horizontal bar is representative of the data on @xmath56 in minimum bias p+p collisions recently available by the atlas collaboration @xcite . ]",
    "there are a number of caveats that should be discussed before a quantitative extraction of @xmath1 is undertaken .",
    "first , the model under consideration in this work only includes intrinsic fluctuations of the proton saturation momentum .",
    "it is well known that in order to have quantitative agreement with the multiplicity distribution both impact parameter and color charge fluctuations must be included .",
    "however , it is plausible that many sources of fluctuations that contribute to the multiplicity have a smaller effect on the asymmetric coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "for example , impact parameter fluctuations from a radially symmetric proton will produce a symmetric rapidity distribution in each event and will therefore not contribute to @xmath57 .",
    "the color charge fluctuations as included in @xcite will also not contribute  the results of @xcite are boost invariant in each event .",
    "more generally color charge fluctuations , with quantum evolution , may introduce a forward - backward asymmetry on an event - by - event basis but we expect them to be suppressed by @xmath58 where @xmath59 represents the length scale of the color charge fluctuations and @xmath60 the collision overlap area .",
    "in this paper we calculated the two - particle correlation function originating from the intrinsic fluctuations of the saturation scales in two colliding protons .",
    "clearly this mechanism correlates not only two particles but also leads to multi - particle rapidity correlations . in reference",
    "@xcite it was argued that higher order correlation functions naturally remove unwanted short - range rapidity correlations , e.g. , resonance decays . in this work we focused on correlations after the experimental subtraction of the short range component .    in conclusion , we demonstrated that intrinsic fluctuations of the proton momentum saturation scale leads to an event - by - event asymmetric single particle distribution , @xmath8 , and consequently to nontrivial rapidity correlations .",
    "we extracted the asymmetry coefficient @xmath57 that directly measures the width of saturation scale fluctuations , that is , @xmath57 is roughly proportional to @xmath61 , the width of gaussian fluctuations in logarithm of the saturation scale , see figure  [ fig : a1data ] . when compared to the preliminary atlas data we conclude that @xmath1 is of the order of @xmath51 .",
