    "the superconducting ( sc ) state of a superconductor is protected by a energy gap .",
    "the symmetry and structure of the energy gap can be very different in different sc materials .",
    "for the conventional superconductors ( e.g. metallic superconductors ) , the gap is isotropic in the k space which is called the s - wave symmetry  @xcite . in some materials ( e.g. mgb@xmath2 ) , multlple gaps have been discovered on different fermi surfaces  @xcite .",
    "highly anisotropic ( the so - called d - wave ) gap symmetry was confirmed in high-@xmath4 cuprate superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the iron - pnictide superconductors , because there are typically four or five bands crossing the fermi level .",
    "theoretically several candidates symmetries of the sc gap(s ) were proposed  @xcite , among which the so - called s@xmath6 case seems to be accepted widely  @xcite . on the experimental sides , the nodeless superconductivity has been confirmed in ( k , tl)@xmath7fe@xmath8se@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "however , nodes ( zero points ) have been reported in the gap(s ) of lafepo , kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 , and bafe@xmath2(as@xmath0p@xmath7)@xmath2  @xcite . at the same time",

    "specific heat is a bulk tool to detect the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , which can provide information about the gap structure .",
    "the variation of the electronic sh in the sc states ( @xmath9 ) versus temperature can be rather different for different gap structures  @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the magnitude of the energy gap . in order to segregate the pure electron sh from the measured mixed contributions ,",

    ", we reported the clear presence of @xmath5 term in @xmath12 of the overdoped ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath13as@xmath13 from the raw data , giving a more solid evidence for the line - nodal gap structure  @xcite .",

    ", we studied the the low temperature sh of the ni - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 in the overdoped region . here",

    "the actual ni concentrations were checked and determined by the energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) measurements on a bruker quantax200 system .",

    "the thermometers has been calibrated under different magnetic fields beforehand .",
    "the external field was applied perpendicular to the @xmath19 axis of the single crystal .",

    "the mapping image of ni concentration and the chart of its distributions throughout an area of 38 @xmath15m@xmath1428 @xmath15 m for our sample are shown in figures 1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the spatial resolution is 1.9 @xmath15 m .",
    "the distribution shows a peak at about 0.058 , which is very close to the average value .",
    "consequently , this value is taken as the actual doping level .",
    "the sc transition of the obtained single crystal was checked by the dc magnetization and specific heat measurements . as shown in figure 2(a ) , the clear sc transition at about 14.8 k can be seen from both the @xmath20 and @xmath21 curves , indicating a high quality of the selected sample .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows schematically the phase diagram of the present ni - doped system , which were reported by n. ni et al  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that our sample locates on the overdoped sides of the phase diagram and no magnetic order exists in this region , which supplies a clean platform to study the behaviors of specific heat .",
    "we focus our attention on the sh data in the low temperature range to study the low - energy excitations . generally speaking , in a system without magnetic order or magnetic impurities ,",
    "the total sh is a simple integration of different components , @xmath22 the first term is the phonon sh , which is a very good approximation for the debye model in the low temperature region . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the second term @xmath9 is the electronic sh in the sc states excited by the thermal energy .",
    "this is the most important and concerned in our study , because its responding behavior to temperature supplies the information of the gap structure .",
    "the third term is quite complicated . under zero field , it is a residual electronic term typically coming from small amounts of non - superconducting content in the sample or impurity scattering in some unconventional superconductors  @xcite . with a field higher than the lower critical field , it reflects the contribution of the vortex states . here",
    "we plot the raw data of sh as @xmath23 vs @xmath5 in figure 3 .",
    "a clear feature in this figure is the negative curvature in all the curves under different fields , rather than a linear behavior as revealed by the dashed pink line .",
    "this behavior is not expected for the sc gap with an s - wave symmetry or point nodes . in the case of s - wave ,",
    "the value of @xmath9 is negligibly small in the low temperature region due to the exponential relation . for systems with point nodes ,",
    "the contribution of @xmath9 have the same @xmath24-dependence as the phonon term . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath23 - @xmath5 curves should show a linear behavior in the present low temperature region . intuitively , the case of gap with line nodes is the best candidate .",
    "consequently , we fitted our data using eq .",
    "( 2 ) based on the line nodal situation ( @xmath25 ) . as represented by the solid lines ,",
    "the fitting results are shown in figure 3 .",
    "one can see that the fitting curves coincide the experimental data very well .",
    "this gives a direct evidence for the presence of line nodes in the energy gap .",
    "to further confirm the reliability of the analysis , we checked the obtained fitting parameters carefully .",
    "we show the field dependence of the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 in figure  4 ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is almost independent of field , which is reasonable because magnetic field ca nt affect the phonon sh .",
    "moreover , @xmath29 decreases monotonously with the increase of magnetic field up to 9 t. this is similar to that observed in overdoped ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath7)@xmath2as@xmath2 , and has been attributed to the combined effects imposed by the three - dimension dispersion of the line nodes on the fermi surface and the destruction of v - shape of the density of states ( dos ) at the nodes by the field  @xcite . the residual value of @xmath28 under zero field ( denoted as @xmath30 )",
    "is estimated to be 0.75 mj / mol k@xmath31 , which is also comparable to the reports in overdoped ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath7)@xmath2as@xmath2 and suggests a high sample quality . a clear increase of @xmath28 with the field is observed .",
    "it is difficult to describe the field dependence of @xmath28 using a simple formula due to the multi - band effect in the present system .",
    "qualitatively , @xmath28 increases more quickly in the system with a highly anisotropic gap . at the present stage",
    ", we could not evaluate the information supplied by the field dependent data , since the upper critical field @xmath32 and the normal state electronic sh coefficient @xmath33 are not clear .",
    "the clear data and reasonable fitting parameters give us the confidence about the credibility of the present analysis process .",
    "more importantly , very few fitting parameters involve in this approach .",
    "however , we ca nt obtain the precise location of the line nodes , since sh measurements integrate the information from different directions of the fermi surface .",
    "most likely , the magnitude and structure of the gaps on different fermi surfaces are rather different .",
    "we must emphasize that such a multi - band does not destroy the validity of our analysis results because the electronic sh from the fermi pockets with line nodes will prevail that from fully gapped pockets in the low temperature limit .    in summary , we studied the low - temperature specific heat on the ba(fe@xmath0ni@xmath1)@xmath13as@xmath13 single crystal with @xmath3 = 0.058 . before measurements ,",
    "the single crystals were carefully annealed to improve the sample quality .",
    "we found a clear evidence for the presence of @xmath5 term from the raw sh data , which is consistent with the theoretical prediction for the superconductors with line nodes .",
    "our result is very similar to the previous reports on the co - doped system .",
    "future investigations on other systems of the iron - pnictide superconductors are needed to check whether it s a common feature for the presence of line nodes on the overdoped sides of the electron doped 122 system .",
