    "the interaction of a collection of atoms with a radiation field has always been an important topic in quantum optics . the dicke model ( dm ) which describes interaction of @xmath0 identical two level atoms with a single radiation field mode ,",
    "established the importance of collective effects of atom - field interaction , where the intensity of the spontaneously emitted light is proportional to @xmath1 rather than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the spatial dimensions of the ensemble of atoms are smaller than the wavelength of the radiation field . as a result , all the atoms experience the same field and this gives rise to the collective and cooperative interaction between light and matter .",
    "the dm exhibits a second - order quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from a non - superradiant normal phase to a superradiant phase when the atom - field coupling constant exceeds a certain critical value @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of the qpt predicted in the dm required that the collective atom - photon coupling strength to be of the same order of magnitude as the energy separation between the two atomic levels . in conventional atom - cavity setup",
    "this condition was impossible to satisfy until it was observed recently in a trapped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an optical cavity @xcite . in the bec setup ,",
    "the two spin states of the original dm are the two momentum states of the bec which are controlled by the atomic recoil energy and raman pumping schemes .",
    "this approach is similar to a novel scheme proposed by dimer et .",
    "an important aspect of these experimental developments is the possibility to explore exotic phases mediated by the cavity field .",
    "the superradiance phase transition in a bec is accompanied by self - organization of the atoms into a checker board pattern @xcite .",
    "interesting equilibrium and non - equilibrium phases have been predicted in the dm with bec @xcite , including crystallization and frustration @xcite , as well as spin glass phase @xcite .",
    "multimode dm has also been explored recently , revealing interesting physics such as abelian and non - abelian gauge potentials @xcite , spin - orbit induced anomalous hall effect @xcite , and prediction of the nambu - goldstone mode @xcite .",
    "an interesting extension of the bec dicke model is the optomechanical dicke model which has been proposed for detection of weak forces @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the non - equilibrium properties of the two - atom dicke model , which can be realized by two species bec in an optical cavity . apart from the usual non - equilibrium normal and inverted phases , the dynamical phase diagram reveals a new kind of non - equilibrium mixed phase .",
    "this gives rise to a new quantum phase transition from the mixed phase to the superradiant phase by manipulation of the two distinct atom - photon coupling strengths .",
    "in addition , we show that a quantum phase transition from the non - superradiant phase to the superradiant phase is not allowed for certain values of the atom - photon coupling strengths of the two set of atoms .",
    "[ fig1 ]    we consider two different ensembles of @xmath2 and @xmath3 atoms coupled simultaneously to the quantized field of an optical cavity mode ( fig.1 ) .",

    "the cavity is pumped by an transverse external laser with frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the light - matter coupling strengths for the two sets of atoms are @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these coupling strengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is the single atom - cavity mode coupling while @xmath13 is the transverse pump beam rabi frequency .",
    "the detuning @xmath14 is considered to be large so as to avoid spontaneous emission .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the system takes the form of a two - atom dicke model with    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the effective collective spin of length @xmath17 for the two sets of atom and @xmath18 .",
    "we now discuss the non - equilibrium dynamics arising from the above two - atom dicke model.the semi - classical equations of motion for the system are given by    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    here @xmath24 is the decay rate of the cavity photons . in addition",
    "the magnitude of pseudo - angular momentum is conserved ,    @xmath25    @xmath26    the long time steady state solutions from the equations of motion can be studied with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "this implies that by keeping one coupling strength arbitrarily low , one could enter the superradiant phase by manipulating the second coupling strength alone .",
    "this point would be more clear when we discuss the dynamical phase diagrams in the next section .",

    "these instabilities describe the boundaries in the emerging dynamical phase diagrams .",
    "in particular , the various boundaries between exponentially growing and decaying fluctuations are given as :    normal phase :    @xmath98    inverted phase :    @xmath99    mixed phase 1 :    @xmath100    mixed phase 2 :    @xmath101    note that the `` inverted phase '' is the inversion of the `` normal phase '' around @xmath102 boundary while `` mixed phase @xmath103 '' is the mirror inversion of `` mixed phase @xmath86 '' .",

    "a new kind of dynamical phase diagram emerges for the mixed phase .",

    "@xmath61 root is shown and on moving along the @xmath112 axis ( increasing @xmath8 ) , we encounter the usual superradiant phase with increasing energy . on the other hand ,",
    "moving along the @xmath109 axis ( increasing @xmath9 ) , we get a superradiant phase of constant low energy .",
    "there are regions in the phase diagram , where even when @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the system stays in the non  superradiant phase .",
    "interestingly for @xmath116 , the superradiant phase can never be reached .",
    "infact the energy landscape in the @xmath56 plane gives an impression of anti - crossing of energy levels .",
    "fig.3(b ) shows the plot of @xmath62 root whose behavior is opposite to that of the @xmath61 root . a superradiant phase with decreasing energy is encountered along the @xmath109 axis while a constant high energy phase is encountered along the @xmath112 axis .",
    "note that if we choose @xmath117 , then the energy plots of fig.2 and fig.3 becomes asymmetric ( figure not shown ) .",
    "the current predictions can be tested in an experiment similar to that of ref.@xcite but with two species condensate .",
    "in addition one has to look into the long duration of these experiments beyond the @xmath118 @xmath119 time scale as noted in ref.@xcite",
    "in summary , we have investigated the non - equilibrium quantum phases of a two - atom dicke model , which is realized in a collection two set of cold atoms coupling simultaneously to a single quantized cavity mode . within the framework of the non - equilibrium two - atom dicke model",

    "we have shown the existence of a new kind of quantum phase transition from the non - superradiant mixed phase ( where one set of atoms are in the normal phase while the other set is in the inverted phase ) to the superradiant phase .",
    "in addition , we have demonstrated that in the quantum phase diagram of the mixed phase , there are regions where the superradiant phase can not exist even if the light - matter coupling constants of both set of atoms are above the critical value .",
    "these predictions can be realized in a two species cold atoms in an optical cavity .",
