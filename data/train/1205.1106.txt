    "( the fact that every algebraic lattice is the congruence lattice of an algebra was proved by grtzer and schmidt in  @xcite . )",
    "an important and long - standing open problem in universal algebra is to characterize those lattices that are isomorphic to congruence lattices of _ finite _ algebras .",
    "we call such lattices _ finitely representable_. until this problem is resolved , our understanding of finite algebras is incomplete , since , given an arbitrary finite algebra , we can not say whether there are any restrictions on the shape of its congruence lattice . if we find a finite lattice which does not occur as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra ( as many suspect we will ) , then we can finally declare that such restrictions do exist .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the description and analysis of a new procedure for generating finite lattices which are , by construction , finitely representable . roughly speaking , we start with an arbitrary finite algebra @xmath14 , with known congruence lattice @xmath15 , and we let @xmath16 be sets that either intersect @xmath17 or intersect each other at certain points .",

    "the shape of this lattice is , of course , determined by the shape of @xmath15 , the choice of intersection points of the @xmath25 , and the unary operations chosen for inclusion in @xmath5 . in this paper , we describe two constructions of this type and prove some results about the shape of the congruence lattices of the resulting overalgebras .",
    "however , it is likely that we have barely scratched the surface of useful constructions that are possible with this approach .    before giving an overview of the paper ,",
    "we describe the seminal example that provided the impetus for this work . in the spring of 2011 , while our research seminar was mainly focused on the finite congruence lattice representation problem , we were visited by peter jipsen who initiated the ambitious project of cataloging every small finite lattice @xmath11 for which there is a known finite algebra @xmath26 with @xmath27 . before long we had identified such finite representations for all lattices of order seven or less , except for the two lattices appearing in figure  [ fig : sevens ] .",
