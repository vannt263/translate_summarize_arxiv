    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) in charged lepton decays is forbidden in the standard model and remains highly suppressed even if neutrino mixing is included .",
    "however , lfv is expected in various extensions of the standard model , such as supersymmetry , leptoquark and many other models , e.g. , various mssm scenarios consider @xmath6 lepton decays into semileptonic final states  @xcite .",
    "if lfv occurs via a higgs mediated lfv mechanism , @xmath6 leptons can decay into @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is either an electron or a muon , through a scalar higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "the decays @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are mediated by a pseudoscalar higgs boson while @xmath12 can be mediated through both scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "searches for @xmath13 have not yet been reported while there are already upper limits on the branching fractions for @xmath14 and @xmath15 at the @xmath16 level  @xcite . with certain combinations of new physics parameters",
    "the branching fractions for @xmath13 decays can be as high as @xmath17 , which is already accessible in high - statistics @xmath18-factory experiments .    here",
    "we report our search for @xmath19 with a data sample of 671 fb@xmath2 collected at the @xmath20 resonance and 60 mev below it with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath3 collider  @xcite .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals , all located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath21 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) . the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we use particle identification likelihood variables based on the ratio of the energy deposited in the ecl to the momentum measured in the svd and cdc , the shower shape in the ecl , the particle range in the klm , the hit information from the acc , the @xmath22 information in the cdc , and the particle time - of - flight from the tof . to distinguish hadron species , we use likelihood ratios , for instance , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the likelihood for the detector response to the track with flavor hypothesis @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . for lepton identification , we form likelihood ratios @xmath28  @xcite and @xmath29  @xcite based on the electron and muon probabilities , respectively , which are determined by the responses of the appropriate subdetectors .    in order to estimate the signal efficiency and to optimize the event selection , we use monte carlo ( mc ) samples . the signal and the background events from generic @xmath30 decays",
    "are generated by kkmc / tauola  @xcite . in the signal mc",
    ", we generate @xmath30 , where a @xmath0 decays into a lepton and an @xmath1 meson according to two - body phase space , and the other @xmath0 decays generically . in the signal",
    "mc the @xmath1 meson decays into @xmath31 with mass and width parameters of the @xmath1 based on the result of our study of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "other backgrounds , including @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , bhabha and two - photon processes are generated by evtgen  @xcite , bhlumi  @xcite , and aafh  @xcite , respectively .",
    "all kinematic variables are calculated in the laboratory frame unless otherwise specified .",
    "in particular , variables calculated in the @xmath3 center - of - mass ( cm ) system are indicated by the superscript `` cm '' .",
    "we search for @xmath30 events in which one @xmath0 ( the signal @xmath0 ) decays into a charged lepton and two charged pions from an @xmath1 meson decay and the other @xmath0  ( the tag @xmath0 ) decays into a final state with one charged track and any number of additional photons and neutrinos .",
    "candidate @xmath0-pair events are required to have four tracks with zero net charge .",
    "we reconstruct four charged tracks and any number of photons within the fiducial volume defined by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the polar angle relative to the direction opposite to that of the incident @xmath38 beam in the laboratory frame . the transverse momentum ( @xmath39 ) of each charged track and the energy of each photon ( @xmath40 )",
    "are required to satisfy @xmath41 0.1 gev/@xmath42 and @xmath43 gev , respectively .",
    "for each charged track , the distance of the closest point with respect to the interaction point is required to be less than 0.5 cm in the transverse direction and less than 3.0 cm in the longitudinal direction .",
    "using the plane perpendicular to the cm thrust axis  @xcite , which is calculated from the observed tracks and photon candidates , we separate the particles in an event into two hemispheres .",
    "these are referred to as the signal and tag sides .",
    "the tag side contains one charged track while the signal side contains three charged tracks .",
    "we require the charged track on the signal side to be identified as a lepton .",
    "the lepton identification criteria are @xmath44 and momentum greater than 0.8 gev/@xmath42 .",
    "the electron ( muon ) identification efficiency is 92% ( 86% ) while the probability to misidentify a pion as an electron ( a muon ) is below 0.2% ( 2% ) . in order to take into account the emission of bremsstrahlung photons from electrons , the momenta of photons within 0.05 rad of the electron tracks",
    "are added to the momentum of the electron candidate track . to reduce generic @xmath30 and @xmath45 background events , we veto events with a photon in the signal side .    to ensure that the missing particles are neutrinos rather than photons or charged particles that pass outside the detector acceptance ,",
    "we impose requirements on the missing momentum @xmath46 , which is calculated by subtracting the vector sum of the momenta of all tracks and photons from the sum of the @xmath38 and @xmath47 beam momenta .",
    "we require that the magnitude of @xmath46 be greater than 0.8 gev/@xmath42 , and that its direction point into the fiducial volume of the detector .",
    "furthermore , we reject the event if the direction of the missing momentum traverses the gap between the barrel and the ecl endcap since an undetected photon may fake a neutrino candidate(s ) .",
    "the @xmath1 meson is reconstructed from two oppositely - charged tracks assuming a pion mass for both tracks in the signal side .",
    "the charged pion from the @xmath1 decay is identified by a condition @xmath48 for two tracks except a lepton candidate in the signal side .",
    "figure  [ fig : f0mass ] shows the invariant mass of @xmath31 in the signal side .",
    "we require that the invariant mass satisfy the condition 906 mev/@xmath49 1065 mev/@xmath50 . in order to avoid fake @xmath1 candidates from photon conversions ( i.e. @xmath51 )",
    ", we require that two pion candidates have @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , we require that @xmath53 to suppress two - photon @xmath54 background events .",
    "we require that the cosine of the opening angle between the lepton and the reconstructed @xmath1 candidate in the cm system ( @xmath55 ) be @xmath56 .    to reject @xmath45 background , we require that the magnitude of thrust ( @xmath57 ) be in the range 0.90 @xmath58 0.97 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cut_fig ] ( a ) ) .",
    "we also require @xmath59 gev @xmath60 10.00 gev , where @xmath61 is the total visible energy in the cm system , defined as the sum of the energies of the lepton , @xmath1 candidate , the charged track in the tag side ( with a pion mass hypothesis ) and all photon candidates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cut_fig ] ( b ) ) .    to suppress the @xmath33 and @xmath45 background",
    ", it is required that the number of photons in the tag side @xmath62 be @xmath63 if the charged track is the tag side is an electron or a muon ( a leptonic tag ) and @xmath64 if the track in the tag side is a hadron ( a hadronic tag ) .",
    "since neutrinos are emitted only in the tag side , the direction of @xmath46 should be on the tag side of the event .",
    "the cosine of the opening angle between @xmath46 and the charged track in the tag side in the cm system , @xmath65 ,    should be in the range @xmath66 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cut_fig ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the reconstructed mass of a charged track ( with a pion mass hypothesis ) and photons in the tag side @xmath67 , is required to be less than 1.00 gev/@xmath50 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cut_fig ] ( d ) ) .",
    "for all kinematic distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut_fig ] , reasonable agreement between the data and background mc is observed .",
    "finally , to suppress backgrounds from generic @xmath30 and @xmath45 events , we apply a selection based on the magnitude of the missing momentum @xmath68 and the missing mass squared @xmath69 .",
    "we apply different selection criteria since the number of emitted neutrinos is two for the leptonic tag while it is one for the hadronic tag .",
    "we require the following relation between @xmath70 and @xmath69 : @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the hadronic tag and @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the leptonic tag , where @xmath70 is in gev/@xmath42 and @xmath75 is in gev/@xmath50 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pmiss_vs_mmiss2 ] ) . while this cut retains 56% of the signal , 97% of the generic @xmath30 and 96% of @xmath45 backgrounds are removed .",
    "the signal candidates are examined in the two - dimensional plot of the @xmath7 invariant mass  ( @xmath76 ) versus the difference of their energy from the beam energy in the cm system  ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "a signal event should have @xmath78 close to the @xmath0-lepton mass ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath77 close to zero .",
    "for all modes , the @xmath80 and @xmath77 resolutions are parameterized from fits to the signal mc distributions , with an asymmetric gaussian function that takes into account initial - state radiation .",
    "these gaussians have widths @xmath81 mev/@xmath42@xmath82 and @xmath83 mev for the @xmath84 mode , and @xmath85 mev/@xmath42@xmath82 and @xmath86 mev for the @xmath87 mode ,    where the `` high / low '' superscript indicates the higher / lower side of the peak .",
    "to evaluate the branching fractions , we use elliptical signal regions that contain 90% of the mc signal events satisfying all selection criteria .",
    "we blind the data in the signal region until all selection criteria are finalized so as not to bias our choice of selection criteria .",
    "figure  [ fig : open ] shows scatter - plots for the data and the signal mc distributed over @xmath88 in the @xmath89 plane . for the @xmath90 mode ,",
    "the dominant background comes from two - photon processes in the @xmath91 0 gev region , while @xmath45 and generic @xmath30 events are negligible due to the low electron fake rate . for the @xmath92 mode ,",
    "the dominant sources of background are random combinations of three pions from @xmath45 or generic @xmath30 processes in which one pion is misidentified as a muon .",
    "the @xmath45 events are distributed in the @xmath91 0 gev region while @xmath30 events are distributed in the @xmath93 0 gev and @xmath94 @xmath79 region .",
    "we estimate the expected number of background events in the signal region using the mc distribution with looser selection criteria and extrapolation from the data in the sideband region defined as the @xmath95 region without the signal ellipse .",
    "the signal efficiency and the number of expected background events for each mode are summarized in table  [ tbl : eff ] . after estimating the background , we open the blinded regions and find no candidate events in either mode .    the dominant systematic uncertainties for this analysis come from @xmath1 selection and tracking efficiencies .",
    "the systematic uncertainty for @xmath1 selection is studied by changing mass and width of the @xmath1 using uncertainties from the result of our study  @xcite , and is 9.9% and 9.2% for @xmath90 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty due to the charged track reconstruction is estimated to be 1.0% per charged track , therefore , the total uncertainty due to the charged track finding is 4.0% for both modes .",

    "the uncertainty due to the trigger efficiency is negligible compared with the other uncertainties .",
    "all these uncertainties are added in quadrature , and the total systematic uncertainties for the @xmath96 and @xmath97 mode are 11.5% and 10.8% , respectively .    .",
