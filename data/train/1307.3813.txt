    ", three defect states are induced inside the band gap . since the @xmath1 has trigonal symmetry [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] , the defect states are classified as a singlet @xmath10 state and doubly degenerate @xmath11 states .",
    "due to the absence of an anion ( @xmath1 ) in mos@xmath0 , two excess electrons occupy the @xmath10 state , and the two @xmath11 states are empty in the neutral charge state . the @xmath10 level is found to be located near the vbm , and thus it is not easy to generate carrier electrons from the @xmath12 .",

    "<S> , we investigate the stabilities and the electrical dopabilities of the native defects of s - vacancy ( @xmath1 ) , s - interstitial ( s@xmath2 ) , mo - vacancy ( @xmath8 ) , and mo - interstitial ( mo@xmath2 ) ; the mo substitutional impurities of the group - vb ( v , nb , ta ) and the group - viib ( mn , tc , re ) elements ; and the s substitutional impurities of the group - va ( n , p , as , sb ) and the group - viia ( f , cl , br , i ) elements in single - layer mos@xmath0 , through density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations . for the native defects , the @xmath1 and s@xmath2 are found to be low in formation energy , about @xmath31 ev , in mo- and s - rich conditions , respectively , while the mo - related defects of the @xmath8 and mo@xmath2 have very high formation energies of above 2.5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the carrier doping ability of the @xmath1 and s@xmath2 is however found to be poor , as both the @xmath1 and s@xmath2 are deep level defects . </S>",
    "<S> the group - vb impurities of v , nb , and ta , and the group - viib re impurity as mo substitutional defects are found to be negative in formation energy in s - rich conditions , by which their incorporation in single - layer mos@xmath0 is facile . </S>",
    "<S> the v , nb , and ta are found to be shallow acceptors , and the re is the only shallow donor impurity among the considered defects . </S>",
    "<S> since re is well known to exist in naturally grown mos@xmath0 ( molybdenite ) via geochemical reactions since @xmath32.91 gigayears ago ( ga ) in the oxygenized earth subsurfaces @xcite , the unintentional @xmath4-type doping in single - layer mos@xmath0 exfoliated from it is suggested to originate from the re impurity . </S>"
