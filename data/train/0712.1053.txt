    "one of the most prominent experimental discoveries made at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has been the suppression of highly energetic particles @xcite , which suggests that the matter created at rhic is a color - opaque , high density medium of colored particles where fast partons quickly lose energy by gluon emission @xcite .",
    "measurements of anisotropies in soft particle momentum distributions @xcite have further indicated that soft degrees of freedom are approximately thermalized .",
    "the degree of thermalization has been found to be considerably above the predictions obtained within perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite and , in fact , it seems to be compatible with the `` perfect fluid '' scenario where the strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) has almost zero viscosity @xcite .",
    "this indicates that perturbative methods may fail at describing the microscopic properties of the matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "an alternative approach for understanding jet suppression in the sqgp relies on analyzing the similar problem of a heavy quark moving through an @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym ) plasma .",
    "there the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite provides a way to compute observables at strong coupling on the cft side , such as the stress tensor of the @xmath0 sym plasma , starting from gravitational calculations in five - dimensional @xmath4 space .",
    "it is important to remark that one has to be careful when comparing qcd and @xmath0 sym given that both the symmetries and the microscopic degrees of freedom are very different .",
    "the hope is that some of the differences become unimportant in the strongly coupled limit where the system is to a good approximation a locally thermalized liquid .",
    "a notable result obtained using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite was that the ratio between the viscosity @xmath5 and entropy density @xmath6 of an @xmath0 sym plasma in the limit of large number of colors @xmath7 and large t hooft coupling @xmath8 converges to a `` universal limit '' @xmath9 which has been conjectured @xcite to be the lowest value for this ratio obtainable in a physical system .",
    "remarkably , hydrodynamic models find that the viscosity of the system created at rhic is compatible , or even lower , than this limit @xcite .",
    "the apparent local thermalization at rhic suggests the possibility that the energy lost in jets will itself become locally thermalized , i.e. , encoded in the local hydrodynamic flow . in the immediate vicinity of the jet",
    "the variation of the thermodynamic quantities is probably very large , which means that a hydrodynamic description of the system is bound to fail in this region .",
    "the typical length scale associated with this region is , for instance , given by the sound attenuation length @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the enthalpy of the medium ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for distances scales larger than @xmath12 , one expects that the system can be described in terms of non - linear viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "sufficiently far from the jet , however , the flow velocity and the gradients of the thermodynamic quantities are so small that linearized hydrodynamic equations should provide an accurate description of the system s dynamics . in the linearized limit , for certain energy deposition patterns ,",
    "this gives rise to mach cones , which can be readily connected to the fluid s equation of state @xcite . in the absence of these conditions ,",
    "the flow pattern is likely to be considerably more complex but will nevertheless result in a correlation between the flow and the jet .",
    "the possibility of detecting these effects in heavy ion collisions has recently been subject to intense theoretical and experimental interest @xcite .",
    "the degree of thermalization of the energy of the suppressed jets is a fundamental probe of the microscopic properties of the matter created at rhic . because of the apparent strong coupling of the system , non - perturbative methods such as ads / cft seem to be necessary .",
    "recently , this method has been used to obtain the energy - momentum tensor of an infinitely heavy quark moving at constant velocity through a strongly coupled plasma @xcite .",
    "the results have been analyzed in the far field limit @xcite in terms of linearized navier - stokes hydrodynamics and , encouragingly , it has been shown that structures resembling mach cones and diffusion wakes , with an angle comparable to that expected from the equation of state , do form in the far - field limit .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was shown that linearized navier - stokes hydrodynamics provides a very accurate description of the system at distances @xmath13 ( in the limit of the large @xmath14 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , close to the quark linearized hydrodynamics , and eventually the hydrodynamic description , should fail to account for the energy - momentum tensor of the system .",
    "distinguishing between non - linear , turbulent hydrodynamics , and the failure of hydrodynamics is impossible within the linearized regime . in this work we focus on the region very close to the quark and perform an analysis of the _ near quark _ energy - momentum tensor computed in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) using viscous , non - linear ( first - order ) navier - stokes hydrodynamics .",
    "we construct the flow vector by boosting the energy - momentum tensor in @xcite to the local rest frame of the flow .",
    "this flow vector is used to construct the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to a viscous fluid having an equation of state and transport coefficients identical to those of strongly coupled @xmath0 sym matter with the same flow vector .",
    "we then quantitatively examine the discrepancies between the two tensors and plot them as a function of the distance from the heavy quark .    throughout this paper",
    "the units are @xmath15 and 4-vectors are denoted by capital letters , e.g. , @xmath16 .",
    "also , the minkowski metric @xmath17 is used .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of a heavy quark passing through an @xmath0 sym plasma at finite temperature @xmath18 can be computed by considering metric fluctuations due to a string that is hanging down from the boundary of an ads schwarzschild ( ads - ss ) background geometry @xcite . , where m is the quark s mass @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider only this classical limit . assuming that @xmath19 gev and @xmath20",
    ", one sees that the classical string dynamics is a much better approximation for bottom quarks than for charm quarks .",
    "] in fact , in this limit the total action that describes the supergravity approximation to type iib string theory in an ads - ss background and the classical string is given by the sum of the following partial actions @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radius of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the total metric , and @xmath28 is the metric of the unperturbed ads - ss black hole ( without effects from the string ) , which can be obtained from @xmath29 where @xmath30 goes from @xmath31 at the ads boundary to @xmath32 at the black hole horizon ( @xmath18 is the hawking temperature associated with the black hole ) and @xmath33 .",
    "the string coordinates @xmath34 in the nambu - goto action in eq .",
    "( [ nambugoto ] ) are chosen in such a way that the string endpoint ( which corresponds to the heavy quark in the 4-dimensional boundary ) moves at constant speed @xmath35 and no energy flows from the horizon into the string @xcite .    minimizing the action @xmath36 with respect to @xmath37 leads to the full set of einstein s equations .",
    "it is sufficient for our purposes here to consider instead the linearized einstein s equations for the metric fluctuations @xmath38 , which are defined via @xmath39 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the contribution from the moving quark to the total energy - momentum tensor is @xmath40 , where the tensor @xmath41 is obtained by expanding @xmath42 in powers of @xmath30 near the boundary , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "the total energy - momentum tensor in the lab frame that describes the near - quark dynamics of the plasma was computed by yarom @xcite and it reads @xmath44 where the explicit form of @xmath45 is @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the equations above we used the dimensionless cylindrical coordinates @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the comoving coordinate of the quark ) , @xmath56 , and also defined @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , @xmath58 is the pressure of the ideal sym plasma @xcite .",
    "note that the disturbances in the medium caused by the string are parametrically of @xmath59 in the near - quark region @xcite , while the vacuum coulomb stress ( not included here ) is @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "it is assumed throughout the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ energymomentumtensor1 ] ) that the metric disturbances caused by the moving string are small in comparison to the @xmath61 background metric .",
    "therefore , this result is correct as long as this condition is fulfilled .",
    "in fact , since @xmath45 scales inversely with the total distance from the quark , the region where the condition @xmath62 ( or , equivalently , @xmath42 small in comparison to @xmath63 ) holds can be taken to be arbitrarily small as long as the limit where @xmath64 and @xmath8 is large is employed .",
    "however , in order to evaluate the relevance of this approach to heavy ion collisions , one may choose @xmath65 , @xmath20 ( @xmath66 ) , and @xmath67 . using these parameters",
    ", one obtains that the magnitude of the energy density disturbances caused by the string along the jet axis , @xmath68 , is @xmath69 when @xmath70 ( which is comparable to uncertainty principle bound on the mean free path discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "we shall now compare the tensor in eq .",
    "[ energymomentumtensor1 ] to the one that represents a solution to the relativistic navier - stokes equations with an arbitrary flow .",
    "we underline that the _ quantitative _ values for the flow and thermodynamic quantities resulting from our analysis should be taken with caution .",
    "in fact , one would expect that the validity of a low - energy hydrodynamic description of the near - field region worsens as one becomes closer to the heavy quark . however , this analysis is necessary to ascertain the domain of validity of ( general ) hydrodynamics , as opposed to non - equilibrium field configurations ( up to the `` opposite extreme '' of fully anisotropic classical solutions to the field equations ) .",
    "as we show in this paper and subsequent work @xcite , ascertaining this domain of validity of hydrodynamics is crucial for the development of the phenomenological properties of ads / cft based models .    in hydrodynamics , the knudsen number @xmath71 is defined as the ratio between the mean free path @xmath72 and a characteristic spatial dimension of the system @xmath73 .",
    "hydrodynamics is applicable when @xmath74 . in conformal field theories at finite temperature , the only dimensionful parameter is given by the temperature @xmath18 and , thus , both @xmath72 and @xmath73 should be proportional to @xmath75 . however , the mean free path is not a well defined quantity in @xmath0 sym theories at very strong coupling .",

    "<S> the near zone energy - momentum tensor of a supersonic heavy quark jet moving through a strongly - coupled @xmath0 sym plasma is analyzed in terms of first - order navier - stokes hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the hydrodynamical description of the near quark region worsens with increasing quark velocities . </S>",
    "<S> for realistic quark velocities , @xmath1 , the non - hydrodynamical region is located at a narrow band surrounding the quark with a width of approximately @xmath2 in the direction parallel to the quark s motion and with a length of roughly @xmath3 in the perpendicular direction . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be interpreted as an indication of the presence of coherent yang - mills fields where deviation from hydrodynamics is at its maximum . in the region where hydrodynamics does provide a good description of the system s dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , the flow velocity is so small that all the nonlinear terms can be dropped . </S>",
    "<S> our results , which are compatible with the thermalization timescales extracted from elliptic flow measurements , suggest that if ads / cft provides a good description of the rhic system , the bulk of the quenched jet energy has more than enough time to locally thermalize and become encoded in the collective flow . the resulting flow pattern close to the quark , however , is shown to be considerably different than the superposition of mach cones and diffusion wakes observed at large distances . </S>"
