    "in the present day world , many financial institutions face the risk of unexpected fluctuations in human mortality and clearly , this risk has two aspects .",
    "on one side , life insurers paying death benefits will suffer an economic loss if actual rates of mortality are in excess of those expected , due to catastrophic events such as a severe outbreak of an epidemic or a major man - made or natural disaster .",
    "this side of the risk is known in the literature by the name of _ mortality risk_. on the other hand , pension plan sponsors , as well as insurance companies providing retirement annuities , are subject to _ longevity risk _ , that is , the risk that people outlive their expected lifetimes . for these institutions ,",
    "the longer the life - span of people , the greater the period of time over which retirement income must be paid and , hence , the larger the financial liability .",
    "an unanticipated change in mortality rates will affect all policies in force .",
    "therefore , as opposed to the random variations between lifetimes of individuals , it can not be diversified away by increasing the size of the portfolio .",
    "reinsurance is one possible solution to the problem , but its capacity is usually limited . alternatively , the risk may be naturally hedged or reduced through balancing products . for example , an insurance company may sell life insurance to the same customers who are buying life annuities .",
    "the resulting combination would then reduce the company s exposure to future changes in mortality , consequently permitting a reduction of capital reserves held in respect of mortality or longevity risk .",
    "this idea of compensating longevity risk by mortality risk is often referred to as _ natural hedging_. however , this strategy , as @xcite pointed out , may be cost prohibitive and may not be practical in some circumstances .",
    "as a result , a natural remedy to tackle these risks has emerged in the form of what is known as mortality securitization which manifests itself in the form of _ mortality - linked securities _ abbreviated in the literature as _ mlss_. these securities provide a tool in the hands of insurers to transfer their mortality - sensitive exposures to a vested number of investors in the capital market , offering them a reasonable risk premium in return .",
    "mortality - linked securities differ from their longevity counterparts in the sense that while the former have their cash flows linked to a mortality index , the latter are based upon survivor index . for a more detailed review of the two type of bonds",
    ", one can refer to @xcite .",
    "in fact mortality - linked securities are also known as _ extreme mortality bonds _ or _ embs _ or _ catastrophe ( cat ) mortality bonds _ or _",
    "catm bonds _ since they are triggered by a catastrophic evolution of death rates of one or more populations .",
    "these bonds are extremely lucrative to the investors because of their potential of providing diversification to the portfolio .",
    "the generous return on these bonds generally does not bear any correlation with the return on other investments , such as fixed income or equities .",
    "from the point of view of the reinsurer these instruments act as ` alternative risk transfer ' ( art ) mechanisms .",
    "the pioneering mls was the swiss re mortality bond ( vita i ) issued in 2003 which is the prime focus of this paper .",
    "this was followed up by the eib / bnp longevity bond issued in 2004 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the former ,",
    "the principal of the bond would have been reduced if there had been a catastrophic mortality event during the life of the bond , therefore allowing swiss re to reduce some of its exposure to extreme mortality risk . on the contrary ,",
    "the latter was a 25-year longevity bond , which was intended for uk pension funds with exposures to longevity risk .",
    "this bond took the form of an annuity bond with annual coupon payments tied to the realized survival rates for some english and welsh males .",
    "however , it did not get the same reception as the swiss re bond .",
    "swiss re followed up the success of vita i by launching five more series of vita bonds with the latest one being vita vi which will cover extreme mortality events in australia , canada and the uk over a 5 year term from january 2016 .",
    "apart from this swiss re also experimented with a multi - peril bond called  mythen re \" which synthesized catastrophe and mortality risks , obtaining 200 million us dollars in protection for north atlantic hurricane and uk extreme mortality risk .",
    "many other reinsurance giants such as scottish re and munich re have also issued a score of other mortality bonds .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for further details .",
    "in fact it is interesting to note that swiss re has also launched an innovative ` longevity trend bond ' called the swiss re kortis bond in december 2010 .",
    "interested readers can refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a more up to date list of developments connected to mortality and longevity securities and markets can be found in @xcite and @xcite . as an aftereffect of these innovative securities ,",
    "a number of valuation approaches on mls s have germinated .",
    "@xcite classify the approaches into the following four heads :    * _ risk - adjusted process or no - arbitrage pricing : _ under this approach , the first step is to estimate the distribution of future mortality rates in the real - world probability measure .",
    "then the real - world distribution is transformed to its risk - neutral counterpart , on the basis of the actual prices of mortality - linked securities observed in the market .",
    "finally , the price of a mortality - linked security can be calculated by discounting , at the risk - free interest rate , its expected payoff under the identified risk - neutral probability measure .",
    "an important point underlying this approach is that it takes into account the actual prices as given .",
    "the need of market prices makes the implementation of this approach difficult .",
    "one way to effectively use the no arbitrage approach is to use a stochastic mortality model , which is , at the very beginning , defined in the real - world measure and fitted to past data .",
    "the model is then calibrated to market prices , yielding a risk - neutral mortality process from which security prices are calculated .",
    "for instance , @xcite calibrate a two - factor mortality model to the price of the bnp / eib longevity bond .",
    "the wang transform : _ it is the approach given by @xcite , @xcite which consists of employing a distortion operator that transforms the underlying distribution into a risk - adjusted distribution and the mls price is the expected value under the risk - adjusted probability discounted by risk - free rate . the wang transform was first employed for mortality - linked securities by @xcite , and subsequently by other researchers including @xcite and @xcite .",
    "based on the positive dependence characteristic of the mortality in catastrophe areas , @xcite develop a pricing model for catastrophe mortality bonds with comonotonicity and a jump - difusion process .",
    "pointing out there is no unique risk - neutral probability in this incomplete market settings , they use the wang transform method to price the bond .",
    "unless a very simple mortality model is assumed , parameters in the distortion operator are not unique if we are not given sufficient market price data . for example , when @xcite used their extended lee - carter model with transitory jump effects to price a mortality bond , they were required to estimate three parameters in the wang transform . to solve for these three parameters , chen and cox assumed that they were equal , but such an assumption is not easy to justify",
    ". in fact @xcite has questioned the wang transform by stating that it is not a universal financial measure for financial and insurance pricing . for more details",
    "one can refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* _ instantaneous sharpe ratio : _",
    "@xcite propose that the expected return on the mls equals the risk free rate plus the sharp ratio times its standard deviation .    *",
    "_ the utility - based valuation : _ the utility based method defines an investor s utility function and maximizes an agent s expected utility subject to wealth constraints to obtain the mls equilibrium . for an elaborate discussion one can review @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "apart from the aforesaid methods @xcite and @xcite use the extreme value theory to measure mortality risk of the 2003 swiss re bond . for an interesting summary of other methods to price mls s one can refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the methods available in literature for the pricing of mls s offer only a limited application due to restrictions such as availability of price information or specific utility functions .",
    "the difficulty in pricing mls s stems from the fact that the mls market is incomplete as the underlying mortality rates are usually untradeable in financial markets . as a result",
    ", the usual no - arbitrage pricing method can only provide a price range or a price bound , instead of a single value .",
    "surprisingly , mortality linked securities , apart from their present day form seem to have a long history . in the 17th and 18th centuries , so - called _ ` tontines ' _ , which were named after the neapolitan banker lorenzo tonti , had been offered by several governments ( @xcite ) . within these schemes , investors made a one - time payment , and annual dividends were distributed among the survivors . hence , while still relying on the investor s survival , his payoffs were connected to the mortality experience among the pool of subscribers .",
    "these issues were particularly successful in france , but due to high interest payments , they soon became precarious for the crown s financial situation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this was not only the case with tontines ; life annuities , which presented another large share of the royal debt , were also offered at highly favourable conditions from the investors perspective .",
    "this carelessness was exploited by the genevan entrepreneur jacob bouthillier beaumont in the scheme attributed to him ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", annuities were subscribed on the lives of a group of genevan girls for the account of genevan investors .",
    "thus , their payoffs were directly linked to the survival of the genevan  madmoiselles \" , and due to the  generous \" assumptions of the french authorities , the schemes were initially highly profitable for the genevans , the real victim being the french taxpayer .",
    "these speculations came to an abrupt end with the french revolution in 1789 , for which the budgetary crises caused by the careless borrowing was , undoubtedly , one major reason . until the beginning of this century , there has not been another public issue of a mortality linked security , however , there are indications of recent private transactions resembling the tontine scheme ( see @xcite ) . for a more detailed overview of the history of mortality contingent securities the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite and @xcite .    today , all around the world",
    ", investment banks and other financial service providers are working on the idea of trading longevity risk , and the first mortality trading desks have been installed solidifying that ",
    "betting on the time of death is set  .",
    "this paper is concerned with finding price bounds for the swiss re mortality catastrophe bond by expressing its payoff in the form of an asian put option and using the methodology adopted by @xcite to find a price range for asian options .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows : the next section describes the structure of the swiss re bond and expresses its payoff in the form of an asian put option .",
    "section 3 shows derivations of the lower bound for the aforesaid bond using comonotonicity . in section 4",
    ", we use the same to derive upper bounds for the swiss re bond . in section 5",
    ", we illustrate the computation of bounds by choosing specific models for mortality index .",
    "section 6 portrays numerical results for the derived theory and compares the results with monte carlo price of the bond price .",
    "appropriate figures that highlight comparisons among the bounds have also been furnished .",
    "the concluding section presents conclusions and avenues for further research .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the financial capacity of the life insurance industry to pay catastrophic death losses from natural or man - made disasters is limited . to expand its capacity to pay catastrophic mortality losses , swiss",
    "re procured about 400 million in coverage from institutional investors in lieu of its first pure mortality security .",
    "the reinsurance giant issued a three year bond in december 2003 with maturity on january 1 , 2007 . to carry out the transaction ,",
    "swiss re set up a special purpose vehicle ( spv ) called vita capital ltd .",
    "this enabled the corresponding cash flows to be kept off swiss re s balance sheet .",
    "the principal is subject to mortality risk which is defined in terms of an index @xmath0 in year @xmath1 .",
    "this mortality index was constructed as a weighted average of mortality rates ( deaths per 100,000 ) over age , sex ( male 65% and female 35% ) and nationality ( us 70% , uk 15% , france 7.5% , italy 5% and switzerland 2.5% ) and is given below .",

    "the swiss re bond was a principal - at - risk bond .",

    "the pay - off structures , i.e. the design of the issued securities and the mortality contingent payments should be developed to appear attractive to investors and the re - insurer . although , the swiss re bond was fully subscribed and press reports highlight that investors were quite satisfied with it ( e.g. _ euroweek _ , 19 december 2003 ) , the market for mortality linked securities still needs innovations such as vanilla options on mortality index to provide flexible hedging solutions .",
    "investors of the swiss re bond included a large number of pension funds as they could view this bond as a powerful hedging instrument .",

    "although , as our previous discussion indicates , such securities with the underlying as the mortality index have not appeared on the horizon as yet , but would be indispensable for the development of a complete life market .",
    "the first step towards designing of such securities is the need for a benchmark longevity index .",
    "the formation of life and longevity markets association ( llma ) in 2010 was an important milestone in this direction .",

    "<S> in this paper , we are concerned with the valuation of catastrophic mortality bonds and , in particular , we examine the case of the swiss re mortality bond 2003 as a primary example of this class of assets . </S>",
    "<S> this bond was the first catastrophic mortality bond to be launched in the market and encapsulates the behaviour of a well - defined mortality index to generate payoffs for bondholders . </S>",
    "<S> pricing this type of bonds is a challenging task and no closed form solution exists in the literature . in our approach , we adapt the payoff of such a bond in terms of the payoff of an asian put option and present a new approach to derive model - independent bounds exploiting comonotonic theory as illustrated in @xcite for the pricing of asian options . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out monte carlo simulations to estimate the bond price and illustrate the strength of the bounds . </S>"
