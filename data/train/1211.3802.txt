    "we supplement this result with a new phase boundary that has been overlooked in ref .  [ ] .",

    "it is known that a large exchange field will close the bulk band gap induced from potential difference and results in a metallic phase .",
    "most importantly , the band gap closing is not always exactly at the valley points as in other phase transitions we have discussed . after rearranging the hamiltonian , the @xmath205 hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath206,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath207,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath208,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath209.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    due to the particle - hole symmetry , the bulk gap closing must occur at @xmath167 .",

    "@xmath232 could arise .",
