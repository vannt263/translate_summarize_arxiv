    "the idea of quantum pumping , i.e. of producing a dc current at zero bias voltage by time periodic modulation of two system parameters , dates back to the work of thouless @xcite .",
    "if the parameters change slowly as compared to all internal time scales of the system , the pumping is _ adiabatic _ , and the average charge per period does not depend on the detailed time dependence of the parameters .",
    "using the concept of emissivity proposed by bttiker et al.@xcite , brouwer@xcite related the charge pumped in a period to the derivatives of the instantaneous scattering matrix of the conductor with respect to the time - varying parameters . since then , a general framework to compute the pumped charge through a conductor has been developed for noninteracting electrons@xcite .",
    "the interest in the pumping phenomenon has shifted then to the experimental@xcite investigations of confined nanostructures , as quantum dots , where the realization of the periodic time - dependent potential can be achieved by modulating gate voltages applied to the structure@xcite . in case of interacting electrons the computation of the pumped charge",
    "becomes rather involved and few works have addressed this issue for different systems@xcite and in specific regimes . as for the case of interacting quantum dots ,",
    "the pumped charge in a period was calculated by aono@xcite by exploiting the zero - temperature mapping of the kondo problem .",
    "a very general formalism was developed in ref .",
    "[ ] where an adiabatic expansion of the self - energy based on the average - time approximation was used to calculate the dot green s function while a linear response scheme was employed in ref .",
    "more recently , another interesting study@xcite was performed aiming at generalizing brouwer s formula for interacting systems to include inelastic scattering events .    in this work we present a general expression for the adiabatic pumping current in the interacting quantum dot in terms of instantaneous properties of the system at equilibrium , generalizing the scattering approach for noninteracting particles and",
    "discuss the limit of its validity . to get a pumped current",
    "the two model parameters which are varied in time are the tunneling rates between the noninteracting leads and the quantum dot .",
    "in particular , we let them vary both in modulus and phase through the adiabatic and periodic modulation of two external parameters ( e.g. gate voltages or magnetic fields ) and show that a rectification - like term arises in the current due to the time - dependent tunneling phase .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec.[sec : model ] we introduce the model and relevant parameters .",
    "we develop the scattering matrix approach together with the green s function formalism to derive the formula of the pumped current through an interacting multilevel quantum dot in the adiabatic regime at very low - temperatures . in sec.[sec : single - level ] we specialize on a single - level quantum dot and give the explicit expression of the pumped current .",
    "conclusions are given in sec.[sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a multi - level quantum dot ( qd ) coupled to two noninteracting leads , with the external leads being in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath4 in the lead @xmath5 and dispersion @xmath6 .",
    "the qd is described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 , where @xmath8 with @xmath9 the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the electron with spin @xmath10 and @xmath11 the dot @xmath12-th energy level .",
    "the on - site energy @xmath13 describes the coulomb interaction .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian is given by @xmath14 , with time - dependent tunnel matrix elements @xmath15 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that @xmath16 are spin independent , i.e. @xmath17 and that both the modulus and the phase of @xmath18 vary in time with frequency @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "their explicit time dependence is determined by two external parameters ( e.g. two gate voltages applied at the barriers of the dot or a gate voltage and a magnetic field ) which are varied adiabatically and periodically in time or by the presence of parasitic bias voltages .",
    "two specific examples will be considered below . in particular",
    ", we will specialize on the case in which the tunneling phase can vary harmonically or linearly in time .",
    "the instantaneous strength of the coupling to the leads is instead characterized by the parameters @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the density of states in the leads at the fermi level . by varying in time",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 and keeping them out of phase , the charge @xmath25 pumped in a period @xmath26 is related to the time dependent current @xmath27 flowing through the left barrier , i.e. @xmath28 .    while the exact formula for the current depends on time - dependent green s function out of equilibrium , in the following we consider the adiabatic limit where the current depends only on the instantaneous equilibrium properties of the dot , i.e. on the retarded dot green s function ( gf ) .",
    "this situation is realized in the two following cases .",
    "first , let us consider that only the modulus of the tunneling matrix elements is varied in time , i.e. @xmath29 . under the adiabatic condition , the tunneling rate varies slowly in time , and the quantum dot can be considered time by time in equilibrium with the external leads . the effect of quantum pumping is well described by an adiabatic expansion of the self - energy based on the average - time approximation as described in ref . [ ] and using the equilibrium relations to write the pumped current in terms of the retarded gf only .",
    "let us consider now the situation in which the modulus of the tunneling terms is fixed while their phases are modulated in time , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "this situation is equivalent ( by a gauge transformation ) to having a system biased with an ac external signal .",
    "in particular , the ac voltage applied to the leads is proportional to the time derivative of the tunneling phase @xmath31@xcite .",
    "since the tunneling terms are assumed to vary in time with frequency @xmath19 , the ac signal forcing the quantum dot is proportional to the pumping frequency @xmath19 and thus can be considered as a small perturbation under the adiabatic condition .",
    "in particular , if one consider the case in which the tunneling phases vary linearly in time , @xmath32 , this situation corresponds to an interacting quantum dot biased by a dc voltage @xmath33 . following the work by meir and wingreen@xcite , the current @xmath34 flowing through the interacting multilevel dot biased by a dc voltage @xmath33 can be written as : @xmath35tr\\{g^a\\gamma^r g^r \\gamma^l\\mathcal{r}\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are the fermi functions , @xmath37 are the dot - leads coupling strengths and @xmath38 is the ratio between the fully interacting self - energy and the noninteracting one , responsible for the deviation from the landauer - bttiker formula ( see ref .",
    "[ ] , eq.(10 ) ) . in the zero - temperature limit and for a weak bias",
    ", @xmath39 at the fermi level and thus eq . ( [ eq : curr - out - eq ] ) can written as @xmath40 , which corresponds to the usual linear response form , even though the green s function are interacting ones .",
    "this argument is extensively discussed in refs .",
    "[ ] ( see eq.s ( 37 ) and ( 38 ) ) and [ ] .",
    "thus in general we expect that , when both the modulus and the phase of the pumping parameters are varied in time , apart the usual dc pumping current a new term arises ( that we call of _ rectification _ ) which is proportional to the time derivative of the tunneling phase : @xmath41 .",
    "since , as explained above , in adiabatic regime the current is determined by the instantaneous properties of the dot ( retarded green s function ) and since in the zero temperature limit the usual linear response formula can be adopted for the calculation of the current , the pumping and rectification currents through the interacting quantum dot can be calculated by the scattering matrix approach as well .",
    "in fact , as well known , the retarded green s function is related to scattering matrix by the fisher - lee relation .",
    "we thus employ the scattering matrix formalism developed in ref .",
    "[ ] where the charge current originated by an adiabatic pump is related to an expansion of the quantity @xmath42s^{\\dag}(e,\\tau)\\}_{\\alpha\\alpha}$ ] with respect to the time derivative operator @xmath43 ( here @xmath44 is the scattering matrix and @xmath45 is the fermi function ) .",
    "the first order of this expansion reproduces the famous brouwer s formula@xcite .",
    "let us only stress that the scattering matrix formalism is well defined , not only in the noninteracting case , but also for the interacting problem ( e.g. see ref .",
    "the expression of the pumped current @xmath46 in terms of the time - dependent scattering matrix@xcite is : @xmath47 where @xmath45 is the fermi function and @xmath44 is the instantaneous @xmath48-matrix of the qd .",
    "it is given by the wigner transform @xmath49 , where @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the full retarded qd green s function , @xmath52 and @xmath53_{mn}=2\\pi i\\rho v^{\\ast}_{\\alpha , m}(t)v_{\\beta , n}(t')$ ] . in the limit of the pumping frequency @xmath54 , i.e. under the adiabatic condition , the scattering matrix @xmath44 is expressed by the instantaneous green s function of the dot as@xcite : @xmath55    when substituting ( [ eq : inst ] ) into ( [ eq : curr ] ) to compute the current we need the time - derivative of the qd green s function which satisfies the relation : @xmath56 where the dot symbol indicates a time - derivative and the matrix notation for the dot green s function has been used .",
    "the final expression obtained for the @xmath46 for a multi - level quantum dot is@xcite : @xmath57,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 this expression has been obtained by considering explicitly the time dependence of the modulus and phase of the tunnel matrix elements , and consequently of the leads - dot coupling function @xmath59 .",
    "the symbol @xmath60 stands for the l , r lead in correspondence of @xmath61=r , l .",
    "the total dc current through the lead @xmath61 is given by : @xmath62.\\ ] ] the expression ( [ eq : main ] ) represents our main result .",
    "it is valid for a multi - level qd and for any interaction strength in the zero temperature limit under the adiabatic condition . the first term in eq.([eq : main ] ) represents the pumping current , while the second one , proportional to the time - derivative of the tunneling rate phase , is the effective rectification term we have discussed above .",
    "it can also be written as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the conductance of the structure , while @xmath65 . the last term in ( [ eq : main ] )",
    "contains information on the time derivative of the retarded self - energy and is zero for a single - level quantum dot within the wide band limit .",
    "up to now we have developed a theory of the pumped current valid in the case of a multi - level qd .",
    "we now specialize eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) to the case of a single level qd . eliminating the trace in ( [ eq : main ] ) and considering the remaining quantities as c - numbers , the expression for",

    "+ in order to show the effects of the time - dependent tunneling phase we report below the numerical results of the charge @xmath67 pumped per cycle .",
    "the pumping cycle is determined by the periodic time variation of the leads - dot coupling strength , where @xmath80 , while for the tunneling phase two cases can be considered .",
    "either it varies harmonically @xmath81 with the same frequency of the two external gate voltages ( this case is shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) or it varies linearly in time @xmath82 , e.g. when a parasitic gate voltage is present , ( this case is shown in fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath83 is the pumping phase that we take different from zero between l and r lead .",

    "this phase would be a berry phase @xcite .",
    "thus the detection of a rectification current in addition to the pumping one could be an indirect probe of a berry phase .",
