    "the paleomagnetic records of the earth s magnetic field show that the field has changed its polarity many times along geological history ( hundreds of times during the last 160 million years ) . but intervals among such geomagnetic polarity reversals are highly irregular .",
    "thus while their average is about @xmath1 years , there are intervals as long as @xmath2 years without polarity change , but with large deviations of the poles from actual positions .",
    "there are many factors which can affect the earth s magnetic field .",
    "for example the reynolds number of the earth s liquid core is believed to be of the order of @xmath3 , i.e. sufficiently large that the flow of electrical currents in the liquid core be turbulent . hence the pattern of the earth s magnetic field is very complex ( see for ex.@xcite ) . because of such great complexity , to study the reversals of the earth s magnetic field",
    ", relatively simple mechanical dynamos had been proposed as analog models @xcite .",
    "one of them is the rikitake dynamo of two frictionless coupled disks , which is a paradigm of the geomagnetic field behavior , proposed by the japanese geophysicist rikitake @xcite .",
    "this model can be considered only as a special case for the real geodynamo , which is obviously a high order physical system with very large degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the rikitake dynamo is composed of two conducting rotating disks which are connected to two coils so that the current in each coil feeds the magnetic field of the other ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "each circuit has the same self - inductance @xmath4 and electrical resistance @xmath5 , and for each disk dynamo a constant mechanical torque @xmath6 is applied from outside on the axis , so that it can rotate with the angular velocity @xmath7    the currents @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the circuits and the related voltages @xmath10 and @xmath11 are connected by the well known relations for the @xmath12 circuits @xmath13{c}% ri_{1}+l\\frac{di_{1}}{dt}=mi_{1}\\omega_{1},\\\\ ri_{2}+l\\frac{di_{2}}{dt}=mi_{2}\\omega_{2 } , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 and @xmath15are the voltages @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath16 is the mutual inductance .",
    "if @xmath17 is considered the moment of inertia of each disk , these relations can be rescaled and lead finally ( see for ex @xcite ) to the model equations @xmath13{cl}% \\overset{.}{x}_{1}= & x_{2}\\ast x_{3}-ax_{1},\\\\ \\overset{.}{x}_{2}= & ( x_{3}-p)x_{1}-ax_{2},\\\\ \\overset{.}{x}_{3}= & 1-x_{1}x_{2 } , \\end{array } \\label{ivp}%\\ ] ]    with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the control parameter @xmath20 is considered to be positive .",
    "the system is invariant under the change @xmath21 . therefore if @xmath22 is a solution to ( [ ivp ] ) , then @xmath23 is also a solution .",
    "the system is dissipative the divergence being negative @xmath24where the vector function @xmath25 is the right hand side of ( [ ivp ] ) .",
    "the equilibrium points are    @xmath26    and they are not hyperbolic .",
    "the rikitake model is still intensely investigated , not only for its physical interest , but especially for the richness of its dynamical behavior ( see for example @xcite ) . in our numerical research of the dynamics of this system , we have found an interesting transient attractor ( ta ) persisting for a long time interval before the trajectory reaches one attractor .",
    "the trajectory generating this transient passes through the real attractor several times .",
    "ta size is disproportionately high compared to the size of real attractor .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to see that ta is very unstable being related to the @xmath0-axis .",
    "for that reason our paper is focused on two directions : primarily , to present ta with its proper behavior and secondarily to synthesize any rikitake attractor by using the attractor synthesis algorithm ( introduced in @xcite ) , that switches the control parameter of the system for finite time intervals , while the model is numerically integrated .",
    "therefore , this algorithm firstly applied to systems with hyperbolic equilibria , is extended here to another class of systems .",
    "one of the main algorithm benefits is the fact that it allows the generation of any attractors , because of the convexity property presented in section 2 , even if for some objective reasons , some parameter values are not accessible .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : section 2 describes the synthesis algorithm while in section 3 the ta is presented beside the application of the synthesis algorithm .",
    "the conclusion summarizes the results of this work .",
    "let us consider the following initial value problem ( ivp ) @xmath27    where @xmath28 is a nonlinear vector function , @xmath29and @xmath30 is a piece - wise continuous periodic function with period @xmath31and mean value @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33    and @xmath34 is a real @xmath35 squared matrix .",
    "next , we make the following assumption    * h1 * the ivp ( [ eq1 ] ) admits unique solutions .    in @xcite it is proved that the solutions of the ivp ( [ eq1 ] ) for the case of continuous systems with respect to the state variable , and of the corresponding _ averaged model _",
    ", expressed as follows@xmath36    may have arbitrarily close solutions .",
    "this means that switching @xmath20 in the ivp ( [ eq1 ] ) following some periodic scheme within a selected set of values , while the ivp is numerically integrated , the solutions remain close enough to the solutions of the ivp ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the analysis is carried out based on the averaging theory @xcite .",
    "the class of systems modeled by ( [ eq1 ] ) includes known dynamical systems such as : lorenz , rssler , chen , lotka - volterra , l , minimal networks , neuronal networks , a class of lasers , etc .",
    "moreover , by using several computational tests , we verified that the switching algorithm applies not only to continuous dynamical systems , but also to fractional - order systems .    while in the mentioned examples we have studied systems with hyperbolic equilibrium points , in this paper we prove numerically and computationally , that the algorithm can be applied to the rikitake s system which has non - hyperbolic equilibria .",
    "despite the fact that could be some differences between computation and theory , the numerical integration of ( [ eq1 ] ) can generally give excellent approximations to the trajectories within the invariant sets .",
    "the trajectories that start near an attractor will stay near and they will be shadowed by orbits within the attractor because attractors arise as the limiting behavior of trajectories .",
    "therefore , the shadowing property @xcite enables us to recover long time approximation properties of numerical trajectories necessary in our numerical computations .    roughly speaking , a _",
    "global attractor _ can be viewed as a region of a dynamical system s state space where some of the system trajectories can enter and not leave , and which contains no smaller such region @xcite .",
    "a global attractor contains all the dynamics evolving from all possible initial conditions . in other words",
    ", it contains all the solutions , including the stationary and periodic ones , as well as chaotic attractors , relevant to the asymptotic behaviors of the system .    the term _ local attractor _ is sometimes used to denominate non - global attractors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the global attractors may contain several local attractors .",
    "therefore , a global attractor may be considered to be composed of a set of all local attractors .",
    "each of them only attract trajectories from a subset of initial conditions , specified by its basin of attraction .",
    "[ rem cu attr]for the sake of simplicity , but without loss of generality , in this paper when a global attractor is composed by several local attractors , only one of the single local attractors will be considered .",
    "the attractors are numerically approximated using some scheme for odes with fixed step size @xmath37 after the transients are neglected ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown via numerical approach and computer simulations , that while the model ( [ eq1 ] ) is numerically integrated , if one switch the control parameter at finite time intervals , the obtained approximated attractor ( _ synthesized attractor _ ) is approximately identical to the one corresponding to @xmath38 ( _ averaged attractor _ ) for whatever considered set of values for @xmath39 the algorithm , we call hereafter _ synthesis algorithm _ ( sa ) , consists in using a time - periodically parameter switching , according to some designed rule .",
    "it will be demonstrated empirically , that any desired attractor can be duly obtained by the proposed switching scheme .",
    "moreover , we found out numerically and computationally that sa can be applied not only via some periodic parameter switching rule ( as analytically proved in @xcite ) , but using any kind of random switching way .",
    "let @xmath40 be the set of all attractors depending on the parameter @xmath20 , including attractive stable fixed points , stable limit cycles and chaotic attractors ; let @xmath41 be the set of the admissible values of @xmath20  and @xmath42 @xmath43 a finite ordered subset of @xmath44 which determines the set of attractors @xmath45 .",
    "it is natural to introduce a bijection between the set of all admissible values of @xmath20 and the set of all attractors .",
    "therefore , giving any @xmath20 , a unique attractor is specified , and vice versa .",
    "also , via this bijection , the order over @xmath44 induces an order over @xmath46    for the sake of simplicity , unless necessary , we denote the attractors @xmath47 simply by @xmath48    we assume that we can access all the values of @xmath49for which the system behaves stably or chaotically .    with a chosen finite subset @xmath50 ,",
    "the sa relies on the following deterministic time switching rule applied indefinitely on @xmath51 while a numerical method with fixed step size @xmath52 integrates the ivp ( [ eq1 ] )    @xmath53,\\text { } p_{i}% \\in\\mathcal{p}_{n},\\text { } i=1,2,\\ldots , n , \\label{timp}%\\ ] ]    where @xmath54,@xmath55 are finite consecutive ( adjoint ) time subintervals of length @xmath56 , for @xmath57 ( [ timp ] ) means that in each interval @xmath58 @xmath59 in other words , @xmath20 is a piece - wise continuous ( constant ) function @xmath60for @xmath61    the simplest way to implement numerically ( [ timp ] ) can be described by the scheme @xmath62 , \\label{scheme}\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 is chosen to have the length @xmath63 with @xmath64positive integers ( see section 3 ) .",

    ", we introduce the following criteria    two attractors will be considered approximately identical ( ai ) if after neglected transients , their trajectories in the phase state are close enough to each other .    the ai property is understood as a perfect as possible overlap between orbits , histograms and poincar sections ( or , ideally , the same - perfect match ) .",
    "it can be easy to verify the following property    * * [ prop ]  * * _ _ for every _ _ @xmath69 _ _ , and _ _ @xmath81__the relation ( [ eq2 ] ) can be written in the following form _ _",
    "@xmath82    _ moreover , _",
    "@xmath32 _ is a convex combination of the elements of _ @xmath50 .",
    "the last statement can be easy verified if we denote @xmath83 next ,   because @xmath84 can be written : @xmath85    let denote by @xmath86 the _ synthesized attractor _",
    ", obtained with the sa implemented by ( [ schema simpla ] ) and by @xmath87 the _ averaged attractor _ obtained for @xmath38 .",
    "now , the property mentioned at the beginning of this section can be formulated as follows :    _ for any _",
    "@xmath69 _ and _ @xmath88 _ _ , the synthesized attractor _ _",
    "@xmath86 _ belongs within the set _ @xmath89",
    "the proof is presented in @xcite , but the result can be verified by means of computational approach too .",
    "first , it can be verified computationally that @xmath86 and @xmath90with @xmath32given by ( [ p * ] ) , are ai .",
    "next , using property [ prop ] , @xmath91and taking into account the bijection between @xmath44 and @xmath40 , we are entitled to consider that the same convex structure is preserved from @xmath50 in @xmath92 then @xmath93  and therefore @xmath94 which is ai to @xmath95 belongs to @xmath96 @xmath97    \\i ) the time subintervals @xmath56 and the size of the integration step @xmath52  are parameters which may influence the results due to the convergence properties of the considered method for odes .",
    "therefore , after extensive simulations , we have chosen the best possible values of @xmath52 so that the best overlap is obtained@xmath98 however , @xmath52 is not a critical parameter",

    ", the scheme ( [ schema simpla ] ) may be applied in any random way @xcite .",
    "therefore the _ random _ sa generates again an attractor @xmath86 which , based on the mentioned above convexity property , will obviously belong inside the set of considered attractors @xmath108 endowed with the order of @xmath50 .",
    "the pseudo - code of one of the possible variants is presented in table [ tab2 ] where @xmath109 means some random generator ( in this paper with uniform distribution ) of positive integers less than or equal to @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath110 count @xmath111 @xmath32 is determined with the following formula    @xmath112    in this case , in order to obtain a better ai , the integration steps number should be taken as large as possible .",
    "[ remark]sa can not be considered as a `` true '' control algorithm ( see section 3 ) even it may generate any stable trajectory for a considered system , since before the algorithm starts , the system may evolve stable and then the algorithm just changes the behavior from a stable attractor to another one .",
    "the algorithm can be use as chaotification algorithm too , but again it should not be considered as a real anticontrol algorithm ( further informations on chaos control can be obtained e.g. from @xcite,@xcite and for anticontrol of discrete and continuous dynamical systems @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "the only condition for both control and anticontrol is that @xmath50 contain values corresponding to chaotic and stable attractors too .",
    "it should be notified that the sa can be useful when a desired value for @xmath20 can not be set directly .    to see how the sa must be implement in practice ,",
    "let us consider the sets @xmath50 and @xmath108 and suppose that certain targeted value of @xmath113 @xmath114cannot be accessible , but we want to generate the underlying attractor .",
    "by using the bifurcation diagram for the considered dynamical system , the only sufficient condition on @xmath115 is to belong to the real interval @xmath116(@xmath115 can not be chosen outside this interval because of the mentioned convexity property).@xmath100 in order to synthesize the attractor @xmath117 , we must choose @xmath118 so that the desired value @xmath115 is given by ( [ p * ] ) .",
    "this implies to solve ( [ p * ] ) considered as an equation for fixed @xmath119 with @xmath120and unknowns @xmath118 . with the obtained @xmath64values , scheme ( [ schema simpla ] )",
    "can next be applied .",
    "the synthesized attractor @xmath86 will be identical , as shown above , to @xmath117 .",
    "thus , by using the sa , one can `` force '' the system to evolve on the desired trajectory corresponding to @xmath121    another practical situation is also possible : @xmath50 and @xmath103 are not known a priori .",
    "thus , @xmath103 and the set @xmath122 have to be determined so that relation ( [ p * ] ) be verified with known @xmath115 .    in both cases ,",
    "the solutions are not unique because the elements of @xmath50 belong in a compulsory way to one of the infinite number of @xmath20-intervals which may compose @xmath44 .",
    "for example , let us consider the lorenz system with the control parameter @xmath20 , and suppose we want to synthesize , with the scheme @xmath123~$]for fixed @xmath37 a stable trajectory corresponding to @xmath124 starting from @xmath125then , one of the possible solutions to ( [ p * ] ) is @xmath126 and @xmath127 for which ( [ p * ] ) is verified : @xmath128",
    "for the rikitake system modeled by the equations ( [ ivp ] ) , we have    @xmath129{c}% -ax_{1}+x_{2}x_{3}\\\\ -ax_{2}+x_{1}x_{3}\\\\ 1-x_{1}x_{2}% \\end{array } \\right )   , \\text { } a=\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{ccc}% 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ -1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right )   .\\ ] ]    throughout this paper the parameter @xmath130 is set to the value @xmath131    in order to apply sa , the bifurcation diagram ( fig.[fig4 ] ) is a useful tool to study the character of the attractors .    in the same figure , the attractors used in achieving the synthesis are plotted together with the synthesized attractors .",
    "numerical simulations of the rikitake system suggest that the system has attractors which are obviously bounded .",
    "in other words , the solutions enter a ball around the origin from which they never escape .",
    "however , this seems not to be true , since if we take as an initial condition @xmath132the exact solution of ( [ ivp ] ) is @xmath133 @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath99but this solution is unstable , the @xmath0-axis being an invariant manifold .",
    "there are orbits which escape to , or come from , infinity , instead of going towards the attractor .",
    "if the flow is on the @xmath0-axis it never escapes ; if the flow is not on the @xmath0-axis , then it can never enter .",
    "because of the mentioned symmetry of solutions , for points arbitrary close to the @xmath0-axis , the flow takes the trajectory back to a bounded attractor ( results on boundedness of solutions to third - order nonlinear differential equations can be found in @xcite ) .    even though for the above mentioned reasons in some papers the @xmath0-axis is regarded as unimportant to the dynamics of the system , we found interesting dynamics due to @xmath0-axis instability .",
    "thus , for @xmath135we have found a new and intriguing case which can be considered a kind of `` transient attractor '' ta ( see fig.[fig5 ] ( a ) where the three - dimensional plot is shown and fig.[fig5 ] ( d - f ) where the phase projections have been drawn)@xmath98 ta is actually only a kind of extremely long time transient ( its existence being for @xmath136with @xmath137 close to @xmath138 ) before the trajectory reaches the real attractor , a stable limit cycle denoted @xmath139(see fig.[fig5 ] ( b ) where one can see the limit cycle @xmath4 whose magnified three - dimensional phase plot is shown in fig . 5 ( c ) ) .",
    "the dashed lines in fig.[fig5 ] ( f ) indicate the well - defined movement sense of ta .",
    "the periodic characteristics of @xmath4 can be observed in the three time series , corresponding to @xmath140 @xmath141 and @xmath142depicted in fig.[fig5 ] ( g ) , ( j ) and ( m ) for @xmath143 $ ] .",
    "the dashed line indicates the moment @xmath144when @xmath145is born .",

    "it can be seen that the size of ta is of the order of @xmath153 as compared to the small size of the @xmath4 which is nearly @xmath154 times smaller . because a part of the trajectory lies on the @xmath0-axis ( or is very close to it ( see e.g. fig.[fig5 ] ( d),(e),(f ) )",
    ", the distance being in this case not highlighted by the numerical method ) , we suspect that the ta appears because of @xmath0-axis instability . on this path along the @xmath0-axis ,",
    "the speed of the ta is very slow as compared to the loop speed ( see the vertical peeks in the time series in fig.[fig5 ] ( g),(j),(m ) and the details @xmath155 in fig.[fig5 ] ( h),(k),(n ) )",
    ". being a stiff system , not all numerical methods have proved to be adequate to obtain the ta . however , the many simulations and the ta geometric symmetry , encouraged us to consider ta as being not just some `` false '' trajectory due to numerical integration , but a real representative component of the insight dynamics of the rikitake system .      by applying the deterministic or random sa , any attractor of rikitake s system may be synthesized .",
    "the standard runge - kutta method has been utilized and the most representative cases has been considered .",

    "<S> in this paper the attractors synthesis algorithm for a class of dissipative dynamical systems with hyperbolic equilibria , presented in @xcite , is applied to generate any attractor of the rikitake system . by switching periodically , or even randomly , the control parameter inside a given set of values , during any finite time interval while the attractor is numerically approximated , any attractor can be generated . beside the extension of the synthesis algorithm to systems with non - hyperbolic equilibria </S>",
    "<S> , we have found for the rikitake system , a new intriguing transient which , occurring for a long time interval , is difficult to be numerically found due to the known system instability along the @xmath0-axis .    </S>",
