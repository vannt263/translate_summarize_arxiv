    "the abundance of exoplanetary data has legitimized several new fields of inquiry . among these",
    "is the theoretical study of exoplanetary atmospheres via detailed numerical simulations ( for reviews see @xcite ) , which describe the atmospheric dynamics , its radiative transfer , as well as  in principle  the chemistry and the cloud physics @xcite . the complexity of atmospheric modelling and its inherent non - linearity motivate clean comparisons between studies that either utilize different methods of solution or even implement the same methods differently @xcite .    in the geophysical fluid dynamics community ,",
    "it has long been suggested by @xcite that a useful comparison is between `` dynamical cores '' , which are codes that deal with the essential dynamics of an atmosphere and omit details such as radiative transfer . in a pair of benchmark calculations",

    "attempts have been made ( e.g. , @xcite versus @xcite ) to compare hot jupiter models , but these were performed via different simulation platforms . in this study , we generalize held - suarez - type benchmarks to include tidally - locked exoplanets , using a single simulation platform  namely the dynamical cores of the _ flexible modeling system _ ` ( fms ) ` .",
    "our main finding is that while we can achieve qualitative and quantitative agreement for the earth ( and shallow hot jupiter ) tests , noticeable differences appear when we simulate the deep atmospheric circulation of the hot jupiter hd 209458b .",
    "closer agreement may be attained by specifying arbitrary values for the horizontal dissipation parameters  by trial and error  but it remains the case that the _ magnitude _ of the horizontal dissipation can not be rigorously specified .",
    "dynamical uncertainties at the level of @xmath0 therefore exist both between simulations utilizing different methods of solutions and also within the same method of solution , which may ultimately have implications for studies attempting to match observed versus simulated atmospheres of extrasolar planets .",
    "operationally , we implement both the spectral and finite difference cores of the ` fms ` and subject them to a battery of tests , including the held - suarez benchmark for earth (  [ subsect : hs94 ] ) , a hypothetical tidally - locked earth (  [ subsect : tidalearth ] ; @xcite ) , a `` shallow '' hot jupiter model (  [ subsect : mr09 ] ; @xcite ) and a `` deep '' model for hd 209458b (  [ subsect : hd209458b ] ; @xcite ) . in  [ sect : equations ] , we discuss the governing equations handled by meteorological solvers such as the ` fms ` . in  [ sect : fms ] , we briefly describe the ` fms ` .",

    "other points deserve to be emphasized .",
    "firstly , the spectral simulations manifestly capture the details of fine flow features better than the finite difference simulations , which is likely because the latter ( with @xmath34 ) are more dissipative than the former ( with @xmath103 hd 209458b day ) . secondly , there are clear qualitative differences between the snapshots from the spectral and finite difference simulations , which show @xmath104 variations in the temperature field .",
    "the third point concerns model variations and the level of variability in the temperature field at @xmath99 mbar , which we illustrate in figure [ fig : temp_var ] . for the spectral simulations ( left panel of figure [ fig : temp_var ] ) , it is apparent that there are @xmath104 variations in the temperature field as a function of time and the magnitudes of the variations are roughly equal across resolution ( t21t63 ) . for the finite difference simulations ( right panel of figure [ fig : temp_var ] ) , the g72 simulations also show @xmath104 variations in the temperature field at @xmath99 mbar whereas the g24 and g36 simulations show less variation , consistent with our earlier statement that the latter simulations are more dissipative ( compared to their g72 counterpart ) .",

    "the level of variability present and its dependence on the magnitude of the horizontal dissipation applied will have implications for the study of variability in these model atmospheres for hot jupiters .",
    "the discrepancies in the predicted temperature fields may be due to the different temporal evolutions within each simulation  even a pair of identical models seeded with slightly different ( and random ) initial perturbations may lead to different temporal evolutions .",

    "the temperature profiles between our pair of simulations are in good agreement .",

    "the t31 and t63 simulations agree reasonably well with one another at a given vertical resolution ( l33 or l66 ) , whereas the wind speed predictions from the t21 simulations are discrepant with the t31 and t63 ones , suggesting that the t21 simulations are under - resolved . for the finite difference simulations , the predictions for the wind speeds are also in agreement at a given vertical resolution ( l33 versus l66 ) .",
    "simulations with lower horizontal resolution predict lower wind speeds , consistent with our earlier statement that they are more dissipative ( at a fixed value of @xmath93 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the depth at which the super - rotating wind is the fastest is a robust feature of the simulations , occurring at about 0.05 bar in the finite difference simulations ( versus about 0.08 in the corresponding set of spectral simulations ) .",
    "we note that inter - comparison of the results between each panel of figure [ fig : winds2 ] does not constitute a fair exercise , because the assumed magnitude of horizontal dissipation is different for each suite of simulations .",
    "even the intra - comparison of results within the right panel of figure [ fig : winds2 ] may not be straightforward , because as we discussed previously keeping @xmath93 fixed while varying the resolution in effect changes the analogue of the hyperviscosity , but we do not know of a clear way of varying @xmath93 in a  resolution independent \" manner ( see appendix [ append : efold ] ) .",
    "the best we can conclude from figure [ fig : winds2 ] is that the predictions for the maximum zonal wind speed , from both the spectral and finite difference simulations , are resolution - dependent . in tandem with figure [ fig : winds ]",
    ", one may also conclude that since the specification of horizontal dissipation is a more lucid endeavour within the spectral core , comparing results from the spectral and finite difference simulations should only be performed when held - suarez statistics from the latter are calibrated to match those produced by the former . in this sense ,",

    "we find that while the dynamical cores of the ` fms ` produce qualitative and quantitative agreement for the earth , tidally - locked earth and shallow hot jupiter tests , the agreement is less than satisfactory for a deep model of the hot jupiter hd 209458b .",
    "further investigation reveals that closer agreement can be attained by arbitrarily adjusting the values of the horizontal dissipation parameters in the two dynamical cores , but there is no rigorous way to pick the magnitude of the horizontal dissipation in these models .",
    "our findings suggest that even without dealing with additional physics such as radiative transfer or atmospheric chemistry , discrepancies in the temperature and velocity fields , at the level of @xmath115 and several tens of percent respectively , already exist for the dynamics alone . in this context ,",
    "direct measurements of wind velocity in a hot jupiter atmosphere , as recently reported by @xcite , are important as they could prove to be particularly constraining for the models .    in general ,",
    "weakly - dissipative spectral simulations are expected to be sensitive to the choice of horizontal dissipation parameter ( @xmath92 ) , in the sense that they tend to fail as a result of small - scale noise accumulation ( `` spectral blocking '' ) if the horizontal dissipation is not chosen to be strong enough .",
    "therefore , to the extent that spectral simulations with the largest possible value of @xmath92 ( i.e. , the weakest possible horizontal dissipation ) are more trustworthy  as conventional wisdom would suggest  our findings could also be interpreted as indicating that results in the literature based on finite difference methods may somewhat _ over - estimate _ the magnitude of wind speeds in hot jupiter atmospheres ( see figure [ fig : winds ] ) . however , until the nature of horizontal dissipation in these atmospheres is better understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one should probably not interpret these trends as more than suggestive .",
    "operationally , our suite of benchmark tests provides a reference for researchers wishing to adapt their codes to simulate atmospheric circulation on tidally - locked extrasolar planets , regardless of whether the codes solve the primitive or full navier - stokes equations .",
    "the salient points of our study are :    * we have generalized the held - suarez dynamical benchmark for earth to include tidally - locked exoplanets using a single simulation platform ( the ` fms ` ) .",

    "* qualitative and quantitative agreement between the spectral and finite difference simulations of the deep - atmosphere benchmark test for the hot jupiter hd 209458b can be attained if arbitrarily adjusted values of the horizontal dissipation parameters are adopted .",
    "however , the difficulty remains that the _ magnitude _ of the horizontal dissipation can not ( yet ) be specified from first principles .",
    "this in turn leads to dynamical uncertainties at the level of @xmath0 which limit our ability to accurately model these atmospheres , especially with respect to wind velocities .",

    "for example , figure [ fig : uneven_sigma ] shows three implementations of equation ( [ eq : uneven_sigma ] ) , where @xmath123 is evenly spaced only for @xmath124 .",
    "to aid the reader in reproducing our results , we provide convenient polynomial fits to @xmath71 , @xmath69 and @xmath78 . the radiative relaxation time is approximated by a 4th order polynomial fit , @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",

    "our fits presented in equations ( [ eq : tnight ] ) and ( [ eq : tday ] ) are valid for @xmath130 .    for completeness , we also provide a polynomial fit to the solid curve presented in figure 1 of @xcite : @xmath131 this fit is valid for @xmath130 .",

    "]    a plausible way of determining the analogue of the numerical dissipation time @xmath92 ( for the spectral core ) in the case of the finite difference core  we shall denote this by @xmath132  is to turn off all of the dynamical terms in the simulation except for damping and record the e - folding time for initial grid - scale noise ( in velocity ) to decay away . for completeness",
    ", we perform this task for a horizontal mixing scheme of both second and fourth order in wind , while retaining a fourth order temperature scheme at all times .",
    "note that the simulation results presented in the paper are all associated with a fourth order scheme in _ both _ wind and temperature .",
    "figure [ fig : efold ] shows our measurements of @xmath132 as a function of the horizontal mixing coefficient @xmath93 . as expected , the horizontal mixing scheme of second order in wind is more dissipative ( smaller @xmath132 values ) than the fourth order one . for convenience , we provide fitting functions to these results : @xmath133 the fits are valid for @xmath134 and only for the deep model of hd 209458b ( cf . ",
    "[ subsect : hd209458b ] and table [ tab : params ] ) .",
    "for example , with the wind scheme being fourth order , we get @xmath135 hd 209458b day for the fiducial value of @xmath34 .",
    "it is important to note that the measurements of @xmath132 are identical for the g24 , g36 and g72 simulations , implying that @xmath93 is strictly speaking the analogue of the dissipation time @xmath92 and not the hyperviscosity @xmath96 , further implying that comparing spectral and finite difference simulations with different values of @xmath93 and @xmath92 ( figure [ fig : winds ] ) is a meaningful exercise . within the ` fms ` , specifying @xmath93 constitutes a  resolution dependent \" approach in that the smallest resolvable waves in the simulation are damped with a strength that is equal for every resolution .",
    "unfortunately , there is no way within the ` fms ` b - grid core ( ` memphis ` release ) to switch to a  resolution independent \" approach of specifying the magnitude of horizontal mixing , unlike in the case of the spectral core .",
    "it is also not clear how to convert @xmath93 into a quantity that is the true analogue of the hyperviscosity .",
    "the implication is that comparing simulations at different resolutions , with the same value of @xmath93 , may not be a fair exercise since the analogue of the hyperviscosity is different in each of these runs ( figure [ fig : rm10_hd209458b_res2 ] and the right panel of figure [ fig : winds2 ] ) .",
    "even if we take figure [ fig : efold ] at face value , the correspondence between @xmath92 and @xmath132 is not straightforward .",
    "for example , the pair of simulations in figure [ fig : rm10_hd209458b_hs_adjusted ] use @xmath136 hd 209458b day and @xmath113 , but figure [ fig : efold ] informs us that @xmath113 corresponds to @xmath137 hd 209458b day ( using the horiziontal mixing scheme of fourth order in wind ) .",
    "if we insist on matching the @xmath113 simulation with the @xmath103@xmath138 hd 209458 day simulations , then figure [ fig : winds ] informs us that we are now faced with the original problem of the predictions for the maximum zonal wind speeds being discrepant ."
