    "the purpose of this chapter is to present the recently developed interaction between mapping class groups of surfaces , including braid groups , and richard j. thompson s groups @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we follow here the present authors geometrical approach , while giving some hints to the algebraic developments of brin and dehornoy and the quasi - conformal approach of de faria , gardiner and harvey .    when compared to mapping - class groups , already thoroughly studied by dehn and nielsen , thompson s groups appear quite recent",
    ". introduced by richard j. thompson in the middle of the 1960s , they originally developed from algebraic logic ; however , a pl representation of them was immediately obtained .",
    "recall that thompson s group @xmath2 is the group of pl homeomorphisms of @xmath3 $ ] which locally are of the form @xmath4 , with breaks in @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the group @xmath6 acts in a similar way on the unit circle @xmath7 .",
    "the group @xmath1 acts by left continuous bijections on @xmath3 $ ] as a group of affine interval exchanges .",
    "this action may be lifted to a continous one on the triadic cantor set .    by conjugating these groups via the farey map sending the rationals to the dyadics , one obtains a similar definition as groups of piecewise @xmath8 maps with rational breakpoints ; this definition already has a certain 2-dimensional flavour .",
    "observe that thompson s groups act near the boundary of the hyperbolic disk and thus near the boundary of the infinite binary tree .",
    "this observation played a basic role in the beginning of the material discussed here . from this point of view",
    "thompson s group @xmath6 is a piecewise generalisation of @xmath9 ; the mapping class group is a multi - handle generalisation of @xmath10 . in the same vein",
    "@xmath11 is an arithmetic generalization and @xmath12 is a non - commutative one .",
    "we also note that , following thurston , the mapping class group @xmath13 acts on the boundary of the teichmller space and preserves its piecewise projective integral structure .    another way to encode these groups is to consider pairs of binary trees which represent dyadic subdivisions .",
    "dually , this data gives a simplicial bijection of the complementary forests , called partial automorphism of the infinite binary tree @xmath14 .",
    "of course this does not extend as an automorphism of @xmath14 .",
    "however , one observes the following simple but essential fact : if one thickens the infinite tree @xmath14 to a surface @xmath15 , then the corresponding partial homeomorphisms extend to the entire surface @xmath15 .",
    "thus , two objects appear here : the surface @xmath15 and the mapping class group which lifts the elements of a thompson group .    to make definitions precise , we are forced to endow the surface @xmath15 with a rigid structure which encodes its tree - like aspect .",
    "the homeomorphisms we consider are asymptotically rigid , i.e. they preserve the rigid structure outside a compact sub - surface .",
    "these homeomorphisms give rise to the asymptotically rigid mapping class groups .",
    "we now give some details on the structure of this chapter .",
    "we present in section 1 various constructions of groups and spaces and explain how the group @xmath6 itself is a mapping class group of @xmath15 .",
    "next , we introduce the ( historically ) first relation between thompson groups and braid groups , namely the extension : @xmath16 in order to avoid working with non - finitely supported braids , the authors chose to build @xmath17 from a convenient geometric homomorphism @xmath18 however , retrospectively , while having definite advantages , this choice may not have been the best .",
    "the main theorem of @xcite says that the group @xmath17 is almost acyclic  the corresponding group @xmath19 being acyclic .",
    "the proofs of these theorems are quite involved and far from the geometric - combinatorial topics discussed in the rest of this chapter ; this is why we shall present them rather sketchyly .",
    "however , we do describe the group @xmath17 as a mapping class group .",
    "it is actually while trying to extend the burau representation from @xmath20 to @xmath17 that the notion of asymptotically rigid mapping class group was formulated .",
    "the next two sections , 2 and 3 , are of central importance .",
    "we show that a group @xmath21 which is an asymptotically rigid mapping class group of @xmath15 and surjects onto @xmath1 is finitely presented . while the acyclicity theorem mentioned above",
    "was formulated on the basis of homotopy - theoretic evidence , the group @xmath21 and its finite presentability came largely from conformal field theory evidence .",
    "the moore - seiberg duality groupoid is finitely presented , a fact mathematically established in @xcite .",
    "we begin by introducing penner s ptolemy groupoid , partly issued from the conformal field theory work of friedan and shenker .",
    "its objects are ideal tesselations and its morphisms are compositions of flips .",
    "we then explain how thompson s groups fit into this setting .",
    "a basic observation here is that the ptolemy groupoid is isomorphic to a sub - groupoid of the moore - seiberg stable duality groupoid .",
    "this duality groupoid is related in turn to a hatcher - thurston type complex for the surface @xmath15 .",
    "one main result is that this complex is simply connected .",
    "section 3 applies all this to the asymptotically rigid mapping class group @xmath21 of @xmath15 .",
    "let us emphasize here that our notion of asymptotically rigid mapping class group is different from the asymptotic mapping class group considered recently by various authors ( see the chapter written by matsuzaki in volume iv of this handbook ) .",
    "the kernel of the morphism from @xmath21 onto @xmath1 is the compactly supported mapping class group of @xmath15 .",
    "let us note that the group @xmath21 contains all genus zero mapping class groups as well as the braid groups .",
    "the main theorem states that @xmath21 is a finitely presented group .",
    "a quite compact symmetric set of relations is produced as well .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to the braided ptolemy - thompson group @xmath22 .",
    "this is an extension of @xmath6 by the braid group @xmath20 .",
    "it is an asymptotically rigid mapping class group of @xmath15 of a special kind .",
    "it is a simpler group than @xmath17 and will be used in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "we prove that @xmath22 , like @xmath21 , is a finitely presented group .",
    "we note that so far , @xmath17 is only known to be finitely generated .",
    "in section 5 , we consider a relative abelianisation of @xmath22 : @xmath23\\to t^*/[b_{\\infty } , b_{\\infty}]\\to t\\to 1\\ ] ] we prove that this central extension is classified by a multiple of the euler class of @xmath6 that we detect to be @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the euler class pulled - back to @xmath6 .",
    "this fact eventually allows us to classify the dilogarithmic projective extension of @xmath6 which arises in the quantization of the teichmller theory , as we explain as well .",
    "in section 6 we discuss an infinite genus mapping class group that maps onto @xmath1 which is proved to be ( at least ) finitely generated .",
    "it also has the property of being homologically equivalent to the stable mapping class group .",
    "as already mentioned , the proofs involve as a key ingredient the group @xmath22 .    in section 7",
    "we introduce a simplicial unified approach to the various extensions of the group @xmath1 .",
    "this includes the extension @xmath26 of matt brin and patrick dehornoy coming from categories with multiplication and from the geometry of algebraic laws , respectively .",
    "moreover , one can approach in this way the action of the grothendieck - teichmller group on a @xmath1-completion @xmath27 of @xmath21 , thus getting a quite neat presentation of the entire setting .    a sample of open questions is contained in the final section",
    ".    we would like to dedicate these notes to the memory of peter greenberg and of alexander reznikov .",
    "their work is inspiring us forever .",

    "a _ finite binary rooted planar tree _ is a finite planar tree having a unique 2-valent vertex , called the _ root _ , a set of monovalent vertices called the _ leaves _ , and whose other vertices are 3-valent .",
    "the planarity of the tree provides a canonical labelling of its leaves , in the following way .",
    "assuming that the plane is oriented , the leaves are labelled from 1 to @xmath43 , from left to right , the root being at the top and the leaves at the bottom .",
    "there exists a bijection between the set of dyadic subdivisions of @xmath3 $ ] and the set of finite binary rooted planar trees .",
    "indeed , given such a tree , one may label its vertices by dyadic intervals in the following way .",

    "as we have just seen , an element of thompson s group @xmath1 is defined by the data of two dyadic subdivisions of @xmath3 $ ] , with the same cardinality @xmath43 , plus a permutation @xmath47 .",
    "this amounts to encoding it by a pair of finite binary rooted trees with the same number of leaves @xmath31 , plus a permutation @xmath47 .",
    "thus , an element @xmath49 of @xmath1 is represented by a triple @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 have the same number of leaves @xmath31 , and @xmath70 belongs to the symmetric group @xmath71 .",
    "such a triple will be called a _ symbol _ for @xmath49 .",
    "it is convenient to interpret the permutation @xmath70 as the bijection @xmath72 which maps the @xmath73-th leaf of the source tree @xmath68 to the @xmath74-th leaf of the target tree @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath49 belongs to @xmath2 , the permutation @xmath70 , which is the identity , is not represented , and the symbol reduces to a pair of trees @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath49 belongs to @xmath6 , the cyclic permutation is graphically materialized by a small circle surrounding the leaf number @xmath76 of @xmath69 .",
    "one introduces the following equivalence relation on the set of symbols : two symbols are equivalent if they represent the same element of @xmath1 .",
    "one denotes by @xmath77 $ ] the equivalence class of the symbol .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 is ( in bijection with ) the set of equivalence classes of symbols .",
    "the composition law of piecewise dyadic affine bijections is pushed out on the set of equivalence classes of symbols in the following way . in order to define @xmath78\\cdot[\\tau_1,\\tau_0,\\sigma]$ ] , one may suppose , at the price of refining both symbols , that the tree @xmath69 coincides with the tree @xmath79 .",

    "each finite binary rooted planar tree @xmath82 can be embedded in a unique way into @xmath84 , assuming that the embedding maps the root of @xmath82 onto the root of @xmath84 , and respects the orientation .",

    "let @xmath97 be the boundary of @xmath84 ( also called the set of `` ends '' of @xmath84 ) endowed with its usual topology , for which it is a cantor set .",
    "the point is that a partial automorphism does not act ( globally ) on the tree , but does act on its boundary .",
    "one has therefore a morphism @xmath98 , whose image @xmath99 is the _ spheromorphism group of neretin_.    let now @xmath100 be the sub - monoid of @xmath96 , whose elements are the partial automorphisms which respect the local orientation of the edges .",
    "thompson s group @xmath1 can be viewed as the subgroup of @xmath99 which is the image of @xmath100 by the above morphism .",
    "there exists a neretin group @xmath101 for each integer @xmath102 , as introduced in @xcite ( with different notation ) .",
    "they are constructed in a similar way as @xmath99 , by replacing the dyadic complete ( rooted or unrooted ) tree by the p - adic complete ( rooted or unrooted ) tree .",
    "they are proposed as combinatorial or @xmath103-adic analogues of the diffeomorphism group of the circle .",
    "some aspects of this analogy have been studied in @xcite .",
    "most readers of this section are probably more comfortable with the mapping class group than with thompson s groups .",
    "therefore , we think that it will be useful to gather here some of the classical and less classical properties of thompson s groups . there is a fair amount of randomness in our choices and the only thing we would really like to emphasize is their ubiquity .",
    "thompson s groups became known in algebra because @xmath6 and @xmath1 were the first infinite finitely presented simple groups .",
    "they were preceded by higman s example of an infinite finitely generated simple group in 1951 .",
    "more recently , burger and mozes ( see @xcite ) constructed an example which is also without torsion .",
    "thompson used @xmath2 and @xmath1 to give new examples of groups with an unsolvable word problem and also in his algebraic characterisation of groups with a solvable word problem ( see @xcite ) as being those which embed in a finitely generated simple subgroup of a finitely presented group . the group @xmath2 was rediscovered in homotopy theory , as a universal conjugacy idempotent , and later in universal algebra .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an introduction from scratch to several aspects of thompson s groups , including their presentations , and also their piecewise linear and projective representations .",
    "one can find as well an introduction to the amenability problem for @xmath2 , including a proof of the brin - squier - thompson theorem that @xmath2 does not contain a free group of rank 2 .",
    "last but not least , one can find a list of the merely 25 notations in the literature for @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "fortunately , after @xcite appeared , the notation has almost stabilized .",
    "we also mention the survey @xcite for various other aspects and @xcite and @xcite for the general topic of homeomorphisms of the circle .",
    "the groups @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 are actually @xmath104 , i.e. they have classifying spaces with finite skeleton in each dimension ; this was first proved by brown and geoghegan ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us mention what is the rational cohomology of these groups , computed by ghys and sergiescu in @xcite and brown in @xcite .",
    "first , @xmath105 is the product between the divided powers algebra on one generator of degree 2 and the cohomology algebra of the 2-torus .",
    "the cohomology of @xmath6 is the quotient @xmath106 , where @xmath25 is the euler class and @xmath107 a ( discrete ) godbillon - vey class . in what concerns the group @xmath1 its rational cohomology vanishes in each dimension .",
    "see @xcite for more results with either @xmath108 or with twisted coefficients .    here",
    "are other properties of these groups involving cohomology . using a smoothening of thompson s group",
    "it is proved in @xcite that there is a representation @xmath109 having euler number @xmath110 and an invariant cantor set .",
    "reznikov showed that the group @xmath6 does not have kazhdan s property @xmath6 ( see @xcite ) , and later farley @xcite proved that it has haagerup property at ( also called a - t - menability ) .",
    "therefore it verifies the baum - connes conjecture ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "napier and ramachandran proved that @xmath2 is not a khler group @xcite .",
    "cyclic cocycles on @xmath6 were introduced in @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath6 in relation with the symplectic automorphisms of @xmath111 was considered by usnich in @xcite .    a theorem of brin @xcite states that the group of outer automorphisms of @xmath6 is @xmath112 .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the authors computed the abstract commensurator of @xmath2 . using the above mentioned smoothening , it is proved in @xcite that all rotation numbers of elements in @xmath6 are rational .",
    "new direct proofs were given by calegari ( @xcite ) , liousse ( @xcite ) and kleptsyn ( unpublished ) .",

    "guba ( @xcite ) showed that the dehn function for @xmath2 is quadratic .",
    "the group @xmath2 was studied in cryptography in @xcite .",
    "thompson s groups were studied from the viewpoint of @xmath114-algebras and von neumann algebras ; see for instance jolissaint ( @xcite ) and haagerup - picioroaga @xcite .    on the edge of logic and group",
    "theory , the interpretation of arithmetic in thompson s groups was investigated by bardakov - tolstykh ( @xcite ) and altinel - muranov ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us finally mention the work of guba and sapir on thompson s groups as diagram groups ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize here that we avoided to speak on generalisations of thompson s groups : this topic is pretty large and we think it would not be at its place here .",
    "let us close this section by mentioning again that our choice was just to mention some developments related to thompson s groups from the unique angle of ubiquity .",
    "the article @xcite is partly devoted to developing the notion of an asymptotically rigid homeomorphism .    1 .",
    "let @xmath115 be the oriented surface of genus zero , which is the following inductive limit of compact oriented genus zero surfaces with boundary @xmath116 : starting with a cylinder @xmath117 , one gets @xmath118 from @xmath116 by gluing a pair of pants ( i.e. a three - holed sphere ) along each boundary circle of @xmath116 .",
