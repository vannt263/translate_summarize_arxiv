    "1994 , 1996 , 1998 ) . by active control of the primary  mirror figure and secondary  mirror alignment ( chrysostomou et al . 1998 ) and tip  tilt actuation of the secondary mirror under control of a fast guider , this goal has been met ( hawarden et al . 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "the telescope routinely delivers images with fwhm less than 0.@xmath06 . in 1998",
    "a programme to measure the delivered seeing was undertaken .",
    "images were taken with the infrared camera , ircam , and the median seeing was found to be 0.@xmath045 .",
    "some images obtained in this programme in september 1998 , had a delivered fwhm of 0.@xmath017 .",
    "the new facility imager , the ukirt fast track imager ( ufti ) , was delivered at the end of 1998 . at the beginning of 2001 , a programme to regularly monitor the delivered seeing with ufti was initiated . in this paper we present results from this programme and compare them with pure atmospheric seeing , as measured from the rms in the focus position , @xmath2 .",
    "throughout 2001 , ukirt s delivered image quality was regularly monitored with ufti . whenever ufti is in use the orac - dr imaging pipeline ( economou et al .",
    "1999 , currie 2001 ) automatically performs photometry on all standard  star frames taken , and a gaussian fit is used to estimate the fwhm of the central source .",
    "the pipeline calculates the best  fitting elliptical gaussian point ",
    "spread function ( psf ) using the starlink kappa ( currie & berry 2000 ) package .",
    "the psf task forms marginal profiles at 45@xmath3intervals about the weighted centroid ( from task centroid ) within a 9.@xmath02 square .",
    "it rejects outliers from any neighbouring sources by ensuring that the intensity declines radially , and excludes bad pixels . for each profile",
    ", psf fits a gaussian curve , iteratively solving normal equations after background ( lower quartile ) subtraction .",
    "the combined profiles yield approximate values for the gaussian width , axis ratio and orientation .",
    "psf averages the pixel data into isophotal elliptical annuli about the star image centre .",
    "iterative ellipse fitting generates the accurate minor  axis fwhm , axis ratio and orientation .",
    "the pipeline logs the geometric mean of the major and minor  axis fwhm in arcseconds .",
    "single  component models like the gaussian or even the twin ",
    "parameter srsic function ( srsic 1968 ) are poor representations of the ukirt point  spread function under excellent seeing conditions ( see the ukirt web pages , http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/jacpublic/ukirt/telescope/telescope.html ) . even in poor conditions",
    "the gaussian overestimates the width of the spiky inner core .",
    "nevertheless , for monitoring performance over a period , the gaussian fwhm offers a simple , easily interpreted statistic .",
    "the results are rich in statistical information and are analyzed by a code produced by the authors . in order to avoid extended objects , we only employ observations of ukirt faint standards . finally , the code corrects the measurements to their equivalents at 1.0 airmasses and the k band , using standard dependences of the image size on airmass ( i.e. seeing at zenith @xmath4 airmass@xmath5 ) and wavelength ( i.e. seeing at 2.2@xmath1 m @xmath4",

    "the histogram for the ut range 68 hours ( hst 2022 hours ) in figure 1 shows that by this time , the delivered image diameter has essentially stabilized , helped by the dome ventilation system .",

    "focus excursions measured by the autofocus system are a measure of atmospheric seeing .",
    "standard atmospheric theory predicts that the seeing ",
    "induced image diameter is linearly related to the rms atmospheric  induced focus fluctuations , @xmath2 . in this mode , the fast guider is acting as a form of differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) .",
    "@xmath2 should therefore be a robust and invaluable measure of the atmospheric seeing ( as opposed to delivered image quality ) at ukirt .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is measured every time the telescope is focussed . during focussing , the fast guider re  images the telescope focal plane on the ccd using one of two lens systems mounted in a wheel .",
    "a single lens is employed for normal guide , acquisition and focus modes . for auto ",
    "focus a second , similar lens is equipped with a 2@xmath72 array of 4 f/100 shack ",
    "hartmann lenslets mounted immediately behind it . instead of a single image",
    "these produce 4 images of the star , in a plane somewhat nearer the lens wheel than the single image used for normal guiding .",
    "the longitudinal position of the image formed by the front lens on its own depends on the overall focus of the telescope .",
    "consequently the diameter of the converging pencil in any plane between the lens and its image is a measure of the telescope focus .",
    "the four sub  images are formed from sub  pupils of the converging cone from the single lens , so the radial separation of the four images is also a measure of the overall telescope focus setting . in auto ",
    "focus mode the four images are sensed by a 24@xmath724 array of pixels , which are again binned up 3@xmath73 , now into 8@xmath78 superpixels forming four ( rather than one ) 4@xmath74 guiding arrays .    in autofocus mode",
    "the image positions are sensed at a rate of 60 hz .",
    "these measurements are averaged over a specified interval , during which the rms of the focus fluctuations , @xmath2 , is also determined . because the 4@xmath74 sensor is non",
    " linear at large excursions , such as might accompany a change of instrument , when autofocus mode is initiated the 60hz focus corrections are averaged , and then applied , over consecutive periods of 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 and 32 seconds , first to facilitate convergence and then to allow seeing  induced fluctuations to be averaged out .",
    "the 32s averaging is then repeated indefinitely , until @xmath2 is seen to stabilise .    to convert @xmath2 to atmospheric seeing the transformation shown in equation 1",
    "is used . in equation 1 , the diffraction limit , 0.@xmath015 is added in quadrature with the contribution from @xmath2 to give the atmospheric seeing .",
    "@xmath9    this equation is partly empirical , as the factor of 28.5 was measured by directly comparing delivered image diameter with @xmath2 over 2 nights from 1999 july 2930 , when a single bright star was imaged in the _ k _ band while simultaneously guiding in autofocus mode . the data from these two nights can be seen in figure [ fig : massey ] .",
    "using this transformation we have performed a similar analysis to that outlined in section [ sec : dsee ] , in order to see how well @xmath2 relates to the actual delivered seeing . in this analysis we have selected values of @xmath2 from 2001 , in order to remain consistent with the analysis of the delivered ufti images .",
    "the @xmath2 logfile contains no airmass information , and so the computed atmospheric seeing was not corrected to zenith , although this is a small effect for all but extreme airmasses .

    "table 3 also shows the median seeing for each ut bin and one extra ut bin at the beginning of the night .",
    "these data show how atmospheric seeing ( as inferred from @xmath2 ) varies through the night , although this is clearly different from the delivered image quality . at all ut",
    ", the atmospheric seeing values have a significantly larger spread than the delivered fwhm .",
    "there is some evidence that the histograms are double peaked , except in the ut range from 10  12 hours . even the median atmospheric seeing shown in table 3 does not show the same trend as the delivered seeing . in this case",
    ", the median does not slowly decrease through the night while the dome and telescope structure are cooling . instead",
    "a minimum is reached at 10  12 hours , but then there is a sharp increase .",
    "the overall inferred atmospheric seeing for 2001 was approximately 0.@xmath08 , significantly larger than the delivered image fwhm of 0.@xmath06 .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : asee ] there is a theoretical link between @xmath2 and seeing .",
    "therefore , the delivered image quality should be linked to the value of @xmath2 in some way as well .",
    "measuring a diameter of a star in a delivered image is not an estimate of the seeing .",
    "faults in the optical system of both the telescope and instrumentation will degrade the best possible image by some degree .",
    "one would therefore expect the fwhm of delivered images to be worse than the fwhm estimated from @xmath2 .",
    "we would therefore , expect figures 1 and 2 to look similar , but with figure 1 having a _ higher _ median value for each histogram than figure 2 .",
    "this does not seem to be the case .",
    "the fwhm inferred from @xmath2 has both a larger median and scatter than that measured in the delivered images .    when plotting the fwhm in the delivered images against @xmath2 , reasonable agreement is found with equation 1 . in figure 5 , the mean",
    "@xmath2 has been plotted versus 11 seeing bins ( 0.@xmath030.@xmath04 , 0.@xmath040.@xmath05 etc ) .",
    "this shows that , although there is a large scatter in the value of the inferred seeing fwhm from @xmath2 compared to the delivered image fwhm ( see figures 1 and 3 ) , the mean value of @xmath2 in a large dataset tends towards value predicted by equation 1 .",
    "this suggests that the calibration used to predict equation 1 is approximately correct . however , the large scatter in @xmath2 is still a problem , especially for flexible scheduling where the value of @xmath2 is often the quickest and simplest way of flexing against the seeing .",
    "the cause of the larger median discussed above is the long tails seen in the distributions of inferred atmospheric seeing in figure 3 .",
    "the intra  night variations for both the delivered fwhm and the @xmath2 inferred fwhm have minima at some time after midnight .",
    "table 1 shows that the delivered fwhm has a minimum value of 0.@xmath053 between 1214 hours ut , rising to 0.@xmath054 between 1416 hours ( although this rise is not statistically significant ) .",
    "the minimum for atmospheric seeing occurs slightly earlier in the night , with a value of 0.@xmath058 between 1012 hours ut , and then a sharp rise to 0.@xmath076 between 1214 hours .",
    "[ fig : irsee_vs_csosee ]    figure [ f : season ] shows a plot of median delivered image fwhm versus the month of the year for both 2000 and 2001 .",
    "the statistics in table 2 , suggested that november 2001 was a very good month , but there were only a few nights available for observing in november 2001 , due to bad weather conditions .",
    "it seems that the nights that were not affected by the weather were anomalously good for that particular time of year .",
    "the best seeing for both years falls around the same time of year , i.e. from july to september .",
    "this is consistent with the 0.@xmath017 seeing images achieved at ukirt in september 1998 with ircam . in 2000",
    "a gradual increase is seen between the best months and november , whereas a discontinuous variation is seen between september and november in 2001 .",
    "this suggests that , as previously thought , november 2001 was anomalously good .",
    "there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that very good seeing can occur directly after a storm , and this may be what we are seeing in november 2001 .",
    "finally we have investigated the relationship between cso submillimetre seeing and near  infrared k  band seeing .",
    "we chose two nights on which to compare these quantities , both of which were nights devoted to observations of ukirt faint standards .",
    "the first night , 2001 march 4th , was particularly bad for ir seeing .",
    "the second night , 2001 august 14th , was particularly good for ir seeing .",
    "the measurements of ir seeing and cso seeing for these nights are plotted in figure [ fig : irsee_vs_csosee ] , which shows no correlation between these two quantities .",
    "this is not surprising since submillimetre seeing depends mainly on water vapour , whereas near  infrared seeing depends on atmospheric conditions such as wind shear .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are summarized as follows :    * the best seeing occurs in the second half of the night , generally after 2 am hst . * the best seeing occurs in the summer , between the months of july and september .",
    "this seems to be consistent with both 2000 and 2001 , and also 1997 , when seeing of 0.@xmath017 was achieved in september .",
    "* the relationship between @xmath2 and delivered image diameter is uncertain . when mean @xmath2 is plotted versus seeing bins , the relationship between the two fits the empirical model quite well .",
    "therefore , for a large dataset , the mean value of @xmath2 agrees well with the inferred seeing , but in an individual measurement , the inferred seeing can disagree with the measured image fwhm by up to @xmath1140% , due to the large scatter in @xmath2 with respect to the delivered image diameter .",
    "this impacts on how one uses @xmath2 to predict the seeing with a flexibly scheduled telescope .",
    "* there is no correlation between cso submillimetre seeing and near  infrared seeing .",
