    "source coding problem for correlated information sources was initiated by slepian and wolf @xcite .",

    "corresponding lossy coding problem was studied by wyner and ziv @xcite , where they investigated the lossy coding problem when the decoder can fully observe the side information .",
    "while the messages are encoded separately in slepian - wolf and wyner - ziv coding problems , the coding problems involving joint encoding processes has been also explored ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this paper deals with a specific coding problem involving joint encoding , which is called _ complementary delivery coding_. the block diagram of the complementary delivery coding is depicted in fig .",
    "the encoder observes messages emitted from two correlated sources , and delivers these messages to two destinations ( decoder 1 and 2 ) .",
    "each decoder reproduces one of two messages using the other message as the side information . both lossless and lossy configurations",
    "have been considered .",

    "each source is encoded separately by the corresponding slepian - wolf code , and then , the encoder sends the summation of two codewords . notice",

    "next , we propose a universal lossy complementary delivery coding scheme based on wyner - ziv codes @xcite .",
    "our scheme is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the joint probability distribution of the correlated sources .",
    "while our coding scheme can not attain the optimal rate - distortion trade - off in general , the rate - loss is upper bounded by a universal constant under some mild conditions .",
