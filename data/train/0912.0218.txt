    "one of the unsolved questions of braneworld cosmology is the existence of localized black holes on the brane .",
    "this puzzle has been investigated almost since the appearance of these alternative - to - classical - gravity models . in codimension-1 scenarios the natural first proposal was to consider the schwarzschild metric and study its black string extension into the bulk  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as intuited by the authors , this string is unstable to classical linear perturbations known as gregory - laflamme ( gl ) instability  @xcite .",
    "since then there has been an intensive research to find a full metric by using numerical techniques  @xcite or by solving the trace of the projected einstein equations on the brane  @xcite with special ansatz  @xcite or making certain assumptions on the projected weyl term coming from the bulk  @xcite . a lower dimensional version with a baados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz )  @xcite black string was also considered in  @xcite .",
    "this solution was obtained from the so - called c - metric .",
    "the thermodynamical analysis showed that the string remains stable when its transverse size is comparable to the 4-dimensional ads radius and can be unbalanced by a gl instability above that scale , breaking up to a btz brane black hole .    in codimension-2",
    "the first attempt was proposed in  @xcite as a generalization of the 4-dimensional aryal , ford , vilenkin black hole  @xcite pierced by a cosmic string .",
    "the rotating version was also presented in  @xcite , and a complete study of the gray - body factors was considered in  @xcite .",
    "another proposal came by considering a 5-dimensional bulk with a gauss - bonnet term and induced gravity on the brane  @xcite .",
    "the solutions are basically of three types .",
    "the first one is the familiar btz black hole which can be extended into the bulk with a regular horizon .",
    "the second one adds a short distance correction and describes a btz black hole conformally coupled to a scalar field .",
    "there is a third solution family that can accommodate any brane metric coefficient @xmath0 provided that it can yield a physically acceptable brane energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the corresponding generalization to 6-dimensional bulks was worked out in  @xcite , where it is shown that the only possible solution , namely a schwarzschild - ads brane black hole , needs matter in the bulk .",
    "for all these solutions the gauss - bonnet term plays a fundamental rle leading to a consistency relation that dictates the kind of bulk or brane matter necessary to sustain a black hole on the brane .",
    "the arbitrariness of @xmath0 in one of the above mentioned solutions is an interesting feature that deserves more discussion .",
    "this fact motivated us to look for more solutions that could exhibit physically acceptable brane energy - momentum tensors .",
    "specifically , we wondered if charged and rotating metrics can be included in this general @xmath0 , in particular , taking into account that the rotating btz black hole has non - diagonal elements that were not included in the original derivation of the solutions found in  @xcite . with this purpose",
    "we recur to the so - called kerr - schild method .",
    "the kerr - schild coordinates appeared for the first time when obtaining the kerr metric starting from a flat empty space .",
    "later on , a.  h.  taub  @xcite generalized this method in order to obtain new solutions by adding to a background metric a term proportional to a null geodesic vector and a scalar function @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting metric is not a coordinate transformation but a new spacetime with a different geometry .",
    "the selection of @xmath1 , although arbitrary , must fulfill certain criteria .",
    "not only it has to satisfy the einstein equations when inserted in the new metric but it must also yield a physically meaningful energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the advantage of this generalized kerr - schild ( gks ) method is that the new einstein equations are linear in @xmath1 when written in their covariant and contravariant components .",
    "we should also mention that the resulting metric can have non - diagonal terms that can be cast off by means of a coordinate transformation when no angular momentum is involved .",
    "the gks transformation appears as a useful tool in astrophysics where , for example , it can generate a singularity free metric that describes orbits close to a kerr black hole event horizon  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this kind of metric can be applied in numerical relativity to outline the geometry at the horizon and even extend it to the interior of the black hole , given the absence of singularities of these coordinates in this region .",
    "the gks transformation is also used to identify apparent horizons in boosted black holes due to its invariance under lorentz boost  @xcite .",
    "other solutions were also worked out in  @xcite .",
    "this method has also been used to find exact vacuum solutions in the context of multidimensional gravity  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we applied the gks method to extra dimensions .",
    "the background solutions are the black hole metrics described previously .",
    "due to the gauss - bonnet contribution , the einstein equations are not linear anymore even when written in their covariant - contravariant form , in fact , they are at most quadratic in the function @xmath1 . however , as we will see in this work , the method proved to be successful since the equations are still solvable , and it was possible to obtain more solutions including charge and angular momentum .",
    "it was also viable to pass from btz metrics ( pure or charged ) to the so - called corrected btz one , which includes a brane scalar field .",
    "given all these solutions it is pertinent to explore the main properties of such spacetimes .",
    "in general relativity one possible way to understand the geometrical aspect of the gravitational field is to study geodesics in the spacetime permeated by this field . over the years , the motion of massive and massless test particles in background geometries of various higher dimensional theories of gravity has been investigated  @xcite . in this work",
    "we analyse the timelike and null geodesic motion in the brane black hole spacetimes mentioned above . with this aim",
    "we solve the euler - lagrange equation for the variational problem associated with the corresponding metrics .",
    "the set of orbits turned out to be very rich .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we make a brief review of the brane black holes obtained in  @xcite .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the application of the gks method to these models displaying the corresponding results and new solutions . in section 4",
    "we present a complete study of timelike and null geodesic behaviour in the whole family of backgrounds .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss our results and conclude .",

    "in both cases although the geodesics approach the brane , they can not cross it .",
    "analogously to the non - rotating case , we see that the brane acts like a repulsive barrier that blocks the exchange of signals between brane and bulk . nevertheless , whereas lightlike geodesics are scattered when trying to reach the brane , timelike trajectories oscillate about a fix distance from the brane .",
    "( up ) and @xmath208 ( down ) . in both cases",
    "we observe that particles can not reach the brane .",
    "we can infer that the brane acts as a repulsive barrier both confining particles already on the brane and preventing the entrance of bulk particles.,title=\"fig:\",width=238 ]   ( up ) and @xmath208 ( down ) . in both cases",
    "we observe that particles can not reach the brane .",

    "again we see a repulsive barrier behaviour at the position of the brane that scatters lightlike and timelike particles .",
    "this prevents both signals originated on the brane to permeate the bulk and signals already in the bulk to arrive to the brane .",
    "in this paper we considered the black hole solutions of five dimensional gravity with a gauss - bonnet term in the bulk and an induced gravity term on a 2-brane of codimension-2  @xcite . in order to explore the possibility of having more solutions to the einstein equations we applied the kerr - shild method using as a background the above - mentioned solutions .",
    "this method adds to the original metric a term depending on a null geodesic vector and a scalar function @xmath1 . due to the presence of the gb term the resulting equations are at most quadratic in @xmath1 , but still solvable by choosing the appropriate geodesic vector . working out the einstein equations for the function @xmath1 we found additional solutions , which include charge , angular momentum , and brane scalar fields coupled to the brane black hole .",
    "the corresponding brane energy - momentum tensors were also computed .",
    "these results lead us to deduce that the solution with free @xmath0 found in  @xcite does not have any constraint of diagonality .",
    "furthermore , we studied the geodesic behaviour in the background of the original and new solutions . for this purpose",
    "we solved the euler - lagrange equations for the variational problem associated with the metric . among our results",
    "we can distinguish different cases according to the energy of the particle , the associated effective potential , and the components of the angular momentum .",
    "in the case of geodesics on the brane we can discriminate two main cases , timelike and lightlike geodesics .",
    "the timelike orbits , in general , display oscillations that can become unstable making a particle cross the event horizon and never return .",
    "nevertheless , the charged btz string - like solution shows an additional behaviour .",
    "when the charge is small , the paths are the same as those appearing in uncharged or scalar field coupled solutions ; however , as the charge grows , the minimum of the effective potential is shifted outside the event horizon and makes possible the existence of stable oscillations or bounded orbits for particles with low or negative energy . the lightlike geodesics exhibit particles with low energies crossing the event horizon .",
    "nonetheless , particles with high energies can escape from the black hole and , thus , allow the extraction of energy , a result already noticed in pure ( 2 + 1 ) btz black holes geodesic structure  @xcite .    concerning the geodesics in the bulk , we fixed @xmath209 and studied two main cases , namely , @xmath210 and @xmath208 .",
    "in the first case , we observed that timelike trajectories corresponding to particles without angular momentum are oscillating about the position of the brane .",
    "this implies that a particle leaving the brane can return to it opening up the possibility of shortcuts , _",
    "i.e. _ , paths that are shorter in the bulk than on the brane  @xcite .",
    "the same behaviour is verified for particles having an angular momentum component along the brane ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "when @xmath76 ( the particle s angular momentum component along the bulk ) is switched on , lightlike geodesics encounter a barrier - like potential around the brane .",
    "moreover , although timelike trajectories are still oscillating and approach the brane more and more as their energy increases , they never cross it .",
    "this result prevents the exchange of bulk and brane signals , _",
    "i.e. _ , particles living in the bulk do not enter the brane , and particles residing on the brane can not go far into the bulk . in the case",
    "@xmath208 , both timelike and lightlike particles undergo scattering near the brane , but move in straight lines far from it because the effective potential becomes constant at this far region .",
    "the case of a btz black string - like object with angular momentum was treated separately due to the non - diagonal terms appearing in the metric .",
    "we found that both lightlike and timelike geodesics on the brane can cross the horizon directly or after a roundabout in the ergosphere ( particles with the lowest allowed energy ) or even outer regions .",
    "however , massless particles with high energies are able to escape allowing energy extraction from the black hole . with respect to bulk geodesics",
    ", we determined that regardless the expression for @xmath211 , the effective potential has a barrier - like structure around the brane , which both yields scattering bulk geodesics and confines particles already on the brane .",
    "in particular , timelike geodesics in the background of @xmath210 oscillate around a fixed distance from the brane but never make contact with it .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate if these features remain valid in codimension-2 @xmath212 brane scenarios , and if these results may help uncover other interactions between the brane and the bulk .",
    "however , as this is out of the scope of this paper , we expect to address these questions in a future work .",
