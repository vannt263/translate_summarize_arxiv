    "the thermodynamic properties of black hole have long been researched by scientists .",
    "the radiation temperature was regarded as the surface gravity at the outer horizon [ 1 ] . for a schwarzschild black hole , it is @xmath3 where m is the mass of the black hole . and",
    "the entropy of black hole was regarded as the area of the outer event horizon [ 2 ] : @xmath4 @xmath5 where j , q are the angular momentum and electric charges of black hole .",
    "also , scientists have established the four laws of black hole thermodynamics relative to the four laws in thermodynamics [ 1,3,4 ] . and",
    "s. hawking discovered the radiation of black hole ; thus the temperature of black hole got a real significance .",
    "the temperature of black hole has been widely researched these years but the study of entropy might not be sufficient [ 5 - 9 ] .",
    "however , the entropy in formula ( 2 ) does not obey the third law of thermodynamics [ 10,11],which is nerst s theorem : according to planck gauge , the entropy of a system will vanishes when its temperature approaches to absolute zero . actually , according to formula ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , when @xmath6 ( the so called `` extremal black hole '' ) , we have @xmath7 .",
    "so this definition ( @xmath8 ) was unable to be applied to the extremal case , therefore is not the planck absolute entropy near zero temperature . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "some scientists , for instance , hawking , teitelbom , and gibbons etc.suggested to redefine the entropy of a near extremal black hole [ 12 - 17 ] , and thought it should be zero .",
    "meanwhile , some scientists , such as loranz , hiscock , zaslavskii etc .",
    "[ 18 - 23 ] insist on the former definition.now it is still being discussed .",
    "however , we agree with the first group of scientists and redefine the absolute entropy of kerr - newman black hole near zero temperature , making it not only obey the third law , but also be harmonious with other conclusions in black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the entropy we want to find should at least accord with the following three conditions : 1 .",
    "obey the bekenstein - smarr function : @xmath9 2 . obey the limit relations between t and s : @xmath10 3 .",
    "the formula will be reduced to @xmath11 when@xmath12 . accordingly , by function ( 4)(condition 1 ) , we have @xmath13 and from formula ( 3 ) , we have @xmath14 .\\ ] ]    in order to accord with condition 3 , we suppose the entropy has the form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a correction item , it may be the function of m , j , q and vanishes when j and q vanishes(condition 2 ) . from formula ( 8)",
    ", we have @xmath17 from equation ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) , we have @xmath18 putting equation ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) into ( 6 ) , we have @xmath19 from formula ( 8) and in order to accord with the condition 2 , we get when @xmath20 .",
    "so @xmath16 equals to the area of outer horizon at zero temperature . from formula ( 3 )",
    ", we have @xmath21 so that @xmath22 from formulas ( 3 ) , ( 8) and ( 12 ) , we have @xmath23 from equation ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) , we get @xmath24 which one can prove is exactly the hawking temperature . when @xmath25 we have @xmath26 , so that@xmath27 it obeys condition 2.and for an uncharged non - rotating black hole , formula ( 14 ) will be reduced to formula ( 2).thus we think formula ( 14 )",
    "may be the absolute planck entropy of near extremal kerr - newman black hole approaching to zero temperature .",
    "formula ( 15 ) can be written in another form : @xmath28 witch will be reduced to formula ( 1 ) for an uncharged non - rotating black hole . from formula ( 16 ) we get the heat capacity @xmath29 which will also be reduced to @xmath30 for an uncharged non - rotating black hole . moreover , from formula ( 16 ) we get the radiation power @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the stefan - boltzman constant .",
    "for an uncharged non - rotating black hole , we get @xmath33 we can see from this section that the redefinition of the entropy for the bear extremal kerr - newman black hole in section 2 does not conflict to other thermodynamic properties of non - extremal , uncharged or non - rotating ones .",
    "now we would like to study the microcosmic mechanism of the entropy production of near extremal kerr - newman black hole .",
    "if we choose the coordinates @xmath34 , we have the kerr - newman metric describing the geometry of a rotating charged black hole as follows : @xmath35d{\\phi } _ { } ^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ -\\frac{2(2mr-{q}_{}^{2})a{\\sin } _ { } ^{2}\\theta } { { \\sigma } _ { } ^{2}}dtd\\phi , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which we use the standard notations @xmath36 the surface gravity at the outer ( @xmath37 or inner ( @xmath38 horizon is the limit of the intrinsic acceleration b multiplied by the redshift factor@xmath39 : @xmath40 the charged particle in curved space - time obeys klein - gordon equation : @xmath41 = { \\mu } _ { 0}^{2}\\phi , \\ ] ] where@xmath42 and e are the static masss and electric charge of the particle , and @xmath43 is the vector potential of the electromagnetic field [ 9 ] : @xmath44 using the metrics ( 21 ) and formula ( 25 ) , the klein - gordon equation ( 24 ) is reduced to @xmath45\\frac{{\\partial } _ { } ^{2}}{\\partial { t}_{}^{2}}\\phi - 2a\\left[1-\\frac{({r}_{}^{2}+{a}_{}^{2})}{\\delta } \\right ] \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t } \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\phi } \\phi \\nonumber \\\\ -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\delta \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial r}\\phi   -\\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta } \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\theta } \\sin \\theta   \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\theta } \\phi + \\left(\\frac{{a}_{}^{2}}{\\delta } -\\frac{1}{{\\sin } _ { } ^{2}\\theta } \\right)\\frac{{\\partial } _ { } ^{2}}{\\partial { \\phi}_{}^{2}}\\phi        \\nonumber",

    "so we have solved the outgoing wave @xmath67 and the ingoing wave @xmath68 where we use the retarded eddington coordinate : @xmath69 when @xmath65 , we see from the tortoise coordinates transformation ( 30 ) that @xmath70 so solution ( 36 ) is reduced to @xmath71 we then extend the solution ( 39 ) to the region @xmath72 by analytic continuation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 so the overall ingoing wave could be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76is a normalization factor , and @xmath77 stands for the spectrum of radiation . because @xmath78 where +  is for fermions and  -  is for bosons , so we obtain @xmath79 @xmath80 thus we proved that the inner horizon of the kerr - newman black hole has the temperature @xmath81 , and there are particles generated by vacuum polarization erupted from the inside ( the region @xmath55 ) to the inner horizon .",
    "this makes a new kind of radiation ( or absorption[24 ] ) .",
    "the particle that arrives at the inner horizon will travel to the outer horizon and reduce its temperature to @xmath82 .",
    "the particle then goes ahead to erupt from the outer horizon , which makes the usual hawking radiation .",
    "the bekenstein - smarr equation of the black hole could be written simply as formula ( 4 ) .",
    "thus we get @xmath8 , where a is the area of outer horizon .",
    "also , the bekenstein - smarr equation could be written in anothor form : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the area of inner horizon : @xmath85 we can assume that the contribution to the entropy from the outer and inner horizon are @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively : @xmath88 so the total entropy is @xmath89 which is the same with formula ( 14 ) , and obviously , vanishes as temperature vanishes .",
    "we therefore think the entropy of the extremal kerr - newman black hole is zero and the third law of thermodynamics is still applicable in this case ."
