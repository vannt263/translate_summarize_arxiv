    "the study of dynamical phenomena has provided central advances on magnetization dynamics during the past decades .",
    "usually , the investigations are based on traditional ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) experiments , in which the sample is submitted to an intense external magnetic field , saturating it magnetically . from fmr measurements , information regarding magnetic anisotropies , damping parameter and other important parameters related to the magnetic dynamics can be reached .",
    "however , nowadays , similar information can be accessibly obtained also through the study of the magnetoimpedance effect .",
    "this effect is a versatile tool commonly employed to investigate ferromagnetic materials , revealing aspects on the fundamental physics associated to magnetization dynamics , broadband magnetic properties  @xcite , as well as on important issues for current and emerging technological applications for magnetic sensors  @xcite . besides",
    ", further insights on fmr effect at non - saturated magnetic states of the sample can be easily gotten , making possible the study of local resonances and their influence in the dynamics magnetization .    the magnetoimpedance effect ( mi )",
    "corresponds to the change of the real and imaginary components of electrical impedance of a ferromagnetic sample caused by the action of an external static magnetic field . in a typical mi experiment , the studied sample is also submitted to an alternate magnetic field associated to the electric current @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the probe current frequency .",
    "irrespective to the sample geometry , the overall effect of these magnetic fields is to induce strong modifications of the effective magnetic permeability .",
    "experimentally , studies on mi have been widely performed in sheets  @xcite , magnetic ribbons  @xcite , wires  @xcite , and in ferromagnetic films with several structures , such as single layered  @xcite , multilayered  @xcite , and structured multilayered samples  @xcite .",
    "the general theoretical approach to the mi problem focuses on its determination as a function of magnetic field for a range of frequencies .",
    "traditionally , the changes of magnetic permeability and impedance with magnetic fields at different frequency ranges are caused by three distinct mechanisms  @xcite : magnetoinductive effect , skin effect , and fmr effect .",
    "thus , mi can generally be classified into the three frequency regimes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mi behavior with magnetic field and probe current frequency becomes more complex , since it also depends on magnetic properties , such as magnetic anisotropies , as well as sample dimensions and geometry .",
    "given that distinct effects affect the magnetic permeability behavior at different frequency ranges and different properties influences the mi , the description of the magnetoimpedance effect over a wide range of frequency becomes a difficult task .",
    "for this reason , the comprehension on the theoretical and experimental point of views of the magnetoimpedance effect is fundamental for the development of new materials with optimized response .",
    "since the system geometry has an important role on mi results , several studies have been performed to obtain further information on this dependence .",
    "considerable attention have been given to describe the mi effect in samples presenting cylindrical geometry with distinct anisotropy configurations  @xcite .",
    "for this case , e. g. , makhnovskiy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have reported a very strict study on the surface impedance tensor , in which theoretical results for the cylindrical geometry are directly compared to experimental measurements acquired for ferromagnetic wires .",
    "in addition , usov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have presented theoretical and experimental results for ferromagnetic wires with weak helical anisotropy . regarding the mi effect for the case of planar systems ,",
    "an important study has been performed in single layers by kraus  @xcite , who performed the calculation of the mi effect in a single planar conductor and studied the influence of the gilbert damping constant , the angle between the anisotropy direction and the applied magnetic field on the mi effect .",
    "moreover , panina _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and sukstanskii _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the mi behavior in multilayers , analyzing the influence of width , length , and relative conductivity in mi effect .",
    "although the mi results obtained are consistent and seem to reproduce experimental data , they are restricted to a limited frequency range .",
    "since experimental measurements are usually taken over a wide range of frequencies , in which different mechanisms contributes to the permeability , a general theoretical approach to the transverse magnetic permeability which enables the mi calculation , considering frequency dependent magnetic permeability , becomes very important for mi interpretation .    in this paper , we report a theoretical and experimental investigation of the magnetoimpedance effect for the thin film geometry in a wide frequency range .",
    "first of all , we perform numerical calculations of the longitudinal magnetoimpedance for single layered , multilayered and exchange bias systems , from a classical electromagnetic impedance for a planar system . to this end",
    ", we consider a theoretical approach that takes into account a magnetic permeability model for planar geometry and the appropriate magnetic free energy density for each structure .",
    "we analyze the magnetoimpedance behavior , and discuss the main features and advantages of each structure , as well as we relate the numerical calculations with experimental results found in literature . finally ,",
    "to test the robustness of the approach , we compare theoretical results calculated for an exchange biased multilayered system with experimental magnetoimpedance measurements obtained in a wide range of frequencies for an exchange biased multilayered film .",
    "thus , we provide experimental evidence to confirm the validity of the theoretical approach to describe the magnetoimpedance in ferromagnetic films .",
    "to investigate the mi effect , we perform numerical calculations of quasi - static magnetization curves , magnetic permeability and magnetoimpedance for the thin film geometry . to this end , from the appropriate magnetic free energy density for the investigated structure , in a first moment , we consider a general magnetic susceptibility model which takes into account its dependence with both frequency and magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain the transverse magnetic permeability for planar geometry from susceptibility and in turn describe the mi behavior by using different models , according to system structure , for a wide range of frequencies and external magnetic fields .",
    "we focus on the study of ferromagnetic thin films , which can be modeled as a planar system . here , in particular , we calculate the longitudinal magnetoimpedance effect for single layered , multilayered or exchange biased systems . figure  [ fig_01](a ) presents the theoretical system and the definitions of the relevant vectors considered to perform the numerical calculations . in order to investigate the magnetoimpedance effect in films , we consider the single layered , multilayered and exchange biased systems , as respectively shown in fig .",

    "this process consists in to determine the @xmath40 and @xmath41 values that minimize the magnetic free energy density for the studied system for each external magnetic field value .",

    "although it is well - known that the changes of magnetic permeability and impedance with magnetic fields at different frequency ranges are caused by three distinct mechanisms  @xcite , the determination of the precise frequency limits between regimes is a hard task , since the overlap of contributions to mi of distinct mechanisms , such as the skin and fmr effects , is very likely to occur .",

    "usually , theoretical models that describe magnetization dynamical properties and the mi of a given system consider more than one approach to magnetic permeability .",
    "this is due to the fact that these permeability approaches reflect distinct mechanisms responsible for mi changes , applicable only for a restricted range of frequencies where the mechanism is observed .",
    "thus , the difficult task of choosing the correct magnetic permeability model to use at a certain frequency range explains the reduced number of reports comparing mi experimental results and theoretical predictions for a wide frequency range .",
