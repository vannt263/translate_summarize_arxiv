    "the nature and dynamics of dark energy  de  , which gives the accelerating expansion of the universe at present time , is now days one of the most interesting and stimulating fields of physics .",
    "it was discovered more than ten years ago @xcite and it has been confirmed by further cosmological observations , being now one of the most robust conjecture in modern physics . in fact",
    "the acceleration of the present universe has many experimental proofs such as the cmb temperature and fluctuations @xcite , in the matter power spectrum measured by galaxy surveys @xcite and in type ia supoernovae @xcite .",
    "the most popular model is the so called @xmath15cdm model , in which a cosmological constant and some amount of cold dark matter are included  by hand  .",
    "despite its extraordinary consistence with observations , @xmath15cdm is an effective model that leaves many unsolved theoretical question .",
    "in fact the existence of the cosmological constant and its order of magnitude have no theoretical justification in @xmath15cdm .",
    "the cosmological coincidence problem , that is why the universe is starting to accelerate right now , is also unsolved . introducing a cosmological constant at the initial stages of the standard cosmological model",
    "is specially troublesome since one has to fine tune its value to one parte in @xmath16 .",
    "this problem can be ameliorated if we understand when and how dark energy appears in the universe and this is the main motivation of our present work @xcite .",
    "however , our approach will also help us to unify dark energy with inflation .",
    "an attractive dark energy alternative to the @xmath15cdm model consists in introducing a  quintessence  scalar field @xmath0 that generates the accelerating expansion of the universe due to is dynamics .",
    "the dynamics is fixed by its potential @xmath8 and it is possible to choose potentials that lead to a late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "this scalar field can be a fundamental or composite particle as for example bound states . in the second case ,",
    "the bound quintessence fields are scalar fields composed of fundamental fermions , such as meson fields , and can be generated at low energies as a consequence of a low phase transition scale due to a strong gauge coupling constant .",
    "this allows to understand why de appears at such late times . on the other hand , in the former case the appearance of fundamental scalar field",
    "is right at the beginning of the reheated universe and the acceleration of the universe takes place at a much later time due to the classical evolution of the quintessence field @xmath0 .",
    "the huge difference in scales between the reheating and dark energy scales requires a fine tuning in the choice of the potential .    here ,",
    "we present an interesting alternative , namely that the emergence of the fundamental quintessence particles @xmath0 is originated from a quantum transition taking place at low energies , e.g. as low as @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the scale where this transition takes places depends on the strength of the interaction between @xmath0 and a relativistic field @xmath2 and it is dynamically determined by the ratio @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the transition rate and @xmath20 the hubble constant .",
    "a value of the coupling @xmath3 gives a generation scale @xmath21 with a cross section @xmath22 close to the wimps cross section @xmath23 at decoupling .",
    "the subsequent acceleration of the universe is due to the classical evolution of @xmath0 due to the scalar potential @xmath8 .",
    "our quantum generation scheme does not aim to derive the potential @xmath8 but to understand why dark energy dominates at such a late time . clearly , by closing the gap between the energy today @xmath24 , where the subscript @xmath25 always refers to present time quantities , and that of @xmath0 production @xmath26 , we do not require a fine tuning of the parameters in @xmath8 .",
    "since the appearance of @xmath0 may be at such low scales this offers a new interpretation and solution to the cosmological coincidence problem in terms of the size of the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , this late time production of the @xmath0 particles allows to implement in a natural way a dark energy - inflaton unification scheme . in this scenario , after inflation the field @xmath0 decays completely and reheats the universe with standard model particles .",
    "the universe expands then in a decelerating way dominated first by radiation and later by matter . at low energies the same interaction term that gives rise to the inflaton decay accounts for the quantum re - generation of the @xmath0 field giving rise to dark energy . in general , it is not complicated to choose a scalar potential such that the universe accelerates in two different regions , at early inflation and dark energy epochs , as in quintessential models .",
    "however , the universe requires to be most of the time dominated first by standard model relativistic particles and later by matter .",
    "the reheating of the universe and the long period of decelerating phase are usually not taken into account in inflation - dark energy unification models and these features are essential in the standard cosmological big bang model . in our case ,",
    "the inflaton - dark energy field is completely absent during most of the time ( from reheating until re - generation ) and therefore it does not interfere with the standard cosmological model .",
    "we will exemplify our inflation - dark energy unified scheme with a simple model .",
    "the scalar potential @xmath8 will have only two parameters fixed by the conditions to give the correct density perturbations @xmath27 and the present time dark energy scale .",
    "the two couplings @xmath28 , which give the strength of reheating process with sm particles and the @xmath0 re - generation process at low energies , respectively , are free parameters but we may take them as @xmath29 , where @xmath11 is the scale of inflation and it is one of the parameters of @xmath8 . therefore , starting with four free parameters we can reduce the number to only two and these two are fixed by observations .",
    "this gives a reheating scale @xmath30 and @xmath0-generation scale @xmath31 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ motivations ] we give an overview of the late time quantum generation of the quintessence field @xmath0 and its possible unification with the inflaton field . in section [ regeneration ] we present the dark energy quantum generation in detail . in section [ regeneration ]",
    "we show how to unify inflation and dark energy in terms of a single scalar field in the context of our dark energy quantum generation process and we present a simple model .",
    "finally , in section [ phenomenology ] we present the main phenomenological consequences of our model while in section [ conclusions ] we resume and conclude .",
    "to avoid any future confusion we state the terminology used in this work .",
    "we define as usual the energy of the universe at any given time as @xmath32 or for a @xmath33-species as @xmath34 . for particles",
    "we take their energy @xmath35 as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the momentum and mass of the @xmath38-particle .",
    "if the particles are relativistic and in thermal equilibrium then one can define a temperature @xmath39 with an energy density @xmath40 and number density @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the relativistic degrees of freedom and @xmath43 is the riemann zeta function of @xmath44 . the energy distribution of thermalized particles is strongly piked around the mean value @xmath45 with @xmath46 and we identify the energy of the particle @xmath35 with the average energy @xmath47 .",
    "we will loosely refer then to either the temperature or the energy of the ( thermalized ) relativistic particles and we will work in natural units with @xmath48 but we will reintroduce the correct energy dimensions when convenient .    we will first present the quantum generation process of dark energy field @xmath0 and we will later discuss the possibility to unify it with the inflaton field . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the main goal of this paper is to describe how the dark energy field @xmath0 may be generated at a very late time via a quantum transition process and how the scalar potential @xmath8 , responsible for the late time acceleration , is generated .",
    "once @xmath8 is produced , the classical equation of motion gives the dynamics of @xmath0 , and choosing an appropriated flat @xmath8 at low energies ensures that the universe enters an accelerating epoch close to present time .",
    "this work does not aim to derive the potential @xmath8 but to understand why dark energy dominates at such a late time .",
    "of course , by closing the gap between the energy today @xmath24 and that of @xmath0 production @xmath26 there is a no longer a fine tuning of the parameters in @xmath8 .",
    "we describe now the generation process .",
    "we take a universe filled with standard model sm particles and an extra relativistic field @xmath2 and no @xmath0 particles , i.e. @xmath49 . the @xmath2 particle is not necessarily contained in the sm ( however , an interesting possibility is to associate @xmath2 with neutrinos ) but we require that at time of @xmath0-generation @xmath50 . in the context of inflation - dark energy unification",
    "the @xmath2 must have been in thermal equilibrium with the sm and therefore @xmath51 with @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the relativistic degrees of freedom of @xmath2 and the sm respectively and @xmath55 is the density of sm relativistic particles .",
    "since we want to produce the @xmath0 particles via a quantum transition process we couple it to @xmath2 via an interaction term @xmath56 , e.g. @xmath57 or @xmath58 . in order to produce the @xmath0 particles at low energies we require that the interaction rate @xmath19 of the quantum process must be initially smaller than the hubble parameter @xmath20 and the ratio @xmath18 should increases with the expansion of the universe .",
    "this will happen if @xmath19 decreases less rapidly than @xmath20 .",
    "for example if we have a @xmath59 process of relativistic particles the transition rate scale as @xmath60 and @xmath61 giving @xmath62 , where we have taken @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath0 particles production starts then for temperatures @xmath39 below @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "the energy scale at which the @xmath0 is generated is fixed by the coupling constant @xmath1 , so the coincidence problem is explained in terms of the strength of the interactions of the @xmath0 field . in particular one can generate the @xmath0 field at low energies , e.g. @xmath65 with @xmath3 giving a fine structure constant @xmath66 and a cross section @xmath67 .",
    "the value of @xmath68 is quite close to cross section of wimp dark matter with nucleons @xmath69 .",
    "since we can choose the coupling @xmath1 in such a way that the @xmath0 is generated at low energies close to present time , this offers a new interpretation of the cosmological coincidence problem : dark energy domination starts at such small energies because of the size of the coupling constant @xmath1 . for a @xmath0-generation energy of @xmath70",
    "the ratio in energy densities from the appearance of the fundamental field @xmath0 to present time is @xmath71 and should be compared to a case where @xmath0 is present at the planck time @xmath72 with @xmath73 , giving a difference in ratios of @xmath74 orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the amount of fine tuning in the parameters of the dark energy potential @xmath8 is much less sever in our case than in a standard quintessence dark energy model .",
    "the production of the @xmath0 particles gives rise to the scalar potential @xmath8 and the field @xmath0 will then evolve classically given by its equation of motion .",
    "of course , we still need to choose @xmath8 appropriately to give dark energy , for example @xmath75 with @xmath76 the present time dark energy potential @xcite .",
    "we stress the fact that the dark energy behavior of the universe is due to the form of the potential @xmath8 but the energy @xmath26 at which the @xmath0 is generated is fixed by the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    ", with the density of @xmath0 field ( black line ) , @xmath2 field ( red dottedline ) , radiation ( yellow line ) and of matter ( blue dashed line ) against the number of e - folds @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "we see how at @xmath78 the @xmath0 field disappears and the universe is reheated . at @xmath79",
    "the @xmath0 field is re - generated and the @xmath80 field disappears .",
    "we see how the @xmath0 field is rapidly diluted and than maintains nearly constant at @xmath81 . at late times close to present time , i.e. at @xmath82 , the @xmath0 field starts to dominate and inflate the universe.,width=264 ]    an interesting possibility is to unify inflation and dark energy using the same scalar field @xmath0 in our dark energy quantum generation picture @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 has a potential @xmath8 which gives an early inflation at @xmath11 , as in standard inflationary models .",
    "in this case we use the coupling @xmath83 to allow the @xmath0 field to decay into @xmath80 particles after inflation , via the process @xmath84 .",
    "this decay process is very efficient and the @xmath0 decays completely disappearing entirely from the spectrum of the universe . in order to produce sm particles ,",
    "the @xmath80 is coupled with the sm via the standard interactions @xmath85 or @xmath86 with @xmath87 sm scalar or fermions , respectively .",
    "reheating of the early universe takes place via a @xmath88 process @xmath89 or @xmath90 with a transition rate @xmath91 , for @xmath92 at an energy scale @xmath93 . because of its couplings , the sm particles and @xmath80 are in thermal equilibrium at the time of reheating , and as long as @xmath2 remains relativistic one has @xmath94 . after reheating",
    "@xmath95 evolves as radiation and eventually it will re - generate the @xmath0 field , at an energy @xmath96",
    ". the re - generation process of @xmath0 can be produced with the same interaction @xmath83 as the inflaton decay at @xmath11 .",
    "a main difference in the transition processes at @xmath11 and at @xmath26 is the size of the mass of @xmath0 .",
    "it varies quite significantly and we should have @xmath97 and also @xmath98 . in this case the inflaton - dark energy potential @xmath8 must be chosen to be flat at high energy @xmath11 , to give inflation , and at low energy @xmath24 to accelerate the universe at present time .",
    "the reheating energy @xmath99 and the @xmath0 generation energy @xmath100 are fixed by the coupling constants @xmath10 and @xmath1 independently of the potential @xmath8 . in the model presented in section [ unification ] we set @xmath29 reducing the number of parameters and connecting the inflation scale to the @xmath0-generation and to the reheating scales , @xmath101 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , any unification of inflation and dark energy , such as quintessential models , need to explain how the universe is reheated with sm particles and must account for the long period of decelerating universe . in our model",
    "we are able to explain both features in a consistent way .",
    "we give a schematic picture of the inflation - dark energy unified model showing in fig.([figaaa ] ) the evolution of the logarithms of the energy densities of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 fields , radiation and matter .",
    "we start with a @xmath0 dominated universe and then at @xmath78 , where @xmath102 with @xmath103 the scale factor , the @xmath0 field decays and disappears , reheating the universe . after reheating the universe",
    "is radiation dominated , as in the standard cosmological model , and radiation includes the sm relativistic degrees of freedom plus the extra relativistic field @xmath80 . at @xmath79",
    "the @xmath0 field is re - generated with @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the value of @xmath106 at the end of the generation process and @xmath107 is the value of @xmath108 at the begin of the @xmath0 generation . at the same time",
    "the @xmath80 field decays and @xmath109 diminishes .",
    "after the generation , @xmath106 is rapidly diluted and subsequently maintains nearly constant at @xmath110 and it starts to dominate close to present times , i.e. at @xmath111 , inflating the universe .",
    "in this section we describe the quantum generation of the quintessence scalar field @xmath0 and the subsequent appearance of the dark energy behavior of the late universe due to the classical evolution of @xmath0 . in what follows",
    "we assume a universe that consists of the particles of the standard model ",
    "sm  together with a massless scalar field @xmath80 and a quintessence scalar field @xmath0 coupled together via a four particle interaction , as for example @xmath83 or @xmath112 . the @xmath80 field",

    "as mentioned previously , the @xmath80 field is initially thermalized and it has a phase space distribution given by the bose - einstein distribution @xmath160 , so we can take all the @xmath80 particles with the same energy @xmath161 .",
    "since the @xmath129 interaction process conserves energy the @xmath0 particles become in thermal equilibrium with @xmath2 and they has the same energy @xmath162 .",

    "before the @xmath0 generation the density number of @xmath80 particles evolves as @xmath164 , so the transition rate for the considered @xmath59 processes of relativistic particles is expressed in terms of the energy of the quantum particles as @xmath165 and therefore it scales as @xmath166 . as discussed in section [ motivations ] , in order to have a late time dark energy generation , it is fundamental to have a ratio @xmath167 that grows up with the expansion of the universe .",

    "the time when @xmath276 corresponds to the end of @xmath0 generation and to the maximum of @xmath8 .",
    "another feature of the @xmath0 generation process consists of the existence of an equilibrium value @xmath277 for the density number of @xmath0 particles @xmath7 .",
    "therefore after a first phase of growth , @xmath7 saturates at @xmath247 and then it is maintained constant .",
    "this means that all the energy coming from further @xmath80 particles decay is transferred directly into the potential @xmath8 without generate any change in @xmath7 .",
    "let us point out more properties of the @xmath0 generation process .",
    "first we note that if the @xmath0 field is regenerated when the universe is radiation dominated , the scale factor evolves as @xmath278 .",
    "the @xmath0 generation ends at @xmath279 ( see eq.([sol2 ] ) ) with @xmath280 , giving @xmath281 and @xmath282 ( the generation process has @xmath283 ) , thus we see that the expansion of the universe during the @xmath0 generation plays no significant role .",
    "we also stress the fact that the generation process preserves the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe , as in the reheating process after inflation .",
    "in fact it is obtained via a @xmath129 quantum process in which the energy - momentum is conserved ( @xmath284 ) so the amount of homogeneity is preserved .",
    "now we can state something more about the begin and the duration of the generation process . first note that at the begin of the @xmath0 generation @xmath285 , that implies @xmath286 .",
    "therefore , in order to establish the efficiency of @xmath0 particles production one should compare the transition rate @xmath170 with the expansion rate of the universe @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that before the generation the @xmath80 field has the same temperature of the radiation , so we take @xmath287 . if the generation starts before the matter domination one has @xmath288 where @xmath289 and @xmath290 is the total number of relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , using @xmath291 before the @xmath0 generation one has @xmath292 and @xmath293 , where we have defined @xmath294 .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0 generation starts at energies @xmath295 with @xmath296 when @xmath297 .",
    "we aim to have a @xmath0 particles production at energy scales well below @xmath298 , where the number of relativistic degrees of freedom is @xmath299 giving @xmath300 . of course",
    ", by means of eq.([egen ] ) we can conveniently choose the coupling @xmath1 in such a way that the generation process starts at an energy of about @xmath301 .",
    "this takes place if @xmath302 or @xmath303 , where @xmath304 is the fine structure constant of the transition process .",
    "we stress the fact that @xmath305 during the @xmath0 generation process but , when the @xmath0 field starts to inflate the universe , one has @xmath306 with @xmath307 , so @xmath20 will be roughly constant and at the dark energy epoch @xmath308 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 and @xmath80 fields decouple at @xmath309 .",
    "we can summarize the @xmath0 generation process as follows . at the begin of the generation we have @xmath310 ,",
    "@xmath311 and at @xmath312 we have @xmath313 .",
    "the first effect is the decay of @xmath2 and the growth of @xmath7 to its equilibrium value @xmath314 after which @xmath7 remains constant .",
    "subsequently all the energy coming from the @xmath80 field is transferred to the potential @xmath8 through the chain reaction @xmath315 . in this process @xmath7 remains constant and @xmath247 represent a maximum transfer efficiency value for @xmath7 in such a way that the energy coming from the decaying @xmath80 particles is immediately stored into the potential @xmath8 . at the end of the generation on has @xmath316 @xmath317 and @xmath104 .    from this point on",
    ", the evolution of @xmath0 is the standard one , where its dynamics is dominated by the classical potential @xmath8 .",
    "the generation process described before does not depend explicitly on the form of the potential @xmath8 and the value of @xmath0 at the end of the generation process is given by the condition @xmath318 .",
    "since we want the @xmath0 field to give dark energy , we must choose a potential @xmath8 that slow rolls at late times , i.e. at present time when @xmath319 .",
    "clearly we must impose the condition @xmath320 .",
    "for example one can consider an effective potential @xmath321 that verifies the slow roll conditions for @xmath322 and take @xmath323 . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath0 at the end of the generation is @xmath324 where we have used @xmath325 .",
    "typically , runaway quintessence potentials have an eos parameter @xmath326 that reaches positive values of @xmath327 diluting @xmath328 and later there is a transition from @xmath329 to @xmath330 as in fig.([figomega ] ) where @xmath328 starts growing .",

    "we present an inflation - dark energy unified scheme that can be resumed in the following way : as in usual inflationary models , the early universe is dominated by the @xmath0 field that inflates for a sufficient number of e - folds . after the end of inflation the @xmath0 field decays completely into the extra relativistic field @xmath80 already introduced in section [ regeneration ] .",

    "@xmath26 the @xmath0 field is generated via the quantum generation mechanism studied in section [ regeneration ] and the universe enters the dark energy epoch at temperatures close to present time . from @xmath354 to @xmath26",
    "we have the standard evolutionary scenario with the extra relativistic degree of freedom @xmath80 .",
    "the new feature in the unification scheme that we present here , is that the transition between decelerating radiation - matter dominate universe and the dark energy era is due to a quantum process , i.e. the low energy generation of the @xmath0 field . as stated in section [ regeneration ] , the energy scale @xmath26 at which the uniton @xmath0 is generated is fixed by the couplings @xmath1 of @xmath0 .",
    "the scales @xmath26 may be many orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath354 without any fine tuning .",

    "in addition one has to require that the @xmath0 particles are relativistic at @xmath358 , that implies @xmath359 . in section [ inflationreheating ]",
    "we will discuss the inflation and reheating scenario and then in section [ unification2 ] we will consider the inflation and dark energy unified scheme using a simple example .",
    "let us consider an universe that contains the field @xmath0 , a second scalar field @xmath80 and the sm particles .",
    "we want the @xmath0 field to inflate the early universe , so we assume that the potential @xmath8 has at least one flat region corresponding to inflation .",
    "as an example one can consider the potential described in appendix [ appendix1 ] . during inflation",
    "the @xmath0 field dominates the universe and slow rolls as long as the slow roll conditions @xmath360 and @xmath361 are satisfied and the universe inflates with @xmath362 . after the end of inflation",

    "the @xmath0 particles are at rest in the comoving frame ( the velocity is redshifted as @xmath366 ) so @xmath367 and we take @xmath368 .",

    "sm particles are produced at @xmath387 where we have defined @xmath388 and @xmath389 .",

    "let us first discuss the consequences of having the relativistic field @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath80 is not contained in the sm then it represent an extra relativistic degree of freedom .",
    "cmb temperature anisotropies as well as sdss and 2df large scale galaxy clustering , lyman-@xmath304 absorption clouds , type ia supernovae luminosity distances and bao data , can be used to determinate the value of the effective relativistic degrees of freedom , usually described in terms of the effective number of neutrinos @xmath464 .",
    "the value of @xmath464 affects the matter - radiation equality epoch and thus the isw effect , so cmb anisotropies are sensitive to deviations from the standard cosmological model value of @xmath465 .",
    "analysis of the wmap data combined with other cosmological data sets allows for values of @xmath464 different from its standard model value .",
    "for example in @xcite it is found @xmath466 at @xmath467 c.l .",
    ", consistently with other analysis @xcite . moreover bbn is also affected by @xmath464 , because the number of relativistic degrees of freedom change the value of the expansion rate of the universe and than influence the expected primordial helium abundance .",
    "the bbn bound is @xmath468 at @xmath467 c.l .",
    "@xcite , that seems to be more stringent than bounds coming from cmb data .",
    "anyhow @xmath464 can evolve from the bbn epoch at @xmath469 to the cmb decoupling era at @xmath470 @xcite , so the different bounds coming from bbn and cmb are compatible . in our case",
    "the extra relativistic degree of freedom is represented by the scalar field @xmath80 that contributes to @xmath464 an amount @xmath471 .",
    "if the @xmath80 decouples from radiation before neutrinos , one has @xmath472 and @xmath473 , that is in full agrement with both bbn and cmb data .",
    "if @xmath80 is coupled with photons one has @xmath474 that shows some tension with bbn data but is compatible with cmb data . in any case the existence of the extra relativistic degree of freedom coming from the @xmath80 field is consistent and apparently favored by cosmological data .",
    "another important phenomenological aspect of the dark energy generation model , concerns the coupling of the @xmath80 field with sm particles . in principle @xmath80",
    "may be coupled with electrons , baryons and photons , but strong limits on the strength of such couplings comes from astrophysical considerations and accelerator phyiscs .",

    "the upper bound coming from long range force experiments is @xmath479 @xcite thus the @xmath80 coupling with baryons should be excluded .",
    "if the @xmath80 field is coupled with photons via the axion - like interaction term @xmath480 with @xmath481 @xcite .",
    "the bound on the transition rate is @xmath482 .",
    "taking @xmath483 the field @xmath80 and photons are coupled for @xmath484 when @xmath485 .",

    "the coupling with photons is not ruled out by experimental data .    in conclusion , the @xmath80 field",
    "could be coupled either to neutrinos , photons , neutral higgs field or supersymmetric partners of the sm which are currently searched for at lhc . it is particularly interesting the case in witch the @xmath80",
    "is coupled with neutrinos . in the standard cosmological model the three neutrinos free - stream and",
    "interact only gravitationally .",
    "free - streaming lowers the neutrino perturbations and introduce a source of anisotropic stress . on the contrary , if one or more neutrinos are coupled with the scalar field @xmath80 , the interacting neutrinos behave as a tightly - coupled fluid with density and velocity perturbations but no anisotropy @xcite .",
    "this fact also affects the adiabatic sound speed @xmath488 , that is equal to @xmath489 for free - streaming neutrinos and it is @xmath490 for tightly - coupled neutrinos .",
    "therefore the coupling of the @xmath80 field with neutrinos produces many observable consequences on the cosmic neutrino background ( cnb ) @xcite .    in alternative to the dark energy generation scheme presented in section [ regeneration ]",
    ", one can generate the @xmath0 field without any auxiliary field @xmath80 but coupling @xmath0 directly with sm neutrinos via an interaction @xmath491 .",
    "therefore one or more neutrinos will be tightly - coupled to the @xmath0 quintessence field and this will produced observable consequences on the cnb @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 sector of the quantum generation model has also an interesting phenomenology .",
    "for example the inflation dark energy unified model presented in section [ unification ] has low inflationary and and reheating scale @xmath419 and @xmath492 for @xmath493 .",
    "this low reheating energy does not affect the reheating efficiency and it also avoids gravitino overabundance problems . from a cosmological point of view ,",
    "a low inflationary scale may also affect @xmath464 as showed in @xcite , giving one more possible test of the unified model .",
    "moreover interesting effects may be observed in accelerators , as for example at lhc , with energy scales not so far from the inflationary energy .",
    "then , as discussed above , a rich phenomenology exists , that may be used to constrain or falsify cosmological models that make use of the dark energy generation mechanism .",
    "we will now present a summary and conclusions of our work .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper was to understand why the dark energy is manifested at such a late time . to achieve this",
    "we have presented a novel idea , the quantum generation of dark energy , giving a new interpretation of the late time emergence of de in terms of a late time quantum production of the quintessence @xmath0 particles .",
    "we take a @xmath59 quantum process between @xmath0 and a relativistic @xmath2 particles .",
    "the scale where the @xmath0 field is generated is dynamically determined by the condition @xmath494 giving an energy scale @xmath495 with @xmath496 and @xmath444 .",
    "therefore the smallness of @xmath26 is due to a small coupling @xmath1 and for @xmath497 gives a @xmath498 and a cross section @xmath499 .",
    "the acceleration of the universe is then due to the classical evolution of @xmath0 and determined by the scalar potential @xmath8 .",
    "we have described in section [ regeneration ] a universe that initially contains no @xmath0 particles , i.e. @xmath500 , and once the relativistic particles @xmath0 are produced they become a source term for the generation of the scalar potential @xmath8 .",
    "once @xmath8 has been produced the classical equation of motion gives the evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "we show in section [ unification ] that it is possible to unify inflation and dark energy using the same quintessence field @xmath0 . to achieve the unification we required that the potential @xmath8 has two flat regions , at high energy for inflation and low energy for dark energy . in this scenario , after inflation the field @xmath0 decays completely and reheats the universe with standard model particles .",
    "the universe expands then in a decelerating way dominated first by radiation and later by matter . at low energies the same interaction term that gives rise to the inflaton decay accounts for the re - generation of the @xmath0 field giving rise to dark energy .",
    "an important difference in the quantum process between @xmath0 and @xmath2 at high and low energies is the value of transition rate due to the size of the @xmath0 mass , @xmath501 .",
    "we presented in section [ unification ] a simple example on how the inflation - dark energy unification can be implemented .",
    "we used a potential @xmath502)$ ] which is flat at high and low energies .",
    "the two parameters @xmath503 are determined by the density perturbations @xmath504 and the value of @xmath505 at present time giving @xmath506 .",
    "the coupling @xmath1 between @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the coupling @xmath10 between @xmath2 and the sm particles are free parameters but can be taken as @xmath507 giving a reheating energy @xmath508 and a generation energy @xmath509 .",
    "the cross section between @xmath0 and @xmath2 is @xmath510 quite close to cross section of wimp dark matter with nucleons @xmath511 at decoupling . by fixing @xmath512",
    "we have determined the coupling , which set the scales of reheating and @xmath0 re - generation , in terms of the inflation scale @xmath11 and we can reduced the number of parameters .",
    "of course this is not the only possible choice of @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "+ to conclude , we have presented a general framework to produce the fundamental quintessence field @xmath0 dynamically at low energies .",
    "the energy scale is fixed by the strength of the coupling and this offers a new interpretation of the cosmological coincidence problem : dark energy domination starts at such small energies because of the size of the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "finally , our approach allows for an easy implementation of inflation and dark energy unification with the standard long periods of radiation / matter domination .",
    "here we derive the system of differential eqs.([equation1])-([equation4 ] ) that rules the @xmath0 generation .",
    "let us consider a frw universe containing the @xmath0 field coupled with a second scalar field @xmath80 and let us write down the equations of motion of the @xmath0 and @xmath80 fields .",
    "in what follows we assume that both the @xmath0 and @xmath80 particles are relativistic .",
    "the @xmath144 field can be divided into a classical background configuration @xmath145 plus a perturbation @xmath146 corresponding to the quantum configuration of the @xmath0 field ( @xmath0 particles ) , in such a way that we can write @xmath147 .",
    "we choose @xmath144 and @xmath146 as independent variables , stressing the fact that when @xmath513 one has @xmath151 .",
    "the dynamic of the @xmath0 field is then deduced from its lagrangian density @xmath514 where @xmath515 , @xmath8 and @xmath141 are the classical potentials of the @xmath0 and @xmath80 fields respectively and @xmath516 where @xmath517 is the interaction lagrangian of the scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath80 . using @xmath518 one",
    "has @xmath519 the perturbation @xmath520 evolves as a scalar field with mass @xmath521 .",
    "the corresponding quantum operator @xmath522 has the following expression = where @xmath523 and @xmath524 are respectively the wave number and the energy of the @xmath0 particles with @xmath525 @xcite,@xcite .",

    "for example this assumption is valid if the quantum particles are thermalized . in this case",
    "the phase space distributions are the bose - einstein distributions @xmath529 and @xmath530 and one can take the energies of the @xmath0 and @xmath80 particles as the mean values @xmath531 and @xmath532 with @xmath533 . moreover , in the case that the @xmath0 and @xmath80 fields are in thermal equilibrium one has @xmath534",

    "we have then @xmath542 , where @xmath7 is the density number of @xmath0 particles .",
