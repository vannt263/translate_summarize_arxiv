    "pop iii stars form by @xmath9 cooling in the absence of a strong lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation field ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "conversely , in a cloud irradiated by an extremely strong lw radiation field , @xmath9 is completely destroyed , and cooling is suppressed . in the latter case , if the cloud is in a halo with virial temperature higher than @xmath11 , it can still collapse via atomic cooling @xcite , without experiencing major episodes of fragmentation @xcite , and an embryonic protostar can grow rapidly to a sms by subsequent accretion @xcite .",
    "the latter eventually collapses due to the post - newtonian instability , leaving a black hole with @xmath12 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this process , called `` direct '' , or `` monolithic '' collapse , leads to the formation of sms remnants that are promising candidates for being the seeds of the supermassive ( @xmath13 ) black holes ( smbhs ) observed at redshift @xmath14 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the feasibility of this scenario can be tested by comparing the observed number density of the high-@xmath15 smbhs @xmath16 with the theoretical predictions . by considering the probability distribution of the lw intensity @xmath17 around halos to quantify the intensity of external radiation .",

    "@xcite ( hereafter soi14 ) found @xmath19 for realistic young - galaxy spectra .",
    "combined with the @xmath20 probability distribution by @xcite , this gives @xmath21 , in rough agreement with the observed values .",
    "however , the predicted @xmath16 is still uncertain due to our poor knowledge of @xmath18 from insufficient modelling of the physical / chemical processes in primordial gas clouds ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and of the nature of the high - redshift sources responsible for this radiation .    in the low - density primordial gas ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath9 , the main coolant in the low temperatures regime ,",
    "is formed either via the @xmath6 channel or via the @xmath3 channel .",
    "the former begins with the formation of @xmath23 by radiative attachment , @xmath24 followed by @xmath25 formation by associative detachment @xmath26 similarly , the @xmath3 channel starts with @xmath0 formation by radiative association @xmath27 followed by the charge transfer reaction @xmath28 in each channel , the second step proceeds much faster than the first one and its rate determines the amount of h@xmath1 formation .",
    "since the rate coefficient for reaction   ( @xmath29 at 8000  k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gp98 ) is about one order of magnitude larger than that for reaction   ( @xmath30 at 8000  k ; gp98 ) , the @xmath23 channel is usually much more efficient than that involving @xmath0 .",
    "however , under a strong radiation field , both channels become irrelevant due to the destruction of the intermediaries by the @xmath6 photodetachment @xmath31 and @xmath0 photodissociation @xmath32    since the binding energy of @xmath23 ( @xmath33 ) is smaller than that of @xmath0 ( @xmath34 for the ground state ) , @xmath23 is photodestroyed more easily than @xmath0 and reaction   can become the dominant source of h@xmath1 in the primordial gas .    here , it should be noted that the @xmath3 photodissociation rate depends sensitively on the internal level population , because @xmath0 in high vibrational levels is much more vulnerable to photodissociation . as an example , the binding energy of @xmath0 in vibrational levels @xmath35 is only @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "thus , the level population of @xmath3 is determined by a complex interplay of reactions , involving formation ( reaction  [ eq:16 ] ) , collisional dissociation ( reaction  [ eq:18 ] ) , photodissociation ( reaction  [ eq:3 ] ) , collisional excitation / de - excitation and radiative de - excitation .",

    "@xmath25 formation is primarily controlled by the @xmath0 channel for redshift @xmath37100 , owing to the suppression of @xmath6 by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation ( see , e.g. , gp98 ) .",
    "however , the efficiency of the @xmath0 channel depends strongly on its level population : if @xmath0 is in the ground state , the @xmath3 channel is so efficient as to produce most of the @xmath25 molecules at a level @xmath38 . on the other hand , under local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) ,",
    "the @xmath3 channel makes only a minor contribution to @xmath25 , whose final abundance remains limited to @xmath39 .",

    "[ fig : poph2p ] , instead , we also plot the lte populations with the temperature given by @xmath52 in the non - lte model ( i.e. , the solid red curve in fig.2 ) along with the results for the non - lte model , because the difference in @xmath52 in the non - lte and lte models makes it difficult to extract the effect of non - lte chemistry by directly comparing the populations in these models .",
    "the results for the lte model agree well with those in soi14 , the differences being due to the updated chemical network .",
    "below , we describe the time ( or , equivalently , density ) evolution of the cloud with particular attention to the @xmath3 vibrational level population .      in this density range , the temperature is still very low , @xmath103 , although it rises with density by adiabatic compression , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nt ] . thus , almost all @xmath3 is in the ground vibrational state if lte is assumed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : poph2p ] ) .",
    "however , in the non - lte model a finite amount of @xmath3 is in higher vibrational levels because the @xmath3 molecules tend to be formed by radiative association in excited states ( reaction  [ eq:18 ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is more pronounced at low temperatures where the @xmath104 level is more populated than the @xmath105 and @xmath106 levels .",
    "note that not all the @xmath3 settles to the ground state even though the collisional excitation / de - excitation rate is much smaller than the radiative de - excitation rate in this low - density regime .",
    "this is because not only radiative de - excitation , but also radiative association and @xmath3 photodissociation contribute to the @xmath3 level population . in the non - lte model , since a fraction of @xmath3 is in high vibrational levels , the larger @xmath3 photodissociation reaction rate results in a smaller @xmath3 abundance than in the lte or ground - state models ( fig .",

    "the amount of @xmath25 formed is smaller in the non - lte case . however , in this density range , the @xmath25 abundance is very low , @xmath107 , in all models and does not affect the thermal evolution .      in this density regime ,",
    "the evolutionary paths bifurcate into those of atomic and @xmath25 cooling depending on the assumed level population ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nt ] ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : poph2p ] , at high temperature ( @xmath109 4000k ) , in the lte approximation the excited levels are somewhat populated around @xmath110 .",
    "however , in the non - lte treatment only a smaller amount of @xmath3 resides in excited states , because of the higher photodissociation rate from those levels . in lte",
    "the fractional abundance of excited levels , and thus the @xmath3 photodissociation rate are overestimated .",
    "this results in smaller amounts of both @xmath3 and @xmath25 , compared to the non - lte model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nfrac ] ) . due to the lower h@xmath1 fraction of the lte case , the cloud collapses along the atomic cooling track ,",
    "whereas in non - lte it follows the molecular hydrogen cooling path ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nt ] ) . finally , in the ground - state model , the smaller @xmath3 photodissociation rate and the consequent larger amount of @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nfrac ] ) cause an earlier onset of @xmath25 cooling relative to the non - lte case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nt ] ) .",
    "the different evolutionary paths found in the previous regime are not modified at higher densities by the details of the various chemical processes .",
    "considering the large temperature difference between lte and the other models , it is not possible to distinguish between the effects of the level population and those related to the chemical abundances shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfrac ] . in this regime , unlike the lte population , the excited levels are more populated than the ground state , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : poph2p ] .",
    "the reason is as follows : due to the high density , the @xmath3 photodissociation is negligible compared to collisional processes , such as radiative association , charge transfer and collisional excitation / de - excitation . since not only collisional excitation / de - excitation , but also radiative association and charge transfer continue to play important roles , the level population does not converge to the lte value .",
    "this effect can be considered as a pumping mechanism that depletes the ground level and allows for the occupation of higher excited states .       as a function of the black - body temperature @xmath2 of the irradiation radiation .",

    "in addition to our fiducial result for the non - lte model , those for the ground - state and lte models are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jcrit ] for comparison .",
    "two features in fig .  [",

    "we will discuss the condition for the @xmath3 channel to be dominant in sec .",
    "[ sec : influence ] .",
    "second , in the range @xmath4 , @xmath18 depends on the assumed @xmath3 vibrational populations .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to take into account the non - lte @xmath0 level population to obtain @xmath18 correctly because the efficiency of the @xmath3 channel , the dominant @xmath25 formation channel in this range , is sensitive to its vibrational level population .",
    "compared to the correct @xmath18 by the non - lte modelling , those for the ground - state and lte models are smaller or larger , respectively .",
    "this is because in the ground - state model ( the lte model ) , compared to the non - lte model , the @xmath3 photodissociation rate is lower ( higher ) around the density where the bifurcation into the two evolutionary paths occurs , and thus more ( less ) @xmath17 is needed to suppress the @xmath25 cooling .    on the other hand , @xmath18 for @xmath114",
    "is insensitive to the @xmath3 level population because the @xmath23 channel rather than the @xmath3 channel is important in this range to determine @xmath18 .",

    "[ sec : evolution ] . on the other hand , in the hard - spectrum regime of @xmath5 , where @xmath143 , the cases a , b and d are allowed : there is no range of @xmath17 satisfying @xmath144 .",
    "namely , radiation fields strong enough to block the @xmath6 channel always exceed the critical intensity to totally suppress @xmath25 formation by @xmath25 photodissociation .",
    "this means that the h@xmath1-cooling track can not be realized by the @xmath0 channel for @xmath5 .",
    "we have computed the thermal and chemical evolution of primordial gas clouds resolving the vibrational levels of @xmath3 , which enables us to properly implement @xmath25 formation via the @xmath3 channel .",
    "the efficiency of @xmath3 photodissociation , which suppresses the @xmath3 channel by destroying the intermediate product @xmath3 , is sensitive to the level population of the molecular ion .",
    "we have found that h@xmath1 formation via the @xmath3 channel becomes more effective in the non - lte model than in lte because more @xmath3 is in the ground state and thus its photodissociation rate is smaller . as to the effects of the background radiation",
    ", we have found that @xmath25 formation via the @xmath3 channel becomes important in clouds irradiated by strong radiation fields with soft spectra characterised by @xmath145 . in this case , the cloud thermal evolution is strongly affected by the @xmath3 level population , indicating the importance of non - lte treatment of the @xmath0 vibrational levels . on the other hand , under radiation fields with harder spectra and @xmath114 , the @xmath3 channel always falls short of the @xmath6 channel in producing h@xmath1 molecules .",
    "we have derived the critical radiation intensity @xmath18 for the formation of supermassive stars by direct collapse and examined its dependence on the assumed @xmath3 level population . for soft spectra with @xmath4 , the critical intensity @xmath18 is under(over)-estimated if the level population is assumed to be in lte ( if all the @xmath3 is assumed to be in the ground state ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath18 is independent of the assumed @xmath3 level population for harder spectra with @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , since typical high - redshift radiation sources , i.e. , young and/or metal - poor galaxies , have rather hard spectra corresponding to black - bodies with @xmath146 ( soi14 ) , the lte approximation adopted in soi14 in determining @xmath18 for realistic spectra is justified .",
    "we note that primordial gas clouds may be exposed to much softer radiation fields .",
    "for example , galaxies with extremely strong ly-@xmath58 emission can be regarded as characterised by very soft spectra .",
    "since the energy of ly-@xmath58 photons ( @xmath147 ) is below the lower limit of the lyman - werner bands ( @xmath10 ) , such emission would only destroy @xmath6 leaving @xmath25 unaffected .",
    "also , since the initial mass function in high - redshift galaxies is poorly constrained , the infrared / optical cosmic background radiation originating from these sources can be soft with temperature @xmath148 , corresponding to the typical stellar mass @xmath149 , as considered in @xcite .    in non - standard cosmology",
    "primordial density fluctuations are expected to be enhanced at small scales , so that the first stellar objects can form at very early times with @xmath150 , as considered in @xcite . under the strong and very soft cmb radiation at that time",
    "( @xmath151 ) , h@xmath1 formation via the @xmath40 channel can be the dominant path with the @xmath6 channel blocked by radiation processes ( including non - thermal photons that play an additional role in enhancing h@xmath152 photodetachment ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as a last example ,",
    "let us consider the case where direct collapse via the atomic - cooling track is realized .",
    "in such a case , the growing protostar results in a very extended structure with radius @xmath153 ( `` super - giant '' protostar ) and low effective temperature @xmath154 @xcite . in studying the physical conditions in the region around the super - giant protostar",
    ", the non - lte @xmath3 level population must be taken into account .    in this paper , the collapse of primordial gas clouds has been calculated by resolving the @xmath3 vibrational levels , to our knowledge , for the first time . however , neither @xmath3 rotational levels nor @xmath25 rovibrational levels have been explicitly included .",
    "although the @xmath0 rotationally - resolved kinetics is probably not important , the @xmath9 rovibrationally - resolved kinetics may have considerable effects .",
    "the @xmath9 rovibrational level population affects critical processes in the evolution of the primordial gas , such as photodissociation , collisional dissociation , and cooling by molecular hydrogen .",
