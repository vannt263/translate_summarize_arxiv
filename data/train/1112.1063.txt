    "the cholesteric ( ch ) mesophase is locally very similar to the nematic ( n ) phase except that it is composed of optically active molecules .",
    "when optically active material form a nematic phase , the preferred direction of the long - molecular axis varies in a direction throughout the medium in a regular way and displays a continuous twist along the optic axis leading to a helical structure .",
    "thus the cholesteric phase is a distorted nematic phase .",
    "while the research on the isotropic - nematic ( i - n ) phase transition has been going on over the past few decades , there is also increasing interest in the isotropic - cholesteric ( i - ch ) transition @xcite .",
    "de gennes @xcite studied the pretransitional effect in the isotropic phase of cholesterics .",
    "he pointed out that the pretransitional effect in the isotropic phase emerges due to the presence of chiral aggregates .",
    "the i - ch transition is believed to be first order @xcite . in the isotropic phase of cholesterics",
    "the chirality exists only over a short temperature range @xcite .",
    "brazovskii et al @xcite predict a first order transition to the spiral phase , occurring in a region of substantial manifestation of critical anomalies due to the effect of critical fluctuations .",
    "longa et al @xcite studied the phase diagrams of cholesteric liquid crystal with a generalized landau - de gennes theory .",
    "muralidhar et al @xcite measured the ultrasonic absorption both in the cholesteric and isotropic phases as a function of both temperature and frequency .",
    "they observed the anomalous behavior of the absorption in both the phases .",
    "seidin et al @xcite studied the mean field phase diagram of a bulk cholesteric liquid crystal subjected to an externally applied field .",
    "the quantitative characteristic of the i - ch transition delivered a series of linear and nonlinear dielectric permittivity investigations in chiral isopentylcyanobiphenyl ( 5*cb ) carried out by rzoska and co - workers @xcite .",
    "they measured the pressure dependence of the non - linear dielectric effect ( @xmath0 ) in the isotropic phase .",
    "it was found that @xmath0 decreased strongly towards negative values on pressuring .",
    "this unusual behavior is opposite to the i - n and isotropic - smectic - a ( i - sma ) transitions @xcite .",
    "further it was observed that for the lower measurement frequency the @xmath0 strongly increases in the direction of positive values on approaching the i - ch transition . for higher measurement frequencies the negative - sign pretransitional anomaly in the isotropic phase occurs . the clear evidence for the pretransitional behavior of the @xmath0 in the isotropic phase of the i - ch transition was observed .",
    "thus the i - ch phase transition is associated with a pronounced pretransitional @xmath0 since the aligning electric field @xmath1 couples to the critical fluctuations .",
    "the pressure study on the @xmath0 suggests that the same critical - like behavior with exponent @xmath2 occurs for the i - ch transition similar to the i - n and i - sma transitions .    in spite of these experimental and theoretical efforts ,",
    "there remains still number of key questions concerning the properties of the i - ch transition .",
    "in particular , the natural supercooling of the isotropic phase and the anomalies in the temperature and pressure dependence of the precritical scattering of light and the @xmath0 require deeper investigation . it is worthwhile here to point out that the landau theories described above are able to explain some of the main experimental observations at ambient pressure .",
    "there is no such theoretical study on the pressure effect on the i - ch transition .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the pressure effect on the i - ch transition .",
    "we calculate the pressure and frequency dependence of the @xmath0 in the isotropic phase above the i - ch phase transition .",
    "the model gives a correct description of the qualitative nature of the positive and negative pretransitional behavior of the @xmath0 in the isotropic phase of the i - ch transition .",
    "in this section we consider the landau - de gennes theory of cholesteric liquid crystals .",
