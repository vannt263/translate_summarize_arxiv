    "about 10% of quasars possess powerful relativistic radio jets ( known generically as radio loud quasars rlqs ) .",
    "it is not clear if there are any differences between the accretion states of the central engines ( accretion flow plus central supermassive black hole ) in rlqs and radio quiet quasars ( rqqs ) that are defined by `` weak '' jet power .",
    ", is usually defined as a 5 ghz flux density at least 10 times larger than the @xmath2 flux density , @xmath3 with @xmath4 being a crude indication of a powerful radio jet @xcite . ]",
    "the signature of the quasar phenomenon is the thermal continuum luminosity created by dissipation in the accretion flow that results in a large blue / uv excess in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the most prominent feature of quasar optical / uv spectra are the conspicuous broad emission lines ( bels ) . to first order , the continuum and bels in rlqs and rqqs are remarkably similar @xcite .",
    "systematic differences in the two families of spectra are only revealed by the study of subtle lower order spectral features @xcite .",
    "the differences are so small that it is not clear if these features result from a difference in environment , or directly from emission induced ( or suppressed ) by the jet proper or actually a difference related to the accretion flow . in this paper , we concentrate on the properties of the civ bel in hopes of shedding light on the connection between radio jet propagation and the accretion state .",
    "the asymmetry of the civ bel has received significant attention in the past .",
    "most efforts have been concentrated on the blueshift seen in predominantly radio quiet samples ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there is also a more limited discussion of redward asymmetry in radio loud quasars @xcite .",
    "not only is this topic of fundamental interest to the study of the quasar central engines , but more recently it has become a point of controversy in the field of central black hole mass estimates based on the assumption of the bel gas being virialized in a gravitational potential @xcite . for high redshift sources ,",
    "civ is one of the available bels that can be used to estimate these virialized motions @xcite .",
    "so an important question is whether the gas that creates the emission in the asymmetric broad redwings represents virialized gas or some other gas flow that is driven by other forces .",
    "this study is motivated by a few anecdotal comments indicating that very large redward asymmetries are found in the civ bel of some highly superluminal blazars @xcite .",
    "it is of profound physical importance to determine whether these quasars are bizarre outliers or an extension of a trend within the quasar population",
    ". if they are an extension of a trend within the parent population then they are crucial evidence in the search for the source of the redward asymmetry .",
    "we explore this aspect through a large dataset , the hst spectra from the evans and koratkar atlas of hubble space telescope faint object spectrograph spectra of active galactic nuclei and quasars @xcite .    the history of the topic of the red and blue asymmetries in the civ bel of quasars is varied . here",
    "we list some of the known results .    1 .   in @xcite",
    "a high redshift sample was used to show the civ bels in steep spectrum radio loud quasars ( ssqs ) were more redward asymmetric than those in flat spectrum radio loud quasars ( fsqs ) .",
    "2 .   in @xcite",
    "there was a brief comment that core dominated quasars ( cdqs ) in a small sample of rlqs have larger civ redward asymmetries , contrary to result 1 .",
    "3 .   in @xcite",
    "it was found that the civ redward asymmetry in quasars was correlated with the uv continuum luminosity .",
    "4 .   in @xcite",
    "it was noted that most redward asymmetric objects are rlqs and he notes that the correlation with luminosity seen in @xcite might be a false correlation that arises because the highest luminosity objects in that sample tended to be radio loud .",
    "5 .   based on composite spectra from a large sample of sdss spectra",
    ", @xcite showed that rlqs have more redward emission in the civ bel relative to line center than rqq quasars .",
    "using archived hst spectra , @xcite showed that the composite civ spectrum of rlqs showed a red excess relative the rqq composite spectrum .",
    "it was mentioned in @xcite that highly superluminal blazars ( apparent velocity @xmath5 10c ) showed redward asymmetry in the civ bel profile .",
    "8 .   in @xcite",
    "it was found that the civ properties of rlqs showed a larger statistical spread than those for rqqs , including the asymmetry .",
    "9 .   in @xcite",
    "a blueward asymmetry was found in samples dominated by rqqs . in @xcite , it was determined that the blueward asymmetry of their sample did not seem to correlate with any other spectral properties .    in this letter , based on an analysis of a large sample of hst spectra , a synthesis of most of the disparate claims noted above is achieved .",
    "a sample of 886 spectra from 221 sources are catalogued in evans and koratkar atlas of hubble space telescope faint object spectrograph spectra of active galactic nuclei and quasars @xcite .",
    "this sample was used to measure the redward asymmetry in civ bels .",
    "the formula that was used by @xcite was chosen to quantify this asymmetry , @xmath6 , since we want to make contact with their subsample of `` cleaner '' hst spectra that were produced from meticulous calibration and careful continuum and line fitting .",
    "the reader is referred @xcite in order to find the details of how the raw data was processed .",
    "vs @xmath7 .",
    "there is a strong correlation within the total sample and also within the radio loud subsample.,width=170 ]    the quantity , @xmath6 , is defined in terms of the full width half maximum , fwhm , in @xmath0 , the midpoint of an imaginary line connecting a point defined at 1/4 of the peak flux density of the bel on the red side of the bel to 1/4 of the peak flux density on the blue side of the bel , @xmath8 , and a similar midpoint defined at 8/10 of the flux density maximum , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 a positive value of @xmath6 means that there is excess flux in the red broad wing of the bel .",
    "a negative value of @xmath6 indicates a blueward asymmetry of the bel . in order to get a reliable measure of @xmath6",
    ", one needs sufficient signal to noise to make a meaningful measurement of @xmath8 .",
    "also , there must not be deep intrinsic absorption features located in the bel that inhibit the measurement of any of the quantities in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the number of broad line objects in the atlas with an observed civ profile that also meet our minimum standards required to measure @xmath6 is only 95 out of the 221 sources in @xcite .",
    "we used the hst spectral data downloaded from mast except in the cases where higher quality spectra already existed in @xcite .",
    "the continuum level was set with a local power law fit between @xmath5 1470 @xmath0 and @xmath5 1620 @xmath0 .",
    "figure 1 is a plot of @xmath6 versus the spectral index from 10 ghz to 1350 @xmath0 in the quasar rest frame , @xmath7 ( where , the flux density two point spectral index is defined by the convention @xmath11 ) .",
    "the luminosity at 1350 @xmath0 is always available when civ is being observed and it is a common measure of the uv continuum near the peak of the spectral energy distribution that is utilized in virial black hole mass estimates @xcite . the radio data is compiled from the nasa extragalactic database , the first and nvss 1.4 ghz surveys and the gb and pmnj 5 ghz surveys .",
    "the physical interpretation of the two point spectral index is closely related to the logarithmic ratio of core radio flux to continuum optical / uv flux that has been proposed as an `` improved orientation indicator , '' for rlqs . for the details of the justification of this claim ( for @xmath12 , which is the ratio of 5 ghz flux density of the core to the optical flux density )",
    "please see @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the core radio flux is from a highly doppler enhanced relativistic jet and its value is very sensitive to the line of sight to the jet @xcite .",
    "conversely , the optical emission represents the ( almost ) isotropic thermal emission from the accretion flow .",
    "comparison of the two is a crude indicator of the angle that the line of sight makes to the radio jet @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath12 can not be used directly since high resolution radio images are not available for many of the sources in the sample , so the core flux density is not known .",
    "the two point spectral index , @xmath7 , uses high frequency radio flux as a surrogate for core flux density .",
    "since large scale radio flux is optically thin , steep spectrum emission and the unresolved radio core is often flat spectrum , the contribution of the core emission to the total flux density increases rapidly as the observing frequency increases .",
    "the higher the radio frequency that is used , the more accurate this surrogate will be .",
    "however , since many of the radio quiet sources had measurements only at 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz , an extrapolation of the spectrum above 10 ghz in the rest frame is not justified . the use of the 10 ghz flux density surrogate makes the interpretation of @xmath7 as an orientation indicator for rlqs inferior to @xmath12 for ssqs since the lobe flux density can still dominate the core flux density at 10 ghz in some lobe dominated quasars with very weak cores .",
    "however , in some ways this broadband spectral index might be considered an improvement on the orientation indicator , @xmath12 , since it implements the far uv flux density rather than the optical flux density , especially when considering blazars and fsqs .",
    "the amount of dilution of the observed , isotropic , thermal spectrum emitted by the quasar accretion flow by the steep spectrum , high frequency tail of the jet synchrotron emission dies off rapidly as the frequency increases .",
    "thus , for most broad line blazars with a strong nonthermal optical component , the far uv luminosity is dominated by the thermal component and is representative of the accretion flow luminosity @xcite . for those objects where the thermal component is small and",
    "the synchrotron component is huge , the far uv luminosity can still be dominated by the nonthermal jet emission , but the inaccuracy of this estimate of the thermal component is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the same estimate in the optical band .",
    "it is desirable to verify the interpretation of @xmath7 as an orientation indicator for rlqs .",
    "the fundamental consistency check of interpreting @xmath7 as an orientation indicator is that ssqs should have lower values ( weaker cores ) than fsqs since they are believed to be viewed with a line of sight more inclined from the jet axis than fsqs @xcite .",
    "a k - s test indicates that fsqs have larger values of @xmath7 ( mean of @xmath13 ) than ssqs ( mean of @xmath14 ) at the 99.5% significance level .",
    "similarly , a wilcoxon rank sum test indicates that the ranks of the @xmath7 values for fsqs are larger than the ranks of the @xmath7 values for ssqs at the 99.8% significance level .",
    "these statistical tests lend credence to the orientation indicator interpretation of @xmath6 for rlqs .",
    "the errors in @xmath6 in figure 1 arise primarily from the uncertainty in @xmath8 since the signal to noise ratio is the smallest in the broad wings .",
    "the error in each quantity in equation ( 1 ) was individually estimated and the results were added in quadrature . the error in @xmath8 , for example , was achieved by approximating the region near the 1/4 maximum point of the line profile by a local polynomial fit .",
    "the error in @xmath8 was the determined to be slope of this polynomial ( @xmath15 ) at the 1/4 maximum point times the rms noise level .",
    "this naturally produces larger errors in @xmath6 for sources with very broad wings , i.e. , the more horizontal the spectrum in the wings , the larger the slope ( @xmath15 ) will be .",
    "the error bars in figure 1 are very conservative estimates of the 1 sigma errors in the sense that these errors would be greatly reduced by smoothing the data .",
    "the polynomial fit to the noisy data minimizes residuals , so it should also be close to a fit that would minimize residuals in smoothed wings as well , but the rms noise ( the driver of the large errors in figure 1 ) would be considerably less . the errors in @xmath7 arise primarily from uncertainty in the 10 ghz flux density from either variability ( blazars ) or lack of high frequency data ( rqqs ) .",
    "the sample plotted in figure 1 includes 28 rqqs , 27 ssqs defined by a spectral index greater than 0.5 ( based on the convention @xmath16 ) from 2.7 ghz to 5 ghz ( or 1.4 ghz to 5 ghz if 2.7 ghz data was not available ) and 40 fsqs ( which will be used interchangeably with the term blazar in the following ) .",
    "the sample decomposition in figure 1 also segregates out the blazars that are known fermi or egret gamma ray loud sources @xcite .",
    "although the gamma ray loud subsample of fsqs is too small for meaningful statistical analysis , it is an intriguing subsample because these sources tend to have higher apparent superluminal velocities as measured by vlbi than other fsqs and this has been interpreted as a more polar line of sight to the jet @xcite .    as a check of our measurement technique we note that previously published @xmath6 estimates in @xcite for roughly half the sources in our sample are within the error bars that are shown in figure 1 .",
    "thus , we do not expect that there are any significant systematic differences between the measurement techniques employed here and those of other research teams for the remaining sources in figure 1 that have not been previously published .",
    "note that @xcite subtract out a narrow line component to compute asymmetry of the broad component , so it is difficult to make a quantitative comparison to the data presented here .",

    "we do not see any significant correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath40 as claimed in @xcite .",
    "the strength of various correlations ( computed by means of the spearman rank correlation coefficient ) with @xmath6 are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient , @xmath18 , is listed adjacent to the probability of the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the parameters , labeled `` p(null ) . ''",
    "the correlation of @xmath6 with @xmath7 is statistically significant in the total sample and in the radio loud subsample .",
    "the lack of a statistically significant correlation within the ssq subsample is likely due to considerable masking of the core flux density by the often dominant steep spectrum lobe flux at 10 ghz ( eg . ,",
    "p(null ) is reduced to 0.089 if 50 ghz flux density is used as a surrogate instead of 10 ghz ) . since there is a large proportion of upper limits on @xmath7 ( @xmath5 1/3 ) in the rqq subsample",
    "there is no rigorous way of performing a correlation analysis . in order to deal with this ,",
    "the correlation was computed by means of three distinct models of the data .",
    "the first choice in table 1 was the correlation with all 28 sources in row 5 using the upper limits on the 10 ghz flux density as an approximation to the measured values .",
    "secondly , the uncertainty associated with these upper limits was removed by just considering the 18 sources without upper limits in row 6 . in row 7 , it was assumed that the radio flux density was half of the upper limit .",
    "all three models of the rqq data showed no evidence of a correlation of @xmath6 with other parameters .",
    "thus , it is concluded that table 1 indicates no evidence of a statistically significant spearman rank correlation within the rqq subpopulation .",
    "since the rqqs are randomly clustered in a disjoint region of figure 1 , in the same general direction as the rlq linear fit ( extrapolating toward the lower left corner ) , they statistically act as one very heavily weighted point at the far end of the correlation , thereby enhancing the statistical significance of the correlation within the total sample in table 1 .",
    "in the previous section , the correlation between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 was established on a statistical basis in table 1 .",
    "there is a vast literature on blueward asymmetries in the civ in rqqs .",
    "by contrast , this analysis has been directed towards redward asymmetry . in this section",
    "we incorporate previous discussions of blueward asymmetry into this correlation analysis .",
    "it is shown that there are two disjoint pieces of information contained within the scatter of the data in figure 1 .",
    "first , we consider the distributions of asymmetry in figure 3 for each quasar subclass represented in table 1 .",
    "there is a clear distinction in the asymmetry of the rqqs with that of the rlqs as well as with the radio loud sub - populations fsq and ssq , individually , as evidenced by a k - s test .",
    "the maximum difference d and the k - s probability that the pairs of samples are drawn from the same population are listed in table 2 .",
    "cccc    ' '' ''    sample 1/number & sample 2/number & maximum difference , d & probability +    ' '' ''    rqq/28 & rlq/67 & 0.5917 & @xmath41 + rqq/28 & fsq/40 & 0.6607 & @xmath41 + rqq/28 & ssq/27 & 0.4907 & 0.002 + fsq/40 & ssq/27 & 0.2718 & 0.138 +    ' '' ''    the k - s test results in table 2 indicate that @xmath6 is a measurable difference between rlqs and rqqs with high statistical significance .",
    "this bimodality is mirrored in the radio sector , these sources are bimodal in the power of the radio jet .",
    "the bimodality is manifest in figure 1 as rqqs have @xmath42 and rlqs have @xmath43 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation for the rqqs in table 1 strongly supports the notion that there is no correlation between @xmath6 and other parameters .",
    "this might be expected since @xcite found that the asymmetry did not correlate with any other measured property in a sample of predominantly radio quiet quasars .",
    "the lack of signs of correlation in the rqqs and the strong correlation of the rlqs with @xmath7 in table 1 is another aspect of the bimodality of the two populations noted in the previous subsection . in terms of the correlation in figure 1 , the rqqs are essentially objects with virtually no 10 ghz flux density to first order and they are therefore clustered in the far left hand bottom corner of the scatter plot .",
    "this clustering in the lower left hand bottom corner is most naturally explained by the fact that * redward asymmetry in the civ bel profile is associated with the presence of a radio jet * , a feature that is weak in rqqs by definition .",
    "consider the vast literature demonstrating a blueward asymmetry in rqq civ bels @xcite .",
    "our data in figure 3 agrees with this notion , the distribution of @xmath6 for rqq is heavily skewed towards negative values .",
    "the physics of the radio quiet quasar phenomenon typically induces a blueward asymmetry ( through an unknown mechanism ) .",
    "the physics creating radio quiet quasars is generally believed to be the thermal luminosity resulting from dissipation in an accretion flow onto a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this standard model , the bels represent reprocessed thermal emission in gas that is photo - ionized by the accretion flow emissivity .",
    "it follows that the blueward asymmetry of the civ bels is empirically determined to arise in the combined dynamical system of the accretion flow , the resultant radiation field and the broad emission line gas .",
    "it has been suggested that the blue excess in the civ bel is evidence of an outflowing wind from the accretion disk in rqqs @xcite .",
    "now consider the dynamical environment of rlqs , for which there are two central engines .",
    "the first one is associated with the accretion flow and its powerful thermal radiation , i.e. , the same as the rqqs .",
    "in addition there is a second central engine with similar power that drives a radio jet .",
    "the accretion disk is associated with an excess of civ bel gas that is blueshifted relative to the civ peak . based on the correlations in table 1 and figure 1 ,",
    "the radio jet central engine is associated with an excess of civ bel gas that is redshifted relative to the civ peak .",
    "a rlq has both central engines and there are competing effects .",
    "the first is related to the accretion disk and has a propensity to be associated excess blueshifted emission in the civ bel .",
    "the other is related to the radio jet and is associated with excess redshifted emission in the civ bel .",
    "this has been demonstrated empirically , so we do nt know the exact mechanism which causes the accretion disk ( radio jet ) to produce blueshifted ( redshifted ) civ emission .",
    "these are competing effects that can show up in different relative strengths in principle .",
    "the statistical evidence in table 1 that there are competing affects is that @xmath6 is more strongly correlated with the logarithmic ratio of the radio luminosity ( loosely associated with jet power ) to the uv luminosity ( accretion induced thermal luminosity ) than to either of the luminosities ( uv or 10 ghz ) in rlqs .",
    "it is the relative strength of the jet to the accretion disk , not just the strength of the jet that produces the strongest correlation . physically speaking",
    ", each central engine can be extant with a wide spread of strength independent of the other central engine s strength and by some mechanism each induces broad wing emission in the bel gas that exists in a myriad of possible enveloping environments - this is undoubtedly a complicated dynamical system .",
    "this is very different than what is the case for rqqs .",
    "the extra degree of freedom for creating emission in the civ broad wings should result in * both blue asymmetries and red asymmetries in rlq civ bels * and * much larger cosmic scatter in the rlq asymmetry properties than for rqqs*. evidence for the first of these conditions is indicated by the distribution of @xmath6 in the rlq histogram in figure 3 .",
    "the second condition is supported by the comparison of the histograms for rqqs and rlqs in figure 3 , the rlq distribution is much wider .",
    "the scatter of the data is consistent with two competing sources of bel wing gas .",
    "we can test this idea of two competing effects by looking at the two outliers in detail .",
    "the fsq pg 1718 + 481 with @xmath44 and the rqq e1821 + 643 with @xmath45 .",
    "if the interpretation given is correct , then there should be evidence that pg 1718 + 481 has strong accretion disk radiation and e1821 + 643 has a powerful jet .",
    "the primary indicator that a luminous accretion flow ( a quasar ) is present in a galactic nucleus is the detection of a large uv peak in the spectral energy distribution @xcite .",
    "thus , this first prediction seems to be verified by the fact that @xmath46 for pg 1718 + 481 , by far the largest value in figure 2 .",
    "this large uv flux accounts for the small value of @xmath47 , one of the lowest in the rlq sample .",
    "the continuum flux is almost certainly from the accretion disk and not the high frequency tail of the synchrotron emission from the jet based on the following four facts .",
    "first , the spectral index is too flat from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , @xmath50 to be a blazar synchrotron emission and the ews of the bels are too large for the continuum to be dominated by synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "also , the nasa extragalactic database notes that it is not optically variable and the optical polarization is low , both inconsistent with a synchrotron interpretation of the continuum . within the two component model ,",
    "the accretion disk luminosity is so strong the it induces ( through a yet to be determined physical process ) a large blueward excess which swamps any redwing contributions induced by the relativistic jet ( through a yet to be determined process ) .    the case for e1821 + 643 is not as strong , but still highly compelling .",
    "this quasar is a powerful radio source with a 151 mhz luminosity intermediate between that of a very strong fr i and an fr ii radio source @xcite .",
    "physically , the 151 mhz luminosity is believed to be a measure of the long term time averaged kinetic power delivered by the jet to the distant radio lobes @xcite .",
    "the methods of @xcite indicate a jet kinetic luminosity of @xmath51 ergs / s .",
    "vla observations indicate that the source is core dominated and flat spectrum @xcite .",
    "the core spectrum is highly inverted between 5 ghz and 15 ghz with @xmath52 with a 15 ghz flux density of 25 mjy @xcite .",
    "the peak of the spectral energy distribution of the core is unknown .",
    "vlba observations show that the core size is less than 1 pc which bounds the brightness temperature @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the flat spectrum nature of the jet and its large high frequency luminosity are consistent with a powerful jet viewed close to the line of sight .",
    "the very large high frequency flux of the core might be indicative of a current episode of increased jet power .",
    "within the two component model described above , the dominant flat spectrum core is the manifestation of a powerful fr ii jet viewed near the line of sight .",
    "this dynamics and geometry of the current episode of jet ejection are inducing a redward asymmetry that swamps the blueward asymmetry produced by the powerful accretion disk .",
    "it is interesting that the outlier , e1821 + 643 , in the scatter plot in figure 1 is also a well studied outlier in the quasar literature . despite the radio characteristics just described it is formally radio quiet ( with @xmath54 ) per the standard definition of radio loudness in the footnote on the first page of this letter @xcite .",
    "the reason that it is always classified as radio quiet in spite of a powerful radio jet is that the optical / uv luminosity is extremely large , @xmath55 ( see figure 2 ) , making it one of the most luminous quasars at @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this circumstance results in e1821 + 643 lying within the range ( at the high end ) of @xmath7 of the rqqs in figure 1 , @xmath57 , even though it has a powerful jet .",
    "it is a rare case of a quasar that lies in a giant elliptical galaxy at the center of a cluster , but is not a rlq @xcite .",
    "this object has observational properties that are typical of both rqqs and rlqs , hence it has properties typical of both rlqs ( large @xmath6 ) and rqqs ( small @xmath7 ) in the scatter plot in figure 1 .",
    "a major advantage of the use of @xmath7 in the analysis in this letter is that is independent of the classification of a quasar as a rlq or a rqq .",
    "in this letter , we analyzed the line asymmetries in a large sample of quasar civ bels .",
    "the following results were shown to be statistically significant .",
    "the distribution of @xmath6 is bimodally split in the radio sector of qso parameter space : rqqs have smaller , usually negative @xmath6 values ( i.e. , rqqs generally have blue asymmetric civ bel profiles ) , in contrast to the rlqs that have @xmath6 values that are more broadly distributed with a tendency toward red asymmetric civ bel profiles ( see figures 1 and 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , the rqq @xmath6 values are not correlated with @xmath7 while the rlq @xmath6 values are correlated with @xmath7 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these results are mathematically robust .",
    "more speculatively we physically interpret these facts as arising from a two component model with the following properties ( with the justifying information in parenthesis ) .",
    "the blue asymmetry in the civ bel , @xmath58 , is associated with accretion disk physics and its interaction with the enveloping gaseous environment ( the rqq histogram in figure 3 and the standard rqq model @xcite ) .",
    "the red asymmetry in the civ bel , @xmath59 , is associated with the central engine of a powerful relativistic jet and its interaction with the enveloping gaseous environment ( the majority of rlq in the histogram in figure 3 have @xmath59 , almost no rqq have @xmath59 in the histogram .",
    "the largest @xmath59 rqq source has a powerful jet , see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the tendency for the radio jet to be associated with red asymmetry in the civ bel appears to increase as the line of sight gets closer to the radio jet axis ( the correlation of @xmath6 with @xmath7 in table 1 for rlqs and fsqs ) .",
    "these competing effects of the accretion disk and the jet can exist in various ratios within in rlqs and give rise to a panoply of civ lines shapes that are described by the correlation in figure 1 ( the rlq histogram in figure 3 ) .",
    "finally , the results above are cast in the light of the 9 historical findings that were noted in the introduction .",
    "the result a - i above ( the correlation in figure 1 ) , incorporates the findings of 2 ( cdqs have larger @xmath6 than other rlqs ) , 4 ( the largest @xmath6 are in rlqs ) , 5 ( rlqs have redder civ bels than rqqs ) , 6 ( composite civ has redder wings for rlqs than rqqs ) and 7 ( some superluminal quasars have large red wing excess ) from the introduction .",
    "the finding 8 ( rlqs have a larger spread in @xmath6 than rqqs ) from the introduction is verified by the relative spread in the histograms in figure 3 and is explained by b - iv of the consequences of the physical interpretation that are noted above .",
    "historical finding 9 ( rqqs tend to have @xmath60 ) is consistently described by results a - ii and a - iii noted at the beginning of this section .",
    "figure 2 shows that the conclusion of study 3 ( @xmath6 correlated with @xmath40 ) was an artifact of a sample in which the most luminous sources were often rlqs , as suggested in @xcite . there is no support for the conclusion found in study 1 ( ssqs have larger @xmath6 than fsqs ) in agreement with @xcite who note that the result in study 1 was only marginally significant",

    "i would also like to thank an anonymous referee who offered many ideas that improved the manuscript .",

    "<S> in this letter , the evans and koratkar atlas of hubble space telescope faint object spectrograph spectra of active galactic nuclei and quasars is used to study the redward asymmetry in civ broad emission lines ( bels ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that there is a highly significant correlation between the spectral index from 10 ghz to 1350 @xmath0 and the amount of excess luminosity in the red wing of the civ bel ( @xmath1 significance level for the full sample and the radio loud subsample independently , but no correlation is found for the radio quiet subsample ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is interpreted as a correlation between radio core dominance and the strength of the civ redward asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the data implies that within the quasar environment there is bel gas with moderately blueshifted emission associated with the purely radio quiet quasar phenomenon ( the accretion disk ) and the radio jet emission mechanism is associated with a redward bel component that is most prominent for lines of sight along the jet axis . </S>",
    "<S> thus , radio quiet quasars have civ bels that tend to show blueshifted excess and radio loud quasars show either a red or blue excess with the tendency for a dominant red excess increasing as the line of sight approaches the jet axis . </S>"
