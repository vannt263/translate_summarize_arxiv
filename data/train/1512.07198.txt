    "the large - scale clustering of dark matter is well understood at the early stages of the universe s history , when matter perturbations are small and linear theory is reliable .",
    "as the universe evolves , matter perturbations grow by gravitational instability and the scales of interest  probed by recent and current observations ",
    "reach the onset of the nonlinear regime .",
    "several models beyond linear theory have been developed since time ago in order to gain physical insight and proper interpretation of the outcomes of these observations and of n - body simulations ; see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "one of these methods is perturbation theory ( pt ) , in which the central idea is to formally expand matter and velocity fields and to generate solutions to the field equations order by order .",
    "these fields are generally proportional to the @xmath2-_sime _ power of the linear fields , which grow with time .",
    "also , matter density fluctuations have a scale dependence such that small structures become nonlinear earlier .",
    "thus , the full expansion loses its validity when higher orders become larger and larger and pt becomes meaningless ; for a review on pt see @xcite . nevertheless , it is still interesting to study the `` quasilinear '' regime within the framework of pt : here , the theory is reliable and the different versions , especially standard perturbation theory ( spt ) @xcite , lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) @xcite , and several others purposed to obtain better convergence and performance @xcite , lead to notable improvements to the linear theory at large scales .",
    "closer to the nonlinear scales , the situation changes drastically , and it is not clear at which order we start to neglect higher orders @xcite , making the theory unreliable .",
    "the main problem of pt is that in nonlinear theory all fourier modes are coupled and even those out of its reach can affect the large scales , which can be seen as integrations over all momenta in loop calculations . to tame this problem some schemes beyond pt have been proposed .",
    "one notable case is the effective field theory of large - scale structure ( eftoflss ) , both in the eulerian @xcite and lagrangian @xcite pictures .",
    "these theories are valid only at large scales , but by _ integrating out _ the ultraviolet ( uv ) physics , not amenable by pt , they incorporate backreaction effects upon long wavelength modes . as a result , the dark matter is provided with an effective stress tensor , leading to a nonperfect fluid description with viscosity and pressure perturbations . in the lagrangian formalism",
    "one can physically visualize the eft as a theory of a smoothed collection of dark matter particles with effective internal structure , sourcing the poisson equation with a multipolar field expansion ; as a result , long wavelength perturbations experience tidal forces from the uv parametrized physics .",
    "the underlying idea of eftoflss is simple and powerful , and it has shown improvements over the spt and lpt , at the cost of introducing free parameters that should be estimated by comparing to observations or to n - body simulations .",
    "other approaches , akin to eftoflss , consider from the very beginning effective imperfect viscous fluids , arriving at similar results @xcite .    during the first stages of gravitational collapse ,",
    "the dark matter is single streaming ; therefore , a perfect fluid model is well motivated and the stress tensor can be safely neglected .",
    "later , nonlinear collapse makes different streams to converge , leading to larger velocity dispersions , the formation of matter caustics and ultimately to _ shell crossing_. at shell crossing lpt breaks down , and spt probably does , too : lpt and spt have been probed to be equivalent up to third order for the matter power spectrum @xcite and the matter bispectrum @xcite , and in one dimension to all orders @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a route to continue the development of pt by truncating the boltzmann hierarchy at the second moment and by introducing the velocity dispersion tensor ( vdt ) into the field equations .",
    "nonlinear velocity dispersions for cold dark matter ( cdm ) have been considered previously , but either with the use of phenomenological effective descriptions or by considering only the scalar mode , the trace , of the vdt @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we consider the full 2-rank vdt derived directly from the boltzmann equation of collisionless , classical particles .",
    "it is expected that the convergence of the field expansion series suffers similar convergence problems as in spt and lpt , but we show that new corrections to the matter power spectrum arise that can be important , especially in the cases of warm dark matter ( wdm ) and neutrinos .",
    "we compute the vdt up to third order in pt using the lagrangian formalism , finding growing solutions starting at third order .",
    "our results depend only on the linear matter density fields and therefore can be applied to any other perturbation scheme .",
    "the introduction of the vdt leads to 25 corrections to the lagrangian displacement field ; all of them are implicitly written , some of them are explicitly computed , and their corresponding corrections to the matter power spectrum are calculated .",
    "we find that some of these corrections have the same form as those in the 1-loop eftoflss , scaling as @xmath3 , with @xmath4 depending on time as @xmath5 , and further suppressed by powers of the logarithmic linear growth factor @xmath6 .",
    "other corrections with additional @xmath1 dependence are found .",
    "all our results depend on a small dimensionless quantity : @xmath7 , the trace of the zero - order vdt evaluated today .",
    "a _ free - streaming _",
    "scale @xmath8 is introduced , below which dark matter clustering is suppressed .",
    "if the dark matter is a thermal relic , @xmath7 can , in principle , be related to the temperature to mass ratio at kinetic decoupling .",
    "nevertheless , being a very small quantity , it is susceptible to non - negligible corrections from higher orders in pt , higher momenta in the boltzmann hierarchy we are neglecting , as well as backreaction effects upon its background value @xcite . in this sense , @xmath7 could be interpreted as a free parameter as much as those in the eftoflss .",
    "the linear theory of cdm velocity dispersions has been studied recently in @xcite , suggesting lower bounds of about @xmath9 for thermally produced dark matter .",
    "nevertheless , this value seems large compared to some particle cdm theories where this value could be as small as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "if the latter is the case , the formalism developed here gives negligible corrections to pt .",
    "the case of wdm is different @xcite ; here , the dark matter particles are still relativistic at the freezing - out epoch , and velocity dispersions are still important at the stages of the formation of galaxies , inducing considerably large free - streaming scales .",
    "one effect is the appearance of an effective free - streaming scale with @xmath11 .",
    "this is a consequence of the nonlinear evolution of the vdt , which does not decay simply as @xmath12 , but instead presents growing modes that suppress the power spectrum at somewhat larger scales than in the linear theory .",
    "we argue that our formalism can be applied to neutrinos clustering during their nonrelativistic stages . in this case",
    "@xmath7 ( usually called @xmath13 in neutrino literature ) is larger , and it is well known to play an important role suppressing the total matter clustering in both linear @xcite and nonlinear @xcite theories . in an appendix to this paper we estimate the free - streaming scale of neutrinos within our formalism , finding good agreement with standard estimations in the literature ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the scales considered throughout this paper are well below the hubble horizon , while general relativity corrections are of the order @xmath14 and therefore safely within newtonian theory .",
    "furthermore , in calculations we assume an einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe both for the sake of simplicity and because the main stages of structure formation take place during the matter - dominated era .",
    "nevertheless , we keep track of the @xmath0 and @xmath15 functions to obtain a better approximation beyond eds  this procedure has been proven to give accurate results in pt .",

    "the latter is divergent if velocity dispersions are not considered , but the linear power spectrum has a cutoff at high @xmath1 when they are present .",
    "one of the consequences of these terms is a shift of the free - streaming scale , suppressing the formation of structure at larger scales , as we have seen in this paper for wdm with velocity dispersion @xmath148 , although a precise estimation of this nonlinear effect requires the full power spectrum in the presence of velocity dispersions .",
    "regarding the case of cold dark matter , if we assume it is a thermal relic , before kinetic decoupling its temperature decays like that of baryons in the early universe , that is , as @xmath162 , and after that it decays as @xmath36 ; moreover , the value of @xmath7 can be connected to the temperature to mass ratio of dark matter particles at kinetic decoupling .",
    "therefore , an estimation of @xmath7 would provide extremely useful information about the fundamental nature of dark matter and its interactions with the standard model of particles in the early universe .",
    "this seems a formidable task  if not impossible  if the dark matter is cold and therefore @xmath7 very small such that baryon nongravitational effects would mask its influence .",
    "one alternative is that of wdm , in which considerably lighter particles can suppress the halo formation just below the scales of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",

    "@xcite and reference therein .",
    "one of these concerns is about initial conditions , which are usually given by the linear ( cuttedoff ) power spectrum , bulk velocities given by 2lpt @xcite , and zero ( or underestimated ) velocity dispersions ; the latter because they are smaller than bulk zeldovich flows .",
    "recently , it was argued in @xcite that this approach is incorrect , and if velocity dispersions are considered appropriately in the initial conditions , the structure formation qualitatively changes and an interplay between a standard hierarchical top - down model at large scales and a bottom - up model at small scales is observed .",
    "we further argue that our predicted effects can not be fully observed in simulations with vanishing ( or underestimated ) initial velocity dispersions .",
    "although , we note that nonlinear features , especially those generated after shell crossing , can not be captured by our formalism but can be observed in simulations .",
    "the case of neutrinos is special because their linear velocity dispersion is considerably larger , @xmath163 , and an accurate measurement of it , represents one of the most promising methods to infer the neutrinos absolute masses @xcite , in contrast to their squared mass differences obtained from solar and atmospheric oscillation experiments .",

    "<S> we compute the dark matter velocity dispersion tensor up to third order in perturbation theory using the lagrangian formalism , revealing growing solutions at the third and higher orders . </S>",
    "<S> our results are general and can be used for any other perturbative formalism . as an application , corrections to the matter power spectrum are calculated , and we find that some of them have the same structure as those in the effective field theory of large - scale structure , with `` eft - like '' coefficients that grow quadratically with the linear growth function and are further suppressed by powers of the logarithmic linear growth factor @xmath0 ; other corrections present additional @xmath1 dependence . due to the velocity dispersions </S>",
    "<S> , there exists a free - streaming scale that suppresses the whole 1-loop power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that as a consequence of the nonlinear evolution , the free - streaming length is shifted towards larger scales , wiping out more structure than that expected in linear theory . therefore , we argue that the formalism developed here is better suited for a perturbation treatment of warm dark matter or neutrino clustering , where the velocity dispersion effects are well known to be important . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss implications related to the nature of dark matter . </S>"
