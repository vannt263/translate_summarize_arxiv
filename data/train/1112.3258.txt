    "hall effect is considered as a powerful method to probe the fermi surface of metallic compounds in general , and particularly useful to identify the nature of the charge carriers in non - magnetic systems@xcite . however , in the mixed state of superconductors , the hall voltage is mainly determined by the vortex motion along the direction of the bias current flow@xcite . in these systems ,",
    "a long standing unsolved issue is the presence of a sign reversal in the hall voltage when changing either temperature or magnetic field .",
    "there have been many experiments and theoretical studies focused on this so called anomalous hall effect .",
    "for example , sign reversals has been reported in yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 ( ybco ) crystals  @xcite and la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 thin films  @xcite , and double sign reversal and even triple sign reversal have been observed in tl@xmath8ba@xmath8cacu@xmath8o@xmath13 ( tbcco )  @xcite and hgba@xmath8cacu@xmath8o@xmath14 thin films  @xcite , respectively .",
    "several models , based on two - band  @xcite , thermal fluctuation  @xcite , pinning effect  @xcite , and vortex interaction  @xcite , have been proposed to interpret the hall anomalies . in electron - doped high - t@xmath15 superconductors , a distinct feature revealed by the angular - resolution photoemission experiments  @xcite is the coexistence of the hole- and electron - bands near the optimal doping region , which may account for the sign reversal of the hall resistivity for temperatures above the superconducting transition @xmath16  @xcite . however , for explaining the presence of sign reversals below @xmath16 , it is still necessary to discuss them in terms of vortex pinning mechanisms which have been demonstrated to play a key role  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in a seminal work , wang and ting  @xcite demonstrated that the hall resistivity @xmath17 as a function of the magnetic field in the flux flow regime exhibits a sign change due to backflow currents arising from pinning forces .",
    "however , vinokur , geshkenbein , feigelman , and blatter  @xcite on the basis of a phenomenological model which included pinning and thermal fluctuation , concluded that the magnitude of the hall angle @xmath18 , does not depend on the pinning . whether pinning is necessary for the anomalous hall effect or not is still a fundamental question , although there is clear experimental evidence indicating that the abnormal hall effect is indeed pinning dependent  @xcite .    based on their former work , wang , dong , and",
    "ting ( wdt ) developed a unified theory for the flux motion  @xcite by taking into account vortex pinning and thermal fluctuations which could explain both the single and the double sign reversals of the hall resistivity due to different pinning strength .",
    "the wdt prediction has been further confirmed by zhu _",
    "_ by a numerical simulation  @xcite .",
    "their work has clearly shown that the double sign change of @xmath17 versus the temperature appears in the weak pinning environment , while the single sign reversal occurs in the strong pinning system .",
    "importantly , the authors have also found that there are two distinctive weak pinning configurations which can achieve the double sign reversal of @xmath17(t ) , i.e. , one possesses low density of the pinning centers but with strong individual pinning potentials , whereas the other consists of a high pinning concentration of weak individual pinning potentials .",
    "an elegant experimental study by kang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite unambiguously showed the relevance of the pinning strength for the sign reversal of the hall resistance by irradiating a sample with heavy - ion to progressively increase the pinning strength .",
    "what it is still lacking is a more tunable pinning which allows one to go from the strong limit to the weak limit .",
    "in this case , one may expect a transition from the single sign reversal to the double sign reversal in the hall resistivity @xmath17 .    in the present work , we present experimental evidence on the relevance of the pinning strength in determining the number of sign reversals in the hall voltage .",
    "we show that despite the fact that lcco thin films exhibit only one sign reversal with the applied field perpendicular to the @xmath19-plane , a second sign reversal emerges either when rotating the magnetic field and maintaining the same perpendicular component or by changing the pinning strength by substituting co for cu in order to obtain la@xmath0ce@xmath1(cu@xmath3co@xmath4)o@xmath2 ( lcco : co ) .",
    "these two different methods show that the transition of the hall sign reversals from single to double , coincides with the change in the pinning environment from strong to weak .",
    "our experimental results are in agreement with previous prediction based on analytical and numerical investigations  @xcite .",
    "all the lcco thin films used in the present work were fabricated by a dc magnetron sputtering method  @xcite .",
    "the transport measurements of both lcco and lcco : co thin films were carried out by using a commercial quantum design ppms-14 .",
    "more details about the film preparation and the measurement setup can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "all the thin films were patterned by photolithography and subsequent ion milling , into bridges of @xmath20 long , @xmath21 wide and with six terminals .",
    "the critical transition temperatures @xmath22 for lcco and lcco : co are @xmath23 and 13  k as reported in our previous work  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the upper critical magnetic field @xmath24 for lcco is about 10  tesla  @xcite .",
    "let us start by demonstrating experimentally that the tilting of the magnetic field with respect to the plane of a thin lcco film leads to significant changes in the pinning properties as well as the sign reversal of the hall resistivity @xmath17 .",
    "in order to investigate this effect we study the hall resistivity @xmath25 and longitudinal resistivity @xmath26 as a function of the perpendicular field @xmath27 by either varying the strength but maintaining the field orientation perpendicular to the @xmath19-plane ( mode a ) or by changing the angle @xmath28 between the field and the @xmath19-plane with constant field intensity ( mode b ) . during the measurements ,",
    "the applied current @xmath29 in the @xmath19-plane is always perpendicular to the magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "this method allows us to discern the effects arising purely from the out of the plane component of the applied field from those originated by the in - plane field .",
    "first we would like to point out that in the lcco sample and for @xmath31 , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 curves overlap with each other no matter whether the perpendicular component of the magnetic field changes its magnitude or its orientation  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the contribution of parallel - field component ( @xmath34 ) to the magnetoresistance is negligible in comparison with @xmath27 .",
    "the question naturally arises whether this is also true for the case of @xmath35 . in fig .",

    "notice that @xmath39 with @xmath40-plane has the maximum value at @xmath41  t and drops to zero when the magnetic field is decreased down to 1.4  t without reversing its sign , whereas the @xmath42 measurement via rotation of the field exhibits a clear sign change from positive to negative in the low field region .     versus @xmath27 ( @xmath43 ) in lcco thin films at 15  k by different field changing modes .",

    "when the magnetic field is titled away from the @xmath6-axis , two different kinds of vortices appear in the samples  @xcite , namely pancake vortices with the field component perpendicular to the @xmath19-plane , and josephson vortices with the component parallel to the @xmath19-plane , as shown in the inset of fig .",

    "therefore , a hysteresis in the depinning field may appear  @xcite .",
