    "experimental measurements of the reaction @xmath7 at neutron momenta of 1.88 gev / c @xcite show a typical cross section structure known as the abc  effect @xcite .",
    "the main features of this effect can be explained by assuming a double @xmath8 excitation to be the dominant reaction mechanism for the @xmath4 production @xcite .",
    "therefore the @xmath7 reaction allows us to study the influence of direct @xmath5 and @xmath6 interaction potentials .",
    "the feynman diagram corresponding to the @xmath5 mechanism is shown in fig .",
    "in order to incorporate the interaction dynamics of the @xmath5 system in a proper and efficient way , we apply a coupled channel approach @xcite deduced from @xmath9hole models .",
    "the matrix element is calculated using the so  called source function formalism @xcite .",
    "we set up a system of coupled integro ",
    "differential equations for the correlated @xmath5 wavefunction , which can be solved in configuration space with the lanczos method @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 resonance is treated thereby as a quasi  particle with a given mass and an intrinsic , energy ",
    "dependent width .",
    "we construct the interaction potentials @xmath10 and @xmath11 within a meson exchange model @xcite .",
    "the exchanged mesons taken into account are the pion ( @xmath12 ) , the rho ( @xmath13 ) , the omega ( @xmath14 ) , and the sigma ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "all the parameters of the potentials , such as the coupling constants , cutoffs and meson masses , are determined from other reaction studies , like single pion production and charge exchange reactions on the deuteron @xcite .",
    "fig .  [ fig2 ] shows the result of our full model calculation compared to the experimental deuteron spectrum for @xmath2 .",
    "the overall agreement is very good .",
    "the cross section exhibits characteristic enhancements at missing masses close to @xmath16 ( corresponding to maximal and minimal deuteron recoil momentum in the laboratory frame ) and at the largest missing masses possible ( the central peak ) .",
    "this structure can be easily understood as follows @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath17 where @xmath18 denote the four  momenta of the two pions .",
    "the @xmath5 mechanism is most efficient if both @xmath9 s are on  mass shell , which requires @xmath19 this condition is equivalent to @xmath20 and can be satisfied in two ways :      in the latter case , the @xmath4 cms is identical to the rest frame of the deuteron and hence the overall cms .",
    "the two pions pick up the whole kinetic energy which means @xmath24 max .",
    "this leads to the high mass enhancement which corresponds to the anti  parallel decay of the two @xmath9 s , while the low mass enhancement ( @xmath21 ) corresponds to the parallel decay .",
    "these two different kinematical situations are also manifest in the angular distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for @xmath25 gev / c ( in the lab frame ) ,",
    "the pions are emitted back to back and any angle between @xmath26 and the beam axis is kinematically possible .",
    "the shape of the cross section reflects the spin  structure of the @xmath3 excitation @xcite . for @xmath27 1.1 and 1.9 gev / c ,",
    "the pions are emitted nearly parallel and have identical energies , hence @xmath26 is dominantly perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "[ fig4 ] demonstrates the influence of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 interaction potentials in our model calculation .",
    "the result for @xmath28 ( dashed  dotted line ) clearly shows the three peak structure as discussed above .",
    "the potential @xmath29 is attractive and thus results in even more pronounced peaks ( dashed line ) since it simply lowers the overall excitation energy .",
    "inclusion of @xmath30 , however , leads to a redistribution of strength from the peaks towards the kinematical less favored situations between ( solid line ) .",
    "this is the case because the optimal configuration with both @xmath9 s on mass - shell can now also be reached if the initial momentum distribution was asymmetric .    to summarize",
    "we have shown that 1 .",
    "the @xmath3 excitation is the dominant reaction mechanism in the @xmath31 two pion production at @xmath1 gev / c , and 2 .",
    "the intermediate @xmath5 and @xmath6 interactions play an important role in this reaction which therefore may serve as a tool for closer examination of the interaction potentials ."
