    "besides the dominant dipole mie plasmon , many other electron modes , both electric and magnetic , can exist in atomic clusters @xcite .",

    "it is a demanding problem to observe them in atomic clusters .",
    "the multipole electron modes represent an essential part of electron dynamics in both collective and electron - hole domains .",
    "they are connected with basic cluster properties and thus can serve as an effective tool for their investigation .",
    "we will pay the main attention to three infrared modes : scissors magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , twist magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) and electric quadrupole ( e2 ) .",
    "these modes are connected basic properties of atomic clusters . besides , they are the strongest spin - saturated modes beyond the mie plasmon .",
    "the scissors and twist modes are of orbital magnetic character @xcite .",
    "in general , the scissors mode exists only in deformed systems .",
    "it dominates the van vleck paramagnetism @xcite and can result in dia - para magnetic anisotropy in particular light atomic clusters @xcite .",
    "the twist mode is the strongest magnetic orbital mode in spherical clusters where the scissors mode vanishes @xcite .",
    "it is mainly generated by transitions between electron levels with maximal orbital moments .",
    "altogether , the scissors and twist modes are fundamental sources of orbital magnetism in spin - saturated clusters . in deformed clusters",
    ", the scissors m1 is coupled to electric quadrupole e2 mode .",
    "the infrared e2 mode is most interesting in two particular cases of deformed clusters : free light deformed clusters and embedded oriented rods ( strongly prolate large clusters ) . in the first case ,",
    "the e2 mode is reduced to a few electron - hole excitations driven by cluster deformation . as was recently demonstrated ,",
    "these excitations allow to determine the mean field spectra of light clusters @xcite .",
    "being sensitive to cluster structure , these spectra can deliver important information on diverse cluster features . and",
    "last , but not least , the infrared electron - hole quadrupole excitations have a good chance to be observed in particular two - photon processes .    infrared e2 modes in oriented silver rods embedded into glass matrices @xcite represent another useful example of non - dipole electron motion in clusters .",
    "these modes are collective and in principle can be studied in raman scattering ( experiments of this kind are in progress @xcite ) .",
    "because of the extreme axis ratio , rods represent a unique sample for investigation of both e2 and m1 ( scissors ) collective motion .",
    "being non - dipole , the infrared multipole states can not be populated by one - photon transitions which excite exclusively dipole modes .",
    "thus one has to use two - photon processes ( tpp ) where the target state is populated via an intermediate dipole state by two ( absorption and emission ) dipole transitions .",
    "the dipole plasmon or isolated dipole states can serve as the intermediate state .",
    "some of the processes , raman scattering ( rs ) , stimulated emission pumping ( sep ) , and stimulated adiabatic raman passage ( stirap ) , are widely used in atomic and molecular spectroscopy to populate non - dipole modes but their applications to clusters are still very limited and , at a first glance , even questionable .",
    "the problems are caused by particular clusters properties ( dense spectra , broad level structures , harmonicity of collective modes , short lifetimes , non - radiative decay channels , etc ) which can hamper tpp .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that tpp listed above can be applied to clusters and deliver valuable information on cluster properties ( see preliminary discussion and first estimations in @xcite ) .",
    "specific requirements to tpp applications will be considered in detail .",

    "multipole modes are oscillations of multipolarity @xmath0 which are typical for finite many - body systems .",
    "it is useful to distinguish collective and non - collective multipole modes . in the first case , one deals with a superposition of many elementary excitations which form a coherent motion while in the second case the mode represents a mixture of only a few elementary excitations . in mesoscopic systems with @xmath1 particles ,",
    "we have an intermediate ( and maybe the most complicated ) situation when a large number of small elementary components contribute coherently and thus form the collective part of the mode while a few dominant components determine its particle - hole structure .",
    "just such systems will be considered in the present study .",
    "more specifically , we will deal with metal clusters where valence electrons move freely in a common mean field .",
    "the single - particle levels of the mean field are bunched into quantum shells @xcite which constitute a key point in understanding the nature of multipole modes and their classification .    a useful sorting scheme for single - particle levels of valence electrons in metal clusters is provided by the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xcite .",

    "the simplest case of axial shape is most suitable for the analysis .",
    "iii ) shape isomers exhibit different single - electron spectra @xcite , which can smear out the low - energy spectral lines .",
    "the heavier clusters , the more isomers @xcite .",
    "so , light clusters with one dominant equilibrium shape are preferable . between them",
    ", we should choose the clusters whose ground state and first isomers have the similar ( prolate or oblate ) shape .",
    "thus we will minimize the spectral blurring .",
    "iv ) the jellium approximation is certainly rough for description of details in light clusters , which establishes a lower limit for the cluster size . the results for the smallest samples may not reach a quantitative level , but they are still useful for the first consideration .",
    "as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : e1_plasmon ] , even in the lightest clusters the jellium tdlda sufficiently well reproduces the basic characteristics of the mie plasmon ( average energy , principle gross - structure , magnitude of the deformation splitting of the resonance ) , see for discussion @xcite .",
    "such accuracy suffices for our present survey . for this reason , as well as for the sake of simplicity",
    ", our study will exploit the jellium approximation .",
    "we start our analysis with quadrupole excitations in light deformed free sodium clusters .",
    "the hierarchy of e2 modes is illustrated in fig .",

    "though e2 modes are not observed in the photoabsorption , it is instructive for a first overview .",
    "let us first consider the strong quadrupole resonance appearing at high frequencies in the range 2 - 4 ev . in heavy clusters",
    "this resonance is associated with the quadrupole plasmon . the resonance is mainly formed by e2 transitions over two major shells ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "it exists in clusters of any shape and exhausts most of the quadrupole strength .",
    "though the resonance is energetically close to the dipole mie plasmon , it can be discriminated by means of angular - resolved electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( ar - eels ) at electron scattering angles @xmath20 @xcite .        in the present study , we are not so much interested in the quadrupole plasmon but in non - collective infrared quadrupole modes which can deliver important information about the electron single - particle spectrum near the fermi ( = homo ) level .",
    "the infrared spectra are associated with the low - energy @xmath21 branch created by e2 transitions inside the valence shell .",
    "being of the @xmath22 origin , most of these spectra can exist only in clusters with _",
    "partly _ occupied valence shell , i.e. in deformed clusters .",
    "the deformation splits the infrared quadrupole mode into branches @xmath2320 , 21 and 22 . in fig .",
    "1 , the infrared modes reside at 0.5 - 1.5 ev .",
    "as compared with the quadrupole plasmon , the infrared spectrum is very dilute .",
    "it is represented only by a few well separated levels .",
    "this prevents mixing of @xmath10 configurations by the residual interaction and creation of collective states .",
    "the infrared quadrupole modes persist to keep their @xmath10 nature . as is seen from fig .",

    "the dominant @xmath10 component typically attains @xmath34 .",
    "the infrared modes provide valuable information about cluster s properties .",
    "as is seen from [ fig : fig3 ] , most of the transitions connect the levels arising due to deformation splitting .",
    "the corresponding infrared modes are determined by the deformation and vanish at the spherical shape .",
    "thus they deliver information on the deformation splitting of the electron levels in the homo - lumo region .",
    "besides , being combined with photoemission data for the spectra of occupied electron states ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the infrared @xmath10 modes immediately yield energies of unoccupied electron states . as a result",
    ", one can get the complete electron spectrum in the homo - lumo region .",
    "this spectrum is sensitive to different cluster features ( interplay of equilibrium and isomer cluster s shapes , ionic structure , correlations , temperature effects , etc . ) and so can serve as an effective tool for investigation of these features .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that in deformed systems the electric and magnetic modes with the same projection @xmath35 and space parity @xmath36 are mixed .",
    "the mixture of electric e21 and magnetic orbital m11 excitations is especially interesting as it provides access to the orbital m1 scissors mode @xcite .",
    "the properties of this mode are sketched in the next subsection .",
    "the scissors mode ( sm ) is a general collective flow already predicted or found in different finite quantum systems ( atomic nuclei @xcite , quantum dots @xcite and ultra - cold superfluid gas of fermionic atoms @xcite ) . besides",
    ", this mode is used as an indicator of bose - einstein condensate in the dilute gas of trapped bose atoms @xcite . in atomic clusters ,",
    "the sm was predicted @xcite but , in spite of some attempts @xcite , not yet observed .",
    "obviously , the sm demonstrates a universal character .",
    "it is pertinent to any finite systems with two features in common : broken spherical symmetry ( deformation ) and a two - component nature . in the systems listed above , these components are neutrons and protons in nuclei , valence electrons and ions in atomic clusters , electrons and surrounding media in quantum dots , atoms and the trap in dilute fermi and bose gases .",
    "the sm features were recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic collective nature of sm can be illustrated by the geometrical model first proposed for atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "for clusters , this model exhibits sm as scissors - like small - amplitude oscillations of valence electrons versus the ions , both assumed to form distinct spheroids ( see left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : view ] ) . hence the name _",
    "scissors _ mode .",
    "obviously , such a mode can exist only in deformed systems .    following the alternative view of @xcite ( right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : view ] ) , the displacement field of the mode is a sum of the rigid small - amplitude rotation and irrotational quadrupole term ( the latter provides vanishing velocity of electrons at the surface ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the angular velocity and @xmath39 is the parameter of quadrupole deformation expressed via the semi - axes of the ellipsoidal system .",
    "both macroscopic treatments , @xcite , include the rigid rotation of valence electrons versus the ions with the restoring force originating from the coulomb interaction between the electrons and ions .",
    "but the model @xcite has the additional irrotational quadrupole term . its physical sense becomes clear if we take into account that the sm , like the quadrupole e2 modes , is separated into low - energy ( @xmath21 ) and high - energy ( @xmath40 ) branches .",
    "the first rotational term in ( [ displ ] ) is responsible for the @xmath21 branch while the second irrotational term generates the @xmath19 branch .",
    "thus the branches have quite different physical nature .",
    "this feature is exploited as a signature of the bose - einstein condensate in dilute gas of trapped bose atoms @xcite . unlike the normal phase which exhibits both sm branches , the condensate phase supports only the irrotational flow .",
    "so , a vanishing @xmath21 branch serves as a fingerprint of the condensate .",
    "the rotational low - energy branch @xmath21 corresponds to a large extend to the scissors scenario exhibited in left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : view ] and thus is usually treated as a true sm . in atomic clusters , just this branch is responsible for van vleck paramagnetism and other effects of orbital magnetism . in what follows",
    ", we will concentrate on this part of sm .    in axial clusters ,",
    "the low - energy sm is generated by the orbital momentum fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 perpendicular to the symmetry axis @xmath43 .",
    "the mode is represented by the states @xmath44 where @xmath8 is the eigenvalue of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the space parity .",
    "energy and magnetic strength of the mode are estimated as @xcite @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of valence electrons , @xmath50 the wigner - seitz radius ( in @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 is the bohr magneton .",
    "we use here atomic units @xmath53 .",
    "the value @xmath54 stands for summed strength of the degenerated x- and y - branches .",
    "the z - branch vanishes for symmetry reasons .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath55 transition strength does not depend on @xmath50 and so is the same for different metals .",
    "both energy and magnetic strength are proportional to the deformation parameter @xmath56 and thus vanish in spherical systems .",
    "so , the sm exists only in system with a broken spherical symmetry .",
    "the larger the deformation , the stronger the low - energy scissors mode .",
    "it worth noting that we assume here global deformation of the system .",
    "at the same time , spherical symmetry can be broken locally while keeping the global spherical shape .",
    "this takes place , e.g. , in spherical clusters where the ionic background as such destroys locally the spherical symmetry and gives rise to some m1 ( though rather weak ) orbital strength even with _",
    "zero _ global deformation @xcite .",
    "the irrotational @xmath19 branch of sm takes place in both systems , spherical and deformed .",
    "its energy maps the energy of the quadrupole plasmon .",
    "in fact the irrotational sm is a part of this plasmon .",
    "the microscopic treatment of the sm is based on the shell structure of axially deformed mean field @xcite .",

    "@xmath58 , promote low - energy @xmath59 transitions inside the valence shell and high - energy @xmath60 transitions across two shells .",

    "( [ eq : me ] ) shows that the scissors mode is generated by @xmath66 transitions between the components of the same spherical @xmath67-level . in spherical systems @xmath68-states belonging to the level @xmath67",
    "are degenerate while in deformed systems they exhibit the deformation splitting and so may be connected by m1 transitions with non - zero excitation energies .",
    "this is the microscopic origin of the scissors mode .",
    "the energy scale of the scissors mode is determined by the deformation energy splitting and so is rather small .",
    "this explains the predominantly low - energy ( @xmath69=0 ) character of the true sm .",
    "there is an intimate connection between the scissors and quadrupole e21 modes in deformed clusters .",
    "if fact , both sm and e21 are parts of a general motion characterized by the states @xmath44 . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let s again consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : me ] ) .",
    "as was mentioned above , the sm operator connects only components from one and the same basis level @xmath70 .",
    "this is because the operators @xmath57 and @xmath71 have no @xmath72-dependent part and so , due to orthogonality of the radial wave functions @xmath73 , can not connect the components with different @xmath70 .",
    "but the latter can be done by the quadrupole operator @xmath74 . in this sense",
    "the sm operator is more selective than e21 , though both operators generate transitions of the same multipolarity .",
    "the states @xmath75 involve both sm and e21 modes and respond to both m11 and e21 external fields .",
    "the states are treated as magnetic or electric , depending on each of the two responses dominates .",
    "the dual nature of the states @xmath44 is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : e2_m1 ] .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence between the e21 and sm peaks takes place .",
    "these peaks represent @xmath10 states @xmath29-[110]\\}_{21}$ ] in na@xmath25 , @xmath30-[211]\\}_{21}$ ] in na@xmath26 , and @xmath32-[200]\\}_{21}$ ] , @xmath32-[202]\\}_{21}$ ] in na@xmath27 .",
    "the first free states originate from the deformation splitting of spherical levels and thus give rise to sm . in principle , these states carry both e21 and sm flows and the ratio between two contributions depends on the actual state structure .",
    "the plot for na@xmath76 gives an instructive example .",
    "it is seen that the lower peak determined by @xmath77 \\to [ 202]$ ] transition between the members of the deformation multiplet exhibits an appreciable magnetic dipole strength and thus should carry a large sm fraction .",
    "just such deformation - induced infrared states provide access to sm . instead , the higher peak is determined by a @xmath77 \\to [ 200]$ ] transition which takes place even in spherical case .",
    "the deformation is not crucial here .",
    "this state favors the e21 field and so can be treated as an ordinary quadrupole mode .",
    "static orbital magnetism in clusters was widely explored during last decades .",
    "the studies were mainly based on the landau theory of the atomic magnetism @xcite .",
    "a variety of issues was covered : giant dia- and paramagnetism in weak magnetic fields @xcite , size and temperature effects @xcite , manifestation of quantum supershells in magnetic susceptibility @xcite , influence of cluster shape ( both axial and triaxial ) on the magnetic properties @xcite , anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in deformed clusters @xcite , orbital magnetism of supported clusters @xcite , etc ..    in the present study , we will consider some principle points of the orbital magnetism , connected with the scissors mode : the decisive role of sm in van vleck paramagnetism @xcite and the related effect of dia - para anisotropy in magnetic susceptibility of particular light clusters @xcite .",
    "the latter effect displays a peculiarity of small clusters to exhibit strong variations in their properties with a cluster size .",
    "for example , rpa calculations @xcite show that the sm energies and b(m1 ) strengths , though mainly scaling with the deformation @xmath78 and the electron number @xmath79 according to the trends ( [ eq : om ] ) and ( [ eq : b(m1 ) ] ) , demonstrate , nevertheless , strong fluctuations .",
    "this can affect the magnetic susceptibility and lead , in particular cases , to dia - para anisotropy .    at this point",
    ", we introduce a few equations to make the discussion more precise .",
    "the interaction of cluster valence electrons with a uniform magnetic field @xmath80 applied along the coordinate axis @xmath81 is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the coordinate index , @xmath84 is the @xmath81-th projection of the angular moment operator ( the sum runs over all valence electrons ) , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "we neglected in ( [ eq : magn_int ] ) electron spins since for clusters considered below ( axial sodium clusters with even @xmath79 and completely filled fermi level ) their contribution to the magnetic susceptibility is expected to be small .",
    "if the magnetic field is weak , one can use the perturbation theory .",
    "then , up to the second order to @xmath80 , the induced change of the ground state energy is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the energy of the excited state @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the average value of @xmath92 .",
    "the negative second and positive third terms in ( [ eq : pert ] ) are responsible for the temperature independent van vleck paramagnetism and langevin diamagnetism , respectively .",
    "the first ( linear ) term in ( [ eq : pert ] ) dominates in the systems with a partly filled fermi level since in this case there is only incomplete mutual compensation of the contributions of the valence electrons with different orbital projections @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , this term results in a strong diamagnetic moments @xmath93 ( @xmath94 is the bohr radius ) , it is much stronger than the atomic one",
    ".    we will consider axially ( z - symmetric ) deformed clusters with even @xmath49 and fully occupied fermi level . in this case , the linear term in ( [ eq : pert ] ) is zero but there remains the van vleck term for @xmath95 .",
    "the orbital magnetic susceptibility @xmath96 is then the sum of langevin diamagnetic and van vleck paramagnetic terms : @xmath97 where @xmath98 @xmath99 having denoted by @xmath100 the cranking moment of inertia and by @xmath101 its rigid moment of inertia .    note that for @xmath95 the operator entering in the matrix element in ( [ eq : chi_para ] ) is exactly the scissors generator .",
    "this makes evident that just the _ low - energy _",
    "sm mainly contributes to @xmath102 .",
    "following our calculations @xcite , this contribution achieves @xmath103 .",
    "so , just _ the sm determines the van vleck paramagnetism_.    in the schematic model @xcite , the moment of inertia comes out as the rigid - body value , so that @xmath104 and @xmath105 , i.e. a complete compensation of dia- and paramagnetic terms in @xmath106 takes place . due to axial symmetry",
    ", one also has @xmath107 .",
    "the total susceptibility becomes , therefore , strictly anisotropic @xcite @xmath108 varying from zero to diamagnetic values .",
    "however , strong shell effects in some light clusters may alter appreciably the above result .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath109 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dia_para ] .",
    "because of very low excitation energy of the sm in this cluster @xcite , the paramagnetic susceptibility is so much enhanced that it can not be balanced by the diamagnetic term .",
    "so , @xmath110 gains the remarkable property to be paramagnetic in x , y - directions and diamagnetic in z - direction .",
    "the cluster @xmath111 also hints this property .",
    "though dia- and paramagnetism are weak as compared with other forms of magnetism , the dia - para anisotropy described above is big enough to be measured experimentally .",
    "this effect is only one of the examples of diverse unusual magnetic properties of small clusters ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "altogether , these properties may provide an interesting perspective for new technologies .",
    "the sm is the dominant orbital magnetic mode in deformed clusters .",
    "but in spherical clusters the sm vanishes and the next orbital magnetic mode , twist m2 , becomes the strongest one @xcite .",
    "this twist was first proposed as an quadrupole torsional vibrational flow of an elastic globe @xcite .",
    "the mode is generated by the operator @xmath112 with the velocity field @xmath113 and small angle @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic image of twist is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : twist ] .",
    "the mode is treated as small - amplitude rotation - like oscillations of upper hemisphere against the lower hemisphere .",
    "the rotational angle of horizontal layers is proportional to @xmath43 ( projection to the axis of rotation ) .",
    "so , the flow vanishes at the equator and poles of the system .",
    "the restoring force of the twist is determined by the quadrupole distortions of the fermi surface in the _ momentum _ space .",
    "so , the twist represents transverse magnetic quadrupole oscillations of an _ elastic _",
    "medium , generated by variation of the kinetic - energy density .",
    "the twist is a general feature of any 3-dimensional finite fermi system which exhibits an elastic behavior .",
    "the twist mode is well known in atomic nuclei and still remains an actual topic of both theoretical and experimental studies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the interest on twist is motivated by the fact that this mode is a remarkable example of an elastic vortex motion .",

    "the levels belong to the last occupied and first empty electron quantum shells . as a result ,",
    "the twist can in principle deliver information about single - particle levels with _ maximal _",
    "orbital momenta near the fermi surface .",
    "calculations @xcite show that the twist strength _ dominates _ over the spin strength already in clusters with @xmath134 .",
    "starting with @xmath135 , the orbital contribution becomes overwhelming and demonstrates for @xmath136 a huge value of @xmath137 . as both spin and orbital long - wave m1 responses are forbidden in spherical clusters ( their m1-transition matrix elements are proportional to the radial integral @xmath138 and thus vanish in the non - diagonal case subject to ortho - normalization requirement ) , the twist becomes the _",
    "strongest _ multipole magnetic mode already for clusters of medium size .",
    "this emphasizes its fundamental character .",
    "the search for the twist in atomic clusters is a demanding problem .",

    "exploration of twist in atomic nuclei hints that one might try to search this mode in clusters by means of angular resolved electron - energy - loss - spectroscopy ( eels ) @xcite .",
    "since twist contributes to the transverse form - factor , the back angles of scattered electrons are most suitable .",
    "as compared with other non - dipole modes , infrared quadrupole states deserve special attention .",
    "there are at least two samples , i ) free light deformed clusters and ii ) oriented silver rods embedded in a matrix , where these modes can be studied experimentally in two - photon processes .",
    "the light deformed clusters are especially interesting @xcite since their quadrupole modes provide access to the single electron spectra . in turn",

    "since atomic clusters are similar to molecules , it would be natural to implement the same reactions to clusters .",
    "however , applications of tpp to clusters are still very scarce .",
    "this can be partly explained by our poor knowledge on non - dipole low - energy electron modes in clusters , and partly by peculiarities of clusters .    in this section",
    "we discuss applicability of some traditional tpp methods to clusters with particular emphasis on infrared quadrupole modes . in this connection",
    ", some cluster properties essential for tpp should be closely scrutinized .",
    "namely :    \\i ) the dominant decay channel of cluster levels is usually not radiative .",
    "the collective states , like the dipole plasmon , mainly decay through landau fragmentation ( dissipation of the collective motion through surrounding @xmath10 excitations ) . for non - collective states ,",
    "the electron - electron collisions and electron - ion coupling are most essential .",
    "\\ii ) _ collective _ electron modes in clusters have very short lifetimes .",
    "the typical example is the dipole plasmon which represents in medium large clusters with @xmath139 a broad ( @xmath140 0.5 - 1 ev ) mode with a life time of 10 - 20 fs .",
    "this is due to a coupling of the collective strength with energetically close 1eh states whose availability increases with increasing cluster size @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is similar to landau damping of the plasmon in the bulk electron gas @xcite .",
    "its analogue in finite systems is called therefore landau fragmentation .",
    "the short lifetimes hamper application of adiabatic tpp methods as they would require more intense laser irradiation . the intense irradiation results in strong dynamical stark shifts and undesirable population of high - energy states by second harmonic of the laser pulses .",
    "these effects can be detrimental for adiabatic tpp especially if the cluster spectrum is not sufficiently dilute . _ non - collective _ electron modes ( as low - lying quadrupole @xmath10 ones ) have much longer life times that can approach ps for low temperature and hundreds fs for the room temperature @xcite . unlike molecules , these modes in metal clusters are mainly driven by the mean field similar to the nuclear one .",
    "this allows their unambiguous treatment at least in light clusters with 5 - 20 atoms .",
    "\\iii ) clusters exhibit a strong shape isomerism .",

    ". thus one may hope that methods of molecular spectroscopy can be applied to clusters .",
    "it is worth noting that , as compared with molecules , clusters provide new possibilities for investigation of electron modes .",
    "the electron spectra in clusters are very diverse ( from the collective plasmons to the pure @xmath10 configurations ) and , at the same time , are easily classified and treated in terms of electronic quantum shells .",
    "light free clusters with 5 - 20 atoms have dilute spectra , a feature which allows to avoid some of the troubles listed above .",
    "landau fragmentation in such clusters is very weak , the infrared levels are not so broad and their lifetimes are much longer .",
    "most of light clusters have larger isomer energies such that they have one clearly preferred equilibrium shape and many of the energetically close isomeric shapes are similar to the ground state one @xcite , thus minimizing blurring of the low - energy spectra .",
    "beams of size - selected singly - charged light clusters are readily available .",
    "the cluster temperature @xmath140 100 - 200 k could be optimal for our aims .",
    "then the thermal broadening of electron levels is small .",
    "oriented silver rods embedded into glass @xcite represent another interesting sample to be studied in tpp .",
    "these clusters are known as commercial polarizers .",
    "the polarization is provided by the property of the @xmath141 branch of the dipole plasmon to absorb only the light aligned along the symmetry axis of the cluster . because of the big axis ratio , the rods represent an example of atomic clusters with an extreme deformation .",
    "these heavy clusters can be studied in raman scattering @xcite .",
    "following the general tpp scheme presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , the target quadrupole level is populated via an intermediate dipole state by two ( absorption and emission ) dipole transitions . both the collective dipole plasmon and non - collective @xmath10 configurations can serve as intermediate states .",
    "the tpp via the dipole plasmon , with its broad and smoothed structure and ultra - fast decay through landau damping , reminds the population transfer via continuum .",
    "the tpp via non - collective @xmath10 dipole states is more transparent and represents the typical population transfer process in tree - bound - state @xmath8-systems .    as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , there are possible tpp paths via dipole states with @xmath142 and 11",
    ". these states could be , for instance , branches of the dipole plasmon , separated by the deformation splitting . in the first case ,",
    "the population of @xmath1422 mode is forbidden and only 20 and 21 modes can be targeted .",
    "this provides some selection when carrying out tpp experiments .    for a crude analysis of tpp in clusters ,",
    "one may use the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) that allows to discard the fast laser frequencies and treat the problem with the much lower rabi frequencies only .",
    "[ fig : sep_scheme ] for na@xmath26 shows a typical electron @xmath8-system and hence the scale of the laser frequencies corresponding to photoabsorption ( pump ) and photoemission ( stokes ) processes .",
    "following our calculations , even for laser pulses with intensity @xmath143 , rabi frequencies in light deformed sodium clusters lie in the interval @xmath144 ev . obviously , they are much less than the carrier ( laser ) frequencies and thus fulfill the main rwa requirement .",

    "rs is one of the simplest two - photon processes where a dipole laser - induced transition to an intermediate electronic level ( real or virtual ) is followed by the dipole spontaneous fluorescence to low - energy levels .",
    "rs measurements of electron infrared modes in clusters are yet very rare .",
    "for instance , the quadrupole infrared modes were observed in heavy silver clusters embedded into amorphous silica films @xcite .",
    "the dipole plasmon was used as a resonant intermediate state . in the recent experiment of this group with another sample",
    "( oriented silver rods embedded into glass ) , the infrared electron quadrupole mode , probably @xmath149 , was detected @xcite .",
    "these observations show that the dipole plasmon can be used as intermediate state for tpp in spite of its extremely short lifetime .",
    "this is the encouraging message for tpp implementation to clusters .",
    "rs generally assumes that the coupling between the intermediate dipole and target quadrupole states , from one side , and the coupling between the intermediate and ground states , from the other side , are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "only then the final state is successfully populated .",
    "this means that the absorption and emission dipole matrix elements should be of the same scale .",
    "experiments of e. duval @xcite show that this is indeed the case for heavy clusters . in light deformed clusters",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "our calculations @xcite for na@xmath25 , na@xmath26 and na@xmath27 revealed that the absorption and emission dipole matrix elements lie mainly in the interval 2 - 10 @xmath150 ( atomic units ) and thus are basically similar .",
    "this means that infrared quadrupole modes in light deformed clusters have a chance to be observed in the resonant rs running via the dipole plasmon .",
    "however , we have also found a few exceptions when the stokes couplings are strongly suppressed due to destructive interference effects ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the particular example is oblate na@xmath25 where only the path via the @xmath151 branch of dipole plasmon results in a strong tpp while the alternative path via the @xmath152 branch is about completely suppressed .",
    "such considerable variations for different paths are not surprising for small clusters where electronic spectra and transition rates are very specific and can appreciably change from one sample to another . in clusters with suppressed dipole couplings ,",
    "the rs is not effective .",
    "besides , the rs has a general drawback that its photoemission step is fully dictated by competition between different decay channels of the intermediate state . as a result",
    ", the spontaneous fluorescence to the target state and hence the rs efficiency is typically rather low . to overcome this trouble",
    ", we should consider methods with _ stimulated _ emission into the target level",
    ".      the stimulated emission pumping ( sep ) enjoys widespread application for atoms and molecules and seems to be very promising for population of infrared quadrupole states in clusters .",
    "unlike rs , this method exploits two lasers , pump and stokes ( or dump ) @xcite .",
    "the pump pulse is responsible for the first photoabsorption step .",
    "the stokes pulse couples the intermediate state to the target one .",
    "the pulses can be simultaneous or sequential .",
    "if the difference between the pump and stokes frequencies is in resonance with the frequency of the target state , then the stokes radiation stimulates emission to this state .",
    "one should distinguish sep with incoherent and coherent irradiation .",
    "if incoherent light sources are used , then , even in the best case of the saturated process and coincident pump and stokes pulses , the maximal sep efficiency achieves only one - third of the complete population @xcite . in practice , the transfer efficiency does not exceed 10@xmath153 .",
    "however , even this value is enough for many spectroscopic studies .",
    "a much better population can be achieved for coherent laser irradiation .",
    "if the pump and stokes pulses coincide , then under certain requirements ( given in the next subsection ) we can even gain the fully adiabatic process ( with still not complete population transfer as compared with stirap @xcite ) . in this subsection , we consider the coherent sep with an appreciable detuning ( often called as off - resonant stimulated raman ) .",
    "this process promises a simple , robust and efficient population scheme .",
    "we present below our tdlda results for sep in na@xmath26 .",
    "the calculations explore the time evolution of the initial single - electron states .",

    "their frequencies maintain the two - photon resonance with the target state : @xmath154 and are detuned somewhat below the intermediate dipole state , @xmath155 0.14 ev , so as to minimize its population .",
    "it is worth noting that an appreciable detuning is crucial as the dipole couplings in clusters are rather strong .",
    "this is the only way to suppress undesirable population of other dipole and quadrupole states and thus to enhance the population of the target state .    in fig .",

    "the electron - ion coupling should limit lifetime of the mode by a few hundred fs at a room temperature and by a few ps at a minimal temperature @xmath14010 k. the latter case corresponds to our analysis .",

    "it is remarkable that the dipole plasmon can be used as the effective mediator in spite of its extremely short lifetime .",
    "the key point is the detuning that prevents the population of the plasmon and thus the leaking from it . using the dipole plasmon as the intermediate state has the additional advantage of dealing with the well know structure rather than with still poorly known low - energy dipole states .",

    "the probe laser should be intense enough to result in measurable pes and its frequency should be large to map the single - electron states in the cluster and thus provide the complete pes @xcite .",
    "in na@xmath26 , it could be @xmath161 7 - 8 ev .",
    "the probe pulse should follow the pump one with a considerable delay so as to avoid overlapping with the latter and map only the endurant quadrupole mode . due to the raman coupling of the single - electron pes with the quadrupole oscillation ,",
    "every pes should acquire left and right satellites with the relative frequencies coinciding with @xmath162 .",
    "hence we get the frequency of the quadrupole state .",
    "the strategy is to keep the fixed pump frequency with a reasonable detuning bellow the intermediate dipole state and scan the stokes frequency .",
    "when we get the resonance satellites @xmath163 , then the endurant quadrupole mode has to be produced and detected .",
    "it may happen that the stokes frequency maps a dipole state . in that case",
    "the endurant dipole oscillation are accompanied by a subsequent considerable increase of photoemission yield together with the appearance of dipole satellites .",
    "such cases can be easily separated from the case of interest , population of the quadrupole mode , since the latter is not associated with a significant resonant increase in photoemission yield but only by the satellites signature alone .",
    "the sep experiments usually need three lasers : pump , stokes and probe .",
    "however , one may propose the simpler recipe with implementation of only pump and probe lasers .",
    "such scheme assumes the combination of the direct two - photon excitation of the quadrupole state and pes techniques . specifically , the intense pump laser should scan until its two photons excite the quadrupole state .",
    "then the delayed probe laser is applied in the manner described above to detect the population .",
    "the calculations show that this simple method is quite effective and robust .      the stirap method @xcite promises up to 100@xmath153 population transfer from the initial to the target level .",
    "this high efficiency is achieved by the _",

    "[ fig : e2_plas ] where the resonant excitation of the dipole state at 1.38 ev leads to a huge population of the quadrupole plasmon .",

    "as is seen from the figure , the intuitive pulse sequence also results in the same quadrupole strength .",
    "it looks like this tpp embraces not only the typical stirap branch corresponding to the dark state @xmath198 but also the branch from the dark state @xmath199 .",
    "the latter takes place because of the large detuning below the intermediate dipole state . folowing @xcite , an appreciable detuning below or above the intermediate state results in the additional dark dressed state @xmath199 or @xmath200 , respectively",
    ".    though the process in fig .",
    "[ fig : strap ] looks like stirap , its stirap nature still should be proved .",
    "the point is that the strength exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : strap ] does not correspond to the population ( squared amplitude of the target state ) but rather to the coherence ( product of amplitudes of initial and target states ) .",
    "hence , the maxima of the strength at non - zero pulse shifts still do not mean that the similar maxima take place for the population of the target state .",
    "our tdlda model does not allow to estimate properly the population .",
    "however , this can be done within the rotating wave approximation for 3-level @xmath8-system @xcite . following these estimations , we have found that the tpp in the example above has the maximal population at coinciding pulses and thus is not stirap . for getting the stirap",
    "we need more intense laser pulses and maybe another value of the detuning .",
    "one may get other , and more favorable , options in clusters by a more suitable choice of the process parameters , set to worked out .",
    "in any case , the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : strap ] hints the principle possibility of stirap in atomic clusters .",
    "the experimental detection of the stirap population can be done by the same methods as in sep .",
    "the application of stirap to clusters seems to be generally feasible . at the same time , this process is more demanding to realize than sep .",
    "it requires further studies within realistic tdlda models to look for the most effective process configurations .",
    "stirap can hardly be more practicable than sep in population and detection of infrared quadrupole modes in clusters .",
    "however , one may try to implement stirap to get more transfer efficiency in particular cases . besides",
    ", stirap running via the dipole plasmon can be interesting for theory of adiabatic tpp as such .",
    "indeed , the intermediate state like the dipole plasmon does not exist in atoms and molecules and so was not yet investigated .",
    "perhaps , this intermediate state will offer new options for stirap and extend our knowledge about this intriguing tpp .",
    "non - dipole infrared electron modes in atomic clusters ( electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , magnetic dipole scissors ( m1 ) and magnetic quadrupole twist ( m2 ) ) were analyzed theoretically using as tool the time - dependent local - density approximation ( tdlda ) .",
    "the collective and non - collective nature of these modes as well as their connection with the basic cluster properties ( single electron spectra , orbital magnetism ) were analyzed in detail .",
    "free light deformed sodium clusters and embedded oriented silver rods were considered as the most promising samples .",
    "the possible routes of experimental observation of infrared quadrupole modes in two - photon processes ( raman scattering , stimulated emission pumping ( sep ) and stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) ) were scrutinized .",
    "following our analysis , the combination of sep and pes techniques provides probably the most simple and robust way to populate and detect the infrared quadrupole states in free light deformed clusters . as a complementary method ,",
    "a technique using direct two - photon excitation was also considered .",
    "the raman scattering seems to be optimal for large clusters , especially embedded oriented silver rods .",
    "the calculations encourage applicability of stirap to clusters",
    ". however , this intriguing but demanding method still needs further realistic tdlda studies .",
    "smaller clusters as , e.g. , na@xmath25 are the most promising candidates .    we hope that our study will stimulate investigation of non - dipole electron modes in clusters by means of tpp experimental methods .",
    "this would provide a deeper understanding both clusters properties and peculiarities of different tpp schemes .",
