    "classical finite volume solvers generally have a bad precision for solving two - fluid interfaces or flows in varying cross - section ducts .",
    "several cures have been developed for improving the precision .",
    "* for cross - section ducts , the well - balanced approach of greenberg and leroux @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) is an efficient tool to improve the precision . * for two - fluid flows the pressure oscillations phenomenon ( see @xcite and @xcite for instance ) can be cured by a recent tool developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is based on an ale ( arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ) scheme followed by a random sampling projection step .    in this paper , we show that is is possible to mix the two approaches in order to design an efficient scheme for computing two - fluid flows in variable cross - section ducts .",
    "we consider the flow of a mixture of two compressible fluids ( a gas ( 1 ) and a liquid ( 2 ) , for instance ) in a cross - section duct .",
    "the time variable is noted @xmath0 and the space variable along the duct is @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the cross - section at position @xmath1 .",
    "the unknowns are the density @xmath3 the velocity @xmath4 , the internal energy @xmath5 and the fraction of gas @xmath6 . following greenberg and leroux @xcite it is now classical to consider the cross - section @xmath7 as an artificial unknown .",
    "the equations are the euler equations in a duct , which read    @xmath8    with@xmath9 @xmath10 without loss of generality , in this paper we consider a stiffened gas pressure law ( see @xcite and included references ) @xmath11 the mixture pressure law parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are obtained from the pure fluid parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 thanks to the following interpolation , which is justified in @xcite@xmath16 we define the vector of conservative variables@xmath17 the conservative flux is@xmath18 and the non - conservative source term is@xmath19 such that the system ( [ first])-([last ] ) becomes @xmath20 we define the vector of primitive variables@xmath21 we define also the following quantities@xmath22 the entropy is solution of the partial differential equation@xmath23 it is useful to express also the pressure @xmath24 and the enthalpy @xmath25 as functions of @xmath26@xmath27 then in these variables the sound speed @xmath28 satisfies@xmath29 the jacobian matrix @xmath30 in system ( [ systshort ] ) admits real eigenvalues@xmath31 however , the system may be resonant ( when @xmath32 or @xmath33 . ) the quantities @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are independant riemann invariants of the stationnary wave @xmath38 . in the sequel , the vector of `` stationary '' variables @xmath39 will play a particular role @xmath40      we recall now the principles of the vfroe solver . we first consider a arbitrary change of variables @xmath41 . in practice",
    ", we will take the set of primitive variables @xmath42 ( [ primitive ] ) or the set of stationnary variables @xmath43 ( [ stationary ] ) .",
    "the vector @xmath44 satisfies a non - conservative set of equations@xmath45 the system ( [ first])-([last ] ) is approximated by a finite volume scheme with cells @xmath46x_{i-1/2},x_{i+1/2}[$ ] , @xmath47 .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the time step and by @xmath49 the size of cell @xmath50 .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 the conservative variables in cell @xmath50 at time step @xmath52 .",
    "the cross - section @xmath7 is approximated by a piecewise constant function , @xmath53 in cell @xmath50 .",
    "we consider first a very general scheme where the boundary of the cell @xmath54 moves at the velocity @xmath55 between time steps @xmath52 and @xmath56 , thus we have@xmath57 in a vfroe - type scheme , we have to define linearized riemann problems at interface @xmath58 between the state @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we introduce@xmath61 in this way , it is possibe to define@xmath62 we then consider the linearized riemann problem@xmath63 we denote its solution by@xmath64 because of the stationary wave , @xmath65 is generally discontinuous at @xmath66 we are then able to define a discontinuous arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ( ale ) numerical flux @xmath67 the sizes of the cells evolve as@xmath68 if @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the ale scheme is@xmath71 if @xmath72 then we have to add the following term to the left of the previous equation@xmath73 if @xmath74 then we have to add also the following term@xmath75      we have now to detail the choice of the variable @xmath44 and the velocity @xmath76 according to the data @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the idea is to use the classical well - balanced scheme everywhere but at the interface between the two fluids , where we use the lagrange flux .",
    "when our initial data satisfy @xmath79 , the algorithm reads    * if we are not at the interface , i.e. if @xmath80 , we take @xmath43 and @xmath81 .",
    "this choice corresponds to the vfroe well - balanced scheme described in @xcite . *",
    "if we are at the interface , i.e. if @xmath82 then we choose @xmath42 .",
    "this choice ensures that the linearized riemann solver presents no jump of pressure and velocity at the contact discontinuity .",
    "we thus denote by @xmath83 and @xmath84 the velocity and the pressure at the contact .",
    "we take @xmath85 , @xmath86 if @xmath87 and @xmath88 if @xmath89 . the lagrangian numerical flux",
    "then takes the form@xmath90      we go back to the original euler grid by the glimm procedure .",
    "we construct a sequence of pseudo - random numbers @xmath91 in practice , we consider the @xmath92 van der corput sequence @xcite .",
    "according to this number we take@xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95      the constructed scheme has many interesting properties :    * it is well - balanced in the sense that it preserves exactly all stationary states ( i.e. initial data for which the quantities @xmath96 are constant ) ; * for constant cross - section ducts , it computes exactly the contact discontinuities , with no smearing of the density and the mass fraction ; * if at the initial time the mass fraction is in @xmath97 , then this property is exactly preserved at any time .    for detailed proofs , we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some other subtleties are given in the same references .",
    "for instance , the change of variables @xmath98 is not always invertible .",
    "this implies to define a special procedure for constructing completely rigorously the well - balanced vfroe solver .",
    "in order to test our algorithm , we consider a riemann problem for which we know the exact solution .",
    "the initial data are discontinuous at @xmath99 .",
    "the data of the problem are given in table [ table ]    .numerical results .",
    "data of the riemann problem[table ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the pressure law parameters are @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 we compute the solution on the domain @xmath104 $ ] with approximately @xmath105 cells .",
    "the final time is @xmath106 and the cfl number is @xmath107 .",
    "the density , the velocity and the pressure are represented on figures [ fig : rho ] , [ fig : u ] and [ fig : p ] .",
    "we observe an excellent agreement between the exact and the approximate solution .",
    "the mass fraction is not represented : it is not smeared at all and perfectly matches the exact solution .",
    "we have constructed and validated a new scheme for computing two - fluid flows in variable cross - section ducts .",
    "our scheme relies on two ingredients :    * a well - balanced approach for dealing with the varying cross - section ; * a lagrange plus remap technique in order to avoid pressure oscillations at the interface .",
    "the random sampling remap ensures that the interface is not diffused at all .    on preliminary test cases",
    ", our approach gives very satisfactory results .",
    "we intend to apply it to the computation of the oscillations of cavitation bubbles .",
    "more results will be presented at the conference ."
