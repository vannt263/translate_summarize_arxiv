    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has recently been measured to an accuracy of 0.54 ppm  @xcite .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in the value predicted  @xcite in the standard model is given by the hadronic contribution , @xmath7 , to the lowest order .",
    "this quantity is estimated with a dispersion integral of the hadronic cross section measurements",
    ".    in particular , the pion form factor , @xmath8 , defined via @xmath9 , accounts for @xmath10 of the central value and for @xmath11 of the uncertainty in @xmath7 .",
    "the kloe experiment already published  @xcite a measurement of @xmath8 with the method described below , using an integrated luminosity of 140 pb@xmath2 , taken in 2001 , henceforth referred to as kloe05 .",
    "-0.5 cm    da@xmath0ne is an @xmath13 collider running at @xmath14 , the @xmath1 meson mass , which has provided an integrated luminosity of about 2.5 fb@xmath2 to the kloe experiment up to year 2006 .",
    "in addition , about 250 pb@xmath2 of data have been collected at @xmath15 gev , in 2006 .",
    "present results are based on 240 pb@xmath2 of data taken in 2002 .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a drift chamber  @xcite with excellent momentum resolution ( @xmath16 for tracks with polar angle larger than @xmath17 ) and an electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite with good energy ( @xmath18}$ ] ) and precise time ( @xmath19}\\oplus 100~\\mathrm{ps}$ ] ) resolution .    at da@xmath0ne",
    ", we measure the differential spectrum of the @xmath20 invariant mass , @xmath21 , from initial state radiation ( isr ) events , @xmath22 , and extract the total cross section @xmath23 using the following formula  @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radiator function .",
    "this formula neglects final state radiation ( fsr ) terms .",
    "the cross section for isr photons has a divergence in the forward angle ( relative to the beam direction ) , such that it dominates over fsr photon production . the fiducial volume  shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]  is based on the following criteria :    * two tracks with opposite charge within the polar angle range @xmath26 ; * small angle photon , @xmath27 , the photon is not explicitly detected and its direction is reconstructed from the track momenta in the @xmath28 center of mass system , @xmath29 .",
    "the above criteria result in events with good reconstructed tracks and enhance the probability of having an isr photon .",
    "furthermore ,    * fsr at the leading order is reduced to the @xmath30 level ; * the contamination from the resonant process @xmath31  where at least one of photons coming from the @xmath32 is lost  is reduced to the level of @xmath33 .",
    "discrimination of @xmath34    -@xmath35 plane ; the selected area is shown.,title=\"fig:\"]-0.5 cm    from @xmath36 events is done via particle identification  @xcite based on the time of flight , on the shape and the energy of the clusters associated to the tracks . in particular ,",
    "electrons deposit most of their energy in the first planes of the calorimeter while minimum ionizing muons and pions release uniformly the same energy in each plane .",
    "an event is selected if at least one of the two tracks has not being identified as an electron . fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows that contaminations from the processes @xmath37 and @xmath38 are rejected by cuts on the track mass variable , @xmath39 , defined by the four - momentum conservation , assuming a final state consisting of two particles with the same mass and one photon",
    "the analysis of data taken since 2002 benefits from cleaner and more stable running conditions of da@xmath0ne , resulting in less machine background and improved event filters than kloe05 .",
    "in particular , the following changes are implemented :    * a new trigger level was added at the end of 2001 to eliminate the 30% loss from pions penetrating to the outer calorimeter plane and thus were misidentified as cosmic rays events . for the 2002 data , this inefficiency has decreased down to 0.2% , as evaluated from a control sample ; * the offline background filter , which contributed the largest experimental systematic uncertainty to the published work  @xcite , has been improved .",
    "the filter efficiency increased from 95% to 98.5% , with negligible systematic uncertainty ; * the vertex requirement on the two tracks  used in kloe05  is not applied , therefore eliminating the systematic uncertainty from this source .",
    "the absolute normalization of the data sample is measured using large angle bhabha scattering events , @xmath40 .",
    "invariant mass for the process @xmath41 , from an integrated luminosity of 240 pb@xmath2.,title=\"fig:\"]-0.5 cm    the integrated luminosity , @xmath42 , is obtained  @xcite from the observed number of events , divided by the effective cross section evaluated from the monte carlo generator ` babayaga `  @xcite , including qed radiative corrections with the parton shower algorithm , inserted in the code simulating the kloe detector .",
    "an updated version of the generator , ` babayaga@nlo `  @xcite , decreased the predicted cross section by 0.7% , while the theoretical relative uncertainty improved from 0.5% to 0.1% .",
    "the experimental relative uncertainty on @xmath42 is 0.3% .",
    "the @xmath44 differential cross section is obtained from the observed spectrum , @xmath45 , after subtracting the residual background events , @xmath46 , and correcting for the selection efficiency , @xmath47 , and the luminosity : @xmath48 fig .",
