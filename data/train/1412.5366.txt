    "however , the system capacity of multi - cell cellular networks is greatly degraded by the co - channel interference even with multiple antennas at the transmitters and receivers [ 3][7 ] .",
    "therefore , a multi - cell multi - antenna cellular network is known as an interference - limited system [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] . in this case , co - channel interference modeling and capacity analysis of multi - cell multi - antenna cellular networks are of great importance in the next generation mobile communication systems .",
    "numerous interference models have been proposed in the literature for wireless communication systems [ 8][18 ] .",
    "kostic investigated the probability density function ( pdf ) of the interference caused by a single interfering transmitter over an interference channel with nakagami - m fading and shadowing in wireless networks [ 8 ] .",

    "however , the spatial distribution of interfering transmitters was not considered in [ 8][11 ] .",
    "sousa proposed that the infinite aggregated interference from the homogeneous poisson field of interferers can be modeled by an alpha stable distribution [ 12 ] .",
    "furthermore , based on [ 12 ] an analytical expression for the instantaneous and second order distributions of the interference was presented in [ 13 ] .",
    "an interference model was provided for cognitive radio networks and the impact of channel fading and power control schemes on the interference model was analyzed in [ 14 ] .",

    ", we only consider effective interferers in our general interference model . as",
    "shown in fig .",
    "1 , there are only two types of nodes .",
    "one type of nodes is the signal receiver noted as user equipment ( ue ) with @xmath0 antennas and the other type of nodes is the interfering transmitter , i.e. , base stations ( bs ) with @xmath1 antennas . without loss of generality",
    ", the locations of all bss are assumed to follow a poisson spatial distribution in a two - dimensional infinite plane [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .",
    "moreover , only one bs is assumed to exist in one cell .",
    "this general interference model can be used to describe the interference signals in multi - cell mimo cellular networks .      in the aforementioned general interference model , as illustrated in fig.1 , every signal including the interference signal passes through an independent wireless channel , which means every signal is subject to independent path loss , nakagami - m fading [ 34 ] , and shadowing effect [ 35 ] . in general , the shadowing effect can be characterized by lognormal distributions . to simplify the calculation ,",
    "the pdf of signal with shadowing effect can be approximated by gamma distribution [ 33 ] , [ 36 ] : @xmath2 with + @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the shadowing spread parameter whose value usually ranges from 4 to 9 in practice and @xmath7 is the received average signal power at the receiver .",
    "considering that the shadowing effect in the wireless channel is approximated by the gamma distribution , the wireless channel with gamma shadowing and nakagami - m fading can be further approximated by the generalized - k ( @xmath8 ) distribution [ 33 ] , [ 36 ] .",
    "without loss of generality , we select one of the users @xmath9 @xmath10 as the desired signal receiver in fig .",
    "this @xmath9 receives aggregated interference from the interfering transmitters , i.e. , bss , in the given region .",
    "the aggregated interference at @xmath9 can be expressed as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the interference signal power received by @xmath9 from the @xmath13 @xmath14 without the path loss effect , @xmath15 is the interference signal power received by the antenna @xmath16 of @xmath9 from the @xmath13 @xmath14 without the path loss effect , @xmath17 is the path loss variable with path loss coefficient @xmath18 and path distance @xmath19 from the @xmath13 @xmath14 to the user .",
    "the spatial distribution of bss is a poisson distribution with a density parameter @xmath20 .",

    "1 , an interfering transmitter , i.e. , a bs , with @xmath30 antennas has @xmath30 interference sub - streams from the closed space source and every antenna of @xmath9 can receive @xmath30 interference sub - streams from a bs .",
    "all of these interference signals coming from the same bs are assumed to pass through the independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) gamma shadowing processes and the nakagami - m fading processes .",
    "the transmission power of every antenna is assumed to be equal and normalized to 1 , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , in multi - cell mimo cellular networks , @xmath12 in ( 3d ) is the sum of the interference signal power transmitted by the @xmath30 interference sub - streams from the same @xmath13 @xmath14 without the path loss effect .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 is expressed by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a random variable of gamma shadowing process , which corresponds to the signal passing through the gamma shadowing channel from the @xmath13 @xmath14 , and @xmath34 is the random variable of nakagami - m fading process , which corresponds to the signal passing through the nakagami - m fading channel from the transmitting antenna @xmath35 of @xmath13 @xmath14 to the receiving antenna @xmath16 of @xmath9 .    because the wireless channel with gamma shadowing and nakagami - m fading can be approximated by the @xmath36 distribution , the pdf of @xmath37 can be further derived as follows based on the generalized - k random process theory [ 11 ] , [ 36 ] : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the nakagami shaping factor",

    "should be first derived .",
    "therefore , from ( 5 ) the following transform parameter @xmath44 is derived accounting for the transformation in [ 37 ] @xmath45    furthermore , we substitute ( 6 ) into ( 3d ) and perform the inverse fourier transform on the characteristic function of ( 3a ) .",

    "based on the proposed new interference model , some performance evaluations can be numerically analyzed in detail . in the following analysis , some parameters of the interference model in fig .",
    "1 are configured as default values : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . in the previous work [ 38 ] ,",
    "gaussian interference models were used .",
    "based on the default parameters , we compare the pdf of the proposed interference model with the pdf of the conventional gaussian interference model in fig .",
    "it is shown that the pdf of the proposed interference model has obvious heavy tail characteristic compared with the pdf of gaussian interference model .",
    "the heavy tail characteristic indicates that the small probability event , i.e. , the rare event , has non - ignorable impact on the alpha stable distribution .",
    "therefore , the aggregate interference in multi - cell mimo cellular networks can be easily dominated by individual high - power interfering signals .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the impact of some parameters on the proposed interference model in figs .",

    "3 shows that the probability of instantaneous interference power falling into the range from 0 to @xmath60 watt increases with the increase of the shadowing spread parameter @xmath6 .",

    "4 , the probability of instantaneous interference power within the range from 0 to @xmath61 watt decreases with the increase of the bs density parameter @xmath20 .",
    "when the instantaneous interference power exceeds @xmath62 watt , the probability of instantaneous interference power increases with the increase of @xmath20 .",
    "5 illustrates when the instantaneous interference power is less than @xmath63 watt , the pdf increases with the increase of the path loss coefficient parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the probability of instantaneous interference power gradually decreases with the increase of @xmath18 when the instantaneous interference power is larger than @xmath63 watt .",
    "6 demonstrates that the probability of instantaneous interference power decreases with the increase of the number of transmission antennas @xmath30 per interfering transmitter when the instantaneous interference power is less than @xmath64 watt .",
    "if the instantaneous interference power exceeds @xmath64 watt , the trend is reversed . in fig .",
    "7 , the probability of instantaneous interference power decreases with the increase of the number of receiving antennas @xmath65 per user when the instantaneous interference power is smaller than @xmath66 watt . after this turning point",
    ", the probability of instantaneous interference power gradually increases with the increase of @xmath65 .",
    "based on figs . 37 and",
    "the alpha stable process theory [ 39],[40 ] , it implies that these five parameters can significantly influence the burstiness of the aggregated interference in multi - cell mimo cellular networks . in fig .  8",
    ", we analyze the impact of nakagami shaping factor @xmath39 on the proposed interference model .",
    "based on the pdf shape change in fig .",
    "8 , it implies that the nakagami shaping factor has little influence on the power of aggregated interference in multi - cell mimo cellular networks .",
    "based on the proposed interference model , we further investigate the capacity of a multi - cell mimo cooperative cellular network . the multi - cell mimo cellular network considered in this paper is as follows : in the two dimensional given region , there are infinite bss with @xmath30 antennas and user terminals with @xmath65 antennas , moreover the location of interfering bss is assumed to follow the poisson spatial distribution .",

    "hence , with the specified density of interfering bss , the cooperative transmission can improve the capacity performance , but this gain of capacity performance is decreased with the increasing number of cooperative bss . when the density of interfering bss is configured as @xmath141 , compared with the capacity of one bs , the average capacity of two cooperative bss improves by 90.98% ; compared with the average capacity of two cooperative bss , the average capacity of three cooperative bss improves by 43.81% . therefore , compared with the capacity performance in the small density of interfering bss , the cooperative transmission can obviously improve the capacity performance with a high density of interfering bss .",
    "in this paper , we have derived the exact downlink average capacity of multi - cell mimo cellular network with co - channel interference .",
    "furthermore , the analytical closed - form normalized downlink average capacity for cell - edge users in a multi - cell miso cooperative cellular network with co - channel interference has been derived and analyzed numerically . to derive this downlink capacity model ,",
    "an analytical co - channel interference model has been proposed for multi - cell mimo cellular networks .",
    "based on the proposed closed - form normalized downlink average capacity of multi - cell miso cooperative cellular network with co - channel interference , numerical results have shown that the cooperative transmission can improve the capacity performance in most cases , but the capacity gains suffer from the increased number of cooperative bss or antennas .",
    "our analysis indicates that the cooperative transmission can efficiently enhance the capacity performance , especially in scenarios with high densities of interfering bss . for our future work",
    ", we will explore the impact of different cooperative transmission schemes on the system capacity .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the covariance of expected signals at the user @xmath9 .",
    "in one cooperative cluster , one cell - edge user can receive expected signals and unexpected signals transmitted from different cooperative bss . to simplify the complex of derivation , expected signals and unexpected signals from different cooperative bss in the same cooperative cluster @xmath29 received by the user @xmath9",
    "are assumed to be uncorrelated , which can be expressed as follows @xmath142 = 0,\\forall b \\ne b ' \\tag{29}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the expectation calculation operator , @xmath76 is the expected signal transmitted to the user @xmath9 by bs @xmath14 in the cooperative cluster @xmath29 , @xmath144 is the unexpected signal transmitted to the user @xmath9 by the bs @xmath78 in the cooperative cluster c. therefore , the covariance of the expected signal @xmath145 can be given by @xmath146 = p_{\\mathrm{ant } } { \\cal i } \\tag{30}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 is the unite matrix .",
    "furthermore , in the scenario of multi - cell miso cooperative cellular network , the signal covariance transmitted to the user @xmath9 by different bss in the cooperative cluster @xmath29 can be expressed by @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the channel matrices from the bs @xmath14 and bs @xmath151 to the user @xmath9 in the cluster @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "base on ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) , we only consider the nakagami - m fading effect and ( 31 ) can be further simplified as @xmath152 }    \\notag \\\\   & = p_{ant } \\sum\\limits_{b = 1}^{n_b } { \\left\\| { { \\textbf{h}}_{b , k , c } } \\right\\|_f^2 } \\notag \\\\   & = p_{ant } \\sum\\limits_{b = 1}^{n_b }   { \\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{n_t^c } { \\left| { { \\textbf{h}}_{b , j } } \\right|^2 } }     \\notag \\\\   & = p_{ant } \\sum\\limits_{b = 1}^{n_b }    { \\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{n_t^c } { \\frac{1}{{r_b^{\\sigma ^r } } }    \\left| { z_{b , j } } \\right|^2 } } .",
