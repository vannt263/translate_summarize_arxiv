    "the milnor lattice of a simple singularity is isomorphic to the root lattice of the corresponding simple lie algebra , and the simple singularity can be constructed inside this simple lie algebra as the intersection of the nilpotent cone with a transversal slice of a subregular nilpotent orbit @xcite . in search of a good class of singularities where this relationship with lie algebras might generalize ,",
    "saito introduced the notion of _ regular weight system _ @xcite and considered a generalization of root systems coming from the milnor lattices of the associated singularities @xcite .",
    "however , milnor lattices are hard to handle due to the transcendental nature of vanishing cycles , and to circumvent this difficulty , saito asked for an algebraic or combinatorial construction of the root system starting from a regular weight system @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , takahashi proposed an answer to the problem of saito based on mirror symmetry for landau - ginzburg orbifolds and its relation @xcite with the duality of weight systems @xcite .",
    "he introduced the triangulated category @xmath0 of graded matrix factorizations for a weighted homogeneous polynomial @xmath1 building on earlier papers by eisenbud @xcite , hori and walcher @xcite , kapustin and li @xcite , and orlov @xcite , which is equivalent to the _ triangulated categories of graded b - branes _ defined by orlov @xcite .",
    "he conjectured that this category for a polynomial associated with a regular weight system has a full exceptional collection and its grothendieck group is isomorphic to the milnor lattice of the singularity associated with the dual regular weight system .",
    "he in particular conjectured that when @xmath1 is the defining polynomial of a simple singularity , then @xmath0 is equivalent as a triangulated category to the bounded derived category of finite - dimensional representations of a dynkin quiver .",
    "the latter conjecture is solved by takahashi @xcite for @xmath2-singularities and by kajiura , saito , and takahashi @xcite for all the simple singularities :    [ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) ] [ thm : main ] the triangulated category of graded b - branes on a simple singularity is equivalent as a triangulated category to the bounded derived category of representations of a dynkin quiver of the corresponding type .",
    "we give another proof of the above theorem in this paper , which avoids the use of the classification of cohen  macaulay modules on simple singularities due to auslander @xcite , and is based on the theory of weighted projective lines by geigle and lenzing @xcite and a theorem of orlov @xcite on triangulated categories of graded b - branes .",
