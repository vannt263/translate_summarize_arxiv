    "recent advances in instrumental sensitivity have challenged the very definition of elliptical galaxies in hubble s galaxy classification scheme .",
    "it is now clear that ellipticals contain a complex , diverse ism , primarily in the form of hot ( @xmath0k ) , x - ray - emitting gas , with masses @xmath1 m@xmath2 .",
    "small amounts of h@xmath3i , h@xmath4 , ionized gas , and dust have been detected as well in many ellipticals ( _ e.g. _ ,  bregman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    unlike the situation in spiral galaxies ,",
    "physical and evolutionary relationships between the various components of the ism in ellipticals are not yet understood .",
    "a number of theoretical concepts have been developed for the secular evolution of the different components of the ism of ellipticals .",
    "the two currently most popular concepts are _",
    "( i ) _ the `` cooling flow '' picture in which mass loss from stars within the galaxy , heated to @xmath5 k by supernova explosions and collisions between expanding stellar envelopes during the violent galaxy formation stage , quiescently cools and condenses ( cf .  the review of fabian _ et al .",
    "@xcite ) and _ ( ii ) _ the `` evaporation flow '' picture in which clouds of dust and gas have been accreted during post - collapse galaxy interactions . subsequent heating ( and evaporation ) of the accreted gas",
    "is provided by thermal conduction in the hot , x - ray - emitting gas and/or star formation ( cf .",
    "de jong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ; sparks _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the first direct evidence for the common presence of cool ism in ellipticals was presented by jura _",
    "et al . _  ( @xcite ) who used _ iras _ addscans and found that @xmath6% of nearby , bright ellipticals were detected at 60 and 100 .",
    "implied dust masses were of order @xmath7 m@xmath2  ( using h@xmath8 = 50  mpc@xmath9 ) .",
    "interestingly , there are several x - ray - emitting ellipticals with suspected cooling flows ( cf .",
    "forman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) among the _ iras _ detections .",
    "the presence of dust in such objects is surprising , since the lifetime of a dust grain against collisions with hot ions ( `` sputtering '' ) in hot gas with typical pressures @xmath10@xmath11k is only @xmath12 yr ( draine &  salpeter @xcite ) .",
    "what is the origin of this dust , and how is it distributed ?    in order to systematically study the origin and fate of the ism of elliptical galaxies ,",
    "we have recently conducted a deep , systematic optical survey of a complete , blue magnitude - limited sample of 56 elliptical galaxies drawn exclusively from the rsa catalog ( sandage &  tammann @xcite ) .",
    "deep ccd imaging has been performed through both broad - band filters and narrow - band filters isolating the nebular h@xmath13+[n@xmath3ii ]  emission lines .    in this paper",
    "i combine results from this survey with the _ iras _ data to discuss the distribution and origin of dust and gas in ellipticals .",
    "part of this paper is based on goudfrooij & de jong ( @xcite , hereafter paper iv ) .",
    "optical observations are essential for establishing the presence and distribution of dust and gas in ellipticals , thanks to their high spatial resolution .",
    "a commonly used optical technique to detect dust is by inspecting color - index ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xmath14 ) images in which dust shows up as distinct , reddened structures with a morphology different from the smooth underlying distribution of stellar light ( _ e.g. _ ,  goudfrooij _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper ii ) . however , a strong limitation of optical detection methods ( compared to the use of _ iras _ data ) is that only dust distributions that are sufficiently different from that of the stellar light ( _ i.e. _ ,  dust lanes , rings , or patches ) can be detected .",
    "moreover , detections are limited to nearly edge - on dust distributions ( _ e.g. _ ,  no dust lanes with inclinations @xmath15  have been detected , cf .",
    "sadler & gerhard @xcite ; paper ii ) .",
    "thus , the optical detection rate of dust ( currently 41% , cf .",
    "paper ii ) represents a firm lower limit .",
    "since an inclination of 35  is equivalent to about half the total solid angle on the sky , one can expect the _ true _ detection rate to be about twice the measured one ( at a given detection limit for dust absorption ) , which means that _ the vast majority of ellipticals could harbor dust lanes and/or patches_.",
    "optical emission - line surveys of luminous , x - ray - emitting ellipticals have revealed that these galaxies often contain extended regions of ionized gas ( _ e.g. _ ,  trinchieri & di serego alighieri @xcite ) , which have been argued to arise as thermally instable regions in a `` cooling flow '' . as mentioned before , the emission - line regions in these galaxies are suspected to be dust - free in view of the very short lifetime of dust grains .",
    "however , an important result of our optical survey of ellipticals is the finding that emission - line regions are essentially _ always _ associated with substantial dust absorption ( paper ii ; see also macchetto & sparks @xcite ) , which is difficult to account for in the `` cooling flow '' scenario . this dilemma can however be resolved in the `` evaporation flow '' scenario ( de jong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) in which the ism has been accreted from a companion galaxy .",
    "closely related to the origin of the dust and gas is their dynamical state , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  whether or not their motions are already settled in the galaxy potential . this question is , in turn , linked to the intrinsic shape of ellipticals , since in case of a settled dust lane , its morphology indicates a plane in the galaxy in which stable closed orbits are allowed ( _ e.g. _ ,  merritt & de zeeuw @xcite ) .",
    "these issues can be studied best in the inner regions of ellipticals , in view of the short relaxation time scales involved , allowing a direct relation to the intrinsic shape of the parent galaxy .",
    "a recent analysis of properties of _ nuclear _ dust in 64 ellipticals imaged with hst has shown that dust lanes are randomly oriented with respect to the apparent major axis of the galaxy ( van dokkum & franx @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the dust lane is significantly misaligned with the _ kinematic _ axis of the stars for almost all galaxies in their sample for which stellar kinematics are available .",
    "this means that _ even at these small scales _ , the dust and stars are generally dynamically decoupled , which argues for an external origin of the dust .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened by the decoupled kinematics of stars and gas in ellipticals with _",
    "large - scale _ dust lanes ( _ e.g. _ ,  bertola _ et al . _",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , dust in ellipticals has been detected by optical as well as far - ir surveys .",
    "since the optical and far - ir surveys yielded quite similar detection rates , one is tempted to conclude that both methods trace the same component of dust . in this section , this point will be addressed by discussing the distribution of dust in ellipticals .",
    "the methods used for deriving dust masses from optical extinction values and from the iras flux densities at 60 and 100 @xmath16 m , and the limitations involved in these methods , are detailed upon in goudfrooij _",
    "et al . _",
    "( @xcite , hereafter paper iii ) and paper iv .",
    "it is found that the dust masses estimated from the optical extinction are significantly _ lower _ than those estimated from the far - ir emission ( see paper iv ) .",
    "quantitatively , the average ratio @xmath17 = @xmath18 for the galaxies in our `` rsa sample '' for which the presence of dust is revealed by both far - ir emission and optical dust lanes or patches .",
    "i should like to emphasize that this `` dust mass discrepancy '' among ellipticals is quite remarkable , since the situation is _ significantly different _ in the case of spiral galaxies : careful analyses of deep multi - color imagery of dust extinction in spiral galaxies ( _ e.g. _ ,  block _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ; emsellem @xcite ) also reveal a discrepancy between dust masses derived from optical and _ iras _ data , _ but in the other sense , i.e. , _ @xmath19 _ ! _",
    "this can be understood since the _ iras _ measurements were sensitive to `` cool '' dust with temperatures @xmath20k , but much less to `` cold '' dust at lower temperatures which radiates predominantly at wavelengths beyond 100 @xmath16 m ( _ e.g. _ ,  young _ et al . _",
    ". since dust temperatures of order 20 k and lower are appropriate to spiral galaxies ( greenberg & li @xcite and references therein ) , dust masses derived from the _ iras _ data are strict _ lower limits _ by nature .",
    "evidently , the bulk of the dust in spiral disks is too cold to emit significantly at 60 and 100 @xmath16 m , but still causes significant extinction of optical light .",
    "interestingly , @xmath21k is _ also _ appropriate to the outer parts of ellipticals ( cf .",
    "paper iv ) , underlining the significance of the apparent `` dust mass discrepancy '' among ellipticals . what could be the cause ?",
    "_ orientation effects ? _",
    "if the discrepancy would be due to an orientation effect , the ratio @xmath22/@xmath23would be inversely proportional to cos@xmath24 , where @xmath24 is the inclination of the dust lane with respect to the line of sight .",
    "however , we have measured inclinations of regular , uniform dust lanes in ellipticals from images shown in homogeneous optical ccd surveys , and found that the relation between @xmath22/@xmath23  and cos@xmath24 is a scatter plot ( cf.fig .  1 of paper iv ) .",
    "thus , the effect of orientation on the dust mass discrepancy must be weak if present at all .",
    "this suggests that the dust in the lanes is concentrated in dense clumps with a low volume filling factor .    _",
    "diffusely distributed dust ? _   having eliminated the effect of orientation , the most plausible way out of the dilemma of the dust mass discrepancy is to postulate an additional , diffusely distributed component of dust , which is therefore virtually undetectable by optical methods .",
    "we note that this diffuse component of dust is not unexpected : the late - type stellar population of typical giant ellipticals ( @xmath25 l@xmath2 ) has a substantial present - day mass loss rate ( @xmath26 0.1 @xmath27 1 m@xmath2yr@xmath9 of gas and dust ; cf .",
    "faber &  gallagher @xcite ) which can be expected to be diffusely distributed .",
    "an interesting potential way to trace this diffuse component of dust is provided by radial color gradients in ellipticals .",
    "with very few significant exceptions , `` normal '' ellipticals show a global reddening toward their centers , in a sense approximately linear with log(radius ) ( goudfrooij _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i ) and references therein ) .",
    "this is usually interpreted as gradients in stellar metallicity , as metallic line - strength indices show a similar radial gradient ( _ e.g. _ ,  davies _ et al . _",
    "however , compiling all measurements published to date on color- and line - strength gradients within ellipticals shows no obvious correlation ( cf .",
    "[ fig : gradients ] ) , suggesting that an additional process is ( partly ) responsible for the color gradients .",
    "although the presence of dust in ellipticals is now beyond dispute , the implications of dust extinction have been generally discarded in the interpretation of color gradients .",
    "however , recent monte carlo simulations of radiation transfer within ellipticals by witt _",
    "et al . _",
    "( @xcite , hereafter wtc ) and wise & silva have demonstrated that a diffuse distribution of dust throughout ellipticals can cause significant color gradients even with modest dust optical depths .",
    "we have used wtc s `` elliptical '' model to predict dust - induced color gradients appropriate to the far - ir properties of ellipticals in the `` rsa sample '' , as derived from the _ iras _ data .",
    "the model features king profiles for the radial density distributions of both stars and dust : @xmath28^{-\\alpha/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 represents the central density and @xmath30 is the core radius . the `` steepness '' parameter @xmath13 was set to 3 for the stars , and to 1 for the dust [ the reason for the low value of @xmath13 for the dust distribution is that it generates color gradients that are linear with log(@xmath31 ) , as observed ( paper i ; wise & silva @xcite ) ] . using this model , far - infrared - to - blue luminosity ratios and color gradients",
    "have been derived as a function of the total optical depth @xmath32 of the dust ( _ i.e. _ ,  the total dust mass ) .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ iv : lirlbdbidr ] .",
    "it is obvious that color gradients in elliptical galaxies are generally larger than can be generated by a diffuse distribution of dust throughout the galaxies according to the model of wtc .",
    "this is as expected , since color gradients should be partly due to stellar population gradients as well .",
    "however , _ none _ of the galaxies in this sample has a color gradient significantly _ smaller _ than that indicated by the model of wtc .",
    "i argue that this is caused by a `` bottom - layer '' color gradient due to differential extinction , which should be taken seriously in the interpretation of color gradients in ellipticals .",
    "we have checked whether the assumption of the presence of a diffusely distributed component is also _ energetically _ consistent with the available _ iras _ data . to this end , we computed heating rates for dust grains as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "we assumed heating by _",
    "( i ) _ stellar photons , using the radial surface brightness profiles from paper i , and _",
    "( ii ) _ hot electrons in x - ray - emitting gas , if appropriate .",
    "radial dust temperature profiles are derived by equating the heating rates to the cooling rate of a dust grain by far - ir emission .    using the derived radial dust temperature profiles , we reconstructed _ iras _ flux densities for both the optically visible component and the ( postulated ) diffusely distributed component .",
    "apparently regular dust lanes were assumed to by circular disks of uniform density , reaching down to the galaxy nucleus .",
    "after subtracting the contribution of the optically visible component of dust to the _ iras _ flux densities , the resulting flux densities were assigned to the diffuse component . using the wtc model calculations ( cf .",
    "[ iv : lirlbdbidr ] ) , @xmath33/@xmath34 ratios were translated into total optical depths of the dust ( and hence dust mass column densities ) . dividing the dust masses of the diffusely distributed component by the dust mass column densities , outer galactocentric radii for the diffusely distributed dust component",
    "were derived ( typical values were @xmath35 kpc ) .",
    "finally , the _ iras _ flux densities were constructed from the masses of the diffusely distributed component by integrating over spheres ( we refer the reader to paper iv for details ) .    a comparison of the observed and reconstructed _ iras _ flux densities ( cf .",
    "[ fig : compare100 ] ) reveals that the _ observed _ _ iras _ flux densities can _ in virtually all elliptical galaxies in the rsa sample _ be reproduced _ within the 1@xmath36 uncertainties _ by assuming two components of dust in elliptical galaxies :  an optically visible component in the form of dust lanes and/or patches , and a newly postulated dust component which is diffusely distributed within the inner few kpc from the center of the galaxies .",
    "we remind the reader that we have only considered dust which was detected by _ iras _ , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  with @xmath20k .",
    "in reality , the postulated diffuse component of dust in elliptical galaxies may generally be expected to extend out to where the dust temperature is lower .",
    "observations with the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ of the rsa sample of elliptical galaxies are foreseen , and may reveal this cooler dust component in ellipticals .",
