    "a measurement of the total hi content contained in nearby galaxies and hi clouds is an important constraint in the bigger picture of galaxy evolution on cosmological time scales .",
    "although the neutral gas in large galaxies at present is often considered to be a minor component that is used as tracer for kinematics or as a dwindling source of fuel for star formation , there is now strong evidence from the studies of qso absorption lines that the present hi content of the universe is but a fraction of what it was at redshift @xmath0 .",
    "this finding comes from the statistics of the `` damped lyman-@xmath1 '' class of absorption line that is identified with dynamically cold layers akin to the disks of familiar nearby spiral galaxies ( wolfe et al 1986 , lanzetta et al 1995 , storrie - lombardi et al 1996 ) .",
    "figure 1 summarizes the presently available measurements of the neutral gas content as a function of @xmath2 ( storrie - lombardi et al 1996 ) , along side a plot of the incidence of civ absorption lines , which provide an indication of the cross section presented by clouds of ionized , metal - rich gas ( steidel 1990 , bahcall et al 1993 ) , and the comoving density of luminous optically selected qsos ( schmidt et al 1994 , hewett et al 1993 ) .",
    "taken literally , the evidence points to an epoch around @xmath0 when the neutral gas mass density , @xmath3 , hit a maximum , at roughly the same time that the civ cross section for strong absorption lines ( @xmath4  ) began a sharp increase .",
    "this is also a time when luminous qsos were most abundant .",
    "these indicators testify that we are seeing substantial redistribution of gas , as witnessed by the formation of ionized metal - rich galaxy halos and the efficient fueling of active galactic nuclei .",
    "the surge in neutral gas content indicates that protogalactic gravitational potentials were deep enough that gas was confined to sufficiently high density that it was at least momentarily immune to ionization by star bursts and ionizing background radiation .",
    "this may be the epoch that disk galaxies formed as secondary infall of gas occured into galactic potentials formed in the first round of galactic bulge formation .",
    "the disk formation would be accompanied by halo enrichment , either by in situ star formation or by metal pollution of the extended halo region by winds from the new star forming regions of the disk .",
    "an alternative view is that this is also likely to be an epoch when small protogalactic lumps are merging vigorously , and star burst within the lumps would be effective at ejecting metals into an extended region that would at later times constitute the `` halo '' region of the merger product .",
    "figure 1 summarizes only the neutral atomic and ionized gas components .",
    "a complete balance requires an accounting for all the universe s baryons , as gas is exchanged between neutral , ionized , and molecular phases , as well as the path of stellar evolution leading to the current state where far more baryons are contained in stars than in neutral gas . although the present hi content is only @xmath5% of the mass in stars , there was a period at @xmath6 when the hi content apparently was of order half of the present stellar mass .",
    "estimates of the mass content in ionized halos suggest that they probably contain about ten times the mass contained in the damped lyman-@xmath1 absorbers at their peak ( petitjean et al 1993 ) .",
    "this interpretation of the civ data relies on theoretical modeling , with large uncertainties due to ionization level and carbon abundance .",
    "it is striking that the recent hst observations ( bahcall et al 1993 ) are consistent with no evolution in the absorption cross section presented by high column density civ systems from @xmath7 ( steidel 1990 ) to @xmath8 , implying that large quantities of ionized gas may still be present , either in the form of extended halos or in intergalactic clouds whose mass could far exceed the visible stellar mass in galaxies .",
    "the hydrogen neutral fraction of these ionized clouds would provide column densities of h@xmath9 well below the regime ordinarily probed by 21 cm line observations . at present , the integral molecular gas mass content of galaxiers appears to be roughly equal to the neutral atomic mass ( cf .",
    "kennicutt et al 1994 ) .",
    "surveys of nearby volumes in the 21 cm line are important in anchoring the @xmath10 point of figure 1 .",
    "a complete inventory of neutral gas in the nearby universe , of the sort that is being provided by unbiased 21 cm line surveys , will have tight error bars and thus will carry large statistical weight in models that describe the evolution of @xmath3 .",
    "note that the statistical errors of the @xmath11 measurements of @xmath3 are so large that these high @xmath2 points are consistent with no evolution at all . in principle ,",
    "the low @xmath2 regime ( @xmath12 ) of the diagram can be measured using qso absorption line methods in much the same way as the high @xmath2 points . however , the observations are difficult since the lyman-@xmath1 line is not redshifted into the optical window until @xmath13 , so the low @xmath2 absorption line work must be done from space observatories such as iue and hst ( lanzetta et al 1995 , rao et al 1995 ) .    when the data points are plotted as a function of time , as in figure 2 , it is clear that the single low @xmath2 qso absorption line point applies to a time span well longer than half the age of the universe .",
    "several selection effects make it difficult to obtain a reliable sampling of damped lyman-@xmath1 absorbers at low @xmath2 .",
    "cosmological factors , as well as the apparent shrinking of damped lyman-@xmath1 absorption cross section , @xmath14 , with increasing age of the universe ( lanzetta et al 1995 ) , act to make them very rare at recent times : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "there are also selection effects that are likely to influence the qso absorption line measurements and that affect the low @xmath2 measurement most strongly : ( 1 ) the presence of dust in disk galaxies is expected to become increasingly important as they evolve and may act to selectively attenuate the light from qsos behind them , causing these lines of sight to be under represented in qso samples ( fall & pei 1989 , pei & fall 1995 , webster et al 1995 ) although this view is contested ( boyle & di matteo 1995 ) .",
    "( 2 ) gravitational lensing may act to selectively amplify background objects into qso samples , but also may bend the light path so as to dodge the high hi column densities of the disk ( bartelmann & loeb 1996 , smette et al 1995a,1996 ) .",
    "figure 2 includes curves to indicate trends in stellar evolution relative to the decline in @xmath3 with time .",
    "recent analyses of the depletion of the integral mass content of galaxies over cosmological times due to star formation have been presented by lanzetta et al ( 1995 ) and pei and fall ( 1996 ) . a related study by kennicutt et al ( 1994 , ktc ) addresses the prolonging of the current star formation rate in @xmath20 disks due to delayed gas return as stellar populations age .",
    "an example of the ktc models is presented in figure 2 to illustrate both the rise of stellar mass with time and decline of neutral gas content with time for a disk system without added inflow or allowing mass to escape . for this display , the ktc model has been scaled so that the final stellar mass and the final hi mass are consistent with the observations at @xmath20 ; the relative proportion of hi to h@xmath21 has been adjusted for this display to vary linearly with time from @xmath22 at high @xmath2 to 2/3 at the present time .",
    "the slope of the ktc model at the time marked `` now '' in figure 2 can be compared with the steeper slope drawn to indicate the rate at which the current star formation rate would consume the present atomic hydrogen content , exhausting the supply in only @xmath231.5 gyr if there were no additional reservoirs of molecular gas or contribution from delayed stellar return .",
    "the models of lanzetta et al require a balance between the decline of @xmath3 and a rise in stellar mass ; along with assumptions that stellar return occurs instantaneously as each generation of stars is formed , this constrains the mean star formation rate history of the universe .",
    "a consequence is that their models result in an uncomfortably large number of stars at @xmath20 with low metal abundances .",
    "pei and fall suggest that this problem can be solved with a family of dusty models , which imply that the damped lyman-@xmath1 statistics drastically underestimate the integral gas content at all redshifts .",
    "the current generation of radio telescopes are not sensitive enough to resolve this controversy by simply looking back to measure the integral hi content at @xmath24 1/2 . on the other hand , choosing complete samples of radio selected high @xmath2 quasars for background probes would remove possible selection effects by dust .    at @xmath10 ,",
    "recent 21 cm line measurements are indicating that the bulk of the atomic hydrogen content of the nearby universe is bound into galaxies with optical counterparts ( zwaan et al 1996 , schneider 1996 , szomoru et al 1994 , henning 1995 , briggs 1990 ) .",
    "furthermore the normalization of seems to be well understood ( cf .",
    "zwaan et al 1996 , rao & briggs 1993 ) , although there is still concern over the normalization of even the optically determined luminosity function ( cf ellis et al 1996 , glazebrook et al 1995 ) .",
    "clearly the determination of the integral hi content is a measurement that the parkes multibeam survey will clarify since it will be complete , unbiased by extinction and optical surface brightness , and will have well understood sensitivity limits .",
    "another place where future surveys can play an important role will be in exploring lower hi column densities than have been observed in the 21 cm line in the past .",
    "qso absorption line statistics over a wide range of lyman-@xmath1 line strengths specify that the incidence of absorption becomes increasingly prevalent toward lower column densities , so that along a randomly chosen sight line , the probability of interception rises by roughly a factor of 10 for every decrease by a factor of 100 in @xmath26 .",
    "this behavior is quantified by the @xmath27 distribution , defined so that @xmath28 is the number of lines detected within a range @xmath29 centered on @xmath26 over a `` normalized absorption distance '' @xmath30 , where @xmath31 $ ] is the normalized absorption distance from zero redshift to @xmath2 for @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath27 is roughly proportional to @xmath32 over the range @xmath33 to @xmath34 @xmath35 , although there is evidence for subtle structure possibly related to opacity in the lyman continuum that occurs for layers with @xmath36 @xmath35 ( petitjean et al 1993 ) . at high redshift ,",
    "the frequency of absorption for these optically thick absorbers is @xmath37 per unit @xmath38 ( petitjean et al 1993 ) ; for @xmath39 @xmath35 , the frequency is roughly halved .",
    "the derivation of the @xmath27 at these @xmath26 is especially uncertain , since the entire lyman series is heavily saturated in the regime where the lyman continuum is optically thick , and the damping wings , which permit an unambiguous measure of column density , do not become readily observable until @xmath26 is well in excess of 10@xmath40 @xmath35 .",
    "thus , column density measurements in this regime are very uncertain , leading petitjean et al to plot only one point on their @xmath27 diagram for @xmath41 to @xmath42 @xmath35 .",
    "recent large hi surveys with filled aperture telescopes are routinely capable of detecting column densities below @xmath43 @xmath35 ( schneider 1996 , zwaan et al 1996 , briggs et al 1996 ) , provided the emission fills the telescope beam",
    ". the arecibo survey by sorar ( 1994 ; see also briggs & sorar 1996 ) was optimized to be sensitive to @xmath44 @xmath35 ( @xmath45 ) , and the survey observed over 5000 independent beam areas to a depth of 7500 km  s@xmath46 , covering a total absorption path @xmath47 .",
    "the arecibo beam subtends @xmath48  kpc at 3  mpc and 70  kpc at 75  mpc , which is a reasonable match to the cloud sizes deduced for the lyman-@xmath1 forest ( cf .",
    "smette et al 1995b , 1992 ) . to date , only one of the 61 detections ( zwaan et al 1996 ) has not been identified with a high column density layer of the type associated with the neutral intergalactic medium of a galaxy , implying that a separate population of low column density objects can add only a small fraction of the current integral hi content already identified with galaxies .",
    "the high redshift @xmath27 distribution would imply of order 50 interceptions in the range @xmath49 to @xmath43 @xmath35 for the pathlength @xmath38 explored by the arecibo survey .",
    "where are they ? at least a part of the discrepancy is likely due to evolution of lyman-@xmath1 forest cloud population .",
    "an additional observational problem is that the high column density end of the forest cloud distribution ( around 10@xmath50 @xmath35 and above ) has associated metal lines , such as civ and mgii , which has historically caused then to be identified with hypothetical galaxy halos ; single dish observations seldom have the resolution to reliably separate the hi signal from a halo of a spiral galaxy from the bright signal originating in the main body of the galaxy , unless there are strong kinematic effects that create a difference in gas velocity as a function of radius and the halo gas is very extended .",
    "further considerations in the study of this intermediate column density range are the theoretical models that consider ionization of extended gas around galaxies by the extragalactic ionizing background ( sunyaev 1969 , corbelli et al 1989 , maloney 1993 , charlton et al 1994 ) .",
    "many of these models predict a strong dip in @xmath27 between 10@xmath51 and 10@xmath52 @xmath35 . if similar arguments apply to a population of intergalactic clouds or super - lsb galaxies , then an interesting experiment now coming into the realm of possibility will be to push the sensitivity limits of the local hi emission observations down to @xmath53 @xmath35 where ionized layers of high column density might be detected .",
    "some very interesting examples of hi without coincident optical emission have turned up by chance in `` off - scans '' from 21 cm line studies ( schneider 1989 , giovanelli & haynes 1989 , chengalur et al 1995 , giovanelli et al 1995 ) , although all of these detections appear to be associated in some way with nearby visible galaxies .",
    "for example , the protogalaxy of giovanelli & haynes ( 1989 ) now appears in vla observations to more closely resemble a galaxy with tidal remnant ( chengalur et al 1995 ) than a single large cloud .",
    "an interesting consequence of high sensitivity vla surveys of hii galaxies and lsb dwarfs ( taylor et al 1993 ; taylor et al 1996 ) is an apparent increased probability of finding dim hi - rich companions to the hii galaxies as compared with the lsbs .",
    "this kind of study will not be possible with the crude resolution of a single - dish surveys .",
    "the tendency of small galaxies to be found in the vicinity of large ones rather than in isolated regions ( cf .",
    "szomoru et al 1996 ) will complicate the derivation of a hi - mass function that extends to faint masses when survey observations are made with a large beam .",
    "on the other hand , isolated hi clouds ( if they exist ) and hi clouds associated with early type galaxies , such as polar rings and fresh examples of the leo ring ( schneider 1989 ) , should be readily identified if confusion with other galaxies in the same field is not too much of a problem .",
    "large sky surveys in the 21 cm line will improve the measurement of the integral hi content of the universe , and this value will find immediate use in anchoring theories of galaxy evolution . telescopes with large beams will suffer from confusion , which will complicate the determination of the faint end slope of the hi - mass function . the low column density regime with @xmath54 @xmath35 is a new frontier that awaits exploration in the local universe .",
