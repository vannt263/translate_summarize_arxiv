    "low - dimensional magnetic systems are commonly studied due to their interesting magnetic properties . for small spin values ( @xmath5  or  1 ) , the groundstate and the low - lying excitations are often dominated by strong quantum fluctuations , while a more classical behavior is expected for systems with larger spins . up to now",
    "only few low - dimensional magnets containing mn@xmath6 ( d@xmath7 ) with high spin @xmath8 have been studied , _",

    "the magnetic properties can be tailored by the used transition metal ions , _",

    "+ the polyhedral building blocks of the structure are : a 12-fold oxygen coordinated sr forming a distorted cubeoctahedron , a tetrahedrally coordinated v , and a 6-fold coordinated mn displaced from the centre of an octahedron .",
    "the octahedra share edges and constitute quasi-1d chains along the @xmath16 axis , described by the 4@xmath27 screw axis symmetry ( fig . [",
    "fig : structure ] right ) .",
    "the mean distance between the chains is @xmath34    ( @xmath35 ) ( fig .",

    "the alkaline - earth site ( @xmath12 ) in srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 and bamn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 seems to play an important role considering the crystal symmetry . comparing the @xmath12-o bond distances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polhyhedra ] ) it is apparent , that sr is too small for the site .",
    "the sr - o bond lengths are in the range @xmath36    and result in a bond valence sum ( bvs ) of @xmath37 ( ba : + 2.12 ) .",
    "sr is displaced in its cubeoctahedral environment almost reaching a coordination of ten , whereas the larger ba is found almost in the center .",
    "according to bvs calculation , the formal oxidation states of mn are @xmath38 for srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 and + 2.32 for bamn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the notable deviations from the expected values , @xmath39 for both ions , indicate a covalent contribution to the bonding character .",

    "in addition , the @xmath40 unit cell parameter and , hence , the mean interchain distance is significantly shorter in srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 ( 6.2309   ) than in bamn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 ( 6.2781   ) . the shorter interchain distance might result in a stronger interchain coupling .       of srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 for a magnetic field of 1",

    "[ fig : mchipaper ] .",
    "both measurements have been done for field directions parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic @xmath16 axis , which is the direction of the mn - o chains .",
    "however , @xmath44 and @xmath13 show a nearly isotropic behavior . as the mn@xmath6 ion with @xmath45 configuration has a total angular momentum @xmath46 with a high spin of @xmath8 ,",
    "srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 is a heisenberg system , where only weak anisotropies are expected .",
    "a broad maximum in @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mchipaper]a ) centered around 200  k is observed for temperatures above t@xmath42 ( compared to 170  k in bamn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite ) confirming that the magnetic system is low dimensional , as expected from the crystal structure .",
    "below t@xmath42 the susceptibility shows a slight increase , which is typical for the transverse susceptibility @xmath47 of an antiferromagnet .",
    "the fact that the same @xmath47 and @xmath48 are found for both , a magnetic field applied perpendicular or parallel to the tetragonal @xmath16 axis of srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 , means that a possible spin - flop field is extremely small or , in other words , the mn@xmath6 spins are practically isotropic . in the magnetization ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mchipaper]b ) a linear increase is observed for higher fields , as expected for a canting of the moments in transverse fields well below the saturation field . in the maximum field of 7  t ,",
    "only 0.2  @xmath49 are observed , which correspond to only 2  % of the fully polarized magnetization of 10  @xmath49 .",
    "this agrees with a dominant antiferromagnetic coupling in srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the lack of magnetic hysteresis negates ferro or ferri contributions to the ordered magnetic state in the main phase .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : mchipaper]a shows @xmath44 in low magnetic fields . here , a second anomaly is observed close to 47  k , which is fully suppressed already at fields above 300  mt .",
    "the disappearance of the 47  k anomaly suggests a possible ferromagnetic component , most likely originating from a magnetic impurity phase . from a comparison of the magnetic moments in different fields and the s - shaped low - field magnetization curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mchipaper]b ) the amount of oriented moments and , hence , of the impurity phase can be roughly estimated to about 1  % .",
    "two natural impurity candidates are mn@xmath10o@xmath50 ( hausmannite ) @xcite and mno @xcite .",
    "mn@xmath10o@xmath50 orders ferrimagnetically at 42  k , which is too small to explain the 47  k anomaly .",
    "mno is an antiferromagnet with t@xmath51  k , but shows weak ferromagnetism as a nanoparticle with transition temperatures around 20  k @xcite .",
    "therefore it is difficult to identify one of these candidates as the measured impurity .          in specific heat data only one anomaly",
    "is observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hc ] ) .",
    "this coincides with the lower transition observed in the magnetic susceptibility around 43  k. the shape of this peak suggests a second - order phase transition , which is expected for a magnetic ordering . in an applied magnetic field",
    "the peak is slightly shifted to higher temperatures ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : hc ] ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath4 amounts to about 70  mk / t and is in qualitative agreement with an estimation via the ehrenfest relation @xmath52 , which relates the field dependence of the nel temperature to the respective anomalies observed in magnetization and specific heat at @xmath4 .",
    "on decreasing temperature the slope @xmath53 changes from positive to negative at @xmath4 , whereas the specific heat increases : thus , a positive field dependence of the transition temperature is expected .",
    "note , that the 47  k anomaly observed in @xmath43 for the lowest fields has no counterpart in the zero - field specific - heat data , what further confirms that this anomaly is no bulk feature of srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "large single crystals of the new compound srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 were successfully grown by the floating - zone technique . from crystal structure ,",
    "susceptibility , magnetization , and heat capacity measurements it is clear that srmn@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 belongs to the quasi-1d spin-5/2 antiferromagnets . the relatively high antiferromagnetic transition temperature around 43",
    "k may be due to the relatively strong intra- and/or interchain magnetic coupling in the system .",
