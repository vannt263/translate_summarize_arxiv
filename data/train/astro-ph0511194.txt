    "@xcite attributed the production of the isotopes heavier than the iron group to three processes of nucleosynthesis , the @xmath10- and @xmath11-processes of neutron addition , and the @xmath0-process of proton addition .",
    "the conditions they specified for the @xmath0-process , proton densities @xmath13 g @xmath14 and temperatures @xmath15 k , were difficult to realize in nature and so other processes and sites were sought . @xcite and @xcite attributed the production of the @xmath0-process nuclei to photodisintegration , a series of ( @xmath16n ) , ( @xmath16p ) and ( @xmath17 ) reactions flowing downward through radioactive proton - rich progenitors from lead to iron .",
    "their `` @xmath7-process '' operated upon previously existing @xmath11-process seed in the star to make the @xmath0-process , and was thus `` secondary '' in nature ( or even `` tertiary '' since the @xmath11-process itself is secondary ) .",
    "it could only happen in a star made from the ashes of previous stars that had made the @xmath11-process .",
    "arnould suggested hydrostatic oxygen burning in massive stars as the site where the necessary conditions were realized ; woosley and howard , who discovered the relevant nuclear flows independently , discussed explosive oxygen and neon burning in a type ii supernova as the likely site . over the years",
    ", increasingly refined calculations showed that a portion of the @xmath0-nuclei could actually be produced as woosley and howard described ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a nagging deficiency of @xmath0-process production in the mass range a = 92 - 124 still persisted though .",
    "the production of @xmath1mo posed a particular problem since , unless the star had previously experienced a strong @xmath11-process , enhancing the abundance of seed above a = 95 , there simply was not enough seed . in massive stars",
    "the @xmath11-process does not go above mass 90 and so the necessary seed enhancement does not occur .",
    "@xcite found that large abundances of some @xmath0-nuclei , and @xmath18mo in particular , could be synthesized in the neutrino - powered wind blowing from a young neutron star ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . while this wind had chiefly been seen as a way of making the @xmath10-process @xcite , for electron mole numbers , @xmath19 , the @xmath0-nuclei @xmath20zn , @xmath21se , @xmath22kr , @xmath23sr , and @xmath18mo",
    "were produced in great abundance .",
    "it is important to note in this regard that , while @xmath24 is nominally neutron rich ( @xmath25 = 0.5 corresponds to neutron , proton equality ) , it is still a lot more proton - rich than the @xmath0-nuclei themselves ( z / n for @xmath18mo = 0.457 ) , so the nucleonic gas contained some free protons .",
    "the @xmath0-nuclei here were also primary , in the sense that a star with no initial metallicity would still make the same composition in its neutrino wind .",
    "there were potential problems , however , in that the ejection of only a small amount of mass with @xmath25 just a little lower than 0.485 resulted in disastrous overproduction of n = 50 nuclei like @xmath26sr , @xmath27y , and @xmath28zr .",
    "also the neutron - rich wind failed to produce adequate amounts of p - process nuclei above a = 92 . though this paper focuses on early proton - rich outflows , the sn model we study",
    "is calculated to eject a sizable amount of neutron - rich material .",
    "it remains to be seen if very recent simulations predict neutron - rich outflows that satisfy the conditions needed for efficient synthesis of @xmath18mo , or if neutrino interactions facilitate production of @xmath29 in the neutron rich ejecta predicted by these models @xcite .",
    "based upon calculations by jim wilson , @xcite pointed out that @xmath25 in the wind would naturally evolve though the points necessary to make these @xmath0-nuclei and would actually start with a value greater than 0.5 .",
    "as other detailed models for core - collapse supernovae became available , nucleosynthesis was explored in this `` hot , proton - rich bubble '' by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the latter two studies found substantial production of nuclei up to a = 84 , including some nuclei traditionally attributed to the @xmath0-process .",
    "it seems probable that these winds have also contributed appreciably to the solar abundances of @xmath30sc , @xmath31ti and @xmath20zn , and , possibly in a measurable way , to other rare abundances in metal poor stars .",
    "however , since these same nuclei were already made by other processes @xcite , there seemed to be no clear diagnostic of the proton - rich wind .    here ,",
    "following the suggestion of @xcite , we have revisited our calculations of the proton - rich wind including , in addition to the proton captures , the effect of a neutron flux created by p(@xmath5n .",
    "these neutrons have the effect of bridging the long - lived isotopes along the path of the @xmath6-process by ( n , p ) reactions and accelerating the flow to heavier elements . for our standard assumptions regarding expansion rate and neutrino fluxes",
    "@xcite , we find substantial production of @xmath0-process nuclei up to pd , whereas previously the heaviest major production was zn .",
    "if the entropy of the expansion is artificially increased by a factor of 3 to account for extra energy deposition in the wind @xcite , magnetic confinement @xcite , or alfvn wave dissipation @xcite , the production of @xmath0-nuclei extends up to a = 170 .",
    "interestingly , the relevant conditions , @xmath32 g @xmath14 and t = @xmath33 k resemble those originally proposed for the @xmath0-process by b@xmath34fh .",
    "key differences , however , are that all the species produced here are primary and the process occurs on a shorter time scale - just a few seconds - owing to the `` effective '' acceleration of weak decays by ( n , p ) reactions .",
    "our fiducial model for exploring nucleosynthesis in the proton - rich wind is the explosion of a 15@xmath35m@xmath36 star @xcite",
    ". an earlier paper ( * ? ? ? * henceforth paper i ) studied nucleosynthesis in this same model but did not account for the influence of neutrino interactions .",
    "the present study includes charged - current capture on free nucleons @xcite and neutral - current spallation of nucleons from alpha particles @xcite .",
    "many other details of the supernova model and associated nuclear - network calculations relevant to this work can be found in paper i.    the ejecta of the deepest layers of the supernova can be divided into two categories - hot bubble ejecta and winds .",
    "material in the hot bubble originates from a region outside the neutron star that is driven convectively unstable by neutrino heating .",
    "this material does not have to escape the deep gravitational well found at the neutron star surface . as a result",
    ", modest conditions characterize these outflows : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "winds originate from the surface of the neutron star and are pushed outwards along gentle pressure gradients caused by neutrino heating @xcite .",
    "these outflows have relatively high entropies ( @xmath39 ) , high electron fractions ( @xmath25 as large as 0.57 ) , and short initial expansion timescales .",
    "tables 2 & 3 in paper i provide a brief summary of initial conditions in different bubble and wind trajectories .    in the absence of neutrinos ,",
    "very little synthesis occurs in the early proton - rich outflows for nuclei heavier than a= 64 . compared to observed solar abundances , proton - rich winds that are not subject to a neutrino fluence are copious producers of @xmath30sc and @xmath40 .",
    "bubble trajectories , on the other hand , tend to favor the synthesis of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and some co or ni isotopes .",
    "the nuclear flow stops at @xmath20ge for two reasons : the long weak decay lifetime ( with respect to the expansion timescale of the neutrino winds ) of this and other even - z even - n waiting point nuclei and the small q values for proton capture on these nuclei .",
    "the simulations of @xcite followed the explosion of the supernova in 2 dimensions until about 450 ms after core bounce . at this time",
    ", typical temperatures in the bubble trajectories were around 4 billion degrees . at the end of the 2d simulation",
    "the sn was mapped onto a 1d grid .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the sn , including winds emitted by the neutron star , was followed until about 1300 ms after core bounce . at this last time typical asymptotic temperatures in the early wind were just over 2 billion degrees .",
    "since most of the interesting nucleosynthesis occurs for @xmath43 , it is necessary to extrapolate outflow conditions to later times .",
    "details of the extrapolation were described in paper i which considered two estimates . in the first , the expansion already calculated is assumed to continue homologously with no deceleration .",
    "this gives a useful lower bound on the expansion timescale .",
    "however , in reality the outflow will quickly catch up to the outgoing shock .",
    "it is more reasonable then to assume that escaping matter enters a phase where it moves with the shock speed .",
    "conditions for this can be estimated from 1d supernova simulations .    for the present paper",
    "we focus on the more realistic extrapolation that mimics the late time slowing of the wind .",
    "the temperature and density evolution was extrapolated as in paper i. specifically , the trajectories found by @xcite were smoothly merged with those calculated for the inner zone of the same @xmath44 star by @xcite . to avoid discontinuities in the entropy at the time where the two calculations were matched the density in the previous 1d calculation",
    "was changed to match that in the trajectories found by janka et al .",
    "our procedure likely leads to an underestimate of the expansion timescale at late times because the explosion energy and shock velocity in the calculations of woosley & weaver were somewhat larger than in the more recent 2d simulations .    in order to include the influence of the neutrinos from the cooling neutron star additional assumptions",
    "are needed . for the neutrino temperatures and luminosities we used the same values calculated at approximately 1 second in the simulation of @xcite .",
    "these values are shown in table [ nutable ] and are assumed to remain constant .",
    "this may be a questionable assumption - neutrino spectra actually harden and their luminosities fall as the neutron star shrinks .",
    "however , it is estimated that uncertainties in the extrapolation of trajectories to low temperatures are greater than uncertainties arising from our simple treatment of the neutrino spectral evolution .    to obtain the integrated neutrino exposure seen by outflowing material ,",
    "it is also necessary to make assumptions about the evolution of the radial velocity . in all cases",
    ", it was assumed that the radial velocity at times greater than those followed in the simulations was constant at @xmath45 .",
    "this is close to the velocity of the outgoing shock in the 2d calculation of this fairly low energy explosion .",
    "again , there may be some inconsistency between our treatment of the late time expansion and our adopted asymptotic radial velocity .",
    "a more sophisticated approach might scale the expansion time estimated from the calculations of woosley & weaver to reflect the relatively small shock velocity found in the 2d simulations .",
    "it is shown in section [ modest ] that our calculations for nucleosynthesis are relatively insensitive to changes in the late - time outflow velocity .",
    "figure [ allfig ] shows results of our calculations that include neutrino captures for production factors characterizing nucleosynthesis in proton - rich outflows leaving the early sn .",
    "the production factor for an isotope @xmath46 is defined here as @xmath47 in this equation , the sum is over all trajectories , @xmath48 is the mass fraction of nuclide @xmath46 in the @xmath49th trajectory , @xmath50 is the mass fraction of nuclide @xmath46 in the sun @xcite , @xmath51 is the mass in the @xmath49th trajectory , and @xmath52 is the total mass ejected in the sn explosion .",
    "the lower panel in figure [ allfig ] shows production factors characterizing nucleosynthesis in just the hot bubble .",
    "this is comprised of the 40 trajectories described in table 1 of paper i. by comparing with table 5 from paper i we see that nucleosynthesis in the bubble material is not greatly changed when neutrino captures are included .",
    "this is because the bubble material is far from the neutron star and experiences few neutrino captures relative to the number of seed nuclei in this low entropy environment .",
    "the story is much different for the early wind shown in the middle panel of figure [ allfig ] .",
    "this wind is comprised of the 6 trajectories defined in table 2 of paper i. in these outflows , neutrinos convert free protons into neutrons .",
    "capture of these neutrons by ( n , p ) reactions on long - lived nuclei along the path of the @xmath6-process accelerate the progress to nuclei as heavy as pd .",
    "final conditions for these wind trajectories are provided in table [ 5512570_final ] .",
    "we defer a discussion of the nuclear flows and the potential for production of heavier elements to section [ broaderstudy ] .    for comparison",
    ", we also show , in figure [ allfignoneutrinos ] , the integrated results ( summed over the same six wind trajectories ) of calculations that do _ not _ include neutrino capture on protons .",
    "apart from the neglect of neutrinos the trajectories studied here are identical to those described in the middle panel of figure [ allfig ] .",
    "the differences are dramatic .",
    "when neutrino captures are ignored nucleosynthesis stops some 40 mass units lower than when they are included .",
    "the calculations in the previous section are quite uncertain owing to both an uncertainty in the supernova explosion model and to our procedure for extrapolating expansion after the explosion calculation has stopped .",
    "modest alterations are reasonable to the asymptotic wind velocity , the electron fraction of the wind , and neutrino capture rates in the outflow .",
    "more extreme changes that might reflect the influence of novel physical processes operating in the early wind are explored in section [ broaderstudy ] .",
    "* influence of a larger asymptotic wind velocity + the supernova studied by janka et al . has a relatively low kinetic energy at infinity , 0.6@xmath53 erg .",
    "more energetic explosions would give rise to shock velocities larger than the @xmath54 adopted here . to estimate nucleosynthesis in more energetic supernovae",
    ", we show in the first column of table [ modesttable ] production factors for nuclei synthesized in a wind characterized by an asymptotic velocity of @xmath55 .",
    "this is more typical of supernovae with late time kinetic energies near @xmath56 erg .",
    "apart from the increase in asymptotic velocity all other properties of the 6 trajectories comprising the early wind were kept unchanged from those found by simulation . + by comparing with the middle panel of figure [ allfig ]",
    ", one sees that changing the asymptotic outflow velocity has little effect on nucleosynthesis",
    ". this may be partly an artifact of our definition of `` asymptotic '' as applying only to times after the last point given by the supernova simulation .",
    "to test this we also ran simulations where the outflow velocity was set to @xmath55 once the temperature of the wind fell below 2.5 billion degrees . again",
    "the differences were small .",
    "* effect of 5@xmath57 changes to @xmath25 + uncertainty in the neutrino spectral evolution or the dynamics of the wind near the neutron star could affect @xmath25 in the wind .",
    "the second and third columns of table [ modesttable ] show the influence of changing the electron fraction up or down by @xmath58 .",
    "this change was applied to all 6 trajectories comprising the early wind .",
    "other characteristics of these trajectories were left unchanged . + it is evident that relatively small changes to the electron fraction can have a big impact on nucleosynthesis . if @xmath25 is decreased by 5@xmath57 production of @xmath0-isotopes near mass 100 is lost and replaced by modest synthesis of some proton - rich kr and sr isotopes .",
    "a 5@xmath57 increase in @xmath25 leads to large production of pd and cd isotopes .",
    "the reason for the large impact of changing @xmath25 can be understood in terms of the number of protons available for capturing neutrinos .",
    "the most proton - rich trajectory found by simulations had @xmath59 .",
    "this corresponds to a mass fraction of free protons @xmath60 .",
    "increasing @xmath25 by five percent corresponds to a 40 percent increase in @xmath61 .",
    "* changes to the neutrino capture rates + the last two columns of table [ modesttable ] show the influence of halving and doubling the luminosity of electron neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "such large changes to the luminosities are probably unlikely , but might reflect plausible uncertainties in the local neutrino capture rate experienced by the wind . for example , the wind material might first catch up with the outgoing shock at a larger radius than found by simulations .",
    "our neglect of the temporal evolution and finer spectral details of the neutrinos might also result in modest changes to the capture rates .",
    "+ from table [ modesttable ] it is seen that halving or doubling the charged current neutrino captures rates is roughly equivalent to decreasing or increasing @xmath25 by 5@xmath57 .",
    "galactic chemical evolution studies indicate that production factors in the whole star for isotopes exclusively produced in core - collapse supernovae must be of order 10 @xcite . as noted before @xcite",
    ", this implies that the current simulations predict a hot bubble ejecta that could explain the origin of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "implications for the early wind are more interesting . without any tuning or rescaling of wind conditions , the simulations of @xcite",
    "predict a wind that efficiently synthesizes several interesting @xmath0-nuclei - including the elusive isotopes @xmath62 and @xmath63 - in near solar relative proportions .",
    "overall these predict about 5 - 10 times too much yield of the most proton - rich stable ru and pd isotopes . in the previous section",
    "it was shown that small and plausible changes to the electron fraction can alleviate this overproduction .",
    "in this section we consider nucleosynthesis in outflows for which neutrino , proton , and neutron - induced reactions on heavy seed can produce still heavier nuclei .",
    "this may occur because the proton to seed ratio is higher - as happens if the entropy is higher - or the production of neutrons by p(@xmath64n is greater .",
    "reasons why the entropy might be higher are discussed in the conclusions .",
    "qualitatively , the nucleosynthesis we are describing occurs in three , or possibly four stages .",
    "first , in the outgoing wind , all neutrons combine with protons leaving an excess of unbound protons - much like in the big bang .",
    "as this combination of alphas and protons cools below @xmath65 k , a small fraction of the alphas recombine to produce nuclei in and slightly above the iron group - @xmath66ni , @xmath67zn , and @xmath20ge . flow beyond @xmath20ge",
    "is inhibited however by strong reverse flows , especially ( p,@xmath4 ) reactions .",
    "the second stage occurs as the temperature declines below @xmath68 k. a combination of ( p,@xmath69 and ( n , p ) reactions carries the flow , still close to the z = n line , to heavier nuclei . for a@xmath7092",
    "the flow in the present calculations passes through the even - even n = z nuclei .",
    "after @xmath71 ( @xmath26ru ) the character of the flow changes .",
    "effective synthesis of the next even - even nucleus ( @xmath18pd ) is prevented in part by the small proton separation energy of @xmath72rh - the proton capture parent of @xmath18pd .",
    "as in the analogous @xmath10-process , just how far the flow goes in a particular trajectory depends on the proton - to - seed ratio and especially on the number of neutrons per seed produced by p(@xmath64n . all interesting nuclei in this stage",
    "are made as proton - rich progenitors .",
    "the third stage occurs as the temperature drops below @xmath73 k and charged - particle reactions freeze out .",
    "neutrons are still being produced by p(@xmath64n , however , albeit at a reduced rate ( both because the neutrino luminosity declines and the distance to the neutron star is getting greater ) .",
    "( n , p ) reactions now drive material towards the valley of beta stability . because the nuclei involved are unstable to positron decay anyway , this only accelerates the inevitable .",
    "the atomic mass , a , does not change",
    ". it should be noted , however , that just as the @xmath10-process can contribute to nuclei made by the @xmath11-process that are unshielded against @xmath74 decay of more neutron - rich isobars , so too can the @xmath75 process considered here contribute to @xmath11-nuclei that are unshielded on the proton - rich side .",
    "that is , in addition to nuclei that are designated as `` @xmath76 '' , there may also be nuclei one should consider as `` @xmath77 '' .",
    "the fourth stage only occurs in the most extreme situation where the number of neutrons produced by neutrinos is quite large compared with the number of seed nuclei .",
    "then ( n , p ) reactions not only carry the flow at low temperature back to the valley of beta stability , but ( n,@xmath7 ) reactions carry it beyond - _ to the neutron rich side of the periodic chart _ , even in the presence of a large abundance of free protons .",
    "this is a novel version of the @xmath10-process that actually works best when the _ proton _ abundance is large but the temperature too low for proton addition .",
    "the protons are just a source of neutrons .",
    "the most interesting part of the nucleosynthesis occurs during the later stages of the outflow as the material cools . in the absence of an important neutrino flux",
    "the final isotopic yields are determined by an interplay between @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 processes as well as details of how these reactions fall out of equilibrium .",
    "when neutrino capture on free protons is important , nuclei are pushed to higher isospin and mass via @xmath82 and ( n,@xmath7 ) reactions .    as a first approximation neutrinos will be important if they create an appreciable number of neutrons per heavy nucleus .",
    "the ratio of created free neutrons to heavy nuclei is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the mass fraction of elements heavier than @xmath4 particles and @xmath85 is an effective average atomic number . in eq .",
    "[ yneq ] @xmath86 is the net number of neutrinos captured per free proton at temperatures smaller than about @xmath87k . here",
    "@xmath88 is the rate at which each free proton captures @xmath89 s @xcite . in eq .",
    "[ lambdanu ] @xmath90 is the luminosity of electron anti - neutrinos , @xmath91 is an effective temperature for these neutrinos and @xmath10 is the radius of the material from the neutrino sphere .    to estimate the relation between @xmath78 and nucleosynthesis consider a mass element of unit volume co - moving with the wind .",
    "the number of free protons in this mass element is @xmath92 these free protons are destroyed by anti - neutrino capture at a rate @xmath93 neutrons created when anti - neutrinos capture onto protons are subsequently absorbed by nuclei .",
    "the evolution of the free neutron abundance is then set by a competition between neutrino and nuclear processes @xmath94 here the sum is over all isotopes @xmath46 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 represent the atomic number and rate at which species @xmath46 absorbs free neutrons . as a matter of convention @xmath96 here represents the rate at which a single atom of species @xmath46 absorbs neutrons when the free neutron density is one mol per unit volume . if we introduce an average neutron absorption rate @xmath97 the destruction rate appearing on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ xndot ] can be written @xmath98    neutrons are principally absorbed in ( n , p ) and @xmath99 reactions , with @xmath100 reactions playing a smaller role ( due to the larger coulomb barrier in the exit channel ) .",
    "table [ reprates ] shows rates for a sample of nuclei found in proton - rich outflows . at 2 billion degrees typical values of @xmath96 for even - even proton - drip line nuclei ( those bordering the line separating the proton - bound nuclei from the proton - unbound nuclei ) with mass near a@xmath10172 are around @xmath102 .",
    "this implies a very rapid neutron destruction rate .",
    "for example , at a typical density of @xmath103 g @xmath14 and a mass fraction of heavy nuclei equal to @xmath104 , a neutron is absorbed in less than a microsecond . since this is much shorter than the material expansion rate it is fair to treat the neutron abundance as being in equilibrium @xmath105 an estimate for the abundance of free neutrons",
    "also gives an estimate for the destruction rate of an atom of species @xmath46 : @xmath106 here we have defined an effective destruction rate that reflects the competition between different nuclear species for scarce neutrons @xmath107 which is enormous .",
    "this equation says for plausible outflow conditions a given species can be entirely destroyed by neutrino - produced neutrons in times as short as @xmath108 ms .",
    "it also implies a very small equilibrium neutron abundance : @xmath109 for @xmath110 g @xmath14 .",
    "one of the most interesting questions relates to how high in mass the nucleosynthesis will proceed . for the purpose of making first estimates",
    "we can suppose the starting inventory of nuclei to be concentrated near mass 60 .",
    "we will also suppose that @xmath96 is independent of species for nuclei with @xmath111 . in this case",
    "the number of neutrons captured by a heavy nucleus is just @xmath78 . a more careful treatment of @xmath96 is not presented since results from detailed network - based calculations are given in the next section . with the above assumptions the mass fraction of species @xmath49 is @xmath112 here we have defined a species to include all nuclei of a given isotone . depending on just how fast the effective absorption rates @xmath113 are one might or might not suppose that decay of nuclei with odd - n is dominated by weak processes .",
    "this is because odd - n drip - line nuclei can have rather fast @xmath81 rates ( see table [ reprates ] ) .",
    "when the neutron absorption rates are slower than these weak rates one would take @xmath114 in the above equation .",
    "though eq .",
    "[ howhigh ] is crude it can be used as a rough guide to gauge the influence of free neutrons created from neutrino captures . as an example , suppose one neutron is created per heavy nucleus ( @xmath115 ) . in this case eq .",
    "[ howhigh ] suggests that the relative mass fraction of nuclei that have captured a single neutron is about @xmath116 , while the relative mass fraction of nuclei that have captured 4 neutrons is about 20 times smaller .",
    "if we use a factor of ten decrease in mass fraction as a rough cutoff , this implies that an appreciable abundance of nuclei with mass up to a@xmath117 will be synthesized .",
    "here we have supposed that a unit increase in neutron number is accompanied by a unit increase in proton number .",
    "neutron capture on odd - n proton - drip line nuclei has been neglected since the @xmath81 rates of these nuclei are much faster than the assumed neutron capture rate of @xmath118sec .",
    "as another example , suppose that @xmath119 . in this case",
    "the relative mass fraction of nuclei that have captured 5 neutrons is about 20/@xmath120 , while the relative mass fraction of nuclei that have captured 11 neutrons is about 20 times smaller .",
    "this suggests appreciable synthesis of nuclei up to mass @xmath121 .",
    "here we have again assumed that the change in atomic number is twice the change in neutron number and that weak processes alone destroy odd - n nuclei .",
    "these assumptions probably lead to an overestimate for the increase in @xmath122 in this case because a neutron capture rate of @xmath123sec is comparable to the weak rates of many proton drip - line nuclei .",
    "the above considerations suggest a first constraint on conditions synthesizing @xmath0-nuclei with mass near 130 @xmath124 a second constraint comes from considering the evolution of the outflow at low temperatures .",
    "as @xmath125 falls below about 1.5@xmath126k charged - particle capture rates begin to freeze out .",
    "neutrons , on the other hand , are still rapidly absorbed .",
    "these neutron captures push the flow toward stability and away from progenitors of @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "if low - temperature neutrino - induced neutron production is significant , even the very neutron - rich @xmath10-process nuclei are synthesized .",
    "minimal destruction of @xmath0-nuclei implies a second constraint @xmath127 conversely , efficient synthesis of @xmath10-process isotopes in these proton - rich outflows requires the production of several neutrons per heavy nucleus at low temperatures .",
    "outflows characterized by the production of many free neutrons per heavy nucleus ( large @xmath78 ) can be realized in different ways .",
    "for example , the timescale characterizing the expansion of the outflow around the time that @xmath4-particles are synthesized might be small , the flow might be held close to the neutron star for an extended period , or @xmath25 might be very large . for simplicity",
    "we consider implications of changing the entropy of the outflow .",
    "apart from the influence of neutrino captures occurring at low temperature , the precise mechanism by which @xmath78 is increased is not so important for nucleosynthesis .",
    "changes to the entropy of the hot bubble are not considered .",
    "neutrino capture is not very pronounced in this portion of the outflow .",
    "as well , the hot bubble material does not begin close to the neutron star , so it is hard to see how an appreciable increase in the entropy of this material could be achieved .",
    "figure [ 2sfig ] shows the influence of doubling the entropy in the early wind . like the middle panel of figure [ allfig ] ,",
    "this figure gives integrated production factors for a wind comprised of six trajectories .",
    "each of these trajectories has twice the entropy , but is otherwise identical to , a counterpart trajectory from the simulation . for definiteness",
    "the increase in entropy was assumed to influence only the density evolution .",
    "the evolution of temperature with time was assumed to be the same as that found from simulation .",
    "to a fair approximation doubling or tripling of the entropy corresponds to dividing the density by a factor of two or three .",
    "doubling the entropy in the early wind results in values of @xmath78 ranging from about 0.6 to 10 .",
    "the increased number of neutron captures results in efficient synthesis of nuclei as heavy as mass 125 .",
    "by contrast , for all of the unmodified wind trajectories @xmath78 is less than about 3 and efficient synthesis stops around ru .",
    "figure [ 3sfig ] shows the influence of tripling the entropy in the early wind .",
    "again - this shows integrated production factors for six trajectories that each have larger entropy , but that are otherwise identical to , unaltered trajectories described by the middle panel of figure [ allfig ] .",
    "these modified high entropy wind trajectories have values of @xmath78 ranging from about 1 to 22 .",
    "this results in efficient synthesis of nuclei as heavy as mass 170 .",
    "in other words , increasing the number of neutrons captured per heavy nucleus by 10 pushes the flow some 40 units higher in mass .",
    "though outflows predicted by simulations have values of @xmath78 that are too small to allow synthesis of @xmath128 @xmath0-nuclei , they naturally satisfy the constraint ( eq .  [ con2 ] ) on the relative number of neutrino captures occurring while the wind material is so cold that charged particle captures have frozen out .",
    "figure [ ev1 ] shows the evolution of @xmath129 as a function of temperature for the wind outflow characterized by @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "it is seen that the fraction of neutrino captures occurring at low temperatures smaller than 1.5 billion degrees is quite small , less than about @xmath58 .    to illustrate",
    "the influence of neutrino captures occurring while the outflow is cold enough that charged particle reactions have frozen out we modified the entropy doubled version of trajectory 6 ( table [ 5512570_final ] ) to be held close to the neutron star at temperatures less than 1.5 billion degrees . a relatively modest modification in the outflow results in the capture of about 5 neutrons per heavy nucleus at temperatures lower than @xmath132k .",
    "the first four columns of table [ slowcompare ] shows a comparison between nucleosynthesis in this slow outflow and nucleosynthesis in an outflow with the nominal radial velocity of @xmath133 .",
    "since the only difference between these two trajectories is the evolution of radius with time at low temperatures , all differences in nucleosynthesis arise from late - time neutron production .",
    "it is seen that a couple of neutrons produced at the wrong time can be detrimental to the synthesis of some @xmath0-process isotopes .",
    "we also show in table [ slowcompare ] the influence of a great number of neutrons produced at low temperatures . again ,",
    "this was studied by modifying just the radial profile at temperatures less than 1.5 billion degrees of the entropy doubled version of trajectory 6 .",
    "the last two columns of the table show nucleosynthesis in this trajectory in which about 20 free neutrons are created per heavy nucleus at low temperatures .",
    "most of the isotopes shown are @xmath10-process isotopes .",
    "it is perhaps remarkable that the 2nd and possibly 3rd @xmath10-process peak elements can be synthesized in these proton - rich environments .",
    "it may be difficult , however , to have ejecta that are both cold enough and close enough to the neutron star to experience the necessary neutrino irradiation .      in all trajectories studies , regardless of initial electron fraction or entropy ,",
    "nucleosynthesis begins with @xmath134c produced early on by the reaction sequence @xmath4(@xmath4n,@xmath7)@xmath135be(@xmath4,n)@xmath134c . by the time t@xmath136 the iron group has already been assembled .",
    "strong @xmath137 and pairs of ( p,@xmath7 ) and ( @xmath4,p ) reactions continue to populate the even - z even - n @xmath4-nuclei up to @xmath66ni and @xmath67zn .",
    "the flow mostly travels along the z = n line and does not stray more than two neutrons from it for any element up to zinc .",
    "this continues until the charged - particle reactions freeze out ( t@xmath138 ) .",
    "characteristics of the nucleosynthesis at lower temperatures depends sensitively on the influence of neutrino captures .",
    "to illustrate the influence of p(@xmath139n reactions we begin with a discussion of nucleosynthesis in trajectory 6 , which is characterized by the weak production of a few neutrons per heavy nucleus .",
    "important nuclear flows occurring when material in this trajectory has a temperature @xmath140k are shown in figure [ j570_s1_psp_zn2sn ] .",
    "it is seen that the dominant flows ( red arrows ) are due to proton - capture ( p,@xmath7 ) reactions .",
    "these can proceed until a proton unbound ( denoted by a white square ) or small ( blue ) @xmath141 energy is encountered .",
    "unlike the @xmath6-process , here we have a neutron abundance and though small it allows ( n , p ) or @xmath81 reactions to populate the next lowest isobar .",
    "the ( p,@xmath7 ) flow is governed by the separation energies .    the end result for this trajectory is the production of the light @xmath0-process nuclei from kr to pd . the ( n , p ) reactions can continue to carry the flow even at low temperatures because such reactions on targets a few neutrons to the proton side of stability typically have positive q - values ( i.e. no thresholds ) .",
    "the flow to heavier nuclei eventually stops when the charged particle reactions freeze out ( t@xmath142 ) and at late times ( once the waiting points are passed ) when ( n , p ) and ( n,@xmath7 ) reactions or weak decay direct the flows toward stability .",
    "an interesting although unfortunate occurrence is the low ( relative to ru and pd ) production of the most abundant @xmath0-nucleus in nature , @xmath18mo . as the proton capture flow moves up the n=46 isotones ( see figure [ j570_s1_psp_zn2sn ] ) it is stopped in part because @xmath72rh has a small proton separation energy .",
    "this prevents efficient population of @xmath143 ( z = n=46 ) and so breaks the pattern of synthesizing the even - even n = z nuclei . as a consequence the flow detours towards stability until reaching n=47 and n=48 .",
    "the result is that the radioactive progenitor for @xmath18mo is now the odd - odd nucleus @xmath18rh .",
    "the flow moves very quickly through this nucleus ( as well as through @xmath18ru ) , and little is left for decay at the end of this trajectory .",
    "it is notable that the heavier @xmath0-nuclei , @xmath2ru and @xmath8pd , are co - produced in amounts that might explain their solar abundances .",
    "their radioactive progenitors are associated with nuclei in the two nearby closed shells .",
    "heavier @xmath144 nuclei ( @xmath8cd etc . ) are not made here because the flow failed to populate isotopes in the z=50 proton shell .",
    "@xmath18mo is the only one of these intermediate @xmath0-nuclei that ( for now ) appears to have an odd - z progenitor .",
    "we note however that the flow goes through regions where the possible error on @xmath141 is potentially large ( indicated by the t , meaning the value of @xmath141 was from an extrapolation from measured values ) .",
    "more accurate measurements here would be most welcome , and would have significant impact on our understanding of @xmath0-process nuclei and their solar abundances since this material is ejected ( unlike the case in x - ray bursts ) . as an example , the uncertainty in the proton separation energy of @xmath145 is about 600 kev . a plausible 1 mev increase in this separation energy results in a 50@xmath57 increase in the yield of @xmath18mo in trajectory 6 .",
    "figure [ j570_s2_tc2xe ] shows nucleosynthesis in a trajectory characterized by the production of many free neutrons per heavy nucleus .",
    "this trajectory has an initial electron fraction @xmath59 and entropy @xmath146 .",
    "it was constructed by doubling the entropy in the 2-d simulation of trajectory 6 ( table [ 5512570_final ] ) . for this modified outflow @xmath147 .",
    "when material in this modified trajectory reaches a temperature of about t@xmath148 , ( p,@xmath7 ) reactions on @xmath149sn ( with @xmath150 mev ) pierce the z=50 closed proton shell . at the time",
    "shown in figure [ j570_s2_tc2xe ] ( 2.21 sec , t@xmath151 ) , the charged particle reactions have frozen out , but the flow has entered an area where weak decay has yet to dominate . instead , ( n , p ) and ( n,@xmath7 ) reactions carry the flow rapidly toward stability .",
    "the @xmath0-nuclei of ru , pd , and cd are all made as radioactive progenitors in the closed neutron ( ru ) and proton ( pd & cd ) shells .",
    "we are in a very novel regime , where one can synthesize @xmath0-nuclei ( like @xmath152sn and @xmath9te ) via neutron capture reactions .",
    "current supernova simulations , without modification , provide the necessary conditions required to explain the origin of a number of @xmath0-process isotopes between a = 92 and 126 whose origin in nature has always been unclear .",
    "the site is the proton - rich bubble that powers the explosion and the early neutrino - powered wind that develops right behind it .",
    "the synthesis is primary , so a neutron star derived from a metal poor progenitor star would produce the same yields ( so long as the neutron star itself had the same properties ) .",
    "very metal deficient stars formed from these ejecta would be characterized by a excess of both @xmath0-process nuclei and @xmath10-process nuclei compared to the @xmath11-process , but since there is no element that is dominantly @xmath0-process , observational diagnostics may be difficult .    in particular , large quantities of @xmath62 and @xmath153pd",
    "are produced in our calculations ( fig .",
    "[ allfig ] ) .",
    "synthesis of @xmath0-process isotopes as heavy as @xmath154 can also be achieved by only factor - of - two modifications to the entropy of the baseline simulation .",
    "it is interesting in this regard to note that an even larger increase in entropy is needed later in the _",
    "neutron_-rich wind for the efficient synthesis of the @xmath10-process isotopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is quite possibly informing us of some additional heating mechanism that operates in the mass outflow during the first few seconds of a neutron star s life .",
    "possible mechanisms are magnetic field entrainment of the outflowing matter @xcite , magnetic energy dissipation @xcite , acoustic energy input @xcite , or alfvn wave dampening @xcite",
    ". none of these were included in the present supernova model , but we varied the entropy to determine qualitatively their effect .    in the more extreme , but still physically reasonable case",
    "that the entropy is multiplied by three , the synthesis extends all the way to @xmath155yb , with the accompanying production of many isotopes normally attributed to the @xmath11-process and even the @xmath10-process .",
    "somewhat disappointingly , none of our calculations produce a large overabundance of @xmath18mo compared to surrounding isotopes ( though some do make 10% of the necessary value ) .",
    "this may reflect either the fact that @xmath18mo has another origin , e.g. , the same neutrino - powered wind a few seconds later when @xmath25 = 0.485 , or uncertainties in the nuclear physics . in the current study , the @xmath18mo that is made",
    "is produced as the odd - odd progenitor @xmath18rh .",
    "this does not take advantage of the extra stability that would be afforded by an even - even nucleus like @xmath18pd , let alone the magic neutron shell of @xmath18mo itself .",
    "indeed the binding energies and lifetimes of nuclei in the vicinity of @xmath18pd are quite uncertain .",
    "an important aspect of the synthesis calculated here is that none of the @xmath0-nuclei are made as themselves ; all have proton - rich progenitors .",
    "many of these progenitors are so unstable that even their masses and lifetimes are not measured , let alone their cross sections for interacting with neutrons and protons .",
    "a similar situation is encountered in the @xmath6-process in type i x - ray bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a critical difference being that the isotopes made here are actually ejected and contribute to the solar inventory of heavy elements .",
    "the study of these is a major goal for nuclear astrophysics experiments of the future , like the rare isotope accelerator ( http://www.anl.gov/ria/index.html ) . for",
    "now , we can only note that these nuclear uncertainties are almost certainly responsible for a large fraction of the spread in production factors in , e.g. figs .",
    "[ allfig ] and [ 2sfig ] .",
    "this study has explored only a relatively limited set of outflow parameter space based upon simple modifications to trajectories found in one particular simulation .",
    "further studies will surely be carried out by us and others , but we have identified a key physical parameter , @xmath78 ( eq .",
    "2 ) , which characterizes the solution for various combinations of time scale , @xmath25 , and entropy .",
    "@xmath78 is essentially a dimensionless measure of the number of neutrons produced by neutrino capture on protons compared to the number of heavy seed nuclei .",
