    "in addition to its use as a laboratory for studying general relativity and plasma physics , the double pulsar system j07373039 @xcite provides new insights into the evolution of massive binary systems . in the standard model for binary pulsar formation ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ? * ) , double neutron star systems are formed from massive binary systems where the initially more massive ( primary ) star evolves off the main sequence and undergoes a supernova explosion to form a neutron star . during the evolution of the initially less massive ( secondary ) star , the first - born neutron star accretes matter and gains angular momentum spinning it up to short periods and ( through poorly understood processes ;",
    "* ) reducing its magnetic field .",
    "if the secondary is sufficiently massive to explode as a supernova , and the binary system survives this explosion , the resulting system is a pair of neutron stars : a short - period recycled pulsar from the primary and a young `` normal '' pulsar from the secondary .",
    "the double pulsar system j07373039 where a recycled 22.7-ms pulsar ( hereafter a ) is observed in a 2.4-hr orbit around a 2.77-s pulsar ( hereafter b ) presents a new opportunity to study this model .",
    "we use the current spin parameters of the two pulsars , together with models for their spin - down evolution , to place constraints on the age of the system .",
    "the motivation for this work is twofold .",
    "firstly , a better constraint on the system age would reduce the uncertainties in empirical studies of the rate of binary neutron star inspirals  one of the key sources for gravitational wave observatories ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . secondly , because the age can be used to directly compute the post - supernova orbital parameters , we may be able to better constrain b s progenitor mass and in turn improve our understanding of the formation of this unique binary system @xcite .",
    "a preliminary version of these results was presented @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider models which account for the modification of b s spin by a s relativistic wind . following a brief review of the properties of j07373039 in section [ sec:0737 ]",
    ", we derive age constraints based on various spin - down models for both pulsars in section [ sec : spindown ] and discuss their implications in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    ".[tab : models ] summary of the model assumptions used in this paper . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "applying the binary recycling scenario to the double pulsar system , we identify a as the first - born neutron star which was spun up ( recycled ) by the mass accretion process .",
    "b is then the neutron star formed during the supernova explosion of the secondary . using the observed spin parameters of both pulsars to estimate their surface magnetic fields @xmath1 , we find @xmath2 g and @xmath3 g. that a s field is some three orders of magnitude lower than that of b is in accord with the recycling hypothesis  i.e.  the weaker field of a is a consequence of the recycling process .",
    "we note however , that due to the interaction of a s wind which penetrates deep into b s magnetosphere ( lyne et al .",
    "2004 ) , some care should be taken when interpreting the exact value of b s magnetic field .",
    "@xcite have proposed a model in which a s wind exerts a propellor torque on b which dominates its spin - down . in this case , the implied magnetic field strength of b is a factor of three lower than the above dipole estimate .    after the accretion phase , it is assumed that both neutron stars have been spinning down due to a steady braking torque ; as such they represent independent clocks measuring the time since accretion ceased .",
    "a straightforward test of the prediction is to use the characteristic ages of a and b : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "lyne et al .  ( 2004 ) find @xmath6 yr and @xmath7 yr .",
    "possible explanations for this discrepancy are : ( i ) the standard evolutionary scenario does not apply ; ( ii ) as observed in other pulsars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) characteristic ages are not reliable due to their simplifying assumptions ; ( iii ) both the model and the characteristic ages are wrong .    given the circumstantial evidence in favour of the recycling hypothesis , and the absence of viable alternative models , the simplest resolution is option ( ii ) . in the rest of this paper , we investigate the consequences of this case and show that , when the simplifying assumptions of the characteristic ages are taken into account , the apparent age differences of the two pulsars can be reconciled .",
    "our goal is to use the observed parameters and models for the spin - down of the two neutron stars in j07373039 to place constraints on the system age and pulsar birth parameters . before describing specifics",
    ", we first outline our general approach . for each pulsar",
    ", we consider a generic spin - down model of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the spin period , @xmath10 is the braking index ( for spin - down due to magnetic dipole radiation , @xmath11 ) and the factor @xmath12 depends on the neutron star moment of inertia , braking torque applied to the star and , for some models of b s spin evolution , the effect of a s relativistic wind . to distinguish between each pulsar ,",
    "we add a and b subscripts where appropriate .",
    "our basic approach is to apply and solve the equation under certain model constraints to find the ` spin - down ' age of each pulsar , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "table [ tab : models ] summarizes the different models we investigated .",
    "a key assertion we then make is that the spin - down age for a , @xmath15 , refers to the time since spin - up ceased , and is essentially the same epoch as b began life as a pulsar .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath16 since this condition is only met for certain sets of birth parameters , we can use it to find the most probable age of the system assuming a given set of model assumptions .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions ] and discussed in detail in the following subsections .",
    "in the simplest case , where @xmath12 and @xmath10 are independent of time , equation ( [ equ : generic ] ) can be integrated directly to find @xmath17 .",
    "for the case @xmath18 , we find @xmath19 while , for all other values of @xmath10 , the solution is @xmath20.\\ ] ] here , @xmath21 is the initial spin period and the characteristic age @xmath22 . since the current period and period derivative are readily observable through timing observations , the unknown parameters are @xmath10 and @xmath21 for each pulsar .",
    "we explore the parameter space using a monte carlo simulation to compute the spin - down age for b assuming an initial spin period and braking index .",
    "then , assuming a braking index for a , we compute the required initial spin period of a and the age of the system by asserting equation ( [ equ : assume ] ) . as a starting point , hereafter known as model 1 , we adopt a braking index for b based on observations of other normal pulsars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) which are consistent with a flat distribution in the range @xmath23 .",
    "given the completely unknown braking indices for recycled pulsars in general , for a we took a more conservative approach and assumed a flat distribution in the range @xmath24 .",
    "to show the effect of b s unknown initial spin period on the results , we performed all simulations using a flat distribution in the range @xmath25 ( dotted lines ) and for @xmath26  ms ( solid lines ) .",
    "the upper bound in the latter case is taken from the range of initial spin periods inferred from pulsars with multiple age constraints ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the resulting initial spin period distribution for a peaks just below 20 ms and the age distribution peaks at @xmath0 myr ( i.e.  b s characteristic age ) .",
    "model 1 assumes no decay of the braking torque .",
    "an alternative solution to equation ( [ equ : generic ] ) can be found for the case where the braking torque @xmath12 decays with time .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , an exponential decay of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a constant and @xmath29 is the @xmath30 decay time , equation ( [ equ : generic ] ) integrates to yield the so - called `` reduced age '' , i.e. : @xmath31 here , @xmath17 is described by either equation ( [ equ : sd1 ] ) or ( [ equ : sd2 ] ) depending on the assumed value of @xmath10 .",
    "the cause and even existence of torque decay in isolated non - recycled neutron stars is uncertain and controversial ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in young neutron stars ,",
    "it is thought to be due to either the decay of the magnetic field and/or the alignment of the spin and magnetic axes with time ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since torque decay is not thought to be significant for recycled pulsars after the accretion phase ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider only the case in which the torque on b decays . in models 2 and 3 the simulated distributions shown in fig .",
    "1 result from the equality @xmath32 assuming pure magnetic dipole braking ( @xmath33 ) and a torque decay on b with a timescale of 10 myr in model 2 and 100 myr in model 3 . in both cases ,",
    "the time since spin - up ceased is smaller than for model 1 , with the age distribution peaking at 2030 myr .",
    "so far we have assumed the spin - down of both pulsars to be independent . in reality , as noted by @xcite , a s rate of loss of spin - down energy is 3000 times that of b ; this , together with the close proximity of the two pulsars in their orbit , means that b s spin - down is significantly affected by a s relativistic wind .",
    "direct observational evidence for such an interaction was presented by @xcite .    to model these effects ,",
    "we follow the results of @xcite and consider two cases . in the first , hereafter model 4 , it is assumed that all the poynting flux from b is dissipated when it reaches the interface between a s wind and b s truncated magnetosphere . using equation ( 9 ) from @xcite for this case",
    ", we find that @xmath34 where @xmath35 depends on b s radius and intrinsic magnetic field , @xmath36 is the spin - down energy loss rate of a and @xmath37 is the separation of the two pulsars .",
    "the basic spin evolution of b in this model implies a braking index @xmath38 which is modified by a s spin - down energy loss .",
    "such a dependence can also be found from the model of @xcite .    in the second case put forward by @xcite ,",
    "hereafter model 5 , the interface is partially resistive and large surface currents produced combine with a poloidal magnetic field of b to produce a spin - down torque .",
    "this process results in a relationship of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 also depends on b s radius and magnetic field strength . in this case , the spin evolution of b is independent of its own period ( corresponding to a braking index @xmath41 ) and is completely dominated by a s spin - down energy loss .    to derive age constraints for models 4 and 5 , we adopt a slightly different approach since equations [ equ : interact1 ] and [ equ : interact2 ] can not be integrated analytically . instead , we solve for the spin period evolution of b numerically assuming the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath40 to be constant .",
    "starting with the currently observed spin parameters , we step back in time and calculate the variation of @xmath42 using equation ( 1 ) to compute @xmath43 and @xmath44 at each epoch .",
    "we assume the canonical neutron star moment of inertia @xmath45  kg  m@xmath46 .",
    "simultaneously , we evaluate @xmath37 using the results of @xcite and @xcite . during the calculation , we also keep track of whether a s wind continues to penetrate b s magnetosphere using equations ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) from @xcite in the numerator of equation ( 10 ) of @xcite to calculate the magnetic field strength of b. ] . at the point",
    "when this condition is no longer met , we follow b s spin evolution using the standard spin - down formula given in equation ( [ equ : generic ] ) .",
    "example evolution curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tinteract ] for the case of underlying dipolar spin - down ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the results of our monte carlo simulations for models 4 and 5 are shown alongside the other models in fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions ] . unlike the other models , the system age constraints depend strongly on b s unknown birth spin period .",
    "assuming b s period was @xmath48  ms at birth , the age distributions peak sharply at 180 and 80 myr respectively for models 4 and 5 .",
    "for a broader range of initial spin periods , the system age becomes less well constrained .",
    "the reason for this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tinteract ] which shows the large range of system ages possible for a given @xmath49 .",
    "we have considered a range of spin down models to place age constraints in the double pulsar system . a striking result of this study is the variety of possible system ages .",
    "these range from @xmath50  myr ( model 2 ) to almost 200  myr ( model 4 ) .",
    "models 13 , which do not account for the effect of a s wind on b , favour significantly smaller ages than models 4 and 5 which do account for the interaction .",
    "all models we considered favoured an initial spin period for a that is close to its currently observed value , with the peak of the distribution in the range 1520 ms .",
    "this range is consistent with a s initial spin period predicted by accretion spin - up models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the current evidence in favour of initial spin periods for normal pulsars to be @xmath48  ms ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for interaction between a and b @xcite , we prefer the constraints provided by the solid lines for models 4 and 5 shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : distributions ] .",
    "since the age of j07373039 determines its contribution to the coalescence rate of neutron star binaries , we briefly revisit the results of the calculations most recently carried out by @xcite where an age of 230  myr was assumed .",
    "taking into account the additional time to coalescence of 85  myr , estimates of the total lifetime of j07373039 in this paper range between 105  myr and 265  myr . from table  1 of @xcite , we find that the contribution to the global merger rate made by j07373039 would therefore either increase by 100% in the youngest case , or drop by 10% in the oldest case . in our opinion ,",
    "the most realistic spin - down models we have considered are those which take into account the interaction , and assume that b s initial spin period was negligible compared to its current value . for model 4 ,",
    "the estimated lifetime would be @xmath51  myr , i.e.  the merger rate contribution would increase by 40% over the value found by kim et al .",
    ", whereas for model 5 , the contribution does not change significantly",
    ". given the uncertainties in merger rate estimates , our results do not change the conclusions that binary neutron star inspirals are unlikely to be detectable by the current gravitational wave detectors .",
    "however , the prospects for detection by future instruments such as advanced ligo are excellent .",
    "our results can be used to constrain the post - supernova orbital parameters in the double pulsar system . using the formulae given by @xcite and @xcite we find the mean orbital separation and eccentricity after the formation of b to be respectively @xmath52  m and 0.14 for an age of 180  myr favoured by model 4 .",
    "for the 80  myr solution from model 5 , the corresponding numbers are @xmath53  m and 0.11 .",
    "these constraints in turn restrict the allowed ranges of system parameters at the time of the second supernova @xcite .",
    "we have repeated the analysis of @xcite who constrain the likely kick velocity at the time of the second supernova , @xmath54 , the tilt angle betweem the pre and post - supernova orbital planes , @xmath55 , and the pre - supernova mass of b s progenitor star , @xmath56 .",
    "these simulations were carried out assuming the two different prior distributions of the current ( unknown ) radial velocity of psr  j0737@xmath573039 , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we have imposed our two possible age solutions to the simulations described by @xcite by restricting the age ranges considered to be either 7090  myr , or 170190  myr as opposed to the range of up to 100  myr originally considered by @xcite . in general ,",
    "we obtain consistent results to @xcite which indicates that their work does not critically depend on the system age .",
    "the only exception is the 7090  myr simulation assuming the gaussian radial velocity distribution , for which the age constraints favour slightly lower @xmath58 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 values than the unconstrained case .",
    "the new age constraints derived here are fully consistent with the idea that b s progenitor was a low - mass star , and that the system received a relatively small impulsive kick at the time of the second supernova @xcite .",
