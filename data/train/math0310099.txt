    "the study of the topology of lagrangian submanifolds took off starting in the mid 1980 s .",
    "this early work is surveyed in an influential paper of eliashberg and polterovich @xcite .",
    "the existence of smoothly knotted lagrangian tori in some simply connected four dimensional symplectic manifolds was recently demonstrated by s. vidussi , @xcite .",
    "the paper of vidussi contains more history and background of the problem . shortly thereafter ,",
    "r. fintushel and r. stern introduced a second invariant that could distinguish smoothly knotted lagrangian tori and applied their invariant to variations of vidussi s construction @xcite . in this paper",
    "we note that the fundamental group of the complement of a lagrangian torus may also be used to show that it is knotted .",
    "i would like to thank stefano vidussi for asking the question that led to this paper , and for several discussions about this material .",
    "i would also like to thank ron fintushel for his comments on a preliminary version of the paper .",
    "the essence of the construction of knotted lagrangians that was devloped by vidussi in @xcite may be summarized as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-manifold that fibers over @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3-manifold @xmath4 inherits a symplectic form expressible as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the standard @xmath7-form on @xmath2 , @xmath8 is the natural projection @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the composition of the projection onto the second factor followed by the projection of @xmath0 onto @xmath2 , and @xmath11 is an area form on the fibers of @xmath0 . in this manifold ,",
    "any torus of the form , @xmath12 is symplectic i.e. @xmath13 restricts to a symplectic form whenever @xmath14 is an embedded circle transverse to all of the fibers of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , any torus of the form , @xmath15 is lagrangian i.e. @xmath13 restricts to zero whenever @xmath16 is an embedded circle in one of the fibers of @xmath0 .",
    "more complicated examples may be constructed by taking symplectic fiber sums with other symplectic manifolds .    in @xcite stefano vidussi",
    "used the seiberg - witten invariants of the symplectic sum of an @xmath17 with those examples summed with non - rational elliptic surfaces along the lagrangian torus to prove that the various lagrangian tori were not smoothly isotopic .",
    "ron fintushel and ron stern later used relative seiberg witten invariants of the complement of the lagrangian tori to prove that they are not smoothly isotopic @xcite .",
    "fintushel and stern described a particularly simple special case of their invariant as a lagrangian framing defect .",
    "the fundamental group of the complement of the torus is a natural invariant that could in principal detect ( even topologically ) non - isotopic tori . for many examples the fundamental group of the complement will not detect anything .",
    "however there are homotopic lagrangian tori having complements with non isomorphic fundamental groups .",
    "these examples may be chosen to be null - homologous with zero lagrangian framing defect .",
    "the first specific example considered in @xcite took the following form .",
    "let @xmath18 represent the @xmath19 torus knot , and @xmath20 be the result of @xmath21-surgery on @xmath22 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath20 fibers over @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be the rational elliptic surface @xcite , and set @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a meridian to @xmath25 .",
    "figure 1 below shows , among other things , a knot @xmath26 on a fiber in the exterior of the knot @xmath25 .",
    "for the first example , we will ensure that @xmath26 does not link @xmath24 . by inspection , @xmath27 as a knot in @xmath28 . as we will see the fundamental group of the complement of @xmath29 in @xmath30 is isomorphic to @xmath31 .",
    "however doubling this construction in an appropriate sense will result in a fundamental group that surjects onto the fundamental group of the complement of the @xmath32 torus knot .",
    "our doubled construction begins with the knot , @xmath33 . here",
    "the overline refers to taking the reflection of the knot , and the minus sign refers to switching the orientation of the knot .",
    "our symplectic manifold is defined by , @xmath34 , where @xmath24 is a meridian to @xmath33 .",
    "we will consider the lagrangian tori , @xmath35 in @xmath36 .",
    "we will use the following alternate description of @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the exterior of @xmath33 .",
    "we then have @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the fiber in @xmath17 .",
    "this allows us to apply the seifert - van kampen theorem to compute @xmath42 as follows .",
    "@xmath43 the third line of the above computation follows because @xmath44 .",
    "the fourth line follows because glueing anything that kills the fundamental group of the boundary will have the same effect .",
    "the @xmath45 that we glue in replaces @xmath46 , kills the generator of the @xmath2 factor , and adds one more relation . to complete the proof we need to compute @xmath33 in @xmath47 .",
    "we begin by computing the element of @xmath48 represented by @xmath25 .",
    "we will use the wirtinger generators depicted in figure 1 . recall that a wirtinger generator is a loop that starts at the base point , goes over the knot , under in the direction of the arrow and then back over the knot to the base point , @xcite . using the wirtinger relation",
    "we see that the generators on the bottom of a @xmath49 twist will be @xmath50 , @xmath51 , ",
    "@xmath52 , when the generators at the top of the twist are @xmath53 ,  @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath55 is just a stack of @xmath56 @xmath49-twists , this allows us to obtain the presentation , @xmath57 , and label every strand in the diagram for @xmath55 .",
    "the element of @xmath8 represented by @xmath25 may now be read off of the diagram .",
    "we obtain , @xmath58 $ ] where @xmath59 . in computing",
    "this expression , we reversed the obvious reidemeister i move on the right side of figure 1 , and grouped terms after each group of undercrossings . since @xmath26 lies on a seifert surface for @xmath25 , we know that the linking number of @xmath26 and @xmath25 is zero , so @xmath25 must be ( as we found it ) in the commutator subgroup of the knot group of @xmath26 . in this case",
    "@xmath25 normally generates the commutator subgroup , so the knot group of @xmath26 mod @xmath25 is isomorphic to the infinite cyclic group .",
    "the standard generators of the knot group of @xmath60 are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we will apply the seifert vankampen theorem to compute the knot group of @xmath63 , and the element @xmath33 in that group .",
    "the twice punctured plane of symmetry in the complement of @xmath63 in figure 2 becomes a twice punctured @xmath64 when we add the point at infinity .",
    "two copies of the complement of @xmath26 are glued together along this punctured sphere .",
    "the resulting presentation of the fundamental group is @xmath65 and @xmath66 represents @xmath67[b_1,v]^{-1}$ ] where @xmath68 . setting @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and rewriting the presentation of the knot group of @xmath63 in terms of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath62 results in the stated presentation of the complement of @xmath74 .",
    "the computation at the beginning of the previous lemma shows that the fundamental group of the complement of a lagrangian torus of the form @xmath75 in @xmath76 always takes the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 $ ] is the class of @xmath79 and @xmath16 is a knot in a fiber of the fibered knot , @xmath79 .",
    "the fundamental group of the complement of @xmath80 in @xmath30 is always @xmath31 .",
    "however the fintushel - stern lagrangian framing defect is given by @xmath81 , so the tori @xmath80 represent distinct isotopy classes .    for any knot of the form , @xmath82 in a fiber of a knot of the form @xmath83 , the fundamental group of the complement of @xmath84 in @xmath85 will surject onto the knot group of @xmath16 .",
    "thus such lagrangian tori are not isotopic to the standard nullhomologous lagrangian tori . by symmetry",
    "the lagrangian framing defect of fintushel and stern will vanish on the tori @xmath84 .",
    "vidussi s technique of summing with an @xmath17 is an appropriate way or fintushel and stern s main invariant @xmath86 may still in principal detect this .",
    "the next proposition will establish that all of the groups in the previous proposition are distinct .",
    "thus the tori @xmath74 form an infinite family of nonisotopic lagrangian tori that are all homotopic .",
    "we will use the order ideal of the alexander module to distinguish these groups @xcite . introducing new variables , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90",
    "will allow the presentation to be written in the form : @xmath91 from this presentation it is clear that the abelianization of @xmath92 is infinite cyclic .",
    "furthermore from the same presentation one can see that the commutator subgroup , @xmath93 $ ] is generated by the elements , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .",
    "the abelianization of the commutator subgroup , @xmath97 inherits the structure of a @xmath98$]-module with @xmath99 acting by conjugation . as a @xmath98$]-module it has a presentation , @xmath100 here @xmath101 we are making the obvious abuses of notation with @xmath99 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103",
    "this module is called the alexander module .",
    "the order ideal of this module is the ideal of @xmath98 $ ] generated by @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the number @xmath106 is a zero of every polynomial in the order ideal , and the numbers @xmath107 are not zeros of @xmath104 for any @xmath108 .",
