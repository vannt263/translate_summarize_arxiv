    "discrete scale invariance ( dsi ) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in human made fractals and also in the fractals of nature .",
    "the list of applications of discrete scale invariance covers phenomena in a wide range of topics such as diffusion in anisotropic quenched random lattices @xcite , growth processes and rupture @xcite , non - extensive statistical physics @xcite , econophysics @xcite , sociophysics @xcite , as well as quenched disordered systems @xcite and cosmic lacunarity @xcite , for review of the concept and other applications see @xcite .",
    "the signature of the presence of dsi is complex exponent which manifest itself in log - periodic corrections to scaling . in some cases the log - periodic oscillations appear in the time dependence of some physical quantities such as the energy release on the approach of impending rupture @xcite and earthquakes @xcite and in some other cases the dsi appears in the geometry of the system , the most famous cases being animals @xcite , diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) @xcite and sandpile model on sierpinski gasket @xcite .",
    "recently we found an other example in surface science , some of the rough surfaces as well as their contour lines show clear dsi in their geometry @xcite . the rough surfaces have been the subject of intense studies for many years @xcite .",
    "the first predictions of the scaling exponents of the contour lines of the scale invariant rough surfaces appeared in @xcite .",
    "the scaling exponents predicted in @xcite were confirmed numerically in @xcite and the different applications of the findings in glassy interfaces and turbulence were discussed in @xcite .",
    "after the invention of the stochastic schramm - loewner evolution @xcite which describes scale invariant curves in two dimensions a revival appeared in the field and many new properties of the contour lines were investigated , for example see @xcite",
    ". one of the most important findings of the paper @xcite is the dependence of the different exponents of the contour lines to the only universal parameter in the system , i.e. roughness ( _ hurst _ ) exponent .",
    "they showed that for the full scale invariant rough surfaces the fractal dimension of all of the contours @xmath1 , the fractal dimension of one contour @xmath2 and the length distribution exponent @xmath3 of the contour lines are just simple functions of the roughness exponent .",
    "altough there is no theoretical proof for the scaling relations found in @xcite they were confirmed in many different numerical studies @xcite .",
    "+ the building block of the functions with dsi is weierstrass - mandelbrot ( wm ) function which was studied by berry and lewis in @xcite . it is a random continuous non differentiable mono fractal function that one can see it in a wide range of physical phenomena such as sediment , turbulence @xcite and propagation and localization of waves in fractal media @xcite .",
    "the function is scale invariant just for particular value of the scale parameter @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the @xmath5 limit the wm function converges to the brownian motion . in the other words one can think about wm function as the perturbed brownian motion which the perturbing parameter is the @xmath4 .",
    "the same argument is also true for the 2d wm function @xcite and one can think about the 2d wm function as the mono fractal rough surface with the dsi property for the specific value of @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that up to the fractal dimension calculations many properties of the wm function is the same as the brownian motion counterpart .",
    "what we are going to do in this paper is confirming this idea for the contour lines of the 2d wm function .",
    "we will show numerically that many exponents of the contour lines of the 2d wm function are the same as the exponents of the contour lines of the corresponding 2d brownian sheet .",
    "in other words we confirm the same scaling relations as the paper @xcite for our discrete mono scale invariant contour lines .",
    "+ the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we will introduce 1d and 2d weierstrass - mandelbrot function and we will discuss the dsi property of the surfaces .",
    "the third section is basically for fixing the notation and introducing different exponents , most of the materials of this section were already discussed in @xcite . in the forth section",
    "we will numerically confirm all the proposed scaling exponents and relations of the third section and we will show the universality of those relations . in the last section we will summarize our findings and we will give some comments about the possible future directions .",
