    "since a decade ago , there have been a lot of activities on bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of atoms with spin degree of freedom  @xcite , for example , in spin-1  @xcite and pseudospin-@xmath0 gases  @xcite , as well as bec of a mixture of two kinds of spinless atoms  @xcite . as a step beyond these research lines , a novel class of bec , the so - called entangled bec ( ebec ) , was proposed as the ground state of a mixture of two distinct species of pseudospin-@xmath0 atoms with interspecies spin exchange in some parameter regime  @xcite .",
    "spin - exchange scattering between atoms of different species entangles these two species , and ebec may lead to a novel kind of superfluidity  @xcite .",
    "more recently , ebec has also been found in a mixture of spin-@xmath1 atoms  @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that ebec may be experimentally realized using two different species of alkali atoms . in some aspects",
    ", ebec bears some analogies with a single species of pseudospin-@xmath0 atoms in a double well  @xcite or occupying two orbital modes  @xcite , but there are also important differences due to the fact that two atoms of distinct species are distinguishable . in general , there are four orbital wave functions into which the atoms of the two species and two pseudospin states condense into , respectively .    under single - mode approximation for orbital degree of freedom , the many - body hamiltonian can be written as  @xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) is the annihilation operator of the species @xmath6 , @xmath7 is related to the scattering lengths as the following .",
    "in general , @xmath8 is the scattering length for the scattering in which an @xmath6-atom flips from @xmath9 to @xmath10 while a @xmath11-atom flips from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the reduced mass .",

    "the total spin operator of species @xmath6 ( @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the single spin operator .",
    "hence the hamiltonian can be transformed into that of two coupled giant spins ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 does not depend on spins .",

    "this ground state leads to interesting physical consequences .",

    ", we extend the consideration of this model to a more general case of the parameters , namely , @xmath42 , denoted as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , denoted as @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , and thus the hamiltonian becomes @xmath47 which reduces to the isotropic antiferromagnetic coupling when @xmath48 while @xmath49 .",
    "in other words , we assume that there is such a rotational symmetry that the hamiltonian only depends on the total @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which are thus good quantum numbers .",
    "we believe that under a perturbation due to deviation of the parameters from this condition , the ground state is still close to the present one in each parameter regime discussed below , based on an extension of the previous analysis for the isotropic parameter point  @xcite , the details of which will be reported elsewhere .    in sec .",
