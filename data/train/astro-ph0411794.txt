    "the formation of topological defects during symmetry - breaking phase transitions in the early universe  @xcite is a generic prediction of grand unified theories .",

    "if in a second phase transition the @xmath5 is broken down to @xmath6 , @xmath7 each monopole gets attached to @xmath8 strings . for @xmath9 , a long - lived monopole - string network ( `` necklaces '' ) forms which may evolve towards the scaling regime with several long ( infinite ) strings and many closed string loops inside the hubble horizon .",
    "the case @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 is rather different : the second phase transition results in single monopole - antimonopole pairs connected by one string . typically , the life - time of this system is much shorter than the hubble time and it does not survive until present .",
    "an important signature of both systems is the emitted gravitational radiation .",

    "@xcite  detectable for advanced gravitational wave detectors like ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite and lisa  @xcite . for the case of string networks that survive until present , damour and vilenkin  @xcite considered the gravitational radiation from cusps of a string network .",
    "they argued that the resulting gravitational wave bursts ( gwbs ) may be detectable for string tensions as small as @xmath3 .",
    "in this work , we investigate the gravitational radiation from a simple rotating system consisting of a straight string and two monopoles attached to its ends .",
    "we assume that the ( anti- ) monopole charges are confined inside the string and thus the main energy losses of the topological defects is the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "the solution to the equation of motion for such a system , dubbed  rotating rod  , was found in ref .",
    "we derive the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted and simple asymptotic formulas for different frequency ranges .",
    "we find that the dimensionless parameter @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the string tension , @xmath14 the distance between monopoles and @xmath15 the monopole mass , determines the main features of the emitted spectrum : for not too high mode numbers , @xmath16 , the gravitational wave spectrum can be approximated by @xmath17 . in the high - frequency limit , @xmath18 , the gravitational radiation is exponentially suppressed . for moderate mode numbers , @xmath19 , in which most energy is radiated , the spectrum obtained is very similar to the one of an oscillating monopole - antimonopole pair connected by a string .",
    "we conclude therefore that the spectrum found applies also to the generic case of a superposition of a rotational and oscillatory motion of the monopole - string system .    using the obtained gravitational radiation spectrum of the rotating rod solution we study how the presence of monopoles and antimonopoles in a string network influences the possibility to observe gwbs .",

    "in this section we study the possibility to detect the gravitational radiation from oscillating and rotating monopole - string systems . in the first part , we consider the gravitational radiation from a network of monopoles and antimonopoles connected by @xmath8 strings .",
    "the evolution of such a network can be analyzed in two limiting cases .",
    "if monopoles are light enough , then the cosmic string network does not feel the presence of monopoles .",
    "thus we obtain the `` normal '' scaling solution for the network evolution where the typical length @xmath112 of closed strings is @xmath113 here , @xmath24 is the cosmological time and the dimensionless coefficient @xmath114 determines the gravitational radiation from strings . in the opposite limit , we may assume that the gravitational radiation from monopoles is the dominant energy loss mechanism .",
    "then we find , following ref .",
    "@xcite , another scaling solution for the typical distance @xmath115 between monopoles with @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the typical lorentz - factor of the monopoles and @xmath118 .",
    "apart from an numerically not too important factor @xmath119 , the two limits give the same characteristic length @xmath112 for the network .",
    "should be imposed because for very high lorentz - factors @xmath117 the monopoles lose their energy to the gravitational radiation less efficiently than given by ( [ ptotest ] ) .",
    "this is because for very high @xmath117 the monopoles does not accelerated linearly like @xmath120 but are involved in the general string motion .",
    "therefore we can estimate the typical scale @xmath112 of the necklace network by the `` usual '' formula ( [ length ] ) , where @xmath112 is the closed loop length or the distance between the monopoles . ]",
    "the presence of monopoles ( and antimonopoles ) on the strings changes the gwbs from cusps of cosmic strings .",
    "massive particles living on the string affect the cusp formation which happens only in the case of `` ordinary '' nambu - goto strings . adding monopoles makes strings heavier and smoothes - out cusps , similar to the presence of superconducting currents on the string .",
    "the consequence of smoothed cusps is a cut - off in the emitted gravitational radiation  @xcite .",
    "therefore we assume that the presence of monopoles on the strings leads to a cut - off given by eq .",
    "( [ cut - off ] ) , @xmath121    in ref .",
    "@xcite , damour and vilenkin argued that the gravitational bursts from ordinary string cusps can be detected by the gravitational wave detectors like ligo , virgo and especially lisa .",
    "how is this analysis changed by the presence of monopoles on the strings ?",
    "the main difference of the radiation of a string - monopole network from the radiation of an ordinary string network is the existence of a cut - off frequency , such that the signal from cusps with frequencies @xmath122 is highly suppressed .",
    "the cut - off frequency of the arriving signal is @xmath123 where at redshift @xmath124 matter and radiation densities are equal .",
    "the typical length of loops decreases with @xmath125 and consequently the cut - off frequency increases with red - shift . using eq .",
    "( [ length ] ) and @xmath126 , the behavior of the lorentz - factor as function of the redshift follows as @xmath127 hence , the cut - off frequency is given by @xmath128 the analysis given by damour and vilenkin @xcite leads to the following result : for a given frequency @xmath129 and for a given string parameter @xmath13 ( or , strictly speaking , for a given parameter @xmath130 ) the amplitude of incoming signals @xmath131 from cusps in the universe decrease with @xmath125 , but the number of such signals per unit time @xmath132 increases with @xmath125 .",
    "thus , we should find the compromise between the rate of signals and their amplitude .",
    "for a given @xmath133 one can find the minimal amplitude of incoming signals @xmath134 and corresponding maximal redshift @xmath135 .",
    "how does the existence of the cut - off frequency ( [ cr ] ) modify these arguments ?",
    "the presence of monopoles may effectively lower the amplitude of the signal from cusp .",
    "let us estimate the minimal mass of monopoles that may affect the amplitude @xmath131 .",
    "there are three regimes of behavior of @xmath136 in dependence of the function @xmath137 , @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the the average number of cusps per loop period ( usually it is taken that @xmath140 ) .",
    "the maximal redshift @xmath141 can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath142 where @xmath143 . inserting ( [ zm ] ) in ( [ cr ] )",
    "we can find from the equation @xmath144 the critical value @xmath145 for which the monopoles suppress the amplitude of the gravitational signal from the network , @xmath146 let us fix the rate of observable gwbs @xmath147 @xmath148 , the frequency @xmath149 ( preferable for detecting gwbs with ligo / virgo ) and find @xmath145 as a function of @xmath150 . from ( [ ecr ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath151 for instance , for strings with @xmath3 we have @xmath152 , while for grand unified theory strings with @xmath153 we find @xmath154 .",
    "thus the monopoles should have masses well beyond the planck mass , which , of course , can not be realized in nature .",
    "therefore we conclude that the presence of monopoles on the string network does not affect the observation of gravitational wave burst from a cosmic string network .    in the end of this section ,",
    "let us consider the gravitational radiation background from hybrid topological defects , formed in the sequence of phase transitions with @xmath10 , ( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of single monopole - antimonopole pairs connected by one string is very different from the one considered above .",
    "this system has a lifetime much less than the hubble time , i.e. does not survive till now . the efficient emission of gravitational waves depends crucially when the phase transition producing monopoles happens . if monopoles are formed after inflation and later get connected by strings ( e.g. as in the langacker - pi model  @xcite ) , the monopole - string system loses most of its energy due to friction with the surrounding plasma and a negligible gravitational wave background results .",
    "however , in another possible scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite traces of topological defects might be left in the form of gravitational waves . in this scenario , monopoles are formed during inflation , but are not swept away completely .",
    "the evolution of the monopole - string system is even during the period of large friction similar to the evolution of `` ordinary '' strings without monopoles , because of the large monopoles separation .",
    "therefore , the monopole - antimonopole pairs connected by strings survive the period of large dumping forces . after that , the string - monopole systems begin to move relativistically and radiate most of their energy into gravitational waves .",
    "martin and vilenkin @xcite estimated the gravitational wave background from such hybrid defects using for the calculations the gravitational spectrum of the oscillating solution .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite do not change strongly for a generic moving monopole - string system , because of two reasons : ( i ) at low frequencies the spectra are almost the same except an unimportant factor @xmath155 and ( ii ) the different dependence of the cut - off frequency on the parameter @xmath12 enters in the formula for the total power emitted only logarithmically . thus the conclusion of ref .  @xcite that the gravitational wave background might be observable by advanced interferometers does not change .",
    "we have studied the radiation of gravitational waves by a `` rotating rod '' , i.e. a rotating monopole - antimonopole pair connected by a cosmic string .",
    "we have found that the dimensionless parameter @xmath12 determines the main features of the emitted spectrum : for not too high mode numbers , @xmath16 , the gravitational wave spectrum can be approximated by @xmath17 , while the gravitational radiation is exponentially suppressed for @xmath18 .",
    "the total gravitational radiation from the rotating rod is given by @xmath156 .",
    "the total power emitted and also the spectrum at not too high frequencies found by us agrees approximately with the spectrum of an oscillating monopole - antimonopole pair connected by a string from ref .",
    "@xcite . only in the high frequency limit differences",
    "appear : while the gravitational radiation is as expected on physical grounds exponentially suppressed for the rotating solution , it decays only as @xmath109 for the oscillating solution .",
    "therefore , we have concluded that the spectrum found by us applies approximately also to the generic case of a superposition of a rotational and oscillatory motion of the monopole - string system .",
    "moreover , studies about the potential of interferometers to observe gravitational wave emitted by topological defect networks that were based on the oscillating solution are valid also for more general motions of the monopole - string systems . we have confirmed that advanced gravitational wave detectors like ligo , virgo and lisa have the potential to detect a signal topological hybrid defects for string tensions as small as @xmath3 .    in munich , this work was supported by an emmy - noether grant of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and in moscow by the russian foundation for basic research , grants 03 - 02 - 16436 and 04 - 02 - 16757 .",

    "if there are no point - like masses on the ends of a string , then the total radiated power diverges because of presents of string points , permanently moving with the speed of light .",

    "the radiated gravitational power falls exponentially ( as can be seen from ( [ app : bessel_asy ] ) and ( [ app : bessel_asy1 ] ) , thus making the sum over all modes finite .",
    "let us calculate now the high - frequency behavior of the gravitational radiation more precisely . for not very high frequencies , @xmath79 , the contribution from monopoles to the gravitational radiation may be neglected . in this case",
