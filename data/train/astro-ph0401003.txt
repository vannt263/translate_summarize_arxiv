    "super massive black holes consisting of at least tens of millions of solar masses are now believed to be lurking in the nuclei of most galaxies .",
    "these dark objects are also the central engines of the most powerful sources of light in the universe : the quasars . discerning the evolution history of smbhs and quasars is a fundamental challenge for the theories of structure formation in the universe .",
    "quasars and other forms of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are thought to be powered by accretion on to the smbhs . by virtue of their enormous brightness",
    "these objects are now observable up to sufficiently high redshifts , corresponding to the dawn of the era of galaxy and star formation in the universe . in the context of hierarchical structure formation",
    ", it is believed that mergers of galaxies play a crucial role in igniting the quasars .",
    "the merger induced gravitational instabilities funnel a huge amount of gas to the galactic cores .",
    "as a fraction of the kinetic energy of this gas is released in the form of electromagnetic radiation , luminosities close to the eddington luminosity ( @xmath1 for a typical@xmath2 smbh masses ) are produced .",
    "nuclear black holes probably trace the merger of their host galaxies and coalesce during mergers .",
    "if one envisages a simple scenario where a dark matter halo harbours a single galaxy and halo merging leads to galaxy merging along with their smbhs , a coalescence dominated growth naturally leads to a linear relation between the black hole and the host halo masses ( see e.g. haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 , hereafter hnr98 ) . the observed correlation between the black hole masses and the bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath3 relation ) of galaxies @xcite , however , suggests that the accreted component of mass far supersedes the coalesced one . the observed scaling is concomitant with a scenario where the energy feedback from the black hole plays a crucial role in regulating the amount of matter accreted on to it @xcite . during the accretion process the mass of the smbh builds up over some characteristic time - scale .",
    "the ratio of this characteristic time - scale to the hubble time determines the duty cycle of a quasar .",
    "accretion shuts down when the black hole is so massive that its energy feedback exceeds the binding energy of its fuel reservoir . indeed , as pointed out by hnr98 and @xcite , the observed scaling can be retrieved if the black hole were to supply the gas with an energy equal to its binding energy over the dynamical time of galaxies .",
    "these intricately woven , yet neat set of ideas sketch an outline for simple models of quasar and smbh evolution .",
    "several analytic and semi - analytic models based on mergers of dark haloes have been proposed to explain the high redshift evolution of quasar luminosity functions ( see for e.g. haehnelt & rees 1993 , hereafter hr93 ; hnr98 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 , hereafter kh00 ; cavaliere & vittorini 2000 , hereafter cv00 ; hosokawa 2002 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 , hereafter wl03 ; hatziminaoglou et al .",
    "2003 ) . simplified analytic models assume that all the cold baryons in a halo are locked in a single galaxy and galaxy mergers trace the halo mergers .",
    "more realistically , the progenitor galaxies in a newly formed halo sink towards the centre over a dynamical friction time - scale ( binney & tremaine 1989 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) and merge to form a new baryonic core . however , as the dynamical friction time - scale is generally much shorter than the hubble time , the approximation that these mergers are instantaneous , works rather well .",
    "galactic mergers are assumed to ignite an agn lasting for a characteristic time @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting luminosities are estimated as eddington luminosities corresponding to central black hole masses , which in turn are determined through their correlation with the circular velocities of the newly formed haloes .",
    "the uncertainty in the mass of cold gas available for accretion poses a key difficulty for the models .",
    "there are two central aspects of this uncertainty : the first is to ascertain how much cold gas is available in galaxies of a given mass at a given epoch @xcite and the second is to understand how effectively this gas is transported via the galaxy mergers to become available for accretion by the forming smbh @xcite .",
    "the predictions of these models can be tested against the backdrop of a fairly well constrained observational data set .",
    "the most striking aspect of this data is that the quasar population peaks at z @xmath5 and exhibits a steep decline towards lower redshifts ( schmidt , schneider & gunn 1995 ; warren , hewett & osmer 1994 ; shaver et al .",
    "1996 ; boyle et al .",
    "2000 ) . at redshifts higher than @xmath6 the number count appears to decline again , however , the observations at these redshift could be marred by obscuration and extinction effects .",
    "simple analytical models mentioned above can well explain the high redshift observed luminosity functions ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "they , however , systematically fail at lower redshifts ( @xmath8 ) and this epoch in the history of the universe is somewhat opaque in our understanding of the evolution of quasars .",
    "even though the works of cv00 , hr93 and kh00 shed important light in this regard , no comprehensive scheme is yet available to systematically quantify the various aspects of quasar evolution at @xmath9 .    the present work is primarily motivated by the low redshift anomaly between observations and theoretical predictions . to bridge this gap",
    "we introduce a toy model centred around two main ideas : the first pertains to the effect of declining black formation efficiency at low redshifts and the second involves a declining black hole formation rate in haloes above some characteristic mass @xmath10 . the first idea is derived from a model investigated in @xcite where it is argued that the conditions for smbh formation are more favourable at higher redshifts as compared to low redshifts .",
    "the second idea is based on the existence of a break luminosity in the empirical quasar luminosity functions .",
    "we attribute this break luminosity to a systematic decoupling between halo and galaxy merger rates in haloes above a characteristic mass along the line suggested by cv00 that galaxy merging becomes rarer in sufficiently massive haloes , where individual galaxies retain their properties . furthermore",
    ", in a similar context , @xcite have argued that a decrease in the quasar luminosity density towards low redshifts arises due to a decline in the formation rates of spheroids .",
    "here we propose a characteristic mass scale @xmath10 for haloes which marks a drop in the formation rates of black holes and thus possibly spheroids as well . as the low redshift universe is an era of group assemblage , our value of @xmath10 which corresponds to a group mass scale seems natural to explain the steep decline observed in the quasar luminosity density at low @xmath11 .",
    "our model entails a phenomenological treatment of the ideas described above .",
    "notwithstanding the crudeness of the approach , it yields interesting results for the the quasar luminosity functions and their evolving number density , broadly consistent with the observations",
    ". it also provides a simple explanation for the evolution of the characteristic luminosity of quasars .",
    "furthermore , the minimum smbh masses for quasars suggested by the model ( by comparison with the observed space density evolution of quasars ) are @xmath12 , which is consistent with the original estimates of @xcite .",
    "finally the model can be linked quite simply with the evolution of cold gas masses in galaxies and star formation rates in the universe and thus yields estimates of the contributions to the ionising background at high redshifts , due to star formation and quasar activity .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we review some important aspects of analytical modelling of hierarchical structure formation which provides the essential tools for our model ; section 3 discusses the relation between the black hole masses and their host haloes in a scenario with a declining efficiency of smbh formation with redshift .",
    "section 4 extends the argument of major mergers of haloes to compute the smbh formation rates and the luminosity functions of the ensuing quasars . in section 5",
    "we compare the smbh formation rates from our model against those inferred from the empirical double power - law fit to the quasar luminosity functions . in section 6",
    "we estimate the mass functions of smbh and the comoving cosmological mass density in the smbh at various redshifts .",
    "section 7 describes how to obtain simple estimates of the cold gas density and star formation rate density in the universe ; section 8 extrapolates these star formation rates to high redshift to compute the ionising background .",
    "these are then compared with a similar extrapolation to high redshifts , of the quasar luminosity density .",
    "we summarise and discuss our results in section 9 .",
    "our approach largely takes advantage of the extended press - schechter ( eps ) formalism which provides essential tools for computing the merger probabilities and rates of bound objects ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ; bower 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 , hereafter lc93 ) . in this scenario",
    "the initial density fluctuations in the universe are assumed to be gaussian in nature .",
    "the growth of these fluctuations proceeds linearly initially and is analysed through the linearised ideal fluid equations ( e.g. silk & bouwens 2001 ) .",
    "the fluctuations subsequently turn non - linear and eventually collapse to form bound objects as the density reaches a critical threshold .",
    "a comparison of eps results with the results of n - body simulations as given in @xcite , demonstrates that the prescription works rather well .",
    "the linear growth of fluctuations is described through the linear growth factor @xmath13 . for a critical cosmology",
    "this factor is simply equal to the scale factor @xmath14 for that epoch . for the @xmath15 cosmology used in this paper ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "we compute it as given in @xcite .",
    "the mass m of an inhomogeneity is represented through a sharp k - space filter which is used to smooth the matter density field at this mass scale .",
    "as suggested in lc93 , @xmath17 can be related to @xmath18 through a qualitative mapping @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the mean background density of matter in the universe . using the dark matter power - spectrum @xmath21 parametrized as in @xcite , the variance for mass scale m",

    "the formation rates , major merger rates and survival probabilities have been discussed by several authors ( e.g. sasaki 1994 ; kitayama & suto 1996 , hereafter ks96 ) . in this context , the excursion set approach of @xcite ( also lc93 ) yields two important conditional probabilities .",
    "the first is the conditional probability that a halo of given mass @xmath26 at time @xmath27 , had a progenitor of mass @xmath28 at earlier time @xmath29 .",
    "this is given as @xmath30 \\d s_1 \\label{p1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the critical density at time @xmath29 and @xmath32 at time @xmath27 . also , @xmath33 is the variance corresponding to mass @xmath28 and @xmath34 is the variance corresponding to @xmath26 .",
    "the relation between the critical density @xmath35 at any time @xmath36 is given as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the present day critical density ( @xmath39 for a scdm cosmology ) .",
    "the second is the probability that a halo of mass @xmath28 at time @xmath29 , will result in a larger halo of mass @xmath26 at later time @xmath27 can be written as @xmath40^{3/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\rm{exp } \\left [ - \\frac{(s_2\\omega_1 - s_1\\omega_2)^2}{2 s_1 s_2(s_1-s_2 ) } \\right ] \\d s_2 . \\label{p2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] through appropriate transformations the conditional probabilities can also be written in terms of halo masses .",
    "the eps formalism lacks a self sufficient way to compute the formation rates of haloes .",
    "this is because effectively all haloes at any epoch are continuously accreting mass and in this sense are newly created .",
    "there is no clear distinction between the objects accreting less mass and the objects which accrete substantial mass . for computing the major merger rates , therefore",
    ", a criterion has to be introduced by hand .",
    "one has to assume that if none of the progenitors of a newly formed object had mass greater than half ( or some other fraction ) of the object mass , the event is a major merger .",
    "alternatively sasaki ( 1994 ) proposed to derive the formation rates by assuming that the destruction probability of objects ( i.e. the probability that they get incorporated into higher mass objects ) has no characteristic mass scale .",
    "this rate is then simply the positive term in the time derivative of the ps mass function . in sasaki s",
    "prescription the survival probability of haloes from one redshift to another is simply the ratio of the growth factors at these redshift .",
    "the product of formation rate and the survival probability defines the formation epoch distribution .",
    "interestingly for a critical cosmology , sasaki s formation epoch distribution can be integrated analytically over all redshifts to yield the exact mass function of haloes .    in the present work we compute the major merger rates based on the prescriptions described in lc93 and ks96.the probability that a given halo of mass @xmath26 at time @xmath27 had , at some earlier time @xmath29 , a progenitor with mass below some threshold mass @xmath41 is computed by integrating equation [ p1 ] over @xmath33 from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "if the difference between the times @xmath29 and @xmath27 is substantial , then @xmath28 can reach the value @xmath26 through either a single merger occurring anytime between @xmath29 and @xmath27 or it can do so through more than one merger / accretion episodes between the two times .",
    "however , if the difference between the two times is very small then the entire change in mass ( @xmath44 ) can be treated as arising from a single merging event . letting @xmath45 we thus write @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the variance corresponding to mass @xmath48 . for small @xmath49 taking the series expansion in equation [ pint ] up to first order only , we compute the major merger rates of dark haloes as @xmath50 where we have chosen @xmath51 .",
    "note that when @xmath47 tends to @xmath52 , the right hand side of equation [ pint ] tends to one , if @xmath49 is small but finite .",
    "this implies that at any given epoch , all the existing objects continuously accrete mass .",
    ".,width=321 ]    as pointed out in lc93 , when the halo mass for a trajectory falls to a smaller value at an earlier time , it only means that _ one _ of the parent haloes had this smaller mass . as a result",
    ", it is always possible that the largest coeval progenitor already has more than half the mass of the final halo at this epoch .",
    "such an event can not be characterised as a major merger as we define it .",
    "the approach of ks does not account for this possibility .",
    "although this marginally alters the rates for the range of halo masses we are concerned with , it is nevertheless interesting to see how one can systematically account for this possibility and therefore , we propose a solution to this problem in appendix a.    equation [ p2 ] can be used to calculate the survival probabilities as discussed in lc93 and ks96 .",
    "these are based on the assumption that an object retains its identity up to the time it doubles its mass .",
    "the probability that a halo of mass @xmath17 at present time @xmath29 , will not undergo such a merger / accretion , before time @xmath27 , which would result in its final mass being greater than @xmath53 , is given as @xmath54    as discussed previously , the survival probability of haloes multiplied with their merger rates , yields their formation epoch distribution .",
    "this distribution tells us that in a given population of mass @xmath17 objects at time @xmath36 , what fraction were formed at an earlier time @xmath55 and have retained their identity since then .",
    "thus the formation epoch distribution in terms of formation time @xmath55 can be written as @xmath56 we show in fig  [ formepoch ] the formation epoch distribution of haloes of different masses as a function of redshift , and in fig  [ cumformrate ] the formation rates of objects with masses above @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "it can be seen from fig  [ cumformrate ] that merger rates of haloes alone do not produce a significant evolution in the number density at low @xmath11 , and therefore a naive model directly linking quasar triggering to merger rates of haloes would fail to match the steep decline which is observed in their number density . hence , we subsequently discuss the additional inputs that need to be incorporated into the model in order to reproduce the observed evolution of the quasar population .    .",
    "these rates ( particularly for @xmath60 , the typical quasar host halo mass ) do not produce as steep a decline at low redshifts as that measured for quasar number counts.,width=321 ]      for a nearly isothermal halo , the mapping between the halo circular velocity and its mass can be obtained using the relations given in @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath11 is the collapse redshift and @xmath62 is the virial radius .",

    "in a self - regulated growth of smbh masses , the correlation between the galaxy circular velocities ( @xmath74 ) and smbh masses ( @xmath75 ) is written as @xcite    8.5 cm    @xmath76    where the constant of proportionality depends on the fraction of cold gas @xmath77 available for accretion by the coalesced seed black hole and weakly on the presence of an accretion disc ( hnr98 ; burkert & silk 2001 ) .",
    "such a scaling is corroborated by the investigations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "incorporating @xmath77 in an analytic model is not simple .",

    "therefore , we get around this problem by adopting an empirically motivated decline in black hole formation efficiency with redshift .",

    "the formation rates of smbhs can be used to compute their formation epoch distribution ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "these can then be integrated over redshift to yield the smbh mass function .",
    "the formation epoch distribution of smbhs can be written as @xmath169 \\ .",
    "\\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , there are two problems with this equation .",
    "the first is that the survival probabilities of smbhs are only crudely correlated to the halo survival probabilities : the declining merger rates of smbh in haloes with mass above @xmath10 suggest that the survival probability may be greater for smbhs in these haloes .",
    "the second problem is more fundamental and lies in the fact that equation [ mbhz ] is not only a function of halo mass but also of formation redshift .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : masses of smbh for a given mass halo will be higher at high redshifts ( this holds even if the formation efficiency is taken as constant such that @xmath170 ) , so that when we compute the destruction probability @xmath171 of objects ( note that @xmath172 ) , we authorise un - realistic situations where a halo with a higher mass black hole goes on to form a lower mass black hole .",
    "hence we underestimate the survival probability .",
    "equation [ fbh1 ] , therefore , only gives a lower limit on the number counts of objects of different masses .",
    "an upper limit can be set by taking @xmath173 .",
    "this amounts to computing mass functions by simply integrating the formation rates up to the redshift of observation .",
    "such an approach has also been considered in @xcite .",
    "thus we write @xmath174 we denote the corresponding smbh mass functions as @xmath175 and @xmath176 respectively .",
    "these are computed as @xmath177 in figure [ bhmf ] we plot the smbh mass functions for several redshifts and compare them with the estimates of local smbh mass function as given in @xcite . at redshifts greater than @xmath178",
    "there appears to be no significant difference in the two limiting mass functions ( @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) .",
    "we can now write the comoving cosmological smbh mass density as @xmath181    figure  [ rhobh ] shows the redshift evolution of cosmological mass density of the smbh with minimum masses @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( top to bottom ) respectively .",
    "the solid lines are computed using @xmath180 and dotted lines are computed using @xmath179 .",
    "it can be seen that mass function @xmath179 gives an unrealistic decline in the mass density of smbh which should increase monotonically .",
    "once again , the reason is that the survival probability of the smbhs are underestimated and thus the number counts are underestimated as well relation combined with the press - schechter mass function . ] .",
    "the density computed using the mass function @xmath180 thus sets an upper limit to the density of smbhs for the three different minimum masses .",
    "12.0 cm    in section 3 we have presented a scenario with a monotonically declining efficiency of black hole formation with decreasing redshift , with @xmath130 relation written as @xmath185 . however , the recent results of @xcite point towards a redshift independence of @xmath3 relation ( and therefore , by extension , @xmath130 relation ) .",
    "they find no discernible change in the relation up to redshift of @xmath186 .",
    "thus they suggest that black holes are well formed by @xmath186 .",
    "in order to reconcile the redshift dependence of our model @xmath130 scaling with observed redshift independence of this relation , we present an argument based on the formation epoch distribution of the smbh . in figure [ fepochbh ]",
    "we plot the formation epoch distribution of smbh of different masses at different redshifts of observation @xmath187 .",
    "it is evident from the figure that most relic smbh between redshifts @xmath188 and @xmath189 were formed at high redshifts @xmath190 . as per our model , at redshifts",
    "@xmath191 , the function @xmath78 does not vary significantly as @xmath192 is a characteristic redshift of decline for @xmath78 .",
    "appreciable decline in @xmath78 occurs only at @xmath193 .",
    "hence , our adopted redshift varying @xmath130 relation does not pose a problem with the observed redshift independence of the relation .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen from figure [ fepochbh ] that using @xmath194 our model predicts that most relic smbh between @xmath188 and @xmath195 , with masses above @xmath196 , are formed between @xmath197 @xmath86 and @xmath198 .",
    "whereas , using @xmath199 we predict that most smbh were formed at @xmath200 .",
    "in our model , the declining black hole formation efficiency is attributed to a corresponding decline in the amount of cold gas mass available in galaxies . to estimate this cold gas mass ,",
    "we take the fraction of cold gas @xmath201 ( which is different from the post merger fraction of cold gas available for accretion - @xmath77 ) in galaxies as proportional to @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath202 . for simplicity we assume that this fraction is independent of halo masses .",
    "we fix the constant of proportionality to match the amount of cold gas observed at high redshift in damped ",
    "ly-@xmath203 systems .",
    "the cooling of gas in massive haloes may be ineffective @xcite and therefore massive haloes may be deficient in cold gas .",
    "we , therefore , tentatively adopt an upper limit to the halo masses which are rich in cold gas as @xmath204 , corresponding to cluster scales .    using these simple prescriptions ,",
    "we can write the mass of cold gas as @xmath205 , where @xmath17 is the halo mass . the comoving cosmological mass density of cold gas can then be written as    @xmath206    we take @xmath163 as the minimum halo mass corresponding to the minimum halo circular velocity @xmath207 for effectively retaining gas in the halo potential well @xcite . to simplify our computation",
    "we calculate @xmath163 corresponding to @xmath208 using equation [ vc ] by setting the redshift of formation as the redshift of observation itself .",
    "this approach has been adopted previously , for example , in @xcite , where they have discussed the error introduced by this simplification .",
    "alternatively one can use the formation epoch distribution and convert it from masses to circular velocities and then integrate over all redshifts up to the redshifts of observation to get the circular velocity functions .    dividing @xmath209 by the critical density @xmath210 of matter in the universe",
    "we obtain @xmath211 .",
    "this is plotted in figure [ gas ] against the observations of damped ",
    "ly-@xmath203 absorbers @xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , we have normalised @xmath211 to the highest redshift data point in figure [ gas ] which yields a constant of proportionality of the order of @xmath212 for the @xmath213 relation , with the exact value depending on the lower circular velocity cut - off used in the computation of @xmath211 .",
    "further , the star formation rates can be estimated by adopting an sfr recipe as ( e.g. sommerville & primack 1999 ) @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the efficiency of star formation and @xmath216 is the cold gas mass available for star formation as described above .",
    "we can thus write the sfr density in the universe as @xmath217    retaining the same normalisation as for the cold gas density , we choose @xmath218 years and an efficiency of 5 percent i.e. @xmath219 . @xmath163 and @xmath220 are as discussed for the case of cold gas density .",
    "figure [ sfrd ] shows the evolution of the sfr density in the universe .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that our crude estimates for the cold gas density and the sfr density are broadly consistent with the data .",
    "this supports our assumption that there exists a correlation between the declining cold gas mass with redshift and the declining efficiency of black hole formation with redshift .",
    "extending the analysis of sfr density and cold gas density in the universe , we now compute the the relative contribution to the ionising background arising from the star formation rates and quasars . in the previous section we computed star formation rates by assuming a direct proportionality between the fraction of cold gas in galaxies and the efficiency of black hole formation . in a more realistic scenario ,",
    "the cold gas content in galaxies builds up gradually , and is controlled primarily by two competing processes .",
    "the first process is that of gas condensation , whereby the gas loses energy over a cooling time scale and falls into the central baryonic core over a dynamical infall time - scale to form stars .",
    "the second process involves the expulsion of a fraction of this gas from the galaxy as a result of feedback from supernovae and agns .",
    "it seems reasonable , therefore , to suppose that the gas content in galaxies evolves dynamically , peaking at some epoch and declining afterwards .",
    "however , in our model the black hole formation efficiency does not peak at high redshifts but reaches a maximum saturating value .",
    "nevertheless , in view of the consistent results for the evolution of @xmath211 and @xmath221 , we bypass the exact evolution history of @xmath78 and @xmath201 by assuming their parallel evolution . this way we compute the maximal evolution of the luminosity densities for star formation rates and the quasars by extrapolating the model @xmath78 to high redshifts .",
    "it is possible that at high redshifts , the evolution of star formation rates as well as the black hole formation rates are driven predominantly by a rapid gravitational growth of structure @xcite .",
    "therefore , at these redshifts the exact evolution of @xmath78 and @xmath201 is perhaps not so important .",
    "now the ultraviolet luminosity arising from star formation can be written as @xcite @xmath222 at @xmath223 , just longward of the hydrogen lyman limit ( e.g. hnr98 ) , the value of @xmath224 for a salpeter imf is given as @xmath225 .",
    "thus the ultraviolet star formation luminosity density is written as @xmath226    for quasars with a minimum black hole mass as @xmath163 , the luminosity density in @xmath227-band can be written as @xmath228.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath229 is the number of active quasars with black hole mass @xmath75 existing at redshift @xmath11 . to convert the @xmath227-band luminosity into luminosity at @xmath230 , we adopt a power law spectral energy distribution scaling as @xmath231 @xcite , where @xmath232 and @xmath233 for a given band is simply @xmath234 . in figure",
    "[ ionback ] , we plot the evolution of luminosity densities due to star formation rates and quasars . these luminosity densities have also been estimated previously , for example , in @xcite . for minimum black hole masses in the range @xmath235 to @xmath236 , we find that the drop in the quasar luminosity density towards low redshifts is steeper than computed in @xcite . for minimum quasar black hole masses of @xmath237",
    "the curves in fig [ ionback ] suggest that at high redshifts , the ionising background is predominantly of stellar origin .",
    "it comes out from our calculations that quasar dominated ionising photon background is plausible if the minimum quasar black hole masses are @xmath238 and the minimum circular velocities for haloes to effectively retain gas are fairly high ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "however , in light of the simplicity of the model used and the uncertainties involved in each of the estimates , these results should only be considered as indicative .",
    "we have presented an empirically motivated model for accretion dominated self - regulated growth of super massive black holes in galaxies and investigated their implications for the evolution of the quasar population in the universe .",
    "the model looks into the core aspects of quasar population such as the space density evolution of quasars , the evolution of the quasar characteristic luminosity , plausible minimum masses of quasars , the mass function of the super massive black holes and the formation epoch distribution of these black holes .",
    "the model suggests that the characteristic luminosity in the quasar luminosity functions arises primarily as a consequence of a characteristic mass - scale above which there is a systematic deviation of the black hole merging rates from the halo merger rates . up to this mass - scale",
    ", the black hole merging appears to be closely following the merging of corresponding dark matter haloes .",
    "this anomalous behaviour is probably a consequence of rarer galaxy merging in massive haloes .",
    "galaxies in massive haloes tend to retain their properties rather than quickly sink to the centre through dynamical friction .",
    "the extent of this effect might depend on the local environment of the merging galaxies .",
    "it is possible , for example , that galactic merging in massive haloes is efficient for high sigma peaks only .",
    "we have mimicked such a behaviour by introducing a simple phenomenological decline in the black hole formation rate through a function @xmath240 with a power law drop at the halo high mass end . when combined with a declining efficiency of black hole formation with redshift which we attribute to a decrease in the cold gas mass available",
    ", the model can reproduce the quasar luminosity function for a wide range of redshifts .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that this declining black hole formation efficiency gives a better comparison of the model break luminosity evolution with the evolution of characteristic luminosity used in the empirical double power - law fit to the data .",
    "on the lines of wl03 , we have modelled time - scales for quasars proportional to the local dynamical time of the newly forming baryonic core , which in turn is proportional to the halo dynamical time .",
    "we found that the local dynamical time gives a better comparison with low redshift observations than the salpeter time - scale .",
    "furthermore , the adopted redshift varying time - scale allows a natural translation of the black hole formation rate density into number density of quasars , consistent with the the observed data .    calculation of the number density evolution of quasars in our model also led us to infer plausible minimum masses of optical quasars on the order of @xmath168 , consistent with the estimates of @xcite who computed minimum masses assuming a radiative efficiency of optical quasars @xmath241 .",
    "additionally , our model suggests a less steep decline of quasar number density at high redshifts than is generally assumed .",
    "we also calculated the evolution of the comoving density of black holes with masses above @xmath237 and @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "the possible reasons for anomalous non - monotonic evolution of @xmath244 inferred from the black hole mass function @xmath179 have been discussed .",
    "we find that for minimum black hole masses of @xmath245 a density of at least @xmath246 has assembled by redshift of 2 .",
    "the absolute upper limit for minimum smbh masses of @xmath247 is @xmath248 .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the estimates of local black hole density ( chokshi & turner 1992 ; salucci et al .",
    "1999 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "our model suggests that a significant fraction of smbh mass density was already in place by @xmath249 .",
    "interestingly , these estimates are also consistent with the recent results of @xcite .",
    "moreover , the model smbh mass functions at @xmath250 are consistent with the local mass function of smbh derived in @xcite .    finally , the predicted ionising background at high redshift appears to be predominantly of stellar origin .",
    "we find that a quasar dominated ionising background would need a lower limit of minimum smbh masses along with a higher value of minimum circular velocities of haloes to effectively retain gas in them .",
    "obscured low mass agns could thus raise the prospects of a quasar dominated ionising background .",
    "however , it is also possible that low mass agns have relatively low radiative efficiencies ( e.g. yu & tremaine 2002 ) and thus may not be able to contribute effectively to the ionising background .",
