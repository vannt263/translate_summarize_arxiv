    "the reader who is familiar with solar neutrino research may wish to skip directly to the last section entitled : what next ?",
    "solar neutrinos have been detected experimentally with fluxes and energies that are qualitatively consistent with solar models that are constructed assuming that the sun shines by nuclear fusion reactions .",
    "the first experimental result , obtained by ray davis and his collaborators in 1968 ,  @xcite has now been confirmed by four other beautiful experiments , kamiokande ,  @xcite sage ,  @xcite gallex ,  @xcite and superkamiokande .",
    "@xcite the observation of solar neutrinos with approximately the predicted energies and fluxes establishes empirically the theory  @xcite that main sequence stars derive their energy from nuclear fusion reactions in their interiors and has inaugurated what we all hope will be a flourishing field of observational neutrino astronomy .",
    "although the calculated neutrino fluxes depend upon high powers of the central temperature of the solar model , the experiments and the solar model theory are so precise that persistent quantitative discrepancies have existed between the model predictions and the solar model calculations for over thirty years  @xcite    important experiments are underway that will provide diagnostic information about the physical properties of neutrinos that are created in the center of the sun and detected on earth in really long baseline experiments . at this workshop",
    ", we will hear discussions of the superkamiokande , sno , borexino , , heron , icarus , lens , and kamland experiments .",
    "i will discuss predictions of the combined standard model in the main part of this review . by ` combined ' standard model , i mean the predictions of the standard solar model and the predictions of the standard electroweak model .",
    "we need a solar model to tell us how many neutrinos of what energy are produced in the sun and we need an electroweak theory to tell us how the number and flavor content of the neutrinos are changed as they make their way from the center of the sun to detectors on earth . for all practical purposes ,",
    "the standard electroweak model states that nothing happens to solar neutrinos after they are created in the deep interior of the sun . using standard electroweak theory and fluxes from the standard solar model",
    ", one can calculate the rates of neutrino interactions in different terrestrial detectors with a variety of energy sensitivities .",
    "the combined standard model also predicts that the energy spectrum from a given neutrino source should be the same for neutrinos produced in terrestrial laboratories and in the sun and that there should not be measurable time - dependences ( other than the seasonal dependence caused by the earth s orbit around the sun ) .",
    "the spectral and temporal departures from standard model expectations are expected to be small in all currently operating experiments  @xcite and have not yet yielded definitive results .",
    "therefore , i will concentrate here on inferences that can be drawn by comparing the total rates observed in solar neutrino experiments with the combined standard model predictions .",
    "i will begin by reviewing in section  [ best ] the quantitative predictions of the combined standard solar model and then describe in section  [ threeproblems ] the three solar neutrino problems that are established by the chlorine , kamiokande , sage , gallex , and superkamiokande experiments . in section  [ uncertainties",
    "] , i detail the uncertainties in the standard model predictions and then show in section  [ helioseismology ] that helioseismological measurements indicate that the standard solar model predictions are accurate for our purposes . in section  [ helioseismology ] , i discuss the implications for solar neutrino research of the precise agreement between helioseismological measurements and the predictions of standard solar models .",
    "next , ignoring all knowledge of the sun , i cite analyses in section  [ nomodels ] that show that one can not fit the existing experimental data with neutrino fluxes that are arbitrary parameters , unless one invokes new physics to change the shape or flavor content of the neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "i summarize in section  [ oscillations ] the characteristics of the best - fitting neutrino oscillation descriptions of the experimental data .",
    "finally , i will discuss and summarize the results in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "if you want to obtain numerical data or subroutines that are discussed in this talk , or to see relevant background information , you can copy them from my web site : http://www.sns.ias.edu/@xmath0jnb .",
    "before we begin the detailed discussion , i want to make just a brief historical diversion .",
    "nearly all of the current interest in solar neutrinos centers around the opportunity to use the sun as a neutrino source in a very long baseline oscillation experiment . in preparing for a talk in honor of fred",
    "reines a few months ago , i ran across a long forgotten 1972 letter from bruno pontecorvo , the originator of the hypothesis that oscillations may be observed in solar neutrino experiments . for your interest ,",
    "i enclose a reproduction of this letter in fig .",
    "[ fig : pontecorvo ] .",
    "-.3 in    for the benefit of neutrino pioneers of today , it is perhaps worth remarking that ray davis and i never considered the possibility that solar neutrinos could be used to learn more about neutrinos when , in the early 1960 s , we were first analyzing the potentialities of a practical chlorine experiment .",
    "we sold the experiment as a fundamental test of the hypothesis that the sun shines by nuclear fusion reactions in its interior .",
    "only after the first results of the chlorine experiment showed in 1968 a conflict with the solar model calculations and gribov and pontecorvo published their epochal 1969 paper on vacuum oscillations of solar neutrinos did we begin to consider the possibility that solar neutrinos might tell us something new about particle physics .",
    "maybe there are previously unimagined physics treasures to be discovered in future neutrino experiments .",
    ".standard model predictions ( bp98 ) : solar neutrino fluxes and neutrino capture rates , with @xmath1 uncertainties from all sources ( combined quadratically ) .",
    "[ tab : bestestimate ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the experimental results from all five of the operating solar neutrino experiments ( chlorine , kamiokande , sage , gallex , and superkamiokande ) can be fit well by descriptions involving neutrino oscillations , either vacuum oscillations ( as originally suggested by gribov and pontecorvo  @xcite)or resonant matter oscillations ( as originally discussed by mikheyev , smirnov , and wolfenstein ( msw )  @xcite ) .",
    "table  [ tab : oscillatesolutions ] summarizes the four best - fit solutions that are found in the two - neutrino approximation .",
    "@xcite only the sma and vacuum oscillation solutions fit well the recoil electron energy spectrum measured in the superkamiokande experiment  if the standard value for the @xmath2 production reaction cross section ( @xmath3 ) is used .",
    "@xcite however , for over a decade i have not given an estimated uncertainty for this cross section .",
    "@xcite the transition matrix element is essentially forbidden and the actual quoted value for the production cross section depends upon a delicate cancellation between two comparably sized terms that arise from very different and hard to evaluate nuclear physics .",
    "i do not see anyway at present to determine from experiment or from first principles theoretical calculations a relevant , robust upper limit to the @xmath2 production cross section ( and therefore the @xmath2 solar neutrino flux ) .",
    "the possible role of @xmath2 neutrinos in solar neutrino experiments is discussed extensively in bahcall and krastev ( 1998 )  @xcite the most important unsolved problem in theoretical nuclear physics related to solar neutrinos is the range of values allowed by fundamental physics for the @xmath2 production cross section .",
    "when the chlorine solar neutrino experiment was first proposed ,  @xcite the only stated motivation was `` ... to see into the interior of a star and thus verify directly the hypothesis of nuclear energy generation in stars . ''",
    "this goal has now been achieved ,    the focus has shifted to using solar neutrino experiments as a tool for learning more about the fundamental characteristics of neutrinos as particles .",
    "experimental effort is now concentrated on answering the question : what are the probabilities for transforming a solar @xmath4 of a definite energy into the other possible neutrino states ?",
    "once this question is answered , we can calculate what happens to @xmath4 s that are created in the interior of the sun .",
    "armed with this information from weak interaction physics , we can return again to the original motivation of using neutrinos to make detailed , quantitative tests of nuclear fusion rates in the solar interior .",
    "measurements of the flavor content of the dominant low energy neutrino sources , @xmath5-@xmath5 and @xmath6be neutrinos , will be crucial in this endeavor and will require another generation of superb solar neutrino experiments ( see the comments in section  [ whatnext ] ) .",
    "three decades of refining the input data and the solar model calculations has led to a predicted standard model event rate for the chlorine experiment , @xmath7 snu , which is very close to @xmath8 snu , the best - estimate value obtained in 1968 .",
    "@xcite the situation regarding solar neutrinos is , however , completely different now , thirty years later .",
    "four experiments have confirmed the original chlorine detection of solar neutrinos .",
    "helioseismological measurements are in excellent agreement with the standard solar model predictions and very strongly disfavor ( by a factor of @xmath9 or more ) hypothetical deviations from the standard model that are require to fits the neutrino data ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ modelsunnu ] ) .",
    "just in the last two years , improvements in the helioseismological measurements have resulted in a five - fold improvement in the agreement between the calculated standard solar model sound speeds and the measured solar velocities ( cf .",
    "figure  2 of the neutrino  96 talk  @xcite with figure  [ modelsunnu ] of this talk ) .",
    "more than @xmath10% of the calculated standard model solar neutrino flux lies below @xmath11 mev .",
    "the rare @xmath12b neutrino flux is the only solar neutrino source for which measurements of the energy have been made , but @xmath12b neutrinos constitute a fraction of less than @xmath13 of the total solar neutrino flux .",
    "the next goal of solar neutrino astronomy is to measure neutrino fluxes below @xmath11 mev .",
    "we should begin today preparing for experiments that will measure the @xmath6be neutrinos ( energy of @xmath14 mev ) and the fundamental @xmath5-@xmath5 neutrinos ( @xmath15 mev ) .",
    "indeed , we have heard at this workshop some marvelously exciting descriptions of how such low energy experiments could be carried out .",
    "the borexino observatory , which can detect @xmath16 scattering , is the only approved solar neutrino experiment which can measure energies less than @xmath11 mev .",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath5 neutrinos are overwhelmingly the most abundant source of solar neutrinos , carrying about @xmath17% of the total flux according to the standard solar model .",
    "the @xmath6be neutrinos constitute about @xmath18% of the total standard model flux .",
    "if we want to test and to understand neutrino oscillations with high precision using solar neutrino sources , then we have to measure the neutrino - electron scattering rate with @xmath6be neutrinos , as will be done with the borexino experiment , and also the cc ( neutrino - absorption ) rate with @xmath6be neutrinos ( no approved experiment ) . with a neutrino line",
    "as provided by @xmath6be electron - capture in the sun , unique and unambiguous tests of neutrino oscillation models can be carried out if one knows both the charged - current and the neutral current reaction rates  @xcite .",
    "i believe we have calculated the flux of @xmath5-@xmath5 neutrinos produced in the sun to an accuracy of @xmath19% .",
    "unfortunately , we do not yet have a direct measurement of this flux .",
    "the gallium experiments only tell us the rate of capture of all neutrinos with energies above @xmath20 mev .",
    "the most urgent need for solar neutrino research is to develop a practical experiment to measure directly the @xmath5-@xmath5 neutrino flux and the energy spectrum of electrons produced by target interactions with @xmath5-@xmath5 neutrinos .",
    "such an experiment can be used to test the precise and fundamental standard solar model prediction of the @xmath5-@xmath5 neutrino flux .",
    "moreover , the currently favored neutrino oscillation solutions all predict a strong influence of oscillations on the low - energy flux of @xmath4 .",
    "-.6 in    figure  [ fig : survival ] shows the calculated neutrino survival probability as a function of energy for three global best - fit msw oscillation solutions .",
    "you can see directly from this figure why we have to have accurate measurements for the @xmath5-@xmath5 and @xmath6be neutrinos : the currently favored solutions exhibit their most characteristic and strongly energy dependent features below @xmath11 mev . in all of these solutions ,",
    "the survival probability shows a dramatic increase with energy below @xmath11 mev , whereas in the region above @xmath21 mev ( accessible to superkamiokande and to sno ) the energy dependence of the survival probability is at best modest .",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath5 neutrinos are the gold ring of solar neutrino astronomy .",
    "their measurement will constitute a simultaneous and critical test of stellar evolution theory and of neutrino oscillation solutions .",
    "the most exciting result of this workshop for me has been the possibility discussed here of a synergistic experiment involving a huge ( megaton ? ) nucleon decay detector in which an inner region is reserved for solar neutrino experiments(see , for example , the talks by jung , nakahata , and ypsilantis at this workshop ) .",
    "the most straightforward solar neutrino experiments that could be carried out with this detector would be precision measurements of the temporal dependences of the relatively high - energy @xmath12b neutrinos .",
    "one could measure with such a detector the zenith - angle dependence of the solar neutrino - event rate ( the generalization of the day - night difference ) and the seasonal dependence ( generalization of the winter - summer difference ) .",
    "the design could relax somewhat the precise requirements for energy calibration and for energy resolution used for the superkamiokande and sno experiments and concentrate instead on limiting the systematic uncertainties in the detector that could contribute to the error budget in the day - night or seasonal dependences .",
    "after three years of very careful measurements , the superkamiokande experiment has , as we have heard at this conference , about a @xmath22 result for the day - night difference .",
    "they do not yet have the statistics to report a meaningful measurement of the full zenith - angle dependence or the seasonal dependence .",
    "the predicted temporal effects are small , generally of order a percent , with the currently favored neutrino oscillation solutions .",
    "nature has provided us with many different baselines and with many different matter column densities with which to do very long baseline ( vlb ) studies of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the earth - sun distance varies continuously during the year between @xmath23 cm and the column density through the earth to a terrestrial detector varies from @xmath24 during the day to more than @xmath25 at night .    a solar neutrino detector ten or more times the volume of the current superkamiokande experiment , as discussed in concept at this workshop , could measure precisely the results of many different vlb neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "this would be a fantastic ` smoking gun ' detector .",
    "i have a hard time sitting down when imagining such an exciting possibility .",
