    "insulation of dielectrics is limited due to dielectric breakdown @xcite . there",
    "exist several different physical mechanisms which lead to instabilities associated with dielectric breakdown at high electric fields , e.g. , thermal runaway and impact ionization avalanches . at breakdown ,",
    "a change from an insulating to a conducting state occurs , at least in a certain spatial region and for a certain time .",
    "a release of charge carriers is possible from two different sources .",
    "first , carriers can be generated intrinsically via a bulk instability , e.g. , by ionization of impurities .",
    "secondly , carriers can enter due to injection at the electrodes . in this paper , we show that charge injection is associated with an instability , too .",
    "in contrast to bulk instabilities , however , charge injection is a boundary instability where the unstable mode ( charge injection mode ) is localized at the injecting contact .",
    "+ in practice , charge injection in macroscopic insulating bodies occurs at geometrical defects of the electrodes where the electric field can be strongly enhanced . below we will consider concentric cylindrical and spherical contact geometries .",
    "a small inner electrode has a large electric field and can serve as a model for a field enhancing defect .",
    "the cylindrical system describes also a coaxial cable filled with a dielectric medium ; a system which is of obvious technical interest .",
    "+ charge injection in dielectrics has been investigated experimentally for a tip - plate geometry by hibma and zeller @xcite , and has been modeled by zeller and schneider @xcite in the limit of an infinitely high mobility edge and by neglecting diffusion .",
    "they describe the mobility edge with a mobility @xmath0 which vanishes for @xmath1 but which is very large for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a critical value of the electric field ( @xmath4v / cm ) . in this model a space charge forms near the tip when the local field reaches the mobility edge . the space charge , in turn , screens the electric field enhancement at the tip and pins it to the mobility edge ( field limiting space charge ) .",
    "zeller and collaborators assume a bulk instability at @xmath3 associated with s - shaped negative differential conductivity which forms the basis of their theory of injection @xcite .",
    "below we show , however , that there is no need for such an underlying bulk instability .",
    "charge injection turns out to be an instability by itself .",
    "+ boggs @xcite pointed out the usefulness of the screening by the injected space charge in ac driven field - grading materials .",
    "his model , however , is based on the concept of conductivity which can not lead to a consistent physical description of charge injection .",
    "the theory assumes a conductivity which is only a function of the field and which does not distinguish between intrinsic and injected charge carriers .",
    "note that charge injection is a boundary effect , while conductivity is a bulk quantity associated with intrinsic carriers .",
    "boggs approach leads , nonetheless , to qualitatively correct ac results in the limit of an infinitely sharp mobility edge and in a certain frequency regime .",
    "+ for the sake of clearness , we will consider a perfect insulator , which is defined here as a dielectric without intrinsic carriers and with a constant permittivity @xmath5 .",
    "electrons or holes can be present only due to injection at the electrodes . without charge injection ,",
    "a voltage difference at the contacts induces a charge which is located outside the dielectric in a thin surface layer ( with a thickness of the very short debye length ) of the metal contacts .",
    "we call this locally neutral state of the insulator the _ ideal insulating state_. the electric field in the insulator is then uniquely determined by the laplace equation .",
    "the electric field at the contacts is fully determined by the potential differences of the contacts .",
    "clearly , this situation corresponds to a purely capacitive arrangement of the contacts in a dielectric medium . +",
    "a prescription of arbitrary boundary conditions to the electric field at the contacts ( e.g. , @xmath6 ) is more restrictive and in general implies the presence of a space charge in the dielectric medium .",
    "the field is then determined by the poisson equation .",
    "important work on charge injection @xcite treats the formation of a space charge in this way as a direct consequence of boundary conditions .",
    "these theories treat the charged state , but they do not consider the stability of the locally neutral state .",
    "+ a different approach which is appropriate for metal - semiconductor contacts is to prescribe a richardson - schottky @xcite or a fowler - nordheim @xcite current - field characteristic in order to model thermionic ( field ) emission or a tunneling current through the contact barrier , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the well - defined metal - semiconductor micro - contacts manufactured by a highly developed semiconductor technology , macroscopic metal - insulator contacts used in high - voltage devices are not well - defined and can thus not be treated on a microscopic level .",
    "a description on a hydrodynamic level is then more appropriate .",
    "therefore , we prescribe phenomenological boundary conditions to the charge density @xmath7 .",
    "additional boundary conditions to the electric field are unnecessary . in principle , the parameters occurring in the boundary conditions should be derived from microscopic models , provided the physics at the contacts is known . for homogeneous boundary conditions , it turns out that the locally neutral state ( @xmath8 ) is always a stationary solution of the problem .",
    "however , we will show that this ideal insulating state can become unstable against a charge injecting mode or that bistability of neutral and charged state can occur .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce a model for the perfect insulator with phenomenological boundary conditions . in sect .",
    "[ stability ] , we investigate the charge injection instability of the ideal insulating state . the steady state which eventually developes is discussed in sect . [",
    "charged ] .",
    "finally , in sect [ acdriven ] , we present numerical results for an ac biased perfect insulator .",
    "we consider a material with electron - hole symmetry and with an immediate recombination of electrons ( @xmath9 ) and holes ( @xmath10 ) by annihilation .",
    "this means that the mobilities and the diffusion constants of electrons and holes have equal absolute values , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "an einstein relation is not considered for the present nonequilibrium system , and we assume that @xmath13 is a field independent constant . due to the fast electron - hole recombination , the carrier density is equal to the absolute value of the charge density .",
    "the drift current is then simply given by @xmath14 .",
    "dynamic equations for electrons and holes describing generation - recombination processes do not appear . we emphasize that , except for the ac results , all results below are valid also for unipolar conduction and are not consequences of the electron - hole symmetry and of the fast recombination .",
    "in particular , the injection instability discussed below occurs for unipolar conduction .",
    "+ consider now a perfect insulator in a capacitor of cylindrical or of spherical symmetry .",
    "metal contacts are attached at the inner and the outer radius , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . in the following ,",
    "the cylindrical capacitor of length @xmath17 and the spherical capacitor are labeled with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",

    "( [ eq2b ] ) for the analytical discussion .",
    "+ the system is driven electrically via a coupling to an external electric circuit , which consists here of a voltage bias @xmath32 and an ohmic resistor , @xmath33 , in series .",
    "the total ( radial ) current density @xmath34 is determined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the cylindrical and the spherical case , respectively .",

    "an increase of @xmath33 corresponds to forcing a current which requires the presence of charge and is thus expected to lower the stability of the ideal insulating state .",
    "voltage control can equivalently be expressed in the form @xmath39 . + in order to have a well - defined problem we specify mixed homogeneous boundary conditions to the charge density @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a phenomenological parameter , and where @xmath42 and @xmath43 refers to @xmath15 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "some remarks concerning this boundary condition are in order .",
    "first , a restriction to homogeneous boundary conditions is not necessary .",
    "an additional inhomogeneity in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) leads to a finite boundary charge . in this paper ,",
    "however , we want to show that charge injection occurs even for homogeneous boundary conditions where a locally neutral state exists .",
    "secondly , @xmath41 can depend on the local electric field .",
    "such nonlinear boundary conditions can lead to instabilities .",
    "below we show , that even for the linear case an instability occurs , and we discuss the behavior of the perfect insulator as a function of @xmath41 . thirdly , we assume that the charge does not ` wet ' the contacts , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "this is reasonable if the microscopic contact potential has the shape of a barrier . in a purely diffusive system ,",
    "a ` wetting ' density leads to an instability of the uniform state . for homogeneous neumann boundary conditions ( @xmath46 )",
    "which describe contacts with vanishing diffusion current , the ideal insulating state in the diffusive regime is marginally stable ( gapless stability spectrum ) .",
    "indeed , an arbitrary spatially uniform @xmath7 is a solution in the linear diffusive regime which implies the existence of a zero mode . for finite negative @xmath47 ,",
    "the @xmath8 state is stable in this regime . in the following section",

    "equation ( [ eq9 ] ) can be obtained by a projection onto the translation mode of the domain wall and has the simple interpretation that the front travels with the drift velocity of the carriers .",
    "+ it should be noted that the slowness of the charge redistribution indicates a strong dependence on weak perturbations of the homogeneous insulator bulk . while weak forces are not expected to hinder the growth of the fast unstable injection mode , the charge redistribution can be considerably influenced by traps , grain boundaries etc .",

    "<S> we show that in a macroscopic perfect insulator , charge injection at a field - enhancing defect is associated with an instability of the insulating state or with bistability of the insulating and the charged state . the effect of a nonlinear carrier mobility is emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of the charged state is governed by two different processes with clearly separated time scales . </S>",
    "<S> first , due to a fast growth of a charge - injection mode , a localized charge cloud forms near the injecting defect ( or contact ) . </S>",
    "<S> charge injection stops when the field enhancement is screened below criticality . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the charge slowly redistributes in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the linear instability mechanism and the final charged steady state are discussed for a simple model and for cylindrical and spherical geometries . </S>",
    "<S> the theory explains an experimentally observed increase of the critical electric field with decreasing size of the injecting contact . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are presented for dc and ac biased insulators . </S>"
