    "recently sub - diffusion processes have attracted increasing interest since the introduction of continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) in @xcite and a large number of contributions have been given to them ( @xcite , @xcite ) . since ctrw is a random walk subordinated to a simple renewal process , by @xcite , it can be regarded as a generalized physical diffusion process ( including the sub - diffusion process and the super - diffusion process ) and there exists a closed connection between the time fractional diffusion system and the sub - diffusion process .",
    "moreover , it is confirmed in @xcite and @xcite that the time fractional diffusion systems can be used to well characterize those sub - diffusion processes , which offer better performance not achievable before using conventional diffusion systems and surely raise many potential research opportunities at the same time .    in the case of diffusion system",
    ", it is well known that in general , not all the states can be reached in the whole domain of interest .",
    "so here , we first introduce some notations on the regional controllability of time fractional diffusion systems when the system under consideration is only exactly ( or approximately ) controllability on a subset of the whole space , which can be regarded as an extensions of the research work in ( @xcite , @xcite ) . besides",
    ", focusing on regional controllability would allow for a reduction in the number of physical actuators , offer the potential to reduce computational requirements in some cases , and also possible to discuss those systems which are not controllable on the whole domain , etc .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite and @xcite , the authors have shown that the measurements and actions in practical systems can be better described by using the notion of actuators and sensors ( including the location , number and spatial distribution of actuators and sensors @xcite ) .",
    "then the contribution of this present work is on the regional controllability of the sub - diffusion processes described by riemann - liouville time fractional diffusion systems of order @xmath2 by using the notion of actuators and sensors .",
    "as cited in @xcite , their applications are rich in many real life .",
    "for example , the flow through porous media ( @xcite ) , or the swarm of robots moving through dense forest ( @xcite ) .",
    "we hope that the results here could provide some insights into the qualitative analysis of the design and configuration of fractional controller .",

    "our main results on the regional controllability analysis of time time fractional diffusion systems are presented and the determination of the optimal control which achieves the regional controllability is obtained .",
