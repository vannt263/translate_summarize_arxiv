    "spatially separated quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron - hole plasma can be found in different modern nano - heterostructure - based devices . there is a continuous attention to closely situated ( so called double ) quantum wells .",
    "this attention is mostly due to the possibility of the bose - einstein condensation of spatially indirect excitons in such a system@xcite .",
    "another physical object with spatially separated electron - hole plasma , which currently attracts increasing interest , is a gan / algan quantum well , grown on a sapphire substrate@xcite . in the latter case electrons and holes are separated by huge ( of the order of one mv / cm ) internal electric field . because of the enhanced binding energy in wide - gap semiconductors , excitons in nitride - based nanostructures are a subject of extensive experimental and theoretical research .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide a consistent many - body theory , describing statistical mechanics of the quasi-2d exciton / free carrier plasma with spatial charge separation .",
    "first of all , the potentials of electron - electron and electron - hole interaction should be established .",
    "the thomas - fermi ( or , as it is often called in the 2d case , stern - howard ) approximation is one of the most frequently used methods for dealing with static screening of coulomb interaction in semiconductor systems@xcite . in the frame of this approximation",
    "the charge , induced by external perturbation , originates from a redistribution of free carriers and is proportional to a local electric field .",
    "the resulting electric field potential is given by the poisson equation in the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is a free - carrier - distribution function in the direction normal to the quantum well plane , @xmath3 is a background dielectric constant , @xmath4 is an external charge density , and the screening parameter in the 2d case is @xmath5 .",
    "\\label{qs}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 is a free particle density , @xmath7 is a quasi - fermi level , @xmath8 is an effective mass , @xmath9 is the reduced effective mass , @xmath10 is the 3d exciton bohr radius , and @xmath11 .",
    "the contribution of excitons to screening in the conventional single quantum well can be treated within the thomas - fermi approximation as a reduction of free carrier densities entering eq.([qs ] ) . in the case of spatially separated plasma ,",
    "screening by excitons can not be neglected even in the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "the indirect exciton has the finite dipole moment , and the external electric field causes redistribution of excitons , which plays its own role in the resulting field reduction .",
    "using the same approach as for a free - carrier plasma , the indirect - exciton part of the induced charge density can be written as @xmath12.\\ ] ] here we introduced the excitonic screening parameter @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the exciton density and @xmath15 .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a simple model of spatially separated electron - hole plasma , where electrons and holes are purely two - dimensional and reside in different planes with distance @xmath16 between them .",
    "the generalization of this model to incorporate finite - width quantum wells will be presented somewhere else . the two - plane model is particularly valuable for studying the interplay between screening and spatial separation of different types of carriers .",
    "the problem of finding electron - electron repulsion and electron - hole attraction potentials has cylindrical symmetry , so we use the following representation : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the bessel function .",
    "let us assume that the electronic charge resides in the plane with coordinate @xmath19 and the holes are in the plane @xmath20 . in this model the distribution functions",
    "@xmath2 are given by delta - functions .",
    "the poisson equation is reduced to a one - dimensional problem : @xmath21 @xmath22 = -\\frac{4\\pi e}{\\kappa}\\delta(z - d ) \\label{ep3}\\ ] ] solving eq.([ep3 ] ) , we obtain repulsion and attraction potentials in @xmath23-representation : @xmath24 @xmath25 where both terms @xmath26 [ 2k+(q_s^e+q_s^h)(1+\\exp(-qd ) ) ] , $ ] and @xmath27 in denominators of eqs.([veh2],[vee2 ] ) do not depend on the excitonic screening parameter @xmath28 .",
    "in order to provide a consistent treatment of many - body effects in a 2d electron - hole plasma , we base our theory on a quasi - particle picture and green functions technique .",
    "electrons and holes are redistributed among the quasi - particle states with a sharp spectral peak and dispersion @xmath29 ( where the energy is measured from the corresponding size - quantized level renormalised by the many - body shift ) and some other `` correlated '' states originating from the interaction between quasi - particles .",
    "the total density of electrons can be divided into two parts , the first part representing `` free '' particles with a quasi - fermi level @xmath30 , and the second part incorporating interaction between quasiparticles .",
    "this second part , which is called the correlated density , is given@xcite by @xmath31 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\hbar\\omega } \\frac{\\rm p}{\\epsilon_e(k)-\\hbar\\omega}. \\label{korplot}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 is an imaginary part of the single - particle self - energy , @xmath33^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution function , and the derivative of the principal value is given @xmath34 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] from the point of view of diagrammatic technique , exciton is a succession of electron - hole scatterings , which is represented by the series of diagrams serving as a basis for the ladder approximation@xcite .",
    "we use the ladder approximation to our many - body problem , keeping only ladder - type diagrams in the expression for the electron self energy : @xmath35 g_b(-\\vec{k } , \\omega_b),\\ ] ] where the summation is taken over different types of particles , @xmath36 , 2d wave - vector @xmath37 and fermi - type matsubara frequencies @xmath38 . the quantity @xmath39 represents a sum of ladder diagrams for electron - electron or electron - hole scattering and",
    "is given by the frequency - dependent t - matrix equation : @xmath40 @xmath41 where the potentials @xmath42 are given by eqs.([veh2],[vee2 ] ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44 following zimmermann @xcite , who derived a similar formula for the 3d case , we obtain the expression for the correlated density in the 2d electron - hole system : @xmath45 , \\label{omal}\\ ] ] @xmath46,\\ ] ] @xmath47 here @xmath48 are the values of the exciton bound state energies , where the first index @xmath49 denotes the angular momentum and the second index @xmath50 numerates different states for a given @xmath49 .",
    "the bound state energies correspond to the poles of the t - matrix .",
    "the quantities @xmath51 give the phases of the coefficients in the fourier series expansion of the t - matrix .",
    "the values of these quantities coincide with the scattering phase shifts when the k - space filling is neglected .",
    "thus , the second part of eq.([omal ] ) describes the scattering states contribution to the correlated density . in the low density / high temperature limit",
    "this expression differs from that of portnoi and galbright @xcite only by the factor @xmath52 in the integrand .",
    "the `` e - e '' part of the correlated density has a negative sign and is responsible for the reduction of the plasma density due to repulsion between the carriers of the same type .",
    "the electron - hole part of the density is positive and can be attributed to the presence of the excitons .",
    "as it was shown in ref.@xcite for dilute plasma , this part of the density does not change abruptly when one of the bound states disappears with increasing screening .",
    "we treat the electron - hole part of the correlated density as the density of excitons : @xmath53 .",
    "\\label{nexc}\\ ] ] substituting @xmath14 from eq.([nexc ] ) into eq.([qsexc ] ) we get the following expression for the excitonic screening parameter : @xmath54 , \\label{qse}\\ ] ] @xmath55^{-1}.\\ ] ] to calculate the exciton density we have to run the following self - consistent procedure .",
    "firstly , for given electron - hole density we calculate the screening parameters from eq.([qs ] ) and obtain corresponding bound state energies and phase shifts .",
    "then , using these results we calculate the new values of excitonic screening parameter and free carrier density and recalculate bound state energies and phase shifts , repeating this procedure until the exciton density stops changing .",
    "throughout the calculations we neglect the phase shift dependence on the carrier density and obtain the values of @xmath56 using the 2d modification@xcite of the variable phase approach . to find the bound state energies we use the method , proposed by campi and co - workers@xcite , which is also based on the ladder approximation .",
    "we take into account only the ground exciton state .",
    "the material parameters are chosen to match these of the gaas / algaas quantum wells , and the difference between dielectric constants of the qw and the barrier is neglected .    in figure 1",
    "we present the dependence of the binding energy of the exciton ground state on the inter - plane distance .",
    "one can see ( fig .",
    "1b ) that the decrease of the exciton binding energy with increasing the distance is substantially enhanced by the presence of free carriers and indirect excitons , which screen the coulomb attraction .",
    "figure 2 shows the exciton density as a function of the total plasma density for different inter - plane distances .",
    "one can see that the exciton density has a maximum and then decreases sharply with increasing the total number of carriers , which reflects the action of both screening and k - space filing .",
