    "the basic idea of the quantum degeneracy point approach is to use finite energy splitting of a qubit to protect the qubit from transverse low - frequency noise . consider a qubit coupling to low - frequency noise as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy splitting between the qubit states @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the noise amplitude with @xmath5 .",
    "the noise couples to the qubit via the @xmath6 operator where only the off - diagonal matrix elements are nonzero , and is hence a transverse noise .",
    "we treat the noise @xmath4 as a classical noise for the simplicity of discussion , but our results can be applied to quantum noises .",
    "the low - frequency nature of the noise determines that it can not resonantly excite the qubit between its two states due to the large energy splitting of the qubit .",

    "the above hamiltonian can be approximated as @xmath7 where the qubit adiabatically follows the time dependence of the noise via a second - order term @xmath8 .",
    "qubit dephasing is determined by this second - order term and is significantly suppressed by a factor of @xmath9 @xcite .    however , as we mentioned in sec.[sec introduction ] , the qubit - noise coupling in real systems can be more general than that in eq.([equa single sample ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we consider a model of arbitrary low - frequency noise @xmath10 which includes coupling to all three pauli matrices of the qubit .",
    "we will show that an encoded subspace can be constructed in which this noise can be converted to an effective transverse noise .",
    "consider two qubits with the hamiltonian @xmath11 where the @xmath12 s are the pauli matrices of the @xmath13-th qubit and @xmath14 .",

    "this observation shows that the uqdp approach can be applied to a variety of superconducting qubits as well as other quantum systems such as the ion trap system @xcite .",
    "the uqdp approach is different from the decoherence free subspace ( dfs ) approach that has been widely studied @xcite .",
    "the dfs approach protects the qubits against spatially correlated noises by choosing a subspace that is immune to such noise , i.e. , the decoherence is suppressed by the symmetry of the noise . while in our scheme",
    ", we exploit the energy splitting of the encoded qubit and the low - frequency nature of the noise ( the noise can not resonantly excite transitions between states with large energy splitting ) to protect the quantum state .",
    "in conclusion , we propose a uqdp approach to protect the superconducting qubits from arbitrary low - frequency noise . using two coupled qubits to form an encoded qubit",
    ", we find a subspace where the low - frequency noise only causes dephasing in quadratic order .",
    "we show that universal quantum logic gates can be performed on the encoded qubits with high fidelity .",
    "the approach is robust against parameter spreads due to fabrication errors .",
    "we also show that this scheme can be realized with a qubit coupling with a superconducting resonator .",
    "furthermore , this approach can be applied to a broad range of physical systems to reduce the effect of low - frequency noise .",
