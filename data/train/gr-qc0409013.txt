    "it is well known that quasinormal modes possess a discrete spectra of complex characteristic frequencies which are entirely fixed by the structure of the background spacetime and are irrelevant of the initial perturbations@xcite .",
    "thus , one can directly identify a black hole existence through comparing the quasinormal modes with the gravitational waves observed in the universe .",
    "meanwhile , it is generally believed that the study of the quasinormal modes may lead to a deeper understanding of black holes and quantum gravity because that the quasinormal frequency spectra is related to the ads / cft correspondence , string theory and loop quantum gravity@xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , much attention has been devoted to the study of the quasinormal modes in the recent thirty years@xcite-@xcite . in the schwarzschild spacetime",

    "first conjectured that the real parts of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies of a schwarzschild black hole can be expressed as @xmath4 .",
    "together with bohr s correspondence principle , the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the asymptotic quasinormal modes , he also obtained some new information about the quantization of area at a black hole event horizon .",
    "using of hod s conjecture , dreyer@xcite found that the quasinormal modes can entirely fixed the barbero - immirzi parameter@xcite , which was introduced as an indefinite factor by immirzi to obtain the right form of the black hole entropy in the loop quantum gravity .",
    "most significantly , the presence of @xmath5 also means that the gauge group in the loop quantum gravity should be @xmath6 rather than @xmath7 .",
    "thus , one suggested that hod s conjecture maybe create a new way to probe the quantum properties of black hole .",
    "however , the question whether hod s conjecture applies to more general black holes still remain open .",
    "recently , we probed the asymptotic quasinormal modes of a massless scalar field in the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton spacetime@xcite and find that the frequency spectra formula satisfies hod s conjecture .",
    "cardoso and abdalla @xcite@xcite found the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in the schwarzschild de sitter and anti - de sitter spacetimes depend on the cosmological constant . only under the condition that the cosmological constant vanishes , the real parts of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies returns to @xmath1 .",
    "for the reissner - nordstrm black hole , l. motl and a.neitzke@xcite obtained the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies is relevant of the electric charge @xmath8 .",
    "it is unfortunately that the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies do not return returns @xmath1 as the black hole charge @xmath8 tends to zero .",

    "this black hole has an event horizon at @xmath17 and two singular points at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    ". however , in the monodromy method , it is fundamental to extend analytically eq.([e3 ] ) to the whole complex @xmath37-plane . in the process of analytical extension",
    ", we find that both the tortoise coordinate @xmath38 and the wave function @xmath39 are multivalued around the singular points @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "this multivaluedness plays an important and essential role in our analysis . as in ref.@xcite",

    ", we can obtain the asymptotic quasinormal frequency spectra in the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton black hole spacetime .    from eq.([x2 ] ) , we find that @xmath41 is not uniquely defined as a function of @xmath37 . however , it is very fortunate that we can determine the sign of @xmath42 in the complex @xmath37-plane .",

    "the regions with the hachures denote the area @xmath43.,width=226 ]    [ fig1 ]    as in ref.@xcite , in order to compute conveniently , we may introduce the variable @xmath44 . for @xmath25",

    "similarly to ref.@xcite , we can analytically continue @xmath39 via  wick rotation \" to the line @xmath50 . for the highly damped modes ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath51 are almost purely imaginary , the line @xmath50 is just slightly sloped off the line @xmath52 . assuming initially that @xmath53 and then making use of the condition @xmath50 , we can obtain @xmath54 is rotated to @xmath55 .",
    "thus , on the line @xmath52 , the boundary condition at @xmath56 actually becomes @xmath57    let us now compute the local monodromy around the singular point @xmath23 .",
    "this can be done by matching the asymptotic along the line @xmath52 , i.e. , the contour @xmath40 shown in the fig",
    "when we start at point @xmath58 and move along the contour @xmath40 towards interior , the @xmath59 can be look as the plane waves because the term @xmath60 dominates the potential in eq.([e3 ] ) away from the origin point . at the vicinity of the point @xmath25",

    "after considering the asymptotic behavior of @xmath67 as @xmath68 , we can select the normalization factors @xmath69 in ( [ j1 ] ) so that we can write the asymptotic forms as @xmath70 as @xmath68 , where @xmath71 . from eqs.([j1 ] ) , ( [ j2 ] ) and the boundary condition ( [ b1 ] ) , we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 to follow the contour @xmath40 and approach to the point @xmath74 , we have to turn an angle @xmath75 around the origin @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath76 around @xmath45 . from the bessel function behavior near the origin point @xmath77 where @xmath78 is an even holomorphic function ,",
    "we find that after the @xmath76 rotation the asymptotic are @xmath79 as @xmath80 .",
    "thus the asymptotic at the point @xmath74 @xmath81 finally , we can come back from the point @xmath74 to the point @xmath58 along the large semicircle in the right half - plane . in this region",

    "when we return to the point @xmath58 , the coefficient of @xmath84 remains unchange .",
    "while the coefficient of @xmath85 makes only an exponentially small contribution to @xmath86 in the right plane . finally , we find that the monodromy around the contour @xmath40 must multiply the coefficient of @xmath84 by a factor @xmath87    now , let us calculate the global monodromy around the contour @xmath40 . since the only singularity of @xmath39 or @xmath84 inside the contour occurs at the point @xmath23 , according to the boundary condition of the quasinormal modes , we can obtain the monodromy of @xmath39 or @xmath84 at this point .",
    "after a full clockwise round trip , @xmath39 acquires a phase @xmath88 , while @xmath84 acquires a phase @xmath89 .",

    "this means that the asymptotic quasinormal modes depend not only on the structure parameters of the background spacetimes , but also on the coupling between the matter fields and gravitational field .",
    "furthermore , we find only when @xmath94 , namely , in the minimal couple case , the real part of the right - hand side of the formula ( [ 12 ] ) becomes @xmath5 , which is consistent with hod s conjecture .",

    "it is shown that the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies depend not only on the structure parameters of the background spacetime , but also on a couple constant @xmath0 .",
    "the fact tells us that the interaction between the matter fields and gravitational field will affect the frequencies spectra formula of the asymptotic quasinormal modes .",
    "it is a novel property of the quasinormal modes in garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton spacetime . in the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm spacetimes",
    ", we find the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies do not possess this behavior because the curvature scalar @xmath28 in both the spacetimes is equal to zero and then the coupled term in eq.([eq1 ] ) vanishes .",
    "moreover , we find that hod s conjecture , the real parts of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies equals to @xmath95 , is valid only for the minimal couple case in the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton spacetime , i.e. , @xmath0 becomes zero .",
    "it implies that there maybe exist a more general form of the hod s conjecture .",
    "it should be pointed out that although the formula ( [ 12 ] ) is not related to the dilaton field parameter @xmath12 obviously , it does not means that the quasinormal modes are independent of the dilaton .",
    "the reason is that we just consider the contribution of the leading term @xmath96 in the potential @xmath97 to the local monodromy of the wave function @xmath86 .",
    "if we consider the contribution of the lower order terms in the potential @xmath98 , the corrected term to the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies will depend on the parameter @xmath12 of the dilaton field . for example , as @xmath12 is very small , the main corrected term is roughly in proportion to @xmath99 $ ] , which shows that the quasinormal frequencies increase as @xmath12 increases in the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton spacetime .",
