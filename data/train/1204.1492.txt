    "entanglement is the important quantum resource in both quantum communication and computation @xcite .",
    "the applications of entanglement information processings such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum secret sharing @xcite and quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) @xcite all resort the entanglement for setting up the quantum channel between long distance locations .",
    "unfortunately , during the practical transmission , an entangled quantum system can not avoid the channel noise that comes from the environment , which will degrade the entanglement .",
    "it will make a maximally entangled state system become a mixed one or a partially entangled one .",
    "therefore , these nonmaximally entangled systems will decrease the security of a qkd protocol if it is used to set up the quantum channel .",
    "moreover , they also will decrease the fidelity of quantum dense coding and quantum teleportation .",
    "entanglement purification is a powerful tool for parties to improve the fidelity of the entangled state from a mixed entangled ensembles @xcite . on the other hand , the entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp )",
    "is focused on the pure less - entangled system , which can be used to recover a pure less - entangled state into a pure maximally entangled state with only local operation and classical communications @xcite .",
    "most of the ecps such as the schmidt decomposition protocol proposed by bennett _",
    "@xcite , the ecps based on entanglement swapping @xcite , linear optics @xcite , and cross - kerr nonlinearity @xcite are all focused on the bell states and multi - partite greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states . because all the ecps for bell stats can be easily extended to the ghz states .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath1 state , which has the different entanglement structure and can not be convert to the ghz state directly with only local operation and classical communication , has began to receive attention both in theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "agrawal and pati presented a perfect teleportation and superdense coding with @xmath1 states in 2006 @xcite . in 2010 , tamaryan _ et al .",
    "_ discussed the universal behavior of the geometric entanglement measure of many - qubit @xmath1 states @xcite .",

    "cao and yang has discussed the @xmath1 state concentration with the help of joint unitary transformation@xcite . in 2007 ,",
    "a @xmath1 state ecp based on the bell - state measurement has been proposed @xcite . then in 2010 , wang _ et al .",

    "we also have proposed an ecp with both linear optics and cross - kerr for three - particle @xmath1 state @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these ecps described above all focus on the three - particle @xmath1 state and they are mostly to concentrate some @xmath1 states with the special structures .    in this paper",
    ", we will present an ecp for arbitrary multi - partite polarized @xmath1 entangled systems .",
    "we will describe this protocol in two different ways .",
    "first , we use the partial parity check ( ppc ) gate constructed by linear optics to perform this protocol .",
    "second , we introduce the complete parity check ( cpc ) gate to achieve this task . compared with other conventional ecps , we only resort the single photon as an auxiliary which largely reduce the consumed quantum resources . moreover , with the help of cpc gate , this protocol can be repeated and get a higher success probability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we first briefly explain our ppc gate and cpc gate . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe our ecp with both ppc and cpc gates respectively . in sec .",
    "iv , we make a discussion and summary .",
    "before we start to explain this protocol , we first briefly describe the parity check gate .",
    "parity check gate is the basic element in quantum communication and computation .",
    "it can be used to construct the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate @xcite .",
    "it also can be used to perform the entanglement purification @xcite and concentration protocol @xcite .",
    "there are two different kinds of parity check gates .",
    "one is the partial parity check ( ppc ) gate and the other is the complete parity check ( cpc ) gate . in optical system , a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) is essentially a good candidate for ppc gate as shown in fig.1 .",
    "suppose that two polarized photons of the form @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the horizonal and the vertical polarization of the photons , respectively .",
    "polarization photon and to reflect a @xmath5 polarization photon .",
    ", width=226 ]    let @xmath6 be in the spatial mode @xmath7 and @xmath8 be in the spatial mode @xmath9 .",
    "the whole system can be described as @xmath10 then after passing through the pbs , it evolves as @xmath11 from above description , items @xmath12 and @xmath13 , say the even parity states will lead the output modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 both exactly contain only one photon . but",
    "items @xmath16 and @xmath17 will lead the two photons be in the same output mode , which can not be distinguished . based on the post selection principle , only the even parity state is the successful case .",
    "therefore , the total success probability is @xmath18 .",
    "this is the reason that we call it ppc gate .",
    "another parity check gate say cpc gate is shown in fig .",
    "we adopt the cross - kerr nonlinearity to construct the cpc gate .",
    "cross - kerr nonlinearity has been widely used in quantum information processing .",
    "in general , the hamiltonian of the cross - kerr nonlinearity is described as @xmath19 , where the @xmath20 is the coupling strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "it is decided by the material of cross - kerr .",
    "the @xmath21 are the number operator for mode @xmath22@xcite .",
    "now we reconsider the two photon system @xmath23 coupled with the coherent state @xmath24 . from fig .",
    "2 , the whole system evolves as @xmath25        it is obvious to see that the even parity states make the coherent state @xmath24 pick up no phase shift , but the odd parity state @xmath26 makes the coherent state pick up the phase shift @xmath27 .",
    "the other odd parity state @xmath28 make the coherent state pick up the phase shift with @xmath29 . with a general homodyne - heterodyne measurement",
    ", the phase shift @xmath29 and @xmath27 can not be distinguished@xcite",
    ". then one can distinguish the different parity state according to their different phase shifts .",
    "so the success probability of the initial states collapsing to the even and odd parity state is @xmath30 , in principle .",
    "so we call it cpc gate .",
    "compared with the ppc gate , the success probability for cpc gate can reach the max value 1 but the ppc gate can not reach 1 .",
    "another advantage of the cpc gate is that we get the both even and odd parity state by measuring the phase shift of the coherent state .",
    "that is to say , we do not need to measure the two photons directly .",
    "so after the measurement , the two photons can be remained .",
    "it is so called quantum nondemolition(qnd ) measurement .",
    "but in ppc gate , we should use the post selection principle to detect the two photons being in the different spatial modes by coincidence counting .",
    "after both detectors register the photons with a success case , the photons are destroyed and can not be used further more .",
    "in this section , we start to describe our @xmath0-particle ecp with ppc gate .",
    "an @xmath0-particle @xmath1 state can be described as @xmath31 where @xmath32 . in order to explain this ecp clearly simply , we let @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 be real . certainly , this ecp is also suitable for the case of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 being complex .",
    "@xmath36 means that the @xmath37 photons say @xmath38 are all in the @xmath4 polarization .        from fig .",
    "3 , the @xmath0-photon less - entangled @xmath1 state of the form eq.([partial w state ] ) is distributed to @xmath0 parties , saies bob1 , bob2 , @xmath35 , bob@xmath0 .",
    "bob1 receives the photon of number @xmath39 in the spatial mode @xmath7 .",
    "bob2 receives the number @xmath40 in the spatial mode @xmath9 , and bob@xmath0 receives the photon number @xmath0 in the spatial mode @xmath41 .",
    "that is to say , each of the parties owns one photon .",
    "the principle of our ecp with ppc gate is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the basic idea of realizing the concentration is to use the local operation and classical communication to make each coefficients on each items of eq . ( [ partial w state ] ) all equal to @xmath34 .",
    "if all coefficients are equal , they can be regarded as a common factor and can be neglected .",
    "the remained state is essentially the maximally entangled @xmath1 state .",
    "thus , the whole process can be briefly described as follows : we first divide the whole procedure into @xmath42 steps . in each step , each party say bob@xmath43 should first prepare a single photon . in fig .",
    "3 , the single - photon sources @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath35 , @xmath46 , @xmath35 , @xmath47 are used to prepare the single photons locally .",
    "then he performs a parity check measurement for his two photons .",
    "the one comes from the single photon he prepared , and the other is the photon from the less - entangled @xmath1 state . if the parity check measurement is successful , then he asks the other to perform the further operation .",
    "bob1 first perform the parity check on the photon of number 1 and the prepared single photon .",
    "the single - photon resource @xmath44 for bob1 prepares a single photon in the spatial mode @xmath14 of the form @xmath48 then the initial less - entangled @xmath1 state @xmath49 combined with @xmath50 can be described as @xmath51 after passing through the ppc gate in bob1 s location , bob1 only picks up the even parity state in the spatial mode @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the above state collapses to @xmath54 it can be rewritten as @xmath55 finally , bob1 measures the photon in the spatial mode @xmath53 ( the first photon in eq .",
    "( [ rewrittecollapse11 ] ) ) in the basis @xmath56 , with @xmath57",
    ". then they will get @xmath58 the superscription 1 means that they perform the concentration on the first particle . if the measurement result is @xmath59 , they will get @xmath60 .",
    "if the result is @xmath61 , they will get @xmath62 . in order to get @xmath60 , one of the parties , bob@xmath39 , bob@xmath40 , @xmath35 should perform a local operation of phase rotation on his photon .",
    "the total success probability is @xmath63 compared with eq.([partial w state ] ) , the coefficient of @xmath33 has disappeared in the state of eq.([w11 ] ) .",
    "the next step is to prepare another single photon in single - photon source @xmath45 in the spatial mode @xmath64 of the form @xmath65    following the same principle described above , bob3 lets the photon of number 3 in @xmath60 in the spatial mode @xmath66 combined with the single photon @xmath67 in the spatial mode @xmath64 pass through his ppc gate .",
    "then the whole system evolves to    @xmath68    if he picks up the even parity state , then bob3 measures the photon in the spatial mode @xmath69 in the basis @xmath56 .",
    "they will get @xmath70 the total success probability is @xmath71 @xmath72 essentially contains two parts .",
    "the first one is the success probability to get @xmath73 , and the second one is the success probability for bob3 to pick up the even parity state .",
    "interestingly , from eq .",
    "( [ w21 ] ) , the coefficient @xmath74 has also disappeared .",
    "the following concentration steps are similar to the above description . that is each one performs a parity check measurement and picks up the even parity state .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath75 step , bob@xmath43 first prepares a single photon of the form @xmath76 after he performing the parity check measurement and picks up the even parity state , the original less - entangled @xmath1 state becomes @xmath77 the success probability can be written as @xmath78 if @xmath79 , then they will get the maximally entangled @xmath1 state , with the probability of @xmath80    therefore , the total success probability to get the maximally entangled @xmath1 state from eq .",
    "( [ partial w state ] ) is @xmath81 interestingly , if @xmath82 , it is the concentration of two - particle bell state with @xmath83 .",
    "it is equal to the success probability in refs.@xcite .    by far",
    ", we have fully explained our ecp with ppc gate . during the whole process , we require @xmath42 single photons to achieve this task with the success probability of @xmath84 . except bob2 , each parties needs to perform a parity check . if the parity check measurement result is even , it is successful and he asks others to retain their photons . from sec .",
    "ii , the ppc gate essentially is based on linear optics and we should resort the post selection principle . that is to say , the detection will destroy their photons .",
    "this disadvantage will greatly limits its practical application , because it has to require all of the parties to perform the parity check simultaneously . on the other hand ,",
    "the total success probability is extremely low . because they should ensure all @xmath42 parity checks be successful .",
    "if any of parity check in bob@xmath43 is fail , then the whole ecp is fail .",
    "it is quite different from the ecp of @xmath0-particle ghz state@xcite , due to the same entanglement structure with bell state .",
    "the ecp of bell state is suitable to the @xmath0-particle ghz state with the same success probability @xmath85 with linear optics@xcite .",
    "that is to say , the success probability does not change with the particle number @xmath0 .",
    "however , in this ecp , we find that the @xmath84 changes when @xmath0 changes .      from above description ,",
    "we show that the ppc gate can be used to achieve this concentration task .",
    "however , it is not an economical one and the success probability is extremely low .",
    "the reason is that we only pick up the even parity state and discard the odd one . in this section",
    ", we will adopt the ppc gate to redescribe this ecp .",
    "the basic principle of our ecp is shown in fig .",
    "we use the cpc gates to substitute the ppc gates .        in the first step , the initial state @xmath49 and @xmath50 combined with the coherent state @xmath24 evolve as @xmath86    obviously",
    ", if the coherent state @xmath24 picks up no phase shift , the original state will collapse to the even state similar to @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ collapse11 ] ) .",
    "it can also be rewritten as @xmath88 with the probability of @xmath89 . in this way",
    ", they can also obtain the same state @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ w11 ] ) and can be used to start the next concentration step on the number 3 photon performed by bob3 . on the other hand",
    ", there is the probability of @xmath90 that the original state will collapse to the odd state , if the phase shift of coherent state is @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , it can be written as    @xmath91    after measuring the photon in @xmath53 mode in the basis @xmath56 , above state becomes @xmath92 if the measurement result is @xmath59 , they will get @xmath93 , otherwise , they will get @xmath94 . above equation can be rewritten as @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
    "interestingly , the state of eq .",
    "( [ lessentangled11 ] ) essentially is a lesser - entangled @xmath1 state .",
    "it can be reconcentrated with another single photon on the number 1 photon .",

    "the state @xmath99 and @xmath98 combined with the coherent state @xmath24 evolves as @xmath100    .",

    "different from the scheme described with ppc gate , it can be repeated to get a high success probability .",
    "following the same principle , they can also use this way to concentrating each photons .",

    "( [ pmn ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ probabilityppc ] ) , if @xmath138 are given , the numerator is a constant . but the value of denominator is decided by @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , choosing the smallest value of @xmath34 will get the highest success probability .",
    "this result provide us an useful way to performing this ecp .",
    "if @xmath34 is not the smallest one , then we can rotate the polarization of each photon with half - wave plate until to obtain the smallest @xmath34 .",
    "certainly , we should point out that the ecp with ppc gate and with cpc gate are quite different form each other in the practical manipulation . because the ppc gate is equipped with the linear optical elements and we should resort the pose selection principle to achieve this task .",
    "that is , after successfully performed this ecp , the maximally entangled @xmath1 state is destroyed by the sophisticated single photon detectors .",
    "this condition greatly limit its practical application .",
    "in addition , in sec . iii a , we explain it by dividing the whole ecp into @xmath42 steps . in each step ,",
    "one of the parties prepares one single photon and makes a parity check measurement .",
    "practically , each parties except bob2 should perform the parity check measurement simultaneously due to the post selection principle .",
    "if all parity check measurements are even parities , then by classical communication , they ask each to retain their photons , and it is a successful case . on the other hand , if we adopt cpc gate to perform this ecp , each parties can operate his photons independently . that is , each one can repeat to perform concentration until it is successful .",
    "the most fundamental reason is that qnd is only to check the phase shift of the coherent state and it does not destroy the photon after measurement . in our ecp , after performing the parity check measurement using cpc gate , the next operation is decided by the measurement result .",
    "if it is even parity , it is successful , otherwise , each one can restart to concentrate his photon with another single photon .",
    "this strategy makes the total concentration efficiency be greatly improved .",
    "finally , let us discuss the key element of our ecp , that is the cross - kerr nonlinearity . in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , they also adopt the cross - kerr nonlinearity to construct the parity check gate to achieve the concentration tasks .",
    "unfortunately , in order to increase the efficiency of the protocol , they should resort the coherent state to obtain @xmath139 phase shift .",
    "although there are several strategies to increase the phase shift , such as increasing the strength of the coherent state , controlling the coupling time of the coherent state and the kerr media , and choosing the suitable kerr media , to get giant phase shift is still difficult in current technology @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , cross - kerr nonlinearity is also a controversial topic .",
    "the focus of the argument is still that one can not get giant phase shift on the single - photon level .",
    "this conclusion is agree with the results of shapiro , razavi , and gea - banacloche@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , hofmann pointed out that with a single two - level atom in a one - sided cavity , a large phase - shift of @xmath139 can be achieved@xcite .",
    "current research showed that it is possible to amplify a cross - kerr - phase - shift to an observable value by using weak measurements , which is much larger than the intrinsic magnitude of the single - photon - level nonlinearity@xcite .",
    "zhu and huang also discussed the possibility of obtain the giant cross - kerr nonlinearities using a double - quantum - well structure with a four - lever , double - type configuration@xcite .",

    "third , it does not require the @xmath139 phase shift which is more suitable in current experimental conditions",
    ".    in summary , we have present an universal way to concentrate an n - particle less - entangled @xmath1 state into a maximally entangled @xmath1 state with both ppc gate and cpc gate . in the former , we require the linear optical elements and post selection principle . in the later , we use cross - kerr nonlinearity to construct the qnd . different from other concentration protocols ,",
    "we only need single photon as an auxiliary to achieve the task .",

    "<S> we present an universal way to concentrate an arbitrary @xmath0-particle less - entangled @xmath1 state into a maximally entangled @xmath1 state with different parity check gates . </S>",
    "<S> it comprises two protocols . </S>",
    "<S> the first protocol is based on the linear optical elements say the partial parity check gate and the second one uses the quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) to construct the complete parity check gate . </S>",
    "<S> both of which can achieve the concentration task . </S>",
    "<S> these protocols have several advantages . </S>",
    "<S> first , it can obtain a maximally entangled w state only with the help of some single photons , which greatly reduces the number of entanglement resources . </S>",
    "<S> second , in the first protocol , only linear optical elements are required which is feasible with current techniques . </S>",
    "<S> third , in the second protocol , it can be repeated to perform the concentration step and get a higher success probability . </S>",
    "<S> all these advantages make it be useful in current quantum communication and computation applications . </S>"
