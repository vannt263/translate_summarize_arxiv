    "two main explanations have been suggested to link the average iron excess found in planet host stars ( santos et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) to the presence of planets : the self - enrichement scenario ( gonzalez 1997 ) and the primordial hypothesis ( santos , israelian & mayor 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "if the star underwent significant pollution , refractory elements might be added preferentially compared to volatiles , due to the high temperature environment , and thus abundance patterns depending on the elemental condensation temperature t@xmath0 should be observed .",
    "smith , cunha , & lazzaro ( 2001 ) found a subset of 5 planet - host stars which exhibited an accentuated trend of increasing [ x / h ] with t@xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , their analysis used an inhomogeneous set of abundances from different authors .",
    "subsequent studies by takeda et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and sadakane et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtained no peculiar trends of [ x / h ] with t@xmath0 in a sample of 14 and 12 stars with planets , respectively .",
    "we derived abundance ratios in an almost complete set of 105 planet - host stars and in a volume - limited comparison sample of 88 stars , for the volatile elements cno , s and zn ( see ecuvillon et al .",
    "2004a , 2004b , 2005 ) and for the refractories : cu , si , ca , sc , ti , v , cr , mn , co , ni , na , mg , al ( see ecuvillon et al .",
    "2004b ; beirao et al .",
    "2005 ; gilli et al .",
    "2005 ) . for each target",
    "the [ x / h ] vs.  t@xmath0 trend and the corresponding linear least - square fit were obtained ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we excluded from our analysis targets with less than 14 abundance determinations and less than 2 volatiles , in order to span a large range of t@xmath0 in each case . in fig.2 (",
    "left panel ) , a subsample of 18 stars , 16 and 2 with and without planets , respectively , shows slopes larger than the average plus sigma .",
    "our results do not reveal any striking difference in the [ x / h ] vs.t@xmath0 trends between stars with and without planets .",
    "a subsample of 16 stars with and 2 without planets , with slopes larger than the average value plus sigma , might bear the signature of having undergone some pollution event ( see fig.2 , left panel ) .",
    "in fact , the accretion of planetesimal material in a high temperature environment might produce larger [ x / h ] vs.t@xmath0 slopes .",
    "all the stars display an increasing trend of the t@xmath0 slopes with increasing [ fe / h ] ( see fig.2 , right panel ) , due to the galactic chemical evolution",
    ". however , planet - host stars with [ fe / h]@xmath10.1 present a steeper linear trend with respect to the comparison sample .",
    "this would suggest that pollution events are much likelier to occur at super - solar [ fe / h ] .",
    "unfortunately , t@xmath0 slopes for comparison sample stars with [ fe / h]@xmath10.2 are not sufficiently reliable to be included in our plots .",
    "we can not thus discuss whether this characteristic is proper to planet - host targets . more work is required to obtain more conclusive evidences on the possible cases of pollution .",
