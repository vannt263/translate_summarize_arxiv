    "there has been increasing interest in recent years in the role that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) play in galaxy formation , primarily because of the discovery that most , if not all , present - day massive galaxies harbor a smbh in their nuclei ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; richstone et al .",
    "1998 ) , and that the mass of the nuclear smbh is related to the bulge mass / luminosity ( e.g. , magorrian et al .  1998 ) and even more tightly to the bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; tremaine et al .",
    "these tight correlations imply that the formation of galaxies and the growth of the central smbhs are ultimately connected ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins et al .  2006 ) .",
    "on the other hand , it has long been suggested that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or quasars are smbhs in the process of accretion and growth ( e.g. , salpeter 1964 ; zeldovich & novikov 1964 ; lynden - bell 1969 ) .",
    "indeed , the integrated luminosity density of optically - selected agns , which represents the accretion history of black holes , is consistent with the mass density in the local dormant smbh population ( the sotan [ 1982 ] argument ; e.g. , salucci et al .  1999 ;",
    "yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "this is particularly encouraging , since with ever larger agn / quasar samples in modern surveys , we can hope to understand the cosmic evolution of smbhs within the framework of hierarchical structure formation , and shed light on the coevolution of smbhs and their host galaxies .",
    "a central issue in this regard is to measure the masses of both inactive smbhs and active agns / quasars .",
    "perhaps the most reliable way to measure the black hole mass is via stellar / gas dynamics in the vicinity of the smbh where its gravity dominates the dynamics ( e.g. , richstone et al.1998 ) , but the relevant scales can be resolved only for the nearest galaxies .",
    "a more indirect mass indicator uses the observed tight correlations between the smbh mass @xmath14 and the stellar bulge velocity dispersion @xmath15 ( the @xmath16 relation ) , or the bulge luminosity ( the @xmath17 relation ) .",
    "accurate measurements of the bulge velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity are difficult in luminous quasars , where the agn light overwhelms that of the host galaxy ; these relations are mostly applied to measure the local dormant smbh mass function .",
    "more seriously , the @xmath16 and @xmath17 relations have not been measured directly at the most massive end , and the high - mass end of the bh mass functions estimated using the @xmath16 and @xmath17 relations differ by as much as one order of magnitude ( tundo et al .  2007 ;",
    "lauer et al .",
    "thus there are still unsettled issues on the usage of these techniques .",
    "a third method , reliant on agn physics rather than galaxy properties , is reverberation mapping , which uses the temporal offset between continuum and emission line variability to determine the distance @xmath18 from the central engine to the broad emission line region ( blr ; e.g. , blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) . using the observed line width @xmath19 and assuming that the blr is virialized",
    "allows determination of the black hole mass : @xmath20 . in a handful of cases , measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath18 for several lines in the same object have shown @xmath21 , consistent with the virial hypothesis ( e.g. , peterson & wandel 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , for the few cases in which we have more than one mass indicator , the reverberation mapping mass is also consistent with the dynamical mass or that derived from the @xmath22 relation ( e.g. , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000b ; ferrarese et al .  2001 ;",
    "nelson et al .",
    "2004 ; onken et al .  2004 , 2007 ; greene & ho 2006 ; davies et al .",
    "the reverberation mapping method is very time consuming , and we have reliable masses with this method for only about three dozen agns .",
    "however , reverberation mapping data has revealed a correlation between blr size @xmath18 and luminosity ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , 2005 ) , which allows us to estimate bh masses based on single - epoch spectra . using this @xmath23 correlation and reverberation mapping masses , various empirical scaling relations ( which we term virial bh mass estimators from now on )",
    "have been derived using h@xmath2(kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; vestergaard 2002 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) , h@xmath24  ( greene & ho 2005 ) , mgii  ( mclure & jarvis 2002 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 ) , and civ(e.g . , vestergaard 2002 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) .",
    "this is the only practical method for measuring black hole masses for large numbers of objects at high redshifts and luminosities ( where variability timescales are too long to measure easily ; see the discussion in kaspi et al .  2007 ) , but the @xmath23 relation has only been established in the luminosity range @xmath25 and for redshifts @xmath26 .",
    "the virial bh mass estimators are usually expressed as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , the surrogate for the blr size @xmath18 , is the continuum luminosity near the emission line ( 5100  for h@xmath2 , 3000  for mgii  and 1350  for civ ) , and fwhm is the full - width - at - half - maximum of the line .",
    "some authors prefer to use other quantities in their virial estimates .",
    "for example , wu et al .  ( 2004 ) suggest using recombination line luminosities instead of continuum luminosities because the latter might be contaminated by jet emission or host galaxy starlight ( also see greene & ho 2005 ) .",
    "peterson et al .  ( 2004 ) and collin et al.(2006 ) argue that the second moment of the line profile @xmath29 is a better quantity to characterize the emission - line widths than the fwhm .",
    "as we will show below , different measurement techniques yield systematic differences in derived quantities , and so it is important to use the original definitions of line widths and luminosities for whichever calibration is used .",
    "the uv civ  virial mass estimator can be used for @xmath30 quasars , as the civ  line is the only relevant line available in optical spectra in this redshift range .",
    "however , it has been suggested by a few authors that the civ  line might be a less secure mass estimator than mgii  or h@xmath2 .",
    "the civ  line tends to be asymmetric and blueshifted with respect to lower - ionization lines such as h@xmath2  or mgii  ( e.g. , gaskell 1982 ; tytler & fan 1992 ) , and the most blueshifted objects tend to have the largest fwhms ( richards et al .",
    "these features suggest that civmight be more severely affected than the other lines by a non - virialized gas component , and the measured line width could depend on the viewing angle , biasing the bh mass estimates .",
    "indeed , using a sample of @xmath31 @xmath32 palomar - green ( green , schmidt , & liebert 1986 ) quasars , baskin & laor ( 2005 ) showed that the civ  fwhm is poorly correlated with the h@xmath2fwhm ( e.g. , see their figure 3 ) , suggesting that the two lines have different origins . on the other hand , the mgii  fwhm is well - correlated with that of h@xmath2 , and these two low - ionization line estimators usually give consistent virial masses ( e.g. , mclure & dunlop 2004 ; salviander et al .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to explore how the civ  estimator might be biased relative to low - ionization line estimators such as mgii  using a large sample of quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) .    despite the caveats in these virial estimators , virial bh masses have been measured for various agn / quasar samples covering a wide range of redshifts and luminosities .",
    "for example , mclure & dunlop ( 2004 ) measured virial bh masses for @xmath33 quasars with @xmath34 from the sdss dr1 quasar catalog ( schneider et al .  2003 ) using h@xmath2  and mgii .",
    "vestergaard ( 2004 ) used h@xmath2  and civto measure virial bh masses for a hybrid sample including 87 @xmath35 bright quasar survey ( bqs , schmidt & green 1983 ) quasars , 114 @xmath36 quasars , and @xmath37 @xmath38 sdss quasars .",
    "greene & ho ( 2007 ) present the bh mass function for @xmath39 broad - line agns with @xmath40 from the sdss .",
    "fine et al .  ( 2006 ) used composite spectra to measure the redshift evolution of the mean bh mass for the 2qz quasar sample ( croom et al .",
    "2004 ) from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , and kollmeier et al.(2006 ) presented virial bh masses for a sample of 407 agn with @xmath43 selected from the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ; kochanek et al .",
    "2004 ) and focused on the distribution of eddington ratios .",
    "yet by far the largest quasar sample is the recently published sdss dr5 quasar catalog ( schneider et al.2007 ) , containing more than @xmath44 quasars , about half of which are homogeneously selected ( e.g. , richards et al .",
    "2006a ; shen et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this paper",
    "we present virial bh mass estimates for this optical quasar sample and explore possible biases in their estimation .",
    "though the dynamical range in luminosity and color of sdss quasars is limited , the large size of the sample provides unprecedent statistics .",

    "the observed distribution of fwhms has profound effects on our determination of the distribution of virial bh masses , as will be further explored in section [ sec : mc ] .",
    "there are subsamples of quasars for which we have two lines available ; given the sdss spectroscopic coverage , we observe both h@xmath2  and mgii  for @xmath107 , and both mgii  and civ  for @xmath13 . therefore we can check if different bh mass estimators give consistent results .      for a subsample of @xmath108 quasars with redshift @xmath109 we have both h@xmath2  and mgii  linewidth measurements .",

    "while the broad component of mgii  is well - described as a gaussian in our fits , the vast majority of civ  lines are by no means gaussian .",
    "the difference in line shapes suggests that the broad mgii  and civ  might have different physical origins .",
    "second , it is well known that high ionization lines such as civ  often show systematic blueshifts with respect to low ionization lines such as mgii  ( e.g. , gaskell 1982 ; tytler & fan 1992 ; richards et al.2002b ) .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 2002b ) used @xmath120 sdss quasars to show that civ  is systematically blueshifted with respect to mgii  by @xmath121 on average .",
    "they interpreted this apparent blueshift as due to the absorption of the civ  red wing , as might be expected if the broad - line region gas is actually a radiatively driven , equatorial outflow .",
    "such disk - wind models are compelling for a variety of reasons , particularly their success in explaining the properties of broad absorption line quasars ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "1995 ; proga et al .",
    "2000 ; elvis 2000 ) .",
    "richards et al .",
    "also see a trend of increasing average civ  fwhm with increasing civ - mgii  blueshift , which again suggests that the broad civ  line is dominated by a disk wind component ; in this case the civ - mgii  blueshift reflects the orientation of the line - of - sight ( los ) .",
    "there is additional evidence supporting this disk wind / orientation scheme , including the anti - correlation between the civ - mgii  blueshift and radio loudness , and the correlation between the civ - mgii  blueshift and bal fraction ( see also gallagher et al .",
    "these properties are also seen in a sample of low redshift broad line agns ( sulentic et al.2007 ) .",
    "of course , alternative interpretations of these features are possible , which depend more on the structure of the wind than on the los orientation ( see richards 2006 ) .    if the broad civ  is indeed contaminated or even dominated by a disk wind component , then the measured civ  fwhm does not represent the actual virial velocity of the blr .",
    "if the los is along the disk wind , then the fwhm will overestimate the virial velocity , while if the los is along the pole direction , the fwhm will probably underestimate the virial velocity .",
    "although the civ  estimator is calibrated in such a way that it gives , on average , bh masses consistent with those estimated from h@xmath2(e.g . , vestergaard 2002 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) , there will be biases in the civ - based virial masses if the above picture is correct .",
    "we explore these issues by plotting various quantities against the civ - mgii  blueshift in fig .",
    "[ fig : blueshift ] .",
    "the left panel shows the correlation between the civ  fwhm and the civ - mgiiblueshift .",
    "we see the rise of the average civ  fwhm as the blueshift increases , as reported by richards et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "in particular , very few objects with large blueshifts have fwhm less than @xmath122 , while the distribution of fwhm is broader for objects with small blueshifts .",
    "the middle panel shows a mild anti - correlation between the mgii  fwhm and the civ - mgii  blueshift , and the right panel shows a mild correlation between the bolometric luminosity @xmath102 and the blueshift , which has been found before ( e.g. , richards et al.2002b ) .",
    "the cause of the anti - correlation between mgii  fwhm and civ - mgii  blueshift is not clear at this point",
    ". it might reflect inclination effects as well .",
    "the different correlations of the civ  and mgii  line widths with blueshift suggest that the two lines have different origins , as we argued above .    since the civ  estimator",
    "is calibrated using h@xmath2reverberation mapping masses ( e.g. , vestergaard 2002 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) , there should be no mean offset in either the fwhms or the estimated bh masses , as we find ( see the black solid histograms in the bottom panels in figs .",
    "[ fig : civ_mgii_fwhm ] and [ fig : civ_mgii_bh ] ) .",

    "[ fig : civ_mgii_fwhm ] ) ; indeed the width of 0.18 dex is larger than the dispersion in the mgii  fwhm distribution itself . correspondingly , the log of the ratio of mgii  to civ  bh masses follows a gaussian with mean @xmath123 dex and dispersion 0.34 dex .",

    "moreover , this scatter is systematic with blueshift .",
    "the blue points and histogram in figure  [ fig : civ_mgii_fwhm ] refer to objects with blueshift larger than 1000 km s@xmath88 , while the red points have smaller blueshift .",

    "the correlation is much weaker than we found for the mgii - h@xmath2comparison .",
    "the ratio of these two masses is correlated with the civ - mgii  blueshift , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : civ_mgii_bh ] ( top panel ) . given the similarity between the properties of the mgii  and h@xmath2  lines , and the evidence that the civ  line may be affected by a disk wind",
    ", we argue that h@xmath2  and mgii  are better bh mass estimators than is civ .",
    "in particular , we emphasize the danger of using civ  as a bh mass estimator for individual objects and small samples .",
    "for example , kurk et al.(2007 ) and jiang et al .",
    "( 2007a ) have obtained observations of both mgii  and civ  in four @xmath125 quasars . in the three quasars",
    "in which civ - mgii  blueshifts are observed , the civ  virial mass is @xmath126 times larger than the mgii  mass , while they are in good agreement for the one object with a civ - mgii  redshift , consistent with the trends we see in figure  [ fig : civ_mgii_bh ] .",
    "finally we point out that the ratio of mgii  and civ  virial masses does not depend on luminosity in the range where both line estimators are available , excluding luminosity - based biases .    of course we can not measure the blueshift , and thereby correct the civ  mass estimate for the bias of figure  [ fig : civ_mgii_bh ] , of objects for which our spectral coverage only includes civ .",
    "however , richards et al .",
    "( 2002b ) show that the civ - mgiiblueshift correlates broadly with the civ  line asymmetry , suggesting that we might use this asymmetry as a surrogate to estimate the mass estimate bias .",
    "however , the correlation between the civ - mgii  blueshift and the civ  line asymmetry shows a large amount of scatter , making it difficult to correct for this bias using the civ  line asymmetry .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to carry out a thorough investigation of the blr and disk geometry and dynamics needed to understand the physics behind the trends we ve found .",
    "therefore , in the following sections , we simply use the civ  estimator to measure bh masses at @xmath127 . our confidence in the civestimator",
    "is built on the large sample studied here and the belief that there is no systematic offsets _ in the mean _ using the civ  estimator .",
    "we present virial bh masses for the sdss dr5 quasars with @xmath128 .",
    "excluding those objects for which we can not obtain reliable fwhm or continuum luminosity measurements due to poor spectra or redshift limitations , we have 56,872 objects ( nonbals ) with measurable virial bh masses .",
    "the masses are based on the h@xmath2  estimator for @xmath129 , mgii  for @xmath130 , and civ  for @xmath131 , to avoid using measurements which are too close to the red and blue ends of the spectra .",
    "we should note that the quasars in this catalog were not all uniformly targeted ; in particular , special targeting algorithms were used to select quasar candidates to fainter magnitudes than the main quasar survey ( richards et al .",
    "the completeness of these fainter quasars is poor .",
    "we start by neglecting this effect ; we take all the quasars in the dr5 quasar catalog with measurable masses and present the redshift evolution of virial bh masses (  [ sec : bh_z_eov ] ) and eddington ratio distributions (  [ sec : eddington_dist ] ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the complete subsample in  [ sec : mc ] and  [ sec : mc - results ] , where we model the observed black hole mass distribution .",
    "we describe the active bh mass function in  [ sec : mass_fun ] , and discuss radio - loud and bal quasars in  [ sec : bal ] .",
    "[ fig : bh_evo ] shows the dependence of virial bh masses on redshift , where gray dots represent individual objects and the filled circles show the mean value at each redshift . because of the incompleteness of the sample at the faint end , the `` mean '' bh masses here are weighted towards high luminosity objects at all redshifts .",
    "nevertheless , the mean bh mass increases with redshift below @xmath132 , and then flattens out above @xmath132 ; the most massive bhs seem to turn off around this epoch .",
    "there is clear evidence of a limiting bh mass @xmath133 , consistent with the conclusions of mclure & dunlop ( 2004 ) for @xmath134 sdss dr1 quasars .",
    "the trend of this figure is quite similar to fig . 4 of vestergaard ( 2004 ) , except that we have filled the gaps in their figure with our much larger sample .",
    "the relation between virial bh mass and bolometric luminosity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edd_dist ] .",
    "the figure shows objects using the three virial estimators in different colors ( red for h@xmath2 , green for mgii  and blue for civ ) , while the diagonal lines indicate various eddington ratios @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "the vast majority of quasars in our sample are bounded by @xmath137 and @xmath138 , with a geometric mean value of @xmath139 .",
    "we are not surprised to see that objects using these virial relations occupy a stripe in the mass - luminosity plane , with a slope @xmath140 and scatter @xmath141 dex around the mean .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that the fwhm distribution is almost independent on luminosity , and has a very narrow width of @xmath142 dex at fixed luminosity ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fwhm_dist_more ] ) .",
    "this also explains the remarkably similar appearance of the @xmath143 diagram in several other investigations even though the underlying samples are quite different ( e.g. , woo & urry 2002 ; kollmeier et al .",
    "2006 ) , simply because similar virial estimators are used to estimate bh masses , and the fwhm distributions of different samples are similar .",
    "[ fig : edd_hist ] shows the distributions of @xmath144 in five luminosity and four redshift bins .",
    "the distribution of eddington ratios is log - normal in almost all of the bins .",
    "no appreciable redshift evolution is seen for objects with the same luminosity .",
    "the widths of the distributions are as small as @xmath145 dex , similar to those in kollmeier et al.(2006 ) .",
    "since virial mass is approximately proportional to the square root of luminosity , the widths of the observed eddington ratio and the virial bh mass distributions in each luminosity / redshift bin should be comparable , as is seen .",
    "the width of the virial bh mass distributions within each luminosity / redshift bin is thus @xmath145 dex or less .    at face value ,",
    "the very narrow widths of the virial bh mass distribution in each luminosity bin seem somewhat surprising , since many studies have quoted significantly larger scatter between single - epoch virial masses and both reverberation - mapped masses on the one hand and stellar velocity dispersions on the other .",
    "for instance , mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) find an rms scatter of 0.4 dex of virial mgii  masses around reverberation - mapping masses , while vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) find scatters of 0.3 and 0.5 dex of the civ  and h@xmath2  virial masses about the rm masses respectively .",
    "an independent estimate may be derived by comparing virial masses with stellar velocity dispersions ; greene & ho ( 2006 ) find an rms scatter of 0.4 dex of virial h@xmath24masses around the expectation from the @xmath16 relation . in all of these cases , it is important to remember that the objects in question are typically much less luminous ( and at much lower redshift ) than the quasars we study here , but these are the measurements at our disposal at the present time .",
    "however , the observed width of the virial mass distribution within a given luminosity / redshift bin is _ not _ the uncertainty in the virial mass estimators themselves .",
    "although we do not have a deterministic model for the origin of the uncertainty in the virial relations , it must result both from the imperfect relation between luminosity and blr radius on the one hand , and from the imperfect relation between fwhm and blr virial velocity on the other .",
    "thus the uncertainty in the virial mass estimators comes from the uncorrelated rms scatters in both luminosity and fwhm .",
    "when we impose luminosity cuts to our sample , i.e. , either by working within luminosity bins or because of the flux limits of our sample , we will artificially narrow the observed distribution of virial masses .    at the same time , if the underlying bh mass distribution is such that there are more bhs towards lower masses / lower luminosities , then more objects will scatter from low - mass bins to high than the other way around , giving rise to a malmquist - type bias ( e.g. , eddington 1913 ; malmquist 1922 ) in the observed virial black hole mass and eddington ratio . in the next section , we use monte carlo simulations to investigate the impact of luminosity cuts and malmquist bias on our observed distributions of luminosity , line width , virial bh masses , and eddington ratios .",
    "the results are shown in   [ sec : mc - results ] , where we also present an analytic derivation of the malmquist bias .",
    "we ask whether we can reproduce the observed distributions given a set of reasonable assumptions for the true underlying distributions of black hole masses and eddington ratios .",
    "in particular , our model should be able to reproduce the observed distributions of fwhms in each redshift - luminosity bin , and a reasonable amount of uncertainty in virial relations .",
    "also , the model should produce a luminosity distribution consistent with the observed quasar luminosity function . since the bh mass and eddington ratio distributions may evolve with redshift , we consider two redshift ranges : @xmath146 , where the mgiiestimator is used throughout , and @xmath147 , where the civestimator is used .",
    "we only consider the subset of uniformly - selected quasars in this section , and we restrict ourselves to objects with @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively , above which our sample is close to complete in our two redshift ranges ( e.g. , richards et al .",

    "this similarity in virial bh masses for bals and nonbals supports the idea that bals are intrinsically no different from nonbals , and the bal phenomenon is caused by different viewing angles with respect to a disk wind ( e.g. , weymann et al .",

    "this picture is also consistent with our recent findings that bals show similar large - scale clustering to nonbals ( shen et al .",

    "the difference in the mean of the distribution can be due to a variety of effects : different samples , different virial estimators and different calibrations for the same estimator , as well as different procedures to measure luminosities and line widths used in these virial estimators .",
    "we elaborate below how these various choices lead to differences in virial masses even for a given underlying sample .",
    "there are several versions in the literature of a given virial estimator , and they do not generally yield the same virial mass when applied to sdss or other quasar / agn samples .",
    "for example , the h@xmath2  calibrations in mclure & dunlop ( 2004 ) and in vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) differ by @xmath260 dex given the mean luminosity @xmath261 in our sample . likewise",
    ", for the mgii  estimator , the version in mclure & dunlop ( 2004 ) yields a larger virial mass by @xmath145 dex for @xmath262 ( which corresponds to sdss quasars at @xmath132 ) , than the older version in mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) .",
    "the latter case partially explains the discrepancy between our measurements and a subset of our sample measured by ganguly et al .",
    "while we have used the most recent calibrations available ( mclure & dunlop 2004 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) , it is quite likely that those calibrations will change when the updated @xmath23 relation and virial coefficient ( zero - point offset ) are incorporated ( onken et al.2004 ; bentz et al .",
    "2006 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "even for the same calibration , different authors have used a variety of ways to measure luminosity and line width parameters , which will lead to systematically different results .",
    "for example , the mean mgii  fwhm taken from the broad component of a two - gaussian fit is larger by @xmath89 dex than the non - parametric fwhm measured from the modelled spectrum which best reproduces the line profile .",
    "this contributes to the underestimation of the mgii  based virial masses ( e.g. , dietrich & hamann 2004 ; ganguly et al .",
    "2007 ) . for civ ,",
    "on the other hand , it is more reasonable to use the fwhm measured from the modelled flux that best reproduces the civ  line profile because that is how the civ  relation is calibrated ( e.g. , vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) .",
    "although some argue that a narrow - line component is present in the civ  line ( e.g. , marziani et al .",
    "1996 ) and recipes have been provided for subtracting it ( cf . , bachev et al.2004 ) , we can not perform such an exercise until the civestimator is re - calibrated with narrow - line - subtracted line widths .",
    "indeed , it is _ crucial _ to use the methods of measuring fwhms used in the original calibrations of these virial relations if one wants to obtain unbiased results .",
    "we feel confident about our choices , as we found no mean offset between virial masses based on different lines ( figs .",
    "[ fig : hbeta_mgii_hist ] and [ fig : civ_mgii_bh ] ) .",
    "there are some additional factors that might lead to differences between our measurement and others for the same sample of quasars .",
    "first , the spectroscopic flux scale used in this study is higher than previous sdss data releases ( dr5 and prior ) by @xmath63 dex , giving rise to a systematic @xmath263 dex increase in virial masses .",
    "second , we have separated the broad and narrow components of h@xmath2  and mgii  at a fwhm of 1200 km s@xmath88 , following hao et al .",
    "it is possible that we are biasing the mean virial mass by doing so . nevertheless , these effects are minor considering the uncertainties in the zero - point offsets of these virial estimators .",
    "as we discussed in  [ sec : eddington_dist ] , given the independence of the observed fwhm distribution with luminosity , objects in the @xmath264 plane tend to lie on a narrow stripe with a slope @xmath265 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : edd_dist ] ) .",
    "the lower - luminosity high redshift quasars in the kollmeier et al .",
    "( 2006 ) sample would also fall on the stripe .",
    "the mean apparent eddington ratio @xmath266 .",
    "thus the expected @xmath267 would be @xmath268 for @xmath269 , @xmath270 for @xmath271 , and @xmath272 for @xmath273 for @xmath274 .",
    "these eddington ratio values are in good agreement with the typical eddington ratios from x - ray selected agn samples which cover the bolometric luminosity range @xmath275 ( e.g. , panessa et al .  2006 ; babi et al .  2007 ;",
    "ballo et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , there are two reasons to be cautious about this apparent agreement : current x - ray selected agn samples still suffer from limited sample size and various incompletenesses , and most of the bh masses in x - ray selected agn are estimated based on host galaxy properties rather than virial methods , and it remains unclear how good these methods agree with each other for those low - luminosity bhs .",
    "on the other hand , virial methods have their own limitations due to their reliance on poorly understood blr physics .",
    "if the existence of the broad line region itself depends on eddington ratio , then it is not surprising that broad line agn / quasars lie preferentially within a favorable eddington ratio range .",
    "moreover , the width of the eddington ratio distribution at fixed luminosity could be underestimated , if , for example , the line widths only partially reflect the virial velocities in the blr , as we will further discuss in  [ sec : disc3 ] .",
    "although the large size of the sdss sample provides unprecedented statistics , we feel obligated to point out its limitations .",
    "first , the dynamic range in luminosity is narrow for sdss quasars . only luminous quasars are included in the flux - limited sample .",
    "other surveys , such as the ages survey ( kochanek et al .",
    "2004 ) and the 2df - sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) survey ( cannon et al .",
    "2006 ) extend to fainter luminosities at the same redshift .",
    "our sample does include some objects of lower luminosity , but they are incomplete in ways that are hard to quantify .",
    "second , the wavelength range of sdss spectra has forced us to use different virial estimators at different redshift . although we cross - compared virial relations of h@xmath2-mgii  and mgii - civ , the direct comparison between the h@xmath2  and civ  estimators is impossible with sdss spectra .",
    "thus it is important to study these broad lines simultaneously with multi - band spectra ( e.g. , sulentic et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ; baskin & laor 2005 ) .",
    "it is also desirable to obtain near - ir spectra for high - redshift quasars with optical spectra , to get h@xmath2  or mgii  measurements ( e.g. , sulentic et al .",
    "2006 ; jiang et al .  2007a ; kurk et al .  2007 ;",
    "netzer et al .",
    "2007 ) , since the civ  virial estimator alone is perhaps questionable for the reasons we have discussed in this paper .      in  [ sec :",
    "mc ] we introduced a statistical model which can reproduce the observed luminosity and fwhm distributions .",
    "we now provide some justifications of our choices of model parameters , and discuss the connections between the real physical quantities , i.e. , blr size and virial velocity , and their surrogates , luminosity and fwhm .",
    "an important assumption of our model is the origin of the uncertainties in virial estimators , i.e. , for fixed true bh mass , the virial estimator will give an estimate log - normally distributed around the right mean value and with dispersion @xmath224 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath224 remains unclear : the rms scatter of virial masses around reverberation mapping ( rm ) masses ( e.g. , mclure & jarvis 2002 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) is @xmath276 dex , comparable to the rms scatter of virial masses around bh masses derived from the @xmath16 relation ( e.g. , greene & ho 2006 ) ; but the relationship of this number to the scatter around _ fixed true _",
    "bh mass is unknown . given all the issues with virial estimators we discussed in  [ sec : disc1 ] , it seems unlikely that virial estimates based on single - epoch spectra are good to a factor of 2 , an accuracy that can barely be achieved with reverberation mapping .",
    "therefore we believe our choice of @xmath277 dex is appropriate .    at a given true bh mass , in our simplistic model , the broadening of the luminosity distribution is completely uncorrelated with the broadening of the fwhm distribution .",
    "are our required values for the uncorrelated scatters @xmath157 and @xmath161 consistent with observations ?",
    "current reverberation mapping data indicate a scatter of @xmath278 dex in luminosity at fixed blr size ( e.g. , kaspi et al . 2005 ; bentz et al .",
    "the best studied reverberation mapping sources indicate scatters of @xmath279 dex in line width at fixed blr size for a given object ( e.g. , bentz et al .",
    "these values are for a handful of well studied objects with reverberation mapping of the h@xmath2  line only , and we might expect somewhat larger scatters for both luminosity and line width in samples with a wider range of luminosity and redshift than probed by current rm samples .",
    "thus while our choices of uncorrelated scatters @xmath183 dex and @xmath280 dex may appear rather large , they are at least plausible . we still expect some component of the variations in luminosity to correlate directly with variations in fwhm , as is seen in local samples . here",

    "we further compared the mgii  and civ  estimators in a subsample of quasars with both lines .",
    "their fwhm ratio follows a log - normal with mean 0.027 dex and dispersion 0.18 dex ; the ratio of their virial estimates follows a log - normal with mean @xmath123 dex and dispersion 0.34 dex . thus virial bh estimates are consistent using both lines , although with larger scatter than between h@xmath2  and mgii .",
    "however , the dispersion in the fwhm ratios is comparable to or even larger than the dispersion of the mgii  and civ  fwhm distributions themselves , and the mgiifwhm and civ  fwhm are weakly correlated at best ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : civ_mgii_fwhm ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the civ  estimator tends to give smaller virial masses than the mgii  estimator for objects with small blueshifts ( @xmath315 ) , and conversely for objects with larger blueshifts .",
    "the reason for this systematic bias is attributed to the geometry of the blr .",
    "the civ  line shows many features that suggest a component from non - virialized gas such as a disk wind ( murray et al .",
    "1995 ; proga et al .",
    "2000 ; elvis 2000 ) .",
    "therefore the civ  fwhm is perhaps not a good indicator of the blr virial velocity .",
    "the current calibration of the civ  estimator gives consistent results with those using the other two estimators in the mean , but we caution that the bias may be large for individual objects .",
    "the typical range of virial bh masses in the sdss quasar sample is @xmath3 .",
    "the upper envelope of the virial mass distribution rises up to @xmath132 and then flattens out .",
    "there is a clear upper limit @xmath4 for all quasars , as other studies have found ( e.g. , mclure & dunlop 2004 ; vestergaard 2004 ) .",
    "quasars lie in a narrow stripe in the mass and luminosity diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : edd_dist ] ) bounded by @xmath316 and @xmath317 , consistent with recent findings ( e.g. , woo & urry 2002 ; kollmeier et al.2006 ) .",
    "however , this distribution is implicitly constrained by the virial relations and the observed fwhm distributions .",
    "similar to the findings of kollmeier et al .  ( 2006 ) , the distributions of apparent eddington ratios @xmath318 based on virial bh masses in different redshift - luminosity bins follow log - normal distributions , with means between @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "the widths of these distributions are typically @xmath145 dex or less .",
    "the narrowness in the observed eddington ratio ( and virial mass ) distributions within each luminosity bin is interpreted as arising from the combination of luminosity cuts and the underlying distributions of fwhms ; it is not the same as the intrinsic uncertainty in the virial mass estimators . by assuming an underlying true bh mass distribution and an eddington ratio distribution at fixed true bh mass , together with the assumptions that the observed luminosity and fwhm are imperfect tracers of the virial bh mass",
    ", we were able to reproduce the observed distributions of luminosities , fwhms , virial bh masses and apparent eddington ratios in each luminosity bin .",
    "monte carlo simulations demonstrate that the observed virial bh mass and apparent eddington ratio distributions are subject to malmquist bias , i.e. , more lower - mass bhs are scattered upwards due to the scatter between virial mass and true bh mass than higher - mass bhs are scattered down . to better quantify this malmquist bias",
    "we need a better understanding of the form and scatter in the virial relations .",
    "we also compared the distributions of virial bh masses for radio - loud quasars and bals with that of `` ordinary '' quasars matched in redshift and luminosity .",
    "the mean virial mass of radio quasars is @xmath12 dex larger than that of ordinary quasars , but the mass distribution of bals is indistinguishable from that of ordinary quasars .    with ever larger quasar samples ,",
    "it has now become feasible to measure the clustering properties of quasars , and to directly test galaxy formation scenarios within the hierarchal structure formation framework ( e.g. , shen et al .",
    "2007 and reference therein ) .",
    "the clustering measured in current quasar samples shows only a weak luminosity dependence at @xmath321 ( e.g. , da ngela et al .",
    "2007 ) . since bh mass is tightly correlated with bulge properties ( e.g. ,  tremaine et al .  2002 ) , we expect a correlation between bh mass and host dark matter halo mass ( e.g. ,  ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "the fact that luminosity does not strongly correlate with clustering strength seems to indicate that the instantaneous quasar luminosity is not a good indicator of bh mass ( lidz et al .",
    "in fact , both in our model and in the data itself we see a significant range in luminosities at a fixed bh mass ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : sim1 ] and [ fig : sim2 ] ) .",
    "we plan to study quasar clustering as a function of virial bh mass , taking care to incorporate the effects of the uncertainties in the virial estimators and the malmquist bias .    despite the biases we have identified in this paper , the virial estimators are irreplaceable tools for estimating bh masses in agn / quasars .",
    "one must simply be very careful when interpreting these virial masses for individual objects and for statistical samples .",
    "we point out that our methodology here can be applied to future data sets which push to lower luminosity agn / quasars at all redshifts",
    ". it will be particularly interesting to probe below the break in the quasar luminosity function , where the malmquist bias should be smaller and where it has been suggested that the eddington ratio should be smaller as well ( e.g. , hopkins et al.2006 ) .",
    "this will allow us to explore both the low - mass end of the bh mass function , and to study the nature of objects with low eddington ratio at high redshifts .",
    "in addition , there is a strong need for better understanding of the forms and scatter in the virial relations .",
