    "the gravitational stability of a fluid against convective motion has been extensively studied over the past century .",
    "pioneering examinations of the stability of unmagnetized and magnetized compressible fluids have been conducted by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these papers have had a profound influence on diverse subjects from the dynamics of astrophysical objects to the confinement of plasma in a fusion device . here",
    "we examine the effects of shear in the magnetic field and of an applied shear plasma flow on stability against gravitational interchange .",
    "these effects change the stability properties and our results are important for many applications .",
    "we construct a simple model to study the effects of magnetic shear and shear flow on the stability properties of a magnetized plasma in a gravitational field .",
    "we derive the equations which determine the behavior of this model in the boussinesq limit .",
    "the equations depend on two parameters , the plasma flow alfvn mach number and the entropy gradient .",
    "we conduct a numerical study of the normal modes of instability and summarize the behavior of the unstable modes by a stability diagram .",
    "the stability diagram demonstrates three important characteristics .",
    "first , the entropy gradient must exceed a threshold value for unstable mode growth to occur .",
    "therefore , the shear magnetic field can stabilize a nonzero entropy gradient .",
    "second , as expected , shear flow does act to suppress unstable mode growth when the system is at a substantially unstable point in parameter space .",
    "but , surprisingly , near marginal stability , shear flow actually enhances the growth rates of the instability and also lowers the threshold entropy gradient necessary for instability .",
    "the effect of magnetic shear  to stabilize the plasma and increase the threshold entropy gradient  is diminished by the addition of shear flow .",
    "the system can extract energy from the shear flow to further drive the system to instability .",
    "third , as the alfvn mach number approaches one , the unstable growth rate is suppressed ; the normal modes of the instability are completely stabilized when the plasma flow exceeds the alfvn speed . here , the unstable region in space where a mode can grow moves faster than any perturbation in the system ;",
    "any disturbance will be swept downstream out of the unstable region , leaving behind a stable plasma .",
    "analytical work helps us to understand the mechanisms responsible for these characteristics .",
    "first , the stability criterion for the case without shear flow is derived demonstrating that a shear magnetic field can support a positive entropy gradient .",
    "next , asymptotic solutions demonstrate analytically that stabilization occurs as the alfvn mach number approaches one , yet the threshold entropy gradient for instability goes to zero in the same limit .",
    "in addition , a complete wkb solution in the limit of a large growth rate demonstrates both the stabilization by flow at large growth rates and destabilization near marginal stability .",
    "then , a bounded straight field case is solved exactly to show that the lowering of the threshold entropy gradient with increased shear flow is a characteristic of plasma flow along the field lines and not dependent on the magnetic shear in the general model .",
    "finally , energy conservation relations are derived and analyzed .    in section",
    "[ sec : derive ] , we describe the model under consideration and derive the governing system of equations .",
    "the numerical stability analysis for the general model and the stability diagram are presented in section  [ sec : stab ] .",
    "section  [ sec : anal ] contains the analytical results illuminating the characteristics of the stability diagram .",
    "we describe an exactly soluble , bounded , straight - field case in section  [ sec : str8 ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : disc ] , the implications of this work on galactic physics , accretion disk physics , solar physics , and tokamak confinement are discussed .",
    "in this section , we derive the equations for linear perturbations of a vertically stratified atmosphere with shear magnetic field and shear flow in the high-@xmath0 , or boussinesq , limit . we motivate and apply a coordinate transformation which casts the problem in its most natural form . investigating the limit of the most unstable modes , we derive a system of three coupled first - order ordinary differential equations which capture the lowest order behavior of the model .",
    "consider a stationary state for an ideal plasma with mass density @xmath1 and thermal pressure @xmath2 and an embedded horizontal shear magnetic field given by @xmath3 we then impose a shear flow on this plasma given by @xmath4 and include gravitational acceleration in the vertical direction given by @xmath5 .",
    "equilibrium force balance yields @xmath6 figure  [ fig : geom ] shows the geometry of this shear magnetic field as well as the imposed shear flow on the system .",
    "the instabilities of this plasma are expected to have a short perpendicular wavelength and a long parallel wavelength ( with respect to the magnetic field ) so as to maximize motion in the vertical direction and minimize field line bending @xcite .",
    "short perpendicular wavelengths , however , are rapidly sheared apart by the perpendicular shear flow .",
    "we would thus like to transform to a coordinate system with two properties : first , that the flow is along the magnetic field lines ; and , second , that field lines are coordinate lines .",
    "the application of sheared coordinate systems to simplify a problem of this nature is well documented .",
    "@xcite employed a coordinate system in which the field lines are coincident with the coordinate lines to describe the rayleigh - taylor instability of a fluid supported by a shear magnetic field ; @xcite used a shearing coordinate system to attack the problem of local gravitational instabilities in a system with shear flow arising from differential rotation .",
    "we transform the shear velocity to a parallel velocity by transforming to a frame moving in @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 . in this transformed frame",
    ", the velocity becomes @xmath10 _",
    "i.e. _ parallel to @xmath11 .",
    "we construct field line coordinates by transforming the @xmath12 coordinate to @xmath13 the @xmath14 coordinate is left unchanged , @xmath15 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constant along field lines ( @xmath18 ) and that @xmath19 .",
    "the surfaces of constant @xmath17 twist from vertical at @xmath20 to almost horizontal as @xmath21 . this geometry is shown in figure  [ fig : geom ] .    at first , introducing the field line coordinates seems unhelpful since it introduces explicit @xmath22 dependence into the equations .",
    "the problem also has @xmath14 dependence that arises from the variation of @xmath23 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , one way to tackle this problem is to fourier transform in @xmath12 and @xmath7 and solve for the @xmath14 dependence .",
    "however , the lowest order solution in the twisting coordinate system is a superposition of these fourier modes , or , complementarily , a fourier solution can be constructed by a superposition of these twisting modes @xcite .",
    "we summarize the relationship between these representations in appendix  [ app : reps ] .",
    "we consider the solutions in the twisting coordinates to be more physically relevant since they are localized in @xmath22 .",
    "the basic equations of ideal mhd include the momentum equation written in terms of the gradient of total pressure ( thermal and magnetic ) , the magnetic tension force , and the gravitational force , @xmath24 the induction equation in the limit of zero resistivity , @xmath25 the continuity equation , @xmath26 and the adiabatic equation of state , @xmath27 here @xmath28 denotes the lagrangian derivative , @xmath29 represents the plasma velocity , and @xmath30 is the adiabatic index .",
    "these equations must be evolved subject to the constraint that @xmath31    equations  ( [ eq : mhdmom])-([eq : mhdstate ] ) , linearized about the equilibrium ( equations  ( [ eq : b0])-([eq : equilib ] ) ) , yield : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where we have taken all quantities to vary in time as @xmath36 .    in a straight field @xcite and",
    "a shear field @xcite without flow , the most unstable perturbations are incompressible to lowest order and have a small horizontal perpendicular wavelength .",
    "such perturbations maximize vertical motion which extracts energy from the gravitational potential energy and minimize horizontal motions which extract no energy . to isolate these motions , we impose the ordering    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the ordering parameter or our problem .",
    "clearly , all perturbed quantities vary as @xmath39 .",
    "it is also convenient to define the vectors ,    @xmath40    the perturbed plasma velocity and magnetic field are projected along these directions , _",

    "we expand all perturbed quantities in powers of @xmath47 and denote order as a superscript  for example , @xmath48 .",
    "the ordered , perturbed quantities and operators are substituted into equations  ( [ eq : mhdmomlin])([eq : mhdstatelin ] ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : mhdindlin])([eq : mhdstatelin ] ) at @xmath49 and the @xmath44 projection of equation  ( [ eq : mhdindlin ] ) yield @xmath50 thus , the dominant motion is along the constant @xmath17 surfaces in the @xmath51 direction . equations  ( [ eq : mhdindlin])([eq : mhdstatelin ] ) at @xmath52 produce @xmath53 thus , the perpendicular motion is incompressible to lowest order . at @xmath49 ,",
    "the @xmath44 component of equation  ( [ eq : mhdmomlin ] ) gives @xmath54 equation  ( [ eq : pbal ] ) expresses the fact that , on the time scales of interest , pressure balance is achieved across the convective eddies ( in the @xmath44 direction ) . in a subsidiary expansion , we take the high-@xmath0 , or boussinesq , limit ( @xmath55 ) . thus , equation  ( [ eq : pbal ] ) reduces to @xmath56 , and we find from equation  ( [ eq : mhdstatelin ] ) that @xmath57 at @xmath52 , the @xmath44 component of equation  ( [ eq : mhdmomlin ] ) yields @xmath58 , or taking the high-@xmath0 limit , @xmath59 .",

    "define an eigenvalue problem for @xmath80 .",
    "solution of the stability equations yields @xmath81 .",

    "@xmath66 , the alfvn wave going in the negative @xmath7 ( upstream ) direction , travels at the ( normalized ) speed @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath66 wave is coupled to the @xmath67 wave by magnetic and velocity shear ( the @xmath67 term in equation  [ [ eq : a+b ] ] ) .",
    "the @xmath66 wave is driven by gravity via the @xmath83 term in equation  ( [ eq : a+b ] ) .",
    "@xmath67 , the alfvn wave going in the positive @xmath7 ( downstream ) direction , travels at speed @xmath84 , is coupled to @xmath66 , and is driven by @xmath83 .",
    "the variable @xmath83 is proportional to the density or entropy perturbation and it is driven by both alfvn waves , as seen in equation  ( [ eq : sb ] ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the unstable eigenvalues ( @xmath85 ) and eigenfunctions of equations  ( [ eq : a+b])([eq : sb ] ) .",
    "we have not examined the stable part of the spectrum in detail although numerical results indicate a continuum along the imaginary @xmath80 axis .",
    "two properties of equations  ( [ eq : a+b])([eq : sb ] ) show that it is sufficient to examine stability in the region @xmath86 .",
    "first , note that @xmath87 since we can map equations  ( [ eq : a+b])([eq : sb ] ) onto themselves by the changes @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "second , note that the three asymptotic solutions as @xmath93 are : @xmath94 if @xmath95 , there are no acceptable ( decaying ) asymptotic solutions as @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "thus , @xmath95 has no unstable eigenmodes .",
    "physically , this is because all solutions , even the upstream propagating alfvn wave @xmath66 , are swept downstream .    without flow ,",
    "mhd stability equations are self - adjoint @xcite and @xmath98 is real . with flow ,",
    "no such property is known and @xmath98 can be complex . however , in all our solution methods , @xmath98 has been found to be real for this problem , although we have not been able to prove that this is rigorously true .",
    "the discrete positive real values for @xmath80 correspond to unstable growing modes , and the continuum along the imaginary @xmath80 axis represents traveling alfvn waves .    in the following subsection , we present the numerical solution of equations  ( [ eq : a+b])([eq : sb ] ) .",
    "various analytical limits that illuminate the numerical solutions are treated in subsection  [ sec : anal ] . an exactly soluble model with a straight magnetic field that demonstrates qualitatively similar behavior",
    "is presented in subsection  [ sec : str8 ] .",
    "finally , in subsection  [ sec : energy ] , energy constraints on the instability are discussed .",
    "we looked for normal mode growth in the system defined by equations  ( [ eq : a+b])([eq : sb ] ) using three different numerical methods .",
    "we directly solved for the eigenvalues @xmath80 of this system by matrix solution of the corresponding finite difference equations using the commercial numerical routine package lapack .",
    "we also found the eigenvalues of the equations to high precision using a 1-d shooting code in @xmath7 driven by an adaptive step - size , fourth order runge - kutta method with fifth order correction ( rk45 ) .",
    "finally , for equations  ( [ eq : a+b])([eq : sb ] ) with @xmath80 replaced by @xmath99 , an initial - value code employing barton s method @xcite for second order accuracy in time was written to determine the fastest growing mode for any choice of parameters .",
    "results from all three codes were consistent .    a stability diagram of unstable normal - mode growth rates and stable regions over the parameter space defined by @xmath100 and @xmath101 is presented in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "as we have already noted , no growing mode exists for @xmath95 .",
    "as well , it is obvious that for the non - positive values of the entropy gradient , @xmath102 , there can be no unstable mode growth since the atmosphere is stably or neutrally stratified ; this is demonstrated by the energy arguments presented in section  [ sec : energy ] .",
    "hence , figure  [ fig1 ] need only cover the region of @xmath103 parameter space defined by @xmath104 and @xmath105 to include all possible unstable mode growth .",
    "several features of figure  [ fig1 ] are important to emphasize .",
    "first , for a system without plasma flow ( along the line @xmath106 ) , we see that the entropy gradient must exceed a threshold value , @xmath107 , in order to become unstable when the fluid is supported by a shear magnetic field .",
    "second , the qualitative effect of increasing the plasma flow ( increasing @xmath100 ) on the instability growth rate depends on both the growth rate and the plasma flow . away from marginal stability",
    "( @xmath108 ) , an increase of the plasma flow  equivalent to moving along a horizontal line to the right on the stability diagram  decreases the instability growth rate as one may expect . here , the growing perturbation is sheared out horizontally so that less gravitational potential energy is extracted by motions along the constant @xmath17 surface , reducing the instability growth rate . but near marginal stability ( @xmath109 ) , an increase in the shear flow effects the instability growth rate differently depending on the relative orders of the growth rate , @xmath80 , and of one minus the alfvn mach number , @xmath82 .",
    "the diagonal dotted line in figure  [ fig1 ] denotes @xmath110 . in region ( ii ) of the diagram , @xmath111 and flow suppresses the instability .",
    "but , in region ( i ) , where @xmath112 , an increase in the flow actually enhances the instability growth .",
    "this unexpected result can be explained with some physical insight .",
    "the point where the instability can grow is localized at @xmath20 in our transformed coordinates ; this is where the constant @xmath17 surface is vertical and motions along that surface can extract the most gravitational potential energy with which to drive the instability . when a shear plasma flow is introduced into the system , this is manifested in our transformed system by a plasma flow along the field lines in the @xmath113 direction .",
    "this causes the alfvn modes in the @xmath113 and @xmath114 directions to propagate at different speeds in our transformed system .",
    "the counter - propagating mode ( @xmath66 in our model ) is slowed down , spending more time in the region around @xmath20 where unstable mode growth occurs . hence , the instability is enhanced by a shear flow in the plasma . the final point to be gleaned from figure  [ fig1 ] concerns the behavior as @xmath115 , or as the alfvn mach number approaches one . in this region , every contour corresponding to a finite growth rate asymptotes to @xmath116 ; hence , the instability is stabilized as the alfvn mach number approaches one .",
    "the stability diagram , figure  [ fig1 ] , prominently displays the three main characteristics discussed in section  [ sec : stab ] : a threshold entropy gradient , @xmath107 , necessary for instability in the system without plasma flow ; for increasing plasma flow , a reduction of the unstable growth away from marginal stability , but an enhancement of that unstable mode near marginal stability including a decrease in the threshold entropy gradient necessary for instability ; and the stabilization of unstable normal modes as the alfvn mach number approaches one .",
    "each of these characteristics is relevant in a different region of the @xmath103 parameter space of the diagram . by examining the model in each of these regions of parameter space",
    ", we can confirm and explain our results analytically .",
    "first , we examine the criterion for instability in the absence of plasma flow in section  [ sec : stabcrit ] ; this corresponds to the left vertical axis of the stability diagram where @xmath106 .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : m1lim ] , we conduct an asymptotic analysis in the @xmath115 limit  region ( ii ) of the stability diagram  to show that the plasma is indeed stabilized as the alfvnic mach number approaches one . in section  [ sec : g0 ] , we investigate the reduction of the threshold for instability with plasma flow ; this covers the lower , right - hand side of region ( i ) of the stability diagram . a wkb analysis for a large instability growth rate , presented in section  [ sec : wkb ] ,",
    "yields the behavior of the system in the central and upper portion of the stability diagram ; the suppression of the growth rate by flow in region ( ii ) and its enhancement in region ( i ) are verified by the eigenvalue condition @xmath117 obtained in this analysis .      here",
    "we obtain the stability criterion for a magnetized fluid supported by a shear magnetic field in the boussinesq limit with no shear flow . by using the substitution @xmath118 , the equations without plasma flow ( @xmath106 ) can be simplified to a sturm - liouville equation of the form @xmath119       - \\left [ \\gamma^2 ( 1 + z^2 ) - s'_0 \\right ] v = 0 \\label{eq : vm0}\\ ] ] over the interval @xmath120 .",
    "the boundary conditions on this system necessitate that @xmath121 as @xmath122 . from sturm",
    "s first comparison theorem @xcite , we know that , as the eigenvalue @xmath98 is increased , the solution will oscillate less rapidly with zeros of the function @xmath123 leaving the interval @xmath124 at the boundaries .",
    "thus , if the solution with @xmath125 oscillates , we can increase @xmath98 until the boundary conditions are satisfied , so there will be an unstable solution .",
    "note also that the fastest growing mode has no zeros in the interval and must be even in @xmath7 .",
    "let w(z ) satisfy equation  ( [ eq : vm0 ] ) with @xmath125 . substituting a series solution of the form @xmath126 in equation  ( [ eq : vm0 ] ) ( with @xmath125 )",
    ", we obtain the recurrence relation , @xmath127 with @xmath128    when @xmath129 , solution  ( [ eq : vsoln ] ) oscillates for @xmath130 , and clearly an unstable solution exists .",
    "let us therefore consider stability when @xmath131 .",
    "we take the positive sign in equation  ( [ eq : alpha ] ) ; then @xmath132 is integrable for @xmath130 .",
    "we note that all @xmath133 are positive if @xmath134 is positive .",
    "we choose @xmath135 such that @xmath136 .",
    "the series solution for @xmath137 given by equation  ( [ eq : vsoln ] ) is non - differentiable at @xmath138 ( as we see below ) .",
    "thus , we can not use the solution from equation  ( [ eq : vsoln ] ) over the whole interval and must restrict its use to @xmath139 .",
    "let us suppose ( for contradiction ) that there exists at least one unstable solution of equation  ( [ eq : vm0 ] ) .",
    "further , let @xmath140 be the most unstable solution  as noted above , @xmath140 must be even in @xmath7 and have no zeros in the interval @xmath124 . we therefore choose @xmath141 everywhere .",
    "it is straight forward to show that @xmath142 where the limit @xmath143 is infinitesimally above @xmath138 .",
    "since the integral and @xmath144 in equation  ( [ eq : zero ] ) are positive , we have stability , @xmath145 ( a contradiction ) , if @xmath146 .",
    "since every term in the series equation  ( [ eq : vsoln ] ) is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath7 we expect @xmath147 , but since the limit is nonuniform we take a more careful approach .",
    "we determine the sign of the limit @xmath148 from an examination of the convergence of the series .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath149 as @xmath150 with @xmath151 a positive constant .",
    "thus , the series for @xmath137 ( equation  [ [ eq : vsoln ] ] ) converges for @xmath152 .",
    "however , the series for @xmath153 converges for @xmath139 but not for @xmath138 .",
    "let us write for @xmath154 @xmath155 where @xmath156 is a positive constant and @xmath157 is a large number in the range @xmath158 . using @xmath159",
    ", we obtain @xmath160 thus , the limit of @xmath153 as @xmath161 is @xmath162 , _",
    "i.e. _ negative . from equation  ( [ eq : zero ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath145 and there are no unstable modes for @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the necessary and sufficient condition for instability is @xmath129 .",
    "this criterion can also be written @xmath163 this confirms the result in figure  [ fig1]that a threshold value of the entropy gradient , given by equation  ( [ eq : bouscriterion ] ) , must be exceeded in order to cause instability when the fluid is supported by a shear magnetic field . clearly , without magnetic shear ( @xmath164 ) , the usual criterion , @xmath165 , holds and the motion is the simple interchange of field lines . with magnetic shear , the field lines _ must _ be bent since the interchange of field lines is impossible with finite displacements  thus magnetic shear is stabilizing .",
    "an asymptotic , boundary layer analysis can be carried out in the limit that @xmath166 .",
    "this asymptotic expansion is described in appendix  [ app : mto1 ] .",
    "the eigenvalue condition derived for this limit in that appendix is @xmath167 this relation explains the upturn towards infinity of the constant growth rate contours in region ( ii ) of figure  [ fig1 ] as @xmath115 .      we demonstrate that the threshold entropy gradient for instability ( the limit that @xmath168 ) decreases as the plasma flow velocity is increased and that the threshold value of @xmath101 approaches zero linearly as @xmath166 .",
    "letting @xmath169 , we can redefine the following variables in terms of @xmath170 : @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 . for @xmath166",

    "therefore , the magnetic shear is not responsible for the unexpected decrease in the stability threshold with shear flow ; only a localization of the instability is necessary to demonstrate this characteristic .",
    "a quantitative comparison of figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig : simp ] shows that , to yield equivalent growth rates , a much larger entropy gradient must be supplied in the unbounded case with magnetic shear than in the bounded , straight - field model .",
    "we can understand the difference as follows .",
    "the energy required to bend the magnetic field lines slows the growth of the instability . in the bounded case",
    ", this energy is needed to bend the field line only within the bounded domain .",
    "but , in the unbounded model , the bending of the field lines occurs over a larger extent in @xmath7 , thus requiring more energy and so more effectively suppressing the instability .      in the standard way ,",
    "equations  ( [ eq : a+b])([eq : sb ] ) can be combined , replacing @xmath80 with the time derivative @xmath217 , to obtain an energy integral for the model .",
    "converting back to @xmath186 and @xmath185 using equations  ( [ eq : a+def ] ) and ( [ eq : a - def ] ) , we find @xmath218 dz \\right\\ } = m       \\int^\\infty_{- \\infty } \\frac { s \\delta b_\\perp } { 1 + z^2 } dz .",
    "\\label{eq : bousenergy}\\ ] ] adopting the terminology of @xcite , we define the integral on the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : bousenergy ] ) as the wave energy of the perturbation .",
    "note that , in the absence of flow ( @xmath106 ) , the wave energy is constant in time .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : bousenergy ] ) supplies a limit on the value of @xmath101 necessary for instability : since the @xmath219 and @xmath220 terms are both positive definite , an instability can only develop for @xmath221 . in this case , gravitational potential energy from the @xmath222 term can be harnessed to drive the kinetic energy and field line bending of the instability .    by the same method as above , we find that the wave energy integral for the straight - field model bounded at @xmath223 , in section  [ sec : str8 ] , has the form @xmath224 dz \\right\\ } = \\frac{m}{2 } \\left\\ {   \\delta b_\\perp^2(-l ) - \\delta b_\\perp^2(l ) + \\frac{s^2(l)}{s_0 ' } \\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{eq : straightenergy}\\ ] ] without flow , again , we find that the necessary condition for instability to develop is @xmath221 and that the wave energy integral is constant in time . in the presence of flow ,",
    "we interpret the terms on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : straightenergy ] ) as follows : @xmath225 represents the flow of magnetic energy into the region , @xmath226 represents the flow of magnetic energy out of the region , and @xmath227 represents the flow of gravitational potential energy out of the the region .",
    "to study the effect of magnetic shear and shear flow on local gravitationally induced instabilities , we have constructed a simple model in the boussinesq limit of ideal mhd .",
    "numerical solutions to this model yield a stability diagram of the @xmath103 parameter space .",
    "this stability diagram has three important characteristics .",
    "first , there exists a threshold entropy gradient for unstable mode growth , demonstrating that magnetic shear is a stabilizing influence .",
    "second , flow serves to suppress mode growth in a substantially unstable regime , but near marginal stability it lessens the stabilizing effect of magnetic shear , enhancing unstable mode growth rates and lowering the threshold entropy gradient necessary for instability .",
    "third , normal modes of instability are stabilized completely as the alfvn mach number approaches one because the disturbance is swept downstream out of the unstable region .",
    "analytical work corroborates these characteristics in the different regions of @xmath103 parameter space .    in a shear magnetic field without flow , the characteristic shape of the unstable mode",
    "is such that the field lines remain on the constant @xmath17 surface shown in figure  [ fig : geom ] ; hence , in the lab frame , the field lines must twist as they fall under gravity to remain on this surface .",
    "this occurs because the perturbed field line at any vertical height @xmath14 must align with the direction of the unperturbed field at that height to facilitate interchange .",
    "unlike the ordinary interchange of straight field lines , if magnetic shear is present , the field line _ must _ be bent to allow interchange ; this is the root of the stabilizing influence of the shear magnetic field .",
    "energy extracted from gravitational potential energy as the field line falls must supply both the kinetic energy of the moving plasma , which is frozen to the field line , and the energy required to bend the field line .",
    "unstable motions are localized about the point where the constant @xmath17 surface is vertical ( @xmath138 in figure  [ fig : geom ] ) , because this point is where motions on that surface extract the most gravitational potential energy while minimizing field line bending . when plasma shear flow is included in the problem , this unstable region moves in the lab frame with the flow velocity @xmath228 in the @xmath229 direction .",
    "therefore , this characteristic twisting geometry propagates along @xmath7 at a speed @xmath230 determined by the local flow speed @xmath144 , flow shear length @xmath231 , and magnetic field shear length @xmath232 .",
    "typical eigenfunctions for an entropy gradient of @xmath233 and alfvn mach numbers @xmath106 and @xmath234 are displayed in figure  [ fig : eigfunc ] .    the modifications of the gravitational stability of a magnetized plasma due to the presence of magnetic shear and shear flow impact several diverse subjects .",
    "in solar physics , one of the key processes necessary for the success of the interface dynamo @xcite is the storage of an intense toroidal field in the solar tachocline @xcite until an instability causes an isolated flux tube to rise into the base of the convection zone @xcite .",
    "shear flow is present due to the large differential rotation of the sun in the tachocline region @xcite , and some magnetic shear probably exists here as well ; the impact of shear flow and magnetic shear may alter gravitational stability within this region .",
    "there are two regions in galactic physics where the conditions in our model may apply : near the center of the galaxy , where there likely exists a region of magnetic shear in which the large - scale magnetic field changes from primarily azimuthal to primarily vertical @xcite and shear flow is present through differential rotation , and in the disk of the galaxy , where both magnetic shear and shear flow may be present in the vertical direction away from the mid - plane . in examining the mechanisms for turbulence in accretion disks , @xcite pointed out that a previously discovered @xcite but unappreciated linear mhd instability , driven by differential rotation coupled with magnetic tension , would occur if the accretion disk were threaded by a weak magnetic field .",
    "but the balbus - hawley instability bends the magnetic field lines extensively ; thus , it is stabilized by magnetic tension for large magnetic field strengths @xcite .",
    "although the twisting interchange instability studied here depends not on rotation but on an entropy gradient , it has a characteristic geometry that minimizes field line bending and so may be important in regions of large field strength . as is well known within the fusion community @xcite ,",
    "employing a sheared toroidal magnetic field in a tokamak can help to stabilize , or at least suppress , ballooning instabilities ( buoyant interchange instabilities driven by pressure and curvature forces ) .",
    "the idea of employing shear flow to further stabilize ballooning instabilities has gained much attention in the past decade @xcite .",
    "our work demonstrates that , near marginal stability , shear flow actually lessens the stabilizing effect of magnetic shear , lowering the threshold entropy gradient required for instability and enhancing the unstable mode growth rate .",
    "full stabilization of the plasma will occur only if the alfvn mach number of the plasma flow ( as defined in our transformed coordinates ) exceeds one .",
    "the local nature of the instability examined in this work means that our treatment may apply locally in more complicated environments .",
    "the instability may behave as a traveling `` wave packet '' which moves with the intersection of shear magnetic field lines ( where the constant @xmath17 surface is vertical ) ; the disturbance may move in and out of unstable regions , with the perturbation growing where conditions are unstable and decaying in stable regions .",
    "we have extended the model to include compressibility . in this case , the behavior is governed by a system of five coupled , first - order ordinary differential equations .",
    "five parameters are necessary to describe the system : the alfvn mach number , the plasma @xmath0 , the density gradient , the pressure gradient , and the magnetic field gradient . over some portions of this five - dimensional parameter space",
    ", the growth rate eigenvalue @xmath80 does indeed become complex . producing a simple answer from this more complicated model is quite difficult .",
    "our current research is addressing this difficulty .",
    "but , the magnetic - buoyancy instability @xcite , which depends on compressibility , can not be investigated without employing this more detailed treatment .",
    "we will then be able to relate our work quantitatively to applications such as the stability of magnetic fields in the solar tachocline .",
    "one final possible extension of this research is an investigation of the nonlinear behavior using an initial - value code .",
    "the research was performed under appointment of greg howes to the fusion energy sciences fellowship program administered by the oak ridge institute for science and education under a contract between the u.s .",
    "department of energy and the oak ridge associated universities .",
    "it was supported in part by the national science foundation under grant no .",

    "we are grateful to b. albright , a. cumming , b. dorland , e. quataert , s. tobias , j. toomre , and e. zweibel for useful discussions .",
    "in the sheared magnetic field , the local unstable modes can be written in two ways @xcite ; we call them twisting and fourier modes . for the reader",
    "s convenience , we summarize the essence of the argument here . in the twisted field line",
    "coordinates , we obtain the twisted mode where a perturbed quantity @xmath235 is given by @xmath236 with @xmath237 localized in @xmath7 and varying weakly in @xmath14 compared to @xmath238 .",
    "but since the origin in @xmath7 is arbitrary , we can also write @xmath239 thus , there are an infinite number of twisting modes , each with a different origin of the twist .",
    "we can construct a mode that does not depend on @xmath7a fourier mode  by integrating equation  ( [ eq : t2 ] ) over @xmath199 @xmath240 where @xmath241 thus , the fourier modes and the twisting modes are related by a fourier transform .",
    "clearly , the fourier mode can be made by `` adding '' twisting modes together ( equation  [ [ eq : t3 ] ] ) , or vice versa , using the fourier inversion theorem on equation  ( [ eq : t4 ] ) ; see @xcite for pictures of this superposition .",
    "the fourier modes are narrowly localized in @xmath14typically @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the @xmath14 width of the fourier mode and @xmath244 is the @xmath7 width of the twisting mode .",
    "note this @xmath14 localization of the fourier mode is narrow compared to the @xmath14 variation of the twisting mode . in this paper",
    ", we have taken the twisting mode representation for two reasons : first , the role of the flow , we believe , is more intuitive in this picture ; and , second , the twisting modes are finite in @xmath7 extent and therefore represent more easily the evolution of an initial value problem .",
    "to demonstrate stabilization as the alfvn mach number approaches one , as seen of region ( ii ) of figure  [ fig1 ] , we perform an asymptotic analysis of our model in the limit @xmath115 . for a small dimensionless parameter @xmath170",
    ", we quantify the order of this limit as @xmath245 .",
    "we expect the instability growth rate to be @xmath246 . identifying the terms in the dimensionless system of equations  ( [ eq : a+b])([eq : sb ] ) for reference",

    "asymptotic solutions in the @xmath166 limit can be found in the four regions along @xmath7 displayed in figure  [ fig : asymp ] .",
    "below we find the solutions for each of these regions and , by matching the solutions between these regions , we obtain an eigenvalue condition on the growth rate demonstrating stabilization as the alfvn mach number approaches one .",

    "we treat @xmath255 over these three regions .",
