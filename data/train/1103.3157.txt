    "the onset of the superconducting transition of about 34k is well below the maximal transition temperature for optimally doped smfeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 crystals likely due to severe fluorine loss under film preparation .",
    "also the superconducting transition sufficiently broadens in a magnetic field , what can be due to nonuniform fluorine doping through the film thickness .",

    "however , by approaching this temperature , the shape of the @xmath42 minimum starts to deviate from the theoretically expected behavior already above 20k as shown in fig.[dvdi ] .",
    "this is likely due to inhomogeneities of the superconducting state in the pc region in the case if its size @xmath11 is larger than the coherence length @xmath13 . also with increasing temperature inelastic scattering increases favoring the transition to the thermal regime",
    "this hinders a determination of the gap in this temperature range .",
    "therefore , the determination of the gap of the pc shown in fig.[dvdi ] is restricted to temperatures below 20k .    investigating a dozen of pcs with clear double minima ar structure around @xmath52mv (",

    "the shoulder is washed out in magnetic field 7 t , while the small - gap minima are only slightly suppressed at the same field .",

    "linear extrapolation of @xmath40 to zero result in a critical field of about 30t.,width=302 ]    the above mentioned larger gap structure is also badly resolved in a recent tunneling study of smfeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 compounds @xcite .",
    "the authors concluded that interband quasiparticle scattering has a crucial effect on the shape of the tunneling spectra smearing out in particular a larger gap structure in the electronic dos .",

    "we conclude that the asymmetry of @xmath8 is present independent of the superconducting features .",
    "fig.[as ] shows @xmath8 curves for a few pcs , where clear ar double minima are observed ( fig.[as]a ) or the superconducting structure is superimposed on a broad maximum ( fig.[as]c ) or no superconducting features , but only a sharp zero - bias maximum is present ( fig.[as]e ) . in all cases ,",
    "the antisymmetric part of @xmath8 shows similar behavior and even the same relative value independent of the drastic difference in @xmath8 shape corresponding to different mechanisms of @xmath8 formation .",
    "such robustness of the asymmetry of @xmath8 testifies that this phenomenon is not related to the pc properties , but mainly determined by the properties of the bulk material ( or the film ) .",
    "one common and plausible reason of @xmath8 asymmetry can be the thermoelectric ( seebeck ) effect if the pc is heated up at increasing bias in the thermal regime @xcite .",
    "it is known that @xmath0feaso@xmath1f@xmath2 compounds have a huge seebeck coefficient at low temperatures which reaches -80@xmath66v@xmath67k@xmath68 for @xmath0=sm just above @xmath15 for a sample with @xmath15=53k @xcite and even more ( -140@xmath66v@xmath67k@xmath68 ) for a sample with @xmath15=36k @xcite ( similar as in our film ) .",
    "taking thermoelectric effects in the case of heterocontacts into account , the @xmath8 asymmetry was explained both for heavy - fermion high - resistive compounds @xcite and for diluted kondo - alloys @xcite , where the seebeck coefficient is strongly enhanced .",
    "it seems that an equilibrium heating of the pc is not the only condition for the appearance of thermoelectric effects .",
    "the electron distribution function in ballistic and diffusive pcs is in a highly nonequilibrium state which can be represented by two fermi spheres shifted from each other by applied voltage e@xmath69 @xcite .",
    "this nonequilibrium electronic state produces nonequilibrium phonons with an effective temperature @xmath70ev/4 @xcite which is close to the temperature ev/3.63 @xcite reached in the thermal regime .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the nonequilibrium state in the pc can also cause a thermoelectric voltage in the case of heterocontacts .",
    "this results in a @xmath8 asymmetry similar as observed in pcs in the thermal regime @xcite .",
    "we also would like to draw attention that asymmetry of the stm spectra , see figs.5 , 6 in ref.@xcite , variates and even has different sign for the spectra with similar structure . since stm spectra reflects in a direct way electronic density of states ( dos ) , then the non - reproducible asymmetry of stm spectra point out also to the non - dos nature of the asymmetry , what strengthen our arguments .",
    "as mentioned above , the investigated lafeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 film has a rather poor quality showing a broad superconducting transition already at zero - field which is comparable with that of the smfeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 film at 9 t ( see fig.[rt ] ) .",
    "additionally , a kink appears in @xmath33 ) at temperatures around 18k .",
    "the inset in fig.[la ] shows @xmath42 of lafeaso@xmath1f@xmath2  cu pc with andreev - reflection minima for varying temperature along with gap behavior evaluated by fitting of the @xmath42 curves .",
    "similar as for the smfeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 film only small gap minima are found .",
    "again , the critical temperature obtained by extrapolating the bcs curve to @xmath40=0 is low , i. e. about 18k ( close to the kink in @xmath33 ) , while superconducting features in @xmath42 are seen even at 25k as shown in fig.[la ] .",
    "we attribute this behavior with the variation of the superconducting properties in the pc region due to the short coherence length and the sample inhomogeneity .",

    "we investigated the superconducting energy gap in @xmath0feaso@xmath1f@xmath2 ( @xmath0=la , sm ) films by pcar spectroscopy .",
    "the mean value of the reduced superconducting gap 2@xmath71 is found to be close to the bcs value of 3.5 what is in agreement with pcar data reported in @xcite .",
    "a second larger gap feature is hardly to resolve on pcar spectra",
    ". the reason can be strong interband quasiparticle scattering , which smears out the larger gap structure in the electronic dos both in the tunneling @xcite and in the pcar spectra .",
    "note also that all superconducting features in @xmath42 , including these of non - andreev nature , have disappeared above @xmath7 .",
    "we demonstrate that the asymmetry of @xmath8 curves is independent of the shape of the curves or whether superconducting or ar features are present or not in @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry is not related to the spectroscopy but reflects bulk properties of @xmath0feaso@xmath1f@xmath2 .",
