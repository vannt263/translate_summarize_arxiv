    "this paper deals with the sun - earth system with the modified restricted three body problem model[as in ] including radiation pressure , oblateness of the earth and influence of the belt .",
    "further it considered that the primary bodies are moving in circular orbits about their center of mass .",
    "it is well - known that five equilibrium points(lagrangian points ) that appear in the planar restricted three - body problem are very important for astronautical applications .",
    "the collinear points are unstable and the triangular points are conditionally stable in the classical restricted three body problem[please see @xcite ] .",
    "this can be seen in the sun - jupiter system where several thousand asteroids(collectively referred to as trojan asteroids ) , are in orbits of triangular equilibrium points .",
    "but collinear equilibrium points are also made linearly stable by continuous corrections of their orbits(halo orbits ) .",
    "in other words the collinear equilibrium points are metastable points in the sense that , like a ball sitting on top of a hill . however , in practice these lagrange points have proven to be very useful indeed since a spacecraft can be made to execute a small orbit about one of these lagrange points with a very small expenditure of energy[please see @xcite ] .",
    "we considered the chermnykh s problem which is a new kind of restricted three body problem , it was first time studied by @xcite .",
    "this problem generalizes two classical problems of celestial mechanics : the two fixed center problem and the restricted three body problem .",
    "this gives wide perspectives for applications of the problem in celestial mechanics and astronomy .",
    "the importance of the problem in astronomy has been addressed by @xcite .",
    "some planetary systems are claimed to have discs of dust and they are regarded to be young analogues of the kuiper belt in our solar system .",
    "if these discs are massive enough , they should play important roles in the origin of planetsorbital elements . since the belt of planetesimal often exists within a planetary system and provides the possible mechanism of orbital circularization , it is important to understand the solutions of dynamical systems with the planet - belt interaction.the chermnykh s problem has been studied by many scientists such as @xcite , , and .",
    "the present paper investigates the nature of collinear equilibrium point @xmath0 because of the interested point to locate an artificial satellite .",
    "although there are two new equilibrium points due to mass of the belt(larger than 0.15 ) as obtained by , but they are left to be examined .",
    "all the results are computed numerically using same technique as in @xcite , because pure analytical methods are not suitable . for specific time intervals , and initial values ,",
    "these results provide new information on the behavior of trajectories around the lagrangian point @xmath0 .",
    "it is supposed that the motion of an infinitesimal mass particle is influenced by the gravitational force from primaries and a belt of mass @xmath2 .",
    "the units of the mass and the distance are taken such that sum of the masses and the distance between primaries are unities .",
    "the unit of the time i.e. the time period of @xmath3 about @xmath4 consists of @xmath5 units such that the gaussian constant of gravitational @xmath6 . then perturbed mean motion @xmath7 of the primaries is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are flatness and core parameters respectively which determine the density profile of the belt .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 is the oblateness coefficient of @xmath13 ; @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the equatorial and polar radii of @xmath13 respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is the distance between primaries and @xmath17 are the functions of time @xmath1 i.e. @xmath1 is only independent variable .",
    "the mass parameter is @xmath18(@xmath19 for the sun - jupiter and @xmath20 for the sun - earth mass distributions respectively ) .",
    "@xmath21 is a mass reduction factor , where @xmath22 is the solar radiation pressure force which is exactly apposite to the gravitational attraction force @xmath23 .",
    "the coordinates of @xmath3 , @xmath4 are @xmath24 , @xmath25 respectively . in",
    "the above mentioned reference system and @xcite model , the equations of motion of the infinitesimal mass particle in the @xmath26-plane formulated as[please see , ] : @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 from equations ( [ eq : omegax ] ) and ( [ eq : omegay ] ) , the jacobian integral is given by : @xmath30 which is related to the jacobian constant @xmath31 .",
    "the location of three collinear equilibrium points and two triangular equilibrium points is computed by dividing the orbital plane into three parts @xmath32 : @xmath33 , @xmath0 : @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath36 . for the collinear points , an algebraic equation of the fifth degree",
    "is solved numerically with initial approximations to the taylor - series as : @xmath37 the solution of differential equations ( [ eq : omegax ] ) and ( [ eq : omegay ] ) is presented as interpolation function which is plotted for various integration intervals by substituting specific values of the time @xmath1 and initial conditions i.e. @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( for the triangular equilibrium points ) .",
    "the equilibrium points are shown in figure [ fig : lpoints ] in which two panels i.e. ( i ) pink points correspond to the collinear points and black points correspond to the triangular points for the sun - earth system , whereas panel ( ii ) show the zoom of the neighborhood of @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical values of these points are presented in table [ tab : lpts ] .",
    "it is seen that the positions of @xmath41 are shifted to rightward ; @xmath42 are shifted to leftward ; and @xmath43 is also shifted to downward with respect to their positions in the classical problem .",
    "the nature of the @xmath44 is not discussed in present model because it is same as the nature of @xmath43 .",
    "but the detail behavior of the @xmath0 with stability regions is discussed in sections [ sec : trjl2 ] & [ sec : stbl2 ] .",

    "the numerical computation presented in the manuscript provides remarkable results to design trajectories of lagrangian point @xmath0 which helps us to make comments on the stability(asymptotically ) of the point .",
    "we obtained the intervals of the time where trajectory continuously moves around the @xmath0 , does not deviate far from the point but tend to approach ( for some cases ) it , the energy of perturbed point is negative for these intervals , so we conclude that the point is asymptotically stable .",
    "more over we have seen that after the specific time intervals the trajectory of perturbed point departs from the neighborhood and goes away from it , in this case the energy also becomes positive , so the lagrangian point @xmath0 is unstable .",
    "further the trajectories and the stability regions are affected by the radiation pressure , the oblateness of the second primary and mass of the belt .",
