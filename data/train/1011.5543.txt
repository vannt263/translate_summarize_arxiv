    "non - photonic electrons represent well the directions of the parent @xmath2 or @xmath3 mesons when electron @xmath0 3 gev/@xmath1 , and in the opposite direction we expect another heavy quark traversing the medium leaving an imprint on the away - side @xmath14 correlation .",
    "a similar broadness has been observed on the away - side @xmath14 correlations in 200 gev au+au and cu+cu collisions  @xcite , and the counterpart study in d+au collisions will provide a baseline for the energy loss of heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium produced in central a+a collisions .",
