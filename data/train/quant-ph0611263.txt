    "<S> environment - induced decoherence presents a great challenge to realizing a quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the somewhat surprising fact that decoherence can be useful , indeed necessary , for practical quantum computation , in particular , for the effective erasure of quantum memory in order to initialize the state of the quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> the essential point behind the deleter is that the environment , by means of a dissipative interaction , furnishes a contractive map towards a pure state . </S>",
    "<S> we present a specific example of an amplitude damping channel provided by a two - level system s interaction with its environment in the weak born - markov approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this is contrasted with a purely dephasing , non - dissipative channel provided by a two - level system s interaction with its environment by means of a quantum nondemolition interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that currently used state preparation techniques , for example using optical pumping , essentially perform as quantum deleters .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum computation is well known to solve certain types of problems more efficiently than classical computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a basic challenge facing the realization of a quantum computer is that of fighting decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> although quantum mechanical linearity endows a quantum computer with greater - than - classical power @xcite , it also imposes certain restrictions , such as the prohibition on perfect cloning @xcite and on deleting the copy of an arbitrary quantum state perfectly @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantum computational task can be broadly divided into three stages : ( 1 ) initializing the quantum computer , by preparing all qubits in a standard ` blank state ' ; ( 2 ) executing the unitary operation that performs the actual computation ; ( 3 ) performing measurements to read off results .    the well known difficulty in realizing a quantum computer is that of shielding it from the environment during step ( 2 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the problem of fighting decoherence , the loss of coherence in a system ( here a qubit ) , due to interaction with its environment , which has been the subject of intense research . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of techniques , including quantum error avoidance @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , quantum error prevention @xcite , dynamic decoupling @xcite , frequency modulation of the heat bath @xcite , fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite , decoherence - free subspaces @xcite , among others , exist to combat decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> our main aim here , however , is to point out that in one of the stages of quatum computation , decoherence is useful , even necessary .    in step ( 1 ) , we must be able to erase quantum memory of the state inherited from a previous computational task , in order to prepare the state of a quantum computer for a subsequent task . </S>",
    "<S> what is required is a quantum mechanism that with high probability allows us to prepare standard ` blank states ' , usually designated by the pure state @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that no unitary process can achieve this , since true deletion would be irreversible , and hence non - unitary . given two distinct states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a purported deleting operation @xmath3 should effect @xmath4 , which can not be satisfied unless @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> further , the no - deleting theorem implies that no qubit state can be erased against a copy @xcite .    a direct method for initializing the quantum computer would be to measure all qubits in the computational basis . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a statistical mixture of @xmath0 s and @xmath6 s , but there is no unitary way in a closed system to flip the @xmath6 s while retaining the @xmath0 s . however , open quantum systems can effect non - unitary evolution on a sub - system of interest . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus led to conclude that decoherence is in fact _ necessary _ for step 1 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , decoherence must furnish a contractive map that drives any initial state of the system towards a fixed pure state to serve as the blank state .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we use this insight to argue that decoherence can be useful to quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that a dissipative interaction with an environment can serve as an effective deleter of quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> our result is comparable to that presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the evolution of a qubit - probe system is modified by interaction with an environment , which enables the qubit to be driven to a target state , though in function , their work aims for quantum control , whereas the present proposal is aimed at state preparation . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly introduce the interaction of a two - level system ( a qubit ) with an environment ( bath ) of harmonic oscillators via a dissipative as well as non - dissipative interaction . </S>",
    "<S> our model assumes that the qubits of the computer are mutually non - interacting and decohere independently . </S>",
    "<S> however , it may be noted that in many situations this is a reasonable assumption . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , conventional quantum error - correction codes @xcite were developed primarily to deal with independent , incoherent errors . in the dissipative case </S>",
    "<S> the system - environment ( @xmath7-@xmath8 ) interaction is treated in a standard born - markov approximation . in the non - dissipative case , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7-@xmath8 interaction is of a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) type . </S>",
    "<S> these environmental interactions are representative of open system effects , and further , correspond to two of the most important noisy channels in quantum information theory . in particular , the dissipative type of system - environment interaction yields the ( generalized ) amplitude damping channel , while the non - dissipative interaction yields the phase damping channel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that whereas the former is useful to engineer a quantum deleter , the latter leads to a mixed state , which is unsuitable for state preparation . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is compatible with the fact that erasing information is an irreversible process that dissipates energy @xcite , affirming the connection between thermodynamics and information theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the total hamiltonian is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for the hamiltonians of the system , reservoir and @xmath7-@xmath8 interaction , respectively . here </S>",
    "<S> the system hamiltonian is given by @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the usual pauli matrix . </S>",
    "<S> for the reservoir hamiltonian we use the standard form of a bath of harmonic oscillators , i.e. , @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume separable initial conditions , i.e. , @xmath16 , and the reservoir is assumed to be initially in a squeezed thermal state , i.e. , a squeezed thermal bath , with an initial density matrix @xmath17 given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\hbar\\omega_k b^{\\dag}_kb_k\\right ) % \\sum\\limits_n e^{-n\\beta \\hbar \\omega_k } |n\\rangle \\langle n|    \\label{2e}\\ ] ] is the density matrix of the thermal bath , and @xmath20 \\label{2f}\\ ] ] is the squeezing operator with @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the squeezing parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> squeezing of the bath has been shown to be useful in the suppression of decay of quantum coherence @xcite , and to modify the evolution of the geometric phase of two - level quantum systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is of relevance to study its possible influence on the behavior of the quantum deleter .    </S>",
    "<S> the system - environment interaction is taken to be dissipative and of the weak born - markov type @xcite leading to a standard lindblad equation , which in the interaction picture has the following form @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , is the planck distribution giving the number of thermal photons at the frequency @xmath27 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 , and the quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the environmental squeezing parameters and @xmath31 . if @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 , then @xmath34 vanishes , and a single lindblad operator suffices .    from this , the bloch vectors can be obtained as @xcite @xmath35 \\beta(t ) \\langle \\sigma_1 ( 0 ) \\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\sin(\\phi ) \\sinh({\\gamma_0 a t \\over 2 } ) e^{-{\\gamma_0 \\over 2}(2n + 1)t } \\langle \\sigma_2 ( 0 ) \\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> the entire bloch sphere shrinks towards @xmath43 . in the absence of squeezing and at zero temperature ( @xmath46 ) </S>",
    "<S> , this action corresponds exactly to an amplitude damping channel , for which @xmath47 and thus @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the point representing the state @xmath0 ( the bloch sphere south pole in our notation ) . </S>",

    "<S> thus , the interaction with the environment provides a contractive map , such that the asymptotic state is pure ( @xmath48 ) or mixed ( @xmath50 ) , depending on environmental conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth stressing that the quantum deleter requires a dissipative interaction with its environment . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq:2b0 ] ) that for all pure states except @xmath0 , the quantity @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the bloch vector , is negative at @xmath62 , implying that the tip of the bloch vector plunges initially into the bloch sphere on its way towards the point representing the stationary state @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is reflected in the initial reduction of the length of the bloch vector , during which time , the qubit becomes increasingly entangled with the environment , before gradually factoring out .    </S>",
