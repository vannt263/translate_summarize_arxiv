    "peculiar velocities are a unique probe of the distribution of mass in the nearby universe .",
    "the velocity of an object , such as a galaxy , is the sum of two contributions : the cosmological expansion and the peculiar velocity , which arises from gravitational attractions from surrounding overdensities , which are dominated by dark matter .    in the linear regime ,",
    "the peculiar velocity @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the average density of the universe .",
    "equation ( [ peculiar ] ) is a byproduct of the assumption that structure forms as a result of the growth of small inhomogeneities in the initial density field .",
    "formally , it is valid only in the linear regime where @xmath14 i.e. , on scales larger than @xmath15 mpc . with an all - sky mass density field ,",
    "the resulting velocity field can be predicted and compared to observations .",
    "note that this velocity - velocity ( v - v ) comparison method requires a complete description of the density field , in order to use equation ( [ peculiar ] ) .",
    "there are two common approaches to estimate @xmath16 .",
    "one approach is to assume simple parametric infall models ( e.g.  `` virgo infall '' ) , and fit for parameters of the model .",
    "the second approach , adopted here , is to assume that galaxies are tracers of the mass density field . in this context , it has become a common practice to employ the simplifying assumption of linear biasing , in which @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the galaxy density contrast and @xmath19 is the bias factor relating the mass - tracer ( galaxy ) fluctuations with the mass fluctuation field . with the inclusion of linear biasing , there is a relationship between two measurable quantities , @xmath18 and @xmath20 , in terms of one unknown , @xmath21 .",
    "the velocity predictions can then be compared to measured velocities obtained through secondary distance indicators to determine the quantity @xmath3 .    in practice",
    ", one can use equation ( [ peculiar ] ) to determine @xmath22 by several methods .",
    "a direct comparison of the well - known local group ( lg ) velocity with the predicted lg velocity , @xmath23 , is one possibility .",
    "however , in practice , for any redshift survey the integral in equation ( [ peculiar ] ) is limited at some distance @xmath24 . thus determinations of @xmath3 by this method depend on the assumptions about the convergence of the dipole at the survey limit .",
    "if we approximate the contributions from beyond @xmath24 as a dipole @xmath25 , then we may express equation ( [ peculiar ] ) as @xmath26 clearly a degeneracy exists between @xmath3 and @xmath25 for the peculiar velocity of the lg . by using peculiar velocity data for many objects",
    ", one can fit for both @xmath3 and @xmath25 .",
    "alternatively , by making v - v comparisons in the lg frame , @xmath27 , then the dipole contribution @xmath25 cancels out . essentially what is being measured is infall into overdensities with known @xmath18 .",
    "it should be noted however , measured velocities are radial which means that our predictions , although three dimensional , will be converted to radial velocities .",

    "we employ the velmod technique ( willick et al .",
    "1997 ) to perform a maximum likelihood analysis which compares the redshift and distance estimates to the derived gravity field . in section [ 2mass ]",

    "we present a discussion of the results and show comparisons to values in the current literature .",
    "we now turn our attention to the construction of gravity field from the 2mass redshift survey . in",
    "what follows , we discuss the selection of the sample , general features and completeness corrections applied to the data .",
    "we discuss the properties of the luminosity function and how it relates to the weighting scheme used to define the redshift space density field .",
    "finally , we discuss the technique used to transform the data from redshift to real space .",
    "the 2mass dataset provides an all - sky view of the nearby galaxy population in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands .",
    "near - infrared light has several advantages : first , it samples the old stellar population , and hence the bulk of the stellar mass , and second it is minimally affected by dust in the galactic plane .",
    "details of how extended sources are identified are given by jarrett et al .",
    "we use 2mass data to define a @xmath31 magnitude limited sample of galaxies .",
    "redshifts and morphological type designations ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) are drawn from the hyperleda database .",
    "the selection criteria used to define the sample are as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath32 apparent magnitude @xmath33 2 .",
    "galactic latitudes @xmath34 3 .",
    "distance @xmath35 km s@xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath32 apparent magnitudes are those magnitudes defined to be within the same circular aperture for a @xmath31-band isophote of 20 mag arcsec@xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath32 apparent magnitude limit of 10.5 is chosen to yield a high redshift completeness ( @xmath38% ) for the sample .",
    "the cut in galactic latitude is chosen to reduce the incompleteness associated with galactic extinction and confusion due to the dust and stars , which increases closer to the plane of the milky way @xmath39 .",
    "the final selection criterion limits the volume to @xmath40 km s@xmath36 .",
    "given our @xmath31-band magnitude limit , beyond this distance only @xmath41 or brighter galaxies appear in the sample , hence shot noise becomes large . furthermore , previous work ( rowan - robinson et al . 2000 ; kocevski et al . 2004 ) has shown that there are few significant attractors beyond 6000 km s@xmath36 , at least until the shapley concentration is reached at 15000 km s@xmath36 .",
    "after making the distance and latitude cuts , the final magnitude limited 2mass sample comprises @xmath42 galaxies . for each object in the sample , all of the required information is known ( except for 152 with unknown morphological type ) .",
    "we have also cross - referenced these galaxies in hyperleda to obtain group identifications ( garcia et al .",
    "this was successful for @xmath43 of our sample , leaving 1815 galaxies with group designations .",
    "note that hyperleda grouping information only extends to a velocity distance of 5500 km s@xmath36 and has not been revisited even though additional galaxies have been added to the hyperleda database .",
    "the parent 2mass @xmath44 catalog has a redshift completeness of @xmath45 .",
    "the completeness is not uniform across the sky , however , and therefore small corrections are needed .",
    "since the redshift data are compiled from public sources , there are no clear boundaries .",
    "we note , however , that redshift completeness is likely affected by two selection biases : location of observatories in the northern or southern hemispheres , and extinction in the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) at low galactic latitudes .",
    "note that while the sample here is k - band selected , and hence is much less affected by extinction , redshifts are typically obtained in the optical and so the redshift completeness will still be affected by extinction .    cc    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the 2mass redshift completeness percentages in terms of the galactic latitude and declination ( d ) .",
    "while the redshifts are highly complete at high galactic latitudes , there is a decline in the completeness at lower @xmath46 . in the northern celestial hemisphere",
    ", the completeness is very high , but drops in the southern hemisphere .",
    "we also find that the redshift incompleteness is not correlated to the magnitude .",

    "the maximum likelihood solution yields best fit parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and d@xmath56 and d@xmath57 .",
    "we correct for incompleteness in @xmath19 and declination by weighting the galaxies with redshifts by @xmath58(d ) ] .      due to increasing redshift incompleteness at low galactic latitudes ,",
    "only galaxies satisfying @xmath59 were selected . leaving the unsurveyed regions empty would cause systematic errors in the dynamical model , because this region would behave as a void .",
    "this would have the effect of creating a false outflow , as can be understood through the @xmath60 term in equation ( [ peculiar ] ) .",
    "there are several ways in which this effect can be corrected .",
    "for instance , the volume can be filled with a uniform distribution of galaxies that exactly match the surveys average density .",
    "this method has the benefit of alleviating the systematic errors associated with the empty space , and since @xmath61 in this region , there is no gravitational effect .",
    "we chose instead to fill the plane by interpolating or _ cloning _ adjacent , equal area regions above and below the galactic equator ( hudson 1993 ) .",
    "due to the infrared nature of the survey , a galactic latitude cut as low as @xmath62 could be made , which meant only a relatively small strip had to be cloned , as opposed to optical surveys which typically have higher limiting @xmath46 ( santiago et al .",
    "1995 ; giuricin et al .",
    "hudson ( 1994 ) found that if uniform density was assumed then the values of @xmath3 are only @xmath63 higher .",
    "however , surveys in the zoa ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "2000 ) suggest that cloning is a better approximation .    in our cloning procedure ,",
    "the @xmath32 apparent magnitude and redshift , along with all of the other associated properties of a cloned galaxy remain the same as the parent , with the exception of a new galactic latitude which depends on the parent and cutoff galactic latitudes through , @xmath64 .      in order to correct for galaxy incompleteness due to the imposed flux limit",
    ", it is necessary to know the luminosity function ( hereafter lf ) .",
    "the empirical lf is often fitted by an analytical expression first described by schechter ( 1976 ) , @xmath66 \\frac{dl}{l^ { * } }    \\label{lf}\\ ] ] in which @xmath67 ( or equivalently @xmath68 if we describe it in terms of absolute magnitudes ) is the fiducial magnitude and represents the point in which the lf changes from a power law ( with slope @xmath69 ) to an exponential .    to estimate the lf parameters , we adopt the density - independent method of sandage et al .",
    "( 1979 ) . in section [ procedure ] below",
    ", we will outline the redshift transformation method which uses the smoothed , weighted density field to make iterative corrections to the distance of each galaxy based on an assumed @xmath3 .",
    "after each iteration , when the distances to every galaxy have been updated , we recalculate the lf parameters .",
    "thus in contrast to , for example , deep samples in which redshift is used as a proxy for distance , in our case a self - consistent set of lf parameters for each value of @xmath3 is derived .",
    "nevertheless , at low redshifts the uncertainty in a galaxy s distance due to its peculiar velocity is large , so we have used only galaxies in the distance range @xmath70 km s@xmath36 to @xmath40 km s@xmath36 to estimate the lf parameters , and excluded faint galaxies with @xmath71 .",
    "we obtain best fitting values @xmath72 ,",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 ( in @xmath75mpc@xmath76 ) from the analysis of the real space galaxy distribution ( at the best fitting @xmath3 , see section [ betaresults ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of cole et al .",

    "the likelihood analysis of the lf was performed with and without the inclusion of cloned galaxies .",
    "we find that there is no appreciable difference in either case , as expected since the sandage et al .",
    "method is density - independent . in section [ morph ]",
    "we explore how morphology affects the lf parameters by segregating the density field into early and late - types .        knowing the lf and completeness of the sample",
    ", we can calculate the selection function ( the probability that a galaxy is included in the redshift sample ) at any distance @xmath83 as , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the flux corresponding to @xmath86 . in practice the luminosity function is poorly constrained at the faint end , and hence we place a lower limit on the integral at @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 corresponds to @xmath89 , which is @xmath90 for @xmath91 mpc .",
    "we assign extra weight , @xmath92 , to galaxies with measured redshifts to account for the galaxies in the same volume that were not detected or failed to meet the selection criteria .",
    "this is equivalent to adding galaxies at every position where we have a galaxy with a measured redshift .",
    "weights are assigned to all galaxies in our sample limit , @xmath93 .",
    "galaxies outside of @xmath24 are set to a weight of zero .",
    "the sum of the weights divided by the volume within @xmath24 yields the average number density .",
    "the galaxy distribution obtained from redshift surveys is a point process .",
    "if we were to apply linear theory directly , the predictions would diverge near the weighted points .",
    "we smooth the density field so that the velocity field is continuous and so that linear theory applies .",
    "this is accomplished by applying the following equation to the density field , @xmath94\\ ] ] in which @xmath95 is a smoothing kernel and @xmath96 is the number density of the @xmath97 weighted objects .",
    "we have chosen to use a top - hat kernel in which @xmath98 for @xmath99 and set to unity otherwise .",
    "we use a fixed smoothing length @xmath100 of @xmath101 km s@xmath36 independent of distance .",
    "we now discuss the reconstruction method used to transform the measured redshifts into real space distances , @xmath83 , for the model . given a smoothed all sky density field , the peculiar velocity of any galaxy can be estimated via equation ( [ peculiar2 ] ) , and used to make distance corrections to the sample .",
    "we follow a similar method to that of yahil et al .",
    "( 1991 ) who use an iterative technique in which gravity is adiabatically `` turned on '' by increasing @xmath3 .",
    "the following outlines a recipe for a self - consistent solution to real space density and velocity maps given only positions and redshifts .    prior to the start of the iterative procedure , we collapse the so - called `` fingers of god '' ( nonlinear redshifts distortions resulting in an apparent radial stretching along the line of sight ) by placing all grouped galaxies at a common median redshift , @xmath102 , and angular position .",
    "initially , galaxies are assigned distances that are equal to their local - group - frame redshifts . a value of @xmath3 is defined at each step of the iteration and the resulting peculiar velocity field is calculated .",
    "we perform 100 steps , defining a density and velocity field at each iteration from @xmath103 to @xmath104 in steps of @xmath105 . at each iteration",
    "the following steps are performed .    1 .",
    "the likelihood function for the lf is minimized to determine the best fit parameters and a number weight is assigned to each galaxy according to its distance as described in section [ weight ] .",
    "galaxies are cloned to fill the void as described in section [ clone ] , assigning each cloned galaxy the properties of its parent , including its weight .",
    "3 .   the average density @xmath96 of all galaxies within @xmath24 is calculated .",
    "this then defines the density contrasts @xmath18 .",
    "a peculiar velocity is calculated for each galaxy using equation ( [ peculiar2 ] ) .",
    "we average the current peculiar velocity with that of the past 5 iterations .",
    "as we step through @xmath3 , we are essentially turning on the gravity , and since increases in @xmath106 are very small at each step , changes in weight and positions are also small over this range .",
    "the averaging has the benefit of damping out any unphysical oscillatory behavior + with this information we update the distance of each galaxy according to the equation for total recession velocity , @xmath107 ( where @xmath108 denotes the @xmath109 of @xmath97 galaxies ) .",
    "note that the distance to each galaxy in the sample changes at each iteration .",
    "in particular , after an iteration , a galaxy s distance may `` move '' it across @xmath24 . therefore , at each iteration , we update the positions of all galaxies with @xmath110 km s@xmath36 , which is well beyond @xmath24 .",
    "a galaxy residing in the region @xmath111 and @xmath112 km s@xmath36 is assigned a weight of zero , and therefore contributes nothing to the density and predicted peculiar velocity fields . if a subsequent iteration brings it within @xmath24 , it is assigned a weight .",
    "similarly , if an iteration brings a galaxy from @xmath113 to @xmath111 it is assigned a weight of zero . in this way",
    ", we maintain a density field based on a self - consistent distance limit @xmath24 .",
    "we repeat the above steps at each iteration .",

    "1996 ) is not in our sample because of its low galactic latitude ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "however , the dynamical influence of a single cluster , even a massive one such as abell 3627 , is small .",
    "instead the peculiar velocity field is more strongly affected by the large - scale overdensity of the supercluster as a whole .",
    "it is these large - scale overdensities that are crudely reproduced by our cloning procedure .",

    "the 2mass @xmath3 values agree quite well with iras values .",
    "however , when comparing the 2mass predictions of @xmath3 to the iras values , one should keep in mind that the iras samples are dominated by late - type galaxies . consequently , the strength of the clustering , or bias , is likely to differ and the comparisons of @xmath3 may not be straight forward . with this in mind , it is preferable to transform the results into a form that is independent of the details of the density field used .",
    "this can be accomplished by noting that the linear biasing factor @xmath19 relates the r.m.s .",
    "galaxy fluctuations , @xmath170 , to the amplitude of r.m.s .",
    "mass fluctuations , @xmath171 , where the subscript 8 indicates that the density fluctuations have been averaged in top - hat spheres of radius @xmath172 @xmath0mpc .",

    "we have measured directly the r.m.s fluctuations in 8 @xmath0 mpc spheres .",
    "allowing for shot noise , we find a value of @xmath174 ( in reconstructed `` real '' space ) .",
    "we have not measured the uncertainty in this quantity , but note that this result is consistent with @xmath175 found by maller et al .",

    "luminosity - dependent biasing may account for some of the difference between these results . here",
    "we adopt @xmath177 to obtain the result @xmath178 .",
    "we note that the is dominant contribution to the uncertainty is from the uncertainty in @xmath179 .",
    "we expect that @xmath179 will be better determined in the near future from the 2mass redshift survey ( huchra 2000 ) .    for the iras survey",

    "for the iras case , the v - v results have been combined to yield an average iras value @xmath182 .",
    "there is good agreement between the various methods and data sets used in @xmath3 determinations from peculiar velocity studies .",
    "the iras result is tighter than our result because @xmath183 is better constrained and more peculiar velocity data have been compared to iras predictions .",
    "a weighted average of iras and 2mass results gives @xmath184 .",
    "feldman et al . ( 2003 ) measured the mean relative peculiar velocity for pairs of galaxies , and in comparison with the correlation function , derived a value of @xmath185 for @xmath186 , which is consistent with our result .",
    "feldman et al . do not quote a result for the combination @xmath187 , which one would expect to have smaller errors , than the marginal errors on @xmath171 and @xmath188 separately .    unlike the v - v comparisons",
    ", values can also be obtained by density - density ( @xmath189 ) comparisons .",
    "previously , this method required the construction of the gravitation potential from the radial velocity field ( potent ; bertschinger & dekel 1989 ) , differentiation and comparison it to the galaxy density field derived from redshift survey data .",
    "note that such comparisons are based on smoothing and differentiating sparse and noisy peculiar velocity data . using this method , sigad et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found @xmath190 . a newer method based on an unbiased variant of the weiner filter yields values that are more consistent with those of the v - v method : @xmath191 ( zaroubi et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it is possible to use peculiar velocities to obtain estimates of @xmath3 in a completely different way .",
    "peculiar velocities of galaxies distort the pattern of galaxy clustering in redshift space , making the redshift space power spectrum anisotropic .",
    "one can use the distortions to measure the parameter @xmath3 , and with information about the density field obtain the cosmological constraint @xmath192 .",
    "we combine the measured @xmath170 for the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) by lahav et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with the 2dfgrs @xmath3 result of hawkins et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to obtain the combination @xmath193 . similarly , percival et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used a spherical harmonics method on the 2dfgrs to find @xmath194 .",
    "these are in good agreement with our result .",
    "the comparisons between peculiar velocity derived values of @xmath192 can be extended to other cosmological data .",
    "for instance , refregier ( 2003 ) compiled an average @xmath195 value based on many weak lensing survey results for the assumed cosmology defined by @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 .",
    "contaldi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) plus weak lensing results to constrain the combination at @xmath199 .",
    "tegmark et al . (",
    "2004 ) used recent cmb and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) power spectra to find @xmath200 under the assumption of a flat , @xmath201 universe .",
    "similarly , seljak et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , combined wmap with sdss clustering , bias and ly@xmath202 forest data to obtain @xmath203 ( assuming a flat universe with free @xmath204 ) . using cmb and 2dfgrs data , sanchez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find @xmath205 assuming ( flat , @xmath201 ) .",
    "sanchez et al .  do not quote errors for the combination @xmath206 , so above we have calculated the error assuming that the uncertainty in @xmath188 and @xmath171 are independent . since their figure 1 indicates that these parameters are not independent , the above uncertainty will be an overestimate .",
    "although the conflict is not significant , it is interesting that the sanchez et al .",
    "result is lower than the cmb plus sdss values , the 2dfgrs redshift - space distortion results , as well as our result .",
    "overall , our peculiar velocity results are in good agreement with a broad variety of recent @xmath207 measurements from the literature .",
    "although the focus of this paper has been on the gravity and peculiar velocity field within @xmath24 , there are important gravitational sources beyond this limit . while the existence of these sources do not affect our @xmath7 results ( as we have preformed the analysis in the lg frame where external contributions are negligible ) , we can turn the problem around and place constraints on the large scale flow using our value of @xmath7 .",
    "specifically , for the best fitting @xmath208 , we calculate a lg velocity @xmath209 km s@xmath36 in the direction @xmath210 , @xmath211 .",
    "the uncertainty on this linear theory predict ion is underestimated , because we expect that part of the lg s motion is not well described by linear theory .",
    "since the lg is a galaxy group , and the relative infall of the milky way and andromeda has already been accounted for following yahil et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , it should be less affected by nonlinearities than are individual galaxies .",
    "it seems reasonable to adopt a thermal velocity dispersion of @xmath212 km s@xmath36 , making @xmath213 uncertain at the @xmath43 level .",
    "thus for our best fit @xmath3 , the local volume does not fully account for the lg s motion with respect to the cmb , and there is a residual velocity dipole of @xmath214 km s@xmath36 in the direction @xmath215 , @xmath216 .",
    "this residual dipole is slightly lower than , but consistent with , the result of hudson ( 1994b ) , who compared the predictions of an optically - selected galaxy density field to @xmath217 and tully - fisher peculiar velocities and found @xmath218 and a residual velocity , from beyond @xmath219mpc , of @xmath220 km s@xmath36 toward @xmath221 , @xmath222 .",
    "the residual lg dipole found here is in good agreement with a recent estimate of the bulk flow of @xmath223 km s@xmath36 toward @xmath215 , @xmath224 found by hudson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , for a sample of peculiar velocities at depths greater than @xmath225 mpc .",
    "thus , our derived @xmath7 suggests that there are significant contributions ( @xmath226% ) to the lg s motion arising from sources at @xmath227mpc .",
    "in this paper we have used the 2mass catalog and public redshift data to reconstruct the local density field . under the assumption of gi and we used linear theory to derive the peculiar velocity fields which we compared to measured peculiar velocity data .",
    "the different data sets all yield results from the velmod method that are in very good agreement , with a best fit @xmath167 .",
    "calculation of the r.m.s .",
    "density fluctuations of k - selected galaxies allowed us to generalize the result as @xmath228 .",
    "our result is consistent with previous determinations of redshift space distortion methods , cmb and weak lensing results .",
    "the low value of @xmath3 suggests that significant contributions to the lg s motion arise from beyond @xmath229mpc .",
    "we would like to stress the power of the method that we have outlined here .",
    "peculiar velocity comparisons provide direct and independent measures of @xmath192 , which are consistent with results from a wide range of techniques .",
    "peculiar velocities probe scales near the fiducial @xmath230mpc scale and allows us to make these predictions without any assumptions regarding the background cosmology .",
    "all that is required is a source of redshift data , and a sample of galaxies which have redshift - independent distance information .",
    "this illustrates the power of peculiar velocity studies to probe the underlying cosmology .    in future peculiar velocity work , it may be possible to break the degeneracy between @xmath231 and @xmath19 by applying a more sophisticated biasing model , such as a nonlinear bias based on the _ halo model _ ( e.g.  marinoni & hudson 2002 ) .",
    "improving the predictions in the mildly nonlinear regime ( e.g.  nusser & branchini 2000 ) will be important for this latter goal .",
    "furthermore , a deeper and more complete 2mass data set will reduce the errors associated with sparseness and enable a better reconstruction of the local density field .",
    "similar improvement will come with more reliable distance estimates and larger peculiar velocity surveys .",
    "for instance , wang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are currently working on compiling a sample of sn ia that have distance errors , as low as @xmath232 , although the sample is still quite small at present .",
    "as the data and techniques continue to improve , the future of peculiar velocity studies will continue to be a promising area for understanding the mass distribution in the local universe .",
    "the authors would like to thank riccardo giovanelli for providing us with a tabulated version of the sfi peculiar velocities .",
    "we also thank christian marinoni for interesting discussions in the early phases of this project .",
