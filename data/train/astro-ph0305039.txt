    "it is a sixth order algebraic equation and it provides the following three quadratic relations between dynamical variables :    @xmath32    @xmath33    from now on , we assume @xmath3 , since in the case of scalar field nonsingular solutions were obtained only for negative @xmath2 @xcite . in the case",

    "they are hyperbolas ( see fig.[fig : edge ] ) with asymptotes    @xmath34    notice , that asymptotes do not depend on the value of parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it is possible to show , that in the case @xmath3 sign `` + '' in ( [ dynsys ] ) corresponds to positive hubble parameter , and , sign `` - '' takes place for negative hubble parameter .",
    "therefore for analysis of stage of expansion we will take equations ( [ dynsys ] ) with sign `` + '' , and for contraction stage we will use sign `` - '' in ( [ dynsys ] ) .",
    "we will formally consider infinite phase space , i.e. phase trajectories could go to infinity .",
    "notice , however , that from the physical point of view , when the energy density ( [ phicon ] ) becomes larger than the planckian value ( @xmath35 ) , quantum gravity is needed .",
    "therefore clear physical interpretation is possible only for those trajectories , that lay inside the quantum edge @xmath36 .    in the finite region of the phase plane \\{@xmath37 } there is only one singular point , namely the point \\{@xmath38}. in the limit @xmath39,@xmath40 the system ( [ dynsys ] ) is reduced to the case of gr .",

    "since at the inflationary separatrix @xmath44 ( and @xmath45 ) the effective equation of state is @xmath46 , i.e. inflationary stage takes place @xcite .",

    "the field oscillates near the point \\{@xmath38 } with damped amplitude .",

    "they are repulsive separatrices .    on the opposite , on the stage of contraction",
    "the inflationary separatrix is repulsive , and most initial conditions lead to the effective equation of state @xmath47 .",
    "it is well known , that within the framework of gr cosmological models with such equation of state have singularity in future at the stage of contraction . however , since in the gtg case there are two edges of the physical regions , the subsequent evolution of the model changes significantly .",
    "the edges of the physical region become attractive separatrices at the stage of contraction .",
    "most trajectories finish at these edges .",
    "notice , that since the edges are hyperbolas , i.e. infinite curves , dynamical variables tend to infinity in the course of time .",
    "since the main difference between gr and gtg cases occurs at the contraction stage , below we consider @xmath48 everywhere .",
    "note , that at the stage of contraction fig.[fig:00 ] must be reflected with respect to the vertical axis .",
    "the asymptotic behavior can be characterized by the effective equation of state .",
    "taking into account ( [ phicon ] ) and ( [ asympt ] ) one arrives to    @xmath49    thus , within the framework of gtg the effective equation of state for cosmological models with scalar field is the equation of state for ultrarelativistic gas . and we believe that it is quite a common feature . ] note , that in the case of equation of state ( [ effeqst ] ) the cosmological equations ( [ gcfe],[heqn1 ] ) reduce to einstein equations of gr .",
    "hubble parameter can be calculated when the scalar field reaches the separatrix ( [ roots ] ) .",
    "the corresponding value is    @xmath50    and tends to asymptotic value    @xmath51    therefore the hubble parameter becomes constant and relatively small , taking into account that typical values of the mass are @xmath52 @xcite . in infinite future",
    "the contraction with constant speed will lead to singularity .",
    "most trajectories finish at this state on the stage of contraction .    to find all singular points of the system ( [ dynsys ] ) we use the standard technique of projection of infinite space into the lower hemisphere of the sphere with unit radius , so called poincare sphere .",

    "@xmath55{3 in } { \\epsfig{file = inf2.eps , width=3in}}\\ ] ]    there are two knots , two saddles and one spiral focus ( that we discussed in the previous section ) in both cases . in the gr case knots",
    "lay at the axis @xmath56 and saddles lay at the axis @xmath57 at infinity of the real phase space .    in the case of gtg two knots lay at the point , where asymptotes ( [ asympt ] ) cross the radius of the circle .",
    "notice again , that the tilt of asymptotes does not depend on parameter @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , in new variables the form of equation ( [ asympt ] ) is conserved .",
    "it could be seen , that the tilt of asymptotes ( [ asympt ] ) tends to zero with zero mass , i.e. it is possible to make the hyperbolas ( [ roots ] ) as flat as we wish .",
    "taking into account that at the stage of contraction the hyperbolas ( [ roots ] ) are attractive separatrices , the question arise , what is the effective equation of state of the scalar field on these hyperbolas .    from ( [ phicon ] ) and ( [ roots ] ) we have    @xmath58    therefore    @xmath59",
    "the two limiting cases take place when the scalar field and its derivative with respect to time tend to infinity and to zero correspondingly .",
    "it was argued in @xcite,@xcite that it is possible to built nonsingular inflationary cosmological models within the framework of gr .",
    "however , in spite of the fact that such models could exist , according to the analysis of @xcite their measure is equal to zero , because on contraction stage effective equation of state tends to @xmath0 , that lead to cosmological singularity for most solutions .",
    "according to @xcite , the possibility to avoid cosmological singularity remains if `` physical conditions leading to the bounce take place at the end of cosmological compression '' .",
    "it should be clear , however , that in this case nonsingular solutions have much less attractive character , because they necessarily require special physical conditions , for instance phase transitions , at the bounce .",
    "such models are already discussed in the literature @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the analysis presented in the paper shows that the similar situation takes place within the framework of gtg in the case of flat models .",
    "since cosmological equations of gtg are much more complicated than than of gr , they possess a wide spectrum of solutions that is absent in the case of gr .",
    "in particular , there are oscillating solutions @xcite in the case of closed models for the universe , filled by nonlinear scalar field .",
    "however , such solutions have nothing to do with inflation .",
    "we conclude therefore that attempts to build nonsingular inflationary cosmological models within framework of gr as well as gtg lead to serious complications connected with domination of scalar field on the stage of contraction .",
    "the analysis carried out in this paper shows that the dynamics of the flat cosmological models with massive scalar field within the framework of gtg differs significantly from the corresponding behavior within gr . in the phase space",
    "there are regions when the scalar field acquires imaginary part .",
    "corresponding regions are unphysical .",
    "the edges of the physical regions are hyperbolas , symmetric with respect to the axis @xmath60 .    at the stage of expansion",
    "most phase trajectories , that start at some point inside the quantum edge , i.e. the region , where the energy density is smaller than the planckian value , tend to inflationary separatrix . therefore , inflationary solutions are quite generic feature of cosmological models within gtg .    at the stage of contraction the dynamics of cosmological models within framework of gtg changes significantly in comparison with corresponding dynamics within gr due to the presence of attractive separatrices . before reaching the separatrix the effective equation of state of the model is @xmath47 like in the case of gr . on the separatrix the equation of state tends to the limiting case @xmath1 .",
    "the hubble parameter at the stage of compression tends to the limiting value @xmath61 , and corresponding models have a cosmological singularity in infinite future .",
    "therefore , nonsingular inflationary solutions are unstable within the framework of gtg .",
    "this conclusion is applicable in part to closed and open cosmological models with negligible curvature due to continuity of the phase space ."
