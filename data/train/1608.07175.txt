    "[ [ section ] ]    when experimenting with primes in division algebras , an affinity of primes in @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the structure in the standard model of particle physics emerged : primes in @xmath0 resemble leptons , while equivalence classes of primes in @xmath1 have hadron like features @xcite . in @xmath0 , where besides the ramified gaussian primes of norm @xmath6 like @xmath7 , two other type of primes exist",
    ", there is a lepton structure : in @xmath0 we see cartoon versions of neutrini as well as electron - positron pairs . in @xmath1 , where besides the ramified primes above @xmath8 , only one type of primes exists , modulo @xmath9 gauge transformations , the structure of @xmath10-equivalence classes appear to be  hadrons",
    "\" : there are either mesons or baryons , where the individual elements of the equivalence classes resemble quarks .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the algebras @xmath11 are naturally distinguished as these two are the only complete associative normed division algebras .",
    "not only the unit spheres @xmath4 of in @xmath11 but also the lie group @xmath3 acts on spheres in @xmath1 by diffeomorphisms rotating three complex planes hinged together at the real axes .",
    "this non - linear action allows to implement more symmetries or extend any quantum dynamics from @xmath0 to @xmath1 valued fields .",
    "these symmetries lead to finite norm preserving group actions on quaternion integers and can be implemented without mentioning lie groups : the weak equivalence is obtained by using multiplication by units in @xmath1 ; the strong symmetries on integers @xmath12 in @xmath1 is generated by the 24 permutations or sign changes .",
    "obviously this can be realized using both rotations or reflections in @xmath2 or then by permutations and sign changes in the space components @xmath13 of the quaternion .",
    "the upshot is that every integer has a strong equivalence class @xmath12 with non - negative entries where @xmath14 .",
    "if we look at weak equivalence classes in such integer classes , the result is that each class has either one , two or three elements , where the case with one element only happens if @xmath15 .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the fact that the major gauge groups of the standard model appear as symmetries in @xmath1 suggests to look at * quaternion quantum mechanics * , where waves are @xmath1-valued .",
    "such a physics could be realized by looking at quaternion valued wave equations developed by fueter @xcite who also noticed that the dirac equation in quaternion analysis plays the role of the cauchy - riemann differential equations .",
    "alternatively , one can extend linear or nonlinear wave evolutions from @xmath0-valued fields in sub planes to quaternion - valued fields : just evolve simultaneously the classical waves on planes spanned by @xmath16 and one of the spacial units like @xmath17 in @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath18 is any self - adjoint hamiltonian operator , then instead of quantum dynamics @xmath19 for a wave @xmath20 , one can consider two other waves @xmath21 and evolve all simultaneously using @xmath22 .",
    "this assures that @xmath23 stays invariant .",
    "the three evolutions can be merged together to a quaternion with this norm @xmath24 by putting @xmath25 and @xmath26 with sign @xmath27 chosen so that @xmath28 has positive jacobean .",
    "this assures that @xmath29 is time invariant .",
    "the second equivalence relation , the @xmath10 symmetry comes from the cayley - dickson picture expressing @xmath12 as a pair of two complex numbers @xmath30 for which @xmath31 with the complex matrix @xmath32 built by pauli matrices .",
    "these weak symmetries on @xmath33 can be implemented as determinant preserving unitary @xmath34 matrices and so by elements in @xmath10 . obviously , the weak and strong equivalence classes are different . looking at both together in @xmath1 gives the hadron structure on primes .",
    "this amusing fact is is pure finite combinatorics .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    one can ask now why number theory should matter in quantum dynamics , as a random quaternion is almost surely never an integer .",
    "one can look however at the dynamics on a  geometry \" , a space @xmath35 with exterior derivative and measure @xmath36 , where one classically evolves waves in @xmath37 , moving according to some dynamics in the hilbert space @xmath38 with norm @xmath39 .",
    "the quaternion quantum evolution preserves this norm but at individual points @xmath40 , the wave amplitude changes .",
    "gauge symmetry now can render integers relevant : if a wave amplitude reaches integer arithmetic @xmath1 norm @xmath41 at some point , the wave value @xmath42 can be gauged within the gauge groups to become @xmath1-integer valued at this point .",
    "its prime factorization structure features now particles at this point .",
    "the switch of factorizations could now be seen as particle processes in which fermions = odd primes exchange vector gauge bosons = units or ramified primes = neutral bosons .",
    "unit migration is an exchange of bosons and recombination is particle pair creation or annihilation , mending in some way also the particle - wave duality conundrum .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    this picture most certainly is just an allegory or caricature even in the realm of particle phenomenology alone when disregarding dynamics : the reason is that even the simplest processes like * beta decay of a neutron * @xmath43 to a proton , electron , electron neutrino , or a * pion decay * @xmath44 , where a meson decays into two leptons can not be explained by unit migration , recombination or meta commutation in @xmath1 alone .",
    "also , the way , how charge is defined below , no baryons do exist for which all three quarks have charge @xmath45 .",
    "this violates the existence of the @xmath46 baryon .",
    "we believe however that the definition of charge given here can be modified to incorporate this .",
    "we have just chosen an algorithm ( using lipschitz or hurwitz primes ) which gives us a deterministic charge .",
    "there is no other reason why @xmath47 charge triplets are excluded .",
    "+    [ [ section-5 ] ]    the picture drawn here is probably of little value for physics as the later by definition requires to be able to do * quantitative predictions * or * quantitative verifications * of experimentally observable processes .",
    "and the picture drawn here does neither .",
    "we feel however that the story is of mathematical interest and that it motivates to look more closely at higher arithmetic in @xmath1 as well at the mathematical structure of standard model which appears to suffer from a * lack of inevitability*. while the standard model is one of the most successful physical theories with excellent match between experiment and model , the structure of the involved lagrangians is complicated even if one looks at it from a non - commutative geometry point of view .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    affinities between mathematical structures and physical phenomena are sometimes useful , sometimes just amusing .",
    "here is an example of the more amusing type @xcite : when looking at the rubik group , a finite group , there are permutations available when disassembling and recombining the actual cube which resemble quarks : turn a corner cube by 120 degrees for example . rotating one corner and other corner in the opposite direction gives a quark - anti quark meson and this permutation is realizable .",
    "turning three corners by 120 degree can physically be realized and resembles a baryon .",
    "also this picture is useless for physics but it is of some value as it helps to learn more about the structure of that particular finite group .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    the standard model does not answer why the number of generations of hadrons or leptons is limited to three or why the gauge groups are not unified to a larger group like @xmath48 predicted by some grand unified theories .",
    "we have seen that @xmath1 naturally features the gauge groups of the standard model , even so the @xmath3 symmetry acts only by diffeomorphisms .",
    "the three generations can emerge naturally in a quaternion - valued quantum mechanics as we have to evolve waves in three different planes .",
    "since the time scales in the different planes are in general different ( as there is no reason why they should agree ) , a particle involving in a faster plane appears to be lighter .",
    "better than * imposing * a wave evolution is to let the system just evolve freely in its isospectral set .",
    "wave dynamics then emerges naturally @xcite in the form of isospectral lax deformations of exterior derivatives leading to three generations of geometries .",
    "as both leptons and hadrons move in at least one plane and more likely in 2 or 3 planes at the same time , the probability of having a light particles is larger .",
    "the heavier particles like the top quark are more rare .",
    "the neutrini in the intersection of these planes participate to any of three dynamics producing thought associations with the observed phenomenon of neutrino oscillations .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    number theory in @xmath1 has started with hurwitz @xcite who built the setup and established some factorization features .",
    "the fundamental theorem of arithmetic in @xmath1 was completed @xcite .",
    "the fact that quaternions were an outcast in part of the 20th century can historically be traced to the success of vector calculus , especially as formulated by gibbs and wilson @xcite , a book so successful that its content not only structured practically all modern calculus textbooks but also removed quaternions from the curricula .",
    "quaternion calculus was still cultivated , like by the swiss number theorist rudolf fueter who found a cauchy integral theorem for quaternions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is certainly much still to be explored . only recently",
    ", the permutation structure of the meta - commutation in the prime factorization has been studied for the first time @xcite .",

    "it is natural to ask for a relation between the frobenius and hurwitz theorem .",
    "note that the frobenius theorem does not assume  normed `` but makes an associativity assumption .",
    "but there seems no obvious link between the frobenius and hurwitz statements , as the class of ' ' normed division algebras `` and ' ' division algebras `` is different and associativity is quite a strong assumption .",
    "the question asks whether there could be dependencies between the proofs of the theorems .",
    "the answer is probably ' ' no `` : going from frobenius to hurwitz requires to get rid of the attributes ' ' associative , finite dimensional `` and adding ' ' normed \" instead .",
    "historically , hurwitz paper was only published posthumously and does not cite frobenius even so hurwitz ( 1859 - 1919 ) and frobenius ( 1849 - 1917 ) were contemporaries and both worked in zurich .",
