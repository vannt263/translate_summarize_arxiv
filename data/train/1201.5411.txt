    "this paper touches some topics in sub - fields of information theory that are usually of interest to different communities . for this reason",
    ", we introduce this work with an overview of the different contexts .",
    "one of the central topics in coding theory is the problem of bounding the probability of error of optimal codes for communication over a given channel . in his 1948 landmark paper @xcite ,",
    "shannon introduced the notion of channel capacity , which represents the largest rate at which information can be sent through the channel with vanishing probability of error .",
    "this means that , at rates strictly smaller than the capacity @xmath0 , communication is possible with a probability of error that vanishes with increasing block - length . in the following years",
    ", an important refinement of this fundamental result was obtained in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular",
    ", it was proved that the probability of error @xmath1 for the optimal encoding strategy at rates below the capacity vanishes exponentially fast in the block - length , a fact that we can express as @xmath2 where @xmath1 is the probability of error , @xmath3 is the block - length and @xmath4 is a function of the rate @xmath5 , called _ channel reliability _ , which is positive ( possibly infinite ) for all rates smaller than the capacity .",
    "while shannon s theorem made the evaluation of the capacity relatively simple , determining the function @xmath4 soon turned out to be a very difficult problem .",
    "as shannon himself first observed and studied @xcite , for a whole class of channels , communication is possible at sufficiently low but positive rates @xmath5 with probability of error precisely equal to zero , a fact that is usually described by saying that function @xmath4 is infinite at those rates .",
    "shannon defined the zero - error capacity @xmath6 of a channel as the supremum of all rates at which communication is possible with probability of error exactly equal to zero .",
    "this problem soon appeared as one of a radically different nature from that of determining the traditional capacity .",
    "the zero - error capacity only depends on the confusability graph of the channel , and determining its value is usually considered to be a problem of a combinatorial nature rather than of a probabilistic one @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "since @xmath6 is precisely the smallest value of @xmath5 for which @xmath4 is finite , it is clear that determining the precise value of @xmath4 for general channels is expected to be a problem of exceptional difficulty .",
    "the first bounds to @xmath6 were obtained by shannon himself @xcite . in particular",
    ", he gave the first non - trivial upper bound in the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the zero - error capacity with feedback , which he was able to determine exactly by means of a clever combinatorial approach .",
    "in the following years , works by fano @xcite , shannon , gallager and berlekamp @xcite , @xcite were devoted to the problem of bounding the function @xmath4 for general discrete memoryless channels .",
    "the function could be determined exactly for all rates larger than some critical rate @xmath9 , but no general solution could be found for lower rates , something that was however surely expected in light of the known hardness of even determining the value @xmath6 at which @xmath4 must diverge .",
    "an important result , based on large deviation techniques in probability theory , was the so called sphere packing upper bound , that is , the determination of a function @xmath10 such that @xmath11 for all rates @xmath5 .",
    "the smallest rate @xmath12 for which @xmath10 is finite is clearly also an upper bound to @xmath6 , and it turned out , quite nicely , that @xmath13 ( whenever @xmath14 ) .",
    "so , the same bound obtained by shannon with a combinatorial approach based on the use of feedback could also be obtained indirectly from a bound based on a probabilistic argument .",
    "we may say that upper bounds to @xmath4 and upper bounds to @xmath6 were somehow `` coherent '' .",
    "there was however only a partial coherence .",
    "in fact , channels with the same confusability graph can have different @xmath12 .",
    "this means that the tightest bound to @xmath6 for a given channel , obtained by minimizing @xmath12 over all channels with the same confusability graph , could be smaller than the rate @xmath12 of that channel . in that case , in a range of values of the rate @xmath5 , no upper bound to @xmath4 was available even though this quantity was already known to be finite .",
    "the situation remained as such until 1979 , when lovsz published his ground - breaking paper @xcite .",
    "lovsz obtained a new upper bound to @xmath6 based on his theta function @xmath15 which , among other things , allowed him to precisely determine the capacity of the pentagon , the simplest graph for which shannon was not able to determine the capacity .",
    "lovsz interest for this problem , however , came from a purely graph theoretic context , and his approach was combinatorial in nature , _ apparently _ very different from the probabilistic techniques previously used in channel coding theory .",
    "lovsz contribution is usually considered a clear indication that bounding @xmath6 is a problem that must be attacked with techniques developed under the context of combinatorics rather than under the probabilistic one .",
    "links between lovsz contribution and classical coding theory results ( see for example @xcite ) have probably not been strong enough to avoid a progressive independent development of a new research branch without further advances in the study of error probability of optimal codes at low rates .",
    "lovsz theta function was recognized as a fundamental quantity in combinatorial optimization due to its relevant algebraic properties ; to date , it is usually interpreted in the context of semidefinite relaxation / programming and it is probably more used in mathematics and computer science than in information theory ( see for example @xcite for more details , or @xcite for more recent developments ) . as an effect of this trend , no advances in bounding @xmath4 for general channels with a zero - error capacity",
    "were made after the appearance of lovsz work .",
    "perhaps lovsz method was so combinatorially oriented that it appeared difficult to exploit it in the probabilistic context within which bounds to @xmath4 were usually developed . since 1979 , thus , contrarily to what happened in the 60s , a `` gap '' exists between bounds to @xmath4 and bounds to @xmath6 .",
    "one of the main objectives of this paper is to show that lovsz work and the sphere packing bound of shannon , gallager and berlekamp rely on a similar idea , which can be described in a unified way in probabilistic terms if one moves to the more general setting of quantum probability .",
    "the right context is that of classical - quantum channels ; for these channels , equivalent definitions of capacity , zero - error capacity and reliability function can be given with exact analogy with the classical case .    in this paper , we prove the sphere packing bound for classical - quantum channels and we show that lovsz result emerges naturally as a consequence of this bound . in particular , we show that when the rate @xmath12 is minimized not just over classical channels but over classical - quantum channels with a given confusability graph , then the achieved minimum is precisely the lovsz theta function .",
    "figure [ fig : quant_prob ] gives a pictorial representation of the resulting scenario .",
    "at which the sphere packing bound @xmath16 diverges equals the zero - error capacity with feedback ( if @xmath17 ) , a quantity originally studied with a combinatorial approach . in the quantum context , channels exist for which @xmath12 equals the lovasz theta function , a more powerful upper bound on @xmath6 , also usually introduced in a combinatorial setting , for which no probabilistic interpretation has been given before . ]",
    "this shows that classical - quantum channels provide the right context for making bounds to @xmath4 and bounds to @xmath6 coherent again at least to the same extent as they had been in the 60s .    in this paper , however , we also attempt to make a first step toward a real unification of bounds to @xmath4 and bounds to @xmath6 , which means that for any channel one has a finite upper bound to @xmath4 for each @xmath5 that is known to be larger than @xmath6 .",
    "there are different ways of attempting such a unification .",
    "this paper focuses on an approach inspired by a common idea in lovsz construction and in the expurgated _ lower _ bound to @xmath4 of gallager @xcite .",
    "the resulting _ upper _ bound to @xmath4 is in many cases not tight at even moderately high rates .",
    "it has however the nice property of being finite over the same range of rate values for all channels with the same confusability graph , and of giving a powerful bound to @xmath6 as a consequence of bounds to @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , this approach reveals interesting connections between the lovsz theta function , the cutoff rate of classical channels , the expurgated bound of gallager and the rate @xmath12 of classical - quantum channels .",
    "the resulting situation in the general case is qualitatively depicted in figure [ fig : umbrella ] .",
    "the bounds obtained in this paper are simply sketched in order to clarify that we do not claim any tightness .",
    "we believe however that the presented ideas shed some light on an unexplored path that deserves further study .    the final objective of an investigation on this topic should be a bound , that we also symbolically show in figure [ fig : umbrella ] , that smoothly departs from the sphere packing bound to diverge at @xmath18 .",
    "we believe any result in this direction would be fundamental to coding theory and combinatorics .     for classical channels derived in this paper and other known quantities .",
    "a `` desirable '' upper bound to @xmath4 is also shown in the figure that smoothly corrects the sphere packing bound to meet @xmath15 ; this should be target of future works in this direction . ]",
    "when bounding the function @xmath4 near the zero - error capacity , in fact , we are faced with the problem of finding a trade - off between probabilistic and combinatorial methods .",
    "bounds to @xmath4 for general non - symmetric channels usually require probabilistic methods , while effective bounds to @xmath6 , like lovsz theta function , seem to require a combinatorial approach . in this paper",
    ", we suggest the use of quantum probability and quantum information theory , even for the classical problem , as a mean to expand the probabilistic setting toward the domain of combinatorics . in this work ,",
    "we show that by expanding the probabilistic approach of @xcite for bounding @xmath4 to the quantum case , we already recover such a powerful combinatorial result as lovsz bound to @xmath6 .",
    "thus , quantum probability represents a promising approach for finding a unified derivation of effective bounds to @xmath4 and to @xmath6 even in the classical setting .",
    "this point of view may be considered also in light of a trend , which has emerged in recent years , which sees quantum probability methods used for the derivation of classical results ( see for example the survey @xcite ) . from the classical point of view",
    ", one may regard quantum probability as a purely mathematical tool and may want to investigate this tool without any reference to any _ quantum _ theory . in this perspective , one may ask where these benefits of quantum probability really come from , in mathematical terms . to give a very concise partial answer to this question , one may say that while classical probability finds its roots in the use of distributions as vectors in the simplex , which are unit norm vectors under the @xmath19 norm , quantum probability hinges around the use of wave functions as vectors on the unit sphere , that is unit norm vectors under the @xmath20 norm ( see @xcite and , for example , @xcite or @xcite for the reasons behind the need of using the @xmath19 or the @xmath20 norms ) . in coding theory , when working in the low rate region , what moves the problem from the probability domain into combinatorics is the increasing importance of very small error probability events .",
    "optimal codewords are associated to conditional output distributions represented by almost orthogonal vectors which all lie very close to the boundary of the simplex ( actually on the boundary in the case of zero - error codes ) .",
    "the use of quantum probability may be seen as a form of relaxation of the classical problem where the smooth unit sphere is used in place of the probability simplex , so as to overcome the difficulties encountered when working too close to the contour .",
    "lovsz own result , on the other hand , can be interpreted in this way . as will be seen in section [ sec : umbrella ]",
    ", the vectors used in lovsz representations essentially play the same role of the square roots of channel transition probabilities .",
    "the main difference is that lovsz allows for negative components in these vectors , which have no intuitive meaning in the classical probabilistic description of the problem .",
    "the true benefit of these negative components is that , in the study of the @xmath3-fold channel extension , they allow to `` generate '' orthogonal codewords by exploiting what could be called , inspired by physics , `` interference '' between positive and negative components , something which can not be done using classical probability theory .",
    "the idea of extending the domain in order to solve a problem has in the end proved unavoidable in many different cases in mathematics .",
    "integer valued sequences , like fibonacci s , can usually only be represented in closed form using irrational numbers ; the solutions to general cubic equations , even when all of them are real , can only be expressed by means of radicals by resorting to the complex numbers ; many integrals and series in the real domain are much easily solved in the complex plane , etc .",
    "we believe that this extension of the working domain will be highly beneficial in coding theory as well .",
    "as already mentioned , classical - quantum channels play a central role in this paper .",
    "a number of results in the theory of classical communication through classical - quantum channels have been obtained in the past years that parallel many of the results obtained in the period 1948 - 1965 for classical channels ( see @xcite for a very comprehensive overview ) . as in the classical case , we are here primarily concerned with the study of error exponents for optimal transmission at rates below the channel capacity .",
    "upper bounds to the probability of error of optimal codes for pure - state channels were obtained by burnashev and holevo @xcite that are the equivalent of the so called random coding bound obtained by fano @xcite and gallager @xcite and of the expurgated bound of gallager @xcite for classical channels .",
    "the expurgated bound was then extended to general quantum channels by holevo @xcite .",
    "the formal extension of the random coding bound expression to mixed states is conjectured to represent an upper bound for the general case but no proof has been obtained yet ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a missing step in these quantum versions of the classical results is an equivalent of the sphere packing bound .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that a complete solution to the problem of determining the asymptotic error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing has been obtained only recently . in particular ,",
    "the so called _ quantum chernoff bound _ was obtained in @xcite , for the direct part , and in @xcite , for the converse part ( both results were obtained in 2006 , see @xcite for an extensive discussion ) .",
    "those two works also essentially provided the basic tools that enabled the solution of the so called asymmetric problem in @xcite , where the set of achievable pairs of error exponents for the two hypotheses are determined .",
    "this result is often called _ hoeffding bound _ in quantum statistics .",
    "the authors in @xcite attribute the result for the classical case also to blahut @xcite and csiszr and longo @xcite . it is the author s impression , however , that the result was already known much earlier , at least among information theorists at the mit , since it is essentially used in fano s 1961 book @xcite ( even if not explicitly stated in terms of hypothesis testing ) and partially attributed to some 1957 unpublished seminar notes by shannon ( see also @xcite for an example of shannon s early familiarity with the chernoff bound ) . a more explicit formulation in terms of binary hypothesis testing is contained in @xcite in a very general form , which already considers the case of distributions with different supports ( compare with @xcite and",
    "see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.2 ) ) and also provides results for finite observation lengths and varying statistical distributions ( check for example ( * ? ? ?",
    ", pag . 524 ) ) .",
    "this is in fact what is needed in studying error exponents for hypothesis testing between different codewords of a code for a general discrete memoryless channel .    with respect to @xcite ,",
    "the main difference in the study of error exponents in binary hypothesis testing contained in @xcite and @xcite is that these papers focus more on the role of the kullback - leibler discrimination ( or relative entropy ) , which can be used as a building block for the study of the whole problem in the classical case . in @xcite , instead , a quantity equivalent to what is now known as the _ rnyi divergence _",
    "was used as the building block .",
    "the two approaches are equivalent in the classical case , and it was historically the presentation in terms of the ubiquitous kullback - leibler divergence which emerged as the preferred one as opposed to the rnyi divergence . along this same line , a simpler and elegant proof of the sphere packing bound , again in terms of the kullback - leibler divergence , was derived by haroutunian @xcite by comparing the channel under study with dummy channels with smaller capacity .",
    "this proof , which is substantially simpler than the one presented in @xcite , was then popularized in @xcite , and became the preferred proof for this result .    as a matter of fact , however , as pointed out in ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 , remark 1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.8 ) , it turns out that the solution to the study of error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing can be expressed in terms of the rnyi divergence and not in terms of the kullback - leibler divergence .",
    "thus , since the sphere packing bound is essentially based on the theory of binary hypothesis testing , it is reasonable to expect that haroutunian s approach to the sphere packing bound may fail in the quantum case .",
    "this could be in our opinion the reason why a quantum sphere packing bound has not been established in the literature .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a derivation of the sphere packing bound for classical - quantum channels by following closely the approach used in @xcite .",
    "the quantum case is related to the classical one by means of the _ nussbaum - szkoa mapping _",
    "@xcite , that represented the key point in proving the converse part of the quantum chernoff bound ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this allows us to formulate a quantum version of the shannon - gallager - berlekamp generalization of the chernoff bound ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) on binary hypothesis testing ( in the converse part ) .",
    "the proof of the sphere packing bound used in @xcite will then be adapted to obtain the equivalent bound for classical - quantum channels .",
    "this proves the power of the methods employed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mentioned generalization of the chernoff bound allows us to adapt the technique used in @xcite to find an upper bound to the reliability at @xmath21 , which leads to an exact expression when combined with the expurgated bound proved by holevo @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : basic ]",
    "we introduce the notation and the basic notions on classical and classical - quantum channels , and on the main statistical tools used in this paper . in section [ sec : umbrella ]",
    "we introduce what we call the `` umbrella bound '' for classical channels in its simplest and self - contained form .",
    "this section is entirely classical , only the _ bra - ket _",
    "notation for scalar products is used for convenience .",
    "the scope of this section is to show how lovsz idea can be extended to bound the reliability function @xmath4 at all rates larger than the lovsz theta function .",
    "interesting connections between the lovsz theta function , the cutoff rate and the expurgated bound emerge by means of this analysis .",
    "this section represents a preview of the more general results that will be derived in section [ sec : sp - umbrella ] and prepares the reader for the interpretation of lovsz representations as auxiliary channels .",
    "these results were first presented in @xcite .",
    "we then start considering bounds for classical - quantum channels . in section [ sec : quantum - h - test ]",
    "we develop a fundamental bound to the probability of error in a binary decision test between quantum states .",
    "this bound is a quantum version of the converse part of the shannon - gallager - berlekamp generalization of the chernoff bound @xcite . in section [ sec : spb ] , this tool is used to prove the sphere packing bound for classical - quantum channels .",
    "the proof of the bound follows the approach in @xcite , which contains the key idea that is also found in lovsz bound .",
    "part of the results presented in sections [ sec : quantum - h - test ] and [ sec : spb ] were first presented in @xcite . in section [ sec : inform - radii ] we provide a detailed analysis of the analogy between the sphere packing and lovsz bound . in doing so , we generalize a result of csiszr @xcite , showing that the quantum sphere packing bound can be written in terms of an information radius @xcite , which appears to be the leading theme that puts the lovsz theta function , the cutoff rate , the rate @xmath12 and the ordinary capacity @xmath0 under the same light . in this section",
    ", it is also proved that the minimum @xmath12 rate of all channels with a given confusability graph is precisely the lovsz theta function of that graph .",
    "part of these results were first presented in @xcite . in section [ sec : classical - pure ] , we provide a more detailed analysis of classical and pure - state channels , establishing a connection between the cutoff rate of a classical channel and the rate @xmath12 of a pure - state channel that could underlie the classical one .",
    "this leads as a side result to seemingly new expressions for the cutoff rate .    in section [ sec : sp - umbrella ] , then , we reconsider the umbrella bound anticipated in section [ sec : umbrella ] , giving it a more general and generally more powerful form that allows one to bound the reliability function @xmath4 of a classical - quantum channel in terms of the sphere packing bound of an auxiliary classical - quantum channel .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : zero - rate ] we consider the special case of channels with no zero - error capacity , for which we present the quantum extension of some classical bounds .",
    "in particular , we show that the zero - rate bound of @xcite can be extended to classical - quantum channels by means of the results of section [ sec : quantum - h - test ] , thus obtaining the precise value of the reliability at @xmath21",
    ". the quantum extension of some other known classical bounds is then briefly discussed .",
    "in this section , we present the choice of notation in detail while discussing the basic results on classical and classical - quantum channels , on the used divergences and on the zero - error capacity ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for more details ) .    as a general rule ,",
    "we use lower case letters for unit norm vectors ( @xmath22 etc . ) and capital letters for distributions ( @xmath23 etc . ) or density operators ( @xmath24 etc . ) .",
    "bold letters refer to quantities associated to @xmath3-fold tensor powers or products . for classical discrete memoryless channels",
    ", we use the notation @xmath25 for the probability of output @xmath26 when the input is @xmath27 .",
    "so , @xmath28 is the output distribution induced by input @xmath27 . in a similar way , for a classical - quantum channel , @xmath29 denotes the density operator associated to input @xmath27 .",
    "finally , we use dirac s _ bra - ket _",
    "notation for inner and outer products in hilbert spaces but we avoid the _ ket _ notation for vectors .",

    "@xmath95 such that @xmath91 , where @xmath96 is the identity operator .",
    "the probability that message @xmath97 is decoded when message @xmath43 is transmitted is @xmath98 .",
    "the probability of error after sending message @xmath43 is @xmath99 we then define @xmath100 , @xmath51 and @xmath4 precisely as in the classical case .",
    "a pure - state channel is one for which all density operators @xmath29 have rank one , in which case we write @xmath101 . if , on the other hand , all density operators @xmath29 commute , then they are all simultaneously diagonal in some basis . in this case",
    "it is easily proved that the optimal measurements are also diagonal in the same basis and , thus , the classical - quantum channel reduces to a classical one .",
    "each classical channel can then be thought of as a classical - quantum one with diagonal states @xmath29 , the distribution @xmath28 being the diagonal of @xmath29 .",
    "bounds to the reliability function of classical - quantum channels were first investigated by burnashev and holevo @xcite and by holevo @xcite .",
    "formal _ quantum analog of the random coding and of the expurgated exponent expressions can be written as in - and - respectively where , in this case , @xmath102 and @xmath103 operational meaning to these quantities has been given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , the random coding bound and the expurgated bound were proved for pure - state channels in @xcite , and the proof of the expurgated bound was then extended to mixed - state channels in @xcite .",
    "however , no extension of the random coding bound to mixed - state channels has been obtained yet . to the best of this author",
    "s knowledge , the best currently available lower bound to @xmath4 was obtained in @xcite .      both for the classical and for the classical - quantum cases",
    ", we can define the zero - error capacity @xmath6 of the channel according to equation . in the classical case , if a code satisfies @xmath104 , then for each pair of different codewords @xmath105 the output distributions @xmath106 and @xmath107 must have disjoint supports .",
    "this implies that , for at least one index @xmath108 , the two codewords contain in the @xmath108-th position two symbols @xmath109 and @xmath110 that are not confusable , which means that @xmath111 and @xmath112 have disjoint supports . for a given channel ,",
    "then , it is useful to define a _",
    "confusability graph _",
    "@xmath113 whose vertices are the elements of @xmath114 and whose edges are the elements @xmath115 such that @xmath27 and @xmath116 are confusable",
    ". it is then easily seen that @xmath6 only depends on the confusability graph @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , for any graph @xmath113 , we can always find a channel with confusability graph @xmath113 .",
    "thus , we may equivalently speak of the zero - error capacity of a channel or of the _ capacity @xmath117 of the graph _ @xmath113 , and we will use those two notions interchangeably through the paper .",
    "an identical discussion holds for classical - quantum channels ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion",
    ". for recent results on zero - error communication via general quantum channels , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , if a code satisfies @xmath104 , then for each @xmath118 we must have @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this is possible if and only if the signals @xmath121 and @xmath122 are orthogonal , that is @xmath123 . using the property that @xmath124 , we then have @xmath125 this implies that @xmath126 for at least one value of @xmath108 , which means that that @xmath127 and @xmath128 are not confusable .",
    "we see then that there is no difference with respect to the classical case : the zero error capacity only depends on the confusability graph .",
    "given a graph @xmath113 , we can interpret the capacity of the graph @xmath117 as either the zero error capacity @xmath6 of a classical or of a classical - quantum channel with that confusability graph .    finding the zero - error capacity remains an unsolved problem ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . as mentioned before , a first upper bound to @xmath6 was obtained by shannon by means of an argument based on feedback .",
    "he could prove that the zero - error capacity , when feedback is available , is given by the expression @xmath129\\ ] ] whenever @xmath17 .",
    "the expression above is precisely the value @xmath12 at which the sphere packing bound diverges ( whether @xmath17 or not ) .",
    "the best bound is then obtained by using the channel ( with the given confusability graph ) which minimizes the above value .",
    "a major breakthrough was obtained by lovsz in terms of his theta function @xcite .",
    "he could prove that @xmath6 is upper bounded by the quantity @xmath15 defined as @xmath130 where the outer minimum is over all sets of unit - norm vectors in any hilbert space such that @xmath131 and @xmath132 are orthogonal if symbols @xmath74 and @xmath75 can not be confused , the inner minimum is over all unit norm vectors @xmath133 , and the maximum is over all input symbols .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite for interesting comments on lovsz result .",
    "shortly afterwards , haemers @xcite , @xcite obtained another interesting upper bound to @xmath6 , which he proved to be strictly better than @xmath15 in some cases .",
    "the haemers bound asserts that @xmath6 is upper bounded by the rank of any @xmath134 matrix @xmath135 with elements @xmath136 and @xmath137 if @xmath74 and @xmath75 are non - confusable inputs .",
    "this bound is in many cases looser than lovsz one , but haemers proved it to be tighter for the graph which is the complement of the so called _",
    "schlfli graph_.    recently , an extension of the lovsz theta function for the quantum communication problem has been derived in @xcite which is based on algebraic properties satisfied by the lovsz theta function . there , the authors propose an extension for general quantum channels based on what they call _ non - commutative graphs_. in this paper , however , we always consider classical confusability graphs , and the interest is in the connection between bounds to @xmath4 and bounds to @xmath6 .",
    "further work would be needed to understand if there is a connection between the results derived here and the results of @xcite .      in this paper , a fundamental role",

    "when @xmath152 the divergence @xmath153 tends to the kullback - leibler divergence defined as @xcite @xmath154    we now introduce the corresponding quantities for the quantum case , that is , when two density operators @xmath135 and @xmath155 are to be distinguished in place of the two distributions @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",

    "finally , the rnyi divergence of order @xmath150 can be defined as @xmath172",
    "in this section , we present an upper bound to @xmath4 for classical channels that can be interpreted as an extension of lovsz work in the direction of giving at least a crude upper bound to @xmath4 for those rates that lovsz own bound proves to be strictly larger than the zero - error capacity . however , the intent is to obtain lovsz bound as a consequence of an upper bound on @xmath4 and not vice versa .",
    "the obtained bound on @xmath4 is loose at high rates , but it has two important merits .",
    "first , it makes immediately clear how lovsz idea can be extended to find an upper bound to @xmath4 that will give @xmath173 as a direct consequence .",
    "second , it reveals an important analogy between the lovsz theta function and the cutoff rate . we will in fact introduce a function @xmath174 that varies from the cutoff rate of the channel , when @xmath175 , to the lovsz theta function , when @xmath176",
    "the idea is to keep lovsz result in mind as a target but building it as the limit of a smoother construction .",
    "this construction is related to that of gallager s expurgated lower bound to @xmath4 , but it is used precisely in the opposite direction .",
    "we believe that these analogies could shed new light on the understanding of the topic and deserve further study .      in deriving the desired bound , we will start our interpretation of classical - quantum channels as auxiliary mathematical tools for the study of classical channels .",
    "contrarily to what may be considered the most traditional approach , however , in this section we do not interpret our channel s transition probabilities as the eigenvalues of positive semidefinite commuting operators .",
    "we consider instead the transition probabilities as the squared absolute values of the components of some wave functions , and it is thus more instructive to initially consider only pure - state channels . in this direction , we also need to recall briefly some important connections between the reliability function @xmath4 and the bhattacharyya distance between codewords .",
    "this connection is of great importance since the bhattacharyya distance between distributions is related to a scalar product between unit norm vectors in a hilbert space .",
    "it is this property that makes an adaptation of lovsz approach to study the function @xmath4 possible .    for a generic input symbol @xmath74 ,",
    "consider the unit norm vector @xmath177 of the square roots of the conditional probabilities of the output symbols given input @xmath74 .",
    "we call this the _ state vector _ of input symbol @xmath74 , in obvious analogy with the input signals of pure - state classical - quantum channels",
    ". we will also use the simplified notation @xmath178 .",

    "we call this vector the _ state vector _ of the input sequence @xmath37 , again in analogy with classical - quantum channels .",
    "let for simplicity @xmath184 be the state vector of the codeword @xmath44 ; then we can represent our code @xmath185 by means of its associated state vectors @xmath186 . since all square roots are taken positive , note that our classical channel has a positive zero - error capacity if and only if there are at least two state vectors @xmath187 , @xmath188 such that @xmath189 .",
    "this implies that codes can be built such that @xmath190 for some @xmath43 , @xmath97 , that is , the two codewords @xmath43 and @xmath97 can not be confused at the output .    however , the scalar product @xmath191 plays a more general role , since it is related to the so called bhattacharyya distance between the two codewords @xmath43 and @xmath97 .",
    "in particular , in a binary hypothesis testing between codewords @xmath43 and @xmath97 , an extension of the chernoff bound allows to assert that the minimum error probability @xmath1 vanishes exponentially fast in the block length @xmath3 and that @xcite @xmath192 using , we then see that @xmath193 we add as a comment that equality holds on the left for the class of channels , introduced in @xcite , called _ pairwise reversible _ channels .",
    "these channels are such that for any pair of inputs @xmath74 , @xmath75 the quantity @xmath194 is minimized by @xmath195 , which implies that @xmath196 for any pair of inputs @xmath74 , @xmath75 . for any channel , for a given code ,",
    "the probability of error @xmath100 is lower bounded by the probability of error in each binary hypothesis test between two codewords .",

    ", we want something more , that is , to find a lower bound on @xmath201 for each code with rate @xmath202 , so as to deduce an upper bound on @xmath4 for all @xmath202 .",

    "set now @xmath222 and for an input sequence @xmath34 call , in analogy with , @xmath223 .",
    "observe that we have @xmath224 this is the key step which is central to both lovsz approach and to the sphere packing bound : the construction of an auxiliary state which is `` close '' to all possible states associated to any sequence . in this case the states are close in terms of scalar product , while in the sphere packing bound they will be close in terms of the more general rnyi divergence .",
    "the basic idea , however , is not different .",
    "let us first check how lovsz bound is obtained .",
    "lovsz approach is to bound the number @xmath39 of codewords with orthogonal state vectors , using the property that if @xmath225 form an orthonormal set , then @xmath226 hence , if @xmath227 , there are at least two non - orthogonal vectors in the set , say @xmath228 . but",
    "this implies that @xmath229 .",
    "hence , if @xmath230 , no zero - error code can exist .",
    "we still have the free choice of @xmath209 , and it is obvious that larger values of @xmath209 can only give better results .",
    "it is then preferable to simply work in the limit of @xmath231 and thus build the representation @xmath232 under the only constraint that @xmath233 whenever @xmath234 .",
    "this gives precisely lovsz result .",
    "now , instead of bounding @xmath5 under the hypothesis of zero - error communication , we want to bound the probability of error for a given @xmath230 . considering the tilted state vectors of the code , we can rewrite equation as @xmath235 the second expression above has the benefit of easily allowing to average it over different codewords .",
    "so , we can average this expression over all @xmath43 and , defining the matrix @xmath236 , we get @xmath237 since @xmath238 is a unit norm vector , this implies that the matrix @xmath239 has at least one eigenvalue larger than or equal to @xmath240 .",
    "this in turn implies that also the matrix @xmath241 has itself an eigenvalue larger than or equal to @xmath240 , that is @xmath242 it is known that for a given matrix @xmath135 with elements @xmath243 , the following inequality holds @xmath244 using this inequality with @xmath245 we get @xmath246 where the last step is due to the jensen inequality , since @xmath204 . extracting the sum from this inequality we obtain the inequality stated in the theorem .    to prove the corollary ,",
    "simply note that @xmath247 the bound is trivial if @xmath248 .",
    "if @xmath230 , we deduce again lovsz result that there are two non - orthogonal codewords .",
    "but now we also have some further information ; for @xmath230 , the second term in the parenthesis decreases exponentially faster than the first , which leads us to the conclusion that @xmath249 the bounds in terms of @xmath4 are then obtained by simply taking the limit @xmath53 and using the bounds and .    in passing from the theorem to the corollary , we have essentially substituted the _ maximum _",
    "bhattacharyya distance between codewords for the largest _ average _ distance from one codeword to the remaining ones .",
    "the reason for doing this is that we are unable to bound @xmath4 efficiently in terms of the _ sum _ of the distances , although intuition suggests that it should be possible to do it , in consideration of the behavior of @xmath4 near the critical rate .",
    "this is related to the tightness of the union bound ; it is our firm belief that this step is crucial and that improvements in this sense could give important enhancements in the resulting bound .",
    "a comment about the computation of this bound is in order .",
    "there is no essential difference between the evaluation of @xmath174 and the evaluation of @xmath15 .",
    "the optimal representation @xmath208 , for any fixed @xmath209 , can be obtained by solving a semidefinite optimization problem .",
    "if we consider the @xmath250 gram matrix @xmath251^t[\\tilde{\\psi}_1,\\ldots,\\tilde{\\psi}_{|{{\\mathcal{x}}}| } , f]\\ ] ] we note that finding the optimal representation amounts to solving the problem @xmath252 the solution to this problem is @xmath253 , and both the optimal representation vectors @xmath208 and the handle @xmath213 can be obtained by means of the spectral decomposition of the optimal @xmath113 found .",
    "we now study the behaviour of @xmath174 for different values of @xmath209 . a first important",
    "comment is about the result obtained for @xmath175 ; the value @xmath254 is simply the cutoff rate of the channel . indeed , for @xmath175 , we can without loss of generality use the obvious representation @xmath255 , since any different optimal representation will simply be a rotation of this ( or an equivalent description in a space with a different dimension ) . in this case , all the components of all the vectors @xmath208 are non - negative , and this easily implies that the optimal @xmath213 can as well be chosen with non - negative components , since changing a supposedly negative component of @xmath213 to its absolute value can only improve the result .",
    "thus , @xmath213 can be written as the square root of a probability density @xmath256 on @xmath257 and we have @xmath258 where the minimum is now over all probability distribution @xmath256 on the output alphabet @xmath257 . as observed by csiszr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 , with @xmath259 ) , this expression equals the cutoff rate for the cutoff rate , instead of the more common @xmath260 , for notational needs that will become clear in section [ sec : inform - radii ] .",

    "we will see that it represents a nice connection between a classical channel and a pure - state classical - quantum channel possibly underlying the classical one .",
    "another important characteristic of the function @xmath174 is observed in the limit @xmath176 . in the limit",
    ", the only constraint on representations is that @xmath233 whenever @xmath234 .",
    "hence , when @xmath176 , the set of possible representations is precisely the same considered by lovsz @xcite , and we thus have @xmath264 as @xmath231 .",
    "so , the value of @xmath174 moves from the cutoff rate to the lovsz theta function when @xmath209 varies from @xmath265 to @xmath266 .",
    "this clearly implies that our bound to @xmath4 is finite for all @xmath202 and thus lovsz bound @xmath267    in order to understand what happens for values of @xmath209 between 1 and @xmath266 , it is instructive to consider first a class of channels introduced by jelinek @xcite and later also studied by blahut @xcite .",
    "these are channels for which the @xmath134 matrix @xmath268 with @xmath269 element @xmath270 is positive semidefinite for all @xmath204 .",
    "it was proved by jelinek that , for these channels , the expurgated bound of gallager @xcite is invariant over @xmath3-fold extensions of the channel , that is , it has the same form when computed on a single channel use or on multiple channel uses ( this is not true in general ) .",
    "thus , if the conjecture made in ( * ? ? ?",
    "77 ) , that the expurgated bound computed on the @xmath3-fold channel is tight asymptotically when @xmath271 , is true , then for these channels the reliability would be known exactly since it would equal the expurgated bound for the single use channel .",
    "it is also known that for these channels , the inputs can be partitioned in subsets such that all pairs of symbols from the same subset are confusable and no pair of symbols from different subsets are confusable .",
    "the zero error capacity in this case is simply the logarithm of the number of such subsets . for these channels , since the matrix @xmath268 is positive semidefinite , there exists a set of vectors @xmath272 such that @xmath273 , that is , for all @xmath274 , representations of degree @xmath209 exist that satisfy all the constraints with equality . in this case , the equivalence with the cutoff rate that we have seen for @xmath175 can be in a sense extended to other @xmath209 values .",
    "we will in fact see in section [ sec : classical - pure ] that we can write @xmath275\\\\    & =   \\max_{p}\\left[- \\log \\sum_{{{x}},{{x'}}}p({{x}})p({{x ' } } ) { \\langle { \\psi}_{{x}}|{\\psi}_{{x'}}\\rangle}^{1/\\rho}\\label{eq : alt_def_theta2}\\right]\\\\ & = \\max_{p } \\frac{{e_{\\text{x}}}(\\rho , p)}{\\rho},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in the last step , we have used . hence ,",

    "hence , our bound is obtained by drawing the curve parameterized as @xmath281 in the @xmath282 plane .",
    "this automatically implies that we obtain the bound @xmath283 which gives the precise value of the zero - error capacity in this case ( which is however trivial ) and , if @xmath78 , the bound @xmath284 if the channel is pairwise reversible , this can then be improved to @xmath285 , which is obviously tight .    for general channels with a non - trivial zero - error capacity , like for example any channel",

    "it was proved by holevo @xcite that for such a set of states , there exists a measurement with probability of error for the @xmath43-th message bounded as @xmath677 this implies that @xmath678 hence , asymptotically in the block length @xmath3 , we find that @xmath679 and hence @xmath680 considering the original states @xmath681 , we deduce that , @xmath682    we now anticipate some notions that will be discussed in more detail in section [ sec : zero - rate ] for expository convenience , since they play a central role also in other low rate bounds to @xmath4 .",

    "for example , if the original channel is a pairwise reversible classical channel , then we can use the relation @xmath686 , which holds in that case , and thus state @xmath687 in general , however , it would be better to change the definition of @xmath210 in order to take into account these types of particular cases .",
    "we have not yet investigated the topic in this direction and we thus only focus on the general case .    clearly , for any rate @xmath5 , the parameter @xmath209 and the auxiliary channel @xmath667 can be chosen optimally .",
    "we thus have the following result .",
    "the reliability function @xmath4 is upper bounded by the function @xmath688 , where @xmath689    a precise evaluation of this bound is not trivial . for a given @xmath5",
    ", one should find the optimal pair @xmath690 and this is in general a complex task , which gives rise to interesting optimization problems .",
    "a complete treatment of this topic is still under investigation and will hopefully be detailed in a future work .",
    "it is important , however , to consider here the particular case of the bound used for classical channels by means of pure - state channels , in order to complete our interpretation of the umbrella bound given in section [ sec : umbrella ] as a special case of this one .",
    "suppose the states @xmath84 commute , which means that the original channel is a classical one , and assume that we restrict the set of possible admissible auxiliary channels to the pure - state ones .",
    "first observe that for commuting states @xmath84 we have @xmath691 while , for pure states @xmath692 , we have @xmath693 .",
    "hence , for a classical channel , the restriction of @xmath210 to pure state channels precisely corresponds to the set of admissible representations of degree @xmath209 in the sense of section [ sec : umbrella - umbrella ] .",
    "then , for a fixed @xmath209 and for a fixed auxiliary channel , it is interesting to study the values of @xmath5 for which the bound is finite .",
    "this happens for rates @xmath5 larger than the rate @xmath694 where @xmath672 diverges and , from our previous analysis , we have @xmath695 we see that this is almost the same expression of the value of the representation @xmath696 , and it is precisely the same value if @xmath697 , @xmath291 , as proved in theorem [ th : rinftyv ]",
    ".    it would be interesting to evaluate @xmath698 but , as mentioned in the previous section , this is not easy in general . by theorem",

    "this implies that for @xmath700 , the right hand side of equation is not larger than @xmath701 .",
    "exploiting the fact that @xmath4 is surely non - increasing , we then deduce the bound @xmath702 which is to be compared with with @xmath694 in place of @xmath174 .",
    "considering the expression for @xmath12 , and optimizing over the pure - state auxiliary channels , we thus see that the umbrella bound derived in section [ sec : umbrella ] is included as a particular case of the more general one derived in this section . in general , however , for a given representation , @xmath698 can be strictly smaller than @xmath694 . furthermore , the function @xmath10 has in many cases slope @xmath703 in @xmath12 and thus the bound of equation , for a given @xmath5 , is in those cases not optimized for the value of @xmath209 which leads to @xmath704 , but for a larger one , which leads to @xmath705 , whenever possible .",
    "this implies that the bound derived here is in general strictly better than that derived in section [ sec : umbrella ] .",
    "we close this section by pointing out that , as a consequence of theorem [ th : schrijver ] , the smallest value of @xmath5 for which @xmath688 is finite is precisely the lovsz theta function .",

    ", it is infinite over a non - empty range of positive small rates for all non trivial pure - state channels , even if there is no pair of orthogonal input states , which implies that the zero - error capacity of the channel is zero . in this section ,",
    "we deal precisely with channels with no zero - error capacity . for these channels , in the classical case some bounds that greatly improve the sphere packing bound were derived .",
    "the main objective of this section is to consider some possible extensions of these results to the classical - quantum case .",
    "a first interesting result that extends a low rate bound from the classical to the classical - quantum setting was already obtained in @xcite for the case of pure - state channels .",
    "there , the authors proved the equivalent of the zero - rate upper bound to @xmath4 derived in @xcite for the case of pure - state channels with no zero - error capacity , thus proving that even in this case the expurgated bound is tight at zero rate . for general classical - quantum channels ,",
    "a similar result was attempted in @xcite , but the obtained upper bound to @xmath4 at zero - rate does not coincide with the limiting value of the expurgated bound in this case .    in this section ,",
    "we first present the extension of the zero - rate upper bound of @xcite , @xcite to the case of mixed - state channels , which leads to the determination of the exact value of the reliability function at zero - rate .",
    "then , we also discuss some other bounds .",
    "in particular , we consider the application of blahut s bound @xcite to the case of pure- and mixed - state channels .    a recurring theme in the study of the reliability of classical and classical - quantum channels is the fact that , at low rates , the probability of error is dominated by the worst pair of codewords in the code . at high rates , it is important to bound the probability of a message to be incorrectly decoded due to a bulk of competitors .",
    "the auxiliary state @xmath386 used in the proof of the sphere packing bound serves precisely to this scope and represents this bulk of competitors . at low rates , instead",
    ", there are essentially only few competitors ( we may conjecture just one ) which are responsible for almost all the probability of error .",
    "thus , in the low rate region , it is important to bound the probability of error in a binary decision between any pair of codewords . for this reason ,",

    "theorem [ th : quantum - codewords ] implies that the results on the zero - rate reliability of ( * ? ? ?",

    "these results are related to an upper bound to the reliability function in the low rate region derived by blahut @xcite and to upper bounds derived for the classical - quantum case in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a clarification of these relations is the objective of the next part of this section .    in view of that , it is useful to remind here the relation between the chernoff , the bhattacharyya and the fidelity distances .",

    "the proof of berlekamp s bound and for general classical and classical - quantum channels , respectively , is instead more complicated ( see the proof of ( * ? ? ?",

    "this procedure does not apply directly since the optimal measurements are in general entangled and are not equivalent to separable measurements .",

    "fano s proof , however , was not competely rigorous , although it was correct with respect to the elaboration of the many complicated and `` subtle '' equations that allowed him to obtain the resulting expression for the first time .",
    "fano s approach already contained the main idea of considering a binary hypothesis test between some appropriately chosen codewords and a dummy output distribution , and his procedure allowed him to solve the resulting minmax optimization problem with a direct approach which , in this author s opinion , could be defined `` tedious '' but not `` unenlightening '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "91 ) , and which opened in any case the way that allowed to subsequently obtain the formal proof later on .",
    "it is not easy to precisely understand , from the published papers , when the formal proof was subsequently obtained and by whom .",
    "in fact , even if it was first published in the mentioned 1967 paper @xcite , the result must have been somehow accepted before , at least at the mit , since berlekamp mentions the bound and the main properties of the function @xmath10 in an overview of the known results on the reliability function in his 1964 phd thesis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 1 : _ historical backgound _ ) , with references only to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite `` and others '' .",
    "gallager , as well , mentions the bound in his 1965 paper @xcite attributing the `` statement '' of the bound to fano ( see section i and eq . ( 44 ) therein ) .",
    "note also that fano and gallager do _ not _ call it `` sphere packing bound '' while berlekamp does in his thesis .",
    "it is worth pointing out that many results were not published by their authors at that time , as happened for example with the elias bound for the minimum distance of binary codes , which is described in @xcite .",
    "analogously , in the introduction to ( * ? ? ?",
    "9 ) , fano credits shannon for previous derivation , in some unpublished notes , of parts of the results therein . it is known that shannon was still very productive during the 60s @xcite and had many unpublished results on discrete memoryless channels @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not immediately clear which parts of the ideas used in the proof of the sphere packing bound were already known among mit s information theorists .",
    "furthermore even if the resulting expression was stated first by fano , finding the rigorous proof required a reconsideration of elias original work for the binary case @xcite .",
    "finally , an important comment concerns the bound for constant composition codes with non - optimal composition .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , while fano s version of the sphere packing bound includes the correct tight expression for the case of fixed composition codes with general non - optimal composition @xcite , the version given in @xcite does not consider this case , and the bound is tight only for the optimal composition .",
    "the reader may also note that it is not even possible to simply remove the optimization over @xmath391 in that bound , using @xmath600 in place of @xmath799 , since it can be proved that constant composition codes with non optimal composition @xmath391 achieve an exponent strictly larger than @xmath600 at those rates where the maximizing @xmath209 in the definition of @xmath10 is less than one @xcite .",
