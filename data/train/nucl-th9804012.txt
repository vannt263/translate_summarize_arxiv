    "the purpose of the method discussed is to solve reaction problems with bound state calculation techniques .",
    "the approach can be applied to both perturbation and strong interaction induced inclusive and exclusive processes . below the case of inclusive perturbation induced reactions",
    "is considered .",
    "the general procedure was introduced in 1985 @xcite .",
    "the originally proposed stieltjes transform led to stability problems @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that a lorentzian kernel allowed to cure the instabilities .",
    "accurate results on three- and four - nucleon response functions were obtained with this kernel @xcite .    in sec .",
    "2 the procedure is outlined . in sec .",
    "3 the stability issue is explained and the inversion technique is described . in sec .",
    "4 the choice of the transform kernel is discussed . in sec .",
    "5 the accuracy of the method in the `` exactly solvable '' @xmath0 problem is demonstrated , and its features in the calculations of the three- and four - nucleon response functions are discussed .",
    "we need to obtain the response functions of the form @xmath1 starting from a few  body hamiltonian . here",
    "@xmath2 is the excitation energy , @xmath3 is the ground state wave function , @xmath4 is a complete set of the final state wave functions , and @xmath5 is a transition operator . in general the continuum wave functions @xmath4 include infinite numbers of various channels with three or more fragments .",
    "the number of these functions is infinite as well",
    ". therefore the calculation of @xmath6 via direct use of eq .",
    "( 1 ) would in general be impractical .",
    "complications may occur even at very low energy due to the coulomb interaction in channels with more than two fragments .",
    "the present method circumvents the above problems due to the fact that the continuum wave functions @xmath4 do not enter the calculation at all .",
    "the method proceeds in two steps . at the first step an integral transform of @xmath6 with a smooth kernel @xmath7 @xmath8",
    "is calculated instead of @xmath6 itself . using sum ",
    "rule techniques one can see that @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the hamiltonian and the ground state energy , respectively . expression ( 3 ) is evaluated with _ bound ",
    "state techniques _ as described below . as a second step eq .",
    "( 2 ) is considered as an integral equation to invert and thus one gets @xmath12 from @xmath13 .",
    "let us suppose that the transform ( 3 ) is evaluated and consider the subsequent inversion of eq .",
    "as it is known solutions to such type of equations are unstable with respect to high frequency oscillations .",
    "indeed , let us add an oscillating increment @xmath14 to the right  hand side of eq .",
    "the transform will get the increment @xmath15 , and if the oscillations are rapid enough @xmath15 may be small even if the oscillation amplitudes are not small .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 might become less than possible errors in the numerical calculation of the transform and the corresponding rapidly oscillating increment @xmath14 could not then be discriminated .",
    "it is known that a regularization procedure can cure the instability .",
    "the mathematical justification of such procedures can be found e.g. in ref .",
    "the regularization suppresses rapid oscillations .",
    "the higher an accuracy in @xmath16 is the higher might be the frequency level at which the suppression occurs and the finer are the details of a true response that can be reproduced with an approximate solution . a stability of the solution with respect to changes in the regularization parameter",
    "would then indicate that the high frequencies suppressed are insignificant for reproducing a response .",
    "the inversion procedure in the calculations @xcite was the following .",
    "the response was sought for in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 are known functions including nonlinear parameters @xmath19 . if one substitutes this form into the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) one has @xmath20 where the @xmath21 are the transformed basis functions .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath19 are obtained fitting the transform of eq .",
    "( 5 ) to the known results obtained by eq . ( 3 ) at many @xmath23 points .",
    "the number of functions @xmath24 plays the role of the regularization parameter and is chosen within the above mentioned stability region .",
    "features of a response known beforehand such as its low energy behavior and possible information on narrow levels could easily be incorporated into the set @xmath25 .",
    "this increases the accuracy of the inversion .",
    "the longitudinal @xmath26 few  body responses behave in a rather peculiar way at small @xmath2 .",
    "this is caused by the fact that lower multipole contributions to the continuum part of the responses can have maxima in the threshold region , while higher multipoles exhibit maxima only in the quasielastic peak region .",
    "we applied the method separately to those lower multipole responses and to the sum of all others retained @xcite .",
    "this substantially increased the accuracy of the results at low energy .",
    "the reason is that for simple functions @xmath18 one can better describe the behavior of those pieces of the response function with sufficiently low @xmath24 values in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) than the total response function .",
    "at a given accuracy in the transform @xmath16 the resulting response @xmath6 will be most accurate if the kernel is chosen as `` narrow '' as possible .",
    "indeed , only changes in @xmath6 occurring at the intervals @xmath27 smaller than the range of the kernel may be hard to resolve since they may tend to cancel at integrating in eq .",
    "the following choice proved to be efficient @xcite .",
    "let the transform variable @xmath23 be complex and consider the kernel of the lorentz form @xmath28 } ,      \\label{eq : ker}\\ ] ] @xmath29 being `` sufficiently small '' . according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) this leads to the transform @xmath30 eq .",
    "( [ eq : lor ] ) can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the unique solution to the schrdinger  like equation with a _ source _ , @xmath33 since @xmath16 and thus @xmath34 does exists , @xmath32 is localized ! hence bound ",
    "state type methods can be applied to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : equ ] ) .",
    "the accuracy of the method was tested with the two  body longitudinal @xmath35 response .",
    "to approach the situation with a=3 and 4 , several percent errors were _ artificially _ introduced into the transform , see @xcite .",
    "1 demonstrates that even in presence of the errors the response obtained practically coincides with the exact one calculated in the conventional way .",
    "longitudinal @xmath26 response functions @xcite and total photoabsorption cross sections @xcite were studied for three- and four - nucleon cases . in @xcite reid and bonn realistic nn forces were employed .",
    "( [ eq : equ ] ) was cast into the form of inhomogeneous faddeev  type equations . in @xcite",
    "local nn ( malfliet  tjon type ) potentials reproducing @xmath36wave nn phase shifts up to the pion threshold were used .",
    "( [ eq : equ ] ) was solved with the help of the jastrow correlated hyperspherical harmonic basis ( chh ) .",
    "the @xmath29 values were taken from the interval 5 mev@xmath37 20 mev .",
    "the smaller @xmath29 the more accurate is the inversion but the larger is the number of chh basis functions required to achieve the same accuracy in the transform .",
    "in fact for @xmath29 tending to zero the scattering regime is recovered .",
    "in other problems , such as the response of the @xmath38li nucleus in the 3cluster model much lower @xmath29 values can easily be used . for an efficient inversion",
    "the transform should be obtained in the @xmath39 region covering the interval of @xmath2 values of interest . besides @xmath40 ,",
    "the choice @xmath41 is possible . in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath29 values were taken to increase with @xmath39 .",
    "this improved the accuracy in @xmath6 at low energy .    to judge",
    "the quality of the responses obtained the following criteria were applied .",
    "first , the input transform should be obtained from the dynamic equation ( [ eq : equ ] ) with a sufficient accuracy .",
    "a typical trend of convergence is demonstrated in fig .",
    "2 . the quantity @xmath42 governs the number of the chh basis functions retained at solving eq . ( [ eq : equ ] ) .",
    "the @xmath42 values in fig . 2 are sufficient to provide an accurate response and they are substantially lower than those required in the bound ",
    "state calculation with the same nn potential .",
    "second , as said above , the responses obtained should be stable with respect to a change in @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) in some @xmath43 interval .",
    "this is the most important criterion . in the harder 4-nucleon calculations we had @xmath44 . in some easier cases the @xmath43 values were much larger .",
    "third , various choices of @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ker ] ) and sets @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) should lead to approximately the same responses provided that the above mentioned criterion is fulfilled , and this also tested in our calculations as well .",
    "an additional check is provided by sum rules .",
    "the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath46 were compared with the sum rule expressions evaluated independently .",
    "the differences were about 1% or less for the non  energy weighted and less than 2% for the energy ",
