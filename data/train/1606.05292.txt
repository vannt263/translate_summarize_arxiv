    "young and massive star clusters are ideal for studying the high - mass imf since they still include bright intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath3 ) . however , the vast majority of these stars that were ever born in the local galaxy group are now white dwarfs .",
    "while these faint remnants can not be observed to the same distances as their progenitors , the field white dwarf mass distribution could still provide information about the imf of local populations , such as the galactic disk and halo .",
    "current white dwarf samples are small for galactic halo studies but _ gaia _ @xcite and _ euclid _ @xcite will soon present unprecedented opportunities .",

    "however , difficulties in the interpretation of the sdss mass distribution arise from significant spectroscopic selection biases as a function of colour and magnitude @xcite . the local 20  pc sample @xcite offers a better completeness but is limited to @xmath5120 objects . in all cases ,",
    "multiple astrophysical effects have to be considered when attempting to comprehend field white dwarf masses , such as the sfh , imf , ifmr , and binary evolution .",
    "nevertheless , a few attempts have been made at understanding features in the observed white dwarf mass distributions @xcite . in the recent years",

    "the initial goal of this study was to constrain the imf from white dwarf mass distributions drawn from the 20  pc and sdss samples .",

    "we present instead a systematic review of the uncertainties that come into play when interpreting white dwarf mass distributions . our investigation will help to comprehend the larger _ gaia _ sample that will soon provide precise individual luminosities for almost all known white dwarfs @xcite . by combining parallaxes with spectroscopic or photometric temperatures and a mass - radius relation ,",
    "we will obtain precise masses independently from current spectroscopic surface gravity measurements .",

    "we explore the modelling of both the observed 20  pc and sdss mass distributions .",
    "since the white dwarfs studied in this work are restricted to distances below @xmath5500 pc , we made no attempt at a full scale model of the galaxy .",
    "the assumptions behind our simulations are fairly similar to those employed in recent studies of white dwarf luminosity functions and kinematics @xcite . as a consequence ,",

    "these models have c / o cores ( 50/50 by mass fraction mixed uniformly ) and assume thick hydrogen layers ( @xmath12 = 10@xmath13 ) for h - atmosphere white dwarfs and thin layers ( @xmath14 = 10@xmath15 ) for helium and mixed atmospheres .",

    "[ fg : f1 ] .",
    "we remind the reader that by restricting the selected stars to @xmath16 the mean mass value is biased towards a higher value than those reported in other studies .",
    "this sample is estimated to be 80 - 90% volume - complete @xcite . at zeroth order",
    ", the mass of a white dwarf is expected to have little dependence on the volume in which it is located .",
    "however , we discuss in section  4 that biases owing to variable sfh and velocity dispersion ( as a function of age and mass ) have a significant impact on the interpretation of the observed mass distribution .",
    "we also pay special attention to the fact that the 10 - 20% missing objects could preferentially be lower luminosity , hence massive white dwarfs .",
    "we note that owing to the photometric technique which has little sensitivity to the atmospheric composition , this sample has precise masses for all spectral types , including da , db , dc , dq , and dz white dwarfs .",
    "this also includes magnetic objects accounting for 15% of the sample , which should be regarded as a lower limit given that many local white dwarfs have not been adequately observed for polarisation and many of them are too cool to show zeeman splitting .",

    "we neglect low - mass objects ( red ; @xmath17 ) for the computation of the mean masses and mass dispersions , which are labeled on the panel .",
    "this should taken into account when comparing to other studies that do not restrict mass values .",
    "[ fg : f1 ] ]      we also rely on the sdss white dwarf sample , which is largely magnitude - limited but has a complex spectroscopic completeness that varies from 10 to 90% as a function of magnitude and colour @xcite .",
    "the other major difference with the 20  pc sample is that no parallaxes are available for the vast majority of sdss white dwarfs . for da and db white dwarfs , which represent roughly 85% of the sdss sample @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to employ the spectroscopic method combined with evolutionary sequences to determine the masses to a high precision @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is not straightforward to determine masses for other spectral types , in particular magnetic da white dwarfs .",
    "the resulting bias on the mass distribution could be important , since magnetic degenerates are thought to be more massive than the average @xcite .",
    "we base our analysis on the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) spectroscopic sample of @xcite , where we have carefully refitted all das with 1d ml2/@xmath18 = 0.8 model atmospheres @xcite , applied 3d corrections @xcite , and re - assigned the different subtypes based on a careful visual identification .",
    "we have employed sdss spectra with the data reduction from dr10 . as for the 20  pc sample",
    ", we have employed evolutionary models from @xcite to constrain masses .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that a cutoff at s / n @xmath5 15 was an optimal separation between the size of the sample and the uncertainties in the mass distribution , and we use a corresponding cutoff at @xmath19 .",
    "the full results of our alternative analysis are outside the scope of this work , and in fig .",
    "[ fg : f2 ] we simply compare our mass distribution with that of @xcite .",
    "we restrict the comparison to single non - magnetic das ( @xmath17 ) and we note that the identification of subtypes differs between the two studies .",
    "we find a moderate offset of 0.015 @xmath7 in the mean mass .",
    "furthermore , our identification of subtypes is significantly different , especially for magnetic white dwarfs and da+dc double degenerates , which can result in spurious high @xmath20 values if incorrectly identified .",
    "for instance , we find a magnetic fraction of 2.5% compared to 4.4%-5.3% for @xcite , with their upper estimate based on uncertain detections .",
    "our recovered fraction is admittedly small , 6 times less than for the 20  pc sample discussed above , and we have no explanation for this behaviour .",
    "the true magnetic incidence in the sdss is expected to be slightly larger given the low average signal - to - noise of the spectroscopic observations , but this can not account for the full difference .",
    "we are aware that larger and more recent sdss samples have since been identified , though until the discrepancy with the identification of subtypes has been resolved , we prefer to rely on our own sample .",
    "furthermore , our study below is limited by biases rather than number statistics , hence it was deemed unnecessary to build a larger sample .    .",
    "the identification of subtypes differs between the two studies , hence we renormalise the @xcite distribution of 2903 single non - magnetic das to the 2998 such objects identified in this work .",
    "we neglect low - mass objects ( red ; @xmath17 ) for the computation of the mean masses and mass dispersions .",

    "k , helium - rich dc , dq , and dz white dwarfs become present in significant numbers , and for @xmath22 k , dbs have uncertain spectroscopic parameters @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "we restrict our study to higher temperatures where the large majority of sdss white dwarfs have precise atmospheric parameters and are either of the da , db , or dba spectral type .",
    "furthermore , the spectroscopic completeness of the sdss catalog varies significantly as a function of colour and magnitude . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we have decided to restrict our analysis of the mass distribution to objects with @xmath23 ( k ) @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to cooling ages in the range @xmath26 ( gyr ) @xmath27 .",
    "we demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ fg : f3 ] that the completeness can be approximated as constant within that range .",
    "we base our calculations on the results of @xcite who have determined the probability of sdss dr10 photometric sources of being white dwarfs based on colours and proper - motion .",
    "we have converted the observed colours into atmospheric parameters for da white dwarfs , and we define the completeness as the fraction of objects with a spectrum among those that have a probability of 41% or larger of being a white dwarf .",
    "we note that the spectroscopic completeness appears to decrease slightly for higher masses , though one should be cautious about this result since we do not account for possible photometric calibration offsets , reddening , and a confirmation that objects without a spectrum are actually stellar remnants .",
    "we remind the reader that fig .",
    "[ fg : f3 ] refers to the spectroscopic completeness for a magnitude - limited sample , and not the volume completeness , which will be taken into account in our simulations in section 3 .",
    "db white dwarfs span a similarly located but much smaller colour space in that @xmath11 range , hence we assume that the completeness is the same as for das .",
    "we concur with @xcite that spectroscopic completeness corrections do not necessarily have a large effect on the relative mass distribution .    fig .",

    "we also observe that the addition of db white dwarfs ( bottom panel ) leads to a slightly smaller mean mass and mass dispersion .",

    "we present our standard model for the 20  pc ( @xmath31 ) and sdss ( @xmath30 ) samples , and defer the lengthy discussion about biases and alternative assumptions to section  4 .",
    "we use a simple galactic model with a thin disk that was formed 10 gyr ago , a constant star formation history ( sfh ) , and a salpeter initial mass function ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ) .",
    "we assume a uniform distribution in galactic coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 , corresponding to the plane of the disk .",
    "this crude galactic model is a reasonable assumption given that all of our targets are within a distance of 500  pc .",
    "we suppose that radial migration within the disk has no net effect on the white dwarf mass distribution , which is also a consequence of assuming a uniform distribution in the plane of the disk .",
    "we employ a variable scale height in the vertical direction @xmath36 as a function of total stellar age , the sum of the white dwarf cooling age and the main - sequence lifetime .",
    "we suppose that the vertical scale height is directly proportional to the observed vertical velocity dispersion @xmath37 , as in the isothermal sheet galactic disk model @xcite .",
    "we use the empirical velocity dispersion versus total age relation from @xcite    @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a constant and the total stellar age in gyr .",
    "we have chosen the constant so that the vertical scale height is 75  pc at 1  gyr based on the velocity of young massive sdss white dwarfs @xcite and the scale height distribution of young open clusters @xcite .",
    "the vertical scale height thus reaches a maximum value of @xmath5200  pc at 5 gyr and thereafter remains constant according to eqs .  1 - 2 .",
    "since white dwarfs have a quite limited mass range , we do not consider a variation with mass .",
    "furthermore , our samples are centered 20  pc above the plane of the disk , which is the approximate position of the sun .",
    "the first step of our monte carlo simulations is to have a star formed at a random time in the last 10  gyr , a random mass weighted by the salpeter imf , and a random location within 500  pc weighted by the exponential distribution in the vertical direction .",
    "we then derive the main - sequence lifetime for solar metallicity from @xcite , and subtract it to the formation time to obtain the white dwarf cooling age . if the cooling age is positive , we then obtain the white dwarf cooling age .",
    "if the cooling age is positive , we then find the white dwarf mass using an ifmr drawn from @xcite supplemented by low - mass data ( @xmath41 ) adapted from @xcite .",

    "finally , biases owing to binary populations and incompleteness directly impact the mass distributions , while @xcite have demonstrated that it does not lead to significant systematic effects on the sfh .",
    "we find that our simulations overpredict the fraction of massive white dwarfs by a factor of @xmath51.5 for both the 20  pc and sdss samples .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with earlier monte carlo simulations of similar populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this result suggests a single star imf that is significantly steeper than salpeter for the galactic disk .",
    "however , if we account for all uncertainties , a salpeter imf is not ruled out .",
    "we note that this result differs from the common view that there is an observed excess of massive white dwarfs when representing the peak in the mass distributions with a gaussian function ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we do not challenge this fact but only the astrophysical interpretation .",
    "our calculations suggest that gaussian functions are a poor substitute to realistic simulations including stellar and galactic evolution when attempting to understand the nature of high - mass white dwarfs .",
    "_ gaia _ will soon provide precise parallaxes for all white dwarfs studied in this work .",
    "this will supply precise independent masses leading to a better understanding of the observed mass distributions .",
    "_ gaia _ will also provide a much better picture of the completeness of the samples .",
    "for the sdss sample in particular , this includes the identification of double degenerates and the determination of precise masses for all subtypes including magnetic white dwarfs . by identifying a much larger 40  pc sample with the help of _ gaia _ and spectroscopic follow - ups",
    ", it will be possible to improve our understanding of the local sfh and kinematics as a function of age and mass .",
    "for instance , it will be possible to study the mass distribution for subsamples in total age , reducing the uncertainties due to galactic evolution effects .",
    "nevertheless , it could remain a challenge to disentangle the effects from the imf and ifmr on the mass distribution even with the _ gaia _ data , although many more white dwarfs in clusters and common proper motion pairs will be discovered allowing to improve the ifmr",
    ". our study will be useful to re - assess all uncertainties in the _ gaia _ era .",
    "little is known about the fraction of white dwarfs that are the product of mergers ( wd+wd , wd+rg , or rg+rg , where rg stands for red giant ) in the solar neighborhood . @xcite",
    "have analysed the kinematics of massive sdss white dwarfs and demonstrated that they have the characteristics of a young singly - evolved population . from multi - epoch spectroscopy of sdss white dwarfs ,",
    "@xcite have calculated the wd+wd merger rate to be around @xmath102 yr@xmath103 .",
    "binary population synthesis models predict merger rates that are about twice as large @xcite . for the last 10 gyr , this leads to approximately one merger product in our main sdss subsample in the range @xmath23 ( k ) @xmath68 22,000 . on the other hand , this does not include stars that have merged before both of them became white dwarfs ( wd+rg or rg+rg ) , which could account for a larger fraction .",
    "however , there is little evidence that a merging process involving red giants would favour the production of white dwarfs that are more massive than the average @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , early investigations of the white dwarf mass distribution have identified a high - mass peak or so - called bump around 0.8 @xmath7 @xcite , and proposed a merger population as a possible cause .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite have also suggested that the high - mass peak is likely due to mergers .",
    "however , these studies are not based on extensive simulations of stellar populations , which for instance @xcite are cautious to mention .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite suggests that mergers account for @xmath53% of the 20  pc sample .",
    "this is much larger than the observed wd+wd merger rate .    from the simulations performed in this work",
    ", we can suggest a number of alternatives to explain features in the field white dwarf mass distribution .",
    "first of all , our standard set of simulations already predict too many massive white dwarfs .",
    "hence there is no need to invoke mergers to explain even the most massive ( non - magnetic ) white dwarfs in the current samples .",
    "this applies to the sdss mass distribution at all temperatures according to table  [ fg : t2 ] .",
    "furthermore , even our standard simulations have a bump around 0.8 @xmath7 , and this is most easily seen when we neglect observational errors in fig .",
    "[ fg : f10 ] .",
    "this feature is in fact due to the two - piece polynomial fit to the ifmr of @xcite .",
    "it is not present when using any linear ifmr .",
    "we do not claim that it is a real astrophysical feature of the ifmr even though our parameterisation was motivated by theoretical imfrs @xcite .",
    "it merely demonstrates that current constraints on single star evolution and the ifmr do not rule out the presence of a high - mass peak .",
    "finally , there are number of biases that impact the field white dwarf mass distribution , the combination of which could cause the high - mass peak .",
    "we conclude that no evidence of wd+wd mergers can be found in the field white dwarf mass distribution .",
    "we have presented a thorough study on the astrophysical interpretation of the field white dwarf mass distribution .",
    "we have chosen the well studied 20  pc and sdss samples , restricting the latter to @xmath23 ( k ) @xmath68 22,000 , @xmath104 , and single non - magnetic white dwarfs in order to have a well understood completeness .",
    "our approach has been to perform monte carlo simulations to compare with the observations .",
    "the first result of this work is that we predict a larger mean mass for the 20  pc sample in comparison to the sdss sample , in agreement with the observations .",
    "this suggests that the photometric technique and model atmospheres of cool white dwarfs , largely employed for the local sample , are in agreement with the results of the spectroscopic technique for hotter da and db white dwarfs is the sdss .",
    "our simulations reproduce reasonably well the samples studied in this work using standard assumptions about stellar and galactic evolution .",
    "however , for both samples our simulations predict too many high - mass white dwarfs ( @xmath105 @xmath7 ) by a factor of @xmath51.5 . from our extensive review of biases that impact our simulations , we find that this offset is not unexpected .",
    "probable causes are uncertainties in the assumed ifmr , imf , sfh , variation of galactic disk vertical scale height as a function of total stellar age , binary evolution , neglect of magnetic white dwarfs ( sdss ) , and unidentified faint massive objects ( 20  pc sample ) . while a majority of these uncertainties will be improved with _ gaia _ , it could remain a challenge to disentangle the effects from the ifmr and imf .",
    "our results challenge the interpretation that there is evidence for a population of wd+wd mergers in the field white dwarf mass distribution . on the contrary",
    ", we find no observed excess of high - mass objects and features in the observed distributions can not be unambiguously linked to mergers .",
    "we note that our results do not rule out a population wd+ms or wd+wd mergers that are not preferentially massive , or that some percentage of known massive single white dwarfs , e.g. with large magnetic fields , could be directly linked to a merger event .",
