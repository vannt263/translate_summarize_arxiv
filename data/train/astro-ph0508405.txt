    "we also use the radio - submillimeter correlation to estimate a minimum redshift for the source , as the radio flux is unlikely to be significantly agn - enhanced .",
    "formally , these correlations should be used as a statistical redshift indicator , so with that caveat we present the minimum redshift of ssg  1 based on the 1.4ghz upper limit ( table 1 ) and an 850@xmath1 m flux derived from the best - fitting stardust2 sed ( figure 2 ) . using the relations of dunne , clements & eales ( 2000 ) and carilli & yun ( 2000a ; 2000b ) we get @xmath36 of 1.2 and 1.5 respectively .",
    "the photometric redshift is more secure than the radio - submillimeter correlation since the latter is prone to systematics caused by uncertain dust temperatures ( see clements et al .",

    "2002 ; webb et al . 2004 ; frayer et al . 2004 ) , which comprise two classes of galaxies : elliptical and dusty star - forming luminous infrared galaxies ( but a significant submillimeter flux is usually indicative of the latter class ) .",
    "eros are thought to comprise a significant fraction of the cosmic star formation density at redshifts of one and higher ( cimatti et al . 2002 ) , the epoch by which the majority of the universe s star formation has taken place ( dickinson et al . 2003 ; rudnick et al . 2003 ) .",
    "determining the effective dust temperature of the source allows us to estimate the total fraction of the bolometric luminosity that is reprocessed by the dust .",

    "iso_-selected ulirgs rather than high redshift scuba - selected smgs .",
    "if there exists a population of galaxies with properties similar to ssg  1 , in a redshift space between _ iso _ and scuba , it may be argued that observations at 350@xmath1 m , in conjunction with the current _ iso _ , _ spitzer _ and scuba samples , could describe the ir - luminous population from 0.3@xmath64.0 ( although the scuba - selected galaxies will be more luminous ) .",
    "not only would this population bridge the gap in redshift space , but also the gap in `` dust temperature space '' ( and consequently `` dust mass space '' ) .",
