    "the matrix of canonical qcd hamiltonian is too large for a direct diagonalization using computers .",
    "one cause of the forbidding size is the dynamical coupling among bare degrees of freedom across an infinite range of energy scales .",
    "this difficulty is manifest in all local quantum field theories of physical interest through ultraviolet divergences .",
    "one possible method to attack the divergence problem in the case of asymptotically free theories is to first evaluate an effective hamiltonian and then attempt diagonalization of the corresponding effective matrix .",
    "for some well adjusted effective degrees of freedom may interact over only a limited range of energy scales , whereby a definition of a finite effective eigenvalue sub - problem becomes conceivable and its subsequent solution using computers is not immediately excluded . to derive the effective hamiltonians one can use similarity renormalization group ( rg ) procedure @xcite .",
    "this article discusses the accuracy that the similarity procedure can achieve in evaluating the effective hamiltonians in perturbation theory .",
    "the latter is the only systematic method that exists for handling the initial canonical qcd hamiltonian .    having a perturbatively calculated effective hamiltonian , @xmath0 , that strongly couples effective basis states",
    "only if their free energies , i.e. eigenvalues of certain @xmath1 , do not differ by more than a finite width parameter @xmath2 , one can cut out a sub - matrix @xmath3 from the matrix of @xmath4 in the effective basis .",
    "the energy range of the sub - matrix @xmath3 can be limited to few or several widths @xmath2 .",
    "such @xmath3 contains only a fraction of the matrix elements of @xmath4 , which is why @xmath3 is called a _",
    "window_. one can diagonalize the window numerically and obtain the part of the spectrum of @xmath5 that is matched by the selected window .",
    "for example , the energy range of the window matrix @xmath3 can be limited to the region where a bound state is formed .",
    "the question is then how accurate the perturbative rg derivation of @xmath4 can be for the matrix elements in such @xmath3 .",
    "the issue was studied previously @xcite using a particularly elegant version of the similarity transformation generator , which was taken from wegner s flow equation for hamiltonians in solid state physics @xcite . in the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hamiltonian @xmath0 could be calculated numerically with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "one could also calculate the same hamiltonian in perturbation theory .",
    "then , one could compare results of numerical diagonalization of the resulting windows cut out from the exact and from the perturbative results for @xmath4 .",
    "the model study @xcite showed that wegner s generator produced quite useful first three terms in an effective coupling constant expansion for the window hamiltonian , @xmath6 .",
    "diagonalization of this @xmath3 produced surprisingly good accuracy on the order of 10% .",
    "the bound state eigenvalue of @xmath3 matched the exact one with so small error even when @xmath2 was reduced down to the range that corresponded to 1 gev in qcd .",
    "moreover , only a handful of basis states were sufficient in the numerical diagonalization .",
    "however , @xmath7 grew in the asymptotically free model when @xmath2 was made small , which is a generic feature for asymptotic freedom , and @xmath7 became comparable with 1 for @xmath8 1 gev .",
    "at the same time , the coefficients of the perturbative expansion for matrix elements of @xmath3 beyond the first three terms turned out to form an alternating series with growing coefficients and , eventually , for @xmath2 still much larger than 1 gev , results including terms proportional to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc . turned out to be useless .",
    "higher - than - second order terms led to erratic behavior of @xmath3 and its eigenvalues .",
    "this result required a closer inspection to decide if one could improve the perturbative part of the similarity approach by using other generators than wegner s , and whether any serious investment in a vastly more complex qcd calculations should ever be made using this method .",
    "the problem was not only quantitative , with details depending on the model chosen for study , but also qualitative .",
    "namely , one needed to know if any significant improvement was possible in principle , because the growth of @xmath7 for decreasing @xmath2 in asymptotically free theories is in basic conflict with the goal of reducing the width @xmath2 down to the binding scale using perturbation theory . since there are not many exactly soluble models with asymptotic freedom and bound states , it was important to find out if any improvement could be obtained in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the optimization task may be attempted in similarity rg procedure by taking advantage of the fact that the generator of the similarity transformation can be chosen in infinitely many different ways .",
    "it is plausible that the convergence problems emerged in the wegner case because interactions with large energy changes were very quickly eliminated and such rapid elimination could produce large feedback in the low - energy dynamics , too large for easy reproduction through a perturbative expansion . therefore , this work is focused on the question if varying the similarity generator , especially the rate at which the off - diagonal terms are removed , can improve convergence of at least the first five terms in the expansion , i.e. all terms up to and including order @xmath10 .",
    "the number 4 is distinguished by the fact that one needs at least four orders of perturbation theory to simultaneously account for effective masses and running coupling in quark - gluon dynamics in qcd .",
    "the answer found in the model studied here is positive .",
    "namely , it is shown below that one can obtain a systematic expansion for @xmath3 into powers of @xmath7 , and the sum of first 5 terms in the expansion produces at least three times better accuracy than in ref .",
    "when an optimized version of the similarity generator is identified , one can include higher order terms than 4th .",
    "for example , it will be shown here that 6th order improves the accuracy to 10 times better than achieved previously using wegner s generator in the model .",
    "sensitivity of the effective theory to the finite bare cutoff in numerical calculations is also reduced by at least an order of magnitude ( this will be explained later ) and control over numerical instabilities that emerge in the rg evolution is also enhanced ( this aspect is only mentioned ) . the main result reported here , however , is not that a class of similarity generators leads to improvement in the model chosen for this study , but that the flexibility available in the similarity renormalization group procedure does lead to considerable options for improved convergence pattern .",
    "since the similarity approach to qcd has already evolved in the effective particle version to third order terms @xcite and systematic studies of bound states will become possible once the fourth order terms are brought under numerical control @xcite , the options for improving convergence need to be further explored in more complex models .",
    "also , the development of wegner s flow equations in solid state physics and field theory @xcite , has already demonstrated that new options for optimization may have much broader range of applicability than the qcd bound state problem could suggest by itself . besides",
    ", if the window hamiltonians of interest could be reliably evaluated using perturbation theory , the standard quantum mechanical calculus could then be employed to describe with them the time evolution of selected states with efficiency probably hard to match by any other method .",

    "it is more practical in the model to apply a numerical algorithm and generate matrices @xmath57 order by order through runge - kutta integration of @xmath58 coupled non - linear differential equations .    once the expansion of eq .",

    "the next orders in the expansion are wrong by huge factors and completely unacceptable , including the fact that they render spurious negative eigenvalues .",

    "( [ czynnik.moj ] ) .",
    "two basic options can be considered .",
    "one is to make @xmath73 , which accelerates changes in the matrix elements @xmath36 as functions of @xmath2 , and the other is to make @xmath74 , which slows down the changes .",
    "numerical calculations show that the acceleration with a factor of the type @xmath75 with @xmath76 ranging between 0.01 and 100 does not change the erratic behavior of the window to any better .",
    "in contrast , slowing down the evolution by the factor of the type @xmath77 produces significant improvements .",

    "moreover , the accuracy of the eigenvalue calculated by diagonalization of the fourth order window reaches 3% , which is unattainable using wegner s generator .    , but with the hamiltonian matrix elements calculated in first six successive orders of perturbation theory using eq .",
    "( [ f_moj ] ) for the similarity generator , instead of wegners.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the particular choice of @xmath39 follows from the observation that 4th order results are less accurate than the 3rd order for @xmath79 , while for @xmath80 no further improvement is obtained in the accuracy of the 4th order terms .",
    "figure [ moje ] shows also results of including orders 5th and 6th for @xmath81 .",
    "inclusion of 6th order contribution achieves the accuracy of 1% for the bound state eigenvalue , which is 10 times better than with the wegner generator .",
    "since the contribution of 6th order is larger than 5th , one may consider larger @xmath76 , around @xmath82 , to obtain a more systematic inclusion of successive orders as required .",
    "this issue will not be further discussed here , since already the 4th order of rigorous perturbation theory ( two loops ) for effective hamiltonians in qcd is currently not known .    finally , one has to address the issue of renormalizability since for @xmath83 the similarity transformation generator approaches zero within the bounds set by the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath17 and no rg evolution occurs .",
    "the question is then how strongly the effective window hamiltonians @xmath3 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 gev , depend on @xmath17 .",
    "this can be studied by inspection of examples and",
    "the result is that the generator with @xmath81 produces considerably more efficient approach to renormalized effective theory than wegner s .",
    "the measure of how quickly the renormalized effective theory is achieved is found by evaluating 64 matrix elements of the exact window @xmath3 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath21 , and for @xmath88 .",
    "these matrix elements are most important in the formation of bound - state in the effective dynamics . in both cases the bare coupling constant",

    "[ 4wegner ] and [ moje ] , the chosen window is most suitable for diagonalization .",
    "one can not rely on a comprison at one value of @xmath2 because , as it is visible in fig .",
    "[ glambdar ] , the formation of bound states occurs in wegner s case ( @xmath92 ) and for @xmath93 at different values of @xmath2 , being shifted toward smaller values of @xmath2 for @xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that the resulting measure @xmath94 for the wegner generator varies between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , with numerical accuracy being of significance , while for @xmath81 one obtains a numerically stable result , approximately equal @xmath97 in the whole range between 4 and 1 gev .",
    "the utility of logarithmic ( i.e. depending on exponents @xmath98 and @xmath14 of the base @xmath99 ) slowing down of rg evolution of the off - diagonal matrix elements originates from two sources .",
    "one is the smaller size of the effective coupling constant in the region where the bound state is formed , as seen in fig .",
    "[ glambdar ] .",

    "the other source is that coefficients of the perturbative series in powers of @xmath7 for matrix elements of @xmath4 derived with slower generator are not growing with the order as they do in wegner s case .",
