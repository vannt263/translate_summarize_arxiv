    "the effect of correlations is most prominent for low dimensional systems , and recent experimental realization@xcite of a strongly interacting tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas of bosons opens new perspectives in experimental studies of strongly interacting systems in 1d@xcite . in this article",
    "we investigate bose - fermi mixtures in 1d , using exact techniques of the bethe ansatz .",
    "some of the results presented here have been reported earlier @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical research on bose - fermi mixtures@xcite so far has been concentrated on higher dimensional systems , and only recently 1d systems started attracting attention .",
    "several properties of such systems have been investigated so far , including phase separation@xcite , fermion pairing@xcite , possibility of charge density wave ( cdw ) formation@xcite and long distance behavior of correlation functions@xcite .",
    "a 1d interacting bose - fermi mixture is described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 here , @xmath7 are boson and fermion operators , @xmath8 are the masses , and @xmath9 are bose - bose and bose - fermi interaction strengths .",
    "the model ( [ initialhamiltoniansc ] ) is exactly solvable , when@xcite @xmath10 it corresponds to the situation when masses are the same , and bose - bose and bose - fermi interaction strengths are the same and positive .",
    "although conditions ( [ intercond ] ) are somewhat restrictive , the exactly solvable case is relevant to current experiments ( the experimental situation will be analyzed in detail in section [ experiments ] ) and can be used to check the validity of different approximate approaches .",
    "model ( [ initialhamiltoniansc ] ) under conditions ( [ intercond ] ) has been considered in the literature before@xcite , but its properties have not been investigated in detail . after the appearance of our initial report @xcite , two additional articles @xcite used bethe ansatz to investigate the same model .",
    "we use the exact solution to calculate the ground state energy and investigate phase separation and collective modes at zero temperature . for strongly interacting regime , we calculate single particle correlation functions , and consider the effects of small temperature on correlation functions and density profiles .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ bareview ]",
    "we review the bethe ansatz solution for bose - fermi mixture and compare it to the solution for fermi mixture .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are resolved with the help of extra bethe - ansatz .",
    "this idea has been generalized by sutherland @xcite for the case of n - fermion species .",
    "the results presented here can be simply derived from sutherland s work .    in yang",
    "s solution , one assumes the generalized coordinate bethe wavefunction of the following form : for @xmath19 @xmath20 e^{i\\sum{k_{p_i } x_{q_i } } } , e=\\sum_i k^2_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a set of unequal numbers , @xmath22 is an arbitrary permutation from @xmath23 and @xmath24 $ ] is @xmath25 matrix .",

    "however , the averaged correlation function still shows significant change in the region of temperatures of the order of @xmath465 and the results for @xmath597 and @xmath598 are shown in fig .",
    "[ nztldacorr ] .",
    "the point where @xmath599 has a discontinuous derivative for @xmath510 corresponds to the fermi wavevector for the maximal density of fermions ( at the edge of the bosonic cloud ) . for comparison , we also show @xmath599 for the same number of fermions in the same trap for noninteracting case .    in conclusion",
    ", we presented a model for interacting bose - fermi mixture in 1d , which is exactly solvable by bethe ansatz technique .",
    "we obtained the energy numerically in the thermodynamic limit , and used it to prove the absence of the demixing under conditions ( [ intercond ] ) , contrary to prediction of a mean field approximation .",
    "combining exact solution with local density approximation ( lda ) in a harmonic trap , we calculated the density profiles and frequencies of collective modes in various limits . in the strongly interacting regime , we predicted the appearance of low - lying collective oscillations which correspond to the counterflow of the two species .",
    "in the strongly interacting regime we used exact wavefunction to calculate the single particle correlation functions for bosons and fermions at zero temperature under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we derived an analytical formula , which allows to calculate correlation functions at all distances numerically for a polynomial time in system size .",
    "we investigated numerically two strong singularities of the momentum distribution for fermions at @xmath0 and @xmath1 we extended the results for correlation functions for low temperatures , and calculated correlation functions in the crossover regime from @xmath510 to `` spin disordered '' regime .",
    "we also calculated the evolution of the density profile in a harmonic trap at small nonzero temperatures .",
    "we showed , that in strongly interacting regime correlation functions change dramatically as temperature changes from @xmath2 to a small temperature @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the total density and @xmath155 is the lieb - liniger parameter .",
    "finally , we analyzed the experimental situation , proposed several ways to implement the exactly solvable hamiltonian and combined the results for correlation functions with lda .",
    "in this appendix we will prove that all solutions of equations ( [ bfequation1])-([bfequation2 ] ) @xmath600 are always real .",
    "this is a major simplification for the analysis of the excited states compared to spin-@xmath11 fermion systems , where one has to consider complex solutions@xcite .",
    "first , lets prove that @xmath603 suppose that ( [ app3 ] ) is not valid , i. e. @xmath604 then @xmath605 and absolute value of the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ app1 ] ) is bigger than 1 , which contradicts the equation .",
    "equation ( [ app4 ] ) can be proven similarly .",
    "suppose that ( [ app5 ] ) is not valid , i. e. @xmath607 from ( [ app4 ] ) it follows that @xmath608 therefore @xmath609 and absolute value of the rhs of equation ( [ app2 ] ) is not smaller than 1 .",
    "on the other hand , by assumption lhs of this equation is smaller than 1 : @xmath610 contradiction proves the validity of ( [ app5 ] ) , and ( [ app6 ] ) can be proven similarly .",
