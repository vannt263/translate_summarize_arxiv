    "this talk is an overview of mesonic chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) concentrating on a number of recent developments .",
    "chiral perturbation theory can best be described by `` exploring the consequences of the chiral symmetry of qcd and its spontaneous breaking using effective field theory techniques . ''",

    "a good discussion of the underlying assumptions can be found in  @xcite .",

    "a general effective field theory ( eft ) needs three principles : the correct degrees of freedom , there has to be a power - counting principle to ensure predictivity and one should remember the associated range of validity . for chpt",
    "the degrees of freedom are the nambu - goldstone bosons from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the chiral symmetry of massless qcd , the power - counting for mesonic chpt is dimensional counting in momenta and meson masses , and the range of validity stops somewhere below the mass of the first not included resonance , the rho .",
    "the qcd lagrangian @xmath1\\ ] ] has an @xmath2 global chiral symmetry when @xmath3 .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the quark - antiquark vacuum - expectation - value @xmath4 .",
    "the mechanism is discussed in the talk by l.  giusti .",
    "the remaining symmetry group is @xmath5 , we have thus 8 broken generators and get 8 goldstone bosons whose interaction vanishes at zero momentum .",
    "the latter allows for a consistent power counting via dimensional counting @xcite .",
    "there are many extensions of chpt in different directions .",
    "some of them are :    * which chiral symmetry : @xmath6 , for @xmath7 and extensions to ( partially ) quenched * or beyond qcd * space - time symmetry : continuum or broken on the lattice : wilson , staggered , mixed action * volume : infinite , finite in space , finite t * which interactions to include beyond the strong one * which particles included as non goldstone bosons    my general belief is that if it involves soft pions ( or soft @xmath8 ) some version of chpt exists .",
    "the lagrangians are written in terms of the special unitary matrix , parametrizing @xmath9 , @xmath10 in terms of these the lowest order lagrangian is given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 in terms of the left and right external currents : @xmath14 and scalar and pseudo - scalar external densities : @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "quark masses are included via the scalar density : @xmath16 .",

    "let me just add a reminder about the main properties of chpt : it relates processes with different numbers of pseudo - scalars , includes isospin and the eightfold way ( @xmath5 ) and unitarity and analyticity effects are included perturbatively .",
    "the best known consequence are the chiral logarithms , e.g. for the example of the pion mass  @xcite @xmath21 + \\cdots\\ ] ] with @xmath22 the lowest - order mass .",
    "one of the problems in practically using chpt is to have values for the unknown lecs .",
    "the original determination was done in @xcite at the @xmath18 level .",
    "however , all needed observables are known to order @xmath19 , as reviewed in @xcite . the latest update of the lecs can be found in @xcite .",
    "the two - flavour constants , quoted in the subtraction - scale - independent form @xmath23 , are @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 follow from the @xmath27-scattering analysis @xcite , see also @xcite .",

    "the three flavour first full @xmath19 fit was done in @xcite . including many more observables and new data , a major update was done by @xcite and a final update with the same experimental input but some more information on @xmath19 lecs in @xcite .",

    "an overview of the lattice work is the flag second report  @xcite .",
    "for the three - flavour case we have that @xmath35 so a question is whether chpt works at all in this sector .",
    "the contributions from the not very well known @xmath19 lecs are much larger and there is the question of the importance of @xmath36 suppressed terms . in @xcite a large number of observables was checked and a number of relations found that were independent of the @xmath19 lecs and only depend on @xmath18 lecs via loop contributions . with 76 observables we found 35 relations .",
    "for 13 of these there were enough experimental data available .",
    "the resulting picture was that three - flavour chpt works but might converge slowly in some cases .",
    "the data included for a fit of @xmath37 are :    * @xmath38 * @xmath39 , @xmath40 slope and curvature of @xmath41 * @xmath27 and @xmath42 scattering lengths @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "these terms are easier to calculate than the remaining ones at the same loop level .",
    "the underlying reason is that physical quantities must be independent of the subtraction scale , @xmath196 and that divergences in local quantum field theory are always local .    in a renormalizable quantum field theory",

    "the problem is that each order new terms in the lagrangians show up , so new one - loop diagrams are required and new vertices at each new order .",
    "the problem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figrge ] for the case of the mass at two - loop order .",

    "we realized in @xcite that a construction of a minimal lagrangian at each order is not necessary . when calculating the divergences using a method that preserves the underlying symmetry the produced divergence structure will automatically have the correct symmetry and reducing it to its most minimal form or even rewriting it in a fully symmetric form is not needed .",
    "the consequence is that things can be computerized and simply let run using form @xcite .",
    "we first pushed the massive nonlinear @xmath205 model to rather large orders for the masses , form - factors and scattering in @xcite and solved the large @xmath141-limit to all orders also for the massive case using gap equation techniques . a very strong check of the result is to use different parametrizations of the lowest - order lagrangian",
