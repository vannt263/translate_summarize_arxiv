    "the electroweak penguin decay @xmath17 is loop - suppressed in the standard model(sm ) .",
    "it may therefore provide a rigorous test of the sm and also put strong constraints on the flavor physics beyond the sm .    though the inclusive decay @xmath18 is better understood theoretically using the operator product expansion , and the first direct experimental measurements of the dilepton invariant mass spectrum and @xmath19-distribution are already at hand  @xcite , being an inclusive process",
    ", it is extremely difficult to be measured in a hadron machine , such as the lhc , which is the only collider , except for a super - b factory , that could provide enough luminosity for the precise study of the decay distributions of such a rare process .",
    "in contrast , for the exclusive decay @xmath17 , the difficulty lies in the imprecise knowledge of the underlying hadron dynamics .",
    "experimentally , babar @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations have observed this rare decay with the branching ratios : @xmath20 we note that the belle measurements are approximately a factor 2 higher than the corresponding babar measurements .",
    "in addition , belle has published the measurements  @xcite of the so - called forward - backward asymmetry ( fba )  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the best - fit results by belle for the wilson coefficient ratios for negative value of @xmath21 , @xmath22 are consistent with the sm values @xmath23 and @xmath24 , evaluated in the nlo approximation ( see table i ) . with more data accumulated at the current b factories , and especially the huge data that will be produced at the lhc , it is foreseeable that the dilepton invariant mass spectrum and the fba in this channel will be measured precisely in several years from now , allowing a few % measurements of the wilson coefficient ratios and the sign of @xmath21 .",
    "theoretically , the exclusive decay @xmath17 has been studied in a number of papers , see for example @xcite . from the viewpoint of hadron dynamics",
    ", the application of the qcd factorization approach @xcite to this channel @xcite deserves special mention , as we shall be comparing our phenomenological analysis with the results obtained in this paper .",
    "the emergence of an effective theory , called soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , provides a systematic and rigorous way to deal with the perturbative strong interaction effects in b decays in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "a lot of theoretical work has been done in scet related to the so - called heavy - to - light transitions in @xmath25 decays , in particular , a demonstration of the soft - collinear factorization  @xcite , a complete catalogue of the various 2-body and 3-body current operators  @xcite , and the extension of scet to two effective theories scet@xmath26 and scet@xmath27 , with the two - step matching qcd @xmath28 scet@xmath26 @xmath28 scet@xmath27  @xcite . among various phenomenological applications reported in the literature , scet has been used to prove the factorization of radiative @xmath29 decays at leading power in @xmath1 and to all orders in @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "likewise , scet , in combination with the heavy - hadron chiral perturbation theory , has also been used to study the forward - backward asymmetry in the non - resonant decay @xmath30 in certain kinematic region  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to use scet in the decay @xmath17 . due to the similarity between @xmath31 and @xmath32 decays ,",
    "our approach is quite similar to the earlier scet - based studies  @xcite , in particular to ref .",
    "moreover , an analysis of the exclusive radiative and semileptonic decays @xmath33 and @xmath34 in scet can be combined with data to reduce the uncertainties in the input parameters . in particular , as we show here , the location of the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath35 can be predicted more precisely than is the case in the existing literature .",
    "it is well known that , when @xmath10 , the momentum squared of the lepton pair , is comparable to @xmath36 , the resonant charmonium contributions become very important , for which there is no model - independent treatment yet .",
    "likewise , for higher @xmath10-values , higher @xmath37-resonances @xmath38 have to be included .",
    "thus , in the following we will restrict ourselves to the region @xmath39 , which is dominated by the short - distance contribution .",
    "note that the lower cut - off @xmath40 is taken here because , as we shall see later , when @xmath10 is very small , say @xmath41 , the factorization of the annihilation topology breaks down . in this kinematic region , a factorization formula for the decay amplitude of @xmath35 , which holds to @xmath42 at the leading power in @xmath1 , has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite using the qcd factorization approach we shall derive the factorization of the decay amplitude of @xmath35 in scet , which _ formally _ coincides with the formula obtained by beneke et al .",

    "@xcite , obtained in the qcd factorization approach , the main phenomenological improvement is that for the hard scattering function @xmath47 , the perturbative logarithms are summed from the hard scale @xmath51 down to the intermediate scale @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represents a typical hadronic scale .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly review the basic ideas and notations of scet .",
    "we then list the relevant effective operators in scet and do the explicit matching calculations from qcd to scet@xmath26  ( sec .",
    "ii a ) and from scet@xmath26 to scet@xmath27  ( sec .  ii b ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the effective scet operators are given in sec .",
    "ii c. at the end of this section , the logarithmic resummation in scet@xmath26 is discussed . in section iii",
    ", we consider some phenomenological aspects of the @xmath32 decay .",
    "we first specify the input parameters , especially the soft form factors @xmath54  ( sec .",
    "iii a ) , which are the cause of the largest theoretical uncertainty .",
    "we use the @xmath10-dependence of the related qcd form factors in the lc - qcd sum rule approach , but fix the normalization of these soft form factors using constraints from data on the exclusive decays @xmath8 . in sec .",
    "iii b , we work out numerically the evolution of the b - type scet@xmath26 matching coefficients , defined earlier in sec .",
    "we then give the dilepton invariant mass spectrum and the forward - backward asymmetry in the decay @xmath17 , and compare the integrated branching ratios with the measurements from babar and belle ( sec .",
    "we end with a summary of our results in section iv and suggestions for future measurements to reduce the model dependence due to the form factors and other input parameters .",
    "for the @xmath55 transitions , the weak effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath56 where we have neglected the contribution proportional to @xmath57 in the penguin ( loop ) amplitudes , which is doubly cabibbo - suppressed , and have used the unitarity of the ckm matrix to factorize the overall ckm - matrix element dependence .",
    "we use the operator basis introduced in @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the su(3 ) color matrix , @xmath60 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath61 is the current mass of the b quark in the @xmath62 scheme at the scale @xmath63 .    restricting ourselves to the kinematic region @xmath39 , the light @xmath45 meson moves fast with a large momentum of the order of @xmath64 , which thus can be viewed approximately as a collinear particle . for convenience ,",
    "let us assume that the @xmath45 meson is moving in the direction of the light - like reference vector @xmath65 , then its momentum can be decomposed as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is another light - like reference vector satisfying @xmath68 . in this light - cone frame ,",
    "the collinear momentum of @xmath45 is expressed as @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "in addition to this collinear mode , the soft and hard - collinear modes , with momenta scaling as @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , are also necessary to correctly reproduce the infrared behavior of full qcd .",
    "scet introduces fields for every momentum mode and we will encounter the following quark and gluon fields @xmath73 in the above , the symbol @xmath74 stands for the gluon field , @xmath75 represents a heavy - quark field , the symbols @xmath76 and @xmath77 stand for the light quark fields , and the subscripts c , s , hc stand for collinear , soft and hard - collinear modes , respectively . note that the momentum @xmath77 of the lepton pair is taken as a hard collinear momentum , since in this paper we only consider the range @xmath78 .",
    "that is why an extra hard - collinear field @xmath79 in the @xmath80 direction is required later . as explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , to construct the gauge invariant operators in scet , it is more convenient to introduce the building blocks , given below , which are obtained by multiplying the fields by the wilson lines which run along the light - ray to infinity : @xmath81 for example , the field @xmath82 is defined as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the hard collinear wilson line .",
