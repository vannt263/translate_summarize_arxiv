    "amorphous carbon ( _ _ a-__c ) thin films are amorphous semiconductors with a tunable band gap . unlike other group iv amorphous semiconductors , such as _ a_-si or _",

    "a_-c between that of diamond ( 100% @xmath6 , band gap @xmath8 ) and graphite ( 100% @xmath5 , semimetal with @xmath9 ) .",
    "studies of _ a_-c , diamond - like materials and carbon nanotubes have long focused on the superior mechanical properties .",
    "however , recent developments in novel electronic and spintronic materials have drawn attention to the electrical , optical and magneto - electronic properties  @xcite .",
    "room - temperature positive magnetoresistance ( mr@xmath1060% ) was found in some magnetically - doped carbon thin films such as co@xmath1c@xmath2  @xcite and ni@xmath1c@xmath2  @xcite , with granular magnetic particles in an amorphous carbon matrix .",
    "room - temperature positive mr was also reported for non - magnetically - doped ( b - doped ) polycrystalline diamond thin films ( mr@xmath10100% )  @xcite and undoped _ a_-c / n - si ( mr@xmath1012% ) two - layer structures  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest potential technological applications of carbon - based thin films for electronics and spintronics applications .    in this work",
    ", we have co - sputtered _ a_-c and the magnetic rare earth element gd ( _ _ a-__gd@xmath1c@xmath2(:h@xmath3 ) ) with a wide range of _ x _ , and studied the magnetic and magneto - transport properties .",
    "gd has a half - filled _ f _ electron shell and is trivalent in solids , which gives rise to a large local moment with _ _ j__=__s__=7/2 and three valence electrons .",
    "previous studies on gd - doped e - beam co - evaporated amorphous si have shown strong interactions between the magnetic moments and carriers leading to very large negative mr ( e.g. 10@xmath11 at 1 k ) , anomalous magneto - optical properties and spin - glass freezing [ refs ] .",
    "the magnitude of this temperature - dependent negative mr below a characteristic temperature ( @xmath12 ) was suggested to depend on electron screening related to the metallicity of the amorphous matrix  @xcite .",
    "screening is related to the band gap of the host semiconductor materials : narrower band gap corresponding to larger dielectric constant ( @xmath13 ) causing more screening and reducing the effective interaction , leading to smaller mr and lower @xmath12 . evidence for this trend was that mr and @xmath12 were smaller for high @xmath4 and for _ _ a-__gd - ge compared to _ a_-gd - si samples  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the mr will be larger and occur at higher temperatures for a wider band gap matrix .",
    "one motivation of the present study was to make use of the tunable band gap of _",
    "a_-c , which depends on the @xmath7 configuration , and then to study the magneto - transport properties of this type of thin film .",
    "the inclusion of gd is shown to have large effects on transport and magnetic properties of the _",
    "a_-c(:h ) films .",
    "the dual roles of gd in this material lead to strong interactions between the carriers and the magnetic moments , giving an enormous negative mr with strong temperature dependence at low temperature .",
    "gd also has large influence on the carbon bonding thus film structure , which was studied using several complementary characterization methods",
    ". correlations between the microstructure , bonding and other physical properties are discussed , and explanations for the properties are provided based on material and electronic structures .",
    "the _ _ a-__gd - c(:h ) films were prepared by co - sputtering high purity gd and c targets onto substrates held at room temperature .",
    "samples for ion - beam analysis were grown on mgo substrates , and samples for magnetization and magneto - transport measurements were grown on insulating amorphous sin@xmath14-covered si substrates .",
    "various gd doping concentrations were achieved by controlling the ratio of the gd / c flux .",
    "the base pressure prior to deposition was @xmath105@xmath1510@xmath16 torr .",
    "the sputtering gas ( ar ) working pressure was kept low ( 1.3@xmath102.0 mtorr ) in order to increase the mean free path of the sputtered atoms , thus preserving the initial kinetic energy of the sputtered target atoms , which is desirable for decreasing the @xmath17 ratio  @xcite . at this low sputtering pressure ,",
    "the mean free path is comparable to the distance between cathode and substrate , so the number of collisions is @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the adatom energy is likely to be preserved near the initial energy ( estimated to be 5 - 10 ev , depending on the sputtering power  @xcite ) gained from the ar - target atom momentum - transfer process .",
    "it has been reported that the concentration of metastable @xmath6 bonds increases with c atom energy and reaches a maximum in an energy window @xmath10100 ev  @xcite .",
    "therefore , typical sputtered _ a_-c films are dominated by @xmath5 sites . in order to suppress the graphitic @xmath5 bonding and promote the @xmath6 bonding",
    ", we introduced h atoms using a 95%ar:5%h@xmath18 mixture gas at the substrate in addition to pure ar gas introduced at the gd and c targets .",
    "different h incorporation was achieved by changing the ar/(95%ar:5%h@xmath18 ) flow ratio or by introducing a pure mixture 95%ar:5%h@xmath18 at the targets as the sputtering gas .",
    "ion - beam analysis including rutherford backscattering ( rbs ) with c resonance energy and hydrogen forward scattering ( hfs ) was used to determine the gd , c and h concentrations .",
    "rbs also provided the atomic areal density from which atomic number density was obtained based on the film thickness as measured by nanopics@xmath19 atomic force microscope profilometer .",
    "high resolution cross - sectional transmission electron microscopy ( hr - xtem ) with a jeol jem-4000ex was used to determine the film microstructure .",
    "magnetization was measured in a quantum design mpms@xmath19 superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer .",
    "magneto - transport measurements were carried out on samples with lithographically defined hall bar patterns , with the magnetic field applied parallel to the film plane and to the applied current .",
    "this geometry leads to effects dominated by interactions with the gd spin , rather than quantum backscattering .",
    "figure  [ fig : hrxtem ] shows typical hr - xtem images for two samples . for both the hydrogen - free ( figure  [ fig : hrxtem](a ) ) and",
    "hydrogenated ( figure  [ fig : hrxtem](b ) ) gd - doped films , the electron micrographs show dense amorphous microstructure , without any observable clustering or crystallization up to at least 22 at.% gd .",
    "the resulting films were very stable in ambient conditions .",
    "the same dense and featureless microstructure was also observed in other sputtered amorphous alloys prepared at low ar pressure , such as _ _ a-__gd - si  @xcite . by contrast , _ _ a-__gd - si showed open columnar structure leading to massive oxidation when sputtered at ar pressures of @xmath106 mtorr .",
    "these results demonstrate that , under proper conditions , magnetron co - sputtering is an excellent method for obtaining a uniform distribution of dopants in amorphous group iv semiconductors ( well above the thermodynamic equilibrium )",
    ".      figure  [ fig : rbs ] shows a rbs spectrum for an _ a_-gd - c sample .",
    "the backscattering yield @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 , the areal density of the element of interest , where @xmath22 is the number density ( in atoms/@xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the film thickness .",
    "@xmath20 is proportional to @xmath25 so that low-@xmath26 elements , such as carbon , have a much smaller yield than high-@xmath26 elements , such as gd .",
    "moreover , the backscattering energy for light elements is low causing the signal to become convoluted with that from the substrate , as seen in the main plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : rbs ] . the @xmath27he energy",
    "was therefore tuned to 4.3 mev , where @xmath27he undergoes a nuclear resonance elastic scattering with c , thus increasing the backscattering cross - section of c and enhancing the c signal by a factor of @xmath1010 , shown as the sharp peak in the fig .",
    "[ fig : rbs ] insert .",
    "this technique measures the film composition with greater accuracy , and is essential to the quantitative study of any gd concentration - dependent properties , such as the metal - insulator ( m - i ) transition or film magnetization .",
    "the h content in the _ a_-gd - c : h films was measured by hydrogen forward scattering(hfs ) .",
    "the hfs samples were capped with a thin silver layer in order to separate the h signal in the sample from the signal of hydrocarbon contamination on the film surface .",
    "the hydrogen yields were calibrated with a kapton sheet . for ( 95%ar:5%h@xmath18)/ar gas flow ratio up",
    "to 10 % , h incorporation was about 5 at.% ( _ _ a-__c@xmath28:h@xmath29 ) and was not very sensitive to the ratio .",
    "films were also prepared with the pure mixture 95%ar:5%h@xmath18 gas introduced at the targets , which caused noticeable changes in the bonding structure indicated by raman spectrum discussed below .",
    "the hfs experiment was not performed on these samples , but the h at.% concentration was estimated to be high , @xmath1020 at.% ( _ _ a-__c@xmath14:h@xmath30 ) based on raman spectroscopy in the literature . despite this high h concentration , the pure _ a_-c : h films were still very scratch resistant , as were the gd - doped films which had a metallic appearance , showing no visible sign of polymerization .",
    "raman spectroscopy is widely used to obtain information on @xmath5 and @xmath6 bonding in amorphous carbon films  @xcite .",
    "disordered carbon systems have two raman active modes when excited with a 488 nm excitation laser : one at 1580 @xmath31 of @xmath32 symmetry , labelled ` g ' ; the other at 1350 @xmath31 of @xmath33 symmetry , labelled ` d ' .",
    "both modes correspond to the @xmath5 bonding , but are related to different atomic arrangement of the @xmath5 sites .",
    "the g mode is the stretching vibration of any pair of @xmath5-bonded sites , whether in chains or in rings , while the d mode is the collective breathing mode of the @xmath5 sites in 6-member graphitic rings , thus only related to disordered graphitic sites .",
    "depending on the @xmath5 fraction and arrangement ( whether in chains or in graphitic rings ) , the relative peak intensity , the peak position and the peak width of the two raman modes will change accordingly .",
    "as @xmath5 sites evolve towards @xmath6 sites , the ratio of the d peak intensity to the g peak intensity ( @xmath34 ) decreases monotonically  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath6 sites start to nucleate , @xmath35 corresponding to graphitic bonds becomes negligible and the remaining @xmath5 sites arrange mainly in chains .",
    "figure  [ fig : ramanc ] shows the raman spectra for different types of amorphous carbon films , prepared by different growth methods ( with and without h ) .",
    "we indeed observe two peaks , one centered at @xmath101390 @xmath31 ( the d peak ) and the other centered at @xmath101550 @xmath31 ( the g peak ) . as the h concentration in the film",
    "is increased , the @xmath34 ratio decreases , indicating that h opens up the graphitic rings and helps to form @xmath5-bonded carbon chains as expected from the literature . the width ( full width half maximum from gaussian peak fit ) of the g peak , which scales with disorder , is 140 - 150 @xmath31 corresponding to a in - plane correlation length @xmath36 less than 0.1 nm  @xcite , further assuring the amorphous nature of the matrix .",
    "we compare our sputtered _",
    "a_-c@xmath37(:h@xmath38 ) samples to a tetrahedral amorphous carbon film ( denoted as _",
    "ta_-c , with predominant @xmath6-bonding ) prepared by energetic vacuum cathodic - arc deposition ( the top curve in fig .  [ fig : ramanc ] ) .",
    "a symmetric g peak with no sign of d peak indicates that there are no graphitic rings but only short @xmath5-bonded chains remaining in a @xmath6-dominant _ ta_-c matrix .",
    "even though the @xmath5 sites are a small fraction of the @xmath6 sites in _ ta_-c , they still show a large g peak signal because the raman cross - section for the @xmath39 bond is much larger than the @xmath40 bond in @xmath6 . according to the three - stage model proposed by ferrari  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath5 fraction of our _ a_-c(:h ) is about 90@xmath10100% , typical for films prepared by sputtering .",
    "the incorporation of h changes the morphology of the matrix towards more `` diamond - like '' with less graphitic ring sites and @xmath6 sites would have been stablized if a more energetic deposition method was used .",
    "figure  [ fig : ramangdc3 ] shows the gd influence on the _",
    "a_-c(:h ) structure .",
    "although no changes were visible in the hr - xtem micrographs as the gd doping was increased ( always amorphous and no clustering ) , there is a dramatic change of the @xmath5 bonding order . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ramangdc3 ] , the @xmath34 ratio increases greatly with gd concentration at first and then decreases . starting as a low but broad shoulder next to the g peak in an undoped _",
    "a_-c(:h ) , the d peak developes into a major raman peak when gd concentration increases .",
    "in contrast to the h incorporation which makes the _",
    "a_-c more `` diamond - like '' , gd favors the formation of graphitic @xmath5 sites . after the @xmath34 ratio reaches a maximum , it decreases slightly with the gd concentration , but is still very large ( @xmath41 ) compared to literature values which are @xmath422.5  @xcite .",
    "the g peak width decreases after doping but is still broad ( 90 - 110 @xmath31 , @xmath431 nm ) .",
    "these features were observed in both the hydrogenated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ramangdc3](a ) ) and h - free ( fig .",

    "this structural change has a large consequence on the film transport properties as discussed later .",
    "the dc conductivity ( @xmath44 ) and magneto - transport as a function of temperature ( @xmath45 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath46 ) was measured for the _ a_-gd - c(:h ) alloys .",

    "this data is representative of all _",
    "a_-gd@xmath14c@xmath2(:h@xmath38 ) samples since they behave magnetically the same .",
    "a split was observed between susceptibility curves measured after field - cooled ( @xmath65 ) and after zero - field - cooled ( @xmath66 ) , indicating spin - glass freezing , as previouly seen and extensively discussed in _ a_-gd - si alloys  @xcite .",
    "the spin - glass states are a result of competing ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions in disordered materials .",
    "since the _ f _ shell of gd is very tightly bound to the nuclei , direct interaction between the gd moments is very unlikely .",
    "a rkky ( ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ) interaction was found in metallic gd and gdsi@xmath18 thus an indirect mediated rkky - like exchange is likely the dominant interaction causing spin - glass freezing of our _ a_-gd - c(:h ) alloys .",

    "gd dopants could introduce large local defects ( e.g. voids ) and lead to less dense _",

    "the @xmath34 ratio first increases and then decreases , peaking at the same gd concentration where @xmath48 reaches its maximum for both _ a_-gd - c and _ a_-gd - c : h . samples with the highest @xmath44 have the largest @xmath34 ratio , indicating more disordered graphitic ring sites .",

    "the increasing gd at.% and graphitic ring sites both contribute to the increasing @xmath44 .",
    "however , the graphitic ring sites start to decrease after reaching the threshold doping and the matrix becomes less conducting .",
    "this compensates the doping effect of gd and is responsible for the decreasing overall @xmath44 .",
    "turning now to the magneto - transport properties , there are few theoretical models to describe the large negative mr in magnetically - doped disordered electronic systems .",
    "the bound magnetic polaron ( bmp ) model was used to explain the negative mr in doped crystalline semiconductor systems such as cd@xmath2mn@xmath14se  @xcite and gd@xmath84s@xmath85  @xcite .",
    "our system however , has a much higher ratio of carriers to magnetic dopant sites compared to the above systems ( of order 1:1 vs. 1:10@xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , bmp is not a relevant model .",
    "instead we turn to an anderson localization type model to explain the negative mr .",
    "the interaction between carriers and the randomly oriented gd moments provides additional magnetic disorder to the structural disorder thus increasing the localization of the hopping carriers .",
