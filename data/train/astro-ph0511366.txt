    "the infall of compact objects into black holes ( bhs ) is of considerable interest in many branches of astrophysics . in particular , many of the arguments that can be made about coalescing neutron star - neutron star ( nsns ) binaries also apply to coalescing black hole - neutron star ( bhns ) binaries .",
    "both are strong candidates for the central engines of short - duration gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , since the merger timescale following tidal disruption is comparable to the grb duration and the gravitational binding energies provide the characteristic energy scales inferred by observers @xcite .",
    "it is possible that any ejected matter may contribute significantly to the r - process elemental abundance of the universe @xcite .",
    "additionally , they are expected to be among the most important sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) that can be detected by both terrestrial laser interferometers such as ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo @xcite , and tama @xcite , as well as the proposed space - based interferometer lisa @xcite .",
    "the key difference between the sources that can be observed with ligo ( and comparable detectors ) and lisa is the characteristic frequency of the gw emission : lisa s characteristic frequency range falls within @xmath1 , whereas ligo operates between @xmath2 . because of this , ligo is most sensitive to the mergers of stellar - mass bhs , whereas lisa will observe more massive merging systems that involve either intermediate mass bhs ( imbhs ) , @xmath3 , or supermassive bhs ( smbhs ) , @xmath4 .",
    "the formation history leading to these encounters is likely to involve completely different processes .",
    "compact binaries with stellar - mass bhs are likely to be formed through typical stellar binary evolution , at rates that depend on parameters such as the binary mass ratio distribution , common - envelope efficiency , and the physics of supernova kicks , all of which remain somewhat uncertain ( see @xcite and references therein for a thorough review ) . the mass distribution of bhs in such systems is poorly constrained , as none have been observed to date , but may vary widely , spanning a range @xmath5 @xcite . for sufficiently tight binaries , merger will occur within a hubble time . in these cases , the dissipative effects of gravitational radiation will cause the orbit to circularize as the binary separation shrinks , so that the eccentricity of the orbit is expected to be almost zero by the time the binary enters the ligo band . whether or not the compact object is tidally disrupted by its bh companion , as well as where this would occur in the latter case with respect to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , depends on both the compaction of the compact object and the mass ratio ( see section [ sec : physical ] )",
    ".    this simple picture does not apply to compact objects orbiting bhs with considerably higher mass .",
    "both imbhs and smbhs are expected to reside within stellar clusters , whose dynamics will be determined by both stellar - bh and stellar - stellar gravitational encounters ( scattering ) .",
    "some stars will typically be scattered , either strongly or weakly , into the `` loss cone '' , i.e. , the volume of phase space encompassing orbits with sufficiently small periastrons that the star will be tidally disrupted before being kicked into another orbit by future encounters ( see @xcite for a review of the original derivations , and @xcite for more recent work ) . as a result , most objects that enter the loss cone do so at very high eccentricity , with periastron distances of @xmath6 schwarzschild radii @xcite . in many cases",
    ", these systems will approach the bh with eccentricities @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "gw detections from coalescence with higher mass bhs may yield very little information about the physics of ns matter , for the case of a ns falling into an imbh , or any compact object ( bh , ns , or white dwarf ) falling into an smbh with @xmath8 .",
    "these objects should plunge through the isco of the bh intact , since the tidal - disruption radius lies _ within _ the isco , and will likely be swallowed whole by the bh . for the opposite case , applicable to white dwarfs ( wd ) falling into imbhs ( and nss into stellar - mass bhs ) , tidal disruption will occur outside the isco , a process we describe in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : physical ] .    for the vast majority of its lifetime",
    ", a stellar - mass compact object binary will inspiral very slowly , such that it can be described by a point - mass , post - newtonian ( pn ) treatment .",
    "pn formalisms for the adiabatic inspiral epoch are now completely determined up to 3.5pn order @xcite , and include lowest - order spin - orbit and spin - spin terms @xcite .",
    "once finite - size and tidal effects become important at close separation , it becomes necessary to solve the fully nonlinear einstein field equations .",
    "quasi - equilibrium binary configurations in circular orbits have been calculated in gr for nsns @xcite , bhns ( see @xcite , hereafter bss ; @xcite , hereafter tbfs , and references therein ) , and bhbh binaries ( @xcite ; for a thorough review of the topic and references , see @xcite ) .",
    "details of the transition from slow inspiral to rapid plunge , and deviations from the point - mass energy versus frequency relation found in quasi - equilibrium sequences , may yield important information about the physical parameters of the ns equation of state ( eos ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that a combination of @xmath9 broadband and narrowband observations of nsns mergers might be able to constrain the ns radius to within a few percent .",
    "we will show below that bhns mergers may be just as interesting , but it is likely that the interpretation of physical features in the gw signal will be significantly more complicated , since differences between stable and unstable modes of mass transfer may lead to radically different scenarios .",
    "eventually , for those systems in which the tidal limit is reached before the isco , mass transfer onto the bh will begin .",
    "this process is fundamentally dynamic in nature , and can only be modeled accurately by relativistic , three - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "attempts have been made to model these systems analytically , but as we will show below , the conclusions rely on a number of unphysical assumptions .",
    "the earliest work describing mass transfer in detail for compact object binary mergers @xcite assumed that mass transfer in nsns binaries would conserve both mass and orbital angular momentum , and that both nss would remain on a quasi - circular orbit in corotation during the evolution ; a similar set of assumptions was used to describe bhns binaries as a possible source of gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "a more complex treatment developed in @xcite drops the assumption of circularity , since it is not seen to hold in numerical calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "still , their model for the evolution of bhns systems undergoing mass transfer depends on a number of ad hoc assumptions that need to be tested by dynamical calculations in order to be proven valid .    beyond uncertainties about the form of the late - inspiral gw signal produced by a bhns merger , there remains the question of the event rate , which remains uncertain given the complete lack of detection of such systems to date .",
    "still , it is possible to estimate the likely merger rate using population synthesis models , which can be calibrated against the observed galactic nsns binary population and supernova rates .",
    "recent estimates predict an advanced ligo annual detection rate of anywhere from a few mergers @xcite up to potentially several hundred @xcite .",
    "should a bhns binary merger be observed , it might reveal a great deal about the physics of matter at nuclear densities .",
    "in particular , the onset of mass transfer would yield a clear indication about the ns radius , and , as we will explain in detail below , the stability of the mass transfer would yield important information as to the nuclear eos .",
    "whereas for nsns binaries the characteristic frequencies of gw emission during the merger and formation of a remnant ( either a hypermassive ns or bh ) will typically occur at frequencies outside the peak sensitivity of even an advanced ligo detector , the same is not true for bhns binaries . since the frequency at the onset of instability scales roughly inversely with the total binary mass ,",
    "we expect stellar - mass bhns mergers to occur at characteristic frequencies at which ligo will be most sensitive , @xmath10 .",
    "if the gw signal from a merger was observed to be coincident with a short - duration gamma - ray burst , we could potentially determine their distance , luminosity , and characteristic beaming angle @xcite .",
    "a detailed theoretical understanding of these systems is now more urgent than ever , in light of the recent localizations of short grb afterglows @xcite , the first ever for these systems ( many long - duration grbs have been localized , but are believed to be the result of collapsing stars , not merging compact binaries ) .",
    "unfortunately , the current state - of - the - art for hydrodynamic calculations of bhns inspiral and merger is far behind that for nsns mergers .",
    "calculations of the latter have been performed using a variety of newtonian , pn , and relativistic gravitational formalisms ( see , @xcite for thorough reviews , and @xcite , hereafter fgr , for a more recent summary ) .",
    "many calculations have now been performed in either the conformal flatness ( cf ) approximation to general relativity ( gr ) @xcite , or in full gr @xcite .",
    "these gr calculations now include sophisticated treatments of the ns eos and physically appropriate initial spins ( @xcite ; nss are expected to be nearly irrotational in the inertial frame , since the viscous timescale is much longer than the inspiral timescale , see @xcite and sec .",
    "[ sec : physical ] below ) .",
    "the key difficulty that must be overcome to perform simulations of relativistic bhns mergers is the same one that arises in the study of bhbh binaries ; the presence of a spacetime singularity inside the black hole . to avoid encountering the singularity in a numerical simulation",
    ", the bh interior is excised from the computational grid in most current applications .",
    "this is justified by the fact that no information can propagate from the bh interior to the exterior , so the exterior can be evolved independently of the interior .",
    "while progress has been reported , especially very recently @xcite , black hole evolution calculations have been plagued by numerical instabilities . in some ways ,",
    "bhns mergers are even more difficult to evolve consistently , since both the singular behavior of the bh as well as the hydrodynamic nature of the ns must be confronted . whereas the bhbh problem involves a pure vacuum solution of the einstein field equations , the ns must always be evolved in such a way that the relativistic fluid is treated properly .    as a result of these difficulties ,",
    "all hydrodynamic calculations performed to date of stellar - mass bhns mergers have used newtonian or quasi - newtonian gravitational treatments @xcite .",
    "needless to say , binaries containing a bh can be evolved accurately only by using relativistic hydrodynamics in a relativistic spacetime .",
    "we emphasize here that this applies both to the tidal field created by the bh , as well as the self - gravity of the ns .",
    "previous newtonian calculations have in some cases @xcite used an approximate black hole potential , suggested in @xcite , that creates an isco at @xmath11 , but no single static potential can generate the full set of relativistic forces experienced by matter in the strong - field regime .",
    "calculations employing a fixed background bh metric have typically been performed for stars undergoing a tidal interaction with a massive bh , rather than a stellar - mass bh , with relativistic dynamical terms but a newtonian treatment of the self - gravity .",
    "the secondary , in fact , is often assumed to be a white dwarf or main - sequence star .",
    "these models include sph treatments without self - gravity @xcite , and both ppm @xcite and spectral method @xcite treatments with newtonian self - gravity .",
    "more recently , sph techniques have been devised that evolve the ns matter in the background metric of a stellar - mass bh , using newtonian - order correction to model the ns self - gravity , for both sph @xcite and characteristic gravity @xcite .",
    "this approach is appropriate for describing main - sequence stars or white dwarfs .",
    "however , since the tidal disruption is a result of a competition between the black hole tidal force and stellar self - gravity , this approach is not sufficient to describe bhns binaries accurately .",
    "modeling tidal disruption in bhns binaries requires a relativistic treatment of both the black hole and the neutron star .    here",
    ", we will make use of the cf approximation to gr , introduced by isenberg @xcite and wilson and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the cf approximation amounts to assuming that the spatial metric remains conformally flat , so that the gravitational fields can be found by solving the constraint equations of gr , decomposed in the conformal thin - sandwich ( cts ) decomposition @xcite , alone .",
    "the cts formalism has been used in numerous applications to construct initial data describing both nsns and bhns binaries in quasiequilibrium @xcite . for these initial data",
    "the choice of a conformal background metric is completely consistent with einstein s initial value ( constraint ) field equations , although different choices may describe the astrophysical situation at hand more or less accurately .",
    "the situation is different for dynamical simulations in the cf approximation ( e.g.  @xcite ) , since the assumption that the spatial metric _ remains _ conformally flat is no longer strictly consistent with einstein s field evolution equations . for many applications",
    ", however , cf provides an excellent approximation . for spherically symmetric configurations , as an example",
    ", the cf approach is exact , and for many other applications the error has been shown to be in the order of at most a few percent ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is particularly useful for exploring dynamical behavior , e.g. , collapse or tidal break - up , which occurs on dynamical timescales and is unaltered by secular effects like gravitational radiation - reaction .    in this paper",
    "we present the dynamical extension of bss , who calculated the first relativistic , quasiequilibrium bhns sequences as solutions of the cts decomposition of the einstein field equations . modifying their code to treat the metric for the schwarzschild bh in isotropic ( cf )",
    "coordinates , rather than the kerr - schild coordinates reported in bss , we take their corotating quasiequilibrium configurations as initial data . as in bss",
    ", we assume an extreme mass ratio , @xmath12 , which allows us to hold the bh position fixed and restrict the computational grid to a neighborhood of the ns , thereby avoiding complications arising in the bh interior .",
    "we also assume a polytropic equation of state for the neutron star , as well as synchronous rotation .",
    "the resulting dynamical calculations are the first of their kind to solve the cts field equations for the spacetime around the ns self - consistently by treating both the ns and bh relativistically .",
    "they allow us to study details of the dynamical mass - transfer process , particularly its stability .",
    "the cf approximation holds a stable equilibrium configuration constructed in the cts formalism in strict dynamical equilibrium .",
    "our calculation is a prototype of more detailed general relativistic calculations we hope to provide in the future that will involve irrotational ns models with more realistic eoss and compactions , arbitrary mass ratios , and a fully self - consistent treatment of the spatial metric .    in the cf approximation",
    ", gravitational radiation reaction must be added in by hand in order to drive the system toward merger .",
    "while it is the secular energy losses to gravitational radiation that initially drive the binary system toward the point of tidal disruption , they play a much reduced role in the dynamics thereafter .",
    "indeed , while secular forces determine the path the binary takes prior to merger , the merger itself is a fundamentally dynamical process , as we discuss in great detail below .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : physical ] we discuss the important physical scales that define our problem , and present a detailed treatment of the traditional picture for determining the stability of mass transfer .",
    "we then discuss the limitations of this model , and explain why it may not be applicable for bhns mergers . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] we describe our numerical methods , including the details of both our implementation of the cf field equations as well as our use of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) techniques to evolve the fluid configuration . in sec .",
    "[ sec : equil ] we compare our relaxed initial data to previous quasiequilibrium models , and find that we can construct configurations that satisfy the field equations to high accuracy while reproducing previous results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamical ] we present our simulations of merging binaries for different models of the ns polytropic eos . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss our results in the context of gw astrophysics , and describe our plans for further calculations .",
    "the evolution of binaries containing nss is a fully relativistic problem , since lowest - order pn approximations break down in the strong gravitational fields present during late stages of the merger .",
    "however , we can use information from newtonian and quasi - newtonian calculations to estimate the various timescales and physical regimes we expect to encounter .",
    "thus , we first classify the relevant physical scales we expect to encounter in our study of bhns binary evolution , and then generalize the standard model for stable , binary mass transfer to relativistic stars . in doing so",
    ", we will explain why this model , variants of which have been used previously to describe the evolution of compact binaries , is unlikely to apply to bhns mergers .",
    "our simple mass - transfer model does have physical relevance , as it can apply to the case of a wd inspiraling in a nearly circular fashion toward an imbh in a globular cluster .",
    "such a star will begin transferring mass long before reaching the isco .",
    "however , since wds are typically kicked into highly eccentric orbits prior to interactions with the bh , the orbit may not have time to circularize fully before the onset of mass transfer .",
    "in such cases , the binary evolution will be more complicated than the scenario we consider here ; it has been studied before by several groups ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the four most important timescales characterizing the problem at hand are the ns dynamical timescale @xmath13 , the viscous timescale @xmath14 , the orbital timescale @xmath15 , and the gw radiation - reaction timescale @xmath16 . throughout this paper , we set @xmath17 .",
    "the bh and ns masses can be written in terms of the initial mass ratio @xmath18 as @xmath19 or equivalently @xmath20 , and the ns radius @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the compactness parameter .",
    "the dynamical timescale of the ns is given by @xmath23 we wish to compare this with the orbital and radiation - reaction timescales at the radius where roche - lobe overflow will begin . to estimate this radius",
    ", we will use the approximate form proposed in @xcite , @xmath24 which gives the ( volume - averaged ) roche - lobe radius as a function of the mass ratio and binary separation @xmath25 , for a binary treated as a pair of point masses in the corotating frame .",
    "this definition differs from the original definition of the roche lobe , which was defined for incompressible matter ( point masses are in effect infinitely compressible ) , but the physical scalings are the same ; the coefficient becomes @xmath26 for incompressible matter instead of @xmath27 .",
    "the roche - lobe radius is equal to the ns radius at a separation @xmath28 at which point the ( keplerian ) orbital period is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total binary mass , and the last relation holds for @xmath31 , or equivalently , @xmath32 .",
    "we note that in this limit , the orbital period is a fixed multiple of the ns dynamical timescale , regardless of the properties of the ns .    for a point - mass binary on a circular orbit , lowest order radiation reaction predicts that the binary will inspiral , losing energy and angular momentum , on a characteristic timescale @xmath33 given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the coalescence time , i.e. , the remaining time until the point - mass binary would reach @xmath36 . at the roche - lobe separation , assuming @xmath31 , we have @xmath37 in general , the radiation - reaction timescale will be at least an order of magnitude longer than the dynamical timescale for any binary which begins mass transfer outside the isco radius .",
    "the orbital period @xmath15 , however , may become similar to the coalescence time @xmath33 , indicating that the infall becomes quite rapid .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : qc ] , we show the regions in parameter space for which the critical separation for roche - lobe overflow lies within or outside of the isco , for a wide variety of compact object - bh binaries . dashed vertical lines correspond to the approximate compactness of either a wd or a ns , whereas dotted horizontal lines show the approximate mass ratios to be expected for a @xmath38 stellar - mass bh , an imbh , or a smbh .",
    "systems above the critical curve reach the tidal limit before the isco , and are likely to transfer mass onto the bh .",
    "for those sufficiently below the curve , we expect that the compact object will pass through the isco intact , and plunge onto the bh relatively intact .",
    "=    we note however , that this simple picture may very well be altered by a number of more complicated effects .",
    "recently , miller @xcite has argued that even if systems are expected to reach the mass - shedding limit prior to crossing the isco , in many cases they will have already begun to plunge .",
    "indeed , since the binary energy as a function of separation flattens out significantly near the isco , @xmath39 , which is already nearly of order @xmath15 , will systematically underestimate the infall velocity ( a similar argument was used in @xcite to argue that the gw energy spectrum produced in nsns mergers declines dramatically near the isco ) . because of this , the isco may _ systematically underestimate _ the binary separation at which prompt merger becomes inevitable .    on the other hand , describing the `` plunge '' of an extended object like",
    "a ns may provide a misleading picture of the dynamical merger in cases where the tidal disruption occurs inside the isco but outside the horizon .",
    "while it is certain that some matter , likely a significant fraction of the ns mass , will plunge inward directly onto the bh , this may liberate a great deal of angular momentum into the outer parts of the ns @xcite . as a result",
    ", some fraction of the mass may survive the plunge , at least initially , in the form of a `` mini - ns '' , which will escape outside the isco on an elliptical orbit .",
    "needless to say , only dynamical calculations will clarify the role played by these competing effects .",
    "the final timescale we must consider is the viscous damping timescale @xmath40 , which we expect to play a crucial role in determining the fate of the binary once mass transfer commences . in the limit that the viscous timescale is extremely short ( high viscosity ) , we expect two important phenomena to occur .",
    "first , tidal dissipation can synchronize the binary so that the secondary is corotating upon the onset of mass transfer . from @xcite , we note that a binary will be synchronized by the time mass transfer begins only if @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the ratio of the light crossing time of the secondary to its viscous timescale , as defined by @xcite .",
    "if we follow @xcite and assume that turbulent viscosity is the primary damping mechanism , we can define @xmath43 , the turbulent viscosity parameter , so that @xmath44 we see that synchronization will occur if @xmath45 on fig .",
    "[ fig : qc ] , we show curves marking the critical mass ratio - compactness dependence for @xmath46 , which we define as the `` causal limit '' , as well as for @xmath47 , which is the maximum plausible value for turbulent viscosity in physical systems of interest @xcite .",
    "configurations to the left of the curve can synchronize before merger ; this includes essentially all mergers where the secondary is either an ms star or a wd .",
    "ns mergers , on the other hand , will be irrotational in general , especially when the primary is a bh , since the required viscosity to synchronize the ns increases as the primary mass increases @xcite .",
    "viscosity should also play a role after mass transfer starts , as we will discuss in detail below .",
    "once the secondary fills its roche lobe , it will begin to transfer mass onto its companion .",
    "such a process can be either stable or unstable , depending on its response to mass loss .",
    "if the volume of the roche lobe shrinks faster than ( or expands slower than ) the stellar radius , the process is unstable , and the star will typically be disrupted violently .",
    "on the other hand , if a small amount of mass loss causes the star to shrink back within the roche lobe , it is possible for the mass loss to temporarily cease , or at the very least settle down to a much smaller equilibrium level , whose value can be determined based on the assumptions made about conservation of mass and angular momentum , as we discuss below .",
    "we first note that models of stable mass transfer typically assume that the binary orbit remains quasicircular , which in turn is only possible if the viscous timescale is short relative to the orbital and gw timescales . maintaining a circular orbit",
    "requires that the orbital energy evolve according to a fixed relation in terms of the orbital angular momentum and the mass of the secondary , but there is no reason to assume that such a relation should hold _ a priori_. indeed , it is viscous dissipation that drives the orbit toward circularity , by converting excess orbital energy into other forms",
    ". furthermore , when the viscous timescale is long , the mass - transfer rate can grow extremely rapidly , since the inner lagrange point travels into the secondary at roughly @xmath48 , unbinding progressively denser material from the ns .",
    "if this leads to an unstable runaway , it is the mass loss that drives the orbital evolution , and we expect to find the development of an orbital eccentricity .",
    "this violates the typical assumptions made in conservative mass - transfer models , which assume that mass loss is steady , and slow enough that the orbit can remain circular as mass is lost .",
    "the early attempt to follow the mass transfer process in detail for nsns binaries was provided by @xcite , who modeled the heavier ns as a point mass , and the lighter secondary using an eos that yields a nearly flat mass - radius relation down to @xmath49 , below which the ns begins to expand rapidly with further decreasing mass . rather than assume conservative mass transfer , they parameterized the possible loss of both mass and angular momentum from the system , finding that the former has very little effect on their results",
    ". in their model , mass transfer leads to a widening of the binary orbit , under the condition that the ns radius must equal the radius of its roche lobe . as mentioned above",
    ", this will only hold for systems in which @xmath50 . over time",
    ", the mass loss rate and gw luminosity decrease rapidly from their large initial values at closest approach ( as does the rate of neutrino production as the ns matter decompresses during the transfer ) , until eventually the low - mass ns begins to expand rapidly @xcite and unstable mass transfer begins .",
    "many of these ideas were revisited for a discussion of bhns binaries in @xcite , in light of the optical identification of grb counterparts at cosmological distances . assuming a newtonian @xmath51 polytropic eos and fully conservative mass transfer , they find that the initial mass - transfer rate between a @xmath52 ns and a bh with mass @xmath53 will occur at a rate of @xmath54 for approximately @xmath55 before decaying away according to the approximate power - law relation @xmath56 , which corresponds to @xmath57 . as in @xcite",
    ", they assume that the process will terminate when the ns reaches a critical minimum mass and begins to expand unstably .    the most recent treatment of bhns coalescence makes a completely different set of assumptions about the dynamics during mass transfer .",
    "based on the newtonian bhns numerical calculations of rosswog , speith , and wynn @xcite , davies , levan , and king @xcite assume that the rapid timescale for mass transfer will violate the assumption of circular orbits , which underlies the typical conservative , quasiequilibrium mass - transfer formulation .",
    "instead , they make the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "mass transfer occurs during a timescale corresponding to half an orbit .",
    "2 .   during this time period ,",
    "the ns , treated as a uniform density sphere , will lose mass from a shell whose depth is a distance equivalent to the infall rate from the beginning of the mass - transfer rate multiplied by half an orbital period .",
    "3 .   half of the angular momentum lost to the transferred mass will return to the ns , placing it on an eccentric orbit that will typically not lead to overflow during the next periastron passage .",
    "this model does reproduce well the extremely high mass loss rates initially seen during newtonian numerical calculations of bhns mergers @xcite , but the assumptions adopted are somewhat ad hoc .",
    "in particular , transferring angular momentum back to the ns without adjusting its mass causes a discontinuous evolution of the binary orbit . in some cases ,",
    "the ns will find itself on an orbit whose _ periastron _ is outside the mass - shedding limit , leading to a period of stable evolution until gw dissipation forces the orbit to decay inward again back to the onset of mass transfer . in contrast , we find below that mass transfer can be quenched temporarily , but from this point on the ns follows an elliptical trajectory that will take it back within the mass - shedding limit prior to the next periastron passage .",
    "in appendix  [ appendix : masstransfer ] , we derive a semi - analytic formulation for _ conservative _ mass transfer onto a bh , modeling secondaries either by a newtonian or a relativistic polytrope .",
    "we recover the scaling relations found in @xcite , and generalize them for arbitrary polytropic indices . although these relations are unlikely to hold for merging bhns systems , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : qc ] , the newtonian results can be applied to merging wds as well as main sequence stars undergoing mass transfer .",
    "we note that there are semi - analytic formalisms for describing _ non - conservative _ mass transfer as well ( see , e.g. @xcite for a formalism involving mass transfer from a main sequence star onto a companion ) , and that these have been useful in describing wdbh mergers @xcite , but that the actual ns tidal disruption process is sufficiently dynamic that essentially all analytic treatments break down .",
    "the theory of accretion disk dynamics presents several interesting connections to that of merging binaries , since questions about the stability of mass transfer appear as well ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one key difference between the models is the typical radial angular momentum distribution ; parameterizing the tangential velocity profile as @xmath58 , irrotational ns have a nearly flat velocity profile , @xmath59 , and corotating ns a flat angular velocity profile , @xmath60 , both larger than the keplerian value @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , ns differ greatly from disks because of their infall velocity when they pass through the isco , and their strong self - gravity . while angular momentum distributions with larger values of @xmath62 help to stabilize mass transfer in disks , stronger self - gravity destabilizes mass transfer @xcite .",
    "thus , it is hard to generalize across the classes , although we note that irrotational ns should , if anything , be more prone to unstable mass transfer , as the ns loses more angular momentum per unit mass lost from its inner edge .",
    "to compute the dynamical evolution of a bhns binary , we fix the position of the bh and assume that the surrounding spacetime metric takes the form appropriate to a nonspinning schwarzschild bh .",
    "the approximation of a fixed bh position is correct in the limit that @xmath63 . here , we will study binaries with mass ratios @xmath64 , which is presumably within the range of values for which the approximation of an extreme mass ratio is valid .    to calculate gravitational forces and evolve the fluid configuration",
    ", we will work within the cf formalism , which we explain in more detail in section [ sec : cf ] below .",
    "we assume that the spatial metric is remains conformally flat , so that it can be written in the form @xmath65 where @xmath62 and @xmath66 are the lapse function and shift vector , respectively . under this assumption",
    "we only need to solve the @xmath67 constraint equations for @xmath68 , @xmath62 and @xmath66 to determine the metric .",
    "our initial configuration places the ns in a _ corotating _ initial configuration .",
    "irrotational configurations , which are more realistic astrophysically , will be treated in a later publication .",
    "we model the nss as relativistic polytropes , and assume adiabatic evolution , which we describe in detail in sec .",

    "first , the asymptotic schwarzschild bh contribution to the spacetime metric is held fixed , allowing us to solve the field equations describing the self - gravity of the ns in a fully consistent way .",
    "second , as discussed below , we solve poisson - like elliptic equations for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , as in bss and elsewhere , rather than for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , as in fgr and related treatments ( tbfs denotes the latter quantity `` @xmath72 '' ) .",
    "third , we restrict the spatial domain of our spectral methods field solver to a finite radius centered on the ns , as was done in bss and tbfs , which allows us to avoid problems near the bh .",
    "indeed , our computational domain is chosen so as not to overlap the event horizon at any time . as a result , we do not make use of the asymptotic boundary conditions typically used by lorene - based codes , which can be extended to spatial infinity through the proper coordinate transformations @xcite .",
    "the use of a restricted spatial domain has been introduced before , in the context of domains with ingoing and outgoing gws @xcite , but with a set of bc s that are not appropriate to the ( elliptic ) problem at hand . instead , as we describe below ,",
    "we have introduced a multipole expansion bc , used here and in tbfs , which should be more accurate than the lowest - order power - law falloff conditions traditionally used in grid - based calculations .",
    "below , we first summarize the relevant equations that comprise relativistic hydrodynamics ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hydro ] ) and the cf formalism ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cf ] ) , introduce the `` split '' equations which factor out the bh contributions to the spacetime in sec .",
    "[ sec : bhnssplit ] , describe our new approach for introducing a multipole bc in sec .",
    "[ sec : multipole ] , and finally describe how this affects the evaluation of various quantities in the sph evolution equations sec .",
    "[ sec : sph ] .",
    "we assume that the matter can be described as a perfect fluid so that the stress - energy tensor takes the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 denote the rest mass density , specific internal energy , pressure , and 4-velocity , respectively .",
    "we will describe the ns by a relativistic polytropic eos that evolves adiabatically with index @xmath78 .",
    "hence , the pressure obeys the relation @xmath79 and initially satisfies @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant . as discussed in bss , we can scale away dimensional units by setting @xmath82 ( see their sec .",

    "for an adiabatic evolution without shock heating , the energy equation is satisfied automatically by adopting eq .",
    "( [ eq : polyinit ] ) .    to account for shocks",
    ", we included an artificial viscosity prescription composed of both linear and quadratic terms ( the relativistic analogue of the form introduced in @xcite , similar to that found in @xcite ) .",
    "we found no evidence for significant shocks within the body of the ns , as only the matter in the mass transfer stream directed toward the bh showed signs of significant heating very near the bh . using the value of @xmath95 as a measure , a quantity that remains constant during an adiabatic evolution , we found variation of no more than @xmath96 within the body of the ns .",
    "this is hardly a surprise , as there is no physical mechanism such as a collision to cause significant shocking within the bulk of the ns .",
    "shock heating will be important for understanding the evolution of the initially low - density accretion stream that falls toward the bh , especially near the event horizon . in this region ,",

    "( [ eq : polyinit ] ) , throughout the calculations described here . in future calculations , where shocks may be more important , we will restore the full evolution of the energy equation with an artificial viscosity prescription and allow for shocks everywhere .",
    "this will be especially important for irrotational ns calculations , since the matter transferring through the inner lagrange point has significantly greater angular momentum than in the irrotational case , and a great deal of it will likely forming a disk rather than accreting promptly .",
    "in the cf formalism @xcite we assume that the spatial metric is not only conformally flat initially , but that it remains conformally flat .",

    "the approach we use has several advantages over the leading order power - law falloff bc s typically used in bss and other grid - based field calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "first , we lose less information about the source terms by extending to higher order multipoles ( @xcite include dipole order falloff terms for the lapse and conformal factor in full gr , while @xcite include quadrupole - order terms for these in cf gravity ) .",
    "moreover , we avoid a problem associated with symmetries present in our quasi - equilibrium initial conditions which are broken during the dynamical evolution .",

    "while these terms are growing , we are faced with a situation where the leading - order term may very well not be the largest magnitude multipole contribution on the boundary . defining a global power - law falloff index to fit the boundary condition . as in previous treatments , is impossible even when the two lowest - order moments are known , since the index varies with angle .",

    ", it persists in configurations for which the roche lobe lies within the star , and mass loss continues until the ns is completely disrupted .",
    "we plan to improve our simulations and relax several approximations in the near future .",
    "in particular we plan to adopt the astrophysically more realistic _ irrotational _ initial configuration of tbfs instead of the corotating configurations used here .",
    "relativistic nsns @xcite and newtonian bhns @xcite calculations have shown that for these cases the amount of matter ejected from the binary system is expected to be significantly smaller , since the material on the outer edge of the ns has significantly less specific angular momentum .",
    "thus , while we expect that bhns mergers will expel more material than in the case of nsnss , in which the binary components are more comparable in mass , we would assume that the ejected fractions found here are overestimates .",
    "calculating mergers using irrotational nss should also increase the probability that escaping matter forms an accretion disk around the bh , even if that disk is short - lived ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we typically found in our calculations here that most of the matter transferred toward the bh ends up accreting onto it directly , since the specific angular momentum is not sufficient to create a disk .",
    "even though an irrotational ns has less total angular momentum than a corotating one , the matter on the inner edge has a higher specific angular momentum , and is more likely to orbit around the bh rather than infall directly .",
    "in addition , prompt accretion of matter may also be inhibited slightly by a moving bh orbiting the binary center of mass , whereas in our assumption of an extreme mass ratio , the bh position is fixed .    in our future work",
    ", we will test out how shock heating in the accretion disk affects its evolution , and determine if there are cases in which feedback onto the ns will affect its future evolution as well . by including a relativistic artificial viscosity treatment",
    ", we will follow the thermodynamic evolution of the disk , as well as that of the ns and any outward mass loss .",
    "of course , to investigate bhns mergers fully and accurately , we will ultimately have to abandon the assumptions underlying the cf metric as well . while our description of an isolated schwarzschild bh is exact , the bh lapse goes to zero just outside the event horizon .",
    "this causes matter to `` pile up '' around the bh , since the proper time ceases to advance in this region . while this poses no difficulty for determining the fate of the material , which will clearly be accreted , it does act as a computationally challenging ridge of growing mass concentration as material is transferred continuously toward the bh .",
    "these calculations adopted `` undercompact '' nss because we are interested in systems that disrupt outside the isco while restricting our attention to the case of extreme mass ratios . by performing dynamical evolutions using more compact configurations",
    ", we will investigate the transition to the opposite case , in which plunge begins while the ns is still completely bound .",
    "based upon our results , we expect that that in some cases , the mass - transfer rate may prove sufficient to kick the core of the ns back out to a wider , highly elliptical orbit .",
    "the phase space for which this will occur , in terms of the ns eos and binary mass ratio , remains poorly understood , and may not conform to simple analytic estimates , which have difficulty describing the unstable processes that characterize the merger . in @xcite",
    ", it was found for a quasi - newtonian potential that for a mass ratio @xmath294 , a ns described by a @xmath205 eos was disrupted during the initial passage , whereas one with a @xmath295 eos led to a punctuated mass - transfer scenario similar to the one we describe for run b1 above in sec .",
    "[ sec : radreac ] . probing the assumed forms of the ns eos that lead to complete disruption versus survival of a remnant ns core may prove to be a crucial diagnostic tool for determining the true physical ns eos .",
    "in many prior works , it has been assumed that so long as @xmath296 , the ns will necessarily be tidally disrupted , with some of its mass deposited into a disk around the bh . according to @xcite ,",
    "this may not be true .",
    "instead , the plunge may start well outside of the isco , since , based on the properties of quasiequilibrium models , the inspiral time scale may approach the orbital time scale already well outside of the isco ( so that the transition through the isco is nearly dynamical rather than adiabatic ) .",
    "it is unclear exactly what role the spin of the bh will play in this process , though it appears that a prompt merger is more likely for a schwarzschild bh than a spinning kerr bh @xcite , where the latter case is favored by binary evolution calculations @xcite .",
    "two different factors can mitigate a prompt merger , however , and will need to be investigated numerically in more detail .",
    "first , the onset of a `` plunge '' also marks the point at which we assume the quasi - equilibrium formulation to break down . from that point onward",
    ", the ns will no longer follow the trajectory predicted by quasiequilibrium results , and may therefore not plunge as fast as quasiequilibrium models would predict ( in fact , these predictions provide completely unphysical overestimates of the infall velocity at the isco itself ) . perhaps more importantly",
    ", there is no guarantee that a plunge phase will lead to the entire ns being swallowed by the bh @xcite .",
    "angular momentum can be transferred outward within the ns on something approximating the dynamical timescale , and it is possible that some fraction of the mass , perhaps a significant fraction , will survive the initial plunge phase . using the techniques developed here , and initial configurations taken from tbfs , we will study how varying the ns spin and compaction affect the final fate of the ns .",
    "it will be necessary to perform relativistic merger calculations in full generality , in order to drop the assumption that the binary mass ratio is extreme .",
    "we are currently constructing such quasiequilibrium data , which will then serve as initial data for dynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "we expect that these dynamical simulations will be plagued by the same difficulties encountered in dynamical simulations of bhbh binaries , and therefore anticipate that this will be a very challenging project .    until that point",
    ", however , a great deal can be accomplished .",
    "first and foremost would be to identify the boundaries in phase space that separate qualitatively different phenomena that can occur during a bhns merger .",
    "the most obvious categories would be prompt merger , prompt tidal disruption leading to an accretion disk , or a period of periodic mass - transfer bursts , if the latter does occur at all .",
