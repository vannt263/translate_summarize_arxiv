    "<S> using husimi function approach , we study the `` quantum phase space '' of a harmonic oscillator interacting with a plane monochromatic wave . we show that in the regime of weak chaos , the quantum system has the same symmetry as the classical system . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results agree with the results of numerical calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the phase space of a classical harmonic oscillator weakly interacting with a plane monochromatic wave possesses an interesting symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein . ) in the case of exact resonance , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , between the wave ( with the frequency @xmath2 ) and the harmonic oscillator ( with the oscillation frequency @xmath3 ) , and under the condition @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is a dimensionless perturbation parameter ) , the classical phase space consists of an infinite number of resonant cells with the symmetry @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a corresponding phase space with @xmath7 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . at the center of each cell </S>",
    "<S> there is an elliptic stable point . </S>",
    "<S> the particles move in the phase space around this point along the closed trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> the cells are separated from each other by the separatrices which are schematically shown in fig . 1 by dashed lines . </S>",
    "<S> these separatrices form in the phase space an unlimited net . </S>",
    "<S> the net is covered by the stochastic layers forming the infinite stochastic web . </S>",
    "<S> when the perturbation parameter , @xmath5 , is small the web width is exponentially thin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the particle is initially placed inside a stochastic region , it can travel throughout the web and gain energy , even for an arbitrarily small perturbation parameter , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the crystalline and quasi - crystalline symmetries of the classical phase space , and stochastic web differ significantly this system from classical nonlinear systems with chaotic behavior.@xcite these interesting properties of the classical harmonic oscillator in a monochromatic wave motivated our studies of the corresponding properties in the quantum system .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a monochromatic wave is described by the hamiltonian , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator ; @xmath10 , is the interaction hamiltonian ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the amplitude and the wave vector of the wave , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the coordinate and the momentum operators of the particle , @xmath15 is the mass of the particle . the hamiltonian ( 1 ) appears , for example , when analyzing the stability of an ion in a linear ion trap in the field of two laser beams with close frequencies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the quantum system described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is controlled by four parameters : the resonance number , @xmath16 ; the detuning from the exact resonance : @xmath17 ; the dimensionless perturbation parameter : @xmath18 ; and the dimensionless planck constant : @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for the system considered in @xcite , the lamb - dicke parameter , @xmath20 , is related to @xmath21 : @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> influence of these parameters on the dynamics of quantum system was in detail considered in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in this paper , we study the `` quantum phase space '' of a system described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) for the case of exact resonance , @xmath23 ( when the number of the resonance cells is infinite ) and under the condition : @xmath4 ( when the chaotic layers , covering the separatrix net , are exponentially thin ) . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the structure of the `` quantum phase space '' . </S>",
    "<S> we show that quantum system possesses the same symmetry as the classical system . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the quantum system with the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is characterized by the floquet    [ 2.2 ]    states ( or quasienergy states ) found in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in order to build the phase space for the quantum system we use the husimi functions of the floquet states . </S>",
    "<S> the husimi function for the wave function @xmath24 is defined as the projection of @xmath24 on the coherent wave packet , @xmath25 with the maximum at the point ( @xmath26 ) @xcite , @xmath27 the husimi function , @xmath28 , defines the probability of finding a quantum particle characterized by the wave function @xmath24 at the point @xmath29 of the `` quantum phase space '' . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - sections of the husimi function are the lines of equal probability of finding the quantum particle . </S>",
    "<S> below , these lines for husimi functions are compared with the trajectories in classical phase space .    </S>",
    "<S> namely , we analyze the structure of the husimi functions of the quasienergy states and compare them with the structure of the classical phase space . </S>",
    "<S> first , we present some general formulas which will be used to investigate the system described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to decompose the coherent state , @xmath30 , into the complete set of harmonic oscillator eigenstates , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath33-th eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator with the hamiltonian @xmath9 . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ coh ] ) we used the dimensionless coordinate ( @xmath34 ) and the dimensionless momentum ( @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use the same basis to represent of the wave function , @xmath24 , @xmath36.\\ ] ] the structure of the husimi function ( [ hus ] ) is completely defined by the coefficients @xmath37 , @xmath38 it is convenient to use cylindric coordinates , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in these variables , the husimi function ( [ coh1 ] ) is , @xmath42    since the perturbation , @xmath43 , in ( 1 ) is periodic in time , one can use floquet theory and write the solution of the non - stationary schrdinger equation as , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a time - periodic function whose period is @xmath46 . the index </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 labels the quasienergy ( qe ) states . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to use the complete set of harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions to represent the function @xmath48 , @xmath49 where the expansion coefficients , @xmath50 , are time - periodic functions . using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hus_dyn])-([qe_decomposition ] ) we can rewrite the husimi function of the qe state as , @xmath51 where @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the qe states of the monochromatically perturbed harmonic oscillator were studied in detail in a series of papers @xcite , using degenerate resonance perturbation theory for the floquet states . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum regimes corresponding to regular motion and to the case of weak chaos in the classical phase space were investigated . as it was shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the hilbert space of the quantum system breaks up to some approximation into the dynamically independent regions  quantum resonance cells , each of them with its own set of qe states . in the zeroth order ( resonance ) </S>",
    "<S> approximation , the qe functions and the qe spectrum of each cell are almost independent . near the top and bottom of the qe spectrum of an individual cell , </S>",
    "<S> the qe states are the states of an effective harmonic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the qe levels are equally spaced , with a separation @xmath53 between the levels . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency , @xmath54 , in the quasiclassical limit coincides with the frequency of small oscillations near the center of the resonance in phase space . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider only two extreme qe states of an individual cell  </S>",
    "<S> extreme upper and extreme lower qe states , called the `` qe ground states '' . </S>",
    "<S> thus , each quantum resonance cell has two qe ground states . </S>",
    "<S> the qe functions , @xmath55 , and the qe levels , @xmath56 , of the ground states of each individual cell are connected by the relations @xcite , @xmath57 associated with the transformation : @xmath58 in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sho_decomposition]),([qe_decomposition ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> below we analyze the structure of the husimi functions of the qe ground states . </S>",
    "<S> the upper qe function is a gaussian wave packet , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the normalization factor , and @xmath61 is the position of the maximum of the qe wave packet in the hilbert space which corresponds to the quantized radius of the elliptic stable point : @xmath62 ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the wave packet , @xmath63 , in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ coh_n ] ) was defined in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the form , @xmath64 were the function @xmath65 is expressed in terms of the matrix element : @xmath66 . in the quasiclassical region of parameters , </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ width_n ] ) can be expressed through the half width in action of the classical resonance cell , @xmath67 ( expression for the value of @xmath67 see for example in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , @xmath68 where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to the argument . for example , for @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> we have : @xmath70\\}^{1/4}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries of the quantum cells are given by the zeroes of the function @xmath65 . as was shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the function @xmath65 is proportional to the bessel function , @xmath71 , of order @xmath16 : @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> so , the number of levels in the individual cell is proportional to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ratio : ( the packet s width in @xmath33)/(the cell s width in @xmath33 ) is proportional to @xmath73 , and in the quasiclassical limit the relative width of the qe ground state tends to zero .    </S>",
    "<S> the husimi representation allows one to construct the qe eigenstates in the quantum phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest case is the husimi function of a single harmonic oscillator state : @xmath74 , which due to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hus_dyn ] ) has the form , @xmath75 this expression has its maximum at @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the definite value of @xmath77 corresponds to the definite value of the action : @xmath78 . due to the fundamental uncertainty relation , </S>",
    "<S> the phase , @xmath79 , of this state is indefinite . </S>",
    "<S> the husimi function is independent of the phase , @xmath79 , and looks like a round hump .    in agreement with eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) , the husimi function of the ground qe state is , @xmath80 only @xmath81 terms with @xmath82 effectively contribute to the sum on the right - hand side of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phi_q ] ) , and one can neglect all other terms . </S>",
    "<S> then , eq . ( [ phi_q ] ) becomes , @xmath83 where we assumed : @xmath84 , so that , @xmath85 the double sum in eq . ( [ phi_q1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be rewritten as , @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by using the approximation ( [ appr ] ) we find that the husimi function of the extreme qe state , can be factored , @xmath90 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 19 ) , @xmath91 @xmath92    we now find the coordinates of maxima of @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that each maximum of the husimi function corresponds to the stable elliptic point at the center of a resonance cell . </S>",
    "<S> maximum of @xmath94 in @xmath95 is defined from the equation , @xmath96 \\sum_{j=-2\\delta m}^{2\\delta m}\\left(\\frac r{r_e}\\right)^j \\exp\\left(-{j^2\\over 4a_e^2}\\right)+\\ ] ] @xmath97 when @xmath98 , both sums in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dhus_r ] ) are zero : in the first term , the derivative is equal to zero as follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hus_lan ] ) ; in the second term , the sum is equal to zero , and the value @xmath99 can be considered as the radius of the center of the quantum resonance cell in the quantum phase space .    </S>",
    "<S> we now find the maxima of @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to present this function in the form , @xmath101 where we took into account that in the resonance approximation the particle can populate only states with the numbers : @xmath102 ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> all terms in the sum on the right - hand side of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hus_phi_ell ] ) decrease in absolute values as @xmath15 increases . </S>",
    "<S> then , the extrema of the function @xmath103 is defined by the the extrema of the term with @xmath104 . when @xmath69 there is one maximum at @xmath105 ; when @xmath106 there are two maxima at @xmath105 and @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> in general case the function @xmath103 has @xmath16 maxima .    </S>",
    "<S> the extreme lower qe function is related to the extreme upper one by the transformation ( [ transform ] ) , which is convenient to rewrite in the form : @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath109 of the lower ground qe state is , @xmath110 \\exp\\left(-{(\\mu m)^2\\over 4a_e^2}\\right).\\ ] ] the maxima of the function @xmath103 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hus_phi_ell ] ) correspond to minima of @xmath109 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hus_phi_rev ] ) , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for @xmath69 the function @xmath109 has a maximum at @xmath107 ; at @xmath106 there are two maxima at @xmath111 and so on . in general , the husimi functions of the two qe ground states have @xmath6 maxima with the radius @xmath98 . each maximum is situated at    [ 3.7 ]    the center of a quantum resonance cell , so that the quantum phase space has the same symmetry as the classical phase space . for @xmath7 , the symmetry of the husimi function , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , is the same as the symmetry of the classical phase space in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar result was demonstrated numerically in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , in agreement with eq . ( 11 ) , the quantum phase space is symmetric with respect to the substitution : @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no exact symmetry with respect to the transformation : @xmath113 . the reason is presumably related to our approximation ( [ appr ] ) which leads to separation of variables in eq . ( [ phi_q2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is more valid for the `` quasiclassical cells '' with @xmath114 than for `` quantum cells '' , for which the value of @xmath33 is not large . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , that `` quasiclassical cells '' are more symmetrical than the `` quantum cells '' , and the structure of the `` quasiclassical cells '' is close to the structure of the classical cells shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry of the quantum phase space differs this system from quantum chaotic systems with critical threshold to global chaos.@xcite    in summary , the correspondence between the symmetry of the husimi functions of the qe ground states and the symmetry of the classical phase space has been demonstrated for a degenerate system both analytically and numerically . </S>"
