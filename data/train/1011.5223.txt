    "westerlund 1 ( wd  1 ) is among the most massive young clusters in the local group .",
    "recent studies have revived interest in this cluster , discovered already 50 years ago @xcite .",
    "several of these studies focus on the rich population of massive stars that are spectroscopically identified as wd  1 members ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among this population",
    "it has been possible to find wolf - rayet stars , evolved ob stars , and short - lived transitional objects like luminous blue variables and yellow hypergiants .",
    "wd  1 is the only case in which such a rich population of these very rare objects is observable .",
    "this makes wd  1 one of the most important templates for understanding the evolution of very massive stars after they leave the main sequence .",
    "one of the great advantages is that the progenitor s mass of the evolved massive stars can be inferred from the observable main - sequence turn - off .",
    "while the massive stars are bright enough to be observed at optical wavelengths , observations of the intermediate- and low - mass stellar population is best performed in the near - infrared , given the high extinction towards wd  1 of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a study of the wd  1 population below @xmath6 has been recently carried out by @xcite hereafter paper i. in this paper we present comprehensive analysis of the data described in paper i.    with the present estimates of its mass @xmath7 and age from 3 to 6 myr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , wd  1 represents probably the best template in the milky way to understand the cluster mode of star formation that can be observed in other galaxies , like the antennae galaxies , where super star clusters with masses larger @xmath8 have been detected ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the study of the intriguing formation scenario of such massive extragalactic clusters , wd  1 may also serve as a template to understand the interplay between evolution of massive stars and dynamical processes that may lead to the formation of stable , bound and relaxed globular clusters .",
    "given its mass , wd  1 may indeed be able to retain a substantial fraction of its initial stellar population , even though , according to @xcite , it has probably undergone @xmath9 supernova events .",
    "these , in addition to stellar winds and ionizing radiation from the most massive stars , have dispersed the residual gas reservoir of the cluster , decreasing the gravitational binding energy of the system .",
    "if massive enough to resist disruption , wd  1 will eventually turn into a closed , virialized system .",
    "a study of the dynamical status of wd  1 has been made by @xcite .",
    "the authors use the measured radial velocity dispersion for a group of 10 massive stars to infer a dynamical mass of @xmath10 , on the upper end of the wd  1 mass estimates available in the literature . to derive this number , the authors assume virial equilibrium and isotropy of the stellar motions",
    "hence their estimate is an upper limit .",
    "the analysis of star clusters dynamical and structural parameters often assumes spherical symmetry .",
    "hence , the cluster properties , like the imf slope , the stellar density profiles , the stars velocity distributions , are described as 1d functions depending on the distance from the centre of the cluster . however the spherical symmetry assumption may not be valid , and this is the case of wd  1 .",
    "several studies have already shown that wd  1 has indeed an elongated shape , based on x - ray diffuse emission @xcite and stellar counts @xcite . therefore , an unbiased study , which does not assume _ a priori _ any symmetry for the geometry of wd  1 , is needed to properly investigate the spatial properties of the cluster .",
    "we focus our attention on the study of mass segregation , global and spatially varying imf and overall cluster shape as can be derived by the study of density profiles .",
    "these macroscopic properties are , in turn , related to the formation history of the cluster , its internal dynamical evolution and its global interactions with the rest of the galaxy .",
    "we developed new analysis techniques to take into account the observational biases related to the presence of many very bright objects that can hamper a quantitative determination of both the imf slope and the stellar density profiles .",
    "the most important improvement compared to paper i is that we drop any spherical symmetry assumption , regarding the cluster structure .",
    "hence the completeness maps , the photometric errors and the density profiles are all obtained in a 2d approach .",
    "in addition , new stellar evolutionary models are used for comparison with observations .",
    "a probabilistic approach is developed to determine cluster memberships , using a nearby off - cluster image as a control frame for the field population .",
    "stellar masses are derived using a maximum likelihood technique , taking into account realistic photometric errors and their correlations .",
    "imf slopes are inferred using an approach which does not require any binning but makes use of all the information contained in each star s mass - probability - density - distribution .",
    "we use 2d - elliptical - generalization of the radial density profiles by @xcite to obtain shape properties of wd  1 ( e.g. its semimajor axis , elongation and orientation ) .",
    "the paper structure is as follows : we describe the data set used in sect .",
    "[ sec : data ] . the technique to build completeness maps",
    "is introduced in sect .",
    "[ sec:2dmaps ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : everr ] we use simulated stars to obtain photometric errors and their correlation .",
    "a statistical field subtraction method is introduced in sect .",
    "[ sec : subfield ] . after the description of the adopted stellar models ( sect .",
    "[ sec : stellarmodels ] ) , we use them and the clean colour magnitude diagram of wd  1 to infer its properties like extinction , age and distance ( sect .",
    "[ sec : fundpar ] ) . an approach to obtain , for each star , its mass - probability - distribution ( given the adopted models )",
    "is shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : imf ] where we also derive the global imf slope and the variation of the imf slope across the cluster . in sect .",
    "[ sec : morph ] we build cluster density profiles and analyze them using elliptical models .",
    "we also quantify the extent of mass segregation .",
    "the last section deals with our conclusions .",
    "the data set used , the reduction process and the photometric analysis and calibration have been extensively described in paper i ; hence we will only provide a short summary here .",
    "ntt / sofi @xmath11 broad band observations of wd  1 ( centered on ra(2000 ) = @xmath12 , dec(2000 ) = @xmath13 ) and of a nearby comparison field ( offset by @xmath14 to the east and @xmath15 to the south of wd  1 ) , each covering an area of @xmath16 were retrieved from the eso archive ( pi : j.alves ) .",
    "data reduction was performed using the eclipse jitter routines @xcite .",
    "point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry was derived using the iraf implementation of daophot @xcite .",
    "the number of objects detected in both @xmath11 bands is @xmath17 for the wd  1 field and @xmath18 for the comparison field .",
    "photometric zero points and colour terms were computed by comparison of instrumental magnitudes of relatively isolated , bright sources with counterparts in the 2mass point source catalogue @xcite .",
    "to obtain a correct cluster imf and for the analysis of wd  1 density profile , it is necessary to derive appropriate incompleteness corrections . in paper",
    "i the authors considered completeness correction as a function of magnitude and distance from the centre of wd  1 . in the present work we drop the assumption of radial symmetry and",
    "build incompleteness correction maps as a function of the position on the chip and of the magnitude .",
    "the main source of incompleteness in our case is crowding , which severely affects seeing limited observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* as an example ) .",
    "the effects of crowding on the detection of point sources change according to two quantities : the average stellar density and the magnitude contrast between the given point source and its neighbours . both of these quantities may not follow a radially symmetric or regular distribution .",
    "very bright objects are normally scattered over the field in a nonuniform way .",
    "even when they have a regular distribution , they still can cause sudden and very well localized drops in the completeness .",
    "in addition each of them has its own brightness and causes a lack of detections in areas of different angular width over the chip .",
    "stellar density itself does not _ a priori _ have to follow a symmetric distribution ; indeed the actual number of stars for a given position is determined by an interplay of several factors , e.g. the intrinsic spatial distribution of stars within the cluster , varying extinction pattern ( in the foreground , but also within the cluster ) or changes in the fore- and background population characteristics , for example within the spiral arms . for these reasons",
    "we think that an approach that does not assume any spatial distribution in the completeness characteristics of an observed field is preferable , in contrast to integrated or averaged cluster characteristics , and is definitely recommendable when spatial properties have to be investigated . for each photometric band we built a function with 3 variables : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the actual value of the magnitude ( in the @xmath21 band ) and @xmath22 the position at which completeness is evaluated .",
    "it is then possible to associate an incompleteness correction to each star for each photometric band .",
    "the total incompleteness correction for a star detected in both @xmath11 bands is the product of the single corrections in each band .",
    "the reason is that each of these corrections represents the probability of detecting that given star in that specific band , and detections in each band are independent from each other .",
    "the @xmath23 completeness maps have been obtained in several steps , which are detailed in appendix [ app : compmaps ] .",
    "a visualization of the completeness pattern for wd  1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : khalf ] .",
    "we display the @xmath24 band image of the cluster with superimposed 50% completeness magnitude - loci .",
    "the contours are labeled with the corresponding values of @xmath24 magnitudes for which completeness drops to 50 % .",
    "such contours follow the general distribution of stars , but also show peaks around the brightest stars , as expected ; from fig .",
    "[ fig : khalf ] it is clear that radial symmetry is not a perfect assumption for the completeness distribution of wd  1 .    a comparison of the completeness values between wd  1 frame and the off - cluster frame , for both photometric bands , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compcomp ] . given the spatial dependence of the completeness for the wd  1 frame s stars , for them there is not an unique value of the completeness at a given magnitude ; for what concerns the off - cluster frame , we assumed spatial uniformity for the completeness , so the off - cluster frame stars ( red dots ) have unique values of the completeness as a function of magnitude ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : compfield ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : compcomp ] shows that the completeness for the off - frame stars is always higher , at a given magnitude , than the average completeness for the wd  1 frame stars .",
    "similarly , 50% incompleteness is reached for the control field at @xmath25 fainter than the average 50% incompleteness for wd  1 field .",
    "the cause of this difference may be found in the different degree of crowding of the two fields .",
    "the green dots in the figure represent stars in wd  1 frame located at more than @xmath26 from the centre of the cluster , corresponding to @xmath27 pc at the cluster s distance of 4 kpc ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : distage ] ) . even though these latter stars show - as expected - the highest completeness values for wd  1 frame , they still have slightly lower completeness than the off - cluster frame stars .",
    "this is a reason to believe that crowding in this  peripheral  regions of the cluster frame is still higher than in the off - cluster frame , a hint to the presence of a low - mass cluster stellar population extending quite far away from the cluster centre . in sect .",
    "[ sec : morph ] we will show evidence that the low - mass stars of wd  1 may indeed occupy a region with a radius of the order or even larger than 3 pc .",
    "as shown in paper i , the daophot photometric errors are usually an underestimate of the true errors .",
    "daophot errors are connected to the residuals in the psf fitting of the stellar counts . in principle",
    "this error estimate is absolutely correct for isolated stars only , so that the light is coming from the source of interest alone and only if the analytical psf model chosen for psf fitting is the correct representation of the true psf shape . in this ideal case",
    "the errors would come only from the poisson noise in stellar counts . in crowded fields , however , there are additional sources of uncertainty .",
    "the main one is the presence of bright objects .",
    "even though the light from these sources is iteratively subtracted from the frame by the psf fitting algorithm , the unsubtracted noise in the wings of these objects can still affect the magnitude estimate of nearby faint stars .",
    "stellar crowding itself can cause problems when the algorithm has to disentangle very close sources even when they have similar magnitudes .",
    "we use simulated stars to estimate realistic errors as a function of magnitude and position of the stars .",
    "the new estimates of the photometric errors are derived from the difference between the inserted and recovered magnitude of the simulated stars .",
    "in addition , we examine the correlation between the estimated magnitude errors in the @xmath28 and the @xmath24 bands .",
    "the details of errors evaluation are given in appendix [ app : everr ] .",
    "our error estimates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : newerrvsmag ] as a function of magnitude .",
    "we developed a technique for field subtraction based on a probabilistic approach .",
    "the technique takes into account the photometric errors , their correlation and the information about completeness .",
    "the natural space for our approach is an n - dimensional magnitude space .",
    "the technique is quite general and , as long as photometric errors in different bands and their correlations are evaluated , does not have to be limited to two bands . in the case of wd",
    "1 we only used @xmath28 and @xmath24 bands hence we will refer explicitly to them .    in the ideal case , a cluster magnitude - magnitude diagram ( mmd ) would look exactly the same as in the off - cluster field , plus additional stars belonging to the cluster , possibly following a separate sequence in the diagram , along an isochrone .",
    "it should be possible to compute the stellar densities at each mmd position for both the on - cluster and the off - cluster frames and compare them .",
    "regions with an overdensity of stars would correspond to regions occupied by cluster members .",
    "the difficult part in the on - off density comparison is to compute a proper density .",
    "usually this is accomplished by gridding the cmd and by computing a density at each grid cell .",
    "then , according to the numbers in the cluster cells and in the off - field cells , some stars are subtracted , usually by making use of monte carlo techniques .",
    "this approach has been very successful in many applications , also in our paper i. anyway , any gridding or binning procedure always implies a loss of information .",
    "gridding is usually performed using equal cells , and this does not take into account , for example , the fact that photometric errors increase with magnitude , making it less obvious to which cell a faint star should belong . on the bright parts of the cmd",
    "the grid size may instead be very large compared to the photometric errors . in this case",
    "the gridding would result in combining stars that , if errors would be reliable , are very distant from each other  in units of their @xmath29  and then should not be considered ",
    "similar  and assigned to the same cell .",
    "we decided to change this approach and to calculate the density of stars locally , at each position in the cluster s mmd where a star is located .",
    "then we calculated the density in the same point of the mmd , but for the off - frame population .",
    "the ratio of the two densities is a measure of the membership probability of the star that is in that position in the cluster s mmd .",
    "according to its photometric errors , each star is not a single point in the mmd , but a multi - dimensional gaussian _ cloud _ of probability , representing the chance of observing that object in that position . in our 2d case",
    "these gaussians have an elliptical symmetry with semi - axis represented by @xmath30 and a tilt in the mmd related to the correlation between the two magnitude errors .",
    "since gaussian probability is greater than 0 everywhere in the mmd , each star contributes _ a bit _ to the total density at each mmd position , the closest stars to that position having higher weight .",
    "given a star with magnitudes @xmath31 we define the density at its position in the mmd in the following way :    @xmath32 \\times } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\lefteqn { \\ ; \\times \\exp \\left [ -\\frac {   ( \\mathbf{m } - \\bmu_i)^t { \\mathbf\\sigma_i}^{-1 } ( \\mathbf{m } - \\bmu_i ) } { 2 } \\right ] \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{m } \\quad ; } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the asterisk refers to the star at whose position the density is evaluated , such that @xmath33are the completeness fractions for that object , while @xmath34are the completeness fractions for the other stars . the density is calculated in both the on and the off field mmd , hence the index @xmath35 may run respectively on the stars in one or the other field .",
    "the @xmath36 vectors and the @xmath37 matrix are , respectively , the measured magnitudes and the covariance matrix associated to them : @xmath38 @xmath39 is the determinant of the correlation matrix , and @xmath40 is the pearson s correlation coefficient of equation ( [ eq : pearson ] ) .",
    "the @xmath41 vector is the vector of coordinates @xmath42 over which the integration is actually performed .",
    "the integration is ideally performed in the whole ( infinite ) magnitude space . for obvious reasons we limit the numeric integration around each star to a region within @xmath43 for each coordinate .",
    "[ sec : subfield ]    equation ( [ eq : rhodef ] ) deserves several comments .",
    "its meaning is the following : the contribution of the i - th star to the density at the @xmath31 position is the integral of the product of that star s probability distribution , convolved with the probability distribution of the * -th star .",
    "then the total density in that position is the sum over all the @xmath35 stars either in the on - field or in the off - field .",
    "the probability of each single star is normalized to 1 , as it has to be , but it is important to consider the completeness factors @xmath44 for @xmath45 that appear in equation ( [ eq : rhodef ] ) .",
    "these factors account for the missing detections in both the science and the control field .",
    "it is easy to understand why such correction is necessary .",
    "imagine a star in the cluster field , with completeness factor 0.25 ; it means that if we detected that object , then ( in an statistical sense ) , there are 3 other similar objects that we were unable to detect .",
    "now imagine that at the same position in the off - cluster mmd we would detect two objects both with completeness factors equal to 1 .",
    "neglect for a moment the real  cloud  shape of the stars probability density distributions , and consider them _ ideally _ as points in the mmd . by computing densities without the completeness corrections , we would obtain @xmath46 .",
    "hence we would _ oversubtract _ that star from the cluster s mmd . on the other hand ,",
    "the completeness factor tells us that the actual value of @xmath47 is not 1 but 4 , and then we would subtract that object only in 2/4 = 0.5 cases or , better said , we would assign to that star a 50% membership probability ( see also below ) .",
    "once we have both the on- and off - field densities at a given star s location in the mmd , we can compare them .",
    "the ratio @xmath48 defines a rejection probability ; the higher the contrast in the two densities  the lower @xmath49 is  the more likely the object is a member . on the opposite side , when we are in a region of the mmd where no cluster members are present , this number approaches 1 .",
    "hence each detected object has its associated membership probability . to decide whether or not to keep it in the catalogue of member stars , we extracted uniform random numbers @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "then if @xmath51 we discard the object , otherwise we keep it .",
    "this also means that in the following analysis the actual catalogues that we used may differ from one an other , because some stars may be sometimes excluded or included according to this random selection .",
    "the uncertainties related to this selection directly propagate into , e.g. , the imf slope evaluation . to account for this we used multiple catalogue realizations and evaluate the uncertainties in the outcoming results as the scatter in the results ( e.g. the imf slope ,",
    "see [ subsec : imfdet ] for more details ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldsub ] we show the cmds of wd  1 frame and of the control frame , used as a reference for the field population , together with the results of the subtraction process .",
    "the colour coding in the lower panels indicates the rejection probability , @xmath49 .",
    "as already mentioned in paper i , and as is clearly visible in the upper panels of the figure , the foreground and  especially  the background population in the two frames do not look really similar . a possible cause for the differences",
    "might be a different amount of extinction along the different lines of sight in the on and off field .",
    "this population differences cause an under - subtraction of stars in certain regions of the cmd .",
    "however , it is clear that the most likely members in the lower left panel ( the red points ) follow a well defined cluster sequence ; nevertheless some isolated fore and background stars in the cluster s frame also show an artificially high membership probability .",
    "the reason is that there are no objects in the off field mmd at the same position .",
    "to avoid such artificial contamination , in addition to the subtraction process , we used a @xmath52-clipping of our cmd ( see appendix [ subsec : sigmaclip ] ) . after finding the best fitting isochrone ( see sects .",
    "[ sec : stellarmodels ] and [ sec : fundpar ] ) , we decided to keep only stars that lie within 3 @xmath52 from it , i.e. those stars that satisfy the criterion @xmath53 for at least one point @xmath54 on the isochrone .",
    "in the following analysis , we use a combination of padova main sequence ( ms ) isochrones @xcite and pisa pre - main sequence ( pms ) models @xcite .",
    "padova models are accessible on the web and are already provided in the 2mass photometric system . for pisa isochrones , we performed the conversion from the theoretical hr diagram to the observational 2mass - cmd ourselves .",
    "we used @xcite spectra , calculated with the phoenix model atmosphere code for the lowest temperature regions and @xcite spectra , based on atlas9 model atmospheres for the highest temperature in the pms isochrones ( see table [ tab : trmassiso ] ) .",
    "as in paper i , we assumed a solar chemical composition for wd  1 , hence both the ms and pms models used here have this composition .",
    "nevertheless , given the intrinsic differences in the evolutionary codes ( opacity tables , eos , heavy elements mixture ) and given also the fact that the  solar  composition is not exactly the same in the two sets of models , they show some differences in the region of overlap .",
    "small differences are present also between the set of pms isochrones transformed with phoenix and atlas9 model atmospheres .",
    "we have carefully chosen the masses for the transition from one set of models to the other , in order to minimize the differences in colour between them .",
    "the colour differences are shown in table [ tab : trmassiso ] , together with the mass and temperature ranges in which we adopt each model .",
    "the pisa - atlas9 isochrones have been shifted in order to match the padova isochrones at @xmath55 , and the pisa - phoenix have been shifted to match the pisa - atlas9 ones at @xmath56 .",
    "table [ tab : trmassiso ] shows that the offsets are quite small , specially when compared to the expected absolute precision in our photometry , which , taking into account the zero point errors is of the order of 0.05 - 0.1 mag .",
    ".mass , temperatures and magnitude offsets at the transition masses for our combined isochrones .",
    "the ps - at9 offsets are : mag(pisa - at9 ) - mag(padova ) at @xmath57 while the ps - phx offsets are : mag(pisa - phx ) - mag(pisa - at9 ) at @xmath58 .",
