    "to determine the energy required to form a component , the size and orientation of the tooling interface on the workpiece is necessary . while purely analytical models describing this contact are preferable , they are usually difficult to attain for complex metal forming processes . in this study ,",
    "an analytical approach is presented to model the tooling / workpiece contact area in an application of rotary forming . while the present work focuses on an implementation for flow forming ,",
    "the applied technique can be applied to other variants of rotary forming operations such as metal spinning , shear forming , thread rolling and crankshaft fillet rolling .",
    "flow forming , a variant of metal spinning , is a process used to fabricate rotationally symmetrical parts from ductile materials , after @xcite . during flow forming ,",
    "the workpiece is clamped to a rotating mandrel and pressed into contact with the mandrel by rollers .",
    "the rollers induce high levels of plasticity in the workpiece causing it to undergo both reduction in thickness and axial lengthening .",
    "since the rollers press on only a very small area of the overall workpiece at any given time , the deformation is highly localized between the roller and workpiece . to properly understand the distribution of this intense local plastic deformation it is essential to be able to calculate the roller / workpiece contact area from the geometric parameters that govern the flow forming process .",
    "in addition , the roller / workpiece contact area is critical to coupling other experimental findings , such as power consumption , frictional effects , force , stress and strain distributions through the workpiece back to geometric process parameters .    in flow forming , the combined mandrel rotation and linear movement of the rollers induce contact on the workpiece along a helical path .",
    "this helical tool path , coupled with the curved profile of the rollers leads to a very complicated roller / workpiece contact area .    in terms of related tool contact studies , an important analytical derivation of the workpiece contact in shear spinning",
    "was completed by @xcite . however , in a comprehensive review of metal spinning processes , @xcite highlighted that the mechanics of flow forming are quite different than shear spinning .",
    "this is also true for the contact area formulation as there is little roller penetration into the workpiece and deformation proceeds according to the sine rule .    in terms of flow forming specific research , investigations made by gur and tirosh ( 1982 ) , singhal et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , ma ( 1993 ) and jahazi and ebrahimi ( 2000 ) have proposed analytical models of this contact .",
    "gur and tirosh ( 1982 ) developed the formulation of a planar contact area in each of the primary rolling and extrusion deformation directions in backwards flow forming .",
    "singhal et al .",
    "( 1995 ) derived the contact area imposed by tooling in the flow forming of small diameter tubes where the assumption made was that material is assumed to be perfectly plastic , and the tools were assumed rigid .",
    "ma ( 1993 ) extended the work of gur and tirosh ( 1982 ) to derive a critical angle of attack and jahazi and ebrahimi ( 2000 ) extended the contact formulation made by gur and tirosh ( 1982 ) to investigate the mechanics in a specific application of flow forming .",
    "more recently , kemin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , xu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and hua et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have developed finite element ( fe ) models of single roller flow forming . in each of these studies",
    ", contact was modeled explicitly within each respective fe model . furthermore , with the exception of the work by @xcite and @xcite , all previous works have made assumptions concerning the roller / workpiece contact geometry that do not necessarily reflect the actual contact during flow forming .",
    "these assumptions include :    1 .   idealized roller geometry ( i.e. no blending radii ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) ; 2 .",
    "the use of two - dimensional treatments that do not account for the three - dimensional aspects of the workpiece contact ; 3 .   not considering the influence of prior forming steps ( i.e. roller path overlap ) on the instantaneous roller / workpiece contact area .    the most successful technique for modelling the roller / workpiece contact area , and other facets of the flow forming process , has been through fe analyses .",
    "@xcite addressed items 1 and 2 listed above in their work to numerically calculate the roller / workpiece of a single roller flow forming .",
    "however , @xcite did not give the details of their calculation of the contact area , nor did they specifically address item 3 .",
    "@xcite has developed a thorough 3-d fe model that addresses all three items , but an fe approach is still limited to case - by - case application involving extensive pre - processing and explicit geometric modelling .",
    "an analytical solution provides a solution with significantly lower effort . in the present work",
    ", a generalized solution is developed for the roller / workpiece contact area during a single roller flow forming operation that accommodates items 1 to 3 . to accomplish this ,",
    "the following assumptions are made :    1 .   the single roller flow forming process proceeds under steady state conditions . the final and starting thickness ,",
    "mandrel rotation and feed rate are constant .",
    "the deformation response of the workpiece is perfectly plastic .",
    "elastic effects are not considered .",
    "volume of the flow formed workpiece is conserved outside the tool interface .",
    "no material build - up occurs in front of the roller as the workpiece conforms completely with the rigid roller .",
    "during flow forming , the roller contacts the workpiece along a path having a constant pitch ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the profile of the roller can be divided into three regions ; the entry region , the nose region and the exit region .",
    "these regions dictate the size and shape of the roller / workpiece contact area .",
    "the contact area is bounded by three contours : the tangential exit contour , the axial entry contour and the axial exit contour , labeled 1 - 3 respectively in fig .",
    "the contact area extends angularly from the tangential exit contour ( @xmath60 ) through to @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) .    [ fig:1 ]",
    "if the roller has an archetypal flow forming profile similar to that shown in fig .",
    "1 with distinct flat entry and exit regions and a blending radius between the two that creates a nosed roller , the final contact area is dependent on six surfaces ( fig .",
    "3 ) . contour 1 , and the starting points of contours 2 and 3 ( fig .",
    "2 ) can be calculated directly as they lie exclusively on the @xmath7-plane .",
    "the _ a priori _ @xmath16-coordinates of the extents of contour 1 define the axial limits of the roller / workpiece contact area .",
    "once the a solution has been found for the starting and ending points of contour 1 ( by definition the starting points of contours 2 and 3 ) , the common end point of contours 2 and 3 is then solved using an iterative technique .    [ fig:3 ]       it is first necessary to calculate the axial limits of contact by determining the endpoints of contour 1 .",
    "contour 2 is a function of the instantaneous roller contact with the workpiece at pitch @xmath62 .",
    "contour 3 is a function of the instantaneous roller contact on the material as well as the tool contact on the workpiece one revolution of the mandrel beforehand , at @xmath63 .",
    "contour 1 exists solely on the @xmath7 plane and is bound by the points of intersection with contours 2 and 3 .",
    "contour 1 is both dependent on roller geometry and the roller path pitch , @xmath18 .",
    "there are four possible conditions describing the intersection of the current roller position with that of its position on the previous mandrel revolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ]   corresponds to the instantaneous roller position and position @xmath63 corresponds to the roller at one mandrel revolution beforehand .",
    "the upper endpoint of contour 1 can occur within the nosed region of the roller on both the instantaneous position and the position on the previous mandrel revolution ( condition a ) .",
    "it can also occur at the intersection of the exit / entry profiles ( condition b ) , the nosed / entry profiles ( condition c ) or the exit / nosed profiles ( condition d ) of the instantaneous and the previous roller positions.,title=\"fig:\",width=4 ]    calculation of the location of the upper end point of contour 1 for the four conditions shown in fig .",
    "4 is accomplished through comparison of the endpoints of the roller nose profile on the @xmath7 plane . for comparison purposes ,",
    "the local coordinate system is moved on the @xmath37 axis from the global origin by @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath16 coordinates of the upper end point of the nosed region of contour 1 , @xmath43 and @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "5 ) :    [ fig:5 ]     @xmath65    @xmath66    for the lower @xmath37 and @xmath16 coordinates of the end point of the nose region of contour 1 , @xmath39 and @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "5 ) :    @xmath67    @xmath68    the entry profile of the previous roller path and the instantaneous exit profile of the roller will occur at @xmath38 and @xmath53 . these are expressed as :    @xmath69    @xmath70    the values of @xmath43 , @xmath39 , @xmath38 , @xmath59 , @xmath54 and @xmath53 can be compared to identify which contact condition shown in fig .",
    "4 applies .",
    "the conditions and the relationships that must be simultaneously satisfied are shown in table [ table : conditions ] .",
    ".upper axial limits of contact [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the ofat analysis technique is limited as , by definition , it does not allow for simultaneous changes in multiple variables . for the given geometry , however , this analysis does display the following important observations :    * in terms of the largest effect on the overall contact area @xmath2 , changing the material starting and final thicknesses and the pitch had the largest effect .",
    "this is also true for all of the area components , @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 . in order of precedence ,",
    "the variables that had largest sensitivity on the overall area other than thicknesses and pitch were the radius of the mandrel , the attack angle , radius of the roller , with the nose radius having the least effect overall .",
    "* varying the the roller nose radius had the least effect on the contact area as well as the @xmath4 and @xmath8 components . *",
    "the rolling component , @xmath8 , followed the same trends as the overall area for changes in thicknesses , pitch , mandrel / roller radii and attack angle .",
    "this component decreased while the extrusion / drawing component and the overall area increased for larger roller nose radii .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 , is more sensitive to the attack angle than the mandrel radius . * the largest effect on the @xmath4 component , or the drawing / extrusion part of the deformation saw the same precedence of variables as for the overall contact area .",
    "this component showed the same response to variable changes as the overall area . *",
    "the tangential deformation component , @xmath6 , is marginally more sensitive to the radius of the roller than the radius of the mandrel , and the roller nose radius has approximately the same sensitivity as the attack angle .",
    "this component also increased for larger values of pitch and mandrel radius , but decreased for larger roller radii and nose radii .",
    "@xmath6 remained unaffected by changes in attack angle .",
    "* the overall contact area increased with increased variable values in all cases except for the final thickness value and the attack angle .",
    "this decrease was a linear for the former and non - linear for the latter . *",
    "the effect of changing the starting thickness , final thickness and roller nose radius is a linear change for all area components while all others are non - linear .",
    "these findings are of practical importance to flow forming .",
    "if a worn roller is to be re - used after resurfacing , it may be necessary to modify the pitch in order to maintain the same forming geometry when the process was first commissioned .",
    "if a single set of rollers are to be used with different mandrels , it is also important from a process design standpoint so that the same forming zone geometry can be maintained . furthermore , knowing the sensitivity of each of the variables on the overall contact and therefore deformation mode also permits easier troubleshooting of existing processes .",
    "an analytical model of the roller / workpiece interface in flow forming has been developed such that it may predict the contact area .",
    "this model is applicable to all tooling geometries for both forward and backward flow forming processes . due to the general nature of the description of the geometry",
    ", the approach taken can be used for other rotary forming operations where a die or a roller is used to deform a cylindrical workpiece locally .",
    "this model has been compared to experimental data generated from physical modelling and shows excellent correspondence . specifically , the analytical model was found to describe the experimental surface within 0.4 mm based on mean square error .",
    "an example of the application of the model has been demonstrated in the form of a ofat sensitivity analysis applied to independent geometric variables determining tooling interaction .",
    "the independent geometric variables examined were starting and final thicknesses ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , forming pitch ( @xmath18 ) , mandrel radius ( @xmath24 ) , attack angle ( @xmath0 ) as well as roller and roller nose radii ( @xmath25 , @xmath20 ) . these variables were modified over a range of @xmath71 for the starting thickness and 150% for all others .",
    "specific findings showed that on the basis of a unit change in the respective variables :    * @xmath34 had four times the effect on the the change in overall area and components * @xmath35 had 33% more of an effect * @xmath18 had 50% less of an effect , with the exception of the tangential deformation component , @xmath6 which had 50% more of an effect * @xmath24 , @xmath0 , and @xmath25 have less than a @xmath72 effect * @xmath20 caused the least change : less than 7% change in area    the present work could be extended to study the multi - variant effects on the contact area to fully account for the geometric changes during complicated forming processes .",
    "however , geometric factors are not the only process parameters which govern the process .",
    "the main direction of future work is to link the geometric factors to other process factors such as workpiece material properties and tribological considerations to gain deeper insight into the overall process mechanics ."
