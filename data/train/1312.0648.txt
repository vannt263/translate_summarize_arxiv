    "the area of optomechanics has received much attention due to potential applications ranging from precision measurements to fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to optical communications @xcite .",
    "optomechanical systems not only have the potential to become a powerful probe with which to explore the quantum world @xcite , but are also of great interest in the area of optical micro - electromechanical systems @xcite and constitute a setting in which classical non - linear dynamics have to be analyzed @xcite .",
    "one of the paradigmatic models in optomechanics consists of a cavity with one movable mirror .",
    "the movable mirror is a mechanical oscillator and it is coupled to the electromagnetic field by radiation pressure and by thermal or bolometric effects ( absorption of photons distorting and displacing the mirror ) .",
    "the classical dynamics of this type of systems has been studied in @xcite . for the quantum dynamics we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the classical dynamics of an optomechanical set - up similar to the model described above and dominated by bolometric forces has been studied both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "it was found that self - sustained oscillations of the movable mirror are present , that their amplitude settles into one of several attractors ( see also @xcite for this phenomenon ) , and that there is a regime where two mechanical modes of oscillation can be excited .",
    "moreover , it was suggested that the multi - stability can be used as a device to measure small displacements .",
    "the classical dynamics of a set - up dominated by radiation pressure has also been studied both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "it is composed of a toroid cavity and a pump beam .",
    "the toroid cavity executes a periodic motion that was explained by the following intuitive physical picture : radiation pressure induces a flex of the cavity that takes it out of resonance with the pump beam ; this leads to a reduction of radiation pressure and , as a consequence , the cavity moves back into resonance and the process starts over again .",
    "it was found that the cavity vibrations cause modulation of the input pump beam and that this modulation becomes random oscillations with sufficiently high pump power @xcite .",
    "moreover , a radiation pressure induced parametric oscillation instability ( a regenerative oscillation of mechanical eigenmodes ) was analyzed @xcite .",
    "the case where both radiation pressure and thermal effects are relevant has also been studied @xcite .",
    "it has been shown experimentally and theoretically @xcite that these two types of forces operate at different time scales and can lead to dynamics in which chaotic attractors appear . also , @xcite established a very detailed phenomenological model for a micromechanical mirror that incorporates non - linear elastic and dissipative terms , an external excitation force as well as the radiation pressure and thermal forces .",
    "the model was used to describe the results of an experimental study of the dynamics of an optomechanical cavity with micro - mechanical mirrors in two different geometries @xcite .    in this article",
    "we investigate the classical dynamics of a thin cavity movable mirror modelled by a delta - function interacting with a laser by means of radiation pressure .",
    "the purpose of the article is to investigate the dynamics of the system by considering only the leading term in the force affecting the motion of the movable mirror .",
    "this is similar to the way light forces on atoms are discussed in some treatments like @xcite where the atom is first assumed to be instantaneously fixed and the dissipative ( or radiation pressure ) and the reactive ( or dipole ) forces are obtained .",
    "our approach differs from most articles in that we start from approximate maxwell - newton equations valid when the velocity and acceleration of the movable mirror are small so that the movable mirror can deviate far from an equilibrium position .",
    "moreover , we consider the exact modes of the complete system , that is , we do not divide them into modes of the cavity and modes outside of it as if the cavity where composed of perfect mirrors and then couple them through a phenomenological interaction @xcite .",
    "this allows us to incorporate both the transparency of the mirror and the mirror - position dependent cavity resonance frequencies directly in the modes .",
    "as a result of our treatment , we derive the radiation pressure force from a periodic potential and the physical process governing the dynamics in the case of the toroid cavity mentioned above is explicitly and rigorously derived from our equations . the radiation pressure potential gives physical insight into the dynamics of the system and allows us to determine approximate analytical solutions for the motion of the movable mirror",
    "also , special attention is paid in establishing the conditions under which the model is valid .",
    "the intention is to shed more light into the physics and the intricate dynamics of the movable mirror - electromagnetic field system as well as to have a more profound understanding of when the approximate maxwell - newton equations normally used to describe this type of systems are valid .    the model of a _ fixed very thin mirror _ with",
    "non - zero transparency modelled by a delta - function ( known as the lang - scully - lamb or lsl model ) has been used in the past @xcite .",
    "originally it was introduced as a simple more realistic model of a laser with the purpose to explain physical phenomena that could not be answered ( at least satisfactorily ) with the phenomenological models . in particular ,",
    "it was used to explain why the laser line is so narrow , to form a better conceptual picture of the nature of a laser mode , and to account for radiation losses through one of the mirrors of the laser without the use of phenomenological models @xcite .",
    "the investigations were initially restricted to semi - classical treatments and were later extended to full quantum treatments @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the same model was used to explain why the phenomenological models work in the good cavity limit @xcite and to deduce a master equation to incorporate the effects of a finite mirror transmissivity @xcite .",
    "after this article was completed we learned about references @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite presents a scattering approach to describe the coupling of the electromagnetic field to a mobile scatterer ( a mirror or atom ) moving with constant velocity and with a dispersive dielectric constant .",
    "in particular , they derive the friction force and the diffusion affecting the scatterer with the rotating - wave - approximation .",
    "also , @xcite uses a similar scattering approach to study the dynamics of a one - dimensional optical lattice including non - linearities caused by multiple reflections of photons .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we establish the system under study and the model used to describe it .",
    "in section iii we restrict to a single - mode field and derive the potential associated with the radiation pressure force . in section",
    "iv we investigate the dynamics of the movable mirror . in sections v and",
    "vi we consider the cases where the movable mirror is also subject to friction and to a harmonic oscillator potential . finally , the conclusions are given in section vii .",
    "consider a one - dimensional cavity composed of a fixed and perfect ( zero transparency ) mirror and a movable mirror , both parallel to the @xmath0-plane .",
    "the fixed mirror is located at @xmath1 , while the movable mirror is located at  @xmath2  at time @xmath3 and has thickness @xmath4 when it is at rest .",
    "we assume that the movable mirror is a linear , isotropic , non - magnetizable , and non - conducting ( it does not contain any free charges or currents ) dielectric when it is at rest .",
    "for the electromagnetic field we use the gaussian system of units .",
    "we also assume that the electric field is polarized along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "this allows us to take the scalar potential equal to zero and to derive both the electric and magnetic fields from a vector potential .",
    "explicitly , the vector potential @xmath6 is of the form @xmath7 while the electric @xmath8 and magnetic @xmath9 fields are given by @xmath10 notice that we are working in the coulomb gauge .",

    "@xmath14 is the dielectric function associated with the movable mirror .",
    "note that ( [ 1 ] ) corresponds to the usual wave - equation for the potential with the mirror instantaneously fixed at @xmath15 .    in order to take into account the perfect and fixed mirror at",
    "@xmath1  one needs to impose the following boundary condition : @xmath16 this condition comes from imposing  @xmath17  for  @xmath18  and using the usual boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field .    in reference @xcite it is shown that ( [ 1 ] ) is obtained by posing maxwell s equations in inertial reference frames in which the movable mirror is instantaneously at rest and then changing back to the laboratory reference frame ( defined by the condition that the perfect mirror is fixed at @xmath1 ) using ( instantaneous ) lorentz transformations and neglecting terms of order @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and higher powers of them . here",

    "it is important to identify which processes are not taken into account because we have only considered the leading order of the electromagnetic force acting on the movable mirror . in other words , in ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) we have neglected terms of order @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and higher powers of them .",
    "the first corrections to the force on the right - hand side of ( [ 2 ] ) are a friction force proportional to @xmath19 @xcite and an acceleration - dependent force proportional to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the friction force leads to dissipation in the motion of the mirror , while the acceleration - dependent force leads a renormalized mass of the movable mirror .",
    "in addition to the friction and the acceleration - dependent forces , field amplitudes corresponding to different wave - numbers are mixed @xcite .",
    "this last process occurs when terms proportional to @xmath19 are not neglected .",

    "the first one occurs when the frequency of the field is much larger than @xmath43 over the characteristic time - scale of the movable mirror , the second when the former is much smaller than the latter , and the third treats the values in between .",
    "we found that the rwa regime is a natural setting for the equations , while the intermediate regime is compatible with them for a certain range of parameters .",
    "the high intensity regime is incompatible with the equations used , since the movable mirror can be subject to large accelerations in this case . in order to treat the high intensity regime and the intermediate case in some range of parameters it is fundamental to include the corrections of order @xmath19 and @xmath20 to the force affecting the movable mirror .",
    "therefore , effects such as dissipation and mixing of field amplitudes corresponding to different wave - numbers @xcite become relevant in this case . also , it is important to note that the system exhibits conservative dynamics only in the rwa regime .",
    "the introduction of the radiation pressure potential gave rise to an intuitive physical understanding of the dynamics of the movable mirror .",
    "in the rwa regime and when only radiation pressure is considered , the movable mirror has constant energy and can have either a bounded or unbounded trajectory where it accelerates as it approaches a minimizer and decelerates as it approaches a maximizer of the radiation pressure potential . in the case of a bounded trajectory , the movable mirror is bound to one of the potential wells and executes non - harmonic oscillations around one of the minimizers of the radiation pressure potential .",
    "the consideration of the exact modes of the whole system allowed us to explain this trajectory as follows .",
    "as the mirror approaches the resonance position , the cavity field increases and exerts a radiation pressure that surpasses the one exerted by the field outside the cavity and that pushes the mirror away from the resonance position .",
    "as the mirror withdraws from the resonance position , the cavity field is emptied and the field outside exerts a larger force that pushes the mirror back to the resonance position .",
    "this process repeats itself over and over giving rise to the periodic trajectory of the mirror .",
    "outside the rwa regime the dynamics of the mirror are much more complex since the mirror can jump between potential wells .    in the rwa regime and when the movable mirror is also subject to friction linear in the velocity , the movable mirror continually losses energy and eventually tends to the position of a minimizer ( or maximizer ) of the radiation pressure potential .",
    "since this position is very different from the resonance position , the cavity field is emptied . outside the rwa regime",
    "the dynamics are much more complex , since the movable mirror can jump between wells of the radiation pressure potential before settling in one of its minimizers ( or maximizers ) .",
    "for some values of the parameters there is numerical evidence that the mirror can even execute periodic oscillations around one the minimizers .    in the rwa regime and",
    "when the movable mirror is subject both to friction and to a harmonic oscillator potential centred at a resonance position , the movable mirror always tends to a minimizer ( or maximizer ) of the sum of the harmonic oscillator and radiation pressure potentials .",
    "outside the rwa regime and after a transient , the movable mirror settles in a harmonic oscillation of frequency 2 times the frequency of the field and around an aforementioned minimizer . moreover , there is resonance in the amplitude if the frequency of the harmonic oscillator is equal to two times the frequency of the field .    in future work",
    "we will include in the dynamics the friction force associated with the interaction with the field .",
