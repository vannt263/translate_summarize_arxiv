    "the stability of excited states is important because they may be intermediate states during the formation of these stars .    in this work",
    "we also begin an exploratory investigation of ground state soliton stars in three - dimensional numerical relativity with the goal of performing stable evolutions and extracting gravitational waveforms .",
    "numerical relativity has made major progress in the past few years .",
    "it is now possible to evolve binary black hole inspirals stably for many orbits @xcite .",
    "gravitational waveforms from black hole simulations have been extracted and match accurately against post - newtonian estimates @xcite .",

    "generating numerical waveforms from other compact objects predicted by general relativity such as soliton stars ( comprised from real scalar fields ) and boson stars ( made up from complex scalar fields ) is a timely and necessary effort .",
    "gravitational waveforms from two colliding boson stars @xcite as well as from single distorted boson stars @xcite have been extracted . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first soliton star study in 3d numerical relativity .",
    "numerous authors have studied soliton stars numerically in spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "mathematically , oscillating soliton stars are nonsingular solutions to the einstein - klein - gordon ( ekg ) equations represented by a massive real scalar field for which both the metric and the scalar field are periodic in time @xcite .",
    "the absence of static equilibrium configurations contrasts oscillatons with the case of boson stars , which are complex scalar field solutions to the ekg equations that have equilibrium configurations characterized by static metric components ( the scalar field has an @xmath1 time dependence but the metric and energy itself are time independent ) , and makes their evolution more challenging numerically .",
    "similar to boson stars and neutron stars , the mass profile of ground state soliton stars has a stable ( @xmath0-branch ) and an unstable branch ( @xmath2-branch ) @xcite .",
    "the mass profile has a maximum at @xmath3 corresponding to a central density @xmath4 @xcite ( here @xmath5 is the mass of the scalar field . ) the configurations to the left ( lower central density ) of this critical mass are stable , while those to the right ( greater central density ) are unstable .    in this paper we study the stability of excited state oscillatons under radial perturbations and find that all excited configurations are inherently unstable .",
    "they either migrate to the ground state or collapse to black holes .",
    "we present simulations for both scenarios for configurations in the first excited state .",
    "we find the mass profile of first excited state configurations as a function of central density @xmath6 ( see fig .  [ figmassexcited ] . )",
    "it has a maximum at a similiar critical density as for ground state stars , but in this case it corresponds to a higher critical mass of @xmath7 .",
    "we evolve @xmath0-branch one - node stars when no explicit perturbation is applied other than that induced by the numerical grid ( we covered the 95% mass radius of the star with the same number of grid points @xmath8 to make meaningful comparisons ) and find that stars that are unable to migrate to the ground state collapse to black holes .",
    "the migration can occur only if the star can lose enough mass through scalar radiation to become an @xmath0-branch ground state configuration with @xmath9 .",
    "a first excited state star of mass @xmath10 succeeds in losing its excess mass and migrates to the ground state .",
    "we study the relative times of collapse to black holes of different configurations for @xmath0-branch stars with mass @xmath11 . the collapse times that we tabulate",
    "are approximate because polar slicing does not penetrate black hole horizons .",
    "we find that this time decreases as the central density increases .",
    "we also present a simulation of the migration of a one - node star to the ground state and find the ground state configuration that it migrated to .",
    "we then simulate the migration of a 5-node configuration to the ground state . during the migration process the star cascades through a superposition of lower excited state configurations .",
    "we are able to determine an approximate 4-node intermediate state and then follow the evolution until the star settles into a ground state configuration .",
    "the simulations are performed using the polar slicing condition @xmath12 , which is a natural choice for spherically symmetric spacetimes @xcite .    in the second part of the paper we focus on 3d simulations of ground state soliton stars .",
    "we use the cactus computational toolkit @xcite with the scalar field evolution of guzman @xcite and the bssn implementation @xcite of the einstein equations .",
    "soliton stars retain some of the properties of boson star systems that made them a good testbed for numerical relativity in that the space - time is singularity free and the star has a smooth outer boundary .",
    "however , the evolutions are challenging because the system is highly dynamic , i.e. , the metric functions , extrinsic curvature components , and gauge functions are always rapidly oscillating in time .",
    "in particular , finding an appropriate slicing condition and implementing it accurately to obtain stable evolutions is a challenge for such dynamic spacetimes .",
    "we introduce a customized slicing condition based on the features of an eigenstate of a stable branch oscillaton in spherical symmetry and we refer to it as _ truncated fourier slicing_. instead of enforcing that @xmath13 be zero as in the case of dynamic boson star evolutions @xcite , for this system we drive @xmath13 to the time dependent @xmath14 , which is the trace of extrinsic curvature appropriate for a spherically symmetric oscillaton eigenstate expanded to finite order in a fourier series .",
    "while this condition is based on an eigenstate , we find that it is effective in simulations with small nonspherical perturbations applied to the star . with this choice of gauge",
    "we are able to reproduce results from 1d codes within the 3d context , and we are able to perform stable simulations of sufficient duration to extract gravitational waveforms .",
    "we then study soliton stars under small nonradial perturbations and the emitted gravitational waves .",
    "we use two types of perturbations .",
    "the first type was previously applied to boson stars by guzman @xcite .",
    "it consists of an imposed asymmetry in the grid resolution @xmath15 , while choosing the number of points @xmath16 such that the distance from the origin to the boundary of the grid is kept the same . in this case",
    "the resolution itself is the perturbation .",
    "consequently , the amplitude of the @xmath17 zerilli waveform @xcite is expected to be zero in the limit of infinite resolution and is observed numerically to converge away with resolution at approximately second order .",
    "we next study an oscillaton under a perturbation proportional to the @xmath18 spherical harmonic that perturbs the metric of the eigenstate nonradially .",
    "this perturbation is more physical as it could mimic a disturbance in the gravitational field of the star due to the presence of another object .",
    "the zerilli and newman - penrose @xmath19 @xcite gravitational waveforms are extracted and compared at different detectors .",
    "the waveforms damp out on a short timescale .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that , similar to boson stars , soliton stars have only strongly damped modes because the scalar field extends to infinity and this allows energy to be radiated away rapidly @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the energy radiated in gravitational waves from the zerilli function . by the end of our simulations the energy as a function of time",

    "these three test runs are carried out to a time of @xmath163 ; for longer simulations that study perturbed soliton stars we find that the use of the truncated fourier slicing condition is necessary to control the coordinate drifting of metric functions to an acceptable tolerance and to perform the gravitational wave extraction accurately",

    "high frequency oscillations appear at late times .",
    "they are likely an artifact of the numerical discretization .",
    "the frequency and amplitude of these oscillations are resolution dependent ( see inset ) ; these data show the amplitude to converge away to second order .",
    "a more advanced technique such as adaptive mesh refinement that provides higher resolution would enable us to extend the convergence test to finer grid resolutions .",
    "within all our 3d simulations we use the l2-norm of the hamiltonian constrant as a measure of the error .",
    "this is typically of the order of a few @xmath186 and below @xmath187 for all the simulations in this section .",
    "for the first time excited state soliton stars have been studied .",
    "excited state configurations have field configurations characterized by nodes . for a given central field density @xmath6 ,",
    "these stars are typically larger ( greater radius ) and more massive than corresponding ground state stars .",
    "we find that their mass profile is similar to that of ground state configurations ; they have two branches separated at the maximum mass .",
    "the branch to the left of this maximum is traditionally called the @xmath0-branch because ground state configurations on this branch are stable to radial perturbations in the sense that they migrate to new configurations on the same branch . in spite of this similarity in the mass profile , we find that all excited state configurations are inherently unstable . unlike ground state configurations ,",
    "excite state stars on the @xmath0-branch do not migrate to new configurations on the excited state @xmath0-branch when perturbed .",
    "they can either migrate to the ground state if they lose enough mass through scalar radiation or collapse to black holes .",
    "higher excited state configurations migrate to the ground state sometimes cascading through intermediate excited states .",
    "we show one such migration for a five - node excited state star and find the four - node intermediate state that it is nearest to during the migration process .",

    "also , for the first time , the numerical evolution of ground state oscillaton stars is conducted on a full 3d grid , allowing the study of nonradial perturbations with gravitation waveform extraction .",
    "these simulations are challenging because soliton stars are very dynamic , with no equilibrium configurations having static metric components . in this paper",
    "we compare slicing conditions previously used for 3d boson star simulations with a new slicing condition specifically designed for soliton stars .",
    "we find that the latter is more accurate and more stable .",
    "we see the energy density in 3d converging with resolution to that in 1d for the spherically symmetric case and the highest resolution 3d simulation matching the 1d result very accurately .    in 3d",
    "we explore two types of nonradial axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "first , the spherically symmetric 1d eigenstate data is interpolated on the 3d grid with an imposed asymmetry in the grid resolution @xmath15 .",
    "no explicit perturbation is applied .",
    "this has the advantage that the initial data automatically satisfies the einstein - klein - gordon equations .",
    "however , this perturbation is not easy to interpret physically .",
    "we successfully extract the zerilli gravitational waveforms for a series of simulations at different resolutions and observe the amplitude of the signal due to this resolution - based perturbation to converge away with improved resolution .",
    "the convergence rate is approximately second order as expected .",
    "a second perturbation is applied explicitly to the metric function @xmath65 and is proportional to the @xmath188 spherical harmonic . both the @xmath189 zerilli function and the newman penrose scalar @xmath19 are extracted .",
    "this perturbation more closely represents a physical disturbance of the star and leads to a finite signal that does not converge away as in the previous case .",
    "the waveforms damp rapidly and thus the complete gravitational waveform could be extracted on a relatively short time scale .",
    "this is consistent with expectations from perturbation theory for stars that have a scalar field extending to infinity such as soliton stars and boson stars @xcite .",
    "we also measure the energy radiated in gravitational waves as a function of time and find that it flattens as the signal damps out .",
    "this is an exploratory investigation that is meant as a starting point for future work .",
    "possible improvements include using an adaptive mesh refinement technique for better resolution and finding a more general gauge condition that would be applicable to strongly perturbed soliton stars",
    ". these would enable the study of more advanced scenarios involving real fields such as soliton star collisions .",
    "we make extensive use of the cactus computational toolkit , and its infrastructure for solving einstein s equations .",
    "the simulations have been performed on the ncsa tungsten cluster under computer allocation tg - mca02n014 .",
    "we use the bspline package from the gnu software library @xcite for interpolation of initial data and the petsc solver @xcite for solving elliptic equations .",
    "we especially want to thank francisco s. guzman for advice and encouragement at the beginning of the project , without which this paper would not have been completed .",
    "we would also like to acknowledge francisco for developing the 3d evolution routine for the scalar field .",
