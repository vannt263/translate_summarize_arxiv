    "in the last few years there has been renewed interest in studying topological obstructions to graph colorings .",
    "the subject itself dates back at least to 1978 , when lovsz introduced the so - called neighborhood complexes and used their connectivity properties to bound chromatic numbers of graphs , see  @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.3 ) for historical surveys .",
    "@xmath1    the recent surge of activities has been caused by two major factors .",
    "the first one is the appearance of a  new family of cellular complexes , the so - called -complexes , which were defined by lovsz as a  natural generalization of the original neighborhood complexes , and of the related to them lovsz complexes .",
    "the latter ones are certain subcomplexes of the barycentric subdivisions of the neighborhood complexes .",
    "the -complexes will be defined in section  [ sect:4 ] , meanwhile we remark that , unlike all previous constructions , these are not simplicial , but rather _ prodsimplicial _ complexes , see ( * ? ? ? * subsection 2.1.1 ) .",
    "the second major factor is the detailed study of -complexes undertaken a  few years ago in a  series of papers by babson&kozlov , @xcite , see also the survey @xcite .",
    "several objectives were pursued in these papers .",
    "first , a  general functorial framework was developed , connecting graphs to category theory , and putting arguments about maps between -complexes induced by graph homomorphisms and group actions on -complexes on a  firm theoretical basis .",
    "second , the particular @xmath0-action induced by flip of an edge , or by a  reflection of an  odd cycle , was brought forward as one containing nontrivial obstructions to graph colorings , in case the edge or the odd cycle are used as test graphs .",
    "@xmath1    finally , though perhaps most importantly , the use of characteristic classes in the context of obstructions to graph colorings , and more generally in the context of obstructions to the existence of discrete structures was pioneered in the series of papers mentioned above . in the previous work one",
    "has used the connectivity tests .",
    "this was reflected in the formulation of conjectures and theorems in the fact that the central notions used to express bounds for chromatic numbers were @xmath0-index and @xmath0-coindex of a  @xmath0-space .",
    "once the language of characteristic classes was introduced , it became natural to change formulations to the study of these cohomological obstructions .",
    "since some specific @xmath0-actions appeared of importance in the studied context , babson&kozlov have concentrated on studying the stiefel - whitney classes of the associated line bundle , more concretely on introducing the height of these classes as a  benchmark of measuring the obstructions , thereby replacing the previously used notions of @xmath0-index and @xmath0-coindex . even though at the present time all the papers on the subject are devoted to this particular family of obstructions , it is very likely , and has been suggested by babson&kozlov , that other characteristic classes contain further obstructions in various discrete settings , not restricted to graph colorings only .    following the initial papers @xcite",
    "there has been a  substantial body of work on @xmath2-complexes , we mention here some of the references @xcite .",
    "@xmath1    a  simple homology test for bounding the @xmath0-index of a  @xmath0-space has been suggested in 1983 by walker , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we generalize walker s result and describe a  homology test for bounding the stiefel - whitney height .",
    "the most interesting aspect of this is that combined with the general philosophy of stiefel - whitney test graphs , as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 6.1.2 ) , it produces a  whole family of homology tests - one test for each choice of the test graph ( which is the graph we test with , not the graph which is being tested ! ) .",
    "these homology tests do give different answers for different test graphs . today",
    "the most frequently used test graphs are an  edge @xmath3 , odd cycles of varying lengths @xmath4 , and complete graphs @xmath5 , for @xmath6 .",
    "it has also been suggested by lovsz that also other kneser graphs could be test graphs .",
    "we shall give a  few examples where the odd cycle test gives better bounds than the edge test .",
    "it should be specifically mentioned here that since our homology tests are based on the information about the stiefel - whitney heights , they will never give theoretically better results than the ones derived from stiefel - whitney heights directly .",
    "therefore the homology tests make sense in the concrete situations when they are easier to perform than the corresponding stiefel - whitney height tests .",
    "this is frequently the case , since computing homology groups of combinatorially defined cell spaces , rather than computing some special elements contained in the cohomology groups of their quotients , is more accessible , and has until now been the central object of study of topological combinatorics .",
    "@xmath1    to fix the notations we quickly recall some standard terminology from algebraic topology . since we are aiming to explain our tests in as elementary way as possible , we shall trace all maps to the cochain level .",
    "an  arbitrary cw complex @xmath7 is called a  _ @xmath0-space _ , if it is equipped with a  fixed point free cellular involution . in such a  case",
    "we denote the latter by  @xmath8 , or simply by  @xmath9 .",
    "clearly , involutions and @xmath0-actions can be identified , so we do not distinguish between the two . furthermore , since @xmath7 may admit several involutions , the choice of @xmath9 is fixed when we call @xmath7 a  @xmath0-space ; formally we could have said that a  @xmath0-space is actually a  pair @xmath10 consisting of a  cw complex and a  choice of an  involution .",
    "this involution is often called the _ structural involution _ , and the corresponding @xmath0-action",
    "is called the structural @xmath0-action .",
    "a  cellular map between two @xmath0-spaces , which commutes with the respective structural involutions , is called a  _ @xmath0-map_. clearly , we have a  category whose objects are @xmath0-spaces , and whose morphisms are @xmath0-maps .    given a  @xmath0-space @xmath7 , let @xmath11 denote the quotient map , which maps each point of @xmath7 to its orbit under the structural @xmath0-action . since the involution @xmath9 is cellular , the quotient space @xmath12 can be equipped with the orbit cw structure , making the map @xmath13 cellular as well .",
    "we let @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the induced linear maps between the corresponding chain and cochain complexes respectively . by definition",
    "we have @xmath16 , for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "clearly , the @xmath0-action on @xmath7 induces @xmath0-actions both on the cochain complex @xmath19 and on the cohomology groups @xmath20 , in both cases we denote the induced involutions by  @xmath21 .",
    "we let @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the vector subspaces fixed by that action .",
    "@xmath1    a  standard notion which one considers in the context of @xmath0-spaces @xmath10 is the so - called _ symmetrizer operator _ @xmath24 .",
    "it is defined by setting @xmath25 , for arbitrary @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath27 , hence @xmath28 . also we remark that the symmetrizer operator commutes with the coboundary operator .",
    "when @xmath29 is an  @xmath30-dimensional cell of @xmath7 , we let @xmath31 denote the corresponding generator of the cochain group @xmath32 . with these notations , we have @xmath33 for an arbitrary @xmath30-cell @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , @xmath34 .",
    "the latter cochain evaluates to @xmath35 on @xmath29 and on @xmath36 , and to @xmath37 on other cells , which by definition is the same as the left hand side of  .",
    "an easy , but important for us observation , is that for an  arbitrary @xmath0-space @xmath7 we have @xmath38 the crucial fact needed to see is that the involution @xmath9 is fixed point free .",
    "indeed , for any nonnegative integer @xmath30 , the vector space @xmath39 has a  basis consisting of @xmath40 , where @xmath29 ranges over a  set of @xmath30-dimensional cells of @xmath7 , obtained by choosing exactly one cell from each orbit of the @xmath0-action on the set of all @xmath30-dimensional cells of @xmath7 .",
    "this shows that @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "the equation implies immediately that @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , one sees further that @xmath43 is an  isomorphism .",
    "we let @xmath44 denote its inverse .",
    "@xmath1    let @xmath45 denote the @xmath0-space @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the standard infinite - dimensional sphere , and @xmath9 is the antipodal map . consider the @xmath0-invariant cell subdivision of @xmath45 into hemispheres .",
    "this will give a  cw structure with 2 cells in each dimension . denoting the @xmath30-dimensional hemispheres by @xmath48 and @xmath49 we see that @xmath50 .",
    "the induced cw structure on @xmath51 will have one cell in each dimension , and we let @xmath52 denote the cell in dimension  @xmath30 , for each nonnegative integer  @xmath30 .",
    "since all homotopy groups of @xmath45 are trivial , we can find a  @xmath0-equivariant map @xmath53 .",
    "this will also give the induced quotient map @xmath54 the map @xmath55 , and hence also the map @xmath56 , can be chosen to be cellular ; this follows from the standard construction of @xmath55 , which proceeds inductively through the dimensions and uses the extension property , valid due to the triviality of the homotopy groups , at each step . by the general theory of principal @xmath57-bundles ,",
    "the induced @xmath0-algebra homomorphism @xmath58 is independent of the choice of the map  @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , recall that if @xmath59 denotes the nontrivial cohomology class in @xmath60 , then @xmath61 $ ] as a  graded @xmath0-algebra , with @xmath59 having degree  1 .",
    "we denote the image @xmath62 by @xmath63 .    the map @xmath64 is completely determined by the element  @xmath63 , which is called the _ stiefel - whitney class _ of the @xmath0-space  x. it is also the stiefel - whitney characteristic class of the associated line bundle .",
    "clearly , @xmath65 , and furthermore , if @xmath66 is another @xmath0-space , and @xmath67 is a  @xmath0-map , then @xmath68 .",
    "we refer the interested reader to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsections 3.1.1 , 3.1.2 ) , and the classical textbook  @xcite .",
    "@xmath1    as mentioned above , one of the major aspects of the series of papers by babson&kozlov was to pinpoint the following standard notion of algebraic topology as relevant in the graph coloring context .",

    "if no such @xmath70 exists , then the space @xmath7 is said to have infinite height .",
    "we remark that for a  nonempty @xmath0-space @xmath7 we have @xmath72 if and only if no connected component of @xmath7 is mapped onto itself by the structural @xmath0-action , in other words the structural involution must be swapping the connected components of  @xmath7 . in this case , consistently with definition  [ df : height ] , we will say that the height of @xmath7 is equal to  @xmath37 .",
    "the following theorem generalizes a  result of walker ,  @xcite . even in the special case considered in @xcite the proof given here is simpler , bypassing the homotopy considerations , and dealing directly with the cohomology groups .",

    "this is true because _ if @xmath76 is a  non - trivial vector space over @xmath0 , and @xmath9 is an  involution of @xmath76 , then @xmath9 fixes a  nontrivial subspace of @xmath76 .",

    "this argument also implies that the condition of @xmath0-invariance of the homology class in the original theorem by walker , see @xcite , is superfluous . as a  matter of fact , the cohomology class which our proof of the theorem [ thm : main ] produces will come out to be @xmath0-invariant anyway .",

    "we see that to understand whether the first homology group of @xmath144 is trivial or not requires quite a  bit of additional work . in this case",
    "the complex does actually turn out to be simply connected ; for the sake of brevity we omit the verification of this fact .",
    "in particular , @xmath205 , and furthermore , it is easy to see that @xmath206 , hence the best value of @xmath143 for @xmath146 , in theorem  [ thm : htest ] is @xmath207 .",

    "one direct way to see this winding direction is as follows : map @xmath186 to a  triangle with vertices @xmath214 by taking @xmath215 , and @xmath216 to @xmath217 , for @xmath218 , this associates a  map from @xmath155 to @xmath152 to each map from @xmath155 to @xmath57 , hence the corresponding winding direction is well - defined .    consider now a  vertex @xmath219 of @xmath154 ( this is the same as a  graph homomorphism from @xmath155 to @xmath57 ) which maps some edge of @xmath155 to the edge @xmath220 .",

    "in both cases we conclude that all the vertices of @xmath154 are connected by a  path to one of the vertices of @xmath185 .",
    "since the latter has two connected components , we conclude that also the complex @xmath154 has at most two connected components .    to see that the complex @xmath154 is actually connected we need to present a  path which connects two vertices whose winding directions ( which were defined above ) are different .",
    "such a  path is given by the 3 vertices @xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 , see figure  [ fig : ex3.1 ] .",
    "as we have seen in the last example , even if the homology tests using an edge or an  odd cycle yield the same bound for the chromatic number , it is often to easier verify this bound using the odd cycle , since the tests are done in one dimension lower , so we have to verify that something is connected instead of verifying that the all loops are boundaries , or we have to deal with loops instead of the 2-dimensional cycles , and so on . for these reasons",
    ", it appears in general to be preferable to test with graphs with high chromatic number , although naturally there is no guarantee that these tests will give sharp bounds .",

    "indeed , since the vertices @xmath246 are chosen to be sufficiently far from each other , @xmath144 can be obtained from the union of @xmath247 and @xmath248 by gluing in @xmath249 additional simplices .",
    "each such simplex is obtained by choosing a  vertex @xmath241 , for some @xmath250 $ ] , and then either taking all edges leaving @xmath241 or taking all edges entering  @xmath241 .",
    "these simplices are disjoint , and we see , that up to homotopy equivalence , the effect of adding these simplices is the same as that of attaching @xmath249 cords connecting the complexes @xmath247 and @xmath248 . since these initial complexes are connected , we can conclude that @xmath144 is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of @xmath247 , @xmath248 , and @xmath251 copies of  @xmath252 .",
    "thus , no matter what the chromatic numbers of the graphs @xmath57 , @xmath236 , and @xmath237 are , the homology test using @xmath3 as the test graph will only give the bound  @xmath243 for  @xmath253 .",
