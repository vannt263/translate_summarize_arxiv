    "modeling the dynamics of vehicular traffic flow has constituted the subject of intensive research by statistical physics and applied mathematics communities during the past years @xcite .",
    "in particular , cellular automata approach have provided the possibility to study various aspects of these truly non - equilibrium systems which still are of current interest @xcite . besides various theoretical efforts aiming to understand",
    "the basic principles governing the spatial - temporal structure of traffic flow , considerable attempts have been made towards realistic problems involving optimization of vehicular traffic flow . while the existing results in the context of highway traffic seem to need further manipulations in order to find direct applications , researches on _ city traffic _ have more feasibility in practical applications @xcite .",
    "we believe that optimisation of traffic flow at a single intersection is a substantial ingredient for the task of global optimisation of city networks @xcite .",
    "isolated intersections are fundamental operating units of complex city networks and their thorough analysis would be inevitably advantageous not only for optimisation of city networks but also for local optimization purposes .",
    "recently , physicists have paid notable attention to controlling traffic flow at intersections and other traffic designations such as roundabouts @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "our objective in this paper is to study another aspect of conflicting traffic flow at intersections . in principle",
    ", the vehicular flow at the intersection of two roads can be controlled via two distinctive schemes . in the first scheme , which is appropriate when the density of cars in both roads are low , the traffic",
    "is controlled without traffic lights . in the second scheme ,",
    "signalized traffic lights control the flow .",
    "in the former scheme , approaching car to the intersection yield to traffic at the perpendicular direction by adjusting its velocity to a safe value to avoid collision . according to driving rules ,",
    "the priority is given to the nearest car to the intersection .",
    "it is evident that this scheme is efficient if the density of cars is low .",
    "when the density of cars increases , this method fails to optimally control the traffic and long queues may form which gives rise to long delays . at this stage",
    "the implementation of the second scheme i.e. ; utilizing traffic lights is unavoidable . therefore it is a natural and important question to find out under what circumstances the intersection should be controlled by traffic lights ? more concisely , what is the critical density beyond which the non - signalised schemes begins to fail . in order to capture the basic features of this problem , we have constructed a cellular automata model describing the above dynamics .",
    "this paper has the following layout . in section",
    "ii , the model is introduced and driving rules are explained . in section iii ,",
    "the results of the monte carlo simulations are exhibited .",
    "concluding remarks and discussions ends the paper in section iv .",
    "we now present our ca model . consider two perpendicular one dimensional closed chains each having @xmath0 sites .",
    "the chains represent urban roads accommodating unidirectional vehicular traffic flow .",
    "they cross each other at the sites @xmath1 on the first and the second chain respectively . with no loss of generality",
    "we take the direction of traffic flow in the first chain from south to north and in the second chain from east to west ( see fig.1 for illustration ) .",
    "the discretisation of space is such that each car occupies an integer number of cells denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the car position is denoted by the location of its head cell .",
    "time elapses in discrete steps of @xmath3 @xmath4 and velocities take discrete values @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is the maximum velocity of cars .        to be more specific , at each step of time , the system is characterized by the position and velocity configurations of cars .",
    "the system evolves under the nagel - schreckenberg ( ns ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "let us briefly explain the ns updating rules which synchronously evolve the system state from time @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "we denote position , velocity and space gap of a typical car at timestep t by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the same quantities for its leading car are correspondingly denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we recall that gap is defined as the distance between front bumper of the follower to the rear bumper of its leading .",
    "more precisely , @xmath13 . concerning the above considerations , the following updating sub steps evolve the position    and the velocity of each car in parallel .",
    "+ 1 ) acceleration : + @xmath14 + 2 ) velocity adjustment : + @xmath15 + 3 ) random breaking with probability @xmath16 : + if random @xmath17 then @xmath18 + 4 ) movement : @xmath19 + the yielding dynamics in the vicinity of the intersection is implemented by introducing a safety distance @xmath20 .",
    "the approaching cars ( nearest cars to the crossing point @xmath21 ) should yield to each other if their distances to the crossing point , denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the first and second street respectively , are both less than the safety distance @xmath20 . in this case",
    ", the movement priority is given to the car which is closer to the crossing point .",
    "this car adjust its velocity as usual with its leading car . on the contrary , the further car , which is the one that should yield , brakes irrespective of its direct gap .",
    "the simplest way to take into this cautionary braking is to adjust the gap with the crossing point itself .",
    "this implies that the yielding car sees the crossing point as a hindrance .",
    "in this way , the model is collision - free .",
    "figure two illustrates the situation .",
    "let us now specify the physical values of our time and space units . ignoring the possibility of existence of long vehicles such as buses , trucks etc , the length of each cell is taken to be as 4.5 metres which is the typical bumper - to - bumper distance of cars in a waiting queue .",
    "therefore the spatial grid @xmath24 equals to @xmath25 .",
    "we take the time step @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , we adopt a speed - limit of @xmath27 . the value of @xmath6 is so chosen to give the speed - limit value @xmath28 or equivalently @xmath29 . in this regard",
    ", @xmath6 is given by the integer party of @xmath30 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath31 , @xmath6 equals @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , each discrete increments of velocity signifies a value of @xmath33 which is also equivalent to the acceleration . for @xmath31",
    "this gives the comfort acceleration @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , we take the value of random breaking parameter at @xmath35 . in the next section ,",
    "the simulation results of the above - described dynamics is presented .",
    "the streets sizes are equally taken as @xmath36 and the system is update for @xmath37 time steps .",
    "after transients , two streets maintain steady - state currents , defined as the number of vehicles passing from a fixed location per a definite time interval , denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "they are functions of the global densities @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the number of vehicles in the first and the second street respectively .",
    "we kept the global density at a fixed value @xmath44 in the second street and varied @xmath45 .",
    "figure ( 3 ) exhibits the fundamental diagram of the first street i.e. ; @xmath38 versus @xmath45 .",

    "intersection of two chains makes the intersection point appear as a site - wise dynamical defective site .",
    "it is a well - known fact that a local defect can affect the low dimensional non - equilibrium systems on a global scale @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed not only for simple exclusion process but also for cellular automata models describing vehicular traffic flow @xcite .",
    "analogous to static defects , in our case of dynamical impurity , we observe that the effect of the site - wise dynamic defect is to form a plateau region @xmath49 $ ] in which @xmath50 is the extension of the plateau region in the fundamental diagram .",
    "the larger the density in the perpendicular chain is , the more strong is the dynamic defect . for higher @xmath44 ,",
    "the plateau region is wider and the current value is more reduced . after the plateau , @xmath38 exhibits linear decrease versus @xmath45 in the same manner as in the fundamental diagram of a single road . in this region which corresponds to @xmath51",
    "the intersecting road imposes no particular effect on the first road .",
    "increasing @xmath44 beyond @xmath48 gives rise to substantial changes in the fundamental diagram .",
    "contrary to the case @xmath52 , the abrupt drop of current after reaching its maximum disappears for @xmath53 and @xmath38 reaches its plateau value without showing any decrease .",
    "the length and height of the plateau does not show significant dependence for @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "this marks the efficiency of the non signalised controlling mechanism in which the current of each street is highly robust over the density variation in the perpendicular street .",
    "when @xmath44 exceeds @xmath55 , the plateau undergoes changes .",
    "its length increases whereas its height decreases .",
    "we now consider the flow characteristics in the second street .",

    "the road length is @xmath47 metre . , width=264 ]    for each value of @xmath44 , the current @xmath39 as a function of @xmath45 exhibits three regimes . in the first regime",
    "in which @xmath45 is small , @xmath39 is a decreasing function of @xmath45 .",
    "afterwards , @xmath39 reaches a plateau region ( second regime ) which is approximately extended over the region @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "eventually in the third regime , @xmath39 exhibits decreasing behaviour towards zero .",
    "analogous to @xmath38 , the existence of wide plateau regions indicates that street @xmath56 can maintain a constant flow capacity for a wide range of density variations in the first street .",
    "the other feature is that in fixed @xmath45 , @xmath39 is an increasing function for small values of @xmath44 .",
    "this is natural since the current in street @xmath56 has not reached its maximal value .",
    "this increment persists up to @xmath59 . beyond that , for each @xmath45 , @xmath39 saturates . in the plateau region ,",
    "the saturation value is slightly above @xmath60 .",
    "the current saturation continues up to @xmath61 above which @xmath39 again starts to decrease .",
    "we note that the behaviours depicted in @xmath62 and @xmath63 diagrams are consistent to each other . due to",
    "the existence of @xmath64 symmetry , the @xmath65 diagram is identical to @xmath62 and @xmath66 is identical to @xmath63 . in order to find a deeper insight , it would be illustrative to look at the behaviour of total current @xmath67 as a function of density in one of the streets . fig .",

    "however , for @xmath53 , the maximum shifts backward to @xmath72 . according to the above graphs , after a short increasing behaviour , @xmath70 enters into a lengthy plateau region .",
    "evidently for optimisation of traffic one should maximize the total current @xmath70 .",
    "the existence of a wide plateau region in @xmath70 suggests that yielding mechanism can be regarded as an efficient method in the plateau range of density in the first street .",

    "due to the same reason which was explained , smaller @xmath2 gives higher currents . in the case",
    "@xmath76 , the transition of @xmath39 from the plateau region to the linear decreasing segment is much smoother compared to the other values of @xmath2 greater than one . since the currents in the plateau region do not depend on density , therefore the higher acceleration gives rise to larger currents .",
