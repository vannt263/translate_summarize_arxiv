    "fibrin is a polymer made from the blood plasma precursor protein fibrinogen .",
    "fibrin forms a porous network of branching fibers that provides the scaffold of protective hemostatic blood clots and pathological obstructive thrombi .",
    "the structure and properties of the fibrin , including mechanical resilience to forces of blood flow and clot contraction , determine the course of pathological conditions , such as coronary heart disease , ischemic stroke , or bleeding @xcite .",
    "hence , the tensile and shear behaviors of fibrin networks have been studied for a long time @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies have also focused on the tensile properties of a single fibrin fiber including the molecular unfolding of fibrin molecules at large deformations @xcite .",
    "the tensile behavior of single fibrin fibers can be used as an input to network models to predict the tensile behavior of the networks .",
    "we did this recently using the eight - chain model and were able to predict the mechanics of fibrin networks under tension @xcite .",
    "the shear behavior of fibrin networks has also been studied both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . for networks with thin fibrin fibers the shear behavior",
    "can also be explained in terms of the entropic elasticity of single fibrin fibers @xcite .    even though tension and shear behaviors of fibrin networks have been studied in detail , compression of these networks",
    "remains largely unexplored .",
    "recently , kim _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite found that the non - linear stress - strain curves of fibrin networks in compression have three distinct regimes , similar to the curves observed in networks of carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "there is an initial linear response which is expected of any elastic solid for small strains , followed by a stress plateau that begins when fibers in the network start to buckle and continues until a majority of them have done so .",
    "then , network densification occurs creating a large number of contacts between the fibers as the stress increases steeply .",
    "this tri - phasic mechanical behavior could presumably be modeled using the theory of foams and other cellular solids @xcite as shown schematically in figure  [ pha ] . the initial shear and compression moduli of foams in the linear regime",
    "can be computed in terms of the young s modulus of the foam material and the geometric parameters of the foam @xcite .",
    "these moduli can also be connected to the moduli of fiber networks as has been done by @xcite .",
    "but , for large compressions these moduli are no longer sufficient and we must use more sophisticated theories .",
    "our goal in this paper is to further study the mechanical and structural responses of fibrin to compression by a combination of experiment and theory .",
    "in particular , from precise dynamic rheological and microscopic measurements we have developed a model for the compression behavior of fibrin networks based on the theory of foams and other cellular solids .",
    "first , the compression stress - strain curve was measured in experiment along with the loss and storage moduli at various strains with simultaneous 3d visualization of the fibrin network during the deformation .",
    "in addition to the non - linear behavior of storage and loss moduli , we were able to reveal the non - uniformity of the compressive deformation with formation of a `` compression front '' or `` phase boundary '' along the axis of compressive strain ( see figure  [ pha ] ) @xcite .",
    "next , we described how the non - linear rheological behavior could be explained by viewing the fibrin network as a `` cellular '' solid that could exist in two phases  the low - strain phase in which the fibers are mostly straight , and a high - strain phase in which the fibers are mostly buckled . in displacement - controlled experiments",
    "such a solid has a stress plateau when there is a mixture of both phases .",
    "the fraction of each phase at equilibrium is determined by a lever rule  @xcite .",
    "however , the storage and loss moduli at various degrees of compression in our fibrin networks were obtained in the experiments by performing small oscillations around a certain strain .",
    "these oscillations changed the fractions of the two phases but they were not necessarily quasi - static .",
    "we treated these two phases using a continuum theory of phase transitions in which a kinetic equation relates the rate of change of the fraction of the phases to the stress @xcite . in this way we explained the storage and loss moduli of the networks while accounting for the contributions of the moving phase boundary as well as the viscoelasticity of each phase .",
    "in this paper we first provide the details of the experimental procedures and present a description of the obtained data on controlled fibrin compression followed by a comprehensive theoretical analysis .",
    "after a short summary of the well - known results for cellular solids we show how this approach can be applied to fiber networks .",
    "we also describe the constitutive laws for fiber networks under large compression that have been studied using experiments and theory for several decades @xcite .",
    "we finally show how these results can be generalized and combined with a continuum theory for phase transitions to obtain the storage and loss moduli of networks under compression .",
    "the novelties of this paper are ( a ) experimental visualization of a propagating phase boundary in compressed fibrin networks , ( b ) an explanation for the trends in storage and loss moduli of the compressed networks in terms of a theory of phase transitions , and ( c ) first application of foam theory to a bio - polymer network .",

    "12 clots from various plasma samples were tested .",
    "the stepwise compression of the clots was performed in 25-@xmath9 m and 50-@xmath9 m steps at the rate of 30 @xmath9 m/s , as the downward force was applied by the upper rheometer plate on the top surface of the clot . in the other type of compression experiments",
    "the 150-@xmath9m - thick fibrin clots were formed in a flow chamber built of a microscope glass slide ( bottom ) and a glass cover slip ( top ) separated by an adhesive and highly plastic putty , which permitted irreversible compression of the clot samples within the chamber placed between the rheometer plates . in both types of experiments the fully polymerized and cross - linked plasma clots were compressed to a different degree followed by confocal microscopy .",

    "@xmath10 was defined as the absolute fractional decrease in fibrin clot thickness @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the initial and reduced thickness dimensions of the uncompressed and compressed clots , respectively .      changes of viscoelastic properties of fibrin clots during compression were measured by oscillating rheometry using a bohlin gemini rheometer ( malvern instruments , westborough , ma ) with parallel plate geometry .",

    "the oscillations were initiated immediately after each subsequent step of compression and lasted for 300 s. in each test , the storage ( @xmath16 ) and loss ( @xmath17 ) moduli were measured in combination with confocal microscopy of the fibrin clot structure .",

    "visual examination of the fluorescent confocal images of the fibrin clots during compression revealed marked non - uniformity of the network structure .",
    "here we define the xyz - coordinate system as z - axis along the vertical direction that is opposed to the applied compression .",
    "the xz - plane sections of the fibrin networks clearly showed the appearance and progression of a gradient in the fluorescence intensity in the direction of compression with a more or less sharp boundary between the areas with different intensities ( figure [ 3d ] ) . to precisely quantify the non - uniformity of the network density , we computationally reconstructed and analyzed the 3d images of a 150-@xmath9m - thick uncompressed fibrin clot and the same clot after 20@xmath15 and 50@xmath15 compression by segregating each image into 14 equal horizontal sublayers spanning the entire height of the network .",
    "the thickness of the sublayers at various degrees of compression was different depending on the height of the clot .",
    "we quantified the uniformity of network densification as the node density in each layer and plotted it against the distance from the bottom of the clot compressed from above ( figure [ phac ] ) .",
    "our results showed that during vertical compression of a fibrin network a much higher degree of node densification was observed closer to the top of a clot , while the node and network density decreased towards the bottom .",
    "the top , middle and bottom layers of the compressed clots are indicated in figure [ 3d ] and figure [ phac ] . as the degree of compression increased from @xmath23 to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the node density of the upper network layers increased by a factor of 1.8 and 2.3 , respectively . at the same degrees of compression ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) the node density of the middle layers of the network",

    "the density of the bottom portion of the network did not change at @xmath24 , but increased by 1.2 for @xmath26 as is apparent from the diffuse region near the bottom of the clot in figure  [ 3d ] ( right panel ) .",

    ", we also complemented the 3d structural analysis of compressed fibrin networks with an experiment to follow the displacement of microscopic fluorescent beads embedded into the network in response to clot compression .",
    "2-@xmath9 m polystyrene fluorescent beads were tracked during the compressive deformation in a clot volume of @xmath30 m in the bottom portion of the clot .",
    "the compression was applied in @xmath31 m steps . after each step we waited 2 minutes before measuring the displacements of the beads .",
    "we found that the beads position changed non - linearly in the z - direction as a function of compressive strain ( figure [ rd ] ) , indicating the non - uniform compression of the network . in the case of spatially uniform compression",
    ", one would expect to observe a linear displacement of beads with compression irrespective of their initial position and the distance from the bottom of a clot .",
    "however , in our experiments the beads exhibited less than 20@xmath15 relative displacements when the clot was exposed to compressive strains from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , but revealed a rapid descent toward the bottom of the clot at @xmath34 . to be more specific , when the compressive strain reached @xmath35 , the absolute distances changed by @xmath36 and @xmath37 m for the beads initially located at @xmath38 and @xmath39 m over the bottom , respectively . at a compressive strain of @xmath40 the bead , which was the closest to the bottom of the clot ,",
    "stopped moving because it had reached the surface .",
    "as the strain increased , other beads moved downwards until they also reached the bottom of the clot .",
    "the trajectory of all the beads turned downward at a similar compressive strain because they are all located within @xmath41 m of the bottom while compression is applied in @xmath31 m steps and the width of the front is about @xmath28 m ( see figure [ 3d ] and figure [ phac ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear response of bead displacement to network compression indicated that the deformation of the network occurred non - uniformly with the top layers being compressed earlier and stronger than the lower network portions . as a result",

    "such a front can be represented by a strain profile given as : @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the original height of a material point in the unstressed ( reference ) configuration , @xmath47 is the location of the center of the front in the unstressed configuration , and @xmath51 is the deformed height that is measured in the experiment .",

    "polystyrene fluorescent beads were tracked during the compressive deformation in a clot volume of @xmath64 in the bottom portion of the clot .",
    "densification occurs at the bottom of the clot only at high compressive strain , likely coinciding with the arrival of the compression front at the bottom . before the arrival of the compression front",
    "the density in the bottom of the clot remains almost independent of strain .",
    "this is what we expect in the plateau regime when the network consists of a mixture of two phases that accommodate the increasing compressive strain simply by advancing the compression front.,width=288 ]      structural alterations of fibrin network during compression underlie changes of shear viscoelasticity studied with rotational rheometry .",
    "the rheological measurements of fibrin clots with various initial shear storage and loss moduli were performed with two different compression steps ( 10 @xmath9 m and 25 @xmath9 m ) and at different degrees of compression .",
    "the experimental results are shown in figures [ ws ] and [ g ] in combination with the theoretical curves .",
    "the normal stress , calculated as the force distributed over the area of the smaller rheometer plate was measured for each degree of compression , and presented as the plots of normal stress , @xmath65 , versus compressive strain , @xmath10 ( figure [ ws ] ) .",
    "the curves were almost linear at lower degrees of compression with a steep increase of the normal stress at higher degrees of compression ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the evolution of the shear viscoelastic properties of fibrin networks in response to compressive deformation displayed a typical tri - phasic behavior ( figure [ g ] ) . in the beginning of compression ( @xmath67 ) , the shear elastic modulus of a fibrin network was almost constant followed by a long relative plateau up to about @xmath68 compressive strain and finally dramatic increase at the highest compressive strains .",
    "the loss modulus followed the same trend ( figure [ g ] ) .",
    "if the current rheological measurements are correlated with the structural analysis of the network dynamics performed earlier in @xcite , the results could be described as follows .",
    "first , a linear viscoelastic response to compression was observed , in which most fibers are straight . then , a plateau regime follows , accompanied by an increasing number of buckled fibers while the stress remains nearly constant as strain increases . finally , we see a regime in which network densification occurs with a stress - strain response that is markedly non - linear and dominated by bending of fibers after buckling and inter - fiber contact . in the next section",
    "we will quantify these observations using a model for foams .",
    "we emphasize that the experimental results reported here are substantially distinct from those reported earlier  @xcite because in addition to the confirmed non - linear response , we were able to reveal the non - uniformity of the compressive deformation with formation of a  compression front \" or  phase boundary \" along the axis of compressive strain ( see figure  [ phac ] )  @xcite .",
    "a foam is a porous low density structure consisting of cells or fibers made of a viscoelastic material . in our case",
    "these fibers are made of fibrin .",
    "if @xmath69 is young s modulus of a single fibrin fiber , then the young s modulus and shear modulus of the network or foam consisting of these fibers is given by @xcite : @xmath70 @xmath71 where the important non - dimensional quantity @xmath72 is the volume fraction of fibrin in the network , @xmath73 , @xmath59 , and @xmath74 are respectively the number of fiber segments per unit volume , fiber diameter and fiber segment length between branch points .",
    "@xmath75 is the initial fiber volume fraction before compression .",
    "these expressions are derived under the assumption of small strains so that the stress - strain relation of the foam can be approximated as linear .",
    "we will designate this phase of our fibrin network as the linear phase or the low - strain phase .",
    "when this network is loaded in compression fibers will buckle @xcite when a critical force is reached . from euler s formula , the critical axial load that causes fiber buckling is @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath74 are the young s modulus , area moment of inertia , and the length of the fiber between branch points , respectively .",
    "the coefficient @xmath78 is close to one and is determined by boundary conditions at the fiber ends .",
    "according to the analysis given in @xcite , @xmath78 is taken to be @xmath79 because the fiber lengh @xmath74 varies over a range in random networks .",
    "we can use this expression for the critical load to estimate the stress @xmath57 at which buckling of fibers begins in the network . according to @xcite , since , @xmath80 , we could write it as @xmath81 where the coefficient @xmath27 is assumed to be 0.04 in @xcite . the strain corresponding to the critical stress in the low - strain phase is easily computed as @xmath82 . another way to estimate",
    "@xmath83 is to use eqn .",
    "( [ fcr ] ) ",
    "@xmath84 where @xmath85 is fiber cross - sectional area .",
    "both these methods give an estimate of @xmath86 around @xmath87 and @xmath88 around 5 @xmath89 as shown in figure  [ pha ] for the parameters in the experiments shown in figures  [ ws ] and [ g ] .",
    "these ideas for estimating @xmath57 can only be justified if the fibers in the network are not undulating due to thermal motion .",
    "the extent of thermal undulations depends on the persistence length of the fibers and their length between branch - points .",
    "the persistence length of fibrin varies over a wide range depending on the conditions ( thrombin concentration , ph , calcilum concentration , etc.,@xcite ) under which a clot is made @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite summarizes several reasons in addition to fibrin assembly conditions ( such as , protein packing density , lateral binding between protofibrils .",
    "that result in the variation of fibrin persistence length . for our fibrin networks , which have been derived from plasma clots ,",
    "the average diameter of the fibers is about @xmath90 nm @xcite , which together with a young s modulus @xmath91mpa @xcite gives a persistence length @xmath92 at room temperature about 1 m . the length @xmath74 between branch points is about @xmath93 m , on average .",
    "thus , thermal fluctuations of the fibers are negligible , consistent with the assumption for foams .    when large compressive strain is applied to a fibrin network the total volume decreases considerably and the inter - fiber space is reduced .",
    "in this configuration a linear stress - strain relation is not applicable any more .",
    "the fibers are mostly buckled and forced to touch each other .",
    "we call this kind of configuration the  densified phase \" or the high - strain phase .",
    "this sort of densified network has been studied by toll @xcite who showed that the number of contact points @xmath94 per unit volume is an increasing function of fiber volume fraction @xmath95 and was given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a scalar invariant of the fiber orientation distribution function and is equal to @xmath98 for three dimensional isotropic networks @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , in the densified phase we assume the fiber volume fraction @xmath99 . in other words , all the volume change is due to the reduction in the thickness of the network in the direction of the compressive force with no change in the cross - sectional area .",
    "our experiments indicate that this is a good approximation .",
    "we compared eqn .",
    "( [ nc ] ) to the experimental data on contact point density @xmath94 from @xcite and found that it indeed varied quadratically with the fiber volume fraction @xmath95 as shown in figure  [ phac ] .",
    "the stress - strain relation for such a network was proposed by van - wyk @xcite and toll @xcite in the following form : @xmath100 where the coefficient @xmath101 is determined by the material and loading conditions .",
    "it is found to be less than @xmath79 , as in @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath78 was analytically derived to be @xmath102 from eqn .",
    "( [ nc ] ) for three - dimensional random networks in @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by several experiments @xcite . from eqn .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , we can compute the local tangent moduli of the network in the densified regime .",
    "the tangent modulus at any strain in the densified regime is directly proportional to the storage modulus in the rotational rheometer oscillation experiments .",
    "following the linear theory for foams at small strains we assume that the ratio between this storage modulus and the local tangent modulus in the densified regime is @xmath103 ( see eqns .",

    "this is also consistent with our experimentally motivated assumption above that vertical compression of the fibrin network does not change its cross - sectional area . for the plateau stress @xmath105 , we find that the young s and shear moduli are @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the strain at which @xmath109",

    "@xmath113 is the transformation strain which can be estimated by constructing the tangent to the stress - strain curve at @xmath114 and reading off the intercept on the @xmath10 axis as shown in figure  [ pha ] .",
    "if we assume that the process of loading is quasi - static so that the sample stays in equilibrium during the compression process , then the compressive strain @xmath10 in the plateau corresponding to the stress @xmath57 is obtained simply by changing the fraction of fibers buckled .",
    "if we denote the fraction of fibrin in the high strain phase as @xmath115 $ ] , then total strain can be estimated from the insight that the sample consists of two ` springs ' in series consisting of the straight and densified network respectively as observed in figure  [ 3d ] .",
    "@xmath116 this completes the description of the stress - strain curve for a fibrin network under compression . as an example we have plotted this stress - strain curve for a fibrin network with network parameters experimentally measured in kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in figure [ phac ] .",
    "we have used values of the fiber young s modulus @xmath117 = 5 mpa  @xcite .",
    "the stresses in figure  [ phac ] are of the same magnitude as the measured storage moduli in figure  [ g ] .",
    "however , the stress strain curve in figure  [ ws ] does not have an initial linear regime for small strains even though it seems to have a flat plateau regime for intermediate strains and a regime with steeply increasing stress for high strains .",
    "furthermore , the shear moduli measured in figure  [ g ] are at least three orders of magnitude lower than those seen in the normal stress data plotted in figure  [ ws ] .",
    "this indicates that figure [ ws ] is not a true reflection of the stress strain response of the network ; rather it is the result of water squeezing out of the network in response to compression . to understand why this is the case",
    "we must account for the strain - rate dependence of the mechanical response of these fibrin gels .",
    "the fibrin networks that have been tested in our experiments really are gels that contain a large amount of water .",
    "as the gel is compressed , water is squeezed out . however , as it is sheared , water is not squeezed out because the total volume does not change .",
    "hence , it is expected that the measured normal stresses in compression will depend on the applied strain rates .",
    "this effect is well - known as poro - viscoelasticity in foams and other cellular solids @xcite .",
    "an analytic relation for the stress as a function of the applied strain rate is given as @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath9 is dynamic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath10 and @xmath119 are the compressive strain and its rate , @xmath120 is horizontal dimension of the foam sample , and @xmath74 is the cell edge - length of the foam .",
    "the coefficient @xmath121 is about unity .",
    "as shown in figure  [ ws ] , the measured normal stress during compression can be captured by eqn .",
    "( [ cs ] ) with the parameters @xmath122 pa@xmath123s ( for water ) , @xmath124 mm ( known from our experimental set - up ) and @xmath74 as the only fitting parameter for each experiment . the strain rate for each experiment is different because the height of the samples varies while the rate of compression ( @xmath28 m/s , see section 2.3 ) remains fixed for each experiment .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath74 appear in table [ fitting ] .",
    "they are within the range of variation of fiber lengths between branch points seen in experiments  @xcite .",
    "we see that most of the normal stress measured in the experiments is due to the expulsion of water from the fibrin gel .",
    "hence , the storage and loss moduli measured in our rheometer experiments and shown in figure  [ g ] can not be extracted from the stress - strain curves shown in figure  [ ws ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     from eqn ( [ cs ] ) , we can approximate the viscosity of the gel for small strains ( infinitesimal values of @xmath10 ) as @xmath125 however , the viscous losses due to this term can not be measured in the rotational rheometer experiments because the derivation of this expression assumes that the volume of the network is changing while the oscillatory experiments are performed in shear which involves no change in volume .",
    "therefore , the loss modulus in the low strain phase should only come from the liquid viscosity itself . for water , this is merely @xmath126 pa@xmath123s , which is much smaller than the value obtained from ( [ eq : esti ] ) .",
    "therefore , we treat the fibrin network in the low strain phase as a purely elastic solid with constant modulus .",
    "another important network property that is related to the strain rate is the inter - fiber friction .",
    "this is particularly important in the densified phase in which a large number of contacts are created between fibers .",
    "fibers sliding against each other while in contact will cause dissipation in the network . in order to estimate the viscosity associated with this process we appeal to an elegant calculation in @xcite .",
    "this book gives an explanation for the molecular basis of  viscosity \" due to the forming and breaking of bonds as molecules slide past each other .",
    "the expression is : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the inter - molecular bond energy and @xmath129 the average life - time of a bond .",
    "an expression for @xmath94 as a function of fibrin volume fraction is already given in eqn .",
    "( [ nc ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are difficult to determine for fibrin fibers .",
    "some work along this direction has been done for estimating the viscous losses in microtubule networks  @xcite , but here we treat the product @xmath130 as a fitting parameter . in summary , we model the densified network at @xmath110 ( for small strains ) as a kelvin - voigt solid  @xcite in which the stress - strain relation is given as : @xmath131 where the parameters @xmath132 and @xmath133 are taken from eqns ( [ e22 ] ) and ( [ eq : etahigh ] ) . in the rotational rheometer experiments",
    "the loss modulus is related to this viscosity as : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is frequency of oscillation .",
    "the loss modulus for both the low- and high - strain phases can be determined using this formula if we use @xmath136pa@xmath123s ( of water ) for the low - strain phase and eqn.([eq : etahigh ] ) for the high - strain phase . in order to estimate the loss modulus in the plateau regime of the stress - strain curve we need to account for the rate at which the fractions of the two phases evolve .",
    "this is explained in the next section .              in the oscillation experiments ,",
    "the fraction of each phase depends on both applied strain and strain rate .",
    "as shown in figure  [ pha ] , the phase boundary is expected to oscillate as the applied loading oscillates .",
    "we treat this process in a one - dimensional model as follows .",
    "after pre - compressing the sample , we assume that the oscillation is also in the axial direction .",
    "this is different from the experiments in which an oscillating shear strain is applied on the pre - compressed networks .",
    "however , since the oscillating shear strains applied in the experiments are small , we can assume that they will give storage and loss moduli that are proportional to those obtained in our calculations .    during the oscillation process",
    "the sample may not be in equilibrium and thus the stress may not be @xmath57 .",
    "there will be oscillation in stress , phase fractions , as well as strain .",
    "we assume that the fraction @xmath137 is determined by the kinetics of transformation as in @xcite .",

    "fibrin networks are compressed  @xcite . the phase boundary and several other features quantifying the structural non - uniformity of fibrin networks under compression were revealed by our 3d microscopy studies . because of the complexity of the analysis , non - uniform fibrin networks under loads have not been previously quantified .",
    "however , it is clear that under physiological conditions fibrin networks are frequently exposed to dynamic forces , which would result in non - isotropy and structural heterogeneities . since in many cases ,",
    "fibrin networks participate in the permeation of blood clotting factors @xcite , variations in fibrin matrix density can affect the spatial - temporal distribution of factors and hence , alter their biochemical interaction .",
    "our results indicate that even a uniform compression can produce structural gradients in fibrin networks , therefore , suggesting a non - uniform alteration of fibrin matrix transport properties with compression .",
    "it is also worth noting that the mechanical response of fibrin networks under compression is dominated by fiber buckling and subsequent bending and is therefore non - affine .",
    "this is in contrast to the stress - strain response in tension and shear where the assumption of affine deformations worked quite well  @xcite .",
    "this assumption is particularly good for rubbers and other polymeric materials @xcite , and it works for fibrin networks under tension because the unfolding of the proteins results in cross - linked polymer chains much like those in rubber .",
    "it works well for shear of a network of thin fibrin fibers because such a network is not very different from cross - linked fluctuating polymer chains @xcite .",
    "however , in compression the initial linear regime is governed by fiber bending instead of fiber stretching .",
    "thus , we can no longer assume affine deformations .",
    "this is apparent in the non - linear dependence of the initial young s modulus in compression @xmath184 on the fibrin volume fraction @xmath95 ( see eqn . ( [ e1 ] ) )",
    ". the dependence would be linear if the deformations were affine as in tension and shear . since @xmath185 our model predicts that @xmath186 where @xmath73 is fiber density , @xmath59 is average fiber diameter and @xmath74 is average fiber length .",
    "our prediction can be tested in experiments since @xmath73 , @xmath59 and @xmath74 can be controlled by changing the polymerization conditions of the fibrin networks . in the densified network",
    "buckled fibers are in contact , so the assumption of affine deformations is not expected to work .",
    "indeed , the stress - strain response depends on @xmath95 in a complex way that has been quantified both with experiments and theory in the textile literature  @xcite .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the same ideas can quantitatively capture the compression response of densified fibrin networks with an appropriate choice of fiber geometrical and material parameters .",
    "for example , at large compressive strains our model predicts that the tangent modulus in the densified phase @xmath187 where @xmath75 is the initial fiber volume fraction .",
    "this prediction can be tested since @xmath73 , @xmath59 , @xmath74 and @xmath10 can all be controlled in experiments .",
    "similarly , our physically motivated constitutive law eqns .",
    "( [ eq : etahigh ] ) and ( [ nc ] ) that accounts for the inter - fiber friction and captures the viscous response of densified fibrin networks can also be tested in experiments .",
    "we have already demonstrated the importance of the strain - rate dependence in the compressive response of fibrin networks by using poroelastic constitutive laws that govern the flow of water in cellular solids .    in this work",
    "the structural alterations in response to compression were studied at the microscopic level of a network .",
    "we have shown that structural non - uniformity manifests itself as a  compression front \" or  phase boundary \" separating regions in the network where fibers are straight from another regime where the fibers are buckled .",
    "while such a front has been visualized in many macroscopic  @xcite and microscopic foams  @xcite we are not aware of attempts where its motion is treated using a theory of phase transitions  @xcite to obtain the storage and loss moduli .",
    "we have demonstrated in this work that a continuum theory of phase transitions can predict the rheological properties of fibrin networks under large deformations if we properly account for the dissipative motion of the phase boundary .",
    "it is likely that a similar model can be applied to other foams or foam - like materials since propagating interfaces have been visualized in them .",
    "the idea of a phase transition was also used in our earlier work on the tensile behavior of fibrin networks  @xcite .",
    "the difference here is that we have no evidence of forced molecular unfolding of the protein .",
    "however , fibrin has a complex multidimensional structure and it has been shown that compression of a hydrated fibrin clot is accompanied by changes in the @xmath6-helical coiled - coils , namely the transition of @xmath6-helix to @xmath188-sheet revealed using ftir spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "however , a comparative analysis shows that the changes in the secondary structure of fibrin were observed at compressive stresses ( @xmath189 ) that are orders of magnitude higher than those applied in our work ( figure  [ ws ] ) .",
    "it is likely that molecular structural transitions observed in a protein at very high degrees of compression results from its mechanical destruction , not reached in our present experiments .",
    "the aggregate of data suggests that at the degrees of deformation , not leading to complete disorganization of a filamentous network , compressive load is accommodated mainly by the structural changes in fiber arrangements at the network level .",
    "these changes include buckling , stretching , and formation of oblique contacts of individual fibers as well as overall network densification .",
    "it is noteworthy that the structural changes underlying compressive deformation of the networks are spatially non - uniform and form a stepped gradient along the axis of compression .",
    "although we observed a single compressive front in our experiments that originated at the boundary of our sample , this is by no means necessary .",
    "fronts can be nucleated in the interior of the network at a site of stress concentration or low network density .",
    "this prediction can also be tested since it is possible to visualize moving fronts as we show in our experiments .",
    "fibrin deformability has become a rapidly developing area not only in the study of the mechanics of filamentous networks , but also in various practical biomedical applications .",
    "first , studies of compression of fibrin networks provide a basis for understanding what happens to salutary hemostatic clots and pathological obstructive thrombi _ in vivo _",
    ", when they are subject to natural deformations .",
    "there is a number of conceivable patho - physiological conditions , in which fibrin networks can experience compressive loads : vasoconstriction , arterial hydrodynamic blood flow , clot contraction , pulsation of a vessel wall or aneurism , muscular pressure , cardiac beats for intracardiac thrombi , lung motion during breathing , etc .",
    "next , fibrin has been widely used as a sealant in surgery and its hemostatic efficiency strongly depends on the ability to withstand mechanical loads , including compression .",
    "finally , fibrin has been well - known for various tissue engineering applications in combination with cells and with other materials to replace damaged or diseased organs and tissues @xcite . mechanical and structural insights into fibrin deformability in combination with a theoretical framework of studying fibrin mechanics provide a foundation for developing new treatment modalities .",

    "after carefully reading their paper , we provide a summary of the points of similarity and differences between the two papers below .    1 .   both papers study , by a combination of experiment and theory , the compression behavior of fibrous materials .",
    "they both show that the measured stress - strain curve has three regimes  a linear regime , plateau regime , and densified regime  typical of foams @xcite .",
    "however , the scott industrial foam studied in @xcite is a macroscopic reticulated open cell synthetic foam with a definite pore size , while the fibrin studied in @xcite is a microscopic isotropic network of natural fibers with a distribution of lengths and pore sizes that has not been examined in the context of theories for foams and cellular solids . 2 .",
    "both papers show experimentally that in the plateau regime regions of densified material ( with inter - fiber contact ) co - exist with rarefied material , and the fraction of densified material increases with increasing strain in the plateau regime . in @xcite",
    "the bands of localized compression observed in experiments were viewed as regions of discontinuous strains alternating between two distinct values @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "in @xcite we visualized a moving  compression front \" with densified material on top and rarefied material in the bottom .",
    "in addition , we showed that this front starts at the top of the sample and reaches the bottom at compressive strains greater than 0.6 .",
    "both papers argue that the plateau in the stress - strain curve can be theoretically explained by accounting for the co - existence of the rarefied and densified phases of material at the same stress @xmath65 , but distinct values of the stretch @xmath205 in each phase .",
    "et al._@xcite argued that their strain discontinuities are analogous to phase boundaries in continuum theories of phase transitions , and that minimization of total potential energy in the presence of these phase boudaries leads to the stress plateau . without prior knowledge of the work in @xcite we explained the plateau in the stress - strain curve of compressed fibrin by the quasistatic motion of the  compression front \" , or phase boundary , visualized in our experiments .",
    "both papers point out that some of the energy dissipation observed in experiments can be partly attributed to the dissipative motion of phase boundaries .",
    "while this was a qualitative statement in @xcite we have quantitatively deduced a mobility parameter for phase boundaries in compressed fibrin networks by fitting our measurements of the storage and loss moduli at various compressions with analytical expressions derived using a continuum theory of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "both papers point out that the phase boundary is not a sharp interface but has a thickness over which there is a large gradient in the strain @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was observed that the width of the bands depended on cell size .",
    "the authors mentioned that the length scale of the bands could be accounted for via models which incorporate strain gradients .",
    "in @xcite we quantitatively fit the strain profile observed in our experiments with analytical expressions derived from an augmented theory of phase transitions incorporating strain gradients @xcite .",
    "we show that the thickness of the phase boundary is many times larger than the average length of a fiber between branch points .",

    "<S> the rheological properties of fibrin networks have been of long - standing interest . as such </S>",
    "<S> there is a wealth of studies of their shear and tensile responses , but their compressive behavior remains unexplored . here , by characterization of the network structure with synchronous measurement of the fibrin storage and loss moduli at increasing degrees of compression , we show that the compressive behavior of fibrin networks is similar to that of cellular solids . </S>",
    "<S> a non - linear stress - strain response of fibrin consists of three regimes : 1 ) an initial linear regime , in which most fibers are straight , 2 ) a plateau regime , in which more and more fibers buckle and collapse , and 3 ) a markedly non - linear regime , in which network densification occurs by bending of buckled fibers and inter - fiber contacts . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the spatially non - uniform network deformation included formation of a moving  compression front \" along the axis of strain , which segregated the fibrin network into compartments with different fiber densities and structure . </S>",
    "<S> the young s modulus of the linear phase depends quadratically on the fibrin volume fraction while that in the densified phase depends cubically on it . </S>",
    "<S> the viscoelastic plateau regime corresponds to a mixture of these two phases in which the fractions of the two phases change during compression . </S>",
    "<S> we model this regime using a continuum theory of phase transitions and analytically predict the storage and loss moduli which are in good agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> our work shows that fibrin networks are a member of a broad class of natural cellular materials which includes cancellous bone , wood and cork . </S>"
