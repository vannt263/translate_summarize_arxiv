    "we consider heat transport in mass disordered harmonic lattices with stochastic bulk dynamics . for the @xmath1 disordered harmonic lattice without stochasticity the effect of localization due to disorder leads , in the presence of pinning , to an exponential decay of the heat current as a function of the length @xcite .",
    "in the absence of pinning the conductivity depends on the boundary conditions either growing as @xmath2 or decaying as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the situation is very different when one adds stochasticity to the dynamics .",

    "the stochastic part of the bulk dynamics consists of random reversals of each particle s velocity at a rate @xmath0 .",
    "the analytical as well as accurate numerical tractability of this model makes it a good test system to address the problem of the effect of noisy dynamics on transport properties of disordered systems . to the extent that stochastic dynamics affect phonon - phonon interactions in some rough sense similar to anharmonicity",
    ", this may also teach us something about the effects of the latter .",
    "the effect of interactions on localization and transport in disordered systems has generated much interest and has been studied both for the case of electron and phonon transport @xcite  .",
    "a study by two of us @xcite of the heat conductivity of the disordered 1d pinned lattice with anharmonicity found that a small amount of anharmonicity was sufficient to cause a transition to a diffusive regime with a finite value of @xmath4 . the question of whether the transition from an insulator to conductor occurs at zero or some finite small value of anharmonicity remains an open problem . for the noisy dynamics on the other hand @xcite shows that an arbitrarily small noise leads to normal transport .",
    "the work of @xcite suggests a transition at zero nonlinearity for classical systems ( the quantum situation may be different ) .",
    "there have been some recent studies @xcite on the ness of ordered harmonic chains with noisy dynamics conserving both energy and momentum , and with white noise langevin baths at different temperatures at the two ends .",
    "it was shown in these studies that the time - evolution of the pair - correlations formed closed sets of equations .",
    "this closure is true also for the energy conserving model that we study .",

    "has to be to have agreement between the different bcs .",
    "this leaves open the question of what happens if we first let @xmath5 and then make the noise strength go to zero . ] finally we conclude with a discussion of the nature of the ness for this model .",
    "while it is easily checked that the ness is not strictly gaussian , we find that the one particle momentum and position distributions are very close to gaussian distribution .",
    "furthermore their values at different sites or of momentum and position at the same site are essentially uncorrelated .",

    "computer simulations however indicate that the single particle distributions are very close to a single gaussian while the joint distribution of @xmath178 and @xmath179 or of @xmath179 and @xmath180 , @xmath181 , are essentially uncorrelated .",
    "in addition , the set of equations for the four variable correlation functions was derived and for small values of n , they were solved numerically .",
    "the exact values obtained from these numerics were found to be in close match with the simulation results . for n=4 , and @xmath182 , the results from the numerical solution are shown in table i corresponding to 3 different values of @xmath0 .",
    "it was also observed that these normalized forms of correlations ( that go to zero when the temperatures of the two reservoirs are equal or when there is no velocity flipping ) have a limit when either the difference in temperature ( @xmath183 ) or strength of stochastic noise ( @xmath0 ) goes to infinity .",
    "when we let @xmath184 , we observed that the correlations involving p1 and p4 went to zero .",
    "+   + we are currently investigating the @xmath185 corrections to the pair correlations in the noisy ness .",
    "these are known to behave like @xmath186 for certain diffusive lattice systems and to contribute terms of @xmath185 beyond those obtained from the local equilibrium to the variance of the particle number in the ness .",
    "results of this kind are also known partially for the continuum case with a different kind of noise , i.e instead of velocity reversals pairs of nearest neighbor particles diffuse on the circle @xmath187 .",
