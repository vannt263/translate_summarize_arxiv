    "the recent observation by lhcb  @xcite of prominent exotic structures @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the @xmath7 spectrum of @xmath10 has rekindled hopes that the long - sought pentaquark states have finally been observed .",
    "the reported properties are @xmath11  mev , @xmath12  mev ( at 9 standard deviations ) and @xmath13  mev , @xmath14  mev ( at 12 standard deviations ) , respectively , while the preferred @xmath15 assignments are correlated , with the most likely combinations in decreasing order being @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .    should at least one of the states be confirmed by another experiment , it will join the famed tetraquarks  whose best - studied member [ the @xmath19 @xmath20 was discovered over a decade ago  @xcite  as a second class of exotic hadrons . since the valence structure of @xmath7 is @xmath21 , the minimal quark content of such states",
    "is that of a pentaquark .",
    "we note several interesting phenomenological facts .",
    "first , the two charged _ five_-quark hidden - charm states @xmath2 and @xmath3 observed at lhcb are both lighter than the _",
    "four_-quark state @xmath22 [ formerly @xmath23 observed by the same group  @xcite . since pentaquarks carry baryon number and therefore must have a baryon in their decay products , while tetraquarks are bosons and therefore can decay entirely to ( generically lighter ) mesons , less phase space is typically available to @xmath6 decays .",
    "in particular , @xmath22 decays dominantly to @xmath24 , even though plenty of phase space is available for the @xmath25 mode , while neither of the @xmath6 states is kinematically allowed to decay to @xmath26 .",
    "second , both of the @xmath6 states lie well above the thresholds for decay into @xmath27 , which also has the valence - quark structure @xmath21 . since these two - body decays are not forbidden by any obvious quantum number , the relatively small @xmath6 widths suggest interesting internal structure sufficient to suppress this immediate rearrangement , as well as that into @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath3 lies only about 10  mev below the @xmath29 threshold , which can be used to argue for a molecular interpretation  @xcite .",
    "alternate molecular assignments for the @xmath6 states are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the origin of the @xmath3 as a threshold rescattering effect via @xmath30 is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and through additional channels in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "third , all of the preferred fits from lhcb demand that the two @xmath6 states carry opposite parities .",
    "a system of four quarks and one antiquark in a relative @xmath31 wave has negative parity , while positive parity requires the introduction of at least one unit of relative orbital angular momentum ( @xmath32 wave or higher ) . and",
    "yet , the two @xmath6 states are separated by only @xmath33  mev .",
    "one may argue that the figure of merit , as would be the case for regge trajectories , should be @xmath34 , which is a much more natural hadronic scale ; however , attempting to discern a trajectory when only two points are available seems absurdly premature .",
    "still , if the @xmath35 state @xmath36 seen by belle with a mass @xmath37  mev  @xcite is confirmed , then small mass splittings between hidden - charm exotics of opposite parities [ _ i.e. _ , only 20  mev from the @xmath20and hence relative orbital excitations  will not appear unusual .    in this short paper",
    ", we propose a structure for the @xmath6 states based upon a mechanism recently proposed for understanding the tetraquark states  @xcite , wherein a diquark @xmath38 and an antidiquark @xmath39 form in the attractive color-@xmath40 and color-@xmath41 representations , respectively .",
    "this configuration is prevented from instantly reorganizing into two @xmath42 pairs because the diquarks are forced to separate rapidly due to the large energy release in the production mechanism ( _ e.g. _ , a @xmath43-meson decay via @xmath44 ) .",
    "however , since the diquarks are colored , they are confined and hence can not separate indefinitely ; kinetic energy is converted into the potential energy of a color flux tube connecting them .",
    "hadronization finally occurs through the overlap of the long - distance tails of hadronic wave functions that stretch from the quarks in @xmath38 to the antiquarks in @xmath45 .",
    "this picture was used to explain , for example , the preference for @xmath46 over @xmath47 , simply due to the final spatial separation of the @xmath48 in @xmath38 and the @xmath49 in @xmath39 allowing a much greater wave function overlap with the larger @xmath50 than with the more compact @xmath51 .",
    "we argued implicitly in  @xcite , and explicitly in a subsequent paper  @xcite , that the diquarks formed from one heavy and one light quark are somewhat smaller than diquarks formed from two light quarks , and that such heavy - light @xmath52 diquarks are not expected to be much larger than the meson @xmath53 formed from the same flavors . in",
    "yet another subsequent paper  @xcite , we proposed that the preferential coupling of @xmath54 ( and its conjugate ) does not end with diquarks , but can continue sequentially to more complex structures like pentaquarks and even octoquarks .",
    "these ideas will be used to develop the pentaquark picture described in detail below . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the term `` picture '' because many distinct models could be constructed that support this dynamics , and want to emphasize that this discussion is not limited to any particular choice of potential or wave functions , for example .    the concept that pentaquarks might be formed from two compact colored constituents rather than molecules of mesons",
    "was first expressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which sought to describe the @xmath55 pentaquark candidate @xmath56 as a molecule of a @xmath57 diquark in a color-@xmath58 and a @xmath59 `` triquark '' ( a term coined in that paper ) formed from a @xmath57 diquark in a color-@xmath60 coupled to the @xmath61 quark into an overall color-@xmath41 .",
    "the separation of the two components of the molecule is stabilized by the centrifugal barrier introduced by relative orbital angular momentum @xmath62 , which as discussed above was necessary should the @xmath63 have been found to carry positive parity . in comparison , the famous @xmath63 pentaquark model of ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a structure of two light @xmath57 diquarks and one exceptional ( @xmath61 ) quark . both refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , make use of diquarks consisting of light quarks in the `` good '' ( spin-0 ) combinations , so named because they are believed to be more tightly bound than the `` bad '' ( spin-1 ) combination through hyperfine couplings ( although in ref .  @xcite the diquark inside the triquark has spin 1 ) . in the case of heavy - light diquarks ,",
    "the hyperfine couplings are proportional to @xmath64 , and therefore the mass difference between `` good '' and `` bad '' is greatly reduced .",
    "alternate compositions through colored components have been very recently discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : diquark ] we discuss the diquark picture used to describe the new exotic states .",
    "section  [ sec : pentapic ] presents the diquark picture as relevant to the production of the @xmath6 states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phenom ] we present the basic phenomenology for the @xmath6 states provided by this picture , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize .",
    "the color algebra of qcd provides more than one way to obtain attractive channels between quarks .",
    "the combination @xmath65 , which explains the strong binding of @xmath66 pairs in conventional mesons , is of course extremely well known .",
    "however , one other binary combination is strongly binding , the channel @xmath54 . to quantify the effect , note that the coupling of two colored objects in the irreducible representations @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "is computed by the same techniques as one computes the spin coupling between objects carrying spins @xmath69 and @xmath70 combining to total spin @xmath71 , via the trick @xmath72 \\ , .\\ ] ] one generalizes to an arbitrary lie algebra by computing the combination of quadratic casimirs @xmath73 considering all binary combinations @xmath74 and @xmath75 , one computes the relative strengths @xmath76 the diquark attractive @xmath58 channel @xmath38 is therefore fully half as strong as that of the singlet @xmath77 channel . in a multiquark system in which two quarks or two antiquarks happen to lie in closer proximity than to one of their antiparticles ,",
    "the diquark @xmath38 ( antidiquark @xmath39 ) attraction is naturally expected to dominate .",
    "unless stronger color forces intervene ( _ e.g. _ , the production of nearby @xmath78 s , which would create available color - singlet combinations ) , the @xmath38 and @xmath39 combinations can be expected to form quasi - bound , but colored and therefore confined , states .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the diquarks containing a charm and a light quark were crudely estimated to have a comparable size to a @xmath79 meson , roughly @xmath80  fm .",
    "the subsequent paper ref .",
    "@xcite argued that diquarks formed with a heavy quark should be somewhat smaller than those formed from two light quarks : a heavier quark is more localized in space , while each lighter quark has a more diffuse wave function .",
    "a key phenomenological question in identifying whether diquarks have formed is whether or not any antiquarks appear within this radius .",
    "this hypothesis was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to suggest a means by which multiquark exotics could be produced , particularly at threshold , where the limited phase space allows the soft heavy quark pairs such as @xmath81 to coalesce with light valence quarks moving at similar rapidities .",
    "such multiquark states can be formed through a sequence of two - body bound - state clusters of color-@xmath58 diquark and color-@xmath41 antidiquark states . in the absence of easy opportunities for the formation of color singlets ,",
    "sequential diquark formation provides the strongest channels for binding .",
    "for example , anti - de  sitter / qcd models on the light front  @xcite have a universal confining potential that confirms the importance of diquarks in hadron spectroscopy . while the examples given in ref .",
    "@xcite describe literal clusters of diquarks such as a charmed , charge @xmath82 , baryon - number @xmath83 state @xmath84_{\\bar 3c } [ cu]_{\\bar 3c } [ uu]_{\\bar 3c}$ ] , another route of sequential color - triplet ( antitriplet ) formation is available , which is the hypothesis of this paper : a pre - existing diquark @xmath85 that subsequently encounters an antiquark @xmath86 forms a bound _ antitriquark _ @xmath87 via the attractive color coupling @xmath88 .",
    "this mechanism , as discussed in the next section , provides a completely analogous production channel for pentaquark states to that described for tetraquark states in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to say that two quarks or antiquarks encountering one another combine only into the most attractive channel is of course a great simplification .",
    "first , the color coupling factors apply without reservations only when fundamental qcd interactions dominate the interaction .",
    "longer - distance effects dress the interactions and can obfuscate this simple result . in reality",
    ", one expects a type of thermodynamic ensemble of states in various color combinations , in which the levels at the lowest energies are driven by diquark binding .",
    "the existence of such an ensemble assumes that the formation of overall color singlets is precluded due to the presence of a potential energy barrier , such as from a large spatial separation between the quarks needed to form the singlets . in that case , the eventual hadronization can be considered as a tunneling process .",
    "second , the pauli exclusion principle must be taken into account if the purported diquarks contain quarks of identical flavor , since then the flavor wave function is automatically symmetric , and therefore the color - spin wave function must be antisymmetric . in the specific example discussed below , this constraint is not an issue , but it must be kept in mind for other cases .",
    "we propose that the states @xmath6 observed at lhcb are pentaquarks consisting of a confined but rapidly separating pair of a color-@xmath40 diquark @xmath89 and a color-*3 * antitriquark @xmath90 , in which the @xmath57 subsystem of @xmath91 is a color-@xmath58 diquark @xmath85 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc ] .     attracted by long - range color forces ( indicated by gluon lines ) via a color flux tube . here",
    ", the mechanism is illustrated for @xmath92 , where the black square indicates the @xmath93-quark weak decay.,width=345 ]    this picture is completely analogous to ( the charge conjugate of ) that for the @xmath94 presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , except that the diquark @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc ] is replaced by the single quark @xmath96 .",
    "the parent hadron for the @xmath6 is the @xmath97 baryon , while the parent hadron for the @xmath98 is the @xmath99 . in either case , the composite state is not a molecule in the traditional sense of the word , because it lasts only as long as the @xmath38-@xmath100 pair ( @xmath38-@xmath39 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) possess positive kinetic energy to continue separating .",
    "the colored @xmath38 and @xmath100 constituents create a color flux tube between them , losing their energy to the color field and slowing down . for this picture to be physically meaningful , the @xmath38-@xmath100 pair must be sufficiently compact that their wave function overlap becomes insignificant . as in the standard wentzel - kramers - brillouin approximation ,",
    "the probability of a transition  in this case , hadronization  increases as the components approach the classical turning point .",
    "let us emphasize the differences between this and other pictures for the pentaquark .",
    "first , it is clearly different from the hadronic molecule picture , in which the constituent baryon and meson are color singlets treated as forming a static molecule and are held together by weak color van der waals forces .",
    "it is also different from the diquark - triquark model of ref .",
    "@xcite , not only because the diquarks are always assumed here to form color triplets , but also because the diquark - triquark state in that case is again a static molecule , stabilized by a centrifugal barrier ; in our picture , such states are expected to last only as long as the components continue to separate , and also would exist in @xmath31 waves as well as higher partial waves . the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite describes the @xmath6 states as being formed of diquarks , via the composition @xmath101 ; while the color structure is the same as ours , we emphasize the importance of the @xmath49 belonging to a compact component of the overall state .",
    "the new ingredient for the @xmath6 as compared to the @xmath94 is the use of the intrinsic diquark @xmath95 originating in the @xmath97 .",
    "note from fig .",
    "[ fig : pc ] that @xmath85 acts as a spectator in the @xmath6 production process .",
    "@xmath102 baryons have always had a special place in the history of diquark models , because these baryons by definition are isosinglets , and since the heavy quarks @xmath103 are also isosinglets , the remaining quark pair @xmath57 also forms an isosinglet , with a wave function that is antisymmetric under flavor exchange . since @xmath104 is a color-*3",
    "* , @xmath57 is a color @xmath58 , again an antisymmetric combination .",
    "the pauli principle therefore demands an antisymmetric spin wave function for @xmath57 . since both the ground - state @xmath102 baryons and the heavy quarks @xmath104 have @xmath105 , the @xmath57 is therefore expected to live in the antisymmetric spin-0 combination . the @xmath57 pair in @xmath102 baryons",
    "is frequently termed a diquark , and indeed it has exactly the color structure we want ; it differs from the ones we have previously discussed only by consisting solely of light quarks , and is in the `` good '' diquark combination only .    as mentioned above , one may expect the @xmath57 diquark to be slightly larger than the heavy - light diquarks , but even so , its binding to the heavy quark @xmath93 in @xmath97 and @xmath48 in @xmath100 restricts the full spatial extent of the wave function . for example , using heavy - quark symmetry and a variational approach , ref .",
    "@xcite calculate root - mean square matter radii for @xmath97 and @xmath106 to be no more than 0.22  fm and 0.31  fm , respectively . treating the @xmath100 antitriquark as",
    "a `` would - be ''",
    "@xmath106 baryon ( _ i.e. _ , differing by @xmath107 but otherwise bound by essentially the same nonperturbative physics ) , one expects @xmath100 to be not much larger than @xmath106 . in principle",
    ", the @xmath108 quark created from a gluon can mix with the one in the @xmath97 diquark .",
    "however , inasmuch as this initial @xmath57 diquark is expected to be fairly tightly bound , one expects it to propagate as an undisturbed spectator quasiparticle through the process ; otherwise , the most likely outcome would be a dissociation of the diquark , leading to a different intermediate state than described in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc ] .    in the case of the observed decay",
    "@xmath109 , the decay rate is suppressed due to the final separation of the @xmath48 quark ( in @xmath38 ) and @xmath49 quark ( in @xmath100 ) compared to the typical size of the @xmath51 wave function , and to a lesser extent due to the separation of the @xmath57 diquark @xmath85 in @xmath91 from the @xmath108 quark in @xmath38 compared to the typical size @xmath110  fm of the proton wave function .",
    "the first interesting point one notes from fig .  [",
    "fig : pc ] is the peripheral role played in the process by the @xmath111 pair created by gluodynamics .",
    "certainly , creation instead of a @xmath112 pair would give a nearly identical scenario .",
    "one therefore predicts isodoublet partners @xmath9 to be produced via @xmath113 at masses just a few mev higher ( from @xmath114 ) than those for the @xmath6 states . that the @xmath115 states should form isospin doublets",
    "is of course guaranteed by @xmath116 being a strong decay and hence conserving isospin , while @xmath117 and @xmath118 ; nevertheless , it is useful to see the charge symmetry process explicitly in the context of a particular decay mechanism .",
    "we now obtain a crude estimate of the separation of the diquark and antitriquark using the same technique as in ref .",
    "@xcite : since the two components transform as a color-@xmath119 pair , one may describe them using the well - known linear - plus - coulomb `` cornell '' nonrelativistic potential  @xcite . in the most thorough recent analysis  @xcite ,",
    "the central part of the potential for @xmath81 systems is given by @xmath120 with @xmath121 , @xmath122  gev@xmath123 , @xmath124  gev , and @xmath125  gev .",
    "the @xmath126 color factor is the same one as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : colors ] ) , and @xmath127 now refer to the components containing these quarks , in our case @xmath38 and @xmath91 , respectively .    the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite further exploited the fact that at least one of the components @xmath38 and @xmath39 is in a state of zero spin for each state of interest [ @xmath128 and @xmath22 ] , so that @xmath130 , and that both are expected to have all quarks in a relative @xmath31 wave , so that noncentral contributions to @xmath131 are not needed . in the case of the @xmath6 states , we have seen that at least one of them must have an orbital excitation , so this calculation strictly applies only to the @xmath31-wave state .",
    "furthermore , the antitriquark @xmath100 necessarily carries half - integer spin ; nevertheless , the @xmath132 term has little effect on @xmath131 except at the smallest values of @xmath133 , so we neglect it here .",
    "lastly , we use the qcd sum - rule based estimate  @xcite @xmath134  mev ( note its nearness to the @xmath135 mass 1.865  gev ) and the antitriquark mass estimate @xmath136  gev . using these assumptions , the diquark - antitriquark separations @xmath137 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cornell ] ) are @xmath138 these distances are not especially large for light hadronic systems .",
    "however , inasmuch as diquarks , and especially triquarks , containing heavy quarks may be rather smaller as discussed above , these components may be considered as well separated for the purpose of computing quantum - mechanical wave function overlaps .",
    "this separation , particularly of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 quark , explains the suppressed decay rate to @xmath51 , since the potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : cornell ] ) gives @xmath139  fm .",
    "the similarly small size for the @xmath106 also predicts slow transitions to @xmath140 , and hence overall widths that are suppressed compared to naive expectations .",
    "finally , let us consider the quantum numbers of the allowed states in this picture .",
    "orbital excitations can occur not only along the flux tube , but within the diquark and antitriquark as well .",
    "nevertheless , let us for simplicity ignore the latter . inasmuch as the diquark @xmath85 in @xmath100 inherited from the @xmath97 has spin zero , the set of allowed quantum numbers is even simpler , since then the spin of @xmath100 is @xmath141 . for @xmath31 waves ,",
    "one has the @xmath15 possibilities @xmath142 and for @xmath32 waves , one has @xmath143 where the three numbers on the left - hand side are the spin of the @xmath144 antitriquark , the orbital excitation , and the spin of the @xmath145 diquark .    in this simplified picture , we find only one state with @xmath146 , namely , the @xmath32-wave @xmath147 .",
    "it is natural to identify this state with the higher - mass @xmath3 , since it has a narrower width that can be explained by the near - threshold phase - space suppression of @xmath32 waves .",
    "then the broader @xmath2 must have @xmath148 and lie in an @xmath31 wave .",
    "note that both of these states have the @xmath145 diquark in a spin-1 configuration .",
    "it is an interesting phenomenological fact of the tetraquark sector that no @xmath149 state has yet been confirmed ; in the context of the diquark - antidiquark picture , the simplest such states would have both diquarks in @xmath150 combinations , with @xmath151 in the color flux tube as well .",
    "it is plausible that such states are much broader due to the absence of any angular momentum barriers impeding rapid decays .",
    "likewise , the lower - spin states in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : swaves ] ) and ( [ eq : pwaves ] ) might be more difficult to discern experimentally . in any case",
    ", the discovery of two new states and the possibility of numerous others left to find will certainly spur on further experimental examination .",
    "we have seen that the recently observed charmoniumlike pentaquark candidates @xmath6 may have a common dynamical origin with the charmoniumlike tetraquark states . both are proposed to occur as systems of rapidly separating color-*3 * and -@xmath58 component pairs , and in particular in the @xmath6 pentaquarks through the sequential preferential formation of color - triplet combinations @xmath152^{\\vphantom{(}}_{\\bf 3 } ( cu)_{\\bar{\\bf 3}}$ ] .",
    "the diquark @xmath145 and antitriquark @xmath144 achieve a substantial separation before hadronization must occur , providing a qualitative explanation for the suppression of the measured widths compared to available phase space .",
    "the @xmath6 states in this picture form isospin doublets with neutral , as - yet undiscovered partners .",
    "states with the observed @xmath15 quantum numbers can easily be accommodated in this scheme , and suggest the potential for discovery of numerous additional related states in the future .",
