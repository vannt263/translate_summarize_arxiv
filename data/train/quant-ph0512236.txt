    "nonclassical properties play a crucial role in understanding fundamentals of quantum physics .",
    "this concept is the main theoretical background for many applications , including quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "usually , the nonclassicality manifests itself in specific properties of quantum statistics , which sometimes can not be described in the framework of the probability theory @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was firstly considered in the famous work by einstein , podolsky , and rosen @xcite for demonstartion of contradictions between quantum mechanics and the concept of `` local realism '' .",
    "as it was shown by bell @xcite , the later leads to some inequalities violated for usual quantum mechanics .",
    "experiments of aspect with collaborators @xcite confirmed this fact as well as assumption that quantum phenomena are characterized by a specific feature , nonlocality , which can not be explained in classical terms .",
    "note that nowadays there exist some other criteria for testing the presence of this kind of nonclassicality ( entanglement ) @xcite .",
    "reconstruction of the wigner probability distribution @xcite in experiments with quantum tomography @xcite demonstrates appearance of its negative values .",
    "this peculiarity can not be explained in the framework of the probability theory , hence it does not have any classical counterparts .",
    "however , quadrature squeezing @xcite as well as sub - poissonian statistics of photon counts @xcite , being well - known examples of nonclassicality , is still possible for some states with completely positive wigner function .",
    "this is explained by the fact that these features correspond to negative values of dispersions for some normally ordered observables , which are naturally determined via the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-function @xcite .",
    "properties of this distribution differ from those for the wigner function .",
    "for example , there exist states characterized by both non - negative wigner function and non - positive glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-function .",
    "therefore , the class of states characterized by non - positive @xmath0-function includes the states characterized by non - positive wigner function , sub - poissonian statistics of photon counts and quadrature squeezing .",
    "hence , following to the works @xcite , we will consider the nonclassicality as non - positivity of the @xmath0-function . unlike the case of the wigner function",
    ", this definition can not be applied directly because of a very strong singularity of the @xmath0-function for nonclassical states .",
    "the bochner criterion @xcite allows one to formulate observable conditions for experimental testing the nonclassicality @xcite . arguing in this way",
    ", we conclude that the @xmath0-function is a positive - definite one ( or can be interpreted as probability density ) if and only if for any function @xmath1 the following inequality is satisfied : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the characteristic function of the @xmath0-distribution , _ i.e. _ its fourier transform @xmath4    hence , in order to test quantum states on the nonclassicality , it is sufficient to find such a function @xmath1 that violates the inequality ( [ 2 ] ) . an important example ( as a matter of fact it was used in @xcite ) is the discrete variant of the bochner criterion when this function is taken in the following form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are some arbitrary complex numbers . the experimental implementation of this criterion for optical fields was described in @xcite .",
    "the inequality ( [ 2 ] ) can be rewritten in another equivalent form . for this purpose",
    "we introduce the object @xmath8 , which following @xcite we will refer to as _ the witness function _ and define as following @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fourier image of @xmath1 .",
    "it is easy to see that the inequality ( [ 2 ] ) takes now the following form : @xmath11 in other words , expression ( [ 3 ] ) means that the mean value of some operator @xmath12 must be greater or equal to zero .",
    "this operator is defined in such a way that its normally ordered symbol is the witness function @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath14 where @xmath15 is coherent state . hence",
    ", if we succeed to find the operator @xmath12 satisfying ( [ woperator ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , such that its mean value is less than zero ( or condition ( [ 3 ] ) fails to obey ) , then we can assert that the nonclassicality is inherent for the given state .",
    "as it was noted in @xcite , the concept of the witness function can be used for testing other kinds of nonclassicality as well .",
    "the main problem for testing the nonclassicality for realistic systems is the decoherence @xcite .",
    "it is reasoned by uncontrolled interaction of the system with an environment that leads to substantial effects on nonclassical properties .",
    "depending on the system , the environment may have various physical nature .",
    "one of the well - known examples of such a system is an internal mode of high-@xmath16 cavity @xcite . in this case",
    ", the number of external modes plays a role of the environment , which interacts with the system through the semitransparent mirror .",
    "another example is absorption and scattering of the electromagnetic field by cavity mirrors while intracavity mode is extracted outside for the further use @xcite .",
    "absorption and scattering processes also take place while transferring a quantum electromagnetic signal through a semitransparent plate @xcite , waveguide _",
    "etc_.    the number of thermal photons in the optical domain of the electromagnetic radiation is negligibly small . hence , in this case the environment can be regarded as being in the vacuum state .",
    "the main problem is that the modern technologies in many cases do not afford to produce the optical devices with small interaction of the electromagnetic field and the absorbing medium .",
    "especially this is apparent for optical high-@xmath16 cavities , where resulting outgoing pulse includes just near 50% of the initial intracavity mode @xcite .",
    "somewhat the microwave cavities are devoid of this shortcoming .",
    "in this case , the constant of interaction between field and absorption system is comparatively small ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the microwave domain is characterized by the presence of great number of thermal photons .",
    "this causes more serious difficulties in testing nonclassical properties of quantum states .",
    "thus , there arises a natural question about a balance between the constant of interaction and temperature of environment for optimal detection of the nonclassicality .",
    "this is the subject of the presented paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ s2 ] , we obtain an equation , which describes the evolution of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-distribution of an oscillator - like system under the thermal noise influence . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , we consider how to redefine the witness function and optimize testing the nonclassicality for noisy state .",
    "application of this method with the schemes of unbalanced homodyne detection is considered in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] . in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] , we demonstrate that the discrete form of the bochner criterion does not allow a further improvement and its presented form is the best choice even for the noisy states .",
    "an example of single - photon fock number state is presented in sec .",
    "the last section contains the summary and conclusion .",
    "we will describe open quantum systems using the input - output formalism , considered in the book @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that we focus on a class of linear systems only .",
    "it gives us a possibility of considering a wide enough class of experiments with quantum electromagnetic field of low intensity .",
    "following the input - output formalism , let us consider an open quantum system as a device with two input - output ports .",
    "one of them corresponds to a system and another one corresponds to the bath ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "let the operator @xmath17 describes a system before interaction .",
    "for example , it can be an operator of the input - field mode .",
    "the operator @xmath18 describes degrees of freedom of an environment before interaction , _",
    "e.g. _ , at the initial point of time . in the same manner",
    "we will describe the system after interaction in terms of the operator @xmath19 , which can be interpreted as the output - field mode operator .",
    "we also suppose that these operators satisfy the usual bosonic commutation relations @xmath20=1,\\\\",
    "\\left[\\hat a_\\mathrm{out } , \\hat a_\\mathrm{out}^{\\dag}\\right]=1,\\\\ \\left[\\hat c_\\mathrm{in } , \\hat c_\\mathrm{in}^{\\dag}\\right]=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] without loss of generality , we can describe the evolution of the system in terms of a linear input - output relation between these operators @xmath21 where @xmath22 is efficiency of the input - output processes .",
    "let us regard some elementary examples .",
    "first of all consider transmission of a signal through a partially transparent plate ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a source of quantum electromagnetic field @xmath23 radiates the signal @xmath24 and , after transmitting through the plate , the output mode @xmath19 is detected .",
    "the bath system in this case is the electromagnetic - field modes ( @xmath25 ) , which pass in another direction .",
    "the plate plays a role of a device , which is responsible for a linear interaction between both the modes , _",
    "i.e. _ between the system and the environment .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ aout1 ] ) is the well - known input - output relation for the partially transparent plate to within a phase multiplier(see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the efficiency @xmath26 is connected with the transmission coefficient @xmath27 of the plate in the following form : @xmath28    another example is the process of quantum - state extraction from a high-@xmath16 cavity @xcite . in this case , the operator @xmath24 can be interpreted as the operator of an intracavity mode at the initial time .",
    "the operator @xmath29 corresponds to the non - monochromatic mode leaking from the cavity .",
    "the processes of absorption and scattering by mirrors can be considered as interaction between the system and the bath .",
    "hence , the operator @xmath30 corresponds to the absorption system of the mirror and scattering modes of field .",
    "corresponding input - output relation is considered in work @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this process is closely related to two components of the cavity decay rate : @xmath31 which is responsible for the output and @xmath32 which is responsible for the absorption and scattering @xmath33    as the next step we will rewrite the input - output relation ( [ aout1 ] ) in the schrdinger picture of motion , _ i.e. _ consider transformation of the density operator under the noise influence . as it was already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "it is convenient to describe the nonclassicality using the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-representation @xcite . the characteristic function ( [ 1 ] ) of the output field can be written down as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is density operator of the system and the bath .",
    "moreover , we suppose that at the initial time it can be decomposed as @xmath36    substituting the input - output relations ( [ aout1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ char1 ] ) and taking into account ( [ rho ] ) , one can obtain the following expression for the characteristic function of the output state : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the characteristic function of the input ( noiseless ) state of the system and @xmath39 is the characteristic function of the input state of the bath .",
    "we suppose that initially the bath is in the thermal state with temperature @xmath27 and the mean value of thermal photons @xmath40^{-1}$ ] , _",
    "i. e. _ , @xmath41 @xmath42 hence",
    ", the characteristic function of the output ( noisy ) state is written in the following form @xmath43 one can easily see that for @xmath44 the characteristic function ( [ a ] ) turns into a characteristic function for the positive - definite husimi - kano @xmath16-distribution @xcite of a certain state .",
    "thus , for such values of @xmath45 the @xmath0-function is always positive .",
    "one can say the same if the number of thermal photons is greater than the value determined by equation ( [ b ] ) .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ b ] ) defines _ thermal threshold of the nonclassicality_. in other words , if the number of thermal photons in the bath is greater than the value given by eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) , the nonclassicality in the sense of negative values of @xmath0-function always vanishes .",
    "however only the fact that the number of thermal photons is less than the thermal threshold defined by eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) , can not be considered as a sufficient condition of the nonclassicality .    using the inverse fourier",

    "this means that the @xmath0-function for the output state satisfies the diffusion - like differential equation @xmath48 with the `` initial '' condition @xmath49    therefore , taking into account above mentioned we can conclude that under the thermal noise influence the @xmath0-function of the system transforms according to the diffusion - like differential equation ( [ peq2 ] ) , where the mean number of the thermal photons plays the role of `` time variable '' .",
    "this means that with growing the number of thermal photons in the environment , @xmath0-function of the system is smoothed . for a certain value of @xmath50 , which is less or equal to the thermal threshold ( [ b ] ) , domains of its negative values disappear . in @xcite",
    "this critical number of thermal photons ( in our notations this is @xmath51 ) has been proposed to be used as a measure of nonclassicality .",
