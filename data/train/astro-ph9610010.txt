    "gravitational microlensing as a means of searching for dark matter objects has been proposed by paczyski in 1986 .",
    "two groups have successfully searched in the direction of the large and small magellanic clouds : the macho collaboration ( alcock et al .",
    "1993 , 1995a , 1996 ) and the eros collaboration ( aubourg et al .",
    "1993 , ansari et al .",
    "1995 ) . and",
    "clear evidence of microlensing has been observed towards the galactic center by the ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1993 , 1994 ) , macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1995b ) and duo ( alard et al .",
    "1995 , alard , mao & gilbert 1995 ) collaborations . to extend the microlensing search to other lines of sight , so that additional information be available on the properties of the lensing population , demands monitoring stars in external galaxies in regions where stars are not resolved . a field of view encompassing most of the external galaxy would also allow the exploration of the dark halo associated with the external galaxy itself . an unresolved star needs to be amplified enough by microlensing so that the increase in luminosity in a resolution element is detectable above the noise fluctuations of the background from the other unresolved stars .",
    "this is expected to occur at a rate of @xmath0 per year in the central regions of m31 for 0.08@xmath1 lenses belonging to a standard galactic dark halo ( baillon et al.1993 , ansari et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the shape of the resolution element lightcurve does not differ from that of a single lensed star but for the constant baseline being the integrated starlight in the resolution element instead of the light @xmath2 from the lensed star only .",
    "so the flux variation @xmath3 , \\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the microlensing amplification .",
    "typically , it will not be possible to measure @xmath2 , but many of the tests for microlensing of resolved stars can be applied to discriminate against light variations of other origin : non - repetition , time symmetry , achromaticity , spatial distribution . for achromaticity , one rather uses the ratio of flux variations in two colors instead of the ratio of amplifications .    in ccd observations from the ground ,",
    "light is collected not in resolution elements but in ccd pixels , and the background includes not only the constant surface brightness of the target galaxy but also the variable sky brightness , and it further varies according to atmospheric absorption . a high - precision photometric alignment of the ccd images ( better than @xmath5 ) is needed .",
    "the imperfect telescope pointing requires translation / rotation / distortion of the ccd images to superpose the same surface brightness elements on the target galaxy ( geometric alignment ) .",
    "the way agape addresses these observational challenges is described next .",
    "we took data on the 2-meter telescope tbl during 76 nights of good weather scattered over 2 months in 1994 ( sept 28nov 24 ) and 6 months in 1995 ( july  dec ) .",
    "observations were only carried out when m31 was higher than 35  above the horizon .",
    "we used two well - separated filters , johnson b and gunn r , with exposure times of 30 min and 20 min respectively .",
    "we observe at the f/25 cassegrain focus behind a focal reducer `` isard '' that brings the aperture to f/8 .",
    "the camera is a @xmath6 tektronix ccd with 24 @xmath7 m ( 0.3 arcsec ) pixels .",
    "the effective field of view covered by isard is @xmath8 pixels .",
    "we took images of 6 adjacent fields ( a  f ) in a @xmath9 pattern centered on m31 .    for various reasons , and in particular",
    "because the telescope is not dedicated , the focal reducer isard must often be dismounted and remounted .",
    "after such an operation , the positions of the mirrors and the camera are never exactly the same as before .",
    "flat - fields correct for these differences , except for those arising from an isard retuning in october 1994 for which a more sophisticated procedure was adopted ( see below ) .",
    "geometric alignment is performed by matching foreground stars on the current and reference image .",
    "( reference images are those of 1994 october 26 . ) a general linear transformation ( 6 parameters ) is fitted to the star positions , and then applied to the current image to align it with the reference . since great care was used in repointing the fields , relative rotations and distortions between images are very small .",
    "although they are important for the position of the transformed pixel , they induce negligible changes of pixel orientation , size and shape , so that pixel intensities can be obtained by bilinear interpolation , the success of this geometric alignment is seen in fig .",
    "[ geom - align ] ,    where the residuals of star positions after alignment are plotted .",
    "the dispersion is of order 0.1 arcsec , compared with a typical seeing of 12 arcsec .",
    "photometric alignment is obtained with an original method based on matching the intensity and gradient of the surface brightness of m31 across images . indeed , due to the small number of foreground stars and their poor photometry in the presence of the steep gradient , the traditional method of comparing their fluxes is not precise enough for this study . since the luminosity gradient of the bulge of m31 is much greater than the intensity fluctuations due to photon noise and seeing variations , we safely assume a linear relation between the intensities of corresponding pixels on the current and reference images .",
    "the coefficients of this intensity transformation , giving the relative absorption and the difference in sky backgrounds , are obtained from the averages and standard deviations of the pixel histograms of the two images .",
    "the efficiency of this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ photo - align ] :    .25(a ) .5(b )    histograms of pixel intensities for five images coincide after photometric alignment down to fine details .",
    "this procedure was satisfactory for photometric alignment of most images , except between those before and after the isard retuning for which preliminary application of a high - pass spatial filter ( median filter ) was required ( see ansari et al .",
    "1996 for details ) .    seeing variations induce unwanted fluctuations of the individual pixel fluxes . to reduce them",
    ", an integration over the point spread function should be performed . for the moment , we replace the intensity of each individual pixel by the sum of the pixel intensities of a @xmath10 square centered on it , which we call a super - pixel .",
    "this 2.1 arcsec wide integration zone is large enough to cope with seeing variations when the seeing is below @xmath11 arcsec .",
    "better integration methods are under study .    the time stability of each super - pixel can be quantified by the relative r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation of its intensity around its time average .",
    "the map in fig .",
    "[ rms - spix ]    shows this relative dispersion for super - pixels of field a. dark spots correspond to foreground stars and should be disregarded .",
    "the fluctuation is typically of 0.3% and can be as low as 0.1% in the most stable regions ( next to the m31 center ) . to compare it to the photon counting noise ,",
    "we have computed the @xmath12 distribution of each super - pixel lightcurve using errors proportional to the poissonian photon noise , and have found that a constant of proportionality equal to 1.7 makes the maxima of the computed and poissonian distributions coincide ( fig .",
    "[ chi2 ] ) .    the observed distribution shows",
    "however non - poissonian tails , probably related to seeing variations .",
    "globally , we can say that geometric alignment of images is not a serious problem , and that our photometric alignment produces lightcurves of quiet super - pixels that are stable to around twice the photon noise .",
    "we are now in a position to select variable super - pixel lightcurves , and to discriminate those corresponding to microlensing from those due to variable sources .",
    "the outcome of the previous data reduction are super - pixel lightcurves .",
    "we present here examples of such lightcurves in the gunn r filter , as illustration of the possibilities of our method .",
    "the vertical axis is in adu / s ( 1 adu / s in gunn r corresponds to a surface brightness @xmath13 ) .",
    "the error bars are set at 1.7 times the photon counting noise , where the factor 1.7 arises as argued above .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation of this lightcurve is 0.045 adu / s , smaller than the average of the error bars ( 0.065 adu / s ) .",
    "note that this corresponds to 0.002 mag .",
    "super - pixels are indeed very stable and error bars at 1.7 the photon noise are realistic .",
    "this is true for most super - pixels in our fields .",
    "hundreds of variable objects like the preceding one have been detected , and we are only beginning to analyse their nature .",
    "we have a host of cepheid candidates and five novae , with peak magnitude and rate of decrease similar to the m31 novae quoted in hodge 1992 .",
    "we also see variations compatible with microlensing events , but at this stage we are not in a position to claim that they indeed are microlensing events .",
    "this because ( i ) our coverage in time is too short to be sure that the variations do not repeat or that some of the events are really symmetric , and ( ii ) we have not yet analysed the blue lightcurves and so can not test achromaticity . fig .",
    "[ micro ]    shows one of the lightcurves that resemble microlensing events .",
    "the paczyski curve corresponds to a star of absolute magnitude @xmath14 amplified by a factor of 6 at maximum and to an einstein time scale @xmath15 days .",
    "because of a degeneracy for high amplification events ( see e.g. gould 1995 ) , a time scale and maximum amplification twice as large associated with a star twice fainter would fit just as well .",
    "however the time scale can not be much shorter than 65 days , because the star should have been brighter and would have been seen before being lensed .",
    "our simulations for galactic lenses of mass 0.08@xmath1 ( 100% of standard halo ) predict that at our level of stability we should detect @xmath0 microlensing events in our data , an event being detectable if its lightcurve remains 3@xmath16 above the background in at least 3 consecutive images and reaches 5@xmath16 in at least one of them .",
    "we have shown here that such variations are clearly detectable from their time coherence , but more work is still needed to discriminate microlensing events from other kinds of variations .",
