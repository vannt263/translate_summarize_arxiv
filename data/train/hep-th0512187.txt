    ", the current may mix with operators of equal or lower dimension whose four - divergence vanishes identically , i.e. , without use of the equations of motion . as observed in @xcite there are no such operators in the absence of gauge fields , and so the nonrenormalization theorem holds in nongauge theories .",
    "the theorem also extends to pure qcd for the flavor currents , where the available operators all have nonzero color .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     however in qed ( and therefore in the full standard model ) , the current does mix with the four - divergence of the electromagnetic field - strength tensor , @xmath0 .",
    "the mixing is associated with `` penguin graph '' contributions to matrix elements , fig.[fig : penguin.general](b ) .",
    "the conventional proof @xcite of nonrenormalization ignores such graphs .",
    "similar statements apply in more general theories .    in this article",
    ", we explain the necessary modifications , to all orders of perturbation theory , for the electron number current in qed with a single lepton flavor .",
    "( the results generalize readily to multiple lepton flavors . )",
    "there is a series of inter - related results :    * the current needs ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalization , by the addition of a counterterm proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the coefficient can be set in terms of the coupling and the @xmath1 coefficient in the lagrangian . *",
    "the renormalization is by addition of an operator that does not affect the ward identities .",
    "nevertheless , after the application of equations of motion to the renormalized current operator in physical matrix elements , the renormalization is effectively multiplicative . *",
    "if -renormalization is used , the current has a nonzero anomalous dimension .",
    "* renormalization also affects the normalization of the charge operator for electron number , unless the photon has a nonzero mass .",
    "the main part of this result was first found by luri ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , eq .  ( ( 8(35 ) ) ) .",
    "* there is a unique finite correction to the counterterm s coefficient that both removes the anomalous dimension and produces a correct electron number operator that is the integral of an electron number density . in effect",
    "we have to subtract contributions associated with vacuum polarization .",
    "* thus the noether current for electron number is not the correct operator to define electron number .",
    "a notable illustration is in multi - flavor qed , where , for example , the total muon number of a one - electron state is nonzero , as computed from the standard noether current . *",
    "the counterterm restores the gauss s law relation between total charge and the flux of the electric field at infinity . *",
    "although the effect on the total number operator , as opposed to the local current , only occurs when the photon mass is exactly zero , it depends neither on infrared ( ir ) divergences as such nor on uv divergences .",
    "it occurs even in a space - time dimension greater than 4 , where there are no soft divergences in the scattering matrix , and with a spatial - lattice cutoff , which removes all uv problems . *",
    "a simple standard argument involving equal - time canonical anticommutators , appears to show that the electron number of states is not renormalized , contrary to reality .",
    "we resolve this paradox , which was first found by weeks @xcite ( see appendix ) .",
    "the possibility that problems exist can be motivated by the standard proof that the electron - number operator is time - independent : @xmath2 where the surface term is usually dropped .",

    "fig : penguin.general](c )    although our results are quite elementary , and should be well - known , the only textbook account we have found is by luri @xcite . since current operators are auxiliary operators used to analyze a theory , the nontrivial renormalization of the current does not have direct effects on the scattering matrix and cross sections .",
    "weeks s paradox does symptomize some deep complications in the correct definition of states in a gauge theory .",
    "however , many practical calculations use the operator product expansion and factorization methods",
    ". then matrix elements of currents and related operators are used , so that incorrect theoretical expectations for anomalous dimensions will affect predictions .",
    "beneke and neubert @xcite indeed found closely related effects in their analysis of @xmath5 decays , and remarked ( without further comment ) that quark number currents have nonzero anomalous dimensions in the presence of electromagnetic interactions .",
    "we use the standard gauge - fixed lagrangian density @xmath6 our conventions are that a superscript @xmath7 ( or subscript in @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) denotes bare quantities , dimensional regularization is in @xmath10 dimensions , and the @xmath11-matrices in @xmath12-dimensions are normalized to obey @xmath13 .",
    "note that the bare and renormalized couplings obey @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the usual unit of mass , and that the gauge fixing term has no counterterm .",

    "finiteness of the right - hand side might lead one to conclude incorrectly that green functions ( and hence matrix elements ) of @xmath20 are finite , so that the current is not renormalized .",

    "if the equations of motion were needed to prove the vanishing of the four - divergence of a counterterm , extra divergent terms would appear on the right - hand side of the ward identity .    in qed",

    "however this is not the case in matrix elements .",

    "this naturally matches with the classical limit of electromagnetism , for macroscopic phenomena .",
    "we have defined a physical charge and current , but the necessity of nontrivial renormalization depends on whether the photon is massless or not and on whether the current or charge is considered :    * in the @xmath71 dimensional theory , the noether current always needs uv renormalization , independently of @xmath72 . * the counterterm never affects the ward identities .",

    "* * a particular finite part in the counterterm is needed to obtain the correct charge . * * even when the theory is regulated in the uv , the finite renormalization of the current and charge are still needed , if the the charge is to be correct .",
    "* however , even with a nonzero photon mass , the definition of the physical current ( [ eq : phys.current.def ] ) is valid and gives the correct charge .",
    "( the counterterm integrates to zero . )",
    "this definition has the practical advantages that there are no problems in taking the limits of zero photon mass , integration over all space , and removing a uv regulator , and that changing the order of limits is safe .",
    "evidently the need for a nontrivial renormalization of the total electron number ( as opposed to the current ) only arises when the photon is massless .",
    "however , it is to be emphasized that this is not due to actual infra - red divergences as normally understood .",
    "this can be seen by considering the theory in 5 space - time dimensions ( i.e. , 4 space dimensions ) , with a spatial lattice .",
    "the higher space - time dimension is sufficient to remove all the usual soft divergences in the scattering matrix .",
    "the use of an integer dimension removes all possible artifacts associated with dimensional regularization , and the use of a spatial lattice gives us a conventional quantum mechanical theory ( in real time ) without uv divergences .",
    "all the considerations leading to a physical current that is not equal to the noether current still apply .",
    "it is sometimes claimed that the actual definition of qed requires us first to regulate the theory in the ir , say with a nonzero photon mass , and then to take the limit of zero photon mass .",
    "if this were so , we could avoid the need to redefine the charge , since in the regulated theory the noether charge would give the correct answer .",
    "however , as a field theory , qed exists if the photon mass is kept at zero at all stages ; this is evidenced by the fact that the green functions of the theory exist directly at @xmath73 .",
    "the use of an ir regulator ( and inclusive cross sections that allow undetected soft photon emission ) is only necessary if one uses the conventional lsz formalism to compute cross sections . in any case , when the space - time dimension is above 4 there are no soft photon divergences in cross sections , but nevertheless a redefinition of the charge is still needed , as we have just seen .",
    "our arguments generalize to more complicated theories .",
    "for example , the approach applies to qed with more than one flavor of lepton , with suitable changes in the numbers of flavors in the vacuum polarization graphs .",
    "the approach applies not only to the electromagnetic current itself , but also to the individual conserved flavor - number currents .",
    "we propose an interpretation of the nontrivial renormalization of the current as a universal effect of attempts to measure the current .",
    "the quantum mechanical current creates polarization of the vacuum .",
    "although this effect is proportional to @xmath74 at a distance @xmath75 from a source , it has to be integrated over a sphere of surface area proportional to @xmath76 , so that the effect is nonvanishing as @xmath77 .",

    "we thank s. adler , m. neubert , j. rabin , m. srednicki , and m. voloshin for comments on the first version of this paper .",
    "conventional expectations for the interpretation of a charge operator , and , in particular , for its value in a state of definite electron number arise quite generally from the commutation relations between the noether current and bare elementary fields .",
    "these commutation relations are entirely unaffected by uv renormalization and are fundamental to the definition of a quantum field theory .",
    "inspired by the paper of weeks @xcite , we now present a paradox .    the paradox and its resolution turn on the issue of the correct way to implement concretely the concept of the electron number of a state .",
    "there are several possible ways of implementing the concept . in scattering theory",
    ", we can use in- or out - states as basis states ; the labeling of these states in the usual way gives unambiguous values for electron number .",

    "the different definitions can be proved to agree .",
    "but , as we will see , in qed an attempt to make such a proof runs into problems .",
    "the problems are related to , but distinct from , the issues treated in the body of this paper .      1 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the ( true ) vacuum state and let @xmath79 be any state of electron number unity . while we may use an on - shell one - electron state of definite momentum for @xmath79 , it is safer to use a normalizable wave - packet state .",

    "however , matrix elements of a field operator with this part of the state have a divergence in the same limit . moreover this anomalous contribution is associated with unphysical parts of the theory : the unphysical states in feynman gauge , or the instantaneous coulomb potential in coulomb gauge .",

    "we may therefore anticipate that contributions from unphysical intermediate states in eq.([eq : comm.me ] ) are essential to get the correct result .",
    "this can be seen explicitly from the graphs of fig.[fig : bjl.photon.cut ] , where the cuts correspond to the cases that @xmath106 is an out - state of one electron and one photon , and that @xmath107 is a state of one photon .",
    "the vacuum polarization factor is @xmath108 given that the photon is on - shell , @xmath4 .",
    "this means that in the first graph , the sole contribution is from a photon with a scalar polarization , i.e. , a polarization vector proportional to its lightlike momentum .",
    "this is a state of zero norm : the current applied to the vacuum has not created a genuine photon .",
    "moreover , in the relevant part of ( [ eq : comm.me ] ) , the vacuum polarization factor ( [ eq : vac.pol ] ) vanishes quadratically when @xmath109 , which is completely compatible with the natural expectation that the vacuum has zero charge , so that it is annihilated by the operator @xmath81 .",
    "the nonzero result at @xmath115 is independent of the space - time dimension .",
    "thus it does not depend on the existence of ir divergences that violate the standard principles for asymptotic scattering states , but only on the masslessness of the photon .    to summarize : although the charge operator applied to the vacuum , for example , does give zero , this is compensated by an infinity in the matrix element with the field operator .",
    "moreover the offending intermediate state is of zero norm , before taking the @xmath109 limit , so the state is equivalent to the zero state .",
    "similar remarks apply to the one - electron - one - photon intermediate state from the other diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : bjl.photon.cut ] .",
    "a related issue is about the value of the commutator of the physical charge . in physical matrix elements ,",
    "the two charges differ by a factor @xmath82 , and it is tempting to say that the commutators also differ by this factor . but consider the expression of the physical current in terms of the noether current and @xmath116 .",
    "this is obtained by application of the equations of motion eq .",
    "( [ eq : e.of.m.ren ] ) to the physical current eq .",
    "( [ eq : phys.current.def ] ) , but without the physical state condition that we used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phys.current.physme ] ) : @xmath117 the physical electron number operator is defined as an integral over @xmath118 , so that @xmath119 in physical matrix elements we can ignore the second term , to get the usual ratio of @xmath82 between the physical and noether charges .",
    "but in commutators with elementary fields , we must include the second term . since this second term involves a _",
    "double _ time - derivative of the gauge field , the equations of motion must be applied to write it in terms of elementary fields and their canonical momenta , if we are to use canonical commutation and anticommutation relations .",
    "this gives extra terms , so the commutators of @xmath120 and @xmath81 with elementary fields are not simply related by @xmath82 .",
    "the appropriate formula to use is , in fact , either of the two last lines of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phys.current.def ] ) . for the @xmath102 component",
    "we have @xmath121 \\int { \\rm d}^3{\\mathbf{x } }      \\frac {   \\partial_\\nu f^{(0 ) \\ , \\nu 0 } }                   { e_0 } \\nn                   & = & q_{\\rm n }                   - \\frac{1-\\hat{z}_3^{-1}}{e_0 }       \\int { \\rm d}^3{\\mathbf{x } } \\left [   { \\mathbf{\\nabla}}^2 a^0         + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } { \\mathbf{\\nabla}}\\cdot{\\mathbf{a}}^{(0)}\\right ] , \\nn       \\label{eq : div.e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , the noether charge density , with unit normalization , plus a term that involves at most a first - order time derivative , so that it commutes at equal time with the fermion fields , to give @xmath122=\\left[q_{\\rm n},\\bar \\psi\\right]=\\bar\\psi$ ] .",
    "thus , despite the relative factor @xmath82 between the physical and noether charges as projected onto physical states , the commutators with the fermion do not have this factor .      in the coulomb gauge version of the bjl calculation from the graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : bjl.penguin ] , the vacuum polarization graph times the photon propagator is now @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the unit vector defining the rest frame for the coulomb gauge , and we have dropped those terms in the propagator that are exactly zero because the vacuum polarization is transverse . it is easily checked that this formula equals @xmath125 . as @xmath126 , this is missing the power suppression that we have in covariant gauge .",
    "if the theory is regulated in the uv , e.g. , by using @xmath127 , then the vacuum polarization does go to zero , so that the loop correction to the standard commutator vanishes .",
    "but after the regulator is removed , the vacuum polarization grows logarithmically .",
    "evidently there is an anomaly in the commutator of the noether charge density with the field @xmath96 . because constrained quantization is used , it is not automatically true that standard canonical commutation and anticommutation relations can be maintained .",
    "but this result depends on the space - time dimension .",
    "interesting dimension - independent pathologies also arise in the calculation of the commutator with intermediate states , but from electron - positron terms instead of photon terms . in the photon term",
    ", we have the same vacuum polarization factor eq .",
    "( [ eq : vac.pol ] ) as before , but now @xmath94 times the numerator on the on - shell photon line gives exactly zero .",
    "instead there are extra contributions from intermediate states with electron - positron pairs , fig .",
    "[ fig : bjl.epem.cut ] .",
    "the cut vacuum polarization graph has the transverse form @xmath128 where @xmath129 is no longer zero , but is bounded below by @xmath130 .",
    "the spatial part of this vector gives zero when multiplied into the photon propagator .",
    "however , the time component multiplies a factor @xmath131 for the instantaneous coulomb potential , so that we get a nonzero limit at @xmath115 . of course , the energy @xmath100 is nonzero , but this is allowed , since the charge operator is computed from the charge density at a fixed time , so that in momentum space there is an integral over all @xmath100 .",
    "the result of a nonzero limit at @xmath115 is dimension independent , and again indicates that states of definite particle number are not actual eigenstates of the noether charge .",
    "but the source of the anomaly has changed . in feynman",
    "gauge the anomalous contribution was associated with unphysical states .",
    "but in coulomb gauge , it is associated with the unphysically instantaneous potential in the photon propagator ."
