    "there are two general paradigms for implementing quantum algorithms  @xcite . in the first , the quantum algorithm",
    "is implemented on a single quantum system with the appropriate number of qubits and which can be prepared in a suitable pure state and is amenable to projective measurements .",
    "most quantum algorithms are written with this in mind . in the second paradigm",
    ", the algorithm is implemented on an ensemble of of identical , non - interacting quantum computers .",
    "this is the situation with conventional room temperature , solution state nmr implementations , in which case the ensemble consists of approximately @xmath1 molecules  @xcite .    in ensemble implementations each ensemble member undergoes the same unitary evolution as its companions and algorithms for the two paradigms are typically most similar in this respect .",
    "however , they differ in the initialization and measurement stages . in general",
    "an ensemble quantum computer can only be prepared in a mixed state , so that the state of any single ensemble member is not known with certainty .",
    "also , the output from an ensemble quantum computer is an average of individual ensemble member measurement outcomes .",
    "the initialization and measurement issues have led to modifications of quantum algorithms for ensemble realizations .",
    "the conventional approach to ensemble quantum computing initializes the ensemble in a pseudo - pure state , for which various preparation techniques have been proposed  @xcite and which has the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of qubits , @xmath4 is a known pure state and @xmath5 is called the _ polarization . _ the idea is that under the collection of unitaries required to implement a quantum algorithm , @xmath6 , the density operator transforms to @xmath7 where @xmath8 and this is followed by measuring the expectation value of a traceless observable .",
    "the identity component of of @xmath9 does not contribute to this measurement outcome and it is as though the pure state algorithm represented by @xmath10 has been implemented .",
    "much of the discussion of ensemble quantum computing on pseudo - pure states has focused on the scaling properties of the polarization with respect to the problem s input size  @xcite or the presence of entanglement in these  @xcite . in particular",
    ", most pseudo - pure state preparation schemes result in polarizations which diminish exponentially as the number of qubits increases , thus resulting in exponentially decreasing output signal strength .",
    "however , a promising new approach using nmr with parahydrogen induced polarization attains high polarizations and appears to avoid these problems  @xcite .    here",
    "we consider how well an ensemble quantum algorithm , for a given polarization and ensemble size , performs in relation to competing classical probabilistic algorithms .",
    "we propose a criterion , considering the ensemble size as one of the resources , for which an ensemble algorithm can be compared fairly to a classical competitor .",
    "we then use this to ask , for a certain class of problems , whether there is a critical polarization below which the quantum algorithm fails with greater probability than the classical algorithm .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : general ]",
    "we provide a general scheme for comparing the performance of ensemble quantum algorithms to their classical counterparts .",
    "we only consider algorithms for which the output is obtained after measuring a _ single qubit . _ in section  [ sec : dj ] we apply the general scheme to the deutsch - jozsa algorithm determine the critical polarization below which the quantum algorithm fails with greater probability than a classical random algorithm .",
    "finally , the appendices contain much of the mathematical derivations of various essential results .",
    "we consider problems which take one of many possible inputs and determine into which of _ two possible classes _ the input falls . any classical algorithm to solve one of these",
    "could be designed to write the output to one bit ; those inputs returning `` 0 '' fall into `` class 0 '' , and those returning `` 1 '' fall into `` case 1 . ''",
    "we assume that a quantum algorithm exists , which , when applied to a collection of qubits in an appropriate pure initial state , can determine the input class with certainty . it is convenient to split the collection of qubits into a single qubit target register , on which a measurement will reveal the input type , and a remaining @xmath3-qubit argument and workspace register as may be required by the algorithm .",
    "this quantum analog proceeds as : @xmath11 where the subscripts denote the argument / workspace and target registers and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are normalized but not necessarily orthogonal argument register states .",
    "the input class is revealed following a computational basis measurement on the target qubit .    on an ensemble",
    "quantum computer initially in the pseudo - pure state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pseudopure ] ) , the typical protocol  @xcite for determining the input class is based on the expectation value for the target qubit , @xmath14 this evidently allows one to distinguish the input class by `` measuring an expectation value '' ( provided that the polarization is suitably large for detection in a particular experimental setup ) and checking whether it is @xmath15 or @xmath16 however , for an ensemble with a finite number of members @xmath17 and whose final state is mixed as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalstate ] ) , the random nature of the target qubit measurement outcomes on individual ensemble members generates statistical fluctuations which will yield outcomes that are almost never precisely @xmath18 .",
    "it is then essential to elaborate the protocol for deciding the input class , determine the probability with which this gives a correct result and compare this to a classical probabilistic algorithm which uses the same resources .    the protocol which we advocate replaces @xmath19 by a suitable sample average of computational basis measurement outcomes over all the ensemble members .",
    "we assume that a computational basis measurement is performed on each ensemble member and that each measurement outcome is scaled to be compatible with the eigenvalues of @xmath20 , i.e.  let @xmath21 , @xmath22 correspond to the outcome of the measurements associated with projectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "these yield a sample average @xmath25 which typically approximates @xmath19 well as @xmath26 this leads to the decision protocol : @xmath27 this amounts a majority vote on the number of individual ensemble member outcomes which are @xmath21 or @xmath22 or a completely unbiased guess whenever the numbers of the two outcomes are identical .",
    "let @xmath28 be the number of times that that @xmath29 and @xmath30 the number of times that @xmath31 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the excess of positive measurement outcomes .",
    "the protocol of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sampprotocol ] ) assumes the best possible resolution in the measuring apparatus .",
    "that is , one can distinguish between @xmath34 ( for @xmath17 odd ) or @xmath35 or @xmath36 ( for @xmath17 even ) .",
    "we refer to this as the _ best resolution case .",
    "_ we shall later generalize this to arbitrary measurement resolution and demonstrate that the best resolution case is optimal .",
    "the probability with which the quantum algorithm misidentifies the input type can be determined by considering the various routes to failure .",
    "the probability that that a `` class 0 '' input will be misidentified as `` class 1 '' will be denoted as @xmath37 and the probability that a `` class 1 '' input will be misidentified as `` class 0 '' as @xmath38 .",
    "assuming that an input is chosen from `` class 0 '' with the same probability as from `` class 1 , '' the quantum failure probability is @xmath39 now suppose that the algorithm is run with a `` class 0 '' input .",
    "the input will be misidentified if @xmath40 or if an incorrect class is guessed when @xmath41 the probabilities with which these occur can be derived from those for measurement outcomes on individual ensemble members . in this case",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pseudopurefinal ] ) and  ( [ eq : finalstate ] ) that @xmath42 similarly if the algorithm is run with a `` class 1 '' input the failure probability can be determined by switching @xmath28 with @xmath30 in the conditions for misidentification and @xmath29 with @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : individualprobs ] ) .",
    "the symmetry in these situations implies that @xmath43 and thus @xmath44 since measurements on each ensemble member amount to a bernoulli trial the `` class 0 '' failure probability is a cumulative binomial distribution .",
    "the precise form of this depends on whether @xmath17 is even or odd . for odd @xmath17 , the case @xmath45 can not occur and @xmath46 indicating the dependence of the failure probability on polarization and ensemble size . for even m , the case @xmath45 can occur and @xmath47",
    "the best resolution case assumes that the measurement apparatus allows one to distinguish between two circumstances where the values of @xmath48 differ by as little as @xmath36 and thus values of @xmath49 which differ by as little as @xmath50 in a _ general resolution case _ we assume that one can only distinguish between two situations where the values of @xmath48 differ by a _ resolution _ of at least @xmath51 which could depend on @xmath52 in the context of the protocol of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sampprotocol ] ) this means that outcomes for which @xmath53 can be regarded as pure noise .",
    "the maximum magnitude of the sample average associated with this noise is @xmath54 and noting that the maximum sample average associated with any outcome has magnitude @xmath55 , the signal to noise ratio is represented by @xmath56 this can be used as a guide to precise behavior of the resolution as a function of ensemble size , which may depend on the details of the apparatus .",
    "regardless of these details , the decision protocol for the general resolution case is : @xmath57 note that the best resolution case is represented by @xmath58 the symmetry in this protocol again results in @xmath59 the `` class 0 '' input failure probabilities are more conveniently expressed in terms of @xmath60 to do so , note that unequivocal failure , i.e.  @xmath61 corresponds to @xmath62 and , since @xmath63 this is equivalent to @xmath64 for convenience define the minimum number of occurrences of @xmath65 needed for unequivocal failure as @xmath66 clearly @xmath67 also , it is easily shown that the ambiguous outcome @xmath68 is equivalent to @xmath69 thus the quantum algorithm fails with probability    @xmath70    several important properties of this general quantum failure probability are proved in appendix  [ app : qfp ] .",
    "first , for fixed @xmath17 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath73 and @xmath74 the former corresponds to a maximally mixed initial state , for which the algorithm produces a maximally mixed final state and any decisions about input classes amount to unbiased guesses .",
    "the latter case corresponds to a pure initial state , for which the algorithm never fails .",
    "second , for fixed @xmath73 and @xmath17 , as the resolution decreases , i.e.  @xmath71 increases , @xmath72 increases .",
    "thus the best resolution case provides a lower bound on the failure probability for the quantum algorithm , as is to be expected .",
    "this bounding property is important since it appears to be easier to arrive at certain results for the best resolution case than the general resolution case .",
    "two important results regarding the best resolution case are also proved in appendix  [ app : qfp ] .",
    "first , if @xmath17 is odd then the best resolution case failure probabilities for @xmath17 and @xmath75 are equal .",
    "second , if @xmath17 is odd then the best resolution failure probability for @xmath76 is strictly less than that for @xmath17 unless @xmath77 or @xmath78 ( both statements require fixed @xmath73 ) .",
    "thus , in the best resolution case at least , it is advantageous to using ensembles of increasing size .    in general",
    "there are no closed form expressions for cumulative binomial distributions of the sort encountered in eqs  ( [ eq : pfailodd ] ) ,  ( [ eq : pfaileven ] ) and  ( [ eq : pfailqgen ] ) .",
    "however , the following result due to bahadur  @xcite can give good approximations , particularly for @xmath26 if @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath3 are positive integers , and @xmath81 then , provided that @xmath82 @xmath83\\leqslant b_n(m)\\leqslant a_n(m )   \\label{eq : bahadur1}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 consider first the best resolution case , in which case it is only necessary to consider situations where @xmath17 is odd .",

    "in such cases the quantum error probability is well approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bahadur2 ] ) after the correct substitutions for @xmath89 and @xmath90 now consider the general resolution case .",

    "( [ eq : bahadur2 ] ) twice with appropriate @xmath89 and @xmath90    it remains to compare the failure probability for a quantum algorithm to that for competing classical probabilistic algorithms .",

    "we are concerned with cases where @xmath17 is very large since these are typical in nmr realizations and also the quantum failure probability in the best resolution case decreases as @xmath17 increases .",
    "however , the ensemble size must be included in the count of resources and we do so by incorporating this into the total number of oracle queries ( this has been used in the context of ensemble realizations of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm on thermal equilibrium - type states@xcite ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 invokes the oracle @xmath101 times .",
    "since @xmath6 is applied to each ensemble member , the aggregate number of oracle queries is @xmath102 thus a quantum algorithm using @xmath101 queries per quantum computer operating on an ensemble with @xmath17 members must be compared to a classical probabilistic algorithm which uses @xmath103 oracle queries . denote the classical failure probability with @xmath103 oracle queries by @xmath104 it is assumed that @xmath105 and that @xmath106 decreases as @xmath103 increases .",
