    "the concept of _ spontaneous synchronization _ is ubiquitous in nature .",
    "single oscillators in a population ( like flashing fireflies , chirping crickets or spiking brain cells ) may rotate incoherently , at their own natural frequency , when they are isolated from the population , but within the population they adapt their rhythm to that of the other oscillators , acting as a system of coupled oscillators .",
    "there is no central driving mechanism , yet the population reaches a globally synchronized state via mutual local interactions .",
    "the omnipresence of spontaneous synchronization triggered scientists to search for a mathematical approach in order to understand the underlying principles .",
    "the first steps were taken by winfree  @xcite , @xcite , who recognized that spontaneous synchronization should be understood as a threshold phenomenon : if the coupling between the oscillators is sufficiently strong , then a macroscopic part of the population freezes into synchrony . although the model that winfree proposed was too difficult to solve analytically , it inspired kuramoto  @xcite , @xcite to suggest a more mathematically tractable model that captures the same phenomenon .",
    "the kuramoto model has since been used successfully to study synchronization in a variety of different contexts . by",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , the kuramoto model still poses many challenges .",
    "as long as the interaction is _ mean - field _",
    "( meaning that every oscillator interacts equally strongly with every other oscillator ) , a fairly complete theory has been developed .",
    "however , as soon as the interaction has a _ non - trivial geometry _ , computations become cumbersome .",
    "there is a large literature for the kuramoto model on complex networks , where the population is viewed as a random graph whose vertices carry the oscillators and whose edges represent the interaction .",
    "numerical and heuristic results have been obtained for networks with a small - world , scale - free and/or community structure , showing a range of interesting phenomena ( for a review , see arenas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in the present paper we focus on one particular network with a community structure ,",
    "namely , the _ hierarchical lattice_.    the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "sections  [ sec : mfk][sec : scaling ] are devoted to the mean - field noisy kuramoto model . in section  [ sec : mfk ] we recall definitions and basic properties . in section  [ sec : mv ] we recall the mckean - vlasov equation , which describes the evolution of the probability density for the phase oscillators and their natural frequencies in the _ mean - field limit_. in section  [ sec : scaling ] we take a closer look at the scaling properties of the order parameters towards the mean - field limit . in section  [ sec : hl ] we define the hierarchical lattice and in section  [ sec : hkm ] introduce the noisy kuramoto model on the hierarchical lattice , which involves a sequence of interaction strengths @xmath0 and a sequence of disorder distributions @xmath1 acting on successive hierarchical levels .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] contains our main results , presented in the form of three theorems for the non - disordered system and their analogues for the disordered system .",
    "these theorems are valid in the _ hierarchical mean - field limit _ and show that , for each @xmath2 , the block communities at hierarchical level @xmath3 behave like the mean - field noisy kuramoto model , with an interaction strength and a noise that depend on @xmath3 and are obtained via a _ renormalization transformation _ connecting successive hierarchical levels .",
    "there are three universality classes for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , corresponding to loss of synchronization at a finite hierarchical level , loss of synchronization as the hierarchical level tends to infinity , and no loss of synchronization .",
    "the renormalization transformation allows us to describe these classes in some detail . in section  [ sec : thmscalphase ] we prove the renormalization scheme , in section  [ sec : thmclasses ] we prove the criteria for the universality classes _ subject to a technical inequality that is verified numerically for three different types of disorder_. appendix  [ app : proofs ] contains the proof of certain inequalities linking the system with disorder to the system without disorder .",
