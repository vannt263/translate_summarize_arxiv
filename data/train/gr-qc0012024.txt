    "perhaps the simplest example in electrodynamics of an impulsive electromagnetic wave is produced when a charge @xmath0 receives an impulsive acceleration or deceleration .",
    "for example the charge @xmath0 might be moving rectilinearly with constant 3velocity @xmath1 relative to the laboratory frame and is suddenly halted .",
    "this means that in minkowskian space ",
    "time there is a sudden change in the direction of the 4velocity of the charge . as a result",
    "a spherical impulsive electromagnetic wave is emitted .",
    "although this physical situation has been known for some time @xcite no analytical description appears to have ever been given allowing calculations ( such as those given in section 4 here ) with the explicit maxwell field of the charge .",
    "the construction of this maxwell field is one of the objectives of the present paper .",
    "it involves subdividing minkowskian space ",
    "time into two halves , each having as boundary the future null cone history @xmath2 of the impulsive electromagnetic wave , and then glueing the halves back together whilst maintaining via _ matching conditions _ the invariance of a certain quantity .",
    "this construction is carried out in section 2 and a coordinate system is obtained in which the metric tensor of the re  attached space ",
    "times is continuous across the future null ",
    "cone @xmath2 .",
    "this enables us to see clearly that ( i ) the glueing ensures that the space ",
    "time remains flat on @xmath2 and thus @xmath2 can not , for example , be the history of a gravitational impulsive wave or shock wave and ( ii ) the electromagnetic field we construct satisfies maxwell s vacuum field equations everywhere off the world ",
    "line of the charge @xmath0 and , in particular on the future null ",
    "cone @xmath2 minus its vertex .",
    "we then define a measure of the intensity of the electromagnetic impulse wave and show that its dependence on the original 3velocity @xmath1 of the charge is typical of the velocity dependence of the intensity of electromagnetic bremsstrahlung emitted in beta decay @xcite .",
    "we thus refer to the impulsive electromagnetic wave as instantaneous electromagnetic bremsstrahlung .",
    "having described instantaneous bremsstrahlung in electromagnetism one is naturally lead to ask similar questions in the case of the gravitational interaction : what happens when a mass receives an impulsive acceleration or deceleration ?",
    "in particular will an impulsive gravitational wave accompany the abrupt change in motion of the mass ?",
    "our geometrical approach to the electromagnetic case is perfectly adapted to this new situation . in section 3",
    "we glue together two schwarzschild space  times having as common boundary a future null  cone @xmath2 , using the same _ matching conditions _ as in the electromagnetic case .",
    "also one of the schwarzschild space ",
    "times involves a parameter @xmath1 which we show allows us to interpret its source as moving rectilinearly with 3velocity @xmath1 , compared to the source of the second schwarzschild space  time , as measured by an observer at spatial infinity .",
    "thus a distant observer sees a uniformly moving source come to a sudden halt . as a result",
    "a signal travels outward with history @xmath2 .",
    "we use the theory of light  like signals in general relativity developed by barrabs ",
    "israel @xcite to show that this signal is a light  like shell ( burst of neutrinos , for example ) .",
    "this emission of a light  like",
    "shell is similar to a rocket exhaust which carries sufficient energy to result in zero recoil velocity .",
    "we point out , following ( 3.20 ) below , the sense in which our model may be thought of as a limiting case of a kinnersley rocket .",
    "thus there is no gravitational radiation ( i.e. it is not a spherical impulsive gravitational wave ) .",
    "furthermore we demonstrate that the relative kinetic energy of the source , when travelling with 3velocity @xmath1 measured by a distant observer , is converted into the energy of the light ",
    "like shell when the source suddenly stops .",
    "the physical interpretation of our model and the global structure of spacetime will be discussed .    in section 4 below we illustrate some calculations that can be carried out with the electromagnetic field obtained in section 2 .",
    "these are based on the observations of penrose @xcite that after a charge @xmath0 receives an impulsive acceleration the resulting spherical impulsive electromagnetic wave ( a ) approximates a plane impulsive electromagnetic wave in the far zone and ( b ) if it then experiences a head  on collision with a plane impulsive gravitational wave , the electromagnetic wave will back  scatter . this sort of phenomenon can be expected because pure unidirectional electromagnetic radiation must have a propagation direction in space ",
    "time which is shear  free ( and geodesic ) @xcite .",
    "however when the shear  free null geodesics intersect the history of a plane impulsive gravitational wave they must acquire shear @xcite .",
    "hence the resulting electromagnetic field can not be a pure unidirectional radiation field but must have another part to it ( the back scattered radiation field ) . in section 4",
    "the plane wave limit of the electromagnetic wave of section 2 is obtained and its subsequent head  on collision with a plane impulsive gravitational wave is considered . the electromagnetic field in the region between the waves after collision is derived by solving maxwell s vacuum field equations with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "it is explicitly seen that the impulsive wave looses its plane character and the back  scattered radiation appears .",
    "in addition the electromagnetic field in this region after the collision becomes singular where light rays crossing the plane gravitational wave are focussed by that wave .",
    "let @xmath3 with @xmath4 be rectangular cartesian coordinates and time in minkowskian space ",
    "time , in terms of which the line  element reads ( taking the velocity of light @xmath5 ) @xmath6 let @xmath7 be the parametric equations of the time  like world  line in minkowskian space ",
    "time of a charge @xmath0 having @xmath8 as proper  time or arc length along it .",

    "like 4vector orthogonal to @xmath23 .",
    "the skew  symmetric tensor @xmath26 in ( [ 2.4 ] ) is petrov type n with degenerate principal null direction @xmath23 and thus the leading term in the electromagnetic field of the charge ( [ 2.3 ] ) describes the radiation part of the field .",
    "the presence of this term is due entirely to the acceleration @xmath27 of the charge .",
    "suppose now that at @xmath28 ( say ) on the world  line of the charge , the charge receives an impulsive acceleration ( there is sudden change in the 4velocity of the charge at @xmath28 leading to a dirac delta function @xmath29 in the 4acceleration of the charge ) then one would expect the resulting retarded radiation , described by @xmath26 above , to take the form of an impulsive electromagnetic wave with history the future null  cone @xmath28 and with profile @xmath29",
    ". however this information can not readily be extracted from ( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.4])(2.5 ) because , among other things , @xmath15 in ( [ 2.2 ] ) is now not defined at @xmath28 since there is no unique tangent to the world ",
    "line of the charge at @xmath28 . to see this",
    "clearly let us take the vertex of the future null ",
    "cone @xmath30 to be the origin of the coordinates @xmath3 ( and so @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus if @xmath32 is an event on @xmath2 then @xmath13 satisfies @xmath33 this is given in a useful parametric form by @xmath34 with @xmath35 a complex variable with complex conjugate @xmath36 and @xmath37 a real variable . putting @xmath38 and substituting ( [ 2.8 ] ) into the minkowskian line  element ( [ 2.1 ] )",
    "yields the induced line ",
    "element on @xmath2 @xmath39    in figure 1 , @xmath40 is orthogonal to @xmath41 and @xmath42 while @xmath43 is orthogonal to @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ". then the retarded distances @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given by ( using ( [ 2.2 ] ) with @xmath48 ) @xmath49 and @xmath50 substituting from ( [ 2.8 ] ) into these we obtain @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the same function as @xmath54 but with @xmath41 in @xmath54 replaced by @xmath44 .",
    "hence we see from ( [ 2.12 ] ) that we have the _ invariant statement _ @xmath55 and the line  element ( [ 2.9 ] ) reads @xmath56 thus ( [ 2.14 ] ) is a change of affine parameter along the generator @xmath57 of @xmath2 ( op in figure 1 ) which ( a ) leaves the vertex of @xmath2 fixed and ( b ) leaves the induced metric on @xmath2 invariant .",
    "we now consider the following type of motion of the charge @xmath0 : in the frame of reference with respect to which the coordinates @xmath3 are measured ( the laboratory frame ) the charge moves with uniform 3velocity @xmath1 in the @xmath58direction when @xmath59 ( i.e. to the past of the null  cone @xmath2 ) .",
    "when @xmath60 ( to the future of the null  cone @xmath2 ) the charge is taken to be at rest in this frame .",
    "thus for @xmath59 the world ",
    "line of the charge is the time  like geodesic with unit tangent ( 4velocity ) @xmath61 with @xmath62 . for @xmath60 the world ",

    "the line  element of minkowskian space  time in the region @xmath60 to the future of the null  cone @xmath30 and which we denote by @xmath68 is , in coordinates @xmath69 , @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 corresponding to @xmath28 .",
    "we then attach the two halves of minkowskian space ",
    "time @xmath64 and @xmath68 on @xmath73 with the _ matching conditions _",
    "( [ 2.14 ] ) ) @xmath74 thus in particular the line  elements induced on @xmath2 by its embedding in @xmath64 and @xmath68 , calculated from ( [ 2.18 ] ) with @xmath28 and from ( [ 2.20 ] ) with @xmath72 are the same induced line  elements .",
    "a more convenient form for ( [ 2.18 ] ) for our purposes is obtained by introducing the coordinates @xmath75 via @xmath76 which results in ( [ 2.18 ] ) becoming @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "also if @xmath79 are given by ( [ 2.23 ] ) with @xmath80 replaced by @xmath81 we find that ( [ 2.20 ] ) becomes @xmath82 the _ matching conditions _ ( [ 2.22 ] ) now read : on @xmath83 @xmath84    to interpret physically what the geometrical construction above is describing we note the following : the line  elements ( [ 2.24 ] ) and ( [ 2.25 ] ) are two versions of the minkowski line  element which can be transformed one into the other by the coordinate transformation @xmath85 here @xmath1 is a real parameter with @xmath86 .",
    "the transformation ( [ 3.3 ] ) is in fact a lorentz transformation as it can be shown if one rewrites the line elements ( [ 2.24 ] ) and ( [ 2.25 ] ) in terms of the rectangular cartesian coordinates and time @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the relations between these two sets of coordinates and the coordinates @xmath89 and @xmath90 are given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 in terms of the coordinates @xmath87 and @xmath88 the line elements ( [ 2.24 ] ) and ( [ 2.25 ] ) take the usual form ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore the relationship between @xmath87 and @xmath93 corresponding to ( [ 3.3 ] ) is obtained directly from substituting ( [ 3.3 ] ) into ( 2.32)(2.35 ) and using ( 2.28)(2.31 ) .",
    "the result is the lorentz transformation @xmath94 where , as always , @xmath62 .",
    "we now wish to calculate the maxwell field due to the charge @xmath0 performing the motion described above . to this end",
    "we first express the line  element of @xmath95 in continuous coordinates @xmath96 . by this",
    "we mean coordinates in which the metric tensor components are continuous across @xmath2 . in such a coordinate system",
    "we find that the line  element can be written @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "the coordinate ranges are @xmath99 . here",
    "@xmath2 is given by @xmath100 , @xmath64 by @xmath101 and @xmath68 by @xmath102 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in these coordinates the metric tensor components are independent of @xmath103 . also when @xmath102 , ( [ 2.25 ] ) is transformed to ( [ 2.27 ] ) with @xmath104 where @xmath105 clearly when @xmath101 , ( [ 2.24 ] ) is transformed into ( [ 2.27 ] ) by the identity transformation @xmath106 we see from ( [ 2.28])([2.32 ] ) and ( [ 2.33 ] ) that on @xmath107 @xmath108 which agrees with the _ matching conditions _ ( [ 2.26 ] ) .",
    "in addition it follows from ( [ 2.27 ] ) that the space ",
    "time @xmath95 is flat everywhere .",
    "in particular the riemann tensor vanishes _ on _",
    "@xmath2 for the _ matching conditions _ ( [ 2.34 ] ) and thus @xmath2 is not the history of a light ",
    "like signal such as an impulsive gravitational wave , a gravitational shock wave or a light ",
    "like shell of matter .",
    "hence our geometrical construction has not introduced extra gravitational efffects and describes a pure electromagnetic phenomenon .",
    "this had to be checked as it is well known that glueing two flat spacetimes on a null hypersurface can lead to a riemann tensor which does not vanish on this null hypersurface , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic field due to the charge @xmath0 in @xmath64 and in @xmath68 is the coulomb field .",
    "thus the electromagnetic 4potential on @xmath95 is given via the 1form field ( in the continuous coordinates @xmath109 ) @xmath110 with @xmath111 given in terms of @xmath112 by ( [ 2.28 ] ) , ( 2.29 ) and where @xmath113 is the heaviside step function ( equal to zero when @xmath101 and equal to unity when @xmath102 ) .",

    "we shall denote the corresponding coulomb field 2forms ( the exterior derivatives of @xmath115 and @xmath117 ) by @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively .",
    "noting from ( [ 2.28 ] ) , ( 2.29 ) that @xmath121 we find that the candidate for maxwell 2form on @xmath95 is @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the dirac delta function singular on @xmath124 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath119 and @xmath120 are given below in ( [ 2.57 ] ) and ( [ 2.58 ] ) .",
    "we remark that in terms of the basis 1forms on @xmath95 , @xmath125 we can write ( [ 2.38 ] ) as @xmath126 we note that the @xmath127function part is petrov type n with degenerate principal null direction given via the 1form @xmath128 . thus the principal null direction is that of the vector field @xmath129 .    to prove that ( [ 2.41 ] )",
    "is a vacuum maxwell field on @xmath95 excluding @xmath130 , but including the future null ",

    "therefore ( [ 2.41 ] ) is a vacuum maxwell field for all @xmath103 and for @xmath142 . the final",
    "( type n ) term in ( [ 2.41 ] ) thus represents a spherical impulsive electromagnetic wave having the future null ",

    "null tetrad .",
    "the tetrad defined via the 1forms @xmath143 with @xmath144 is an orthonormal tetrad .",
    "the final term in the electromagnetic field ( [ 2.41 ] ) when written on this orthonormal tetrad reads @xmath145 thus in the laboratory frame @xmath146 corresponds to an electric 3vector and a magnetic 3vector given respectively by @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath149 a measure of the intensity of this electromagnetic wave is given by @xmath150 a measure of the total intensity , @xmath151 , of this wave is got by integrating ( [ 2.54 ] ) over the spherical wave ",
    "front @xmath152 .",
    "the area element , obtained from ( [ 2.27 ] ) , is @xmath153 with @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "one readily verifies that the total area of the wave  front is @xmath156 and that @xmath157 for @xmath86 .",
    "this is typical of the 3velocity dependence of the total intensity of electromagnetic bremsstrahlung ( see , for example , jackson s @xcite discussion of beta decay ) . for",
    "the charge @xmath0 above the deceleration from 3velocity @xmath1 to zero 3velocity in the laboratory frame is instantaneous ( at @xmath100 ) and since ( [ 2.56 ] ) has the characteristic 3velocity dependence of electromagnetic bremsstrahlung we shall refer to the radiation described by ( [ 2.511 ] ) as _ instantaneous electromagnetic bremsstrahlung_. it is an important example of an impulsive electromagnetic wave because ( a ) its origin is known ( it is due to the sudden change in the 4velocity of the charge ) and ( b ) it is free from unphysical directional singularities .",
    "the approach to instantaneous electromagnetic bremsstrahlung given in this section leads naturally to the gravitational analogue described in section 3 . for a treatment of instantaneous electromagnetic bremsstrahlung that does not involve the `` cut and paste '' procedure , see appendix a.",
    "we consider now the analogous situation for a spherically symmetric mass @xmath158 in general relativity to that of the charge @xmath0 discussed in the previous section .",
    "we shall first describe our geometrical model and then physically interpret it .",

    "a burst of null matter predominantly in the direction of motion is required to halt the mass . in this sense the model we have constructed here could be thought of as a limiting case of a kinnersley rocket @xcite @xcite .    by integrating ( [ 18 ] ) over the shell with area element @xmath228 and with @xmath229 we obtain the total energy @xmath230 of the shell measured by the distant observer who sees the mass @xmath158 , moving rectilinearly with 3velocity @xmath1 in the direction @xmath226 , suddenly halted .",
    "thus @xmath231 this results in @xmath232 so the energy of the light ",
    "like shell is the difference in the relative masses before and after the emission of the light ",
    "like shell .",
    "if one wants to exhibit the conservation of energy one can also interpret ( [ 20 ] ) by saying that , in the reference frame @xmath233 where the mass @xmath160 is at rest , the energy @xmath234 of the ingoing mass is transfered into the rest energy @xmath160 plus the energy @xmath230 of the emitted null shell .",
    "when @xmath235 @xmath236 the energy of the shell is the difference in the rest ",
    "masses ( naturally taking @xmath237 ) and this is a well  known result @xcite which may also be thought of as a limiting case of the vaidya @xcite solution . if @xmath238 and @xmath239 then @xmath240 in this case all of the kinetic energy of the mass @xmath158 before stopping is converted into the relativistic shell .",
    "the simplest way of interpreting our solution is that it represents the field outside a moving spherical body ( a star for instance ) which , at a certain moment of retarded time , suddenly stops as a consequence of some internal process such as a laser - like nuclear reaction .",
    "the emission of a sharp burst of null matter ( photons or neutrinos ) predominantly in the forward direction provides the recoil momentum which is necessary to put the body at rest .",
    "as we are only interested in the outside field we have not made any assumption about the structure of the body except that it is spherically symmetric and is initially moving with constant velocity . if we were to describe the global structure of spacetime two possibilities",
    "would have to be considered .",
    "the first one would correspond to a point  like body , and the maximal analytic extension of spacetime would then show that the light ",
    "like shell emerges from the white  hole region and propagates radially to future null infinity .",
    "this situation , which appears to be the closest analogue of the charged particle described in section 2 , is of limited physical significance .",
    "the second possibility would be that the body has some finite radius larger than its gravitational radius .",
    "this is more realistic as it avoids the white - hole region and in particular the shell starting from the white - hole singularity . here",
    "only the outside region has to be considered and the light  like shell is directly emitted from the surface of the body .",
    "the idea of an extended body remaining rotationally symmetric when suddenly decelerated to rest is , of course , a strong idealization .",
    "more realistically , one would expect the body to undergo some deformations and , thereby , to emit gravitational radiation .",
    "such deformation effects , treated with the help of approximation methods , could be the subject of further studies , using the idealized situation considered in this paper as the starting point .",
    "the time reverse of both of the above possibilities involves impulsive acceleration arising from a radially imploding shell of null matter ( for the first possibility the white  hole is now replaced by a black  hole ) .",
    "it is not surprising that the recoil effect described above does not produce an impulsive gravitational wave since the lowest multipole of an isolated body that contributes to gravitational radiation is the quadrupole and the change of motion that we have considered here only brings a dipole moment .",
    "although the light  like shell above is ( geometrically ) spherically symmetric its energy density ( 3.20 ) is not , and is concentrated in the forward direction of motion .",
    "we have pointed out following ( 3.20 ) that in effect it is the axial symmetry of the energy density ( 3.20 ) which explains why the burst of null matter can result in zero recoil velocity of the moving source .",
    "impulsive gravitational waves which are spherical , in the sense that they have a future null  cone history , do exist but they contain line singularities @xcite and thus are not really spherically symmetric .",
    "if a system with multipole moments experiences an explosion , such as a supernova , which suddenly changes those moments then the sudden change in the quadrupole moment is the dominant contribution to an asymptotically spherical impulsive gravitational wave @xcite .",
    "we illustrate here some interesting calculations that can be carried out using the instantaneous electromagnetic bremsstrahlung described in section 2 by the final term in ( [ 2.41 ] ) . as penrose",
    "@xcite says:this retarded radiation approximates a purely impulsive electromagnetic wave in the far zone , but after an encounter with a gravitational plane ( impulsive ) wave , the electromagnetic wave back  scatters and so ceases to satisfy huygen s principle \" .",
    "since we have in our possession in ( [ 2.41 ] ) an analytic expression for the electromagnetic wave , we wish to use it to give an analytic description of the remainder of the situation envisaged by penrose and in particular to exhibit the back  scattered electromagnetic radiation .",
    "we therefore first must take the  plane wave limit \" of ( [ 2.41 ] ) . to do this",
    "we make use of a device invented by robinson and trautman @xcite and developed in the context of linard  wiechert electromagnetic fields by hogan and ellis @xcite .",
    "we want to find expression for a limit of ( [ 2.41 ] ) which captures the idea that we are viewing ( [ 2.41 ] ) at a large distance from the charge @xmath0 and over not too large regions of space .",
    "this can be achieved by first making the coordinate transformation @xcite @xmath241 where @xmath242 is a real parameter . if this is applied to the line  element ( [ 2.27 ] ) of @xmath95 and then the limit @xmath243 taken , the result is the line ",
    "element @xmath244 if in addition ( 4.1),(4.2 ) is applied to the maxwell field ( [ 2.41 ] ) in its form ( [ 2.38 ] ) and at the same time the charge @xmath0 is rescaled according to @xcite @xmath245 then for small @xmath242 we find , using ( [ 2.47 ] ) and ( [ 2.48 ] ) that @xmath246 while @xmath247 thus in the limit @xmath243 the electromagnetic field ( [ 2.38 ] ) becomes @xmath248 this is a plane impulsive electromagnetic wave with history the null hyperplane @xmath249 in minkowskian space ",
    "time with line  element ( [ 4.3 ] ) and with propagation direction @xmath250 in this space  time .",
    "we note that evidence of the origin of the wave ( [ 4.7 ] ) in the presence of the velocity parameter @xmath1 has survived the plane wave limit .",
    "we now consider the head  on collision of this plane wave with a plane impulsive gravitational wave .",
    "the space - time picture of the process is given in figure 2 .",
    "the half space ",
    "time @xmath251 has line  element ( [ 4.3 ] ) while the half space ",
    "time @xmath252 has line ",
    "element @xcite @xmath253 where @xmath54 is constant .",
    "these are both regions of minkowskian space time .",
    "the riemann tensor of the space  time in figure 2 has one non  vanishing newman ",
    "penrose component @xmath254 and is therefore type n in the petrov classification with @xmath255 as degenerate principal null direction .",
    "thus if @xmath256 then @xmath257 in figure 2 is the history of a plane impulsive gravitational wave .",
    "also in figure 2 , @xmath258 is the history of the plane impulsive electromagnetic wave ( [ 4.7 ] ) which collides head  on with the gravitational wave .",
    "we thus have no maxwell field within regions i , ii and iii and we solve maxwell s vacuum field equations in region iv assuming no maxwell field on the boundary @xmath259 and an impulsive electromagnetic wave on the boundary @xmath260 . in terms of the basis 1forms in the region",
    "@xmath252 , @xmath261 we find that the maxwell 2form @xmath262 and its dual @xmath263 in the region @xmath252 is given by @xmath264 thus the maxwell 2form in @xmath252 is @xmath265 if the gravitational wave is removed by putting @xmath266 then ( [ 4.12 ] ) becomes the plane electromagnetic wave ( [ 4.7 ] ) .",
    "the _ first _ term in ( [ 4.12 ] ) is type n in the petrov classification with degenerate principal null direction @xmath250 and is an impulsive electromagnetic wave with history @xmath260 and with propagation direction @xmath267 .",
    "the geodesic integral curves of @xmath267 generate @xmath268 and have expansion @xmath269 and shear @xmath270 .",
    "thus @xmath268 is not a hyper_plane _ and so this impulsive wave is not a plane wave .",
    "the _ second _ term in ( [ 4.12 ] ) , which is non ",
    "zero for @xmath271 , is type n in the petrov classification with degenerate principal null direction @xmath255 .",
    "thus this term describes _",
    "electromagnetic back  scattered radiation _ in region iv @xmath272 of figure 2 with propagation direction @xmath255 .",
    "the integral curves of @xmath255 are twist ",
    "free , expansion ",
    "free , shear ",
    "free null geodesics generating the null hyperplanes @xmath273 .",
    "hence the histories of the wave fronts of this back  scattered electromagnetic radiation are null hyperplanes .",
    "finally we note that the maxwell field described by ( [ 4.11 ] ) in region @xmath252 becomes singular when @xmath274 where the null geodesics tangent to @xmath250 are focussed after passing through the gravitational wave ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "section 2 above and this section taken together give analytical expression to a fascinating space  time diagram ( figure 4 ) in @xcite .",
