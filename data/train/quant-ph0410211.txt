    "the no - cloning theorem  @xcite states that it is impossible to make perfect copies of an unknown quantum state . at variance with the classical world , where it is possible to duplicate information faithfully",
    ", the unitarity of time evolution in quantum mechanics does not allow us to build a perfect quantum copying machine .",
    "this no - go theorem is at the root of the security of quantum cryptography  @xcite , since an eavesdropper is unable to copy the information transmitted through a quantum channel without disturbing the communication itself .",
    "although perfect cloning is not allowed , it is , nevertheless , possible to produce several approximate copies of a given state .",
    "several works , starting from the seminal paper by buek and m. hillery  @xcite , have been devoted to find the upper bounds to the fidelity of approximate cloning transformations compatible with the rules of quantum mechanics .",
    "besides the theoretical interest on its own , applications of quantum cloning can be found in quantum cryptography , because they allow us to derive bounds for the security in quantum communication  @xcite , in quantum computation , where quantum cloning can be used to improve the performance of some computational tasks  @xcite , and in the problem of state estimation @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the efficiency of the cloning transformations is usually quantified in terms of the fidelity of each output cloned state with respect to the input .",
    "the largest possible fidelity depends on several parameters and on the characteristics of the input states . for an @xmath4 cloner it depends on the number @xmath5 of the input states and on the number @xmath6 of output copies .",
    "it also depends on the dimension of the quantum systems to be copied",
    ". moreover , the fidelity increases if some prior knowledge of the input states is assumed . in the universal cloning machine",
    "the input state is unknown .",
    "a better fidelity is achieved , for example , in the phase covariant cloner ( pcc ) where the state is known to lie on the equator of the bloch sphere ( in the case of qubits ) .",
    "upper bounds to the fidelity for copying a quantum state were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite in the case of universal and state dependent cloning respectively .",
    "the more general problem of copying @xmath2 qubits has been also addressed  @xcite .",
    "the pcc has been proposed in ref .",
    "several protocols for implementing cloning machines have been already achieved experimentally  @xcite . in all the above proposals",
    "the cloning device is described in terms of quantum gates , or otherwise is based on post - selection methods .",
    "for example , the quantum network corresponding to the @xmath7 pcc consists of two controlled - not ( c - not ) gates together with a controlled rotation  @xcite .",
    "the implementation of given tasks by means of quantum gates is not the the only way to execute the required quantum protocols .",
    "recently it has been realized that there are situations where it is sufficient to find a proper architecture for the qubit network and an appropriate form for the coupling between qubits to achieve the desired task . under these conditions",
    "the execution of a quantum protocol is reached by the time evolution of the quantum - mechanical system .",
    "the only required control is on the preparation of the initial state of the network and on the read - out after the evolution .",
    "this perspective is certainly less flexible than the traditional approach with quantum gates .",
    "nevertheless it offers great advantages as it does _ not _ require any time modulation for the qubits couplings .",
    "moreover , among the reasons for this `` no - control '' approach to quantum information is that the system is better isolated from the environment during its evolution .",
    "this is because there is no active control on the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "actually , after initializing the network one needs only to wait for some time ( to be determined by the particular task ) and then read the output .",
    "several examples have been provided so far .",
    "a spin network for quantum computation based only on heisenberg interactions has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "another area where this approach is attracting increasing attention is quantum communication , where spin chains have been proposed as natural candidates of quantum channels  @xcite .",
    "an unknown quantum state can be prepared at one end of the chain and then transferred to the other end by simply employing the ability of the chain to propagate the state by means of its dynamical evolution .",
    "these proposals seem to be particularly suited for solid state quantum information , where schemes for implementation have already been put forward  @xcite .    stimulated by the above results in quantum communication we have studied quantum cloning in this framework .",
    "the main goal is to find a spin network and an interaction hamiltonian such that at the end of its evolution the initial state of a spin is ( imperfectly ) copied on the state of a suitable set of the remaining spins . in this paper",
    "we will show that this is indeed possible and we will analyze various types of quantum cloners based on the procedure just described . we will describe a setup for the @xmath4 pcc and we will show that for @xmath8 and @xmath9 the spin network cloning ( snc ) achieves the optimal bound .",
    "we will also describe the more general situation of cloning of qudits , i.e. d - level systems .",
    "an important test is to compare the performance of our snc with the traditional approach using quantum gates .",
    "we show that in the ( unavoidable ) presence of noise our method is far more robust .",
    "some of the results have been already given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will give many additional details , not contained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and extend our approach to cloning to several other situations .",
    "we discuss cloning of qutrits , universal cloning machines , and optimization of the model hamiltonian just to mention few extentions .",

    "we review the basic properties of approximate cloning showing the theoretical optimal bounds . in section  [ sec : snc ]",

    "these sections concern the spin network model to implement the @xmath10 and @xmath4 phase covariant cloning transformations respectively .",
    "in addition to a more detailed discussion , as compared to @xcite , here we present a detailed analysis of the role of static imperfections .",
    "we also optimize the cloning protocol over the space of a large class of model hamiltonians which includes the @xmath0 and heisenberg as limiting cases .",
    "the effects of noise , included in a fully quantum mechanical approach , are analyzed in section  [ sec : noise ] , where we compare our cloning setup with cloning machines based on a gate design . in sect .",
    "[ sec : univ ] we study the possibility of achieving universal cloning with the spin network approach . in section [ sec : qudits ] we generalize the snc for qutrits and qudits .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : implementation ] we propose a simple josephson junctions circuit that realizes the protocol and in [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize the main results and present our conclusions .",
    "most of this paper deals with the case of pcc .",
    "we will therefore devote this section to a brief summary of the results known so far for the optimal fidelity achievable in this case .",
    "we start our discussion by considering quantum cloning of qubits , whose hilbert space is spanned by the basis states @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the most general state of a qubit can be parametrized by the angles @xmath13 on the bloch sphere as follows @xmath14 quantum cloning was first analyzed @xcite , where the @xmath15 universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) was introduced .",
    "we remind that the fidelity of a uqcm does not depend on @xmath13 i.e. it is the same for all possible input states .",
    "as already mentioned , the quality of the cloner is quantified by means of the fidelity @xmath16 of each output copy , described by the density operator @xmath17 , with respect to the original state @xmath18 @xmath19 the value of the optimal fidelity is achieved by maximizing @xmath20 over all possible cloning transformations . the result for",
    "the @xmath7 uqcm is @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the general form of the optimal transformation , which requires an auxiliary qubit , has been explicitly obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the initial state is known to be in a given subset of the bloch sphere , the value of the optimal fidelity generally increases .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite cloning of just two non orthogonal states is studied and it is shown that the fidelity in this case is greater than that for the uqcm .",
    "the reason is that now some prior knowledge information on the input state is available",
    ". another important class of transformations , which will be largely analyzed in the present paper , is the so called phase covariant cloning . in this type of cloner",
    "the fidelity is optimised equally well for all states belonging to the equator of the bloch sphere : @xmath22 where @xmath23 $ ] .",

    "we defined @xmath41 and @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "the expressions for the fidelities given above will be compared to the ones derived by means of the approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present paper .",
    "in this section we show how quantum cloning can be implemented using a spin network .",
    "first let us discuss our hamiltonian model .",
    "we start with a fairly general model defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the pauli matrices corresponding to the @xmath46-th site , @xmath47 are the exchange couplings defined on the links joining the sites @xmath46 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 is an externally applied magnetic field .",

    "it turns out that for pcc the @xmath56 case leads always to the highest fidelity .",
    "given the model of eq .",
    "the fidelity is maximized over @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we defined @xmath59 and @xmath60 the values of the parameters leading to the optimal solution .",
    "notice that the total angular momentum as well as its @xmath61 component are always constants of motion independently of the topology of the network . in all the cases we consider in this work ,",
    "the couplings @xmath62 only for nearest neighbors sites @xmath63 . to specify which couplings are non - zero one has to define the topology of the spin network .    for the @xmath10 pcc we choose @xmath64 spins in a star configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : network]a ) . the central spin labeled by @xmath52",
    "is initialized in the input state while the remaining m spins are the blank qubits and are initialized to the state @xmath11 if @xmath65 and @xmath12 if @xmath66 . for this network",
    "@xmath67 only if one of the two linked sites is the central one .",
    "this configuration has also been studied in a different context  @xcite . for the @xmath10 case",
    "we have considered also other types of networks .",
    "these are represented in fig.[fig : network]b .",
    "the original state is placed on the top of the tree while the blank qubits are on the lowest level .",
    "the intermediary spins are ancillae . each graph is characterized by the number @xmath32 of links departing from each site and the number @xmath48 of intermediate levels between the top and the blank qubits level .",
    "the number of blank qubits can be obtained from @xmath48 and @xmath32 as @xmath68 .",
    "notice that for this class of graphs a symmetry property holds : the global state of the blank qubits is invariant under any permutation of the @xmath6 qubits . for the @xmath4 pcc we have considered a generalization of the star network ( see fig.[fig : network]c ) .",
    "it consists of a star with n centers and m tips so no auxiliary qubits are present .",
    "also this network is permutation invariant .",
    "the cases defined above are not the most general networks and/or model hamiltonian conceivable .",
    "since the fidelity must be maximized over the parameters of the hamiltonian as well as over the network topology one may wonder whether it is sufficient to consider only the cases introduced above . in section [ sec : maxham ]",
    "we partially answer to this question by considering the more general configuration for the @xmath69 case containing @xmath70 spins and we believe to have found the best possible scenario for the snc . as far as the choice of the model hamiltonian is concerned , the symmetry in the @xmath0-plane is suggested by the phase covariance requirement for a pcc .",
    "we checked that the ising model in transverse field , which is not phase covariant , gives poorer results for the fidelity . in principle one",
    "should also explore the possibility of multi - bit couplings , but we did not considered this ( in principle interesting ) situation .",
    "multi - bit couplings are much more difficult to achieve experimentally and at the end of this work we want to propose to implement our scheme using josephson nanocircuits , where two - qubit couplings with @xmath0-symmetry are easy to realize .",

    "the operators @xmath75 obey the usual commutation relations for an angular momentum operator . notice that the modulus and the @xmath61 component of the total angular momentum @xmath76 commute with the hamiltonian . thus the evolution is invariant under rotations around the @xmath61 axis .",
    "this property automatically makes our model a pcc .    for @xmath65 ( the other case is equivalent ) the initial state of the star",

    "second let us consider @xmath110 and arbitrary m",
    "( see fig.[fig:1mcloning ] ) : @xmath111 for @xmath112 , @xmath113 is always smaller than the optimal fidelity given in ref.@xcite .",
    "also in this case the xy model is better suited for quantum cloning as compared to the heisenberg case .",
    "although for generic @xmath6 the snc does not saturate the optimal bound , there is a very appealing feature of this methods which makes it interesting also in this case . the time required to clone the state",
    "_ decreases _ with @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that , in the presence of noise , snc may be competitive with the quantum circuit approach , where the number of gates are expected to _ increase _ with @xmath6 .",
    "we analyze this point in section [ sec : noise ] .",
    "recently a pcc with the star configuration has been proposed also for a multi - qubit cavity @xcite . in this proposal",
    "the central spin is replaced by a bosonic mode of the cavity . by restricting the dynamics in the subspace with only one excitation ( one excited qubit or one photon in the cavity )",
    "the hamiltonian is equivalent to the @xmath0 spin star network considered here .",
    "indeed the optimal fidelities coincide with @xmath114 , eq ..     for pcc ( circle ) , @xmath0 ( diamond ) and heisenberg ( triangle ) as functions of @xmath6 for @xmath110 . ]",
    "all the results discussed so far have been obtained for the star network .",
    "obviously this is not the only choice which fulfills the symmetries of a quantum cloning network . in general one",
    "should also consider more general topologies and understand to what extent the fidelity depends on the topology .",
    "we analyzed this issue by studying the fidelity for the @xmath0 model and @xmath115 for @xmath116 for the graph b of fig.[fig : network ] ( the fidelity for heisenberg model in this case is much worse than in the star configuration ) .",
    "we conclude that the maximum fidelity obtained does not depend on the chosen graph .",
    "to assess the robustness of our protocol , it is important to analyze the effect of static imperfections in the network . in a nanofabricated network , as for example with josephson nanocircuits",
    ", one may expect small variations in the qubit couplings . here",
    "we analyze the @xmath25 cloning assuming that the couplings @xmath47 have a certain degree of randomness .",
    "for each configuration of disorder @xmath117 are assigned in an interval of amplitude @xmath118 centered around @xmath119 with a uniform distribution .",
    "first we study the case of uncorrelated disorder in different links .",
    "the values of @xmath49 and @xmath82 are chosen to be the optimal values of the ideal situation . for a given configuration of the couplings",
    "the fidelities of each of the clones are different due to the different coupling with the central spin .",
    "only the average fidelity is again symmetric under permutation among the clones .",
    "we averaged the fidelity over the @xmath6 sites and over @xmath120 realization of disorder . for @xmath121 and @xmath122 the mean fidelity decreases by just less than @xmath123 of the optimal value .",
    "it is important to stress that the effect of imperfections is quite weak on the average fidelity .",
    "this is because for certain values of @xmath47 , even if the fidelity of a particular site can become much larger than the fidelity in the absence of disorder , at the same time for the same parameters the fidelity in other sites is very small and the average fidelity is weakly affected by imperfections . in figure",
    "[ fig : imper ] we show the fidelity for the @xmath7 snc with imperfections as a function of the tolerance @xmath124 .",

    "however this is not the case for @xmath129 , at least for the network topologies considered up to now .",
    "one may wonder whether a different choice for the network could allow to approach the optimal fidelity . in order to understand this point we studied the simplest non trivial case namely @xmath130 and considered the tetrahedron network shown in fig.[fig : tetra ] .",
    "cloning . ]",
    "we concentrated on the general anisotropic @xmath53 model presented in in which the local magnetic field and the couplings between the central spin and the blank spin can be different .",
    "this is the most general hamiltonian for @xmath70 spins that fulfills the symmetry and covariance property . for this general model we maximized analytically the on - site fidelity diagonalizing the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "we found that the maximum fidelity exactly coincides with that found with the simple star configuration .",
    "it is thus demonstrated that , at least for @xmath131 , the star configuration is the optimal network for cloning .",
    "it is however important to stress that , given the transformation for the optimal pcc , it is always possible to find a hamiltonian that generates this transformation during the dynamical evolution .",
    "therefore , at least in principle , one should be able to saturate the optimal value by including other terms in the hamiltonian ( multi - spin coupling for example ) .",

    "we have demonstrated that quantum cloning , in particular pcc , can be realized using no external control but just with an appropriate design of the system hamiltonian .",

    "we have analyzed ( @xmath227 pcc , universal cloning , cloning of qudits ) our protocol gives a value of the fidelity of clones that is always within a few percent of the optimal value . as compared to the standard protocol using quantum gates , however , there is a major advantage .",
    "our setup is fast and , moreover , its execution time does not increase with the number of qubits to be cloned . in the presence of noise",
    "this allows to reach a much better fidelity than the standard protocol even in the presence of a weak coupling to the external environment .",
    "in addition we expect that the system in the snc is better isolated from the external environment because no gate pulses are needed .",
    "finally we proposed a possible implementation of our scheme using superconducting devices available with present day technology .",
    "this would be the first experimental realization of quantum cloning in solid state systems .",
    "we want to stress that our results on cloning together with others on communication and computation open new perspectives in the realization of a quantum processor , reducing the effect of noise on the system . it would be interesting to consider if it is possible to realize other quantum information protocols or quantum algorithms , using time independent spin networks .",
