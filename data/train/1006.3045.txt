    "low energy supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite has several features that make it very promising as a class of models for beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics@xcite . the minimal supergravity ( msugra)@xcite is a well - studied model that greatly reduces the number of parameters of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite through a few simple requirements .",
    "the universal input parameters given at the unification scale are : ( i ) the gaugino mass parameter @xmath10 , ( ii ) the scalar mass parameter @xmath11 , and ( iii ) the trilinear susy breaking parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the model that uses radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry requires another parameter @xmath1 which is the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "additionally the sign of the higgsino mixing parameter @xmath12 is an input .",
    "with r - parity@xcite assumed to be preserved , the model has an attractive dark matter@xcite candidate , namely the lightest neutralino @xmath0 which is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) for most of the parameter space . in a scenario where @xmath0 is the lsp ,",
    "the parameter space with other sparticles lighter than @xmath0 are ignored .",
    "the model is typically associated with a bino - dominated lsp that leads to over - abundance of dark matter .",
    "reduction of the relic density to satisfy the wmap data can be achieved if i ) there is coannihilation of lsp with another sfermion ( usually stau @xmath13 or rarely @xmath14 ) that has mass close to the mass of lsp@xcite , ii ) there is appropriate mixture of bino and higgsinos in the composition of the lsp so that there may be coannihilating charginos in the lsp-@xmath15 annihilation@xcite , the so called focus point@xcite / hyperbolic branch@xcite region , iii ) the lsp is sufficiently small in mass and sfermions are light so that light sfermion exchange may enhance the lsp - lsp annihilation rates , or iv ) there is a possibility of having s - channel higgs exchanges where the exchanges may occur via cp - odd higgs boson @xmath16 or via cp - even heavy ( light ) higgs bosons @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) leading to the `` funnel region '' of dark matter satisfied zone in the @xmath19 plane@xcite .",
    "most recently xenon100@xcite experiment has published an updated result for the exclusion limit of @xmath20 for direct search of dark matter for a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) mass of 50  gev at 90% confidence limit . additionally , the recent 5-tower result of the cdms - ii@xcite experiment published a result of 2 signal events with @xmath21 events as background . as mentioned by the authors",
    ", there is a significant chance that these two events might have been caused by background rather than by any real signal .",
    "however , a low recoil of 12.3 to 15.5 kev@xcite possibly suggests a lighter wimp with a mass not quite far from 100 gev .",
    "we may thus assume that the spin - independent direct detection cross section limit ( @xmath22 ) set by the experiment , namely @xmath23 @xmath24 at a wimp mass in the vicinity of 70  gev may become an interesting zone in the near future in a light lsp scenario .",
    "several analyses have used this theme in the recent past@xcite and there have been several recent works@xcite in susy models in the context of the cdms - ii result . for practical purposes , we will probe the region of @xmath25 to @xmath26 @xmath24 in a lighter lsp scenario ( not too far from 100 gev ) that satisfies the following relic density bounds from wmap@xcite : @xmath27 a possibly preferred scenario where the lsp is light and at the same time is dominated by bino may be achieved if neutralino relic density is brought to an acceptable level ( from a typical over - abundance ) via a light higgs pole annihilation mechanism .",
    "computation of relic density in msugra with nonvanishing trilinear coupling for large @xmath1 showed such a possibility in ref.@xcite that also imposed constraints from flavor physics like that from @xmath28 and @xmath29 . here in this work",
    ", we will particularly explore the reach of the direct detection cross section in relation to any small recoil data of cdms - ii in such a scenario with light higgs pole annihilation .",
    "in addition to imposing the lep2 limit@xcite for @xmath30 , the mass of the light higgs boson , we will also explore the parameter space in regard to the constraints like @xmath28 and @xmath29 processes .",
    "we will particularly discuss the effect of considering nonminimal flavor violating ( non - mfv ) scenarios with a wider point of view that may be considered without affecting much the spectra or the dark matter related results .",
    "we will further probe the possible signatures coming out of lhc in regard to mssm higgs bosons and weakly interacting gauginos @xmath31 in the dark matter satisfied zone with larger direct detection cross section @xmath22 .",
    "we note that lhc may help to probe the mass of the lighter higgs boson ( @xmath30 ) from @xmath32 mode , whereas an existence of light higgs pole annihilation would indicate a light lsp scenario with a value of @xmath33 that would satisfy @xmath34 .",
    "additionally , at the lhc , one would expect to see a signal of three leptons and a missing transverse energy namely @xmath35 mainly from the pair production of @xmath36 followed by their decays via leptonic modes , @xmath37 as a classic signature of susy .",
    "we also note that in regard to the decay @xmath38 , the endpoint of _ opposite sign same flavor _ ( ossf )",
    "dilepton invariant mass distribution @xmath39 leads to a good determination of the mass difference @xmath40@xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we discuss the issues of direct detection of dark matter particularly the spin - independent cross section @xmath22 in relation to the parameter space of msugra that satisfies the wmap data via s - channel higgs pole annihilation . in sec .  3 , we identify the preferred sign of the trilinear coupling in relation to the above s - channel annihilation . in sec .  4 , we discuss the implications of wmap data and low energy constraints on the msugra parameter space that is interesting for a cdms - ii type of event with a small lsp mass . in sec .  5",
    ", we discuss several possible signatures of this scenario at the lhc .",
    "we also comment on how the correlations between different lhc signatures and the direct detection of dark matter may help determine the masses of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "finally , we summarise our findings in sec .",
    "in general , the results of cross section of lsp annihilation to quarks can be used to find the elastic scattering cross section of the lsp with quark , thanks to crossing symmetry .",
    "direct detections of lsps involve measurement of recoil energy of a nucleus due to lsp - nucleon scattering@xcite .",
    "typical detector materials are scintillators like nai , semiconductors like ge and noble liquids like xe .",
    "the elastic scattering of neutralino with nucleons are divided into two types ( i ) spin - independent ( si ) : a neutralino coherently interacts with the nucleus and ( ii ) spin - dependent ( sd ) : a neutralino interacts with matter via axial vector coupling .",
    "the effective lagrangian that describes @xmath43 elastic scattering for a small velocity is given by , @xmath44 here , the first term represents spin - dependent scattering while the second term refers to spin - independent scattering .",
    "the terms assume summing over the quark flavors @xmath45 as well as that for up and down type of quarks ( for @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively ) .",
    "the neutralino - quark coupling coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 contain all susy model dependent information@xcite .",
    "the spin - independent scattering cross section of a neutralino with a target nucleus of proton number ( atomic number ) @xmath50 and neutron number @xmath51 ( @xmath16 being the mass number ) is given by , @xmath52^{2}~. \\label{sitotal}\\ ] ] here , @xmath53 is the reduced mass defined by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 refers to the mass of the nucleus .",
    "the quantities @xmath56 and @xmath57 contain all the information of short - distance physics and nuclear partonic strengths .",
    "these are given by , @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 refer to interactions of neutralino with quarks and gluons ( via quark / squark loop diagrams ) respectively .",
    "for @xmath59 one has , @xmath61 the quantities @xmath62 may be computed from a few hadronic mass data .",
    "the gluon related part namely @xmath63 is given by@xcite , @xmath64 the numerical values of @xmath59 may be seen in ref.@xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath65 by using the code darksusy@xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath65 , the spin - dependent cross section denoted by @xmath66 ( for scattering of lsp with the target nucleus ) does not depend on @xmath16 or @xmath50 , rather it scales with @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the total nuclear spin . in general , the spin - independent neutralino - nucleon scattering cross sections ( where @xmath69 ) are appreciably smaller than the corresponding spin - dependent cross sections ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "however considering the fact that @xmath71 and @xmath72 one finds that @xmath65 to be considerably larger for moderately heavy elements ( @xmath73 ) like xe , ge etc .",
    "the experiments like edelweiss@xcite and cdms@xcite use natural germanium ( almost purely spinless ) as the target material and these hardly have any spin - sensitivities@xcite .",
    "it is important to know the composition of the @xmath74 in terms of bino , wino and higgsinos in mssm while analyzing the wmap satisfied relic density region as well as the lsp - nucleon scattering cross section for a direct detection .",
    "the amount of higgsino mixing in a typically bino - dominated lsp scenario of msugra depends on the relative value of @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( the mass of bino ) .",
    "the scalar cross section depends on t - channel higgs exchange ( @xmath77 ) and s - channel squark exchange diagrams . unless , the squark masses are close to the mass of the lsp",
    ", the higgs exchange diagrams usually dominate over the s - channel diagrams@xcite .",
    "we focus on a decoupling region of higgs@xcite , so that there is a considerable difference of masses between @xmath18 and @xmath17-bosons .",
    "we also focus on the case where lsp is principally composed of bino , @xmath1 is large and there is a resonance annihilation via @xmath18-boson that is consistent with the relic density from the wmap limits .",
    "following the results of refs.@xcite we see that both the contributions involving lighter as well as heavier higgs bosons in the direct detection are important . indeed in the characteristic zone of the parameter space",
    "as mentioned above , the heavier higgs boson contribution becomes dominant in comparison to the contribution from the lighter higgs boson@xcite .",
    "this holds in spite of the fact that @xmath78 can be larger by a factor of 3 to 4 compared to @xmath30 . in this light higgs annihilation zone",
    "we will see that @xmath22 can be large enough to reach the cdms - ii limit .",
    "in this analysis we especially investigate the parameter space that satisfies the relic density limits from wmap data via lsp annihilations through light higgs resonance . this necessitates a closer study of the region with small @xmath10 near its domain just allowed by the lep2 limit of lighter chargino mass @xmath79@xcite .",
    "we will see how the lep2 constraint affects the lowest possible value of @xmath10 in a nonvanishing @xmath2 scenario .",
    "this in turn requires a discussion on the behaviors of i ) @xmath12 and ii ) @xmath80 for a variation of @xmath2 .",
    "we note that in msugra the variation of @xmath12 with @xmath2 has the following pattern . for @xmath81 ,",
    "@xmath75 increases with @xmath82 , whereas @xmath75 increases with @xmath2 as long as @xmath83 . on the other hand , @xmath12 is near its minimum when one has @xmath84 . as a result , one finds that for a given set of @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath1 a change of @xmath2 from @xmath85 to @xmath86 where @xmath87 causes @xmath75 to vary from a large to a larger value .",
    "this in turn causes @xmath15 to be dominated by wino in the region with a smaller @xmath10 , the amount of wino content is larger for the case of @xmath86 in comparison to that of @xmath85 where the same content is still significantly large .",
    "thus , while probing the region of small gaugino masses with wino - dominated @xmath15 , it is important to examine the variation of @xmath80 with nonvanishing @xmath2 . in this context ,",
    "table  [ tabgauginomasses ] shows the masses of electroweak gauginos , the value of higgsino mass parameter , the masses of lighter chargino , lighter neutralino and h - boson for @xmath88 , @xmath89  gev , @xmath90  gev and @xmath91 for @xmath92  gev .",
    "this will indeed demonstrate the effect of two - loop rges along with threshold corrections on the electroweak gaugino masses .",
    "clearly , both @xmath76 and @xmath80 are smaller for @xmath85 in comparison to the same quantities corresponding to @xmath86 . on the other hand ,",
    "the values of @xmath12 for both signs of @xmath2 are sufficiently large so that the lighter chargino as well as the lighter neutralino are both highly gaugino - dominated .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is smaller for @xmath93 .",
    "thus , as we decrease @xmath10 , the lep2 bound of chargino mass is reached at a relatively larger @xmath10 for @xmath85 in comparison to the case of @xmath86 .",
    "similarly , the lep2 limit of @xmath30 is reached at a relatively larger @xmath10 for @xmath85 than the case of @xmath86 .",
    "the latter favors larger loop corrections from the top - stop sector@xcite .    in brief ,",
    "imposition of lep2 bounds of @xmath79 and @xmath30 ( considering also the aforesaid 3  gev theoretical uncertainty ) would allow us to reach to a smaller @xmath10 value for a negative @xmath2 than for a positive @xmath2@xcite . as a result",
    ", bino can be light enough to satisfy a light higgs - pole annihilation condition @xmath34 while obeying the wmap limits in a lep2 satisfied parameter zone .",
    "such a light lsp would undoubtedly be interesting in view of the cdms - ii results with two possible events .",
    ".comparison of spectra electroweak gaugino masses , higgsino masses , the masses of lighter chargino , lighter neutralino and h - boson for @xmath88 , @xmath89  gev , @xmath90  gev and @xmath91 for @xmath92  gev .",
    "this is given as an example to demonstrate the effect of two - loop rges along with threshold corrections on the electroweak gaugino masses which are smaller for @xmath93 .",
    "these are of course not valid parameter points satisfying wmap data for neutralino relic density . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this trilepton signal i.e. , @xmath94 channel , any choice of the three charged leptons ( @xmath95 @xmath96 or @xmath12 ) must consist of an ossf pair and an additional lepton .",
    "the end point of the ossf dilepton invariant mass @xmath97 distribution leads to a good determination of the mass difference @xmath98 @xcite .    on the other hand , after reconstruction of the light higgs boson mass @xmath30 from @xmath18-decays and assuming @xmath18-pole annihilation as the mechanism for satisfying the wmap data , it is possible to estimate the mass @xmath99 , which is @xmath100",
    ". then the mass of @xmath42 may be estimated by combining @xmath99 and with the edge in the @xmath101 distribution .",
    "it may be recalled that for the present choice of benchmark points , @xmath41 is completely bino - dominated , while @xmath42 is wino - dominated .",
    "this leads to one to one correspondence between @xmath102 soft gaugino mass parameter @xmath76 with @xmath99 and @xmath103 soft gaugino mass parameter @xmath80 with @xmath104 .",
    "hence , we expect that the knowledge of both @xmath99 and @xmath104 may be used to determine the mass parameters @xmath105 and @xmath80",
    ". it would be interesting to study whether the mass pattern of @xmath105 and @xmath80 could hint towards the gaugino mass unification which model like msugra assumes .",
    "finally , we conclude this section , by highlighting following important observations :    1 .",
    "the light higgs boson mass can be determined with a reasonably good precision via @xmath106 decay mode .",
    "2 .   in the present scenario , where @xmath107 is large ,",
    "both neutral higgs boson masses can be determined via @xmath108 decay .",
    "both @xmath109 and @xmath110 or equivalently @xmath76 and @xmath80 can be estimated by combining the data from the direct detection of dark matter and the lhc .",
    "4 .   as mentioned before , our choice of parameter space prefers light gluinos and also lighter third generation sleptons and squarks .",
    "this naturally leads to large production rate for gluinos as well as lighter stop and sbottom squarks which in turn give rise to large number of multi @xmath111-jet final states in association with large missing energy both at 7 and 14 tev lhc run .",
    "this will be another striking signature of this scenario .",
    "recent experiments like xenon and cdms - ii provide us with exclusion limits within 3 - 4 @xmath112 for wimp mass in the vicinity of 50 to 70  gev .",
    "cdms - ii results show a 2-signal events with @xmath21 events as background .",
    "it may be possible that these events did not come from any real signal . in spite of this , in case we do not see the events as just background , a low recoil of 12.3 to 15.5 kev could possibly indicate a light wimp detection whose mass could not be too far away than 100  gev .",
    "a large direct detection cross section where lsp is light ( and that also satisfies the wmap data ) in a generic model like msugra can be possible in a parameter space with a large @xmath1 and nonvanishing trilinear coupling @xmath2 .",
    "the relic density constraint is satisfied via h - pole resonant annihilation mechanism . regarding direct detection @xmath3 cross section which reaches the level of the cdms - ii events , both the contributions involving the lighter as well as the heavier higgs bosons are important . in this large @xmath1 ( @xmath113 )",
    "based scenario with bino - dominated @xmath0 , where light higgs pole annihilation brings down the relic density to an acceptable level , the heavier higgs boson contribution indeed dominates .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that @xmath78 can be larger by a factor of 3 to 4 compared to @xmath30 . unlike the past analyses referred in this paper regarding the light higgs - pole dominated lsp pair - annihilation processes for the cases with large values of @xmath1 , here we have worked on the direct detection prospects of the same region in relation to the recent interest of cdms - ii results .",
    "we have further shown in adequate detail the preference of only one sign of @xmath2 that gives feasibility to obtain the desired zone of light - higgs pole annihilation for dark matter .",
    "we particularly perform an open analysis by considering non - mfv assumptions in relation to the @xmath114 and @xmath29 constraints , unlike most other recent works .",
    "we have considered the possibility of general flavor violation on @xmath29 , specifically keeping in mind about the recent analyses as referred in this work . we believe that unless the mfv - based limits from flavor physics are violated by a very large extent , it is important not to discard appropriate scenarios that keep the region with the light higgs - pole dominated pair - annihilation active",
    ". this is particularly relevant because of the ongoing and upcoming precision direct detection dark matter experiments and the advantage of having an associated light higgs spectra as well as a relatively light overall spectra . in the last half of the paper we present a qualitative discussions on the interplay between collider searches for mssm higgs bosons @xmath115 , as well as some other sparticles at the lhc and direct detection of dark matter for the aforementioned parameter space . in particular , we discuss the possibility of determining both @xmath116 and @xmath117 by combining the data from the direct detection of dark matter experiment with that of the edge in the @xmath118 distribution and the light higgs boson mass measurement at the lhc .",
    "we further note that because of @xmath1 being large , copious production of @xmath119 in association with the @xmath111-quark would be possible at the lhc .",
    "such an @xmath120 mass can be reconstructed by looking at the @xmath121 decay mode .",
    "we also point out that large @xmath1 and relatively low @xmath10 values of our benchmark points lead to a large number of multi - b jets in association with missing energy signal .",
