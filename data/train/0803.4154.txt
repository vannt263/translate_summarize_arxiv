    "kondo effect in electronic transport through quantum dots ( qds ) strongly coupled to external leads is a many body phenomenon which occurs at temperatures @xmath1 lower than the so - called kondo temperature @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the kondo temperature is characteristic of a particular system and depends on the corresponding parameters ( energy of the dot level , coupling strength to external leads , coulomb parameter ) .",
    "spin fluctuations in the dot , generated by coupling of the dot to external leads , give rise to a narrow peak in the dot s density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level .",
    "this kondo peak enhances transmission through the dot , and leads to the unitary limit of the linear conductance at zero temperature , where the conductance reaches @xmath4 .",
    "the kondo peak in dos also leads to the so - called zero - bias ( kondo ) anomaly in the differential conductance .",
    "the kondo effect in electronic transport through single quantum dots was extensively studied in the last two decades , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "recently , the kondo - assisted transport through double - dot systems in the t - shaped @xcite , parallel @xcite , and series @xcite geometries also has been addressed .",
    "there are , however , only a few papers on the kondo phenomenon in electronic transport through triple - dot structures @xcite .",
    "such complex dot systems are of current interest from both fundamental and application points of view .",
    "especially the interference effects in electronic transport attract much attention , as the multi - dot systems offer a unique possibility to study fundamental phenomena which earlier were observed in solid state physics and/or quantum optics . by specific design and fabrication of qd systems",
    ", one can investigate for instance the aharonov - bohm oscillations @xcite , fano resonance @xcite , and others .",
    "very recently , the dicke effect , which is well known in atomic optics @xcite , has been predicted also for electronic transport through quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the key feature of the dicke resonance in optics is the presence of a strong and very narrow spontaneous emission line ( in addition to much broader lines ) of a collection of atoms which are separated by a distance smaller than the wavelength of the emitted light @xcite .",
    "generally , the narrow ( broad ) line is associated with a state which is weakly ( strongly ) coupled to the electromagnetic field , and such long - lived ( short - lived ) state is called _ subradiant _ ( _ superradiant _ ) mode . in this paper",
    "we consider another realization of the dicke - like effect , i.e. the kondo - dicke resonances in electronic transport through a system of three coupled quantum dots , where two side - coupled dots are noninteracting ( vanishing coulomb parameter , @xmath5 ) , while the central dot is coupled to the leads and is in the deep kondo regime .",
    "in addition , we also observe behavior of the kondo peak in dos , which resembles the transition from _ subradiant _ to _ superradiant _ mode ( or _ vice versa _ ) in the usual dicke effect .",
    "the theoretical approach we use in this paper is based on the slave - boson technique in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the model of a three - dot system , and present the corresponding hamiltonian in the slave - boson formulation .",
    "the mean - field approach to the problem is described in section 3 .",
    "numerical results on the kondo problem are shown and discussed in section 4 for symmetric and asymmetric systems .",
    "final conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "in this paper we consider a system of three single - level quantum dots . the whole system is coupled to external leads as shown schematically in fig.1 .",
    "the two side dots , labelled as qd1 and qd3 , are coupled to the central dot qd2 _ via _ a direct hopping term .",
    "the dot qd2 , in turn , is additionally attached to external electron reservoirs ( see fig.1 ) . moreover ,",
    "the central dot is assumed to be in the kondo regime , while the side dots are beyond the kondo regime ( for simplicity they are assumed to be noninteracting , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the system under consideration can be modelled by the anderson impurity - like hamiltonian of the following form : @xmath6 the first term describes the left ( @xmath7 ) and right ( @xmath8 ) electrodes in the non - interacting quasi - particle approximation , with @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) being the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with the wave vector @xmath11 and spin @xmath12 in the lead @xmath13 , and with @xmath14 denoting the corresponding single - particle energy .",
    "the next three terms of the hamiltonian describe the system of three coupled quantum dots . here , @xmath15 is the energy of the discrete level in the @xmath16-th dot ( @xmath17 ) , while @xmath18 denotes the hopping parameter between the @xmath19-th dot ( @xmath20 ) and the dot qd2 .",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath18 can be spin dependent in a general case .",
    "furthermore , the term with @xmath0 describes the intra - dot coulomb interactions in the dot qd2 , with @xmath0 denoting the corresponding coulomb integral .",
    "the inter - dot coulomb repulsion , similarly as the intra - dot coulomb interaction for the dots qd1 and qd3 , is assumed to be small and therefore neglected .",
    "the last term of the system s hamiltonian describes electron tunnelling from the leads to the dot qd2 ( or _ vice versa _ ) , with @xmath21 denoting the relevant matrix elements ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "coupling of the dot qd2 to external leads can be parameterized in terms of @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that @xmath24 is constant within the electron band of the leads , @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and @xmath27 otherwise . here",
    ", @xmath28 denotes the electron band width .",
    "@xmath29 describe coupling of the dot qd2 to the external leads , whereas @xmath18 is the hopping parameter between the dot qd2 and the @xmath19-th dot , @xmath20,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the following considerations are restricted to the limit of infinite intra - dot coulomb parameter for the dot qd2 , @xmath30 , so the double occupancy on the central dot is forbidden ( only one electron can reside in the central dot ) .",
    "this assumption allows us to employ the infinite-@xmath0 slave - boson mean - field ( sbmf ) approach @xcite to analyze transport properties .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that the sbmf theory is valid only for low bias at zero temperature .    in the slave - boson approach ,",
    "one introduces a set of auxiliary operators for the central dot . the dot s creation ( annihilation ) operator @xmath31 ( @xmath32",
    "is then replaced with @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) . here , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the slave - boson ( pseudofermion ) annihilation operator for an empty ( singly occupied with a spin-@xmath12 electron ) state of the dot qd2 . to eliminate non - physical states",
    ", the following constraint has to be imposed on the new quasi - particles , @xmath37 equation ( 2 ) is a completeness relation of the hilbert space for the central dot .",
    "accordingly , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be replaced by an effective hamiltonian , expressed in terms of the auxiliary boson @xmath35 and pseudo - fermion @xmath36 operators as @xmath38 the last term with the lagrange multiplier @xmath39 has been introduced to incorporate the constraint for qd2 , given by eq.(2 ) , which prevents double occupancy of the central dot . apart from this ,",
    "@xmath40 in eq.(3 ) stands for the spin - degeneracy of the qd2 .",
    "one can check that the number operator @xmath41 ( see eq.(2 ) ) commutes with this new hamiltonian , so the total particle number of @xmath42-electrons and slave bosons is conserved .",
    "the mean field approximation ( mfa ) adopted to the slave - boson method relies on replacing the boson field @xmath35 by its expectation value . thus , in the lowest order ( in the @xmath43 expansion ) , the slave - boson operator is substituted by a real and independent of time @xmath44 number , @xmath45 .",
    "this approximation neglects fluctuations around the average value @xmath46 of the slave boson operator , but takes into account spin fluctuations ( kondo regime )  exactly at @xmath47 and in the limit of @xmath48 . on the other hand",
    ", one should bear in mind that mfa can not be applied in the mixed - valence regime , where strong charge fluctuations take place .",
    "that is why the mfa approach restricts our considerations to the low bias regime ( @xmath49 ) . introducing the following renormalized parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ,",
    "the effective mfa hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath53    one needs now to find the unknown parameters @xmath54 and @xmath39 .",
    "these can be determined from the constraint imposed on the slave bosons ( eq.(2 ) ) , and from the equation of motion for the slave boson operators .",
    "as a result , one finds two equations , @xmath55    @xmath56    there is also another way to obtain the above equations .",
    "the free parameters @xmath54 and @xmath39 can be determined by minimizing the ground state energy of the effective mfa hamiltonian with respect to these parameters .",
    "application of the hellmann - feynman theorem to the hamiltonian ( 4 ) , together with the conditions for minimal energy @xmath57 , gives a set of self - consistent equations .",
    "these equations in the fourier space read @xmath58    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the fourier transforms of the lesser green functions ; the former being defined as @xmath62 and a similar definition also holds for @xmath63 .    to rewrite eq.(8 ) in a different form ,",
    "we write first the equation of motion for @xmath64 . then",
    ", we multiply this equation by @xmath65 and take the thermal average . upon expressing the obtained equation in terms of the lesser green functions , and taking its hermitian conjugation , one finds @xmath66 when substituting eq.(9 ) into eq.(8 ) , one finally arrives at the equation @xmath67    formulas ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) are our final equations for the unknown parameters . to solve them",
    "one still needs to determine the lesser green function @xmath68 .",
    "this can be derived from the corresponding equation of motion .",
    "similarly , the equation of motion can also be used to derive the retarded green function ( which is also required in our calculations ) . as a result one finds @xmath69 @xmath70 }",

    "the corresponding ldos is shown in fig.2 for several values of @xmath106 .",
    "assume first that the central dot is detached from the two dots qd1 and qd3 , @xmath107 ( solid line in fig.2 ) .",
    "the peak at the fermi level in @xmath102 reveals then the usual kondo phenomenon in a single dot , which leads to the kondo anomaly in transport through the dot ( to be discussed later ) .",
    "if now one additional and noninteracting dot is attached to the kondo dot _ via _ a hopping term , the shape of the kondo peak is changed due to the interference effects ( not shown in fig.2 ) . as it has been shown by wu _",
    "et al _ @xcite , the dos can be then decomposed into a breit - wigner and a fano line shape .",
    "assume now that another non - interacting dot has been connected to the kondo dot , as in the case shown in fig.1 .",
    "let the bare levels of the side - coupled dots are fixed at @xmath2 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "when the interdot coupling strength @xmath109 is nonzero , two additional asymmetric satellite peaks emerge in ldos @xmath102 .",
    "as shown in fig.2 , these peaks move away from the central peak as @xmath109 increases . at the same time , the widths of the satellite peaks increase , while the central peak becomes narrower .    in fig.3",
    "the ldos for the dot qd2 is shown for different energy levels of the side - coupled dots , while coupling of these dots to the central dot is fixed , @xmath101 .",
    "it has been assumed there that the energy levels of the dots qd1 and qd3 are located symmetrically with respect to the fermi level at equilibrium , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . for a nonzero @xmath112 ,",
    "the ldos reveals three well defined peaks .",
    "the central peak ( the main kondo peak ) is located at the fermi level of the leads , while the other two satellite peaks are roughly at @xmath113 .",
    "when @xmath114 , position of these satellite peaks is only weakly dependent on @xmath112 . between the maxima ,",
    "the ldos goes to zero at @xmath115 .",
    "the width of central peak becomes narrower and narrower with decreasing @xmath112 , and the peak has almost @xmath116-like shape for very small values of @xmath112 , @xmath117 .",
    "this means that the kondo state associated with this maximum becomes then more and more localized at the fermi level . in analogy to the dicke effect , which is well known in optics , the narrow central peak in ldos may be considered as a long - lived ( _ subradiant _ ) state , whereas the other two peaks as corresponding to short - lived ( _ superradiant _ ) states .",
    "it is interesting to note that one can observe transition from _ subradiant _ to _ superradiant _ mode ( and _ vice versa _ ) by tuning separation of the side - coupled dots levels from the fermi level , e.g. by gate voltages .",
    "thus , a particular state , for example the one at the fermi level , is _",
    "subradiant_-like for small values of @xmath112 ( @xmath117 ) , and _",
    "superradiant_-like for large values of @xmath112 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "when the energy levels of the side - coupled dots coincide with the fermi level , @xmath119 , the kondo peak ( central peak ) in ldos is suppressed and disappears .    )",
    ".,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    for large values of the side dots level separation ( @xmath118 ) , the satellite peaks are narrow , while the central peak is then relatively broad .",
    "this situation is qualitatively similar to that observed in ref .",
    "however , the width of the central peak is now a complex non - monotonic function of the level separation @xmath112 ( due to self - consistent parameters @xmath54 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "the width of the peak increases for small values of @xmath112 achieving a maximum and then decreases very slowly ( even for large values of @xmath112 ) .",
    "moreover , in the nonlinear response regime , when a nonzero bias voltage is applied to the system , the width of the central peak is further suppressed , especially for large @xmath112 .",
    "position of the maximum moves to smaller values of @xmath112 as bias voltage increases .",
    "another new feature is a broad range of very small ldos between the central maximum and the satellite peaks for larger values of @xmath112 .    to summarize this section",
    "we conclude that the width of the kondo peak in ldos can be changed by tuning both the level position of side dots and the inter dot coupling strength .",
    "such systems give us an opportunity to study cross - over from the _ subradiant _ to _ superradiant _ mode , and _",

    "we show differential conductance as a function of the applied voltage for the case when the dot qd1 is coupled to the kondo dot with a constant strength , @xmath122 , while the coupling strength of the dot qd3 is gradually switched on . for comparison",
    "we have also shown there the curve for the kondo dot totally decoupled from both side dots , @xmath95 . owing to the kondo resonance , the unitary limit of the conductance is then reached for zero bias limit .",
    "this is well know behavior of transport through a single kondo dot .",
    "let us now turn on the coupling of the kondo dot to one of the side dots , say to the dot qd1 .",
    "the zero bias anomaly becomes then suppressed as a consequence of the interplay between the fano interference and the kondo effect @xcite . for a sufficiently large @xmath123 , the zero bias anomaly may even disappear .",
    "however , the situation becomes more complex when the second side dot ( qd3 ) is attached to the kondo dot and starts to play a role in transport . with increasing coupling strength @xmath124 of the dot qd3 to the dot qd2 , one observes revival of the zero bias anomaly peak , which for @xmath125 reaches unitary limit for zero bias .",
    "interplay of the dicke and kondo resonances leads , however , to a faster decrease of the conductance at small voltages , and slower at higher voltages . as a consequence , a tail in the conductance survives at higher voltages , where the conductance of the kondo dot detached from the side dots already disappears .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the narrowing of the central kondo peak in ldos and the occurrence of two satellite peaks ( see discussion in the previous subsection ) .",
    "this behavior is clearly seen in fig .",
    "5 , where the bias dependence of the differential conductance is shown for several values of the inter - dot coupling parameters , @xmath126 .",
    "the zero bias conductance in such a symmetrical case does not depend on the value of @xmath109 , which reflects the ldos behavior ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "similar behavior also occurs when the coupling strength @xmath106 are fixed while the level separation of the side - coupled dots is changed ( see fig.6 ) . for large values of @xmath112",
    "the conductance decreases with increasing bias monotonically .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath112 the differential conductance is a nonmonotonic function of the applied bias voltage .",
    "it falls down rapidly in the region of small bias voltages achieving a minimum value at some voltage , and then rises again .",
    "these features are quite reasonable because the satellite peaks move away from the central peak as @xmath112 increases .",
    "thus , for large values of @xmath112 the satellite peaks do not contribute to electronic transport .",
    "for a small @xmath112 , however , the satellite peaks enter the transport window and contribute to current , leading to an increase in the conductance above a certain bias voltage .",
    "it is worth to note , that the zero bias anomaly for @xmath119 is totally suppressed and the differential conductance slowly rises as the bias voltage is applied .",
    "this suppression is a consequence of the suppression of the kondo peak in dos due to the interplay of the dicke and kondo resonances .    )",
    ".,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      the only nonzero contribution to the noise in electronic transport at zero temperature , @xmath47 , is the shot noise , while the thermal noise is then totally suppressed .",
    "the quadratic form of the mfa hamiltonian allows us to express the zero frequency shot noise in the form , @xmath127.\\ ] ] deviation of the shot noise @xmath128 from the poisson value , @xmath129 , is usually characterized by the fano factor @xmath130 , which for the poissonian noise is exactly equal to 1 .    in fig .",
    "7 , the bias dependence of the fano factor is displayed for different interdot coupling parameters @xmath124 , whereas the parameter @xmath123 is fixed at @xmath131 . for the t - shape geometry",
    "( one side dot is decoupled from the central dot qd2 , @xmath132 ) , the fano interference plays a significant role in transport processes , and  as discussed above  leads to suppression of the zero bias anomaly below the unitary limit .",
    "this is also manifested in the shot noise characteristics .",
    "the zero bias limit of the fano factor is larger than zero , and this behavior is a result of the weakening of the kondo peak at the fermi level due to the fano interference .",
    "with increasing @xmath123 , but still having @xmath132 , the fano interference outweighs the kondo effect and the fano factor @xmath133 tends to unitary limit ( shot noise tends to the poissonian value ) .",
    "when coupling of the dot qd3 to the dot qd2 is turned on , the zero bias fano factor drops and finally for a symmetric system , @xmath134 , reaches zero as for the single quantum dot . as a result , the system is ideally transparent for electrons at the fermi energy @xmath135 ( at the equilibrium ) .",
    "( measured in the units of @xmath91).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    figure 8 shows the fano factor as a function of the applied voltage for various inter - dot couplings , @xmath126 . applied bias voltage partially suppresses the kondo effect , which results in the growth of the fano factor .",
    "this growth is faster for smaller values of @xmath109 .    , @xmath111 , and for @xmath136.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]     for different values of @xmath112 ; @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",

    "one can then note a sudden increase of the fano factor for a small value of the level separation , @xmath138 , while for @xmath139 the fano factor remains small over a wider range of the bias voltage before it grows to the poisson limit .    in fig.10 the fano factor @xmath133",
    "is plotted as a function of @xmath109 for a fixed bias voltage @xmath137 , and for different positions of the side - coupled dots levels ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 ) .",
    "when the bare levels of side - coupled dots are in the transport window , the fano factor is then significantly affected by the interdot coupling . for a very small value of @xmath112",
    ", the fano factor grows rapidly from a small value at zero interdot coupling to its maximum values , and then falls down to half of the poissonian value at sufficiently strong couplings .",
    "it is worth to note that the fano factor does not reach the poissonian limit for any @xmath112 , except the case of @xmath119 . in turn , for @xmath140 the fano factor @xmath133 is less sensitive to the interdot coupling strength .",
