    "the above three contributions have physically distinct origins ; the first involves the direct effect of electromagnetism on the @xmath153 decay amplitude , the second arises from final state scattering in which electromagnetism induces leakage from @xmath154 to @xmath155 , and the third is due to the shift in two - pion phase space produced by the electromagnetic mass shift  @xcite .",
    "despite the presence of many unknown finite counterterms , it is possible to apply the numerical results of eq .",

    "since the central values of the amplitudes have @xmath162 , the electromagnetic loop corrections are seen to produce @xmath20 effects , although the uncertainties of the counterterm values overwhelms the numerical result .",
    "a phenomenological analysis  @xcite based on @xmath163-wave pion - pion scattering lengths and forward dispersion relations gives @xmath164 .",
    "yet an isospin analysis of @xmath6 decays yields @xmath165 .",
    "presumably this difference of nearly @xmath166 can be reconciled by subtracting em effects from the @xmath6 decays .",

    "naive estimates allow the possibility that this shift could be much larger , perhaps even being a major portion of @xmath12 .",
    "our previous work at the leading order in the chiral expansion yielded a small effect .",
    "one motivation of the present calculation was to see if the next order effects upset this conclusion .",
    "our estimates show that the natural size of the shift in @xmath12 remains at the few percent level .",
    "this has been a complicated calculation with many different lagrangians , describing different aspects of electromagnetic physics , required to obtain the full effect .",
    "these include explicit photon loops , mass shifts in the mesons propagating in loops and the short - distance electroweak interaction .",
    "the chiral power counting was crucial in sorting out which effects must be included for a consistent calculation .",
    "the resulting structure is universal and model independent .",
    "however , it is a prelude to more fully predictive applications , as there remain unknown low energy constants which are not predicted by chiral symmetry alone .",
    "different models can be used to estimate the renormalized constants which appear in the chiral lagrangians , and these model predictions can then be readily translated into the physical amplitudes through the use of our calculation . in a following publication ,",
