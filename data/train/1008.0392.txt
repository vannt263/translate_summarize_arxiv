    "the high densities and low temperatures of the intracluster medium ( hereafter icm ) in the cores of some galaxy clusters imply massive amounts of gas cooling radiatively out of the icm .",
    "early studies ( see review by fabian 1994 ) suggested that cooling flows on the order of 1001000 m@xmath1  yr@xmath2 should be depositing massive amounts of cold gas onto the brightest cluster galaxy ( hereafter bcg ) in the cluster core . the lack of evidence for such large amounts of cold molecular gas or young stars is often referred to as the `` cooling flow problem '' .",
    "more recent studies suggest that the cooling region is much smaller than previously thought ( peres et  al .",
    "1998 ) , which implies overall lower estimates on the mass deposition rate .",
    "additionally , it is now generally accepted that some form of heating balances the radiative cooling , leading to cooling flow rates on the order of 110 m@xmath1  yr@xmath2 . mechanical and radiative feedback from agn and starbursts",
    "( e.g. peterson & fabian 2006 , veilleux , cecil & bland - hawthorn 2005 ) , gas sloshing in the cluster core ( e.g. zuhone et  al .  2009 ) , merger shocks ( e.g. randall et  al .  2002 ) and conduction from the surrounding icm ( e.g. voigt & fabian 2004 ) have all been suggested as possible contributors to icm heating .",
    "however , the relative importance of each process remains unclear .",
    "the presence of optical line - emitting nebulae , found primarily in cooling flow clusters , is a clue that cooler ( @xmath3  10@xmath4  k ) gas coexists with the icm and that cooling flows may not be entirely ruled out ( hu et  al .",
    "1985 , heckman et  al .",
    "1989 , crawford et  al .",
    "1999 ; jaffe et  al .",
    "2005 , hatch et  al .",
    "however , while several intriguing ideas have been put forward , the origin of this gas and the mechanism for heating it are , as yet , unknown . while the presence of cool gas could be attributed to the purported cooling flow , one",
    "would then naively expect a relatively symmetric geometry and a strong connection of optical emission lines with x - ray properties . however , this is not generally the case .",
    "crawford et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) investigate a specific scenario , the extended h@xmath0 filament in abell  1795 , and suggest as an explanation a cooling wake , produced by a symmetric cooling flow falling onto the brightest cluster galaxy ( hereafter bcg ) which has a high relative velocity at the center of the cluster .",
    "oegerle & hill ( 2001 ) find that @xmath3 15% of bcgs are moving with a high peculiar velocity , so an asymmetric distribution of warm gas in this fraction of clusters would be relatively straightforward to explain in this context . potentially contributing heating / ionization sources in the filaments include ( i ) the central agn , ( ii ) hot young stellar population outside the cd galaxy nucleus , ( iii ) x - rays from the icm itself , ( iv ) heat conduction from the icm to the colder filaments , ( v ) shocks and turbulent mixing layers , and ( vi ) collisional heating by cosmic rays ( crawford et  al .  2005 ; ferland et  al .",
    "2009 ) .    in star forming regions ,",
    "the presence of ionized hydrogen is a prime indication of the rate and location of star formation . while several cooling flow clusters have been observed to have non - zero star formation rates at their center , based on uv ( hicks & mushotzky 2005 ) and infrared ( odea et  al .",
    "2008 ) observations , it is not immediately clear whether newly formed stars are fully responsible for the flux and morphology of the observed h@xmath0 emission .",
    "indeed , there has been very little work done on the spatial correlation between the star forming and warm components in cooling flow cluster centers .",
    "what _ has _ become clear from recent studies is that , in general , the measured star formation rate in the bcg is consistently less than the spectroscopically determined x - ray cooling rate for the cluster by a factor of 3 - 10 ( i.e. rafferty et  al .",
    "2006 ; odea et  al .",
    "2008 ) , implying that not all of the cooling gas is turning into stars with a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf .",
    "a major problem standing in the way of an explanation of these filaments is that there are still only a small number of known cases with clearly extended emission beyond the nucleus of the bcg .",
    "this is due to the paucity of narrow - band filters which can be tuned to cosmological redshifts .",
    "attempts have been made to quantify the fraction of bcgs which exhibit h@xmath0 emission using the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g. edwards et  al .",
    "however , spectroscopic studies usually only tell us about the very center of the bcg , which can be bright in h@xmath0 if an agn is present .",
    "what is needed is a deep , wide - field , narrow - band survey of clusters of various richness in order to assess the ubiquity , extent , and topology of the warm gas .",
    "some progress has been made towards this end by jaffe et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , using the taurus tunable filter ( ttf ; bland - hawthorn & jones 1998 ) .",
    "the use of a tunable filter allows the observer to tune to a large range in wavelengths with a narrow bandwidth ( @xmath3  10 ) .",
    "the ability to tune the wavelength is particularly useful when observing cooling flow clusters , of which there are very few in the local universe .    in the pilot study leading to this survey paper , mcdonald & veilleux ( 2009 ; hereafter mv09 ) observed abell  1795 in h@xmath0 with the maryland magellan tunable filter ( hereafter mmtf ; veilleux et  al .",
    "2010 ) in h@xmath0 .",
    "the well - known southeast filament which extends @xmath3  50 kpc from the bcg was found to be , in fact , two separate thin strands .",
    "these thin filaments were resolved into chains of point sources in the far - uv with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys solar blind channel .",
    "we suggested that these strands of h@xmath0 were , in fact , a cooling wake produced by the cooling flow falling onto a cd galaxy which is plowing through the center of the cluster .",
    "as the gas cools , it collapses into thinner filaments , eventually leading to star formation which will ionize the gas .",
    "the thinness of the filaments suggests that magnetic fields are likely important to prevent turbulence from erasing them , but this is just speculation without any direct evidence of a strong magnetic field in the filaments .",
    "although it is likely more complicated than this ( we observe higher - than- expected [ n ii]/h@xmath0 ratios , and a slight spatial offset between the uv and h@xmath0 ) , this scenario can explain the general structure of the h@xmath0 complex .    in order to have a more complete picture of the extended h@xmath0 emission in galaxy clusters ,",
    "we have undertaken a survey of 23 clusters with a wide variety of properties using the mmtf . in the following section we describe our sample selection , as well as the acquisition and analysis of the data . in  3 , we present the results of the analysis and in  4 discuss the various implications of these results .",
    "finally , in  5 we present a summary of the results . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume the following cosmological values : h@xmath5 = 73 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath6 = 0.27 , @xmath7 = 0.73 .",
    "in order to have a more complete picture of cool core clusters , we have undertaken a multi - wavelength survey of 23 cooling flow clusters . from an initial sample size of 232 clusters , which cover 2 orders of magnitude in dm / dt and with x - ray temperatures ranging from 1 - 12 kev , ( full sample from white et  al .",
    "1997 ) we enforced the following cuts : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these cuts ensured that ( 1 ) the cluster was visible with magellan , ( 2 ) the appropriate blocking filters were available to observe redshifted h@xmath0 , and ( 3 ) the cluster angular size did not exceed that of mmtf ( @xmath330 ) .",
    "these two cuts removed a total of 44 and 62 clusters from the full sample , respectively , leaving a total of 126 observable clusters . from this list , we selected 23 clusters to cover the full range of properties , from very rich clusters with high cooling rates ( e.g. , abell 1795 , abell 2029 ) to low - density clusters with little or no cooling flow ( e.g. , ophiuchus , abell 3376 ) .",
    "a summary of these properties for our sample clusters is given in table [ sample ] . as is shown in table [ sample ] ,",
    "the range in classical cooling rates for this sample is from 6.3431 m@xmath1  yr@xmath2 , which means that , while we cover a large range in properties , we are examining only cooling flow clusters .",
    "this selection criteria should produce a higher fraction of line - emitting bcgs compared to an un - biased cluster sample ( see edwards et  al .",
    "2007 ) .    for these 23 clusters",
    ", we have data at h@xmath0 ( mmtf ; 23/23 ) , red continuum ( mmtf ; 23/23 ) , near - ir ( 2mass ; 23/23 ) , uv ( _ galex _ , _ xmm - om _ ; 21/23 ) and x - ray ( _ chandra _ ; 19/23 ) .",

    "there is no obvious correlation between the the galaxy brightness ( or stellar mass , approximately ) and the presence of h@xmath0 filaments , suggesting that the observed filaments are related instead to the x - ray properties of the cluster core .",
    "in the previous sections we have provided several new clues to the origin of the observed h@xmath0 filaments :    * in clusters with filamentary h@xmath0 emission , we tend to see structure in the cooler ( 0.52.0  kev ) x - ray gas . if there is no structure in the x - ray gas , there is typically no accompanying h@xmath0 emission ( figures [ bigfig ] , [ xray - rgb ] ) .",
    "* there is a strong correlation between the h@xmath0 flux in filaments and both the x - ray determined cooling flow rate , dm / dt , and cluster entropy over 3 orders of magnitude ( figure [ uvha_xray ] ) . * the extent of the h@xmath0 filaments never exceeds the cooling radius .",
    "this appears to be a hard limit to the radius of these filaments ( figure [ radii ] ) . *",
    "the metallicity of the x - ray gas coincident with the h@xmath0 filaments is often lower than the non - coincident icm at the same radii .",
    "the on - filament x - ray metallicity is consistent with that measured near the cooling radius or beyond ( figure [ abundances ] ) . *",
    "the temperature and cooling time of the x - ray gas coincident with the h@xmath0 filaments is significantly lower than that of the surrounding icm ( figure [ fils ] ) .",
    "these results suggest a direct link between the hot icm and the warm ionized filaments .",
    "however , before we discuss their implications , we would be remiss if we did not mention the spectacular h@xmath0 filaments detected in the nearby cooling flow cluster , perseus . a great deal of literature",
    "has been devoted to the study of these filaments , which are seen in molecular gas ( salom et  al .",
    "2008 ) , warm ionized hydrogen ( conselice et  al .",
    "2001 ) and x - ray ( fabian et  al .",
    "however , while the observed filaments are indeed impressive , we would argue that they are `` typical '' among what we classify as our type i clusters . in figure [ pera ]",
    "we show the effect of placing perseus a at larger redshift , and simulating a 20-minute exposure using the mmtf under typical observing conditions . by a redshift of 0.06 , which is roughly the mean redshift of our sample ,",

    "these redshifted images look similar in morphology to our detections of filaments in the 7 clusters which we label as type i. additionally , we show in figure  [ uvha_xray ] that perseus a occupies a similar space to the other clusters with filamentary h@xmath0 in temperature , cooling rate and temperature .",
    "the total luminosity in h@xmath0 is significantly higher than in all other clusters , however this is probably again partially due to its proximity : if a filament completely disappears into the background we will choose a smaller aperture and , thus , measure a smaller total luminosity .",
    "0.06 , most of the spectacular filaments have been lost , leaving only a few unresolved structures.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we finish by discussing the results summarized above in the context of several current theories which attempt to explain the presence of the observed h@xmath0 filaments : buoyant radio bubbles , gas sloshing in the central potential , accretion of gas - rich galaxies , filamentary cooling flows , icm conduction and magnetic fields .        in an effort to explain how an agn can deposit energy into the icm and quench cooling ,",
    "much work has been focused on the evolution of bubbles blown in the icm by radio jets ( e.g. reynolds et  al .",
    "2005 , vernaleoet  al .",
    "2007 , revaz et  al .  2008 ) . due to the local density contrast , these bubbles are buoyant and will rise to larger radius , transporting energy from small radii to large .",
    "while rising , the shape of the bubble evolves and can leave behind a trail of cooler gas that morphologically matches the observed h@xmath0 filaments in perseus a ( reynolds et  al .",
    "2005 , revaz et  al .",
    "radio bubbles have been observed in several clusters to date , including some in our sample ( e.g. abell  0780 , abell  2052 ) , which lends further support to this scenario .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the low temperatures seen in the x - ray icm coincident with the h@xmath0 filaments and with the fact that all of the clusters with extended filaments have non - zero 1.4 ghz flux .",
    "some clusters ( e.g. abell  0780 , abell  2052 ) show h@xmath0 emission along the edges of known radio - blown bubbles lending further support to this scenario .",
    "it is unclear exactly how the strong correlation between the h@xmath0 radius and the cooling radius fits in this scenario , although it could be that this relation is tied to the ionization and not to the source of the gas .",
    "the low icm abundance coincident with the h@xmath0 filaments appears to match well with the abundance beyond the cooling radius , but it may also match the core abundance , which previous works ( e.g. , sanders et  al .  2002 , 2007 ) have found to be metal - poor in several nearby clusters .",
    "the gravitational disruption of a cluster core by mergers or interactions with other clusters or galaxies can lead to the icm `` sloshing '' about the central potential , creating cold fronts that have been observed in several clusters to date ( e.g. zuhone et  al .",
    "2009 , johnson et  al .",
    "while this is certainly an important mechanism for heat transport and is very likely ongoing in several clusters with observed cooling fronts , it does not seem to be a plausible general explanation for the presence of warm filaments .",
    "the morphology of the h@xmath0 filaments in our sample tends to be radial , with very few exceptions .",
    "the gas sloshing scenario predicts cool , low - entropy gas along fronts which are aligned perpendicular to the radial direction .",
    "the process of sloshing in the cluster core should also smooth out any abundance gradients , however we detect possible abundance contrasts between the x - ray gas on - filament and off - filament .",
    "finally , the magnitude of the gas sloshing should be dependent on the strength of the merger or disruption event .",
    "however , we see a clear limit to the length of the filaments ( r@xmath30 @xmath31 r@xmath32 ) , which is inconsistent with the sloshing picture .",
    "while the direction of some of the observed filaments seemingly coincides with the location of smaller galaxies ( e.g.  abell  0478 , abell  0496 , abell  0780 ) , it is unlikely that the warm gas has been stripped from these galaxies .",
    "if this were the case , one would expect the filaments to extend all the way to the satellite galaxy , in some cases , which is not seen .",
    "likewise , we would not expect a single galaxy , or small group of galaxies , to have a strong effect on the distribution of the hot x - ray gas .",
    "however , much of the structure seen in h@xmath0 is seen also in the chandra x - ray images .",
    "additionally , the strong correlation between the mass deposition rate and cluster entropy would be unexplained by such a formation method .",
    "a back - of - the - envelope calculation seems to rule out this mechanism as the source of the observed h@xmath0 filaments .",
    "the typical h@xmath0 luminosity that we observe in filaments is @xmath3 5@xmath1710@xmath33 erg s@xmath2 , which corresponds to @xmath3 3.7@xmath1710@xmath34 recombinations per second ( assuming case b recombination ) .",
    "if we assume that the diffuse ionized medium in the stripped galaxy is pure hydrogen and is being stripped from a galaxy like our milky way , and then recombining only once as it cools in the absence of ionizing radiation , this corresponds to @xmath3 950 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 of recombining gas . assuming a total diffuse hii mass of 10@xmath35 m@xmath1 for a typical massive spiral ( lequeux 2005 ) , this implies that all of the stripped gas would recombine in @xmath3 1 myr .",
    "thus , in order to consistently produce warm ionized filaments via gas stripping , the bcg would have to strip the gas disk from a spiral galaxy every few myr , which is unreasonably short , given the typical cluster crossing times of @xmath3 1 gyr .",
    "alternatively , if we invoke an additional ionization source once the gas has been stripped from the galaxy ( e.g. x - ray conduction from the icm ) , a smaller amount of stripped gas could lead to the observed fluxes of h@xmath0 .",
    "we will revisit this issue in much greater detail in subsequent papers .      in this scenario ,",
    "the observed h@xmath0 filaments directly trace the cooling flow ( i.e. cowie et  al .",
    "1980 ; fabian et  al .  1984",
    "; heckman et  al .",
    "the x - ray icm begins to cool dramatically at the cooling radius , while falling inwards at roughly the free - fall speed .",
    "as the gas cools , small density contrasts in the icm grow and thin , high - density filaments form .",
    "once sufficiently cool , the gas in these filaments can be re - ionized via star formation , collisional heating ( e.g. ferland et  al .",
    "2009 ) or drag heating ( e.g. pope et  al .",
    "this scenario is consistent with h@xmath0 filaments extending to r@xmath32 , with the observed correlation between x - ray and h@xmath0 properties and with the low metallicity and high cooling rates found in the x - ray gas coincident with h@xmath0 filaments .",
    "additionally , the fact that we only see h@xmath0 filaments out to a radius where gas can cool in 5 gyr agrees well with observations that the frequency of cool cores beyond a lookback time of 5 gyr is significantly lower than the local universe .",
    "thus , the cooling flow scenario is our preferred formation scenario for the optical filaments .",
    "the thinness of the observed h@xmath0 filaments relative to their extent ( table  a.1 ) is reminiscent of the thin , filamentary structure seen in hydrodynamic simulations of cool gas flows ( e.g.  hattori et  al .",
    "1995 , pope et  al .  2008 ,",
    "ceverino et  al .",
    "figure 3 from ceverino et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) shows long ( @xmath36 50 kpc ) , thin ( @xmath31 10 kpc ) filaments of cold gas which resemble our observations of h@xmath0 filaments . while the physical scales are slightly different , they describe the process which cool ( @xmath31  5@xmath1710@xmath4  k ) filaments embedded in a spherical halo of hot ( @xmath36  3@xmath1710@xmath37  k ) gas may form .",
    "the formation of these cool filaments is used by the authors to explain how star formation proceeds in spiral galaxies at high redshift , but the physical processes should be similar for gas cooling from the hot phase to the cool phase , regardless of whether we are considering gas streaming onto an isolated spiral galaxy or a central cluster galaxy .",
    "in mv09 we argued that the most plausible scenario for the creation of the long , thin filament in abell  1795 was a cooling wake caused by a cooling flow occurring around the moving cd galaxy .",
    "this claim was made based on the observation by oegerle & hill ( 2001 ) that abell  1795 has a significant peculiar velocity relative to the cluster .",
    "however , we find that the second most asymmetric case , abell  0496 , which also has filaments extending only in one direction , has a negligible peculiar velocity . likewise ,",
    "several bcgs with no h@xmath0 emission ( e.g. , abell  2029 , abell  2151 ) or nuclear - only h@xmath0 emission ( e.g. abell  2580 ) have a peculiar velocity as high , or higher , than abell  1795 .",
    "thus , while this may play a role in determining the direction of the filaments , it is not likely the most important factor in their formation .",
    "this scenario makes the prediction that the filament material should be in near free - fall .",
    "the jury is still out on this issue , as several works ( i.e. hatch et  al .",
    "2007 , oonk et  al .  2010 ) argue against radial infall in h@xmath0 filaments , while others ( i.e. lim et  al .",
    "2008 , wilman et  al .",
    "2009 ) argue for it .",
    "thus , a homogenous sample of kinematic measurements is needed to complement this census of the warm and hot medium and provide a strong argument either for or against the radially - infalling cooling flow .",
    "conduction from the x - ray icm is a promising scenario which could provide the energy necessary to ionize the cooling gas .",
    "nipoti & binney ( 2004 ) predict that , if conduction is responsible for ionizing the h@xmath0 filaments , there should be an excess of soft x - rays surrounding the filaments .",
    "this is consistent with our findings that the soft x - ray morphology matches well with the h@xmath0 morphology and that the temperature of the x - ray gas coincident with the warm filaments is significantly cooler than the surrounding icm . in an attempt to address the plausibility of this scenario for ionizing the observed h@xmath0 filaments in our sample",
    ", we turn to a study of thermal conduction in 16 cooling - flow clusters by voigt & fabian ( 2004 ) . of these 16 clusters , there are 5 which overlap with our sample : abell  0478 , abell  0780 , abell  1795 , abell  2029 and sersic  159 - 03 . of the five clusters in this overlapping sample ,",
    "four show very extended , filamentary h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the conductivity inside of the cooling radius for these four clusters ranges from @xmath38  =  0.32.3 , while for the lone overlapping cluster with no h@xmath0 emission , the effective conductivity is @xmath38  =  0.2 ( voigt & fabian , 2004 ) .",
    "estimates of the minimal value required for conduction to to transport heat from the hot icm to cooler regions varies from 0.01 ( churazov et  al .",
    "2001 ) to 0.3 ( narayan & medvedev 2001 ) .",
    "the fact that we observe cooler x - ray gas coincident with the h@xmath0 filaments , coupled with the relatively large conductivity measurements in clusters with filaments ( albeit with a small sample size ) suggests that conductivity may be responsible for much of the energy required to ionize these filaments .",
    "however , future work is needed to expand on the number of clusters with effective conduction measurements and to determine if the energetics of the warm filaments match what we would expect from icm conduction .",
    "given the typically large axial ratio of the h@xmath0 filaments ( length / thickness @xmath3 30 , according to table a.1 ) , magnetic fields likely play a role in the formation of these filaments , in one or more of several ways : ( i ) by channeling the inflow of clumps of gas along field lines , giving them coherent structure ( fabian et  al .",
    "2003 ) , ( ii ) preventing the hot , turbulent icm from shredding the filaments ( hatch et  al .",
    "2007 ) , ( iii ) to help the growth of thermal instabilities , leading to thin high - density filaments ( hattori et  al .  1995 ) , and ( iv ) suppressing conduction of heat from the icm to the cooling gas ( voigt & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "high - resolution x - ray spectra of these clusters could constrain the level of turbulence in the icm ( e.g. , sanders et  al .",
    "these measurements , combined with the observed thinness of the h@xmath0 filaments and mhd models could constrain the strength of the intracluster magnetic field required to sustain such filaments , in a similar manner to loewenstein & fabian ( 1990 ) .",
    "this would be a nice consistency check on the magnetic field strengths derived from rotation measures .",
    "this study represents the highest resolution survey of warm ionized filaments in cooling flow clusters beyond 100 mpc to date .",
    "complex , filamentary morphologies are seen in 8/23 ( 35% ) of our clusters , with slightly extended or nuclear emission seen in additional 7/23 ( 30% ) .",
    "we find a weak correlation between the total h@xmath0 luminosity and the near - uv luminosity from young stars , which suggests that photoionization from young stars may play a role in producing the observed h@xmath0 .",
    "uv imaging of higher spatial resolution is needed to spatially correlate the h@xmath0 and uv emission , and to remove the contribution to the uv luminosity from the agn and/or central starburst .",
    "while the h@xmath0 and x - ray data support the buoyant radio bubble hypothesis as a source of cool gas in some cases , we believe that the cooling flow model does a better job of explaining the properties of the ensemble of clusters .",
    "we observe correlations between the soft x - ray morphology and the h@xmath0 morphology , the x - ray cooling rate and the h@xmath0 luminosity contained in filaments .",
    "we find evidence for a correlation between the x - ray metal abundance of gas coincident with the h@xmath0 filaments and at the cooling radius , however more data are required in order to obtain reliable on - filament abundance measurements .",
    "the maximum radial extent of the h@xmath0 emission and the cooling radius appear to be linked , such that r@xmath30 @xmath31 r@xmath32 , where r@xmath32 is the radius at which the x - ray gas can cool in less than 5  gyr .",
    "this radius appears to be physically motivated , as the choice of timescale agrees well with the lookback time at which cooling flow clusters begin to emerge . additionally , we find that the x - ray gas coincident with observed h@xmath0 filaments is cooling on a much shorter ( @xmath3 20% ) timescale than the surrounding icm .",
    "these results suggest that the h@xmath0 filaments trace the x - ray cooling flow , and that this flow is initiated at the cooling radius .",
    "there does not appear to be a strong correlation between the presence of filaments and the structural properties of the bcg , suggesting that the h@xmath0 filaments are not related to any feedback processes from the central galaxy . based on our results ,",
    "we propose that the gas is cooling out of the x - ray icm in clumps at roughly the cooling radius and collapsing into thin streams as it falls onto the bcg . the observed asymmetry is likely due to the cooling flow being channeled along magnetic field lines . based on the x - ray and h@xmath0 correlations , as well as the high effective conductivity in clusters with h@xmath0 filaments ,",
    "it is likely that this cool gas is conducting heat from the surrounding icm in order to remain ionized .",
    "several questions remain unanswered in this scenario , such as the cooling process for the hot gas below @xmath3 0.5 kev , and the exact ionization mechanism for the warm gas .",

    "regardless of the method of producing this morphology in the x - ray , we note that the h@xmath0 filaments do not extend beyond the cold front in this cluster ( @xmath3 15 kpc ) , despite the fact that the cooling radius is nearly 50 kpc .",
    "wise et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) present a summary of the x - ray and radio properties of this cluster , showing the excellent correlation between the radio jets and the x - ray cavities .",
    "the arcing h@xmath0 filament that we detect north of the bcg appears to be spatially correlated with the radio jet .",
    "the nuv emission for this cluster is very bright , but it is unclear if it is has morphological similarities to the h@xmath0 emission without higher resolution uv imaging . a very bright star to the west of the bcg made the data reduction slightly more complicated for this cluster , leading to a lower s / n in the region with the southern filaments .",
    "an arcing trail of cool gas extends south from the core of this cluster .",
    "this morphology is likely the result of an off - axis encounter with a subcluster ( reiprich et  al .",
    "we detect a curved h@xmath0 filament coincident with the cool x - ray gas , as well as two perpendicular h@xmath0 strands to the west and north of the cluster core .",
    "these previously - undetected filaments have large length - width ratios , suggesting that turblence must be low or the magnetic field strength must be high in this cluster core .",
    "additionally , we find very little evidence for an agn in this cluster , in terms of the radio power , x - ray morphology and hard x - ray flux .",
    "a pair of thin ( @xmath3 100pc ) , intertwined filaments extend south from the cluster core for @xmath3 50 kpc ( mv09 ) .",
    "these filaments appear to be heated by strands of young stars which lie along the full extent of both filaments .",
    "however , the elevated [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratios found in mv09 and the literature suggest that either the star formation is dominated by massive stars , or another ionizing mechanism is also important . these twin filaments are coincident with a giant x - ray filament which is unresolved by chandra",
    ". additionally , this cluster has powerful radio jets which are offset in angle from the filament direction .",
    "the cooling wake hypothesis may be valid in this case , as the bcg appears to have a strong peculiar velocity relative to the cluster ( oegerle & hill 2001 ) .",
    "however , we note that a cooling wake should intuitively have slightly more turbulence than a straight cooling flow , which is inconsistent with the picture of long , thin filaments that we observe .",
    "this cluster is the most massive in our sample and also has the most massive bcg .",
    "however , despite being exceptionally bright at x - ray , nuv and 1.4 ghz , we detect no h@xmath0 emission . a clue as to why this may be lies in the unsharp mask image of the x - ray gas .",
    "unlike most other massive clusters , abell 2029 is quite symmetric with no signs of any structure in the x - ray image .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray structure which we observe in all h@xmath0-bright clusters is necessary to produce the filamentary h@xmath0 emission .",
    "this provides yet another link between the h@xmath0 filaments and the cooling x - ray gas and , at the same time , offers a counter - argument to the idea of buoyant radio bubbles being responsible for the emission .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission surrounding the bcg in this cluster is coincident with radio - blown bubbles in the central region of the cluster .",
    "these bubbles to the north and south of the cluster core are filled with radio emission , which likely originated from the agn within the bcg ( blanton et  al .",
    "since the h@xmath0 emission is seen primarily along the edges of the northern bubble , we suspect that shocks may be responsible for the heating in this case .",
    "the very low nuv / h@xmath0 ratio seen in figure [ uvha ] further supports this hypothesis .",
    "as this cluster is more strongly influenced by the agn than any other cluster in our sample , it is an outlier in some of our plots . as an example , in figure [ abundances ] abell 2052 is represented by the point with the lowest on - filament metal abundance .",
    "this abundance measurement is most consistent with the core abundance , not the abundance at the cooling radius .",
    "thus it is possible that our simple picture of the h@xmath0 filaments being tied to the cooling flow may not apply to this cluster .",
    "the core of this cluster contains two peaks , only one of which is reproduced in h@xmath0 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission extends for a short distance to the west , coincident with an extended arm in the x - ray image ( choi et  al .",
    "the radio emission from this cluster extends north , perpendicular to the direction of h@xmath0 emission , suggesting that the radio jets are not playing a role in the heating .",
    "the optical emission in this cluster has been observed by jaffe et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) and more recently by oonk et  al .",
    "both authors find molecular gas which traces the ionized gas out to 20 kpc .",
    "we are able to detect h@xmath0 to 35 kpc , where the surface brightness blends into the background .",
    "it is likely that a deeper exposure would detect the ionized gas out to the cooling radius of @xmath3 60 kpc .",
    "there is no evidence for an agn in the core of this cluster , despite the fact that it has some of the most extended and complex filaments .",
    "this suggests that the phenomenon of warm ionized filaments in clusters is likely independent of the presence of an agn ."
