    "it is observationally well - established that about half of accurately localized gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) do not produce a detectable optical afterglow @xcite , while most of them ( @xmath11 ) have an x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "statistical studies have shown that the optical searches of these events , known variously as `` dark grbs '' , `` failed optical afterglows '' ( foa ) , or `` gamma - ray bursts hiding an optical source - transient '' ( ghost ) , have been carried out to magnitude limits fainter on average than the known sample of optical afterglows ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "some of these grbs could be intrinsically faint events , but this fraction can not be very high , because the majority of dark grbs shows the presence of an x - ray afterglow similar to that observed in grbs with optical afterglows @xcite .",
    "thus dark bursts could constitute a distinct class of events and not only be the result of an inadequate optical search , but it is unclear whether this observational property derives from a single origin or it is a combination of different causes .    if the progenitors of long - duration grbs are massive stars @xcite , as current evidence suggests ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) , extinction of optical flux by dusty star - forming regions is likely to occur for a substantial fraction of events ( _ the obscuration scenario _ ) .",
    "another possibility is that dark grbs are located at redshift @xmath125 , with the optical flux being absorbed by the intervening ly@xmath13 forest clouds ( _ the high - redshift scenario _ ) .",
    "dark bursts which can be localized to arcsecond accuracy , through a detection of either their x - ray or radio afterglow , are of particular interest .",
    "the first and best - studied example was grb970828 for which prompt , deep searches down to r@xmath1424.5 failed to detect an optical afterglow @xcite despite it was localized within a region of only 10  radius by the rosat satellite @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently showed how the detection of a short - lived radio transient for grb 970828 allowed them to identify the probable host galaxy and to infer its properties ( redshift , luminosity and morphology ) .",
    "in addition , they used estimates of the column density of absorbing gas from x - ray data , and lower limits on the rest frame extinction ( a@xmath15 ) to quantify the amount of obscuration towards the grb .    given the extreme luminosity of grbs and their probable association with massive stars , it is expected that some fraction of events will be located beyond @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these would be probably classified as dark bursts because the uv light , which is strongly attenuated by absorption in the ly@xmath10 forest , is redshifted into the optical band .",
    "fruchter ( 1999 ) first suggested such an explanation for the extreme red color of the optical / nir emission for grb980329 , although an alternative explanation based on h@xmath17 absorption in the grb environment would imply a somewhat lower redshift @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite",
    "derive a photometric redshift @xmath18 .",
    "we note that the three redshifts determined or suggested so far for dark grbs ( @xmath19 , grb970828 , @xcite;@xmath20 , grb990506 , @xcite ; @xmath21 , grb000214 , @xcite ) are in the range of those measured for most bright optical afterglows , but whether this applies to the majority of these events is still to be assessed . particularly interesting in this respect",
    "is the case of the so - called x - ray flashes or x - ray rich grbs discovered by _ bepposax_@xcite . in most of these events",
    "no optical counterpart has been found .",
    "the only tentative association claimed as yet is for the event of oct.30 , 2001 , where a candidate host galaxy of magnitude v@xmath22 has been found in the direction of the afterglow @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the probability that this object is a foreground galaxy is not negligible ( @xmath23 , see e.g. eq.[eq : p2 ] in sect.2.3 ) . the _ high - redshift scenario",
    "_ would naturally explain both the absence of optical counterpart and the high - energy spectrum , because the peak of the gamma - ray spectrum would be redshifted into the x - ray band .",
    "if we are to use dark bursts to study obscured star formation in the universe @xcite , we must first understand the source of the extinction .",
    "for those afterglows which are not at @xmath16 it is important to establish whether they are dark because of a dense circumburst medium @xcite , or their optical emission is extinguished by line - of - sight absorption from the medium of the host galaxy .",
    "we can use the properties of the afterglow , its location within the host galaxy , and the properties of the host galaxy itself to address this question . in this paper , we report observations of the burst grb  which was discovered and localized by _",
    "bepposax_. a _ chandra _ observation of the _ bepposax _ error box enabled us to localize the likely host galaxy of the event and to identify a short - lived radio - transient , further refining the position to sub - arcsec accuracy .",

    "we show that this scenario is consistent with the properties of the x - ray absorption .    to keep the gas in a low - ionized stage at a distance of the order of few pc , a density @xmath156@xmath8 is required .",
    "in fact , the recombination time scale @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the electron temperature . in the case of iron , @xmath159 ( _ i.e. _ @xcite ; hereafter , given a quantity @xmath160 , we define @xmath161 ) .",
    "the typical temperature is expected to be in the range @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently high density , recombination is effective in keeping the gas close to ionization equilibrium over timescales @xmath163 ,",
    "_ i.e. _ , during the afterglow phase .",
    "the ionization parameter is then @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the luminosity of the x - ray afterglow in the rest frame energy range 0.013 - 100 kev .",
    "for @xmath166 the medium is then in the neutral phase for distances @xmath167 , as required .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this medium should be clumpy .",
    "the size of each clump has to be @xmath168 cm , and the fraction of volume occupied by this medium ( _ i.e. _ , the filling factor ) @xmath169 .",
    "finally we note that the size of a clump is much smaller than the zone of the fireball visible at the time of the observation , @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the lorentz factor of the fireball in the afterglow phase .",
    "we therefore require that most of the source is covered by these clouds , _",
    "i.e. _ , that the covering fraction @xmath172 .",
    "this condition is satisfied when @xmath173 cm .",
    "the total mass contained in these clouds is @xmath174 .",
    "it is well known from observations and models @xcite , that the medium in star  forming molecular clouds is clumpy , with dense clouds or filaments embedded in a much less dense intercloud medium .",
    "the largest densities are of the order of @xmath175 @xmath8 @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ lower than required .",
    "however , both observations and modeling are limited in resolution to structures of size @xmath176 cm and would then miss smaller and higher density fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the total mass of the x - ray absorbing clouds is a tiny fraction ( @xmath177 ) of the mass of a gmc ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "_ prima facie _ those structures could then be the tail in the power spectrum of density fluctuations in star forming regions .",
    "interestingly , lamb ( 2001 ) has also stressed the role of a _ dusty _ clumpy medium in gmc with regard to optical properties of grbs .",
    "a more detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is worth noting that the density of this medium is similar to that of the gas responsible for iron features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this gas lies much closer to the burst and is therefore highly ionized .",
    "interestingly , in the afterglow of grb000210 , we find a very marginal evidence of a recombination edge by h - like fe atoms ( at a confidence level of @xmath179 ) .",
    "the rest - frame energy of this feature is at 9.28 kev , corresponding , at @xmath146=0.85 , to e=5 kev , where _ bepposax _ data show some residual ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xspettro ] ) .",
    "the @xmath180 kev , is similar to that observed in grb991216 @xcite and in the other dark grb970828 @xcite .",
    "this feature is the result of electron recombination on h - like fe atoms and should be accompanied by a k@xmath13 line at 6.9 kev with a similar intensity @xcite . within the errors ,",
    "the upper limit @xmath181 kev to the latter line is consistent with this prediction .",
    "we now discuss the hypothesis that the absorption does not take place in the circumburst environment of the grb , but in the ism of the host galaxy .",
    "we find that this scenario can easily account for the properties of this burst .",
    "in fact , it immediately explains the absence of ionization features in the x - ray absorber and a dust - to - gas ratio consistent with that in our galaxy .",
    "the typical column density through a gmc is about @xmath182 @xmath6 @xcite , and therefore even a single gmc in the line of sight could provide the necessary absorption both in the optical and in x - rays .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with the location of the grb , which lies within @xmath183 kpc from the center of the galaxy .",
    "could non - local ism absorption by the host galaxy be the unique origin of the whole population of dark grbs ?",
    "let us first assume that grbs occur in the disk of a galaxy similar to ours at a typical distance of 10 kpc from the center .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the _ visible _ properties of grb host galaxies and the distribution of grb offsets with respect to the host centre @xcite .",
    "the line - of - sight column density of interstellar hydrogen gas measured from our location in the galaxy ( 10 kpc from the center ) is consistent with that required to make a grb dark ( @xmath184@xmath6 ) in a belt of about @xmath185 along the plane of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus , of the entire population of grbs occurring in the disk of galaxies randomly oriented in the sky , only @xmath186 would be dark , much below the observed fraction of @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , while this hypothesis can account for a fraction of dark grb s , including this one , in order to make up the entire population of dark events , grb host galaxies should contain quantities of dust and gas , associated with _",
    "obscured _ star - forming regions , much larger than a typical galaxy like ours .",
    "finally , given the modest _ a posteriori _ probability , we have to consider the possibility that the association of grb000210 with the galaxy is coincidental , and that this grb is located at @xmath9 . in this case",
    "the x - ray absorber of grb000210 is thicker and it can also be much more ionized .",
    "for example , at @xmath146=5 , @xmath188 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the data are consistent with an absorber from neutral to highly ionized . in particular we have satisfactorily fitted the data either with a neutral absorber ( @xmath189 ) , that requires @xmath190 @xmath6 , or an ionized absorber ( @xmath191 ) , that gives @xmath192 @xmath6",
    ". such values of column densities are much higher than those observed in x - ray afterglows of grbs with optical transients ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of multi - wavelength observations of grb000210 .",
    "this event was the brightest ever observed in @xmath0-rays in the _ bepposax _ grbm and wfc .",
    "nonetheless , no optical counterpart was found down to a limit of @xmath193 .",
    "grb000210 is therefore one of the events classified as dark grbs , a class that makes up @xmath194 of all grbs .",
    "it is still unclear whether this class derives from a single origin or it is due to a combination of different causes",
    ". some of these grbs could be intrinsically faint events , but this fraction can not be very high , because the majority of dark grbs shows the presence of an x - ray afterglow similar to that observed in grbs with optical afterglows @xcite .",
    "the most compelling hypotheses to explain the origin of dark bursts involve absorption , occurring either in the local environment of the grb ( circumburst or interstellar ) , or as ly@xmath13 forest absorption for those bursts which have @xmath195 .    as in the majority of bursts ,",
    "grb  had an x - ray afterglow which was observed with _",
    "bepposax _ and _ chandra_. the temporal behavior is well described by a power law , with a decay index @xmath196 , similar to that observed in several other events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we did not find evidence for breaks in the light curve .",
    "the spectral index of the power law is also typical ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "thanks to the arcsecond localization provided by _ chandra _",
    "we identified the likely host galaxy of this burst , determined its redshift ( @xmath146=0.846 ) and detected a radio afterglow .",
    "the properties of the x - ray afterglow allowed us to determine the amount of dust obscuration required to make the optical afterglow undetectable ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum shows significant evidence of absorption by neutral gas ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "however , we do not find evidence of a partially ionized absorber expected if the absorption takes place in a giant molecular cloud , as recently suggested to explain the properties of the dark grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that , if the gas is local to the grb , it has to be condensed in dense ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) clouds .",
    "we propose that these clouds represent the small - scale high - density fluctuations of the clumpy medium of star - forming gmcs .    both the amount of dust required to extinguish the optical flux and the dust - to - gas ratio are consistent with those observed across the plane of our galaxy .",
    "we can not therefore exclude that the absorption takes place in the line - of - sight through the interstellar medium of the host , rather than being produced by a gmc embedding the burst .",
    "this hypothesis is also consistent with the location of grb000210 with respect to the center of the likely host galaxy . to explain the whole population of dark grb",
    "this hypothesis would require that host galaxies of grbs should be characterized by quantities of dust and gas much larger than typical , arguing again for a physical connection between grbs and star forming regions .    finally , we discussed the possibility that the galaxy is unrelated to grb  and that it is a dark burst because it lies at @xmath9 . in this case",
    "the x - ray absorbing medium should be substantially thicker than that observed in grbs with optical afterglows .",
    "assuming that grb000210 is a typical representative of a population of events at high redshift , then these grb s are embedded in a much denser environment than that of closer events .",
    "whichever of the explanations apply , it is clear that dark grbs provide a powerful tool to probe their formation sites and possibly to explore the process of star formation in the universe .",
    "we have at hand several observational tools to pursue this investigation .",
    "by increasing the number of arcsecond locations by radio , x - ray and far - infrared observations we can build up a sample of host galaxies of dark grbs and study their distances and physical properties .",
    "the origin of the absorption in x - rays and optical can be addressed by broad band spectra and modeling , providing information on the dust and gas content of the absorbing structures .",
    "x - ray measurements are particularly promising in this respect for several reasons .",
    "first , x - rays do not suffer from absorption , in fact roughly the same number of dark grb and grbs with optical afterglows have an x - ray afterglow .",
    "detection of x - ray lines can thus provide a direct measurement of the redshift .",
    "a comparative study of the x - ray properties of these two classes should also underline differences that can be linked to their origin , like the brightness of x - ray afterglows and the amount of x - ray absorption .",
    "finally , measurements of variability of the x - ray absorbing gas would provide strong support to the _ local absorption _ scenario .",
    "there are several mechanisms that can produce such a variability . the hard photon flux from the grb and its afterglow will ionize the circumburst gas on short time scales , thus decreasing the effective optical depth with time @xcite .",
    "the detection of a transient iron edge in grb990705 @xcite and the decrease of the column density from the prompt to the afterglow phases in grb980329 @xcite and grb010222 @xcite are both consistent with this scenario .",
    "the variable size of the observable fireball that increases with the inverse of the bulk lorentz factor can also produce variations of the column density , if the medium surrounding the source is not homogeneous .",
    "in this regard , two x - ray afterglows show some , admittedly marginal , evidence of variability of @xmath199 @xcite . in conclusion",
    ", the future of the investigations of _ dark _ grbs looks particularly bright .",
