    "star formation drives the frc .",
    "young massive stars produce ultraviolet ( uv ) light , which is easily absorbed by dust grains .",
    "the dust reradiates in the fir , producing a linear correlation between star formation rate and the fir luminosity , if the dust is optically thick to the uv light .",
    "the non - thermal ghz radio continuum emission observed from star - forming galaxies is synchrotron radiation from cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons and positrons , believed to be accelerated in supernova ( sn ) remnants .",
    "since sne mainly occur in young stellar populations , this means that star formation is directly linked to normal ( non - active galactic nucleus ) radio emission ( reviewed in @xcite ) .    in this paper , we model the frc , over its range in physical parameters from normal star - forming galaxies to the densest and most luminous starbursts .",
    "our motivation is that the normalization and linearity of the frc has strong implications for the physical properties of star - forming galaxies and the crs they contain .",
    "for example , we can use the radio emission to estimate the energy injection rate and equilibrium energy density of both cr electrons and protons .",
    "this is important because the cr pressure is known to be dynamically important in the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and possibly starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can use the inferred cr proton energy density to calculate the flux of gamma - rays from pion production in the galaxies host interstellar medium ( ism ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the radio emission also constrains the magnetic field strength in galaxies on the frc @xcite .",
    "finding the causes of the linearity and span of the frc is the other main purpose of this paper .",
    "the frc is affected by the density of crs and the environment they propagate through . for the milky way ,",
    "the propagation of crs has been well studied , both observationally and theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , given the vast range of environments in star - forming galaxies , it is not clear that our knowledge of cr propagation in the galaxy can be extrapolated across the entire frc .",
    "therefore , one aspect of our task in explaining the frc is determining the extent to which the properties of cr injection , such as the initial spectral slope and proton - to - electron ratio , and cr propagation , such as the rate of escape by diffusion , can apply to all star - forming galaxies .",
    "the diversity of star - forming galaxies on the frc and the tightness of the correlation may imply a deeper , simpler principle at work . in the calorimeter theory",
    "first proposed in @xcite , the cr electrons lose all of their energy before escaping galaxies , with most of the energy radiated as synchrotron radio emission .",
    "thus , galaxies are _ electron calorimeters _ , with the energy in cr electrons being converted into an observable form .",
    "calorimetry also requires that galaxies on the frc are optically thick to uv light from young stars , which is reradiated in the fir .",
    "these galaxies would therefore also have to be _",
    "uv calorimeters_. if both electron calorimetry and uv calorimetry hold , and if synchrotron is the main energy loss mechanism , then the ratio of fir to radio emission is simply the ratio of total starlight produced to the total energy supplied to cr electrons , which is naively expected to be a constant fraction of the energy from sne , accounting for the frc .",
    "calorimeter theory has been questioned , however , both in its assumptions and its implications .",
    "for example , the assumption that all normal galaxies are optically thick to uv light is probably false : the observed uv luminosity of normal star - forming galaxies is comparable to the observed fir luminosity at low overall luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nor is electron calorimetry believed to hold in the milky way ( and presumably similar galaxies ) ,",
    "since the inferred diffusive escape time is shorter than the typical estimated synchrotron cooling time ( see equations  [ eqn : standardcrlife ] and  [ eqn : standardb ] later in this paper ; or , e.g. , @xcite ) .    even in cases when calorimetry holds , the implications of standard calorimeter theory may conflict with observations .",
    "a long - standing problem with the predictions of calorimetry has been the radio spectral indices of star - forming galaxies .",
    "if electron calorimetry holds , then the synchrotron cooling timescale is much less than the escape timescale .",
    "the electron population will then be strongly cooled with a steep spectrum . for an initial _ injection _ spectrum of @xmath5 where @xmath6 and a final synchrotron - cooled _ steady - state _",
    "spectrum @xmath7 , this would imply a synchrotron spectrum of @xmath8 with a spectral index of @xmath9 .",
    "the observed spectral indices are @xmath10 for normal galaxies , suggesting that , contrary to calorimeter theory , electrons escape before losing their energy .",
    "@xcite consider a modified calorimeter model for normal galaxies that includes escape comparable to cooling losses , and @xcite suggest that sn remnants in the galaxies can flatten the observed radio spectrum .",
    "more drastically , several non - calorimeter theories have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , often involving a `` conspiracy '' to maintain the tightness of the frc .",
    "a potential pitfall of non - calorimeter models stems from the enormous dynamic range in physical properties for galaxies on the frc .",
    "for example , inverse compton cooling alone is very quick in starbursts , implying that electrons can not escape from these galaxies before losing most of their energy @xcite .",
    "typical explanations of the frc leave out two underappreciated but important effects : proton losses and non - synchrotron cooling . models of individual starbursts , which have gas densities @xmath11 times higher than the milky way , predict that cr protons lose most of their energy to pion creation as they interact with the ism . when a cr proton collides with a proton in the ism , it produces a pion , either charged ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) , or uncharged ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "neutral pions decay into gamma rays , so that pion losses should act as a source of gamma - ray luminosity in starbursts .",
    "charged pions ultimately decay into neutrinos ( which may eventually be observed with neutrino telescopes ) , as well as secondary electrons and positrons .",
    "therefore , dense starburst galaxies are expected to be _ proton calorimeters _ :",
    "essentially all the injected energy in cr protons ends up converted to gamma rays , neutrinos , and secondary electrons and positrons .",
    "proton calorimetry would also imply that , unlike the milky way , secondary electrons and positrons may dominate over primary electrons and positrons , depending on the ratio of injected protons to electrons ( @xcite ; secondary electrons and positrons are found to be more abundant than primary electrons in starbursts by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "because secondary electrons and positrons radiate synchrotron , their presence poses a problem for any explanation of the frc that requires the cr electron density to be directly proportional to the star formation rate , including both standard calorimeter theory and the theory of @xcite",
    ".    on the other hand , bremsstrahlung , ionization , and ic may all be more important in starburst galaxies .",
    "@xcite point out that cooling by bremsstrahlung and ionization tends to flatten the radio spectra , thus saving calorimeter theory from the spectral index argument , at least for starbursts .",
    "however , the energy cr electrons lose to bremsstrahlung , ionization , and ic can not go into synchrotron radio emission , an obstacle for any theory that assumes radio emission is directly proportional to the injected power of primary cr electrons . therefore , even electron calorimetry and uv calorimetry are not enough to guarantee a linear frc .",
    "we address these issues with one - zone numerical models of crs in star - forming galaxies .",
    "these models include cr escape as well as the main cooling processes and secondary production , a combination that has not to our knowledge been done over the entire span of the frc .",
    "crs in individual galaxies have been studied with similar one - zone models that fit the emission across the electromagnetic spectrum ( e.g. , arp 220 in @xcite ; m82 in @xcite ) , but in this paper our focus is on the frc itself and not any individual galaxy .",
    "our one - zone approach allows us to efficiently parameterize unknown quantities like the magnetic field strength , and to try a large number of scenarios .",
    "the primary independent variable in our calculations is the gas surface density @xmath15 , which controls both the photon energy density through the observed schmidt law and the average gas density .",
    "these simplifying parameterizations allow us to qualitatively understand the frc over the range of star - forming galaxies , although it ignores deviations and complications that may be important for individual galaxies .",
    "we first describe the calculations necessary to find the cr spectra and observables for each galaxy ( section  [ sec : procedure ] ) .",
    "we review the effects of each parameter on the observables ( section  [ sec : effectsreview ] ) , before presenting our results ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of our work for cr physics ( section  [ sec : discussion ] ) , including whether calorimetry is correct ( section  [ sec : calorimeter ] ) , what causes the frc ( section  [ sec : frccauses ] ) , predictions for the frc at other frequencies ( section  [ sec : othernufrc ] ) , the spectral slope problem ( section  [ sec : alphadiscussion ] ) , the gamma - ray luminosities of galaxies ( section  [ sec : gammarays ] ) , and whether cr pressure and magnetic pressure are important as feedback mechanisms in galaxies ( section  [ sec : crpressures ] ) .",
    "we finally summarize our results ( section  [ sec : summary ] ) . in appendix  [ sec : variants ] , we present results from a suite of variants on our standard model , and show that those consistent with the frc have similar parameters to our standard model . for the reader s convenience , we list the symbols we use in our calculations and discussions in table  [ table : symbollist ] .",
    "we construct one - zone leaky box models of galaxies across the dynamic range of the observed frc .",
    "we treat star - forming galaxies as homogeneous disks of gas , characterized by a column density @xmath15 , a star formation rate surface density @xmath16 , and a scale height @xmath17 .",
    "we solve the steady - state diffusion - loss equation for the equilibrium cr spectra of primary and secondary electrons and positrons , as well as primary cr protons .",
    "term in the diffusion - loss equation is assumed to be small .",
    "for the milky way ( and presumably other normal spirals ) , the cr flux is known to be constant within a factor of @xmath18 for the last billion years from solar system studies @xcite .",
    "the tightness of the frc combined with the long timescales for galactic evolution also imply the cr population in normal galaxies is steady state .",
    "additionally , in extreme starbursts , the ic cooling time alone for ghz - emitting cr electrons ( @xmath19 ) is much shorter than the characteristic timescale for the system to evolve .",
    "therefore , we expect that the steady - state assumption is valid .",
    "however , we note that in weaker starbursts , where the cooling and escape times for crs are several myr , evolution may be important and the steady - state approximation may fail ( see * ? ? ?",

    "if the injected crs initially have a spectrum of the form @xmath26 and if escape is insignificant ( @xmath27 ) , the final spectrum will have the form @xmath28 .",
    "if instead cooling is insignificant compared to escape ( @xmath29 ) , the final spectrum will have the form @xmath30 .",

    "we also include knock - off electrons from cr proton collisions with atoms in the ism ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that both the primary cr electrons and protons are injected into galaxies with power law spectra @xmath36 with @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the lorentz factor ) , and we consider initial spectral slopes @xmath39 in the range @xmath40 .",
    "integrating the injection spectrum times the kinetic energy per particle @xmath41 gives the total power injected per unit volume for each primary species , @xmath42 , to set the normalization .",

    "the cr electron and proton emissivities @xmath46 are then proportional to the emissivity in starlight photons , @xmath47 , produced by star formation , when averaged over the star formation episode . following the discussion in @xcite , we calculate the starlight emissivity ( here , in units of @xmath48 ) as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a dimensionless initial mass function ( imf ) dependent constant that relates the luminosity in young stars to the instantaneous star formation rate , @xmath51 is the speed of light , @xmath17 is the cr scale height ( in cm ) , and @xmath16 is the surface density of star formation in cgs ] units of @xmath52 @xcite .",

    "2003 ) , we use equation ( [ eqn : standardcrlife ] ) for all fiducial models employing diffusive losses .",
    "variations to the diffusion constant are considered in appendices  [ sec : fastescape]-[sec : multipleeffects ] .",
    "there is ample evidence for large - scale mass - loaded winds in starburst galaxies with @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "these winds can advect crs out of their host galaxies on a short timescale with respect to equation ( [ eqn : standardcrlife ] ) , thus affecting both the predicted emission and the overall equilibrium energy density of crs .",
    "for this reason , we consider in section  [ sec : winds ] models of starburst galaxies with @xmath66 where we have taken @xmath67 , a wind speed of @xmath68 , and a cutoff between starburst and non - starburst galaxies of @xmath69 as reference values .",
    "the combined escape time in equation ( [ eqn : diffusionloss ] ) is then given by @xmath70 .      in our one - zone models ,",
    "the galaxy scale height represents the volume in which the crs are confined for @xmath60 ( eq .  [ eqn : diffusionloss ] ) . because we specify the properties of galaxies by their surface density , @xmath17 is also important in determining the average gas density seen by crs , which , in turn , is important for bremsstrahlung , ionization , and pion losses ( see section  [ section : density ] ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath71kpc for normal galaxies ( @xmath72 ) , although we consider several other scale heights in appendix  [ sec : scaleheight ] .",
    "there are several relevant scale heights which are not identical , and we must choose one for our one - zone model .",
    "crs are injected in the gas disk ( @xmath73 ) , but we do not use this scale height since the crs diffuse and emit synchrotron outside the gas disk . the observed beryllium isotope ratios , as interpreted by cr diffusion models imply that the crs have a scale height of 2 - 5 kpc in normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field scale heights of normal galaxies are also several kpc @xcite .",

    "on average , the thin and thick disks emit the same radio power at @xmath76 , and one component fits of the radio emission of normal galaxies generally find a one - component scale height of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "since we are most interested in the _ radio emission _ of normal galaxies to explain the frc , we use the value of @xmath78 from the one component fits .",
    "however , this one - zone approach does not capture all the relevant physics of the crs .",
    "in particular , the escape time in equation  ( [ eqn : standardcrlife ] ) applies to the entire cr halo .",
    "escape from the radio - emitting regions is likely quicker and is probably underestimated in our models .",
    "conversely , a variant on our fiducial model with large @xmath17 in appendix  [ sec : scaleheight ] probably overestimates the synchrotron losses in normal galaxies , since it does not account for the lower magnetic field strengths far from the midplane .",

    "[ sec : density ]    estimates from beryllium isotopes imply that the average density experienced by crs is about one fifth to one tenth that of the galactic disk",
    ". this may be because the ism is clumpy and the crs avoid the clumps , or because the crs spend significant time in the low - density galactic halo .",
    "crs do not necessarily travel through gas with the mean ism density .",
    "the actual average density crs experience depends upon the injection and propagation of the crs , which depends on the small - scale ism structure in galaxies and starbursts .",
    "for example , most of the volume of the ism in galaxies is low density material , and we can imagine the crs are injected into this low density phase and lose their energy before encountering high density clumps .",
    "then the density experienced by crs is lower than the average gas density .",
    "conversely , we can imagine that crs are preferentially injected into high density clumps , and are confined there by magnetic fields in the clumps , in which case , the crs experience a higher density than the average density of the galaxy or starburst .",
    "for this reason we include a parameter @xmath83 , to account for these unknown propagation and injection effects , defined by @xmath84 that measures the effective density `` seen '' by crs ( @xmath85 ) with respect to the average density of the cr confinement volume , @xmath86 . for @xmath87 or",

    "the primary importance of the parameter @xmath83 is in determining the importance of bremsstrahlung and ionization losses for cr electrons and positrons , and of pion production from inelastic proton - proton collisions .",
    "note that even though both the star formation rate and the magnetic fields of galaxies are taken to depend on the surface density ( see section  [ sec : magneticfield ] ) , they are assumed to be independent of @xmath83 .",
    "this means that the radiation energy density and the magnetic field the crs experience are assumed to be average , while the crs are allowed to traverse through underdense or overdense material .",
    "although we allow ourselves this freedom in the modeling , it turns out that the models with @xmath90 are most consistent with observations in the milky way .",
    "for example , our adopted gas surface density at the solar circle , @xmath91 @xcite , and scale height @xmath92 imply an average number density of @xmath93 . since the crs are inferred to travel through material of density @xmath94 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , this implies that @xmath90 .",

    "diffusive escape limited to the mean alfvn speed of the starburst would require strong magnetic fields ( @xmath297 ) with energy densities greater than the midplane gas pressure in starbursts to break proton calorimetry . we therefore conclude that proton calorimetry is difficult to avoid in @xmath90 starbursts with @xmath294 .",
    "calorimetry provides a simple way to explain the frc .",
    "we find that both electron and uv calorimetry hold for starbursts , and possibly the inner regions of normal galaxies , depending on the variant on our underlying model ( appendix  [ sec : variants ] ) .",
    "calorimetry therefore serves as the foundation of our explanation for the frc .",
    "other effects alter the radio luminosity , both at low density and high density , but by a factor of @xmath298 , compared to the dynamic range of @xmath299 in @xmath15 . at the order - of - magnitude level",
    ", calorimetry can be said to cause the frc , and other effects are relatively moderate corrections .    however , in more detail , we find that @xmath121 is not in fact flat even in the simple calorimeter model , with no escape , non - synchrotron cooling , or secondaries ( the light dotted line in figure  [ fig : highsgconspiracy ] )",
    ". instead , @xmath121 decreases by a factor of 2.6 as @xmath15 increases , because 1.4 ghz observations probe lower cr electron energies as the magnetic field strength increases .",
    "we call this decrease in @xmath121 with @xmath15 the `` @xmath197 effect '' . in general ,",
    "the effect becomes more significant as @xmath39 increases past 2.0 , because the electron spectrum becomes steeper .",
    "it can be shown that in this simplest calorimeter limit , @xmath300 .",
    "the radio luminosity in high - density galaxies is altered from the calorimetric luminosity mainly by two mechanisms , non - synchrotron cooling and the appearance of secondary electrons and positrons .",
    "we illustrate these effects in figure  [ fig : highsgconspiracy ] .    in normal galaxies ,",
    "synchrotron cooling dominates the energy losses , though bremsstrahlung and ic off the cmb can be competitive within a factor of a few or less . however , in starbursts , energy loss is mainly by bremsstrahlung and ionization .",
    "this decreases the proportion of energy lost that goes into radio .",
    "the energy diverted to bremsstrahlung and ionization therefore increases @xmath121 by a factor of up to @xmath301 in starbursts compared to normal galaxies ( compare the dotted and long - dashed lines in figure  [ fig : highsgconspiracy ] ) .",
    "secondary electrons and positrons themselves radiate in the radio . in the starbursts , which are proton calorimeters ,",
    "there are several times more secondaries than primary electrons , while in normal galaxies , the secondary contribution is small .",
    "secondaries increase the radio emission by a factor of @xmath190 in starbursts compared to normal galaxies ( compare the dotted and short - dashed lines in figure  [ fig : highsgconspiracy ] ) .",
    "these effects each on their own alter the calorimetric radio luminosity by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "since both are density dependent , they both become important in starbursts .",
    "however , combined with the @xmath197 effect ( section  [ sec : nuceffect ] ) in the simple calorimeter model , they largely cancel each other out to maintain a linear frc .",
    "the exact magnitudes of these effects are model dependent , but they are always important and the direction each works in is the same in every case .",
    "it is possible that relaxing the assumptions of our approach , such as including time dependence or spatial variation , could avoid the severe non - synchrotron losses and secondary electrons and positrons giving rise to this particular high-@xmath15 conspiracy .",
    "however , any new effects would have to be tuned to avoid the processes we already include while still reproducing the frc , trading one conspiracy for another .",
    "there are two other effects that appear in our variants ( appendix  [ sec : variants ] ) , but not our standard model , which can change the frc .",
    "first , if the magnetic field is assumed to depend on density instead of surface density ( section  [ sec : basn ] ) , the magnetic fields will be much stronger in the starbursts for the @xmath115 case , since the starbursts are more compact .",
    "this will make synchrotron cooling dominant again , upsetting the high-@xmath15 conspiracy .",
    "this effect can be compensated by winds and a weak magnetic field dependence on @xmath302 ( low @xmath106 ) .",
    "second , if the fir optical depth is significant ( section  [ sec : opticalthickfir ] ) , the photon energy density inside the galaxy is greater by a factor of @xmath303 than inferred from the photon flux alone .",
    "while typical fir opacities are small , the optical depth is appreciable in dense starbursts ( @xmath304 ) .",
    "this increases ic losses dramatically at the high densities , decreasing the radio luminosity .",
    "models with large fir optical depths have trouble reproducing the frc ( section  [ sec : opticalthickfir ] ) .      the radio luminosity in low density normal galaxies is modified by a different pair of opposing mechanisms , the failure of electron calorimetry and the failure of uv calorimetry .",
    "this conspiracy is illustrated in figure  [ fig : calorimetry ] for our standard model .",
    "normal galaxies are not generally electron calorimeters  both diffusive and advective escape can operate faster than cooling . in weak starbursts ( @xmath305 ) , escape can be competitive with cooling processes , but not in stronger starbursts .",
    "escape therefore decreases the radio emission in normal galaxies compared to the calorimetric expectation .",
    "however , normal galaxies are generally not uv calorimeters either ; a substantial fraction of the uv light emitted by star formation can escape without being reprocessed into fir light ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , normal galaxies also have a lower fir luminosity compared to the calorimetric expectation .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : calorimetry ] , each of these effects alters the frc by a factor of @xmath190 for @xmath260 in our standard model . since they work in opposite directions",
    ", the resulting @xmath121 nonetheless remains the same as the calorimetric prediction ( as suggested by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the boundary between these two conspiracies occurs when @xmath279 . in some variants ( appendix  [ sec : variants ] )",
    ", factors from both surface density regimes must be tuned to maintain the frc at this surface density : escape time , secondaries , non - synchrotron cooling , and magnetic field strength all have an effect on the radio luminosity .",
    "however , these starbursts are unavoidably opaque to uv light , so the full low-@xmath15 conspiracy can not work for these galaxies .",
    "this becomes a problem when cr escape is quick , such as when strong winds are present ( see section  [ sec : winds ] ) , causing these galaxies to be radio - dim .",
    "since the conspiracies begin to break down for the weakest starbursts , the transition from normal galaxies to starbursts may prove important in testing models of the frc .",
    "the many factors described above conspire to produce the frc , both in low - density non - calorimetric galaxies and high - density calorimetric starbursts .",
    "the traditional distinction between calorimeter and conspiracy explanations of the frc is not clear cut in our models .",
    "we find that the frc requires both calorimetry _ and _ conspiracy .",
    "we have mainly considered the well - studied frc at 1.4 ghz . however , the frc is also known to exist at 150 mhz @xcite , 4.8 ghz @xcite , and 10.55 ghz @xcite .",

    "the situation is similar , though the linear frc is somewhat better preserved : @xmath121 varies by a factor of 2.3 at 4.8 ghz , 2.8 at 8.4 ghz , and 3.6 at 22.5 ghz . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : othernulfirradio ] , at low frequencies the frc is predicted to tilt to the fir with increasing @xmath15 , while at high frequencies the correlation is predicted to tilt to the radio in starbursts .",
    "our fiducial model with winds and @xmath115 ( section  [ sec : winds ] ) predicts a similar increase in scatter at other frequencies ( @xmath121 varies by 2.1 at 500 mhz ; @xmath121 varies by 2.4 at 4.8 ghz ) .",

    ", @xmath121 decreases with increasing frequency .",

    "however , @xcite also finds a non - linear frc at 1.4 ghz , with no dependence on frequency for the slope of the frc , in contrast to @xcite who find a linear correlation ( except at low luminosities ) but only consider the frc at 1.4 ghz .",
    "at least two effects we do not include would complicate our predictions . at low frequencies , free - free absorption may significantly lower the radio flux beyond what we predict in starbursts .",
    "@xcite argue that free - free absorption is important even at ghz frequencies in starbursts like arp 220 , and it becomes more effective at low frequency .",
    "this effect would make the low frequency frc even more nonlinear than we predict .",
    "thermal emission becomes significant at high frequencies ( @xcite estimates that @xmath312 of the radio emission is thermal at 10.5 ghz ) .",
    "while the thermal contribution can be estimated and subtracted off , at very high frequencies it may so overwhelm the synchrotron radiation that studying the correlation between fir and nonthermal radio becomes impossible .          in the milky way , the observed spectral slope @xmath155 increases ( the spectrum steepens ) with frequency .",
    "at low frequencies ( @xmath313 ) , the spectral slope is only @xmath314 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) but @xmath155 reaches @xmath315 at ghz frequencies and reaches @xmath316 at several ghz @xcite before free - free emission flattens the spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , though there are variations with direction and galactic latitude ( for example , * ? ? ? * ) . in fact , our models predict a steepening with frequency , though in our standard model @xmath306 is higher than observed at all frequencies for @xmath317 : it is @xmath318 at 100 mhz , @xmath319 at 1 ghz , and @xmath320 at 10 ghz ( figure  [ fig : alphanu ] ; see also figures  [ fig : synchspectra ] and  [ fig : alpha ] ) .",

    "models with @xmath324 do a better job of matching the observed spectral slopes of the milky way .",
    "as can be seen by the cooling and escape times in figure  [ fig : tcool ] , our standard model implies that escape , synchrotron , and bremsstrahlung all can shape the spectrum in normal galaxies .",
    "escape dominates at low surface densities , while all three are comparable for the inner regions of galaxies ( @xmath325 ) .",
    "our greatest problem with @xmath155 for normal galaxies is that it is predicted to increase slightly with @xmath15 ( figure  [ fig : alpha ] ) .",
    "this would imply that the inner regions of spirals would have steeper spectra than the outer regions , when in fact the opposite effect is observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the reason for the steepening is that escape becomes less effective as the galaxies become denser , so that cooling prevails . in normal galaxies",
    ", synchrotron dominates bremsstrahlung by a factor of a few ( and ionization by an order of magnitude ) , and the ratio of the synchrotron to bremsstrahlung cooling times is only weakly dependent on density ( compare the short - dashed synchrotron and the long - dashed bremsstrahlung lines in figure  [ fig : tcool ] ) . for a constant scale height so that @xmath326 , we have from equations  [ eqn : tsynch ] and  [ eqn : tbrems ] that @xmath327 , which is essentially constant for @xmath113 and slowly changing for @xmath328 .",

    "this implies that synchrotron losses become much more effective than escape as density increases , but the bremsstrahlung losses remain a factor of a few less important than synchrotron losses .",
    "therefore , as normal galaxies become calorimetric , their radio spectra will become steep in our model , since bremsstrahlung is only important enough to flatten the spectrum from its pure synchrotron - cooled limit of @xmath330 to @xmath331 .",
    "this problem remains for all of the variants ( appendix  [ sec : variants ] ) that satisfy local or integrated constraints , except in the strong wind variant ( section  [ sec : winds ] ) in which we include advective escape that would result from the wind inferred by @xcite , and the fast diffusive escape variant ( section  [ sec : fastescape ] ) .",

    "the reason for the relatively high variation in @xmath121 is that @xmath83 is low : starbursts are still proton calorimeters , producing secondaries that contribute to the radio ; bremsstrahlung and ionization losses , which compete for the energy available for radio emission , are much weaker than in the standard model ( section  [ sec : frccauses ] ) . at high surface densities ,",

    "the escape time from the radio disk itself may be significantly shorter . variants in which the scale height of normal galaxies is increased ( appendix  [ sec : scaleheight ] ) still may not properly model the radio disk , because they use the midplane magnetic field strength , possibly overestimating the effectiveness of synchrotron losses .",
    "we consider the effect of faster diffusive escape of by running models in which the diffusive escape time in galaxies is shortened by a factor of @xmath436 from the nominal lifetime in equation  [ eqn : standardcrlife ] .",

    "this could break the frc at the transition between normal galaxies and starbursts .    to see whether this variation had any effect , we modify the escape time to @xmath446 .",
    "we ran our grid for two cases that had worked previously : the standard model where @xmath218 and with no winds , and the case with ( weak ) winds and @xmath115 ( see section  [ sec : winds ] ) . in standard models with constant @xmath444 , the vastly more efficient escape of crs in weak starbursts ( @xmath279 ) broke the frc .",

    "bremsstrahlung and ionization mainly balance the @xmath197 effect in these galaxies , which only lowers @xmath121 by a factor of @xmath449 from @xmath260 normal galaxies . in denser starbursts ,",
    "bremsstrahlung and ionization grow in importance , but are balanced by secondaries .",
    "overall the conspiracy presented in figure  [ fig : highsigmagvariants ] is weaker than in the fiducial model , with non - synchrotron losses suppressing synchrotron losses by only @xmath450 for starbursts , because @xmath106 is relatively high .",
    "note that constant @xmath444 from normal galaxies to starbursts is not necessarily correct .",
    "the speed crs can stream out of galaxies is expected to be limited to the alfvn speed , @xmath269 ( section  [ sec : calorimeter ] ; @xcite ) . for @xmath383 , this comes out to a diffusive escape time of @xmath451 , where @xmath452 . while this is shorter than the milky way cr escape time ( eq .

    "we once again test it against @xmath218 with no winds and @xmath115 with winds .",

    "we include starburst winds , the fir optical depth , @xmath115 , and constant @xmath444 , @xmath453 , or @xmath456 simultaneously .",

    "<S> the far - infrared ( fir ) and radio luminosities of star - forming galaxies are linearly correlated over a very wide range in star formation rate , from normal spirals like the milky way to the most intense starbursts . using one - zone models of cosmic ray ( cr ) injection , cooling , and escape in star - forming galaxies , we attempt to reproduce the observed fir - radio correlation ( frc ) over its entire span . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization and linearity of the frc , together with constraints on the cr population in the milky way , have strong implications for the cr and magnetic energy densities in star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for consistency with the frc , @xmath02% of the kinetic energy from supernova explosions must go into high energy primary cr electrons and that @xmath010% - 20% must go into high energy primary cr protons . </S>",
    "<S> secondary electrons and positrons are likely comparable to or dominate primary electrons in dense starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of our models for the magnetic field strengths of starbursts , the detectability of starbursts by _ fermi _ , and cr feedback . </S>",
    "<S> overall , our models indicate that both cr protons and electrons escape from low surface density galaxies , but lose most of their energy before escaping dense starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the frc is caused by a combination of the efficient cooling of cr electrons ( calorimetry ) in starbursts and a conspiracy of several factors . </S>",
    "<S> for lower surface density galaxies , the decreasing radio emission caused by cr escape is balanced by the decreasing fir emission caused by the low effective uv dust opacity . in starbursts , </S>",
    "<S> bremsstrahlung , ionization , and inverse compton cooling decrease the radio emission , but they are countered by secondary electrons / positrons and the dependence of synchrotron frequency on energy , which both increase the radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions hold for a broad range of variations on our fiducial model , such as those including winds , different magnetic field strengths , and different diffusive escape times . </S>"
