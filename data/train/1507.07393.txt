    "spicules can be seen almost everywhere at the solar limb .",
    "they are highly - dynamic , thin , jet - like features in the solar chromosphere .",
    "spicules have been observed for a very long time and have been the subject of numerous reviews @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most interesting aspect about spicules is their potential to mediate the transfer of energy and mass from the photosphere to the corona .",
    "this potential has been recognized early @xcite , but the lack of high - quality observations prevented a better understanding of spicules and their link to the corona @xcite .",
    "the advent of the hinode solar optical telescope(_sot _ ) @xcite provided a quantum leap in the understanding of spicules and their properties . with its seeing free high spatial and temporal resolution observations of the chromosphere , hinode showed much more dynamic spicules than previously thought and re - ignited the discussion on their potential to heat the corona @xcite .",
    "while there are several recent studies of the properties of spicules using hinode / sot @xcite , they are either preliminary results papers or cover only one or two data sets .",
    "it is encouraging that the results from the various groups agree quite well , despite the difficulties in obtaining reliable magnetic field measurements at the limb . @xcite",
    "used full stokes polarimetry and hanle effect modelling of he i d3 spectra and find that the magnetic field strength is mostly 10 g at 3500 km height , with some spicules possibly showing fields up to 40 g. @xcite used both the hanle and zeeman effects and full stokes polarimetry of the he i 10830 line and find 10 g at 2000 km and again , some spicules with field strengths up to 40 g. doppler velocities of solar limb spicules show oscillations with periods of @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xmath16 s. there is also clear evidence of 3-min oscillations at the observed heights .",
    "the observed upwards steady flows are @xmath17",
    " @xmath18 km s@xmath7 with short periods ( @xmath14 s ) in type i spicules .",
    "type i spicules have typical lifetimes of @xmath19 s and maximum ascending velocities of @xmath20 km s@xmath7 .",
    "type ii spicules in the quiet sun have lifetimes between @xmath21 s , and slightly less in coronal holes .",
    "they have a maximum velocity between @xmath22 km s@xmath7 , with a very small amount with velocities greater than @xmath23 km s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "all spicule oscillations events are summarized in a recent review by @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the observed oscillation periods can be formally divided in two groups : those with shorter periods ( @xmath24 min ) and those with longer periods ( @xmath25 min)@xcite . the most frequently observed oscillations lie in the period ranges of @xmath26 min and @xmath27 s. these spiky dynamic jets",
    "are propelled upwards at speeds of about @xmath28 km s@xmath7 from photosphere into the magnetized low atmosphere of the sun .",
    "their diameter varies from spicule to spicule having the values from 400 km to 1500 km .",
    "the mean length of classical spicules varies from 5000 km to 9000 km , and their typical life time is @xmath29 min .    the typical electron density at heights where the spicules are observed is @xmath30  @xmath31 kg m@xmath32 , and their temperatures are estimated @xmath33k @xcite .",
    "their periods are estimated @xmath14 and @xmath34 s. @xcite , based on hinode observations concluded that the most expected periods of transverse oscillations lay between @xmath35 ",
    "@xmath36 s , which interpreted as signatures of alfvn waves .",
    "phase speed begins from * @xmath0 * @xmath37 km s@xmath7 at lower heights and reaches to the maximum value of * @xmath0 * 90 km s@xmath7 at * @xmath0 * @xmath38 km .",
    "then , it decreases to the minimum value of * * @xmath0**@xmath28 km s@xmath7 at * * @xmath0**@xmath39 km @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observed quasi - periodic displacement of spicule axis can be caused due to fundamental standing mode of kink waves .",
    "the energy flux storied in the oscillation is estimated as 150 j m@xmath13 s@xmath7 , which is of the order of coronal energy losses in quiet sun regions @xcite .",
    "spicule seismology , which means the determination of spicule properties from observed oscillations and was originally suggested by @xcite , has been significantly developed during last years @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we study the observed oscillations in the solar spicules through the data obtained from hinode .",
    "we trace the spicule axis oscillations via time slice diagrams for determining period , amplitude , phase speed , magnetic field , alfvn speed and energy flux of the studied spicules . observed waves can be used as a tool for spicule seismology .",
    "a description of the observations and image processing is made in section  [ sec : observations ] and in section  [ sec : results ] we discuss spicules properties .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we used a time series of h - line ( 396.86 nm ) obtained on 22 january , 2007 , during 23:26 to 23:42 ut by the solar optical telescope onboard @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolution reaches 0.2 arcsec ( * * @xmath0**150 km ) and the pixel size is 0.109 arcsec ( * * @xmath0**80 km ) in the h - line .",
    "the time series has a cadence of 20 seconds with an exposure time of 0.5 seconds .",
    "the position of @xmath40@xmath41 and @xmath42@xmath41 of slot are 945 arcsec and 0 arcsec , while x - fov and y - fov are 223 arcsec and 112 arcsec , respectively .",
    "the `` fgprep'',``fgrigidalign''(available in solarsoft , http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft ) and `` madmax '' idl algorithms are used to reduce the images spikes and jitter effect , to align time series , and to enhance the finest structures , respectively @xcite .",
    "in figure  [ fig1 ] , we presented the full view ca ii h - line image of the equator which contains the studied spicules .",
    "the processed spicules are indicated by red arrows on this image .",
    "this image was taken by hinode / sot telescope on 22 jan , 2007 , 23:26:04 ut . we used the time series images of this region and determined period , amplitude , phase speed , magnetic field , alfvn speed and energy flux of the studied spicules . to this end , we selected 14 random spicules and used time - slice diagrams to illustrate their transversal oscillations .    in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we presented the time slice diagrams of the time series which consists of 30 consecutive images .",
    "the bright regions show the transversal oscillations of spicules axis .",
    "the clear quasi - periodic transverse motion of the spicules axis is seen on the figure .",
    "it should be noted that these diagrams are performed at the same height from the limb . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we presented the time slice diagrams and fitted polynomials for three spicules . as it is clear ,",
    "the fitted functions are the best ones for our observed results .",
    "we estimated the oscillation period and amplitude at each diagram and presented them in table 1 .                                 [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the density is almost homogeneous along the spicule axis @xcite ; therefore , the density scale height should be much longer than the spicule length .",
    "the variation of oscillation amplitude with height can not be due to the decreased density .",
    "so , we may have that the oscillation amplitude is proportional to sin(kz ) , where k is the oscillation wave number .",
    "this expression can be approximated in the long wavelength limit as * @xmath0 * kz .",
    "hence , the oscillation wavelength is @xmath3 * @xmath0 * 1/0.06 arcsec * @xmath0 * 11500 km @xcite .",
    "this allows the estimation of the kink speed as @xmath43 @xmath5@xmath6 km s@xmath7 .",
    "it is possible to estimate the alfvn speed and consequently magnetic field strength through them .",
    "kink waves are transverse oscillations of magnetic tubes and the phase speed for a straight homogenous tube can be written as : @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the alfvn speed inside the tube , @xmath3 is the wavelength and @xmath46 is the observed oscillation period . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the plasma density outside and inside of tube , respectively .",
    "the density in spicules is @xmath49 kg m@xmath32 and @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the oscillation amplitude and phase speed allows to estimate the energy flux , f , storied in the oscillations :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are density , wave amplitude and phase speed , respectively @xcite .",
    "the wave velocity can be determined as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the axis displacement estimated as * @xmath0 * @xmath2 arcsec and @xmath46 is the oscillation period estimated as * @xmath0 * @xmath1 s. with these parameters the energy flux is estimated as @xmath57 = @xmath11  @xmath12 jm@xmath13s@xmath7 .    using the kink speed , the magnetic field strength in spicules at the height of @xmath58 km",
    "is estimated as @xmath8 = @xmath9 ",
    "@xmath10 g. this is in good agreement with recently estimated magnetic field strengths in quiet - sun spicules ( * * @xmath0**10 g ) , which was obtained by spectropolarimetric observations of solar chromosphere in he i @xmath3 10830 @xcite .",
    "we performed the analysis of ca      h - line time series at the solar limb obtained from _",

    "we studied 14 random spicules and found that their axis undergo quasi - periodic transverse displacements .",
    "the period of the transverse displacements are * @xmath0 * @xmath1 s and the amplitude are * @xmath0 * @xmath2 arcsec .",
    "the same periodicity was found in doppler shift oscillation by @xcite and @xcite , so the periodicity is probably common for spicules .",
