    "the @xmath11-state potts model in three dimensions is defined by the partition function @xmath12 where the summation is taken over all nearest neighbour pairs of sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 on a simple cubic lattice @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the reduced inverse temperature . the 3-state potts model can be transformed into the @xmath3@xmath17 clock model @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the volume of the lattice and @xmath21 . in the following",

[ z3 ] hence we obtain for the magnetization of the ferromagnetic redefined model & = & _ i_i + & = & _ i^a_i - _ i^b_i . note that this definition of the magnetization is the same as the one given by ono @xcite .",

    "@xcite used a variant choice of the order parameter .",

    "the susceptibility diverges as ~l^ , [ chifinite ] where @xmath31 is the critical exponent of the correlation length and @xmath32 the critical exponent of the susceptibility .",
    "we studied the fourth - order cumulant of the magnetization u_l= 1- .",

    "we have performed simulations at @xmath37 , which is the estimate for the critical coupling obtained in ref .",

    "for comparison we give the analogous results for the 3d xy model .",
    "a careful reanalysis , taking into account eq.([kcross ] ) , leads to a small shift in @xmath40 compared to ref .",
    "@xcite where we quoted @xmath68 as final result .",
    "this shift of the coupling also implies a slight change in the result for the cumulants .",
    "the higher accuracy of the values for the potts model is due to higher statistics and to a smaller variation of the fit results within the error - bars of the critical coupling .",
    "note that the accurately determined values of the cumulants of the two models coincide within the error - bars .",
    "this fact strongly favours the hypothesis that the two models belong to the same universality class .",

    "the convergence of the @xmath31 computed from @xmath45 is worse .",
    "the @xmath73 and @xmath74 results are off by more than three times the error - bars .",
    "we also performed a two parameter fit to eq.([slope ] ) .",
    "the estimates of the fits are given in table  [ nufittab ] .",
    "when we discard the data stemming from the @xmath55 and 8 lattices , we get a @xmath75 smaller then 1 .",
    "if we take the uncertainty of the critical coupling into account we obtain the following values for the exponent @xmath31 :    ccc + @xmath57 & @xmath58 & @xmath45 + @xmath76 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 +    one has to note that a small @xmath75 does not mean that errors due to corrections to scaling are negligible .",
    "we have seen in the discussion of the cumulants that @xmath45 is much more affected by corrections to scaling than the fourth - order cumulant .",
    "hence the result for @xmath31 obtained from @xmath45 should not be taken too seriously . as our final result",
    ", we take the value @xmath2 obtained from the fourth - order cumulant on the full lattice .    in order to estimate the ratio @xmath79 of the critical exponents we studied the scaling behaviour of the magnetic susceptibility defined on the full lattice and on sub - blocks .",

    "however , the estimates of @xmath79 from @xmath83 and @xmath84 obtained from the largest lattices coincide within the error - bars . hence we take @xmath85 obtained from the ratio of @xmath83 of the largest lattices as our final result , where statistical as well as systematic errors should be covered .",

    "a universality class should be characterized by the dimensionality of the system and the symmetry of the order parameter at criticality @xcite .",
