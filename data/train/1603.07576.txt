    "orthogonal multi - user access ( oma ) techniques are used in 4 g long term evolution ( lte ) and lte - advanced ( lte - a ) networks , e.g. , orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) for downlink and single - carrier frequency division multiple access ( sc - fdma ) for uplink @xcite . in oma , within a cell , each user has exclusive access to the allocated resource blocks .",
    "thus , each subchannel or subcarrier can only be utilized by at most one user in every time slot .",
    "oma avoids intra - cell interference , and enables single - user detection / decoding and simple receiver design .",
    "however , by its nature , orthogonal channel access is becoming a limiting factor of spectrum efficiency .",
    "in the coming decade , the mobile data traffic is expected to grow thousand - fold @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the network capacity must dramatically increase for 5 g systems .",
    "capacity scaling for 5 g is enabled by a range of techniques and schemes , e.g. , cell densification , utilization of unlicensed spectrum , and advanced radio access schemes .",
    "new multi - user access schemes have been investigated as potential alternatives to ofdma and sc - fdma @xcite .",
    "a promising scheme is the so - called non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma ) with successive interference cancellation ( sic ) @xcite . unlike interference - avoidance",
    "multiple access schemes , e.g. , ofdma , multiple users in noma can be assigned to the same frequency - time resource so as to improve spectrum efficiency @xcite . on one hand , this results in intra - cell interference among the multiplexed users . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the interfering signals in noma can be eliminated by multi - user detection ( mud ) with sic at the receiver side . to enable this process ,",
    "more advanced receiver design and interference management techniques are considered to be the key aspects in 5 g networks @xcite .      from an information theory perspective , under the assumption of simultaneous multi - user transmission via superposition coding with sic , capacity region and duality analysis",
    "have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite have provided an analysis of implementing interference cancellation in cellular systems . towards future 5 g communication systems , some candidate access schemes are under investigation in recent research activities , e.g. , sparse code multiple access ( scma ) @xcite , and noma @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied the capacity region for noma . in @xcite , by assuming predefined user groups for each subchannel , a heuristic algorithm for noma power allocation in downlink has been proposed , and system - level simulations have been conducted .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered a sum - rate utility maximization problem for dynamic noma resource allocation . in @xcite ,",
    "outage performance of noma has been evaluated .",
    "the authors derived the ergodic sum rate and outage probability to demonstrate the superior performance of noma with fixed power allocation . in @xcite , fairness considerations and a max - min fairness problem for noma have been addressed .",
    "the fairness in noma can be improved via using and adapting the so - called power allocation coefficients . for uplink noma ,",
    "the authors in @xcite provided a suboptimal algorithm to solve an uplink scheduling problem with fixed transmission power . in @xcite ,",
    "a weighted multi - user scheduling scheme is proposed to balance the total throughput and the cell - edge user throughput . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a greedy - based algorithm to improve the throughput in uplink noma . in @xcite , the authors studied and evaluated user grouping / pairing strategies in noma .",
    "it has been shown that , from the outage probability perspective , it is preferable to multiplex users of large gain difference on the same subcarrier .",
    "we also remark that there are other setups of sic than that considered in noma .",
    "an example is the interference channel in which common information is transmitted for partial interference cancellation , for which etkin  et  al .",
    "@xcite provided an analysis of the resulting capacity region and trade - off from an information theory perspective .",
    "apart from investigation of noma performance in cellular networks , from a general optimization perspective , the complexity and tractability analysis of noma resource allocation is of significance . here ,",
    "tractability for an optimization problem refers to whether or not any polynomial - time algorithm can be expected to find the global optimum @xcite .",
    "tractability results for resource allocation in oma and interference channels have been investigated in a few existing works , e.g. , @xcite for ofdma , @xcite for sc - fdma , and @xcite for interference channel . for noma , to the best of our knowledge , no such study is available in the existing literature .      in spite of the existing literature of performance evaluation for noma ,",
    "there is lack of a systematic approach for noma resource allocation from a mathematical optimization point of view .",
    "the existing resource allocation approaches for noma are typically carried out with fixed power allocation @xcite , predefined user set for subchannels @xcite , or parameter tuning to improve performance , e.g. , updating power allocation coefficients @xcite .",
    "moreover , compared with oma , noma allows multi - user sharing on the same subchannel , thus provides an extra dimension to influence the performance in throughput and fairness .",
    "however , how to balance these two key performance aspects in power and channel allocation is largely not yet studied in the literature .",
    "in addition , little is known on the computational complexity and tractability of noma resource allocation .    in this paper ,",
    "the solutions of joint channel and power allocation for noma are subject to systematic optimization , rather than using heuristics or ad - hoc methods . to this end , we formulate , analyze , and solve the power and channel optimization problem for downlink noma systems , taking into account practical considerations of fairness and sic .",
    "we present the following contributions .",
    "first , for maximum weighted - sum - rate ( wsr ) and sum - rate ( sr ) utilities , we formulate the joint power and channel allocation problems ( ) mathematically .",
    "second , we prove the np - hardness of with wsr and sr utilities .",
    "third , we identify tractable cases for and provide the tractability analysis .",
    "fourth , considering the intractability of in general , we propose an algorithmic framework based on lagrangian duality and dynamic programming to facilitate problem solving .",
    "unlike previous works , our approach contributes to delivering near - optimal solutions , as well as performance bounds on global optimum to demonstrate the quality of our near - optimal solutions .",
    "we use numerical results to illustrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed algorithm over existing noma and ofdma schemes .",
    "our work extends previous study of user grouping in noma . in @xcite ,",
    "the number of users to be multiplexed on a subcarrier is fixed , and performance evaluation consists of rule - based multiplexing policies . in our case , for each subcarrier , the number of users and their composition are both output from solving an optimization problem . later in section  vii ,",
    "results of optimized subcarrier assignment and user grouping will be presented for analysis .",
    "the current paper extends our previous study @xcite in several dimensions .",
    "the extensions consist of the consideration of the wsr utility metric , a significant amount of additional theoretical analysis of problem tractability , the development of the performance bound on global optimality , as well as the consideration of user fairness in performance evaluation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives the system models for single - carrier and multi - carrier noma cellular systems .",
    "section iii formulates for wsr utility and provides complexity analysis .",

    "we consider a downlink cellular system with a base station ( bs ) serving @xmath0 users .",
    "the overall bandwidth @xmath1 is divided into @xmath2 subchannels , each with bandwidth @xmath3 . throughout the paper , we refer to subchannel interchangeably with subcarrier .",
    "we use @xmath4 and @xmath5 to denote the sets of users and subchannels , respectively , and @xmath6 to denote the channel gain between the bs and user @xmath7 on subcarrier @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the power allocated to user @xmath7 on subcarrier @xmath8 .",
    "a user @xmath7 is said to be multiplexed on a subchannel @xmath8 , if and only if @xmath10 . the power values are subject to optimization . at the receiver ,",
    "each user equipment has mud capabilities to perform multi - user signal decoding @xcite . with sic ,",
    "some of the co - channel interference will be treated as decodable signals instead of as additive noise .      to ease the presentation of the system model , for the moment let us consider the case that all the @xmath0 users can multiplex on each subcarrier @xmath8 in a multi - carrier noma system ( mc - noma ) at downlink . for each subcarrier @xmath8 ,",
    "we sort the users in set @xmath4 in the descending order of channel gains , and use bijection @xmath11 : @xmath12 to represent this order , where @xmath11 is the position of user @xmath13 in the sorted sequence . for our downlink system scenario , in @xcite (",
    "chapter  6.2.2 ) it is shown that , with superposition coding , user @xmath7 with better channel gain @xmath6 can decode the signal of user @xmath14 with worse channel gain @xmath15 , and this is not constrained by the specific power allocation .",
    "thus receiver @xmath7 is able to perform sic , by subtracting the re - encoded signal intended for receiver @xmath14 from the composite signal , and thereby obtaining an increase in the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) .",
    "thus , user @xmath7 on subcarrier @xmath8 , before decoding its signal of interest , first decodes the received interfering signals intended for the users @xmath16 that appear later in the sequence than @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath17 . the interfering signals with order @xmath18 will not be decoded and thus treated as noise . hence",
    ", the interference after sic for user @xmath7 on subcarrier @xmath8 is @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "if there are users having the same channel gain , then sic applies following the principle in @xcite ( chapter  6.2.2 ) , provided that an ordering of the users is given . from the discussion , the sinr of user @xmath7 on subcarrier @xmath8 is given below .",
    "@xmath21 the noise power is denoted by @xmath22 , which equals the product of the power spectral density of white gaussian noise and the subcarrier bandwidth .",
    "the rate of each user in noma is determined by the user s sinr after sic .",
    "thus , the achievable rate of user @xmath7 on subcarrier @xmath8 is @xmath23 nat / s with normalized bandwidth @xmath24 .    for single - carrier noma systems ( sc - noma )",
    ", we omit the subcarrier index . for convenience ,",
    "the users @xmath25 in sc - noma are defined in the descending order of channel gains , where @xmath26 .",
    "thus the user index also represents its position in the sequence , and user @xmath7 is able to decode the signal of user @xmath14 if @xmath27 .",
    "we define @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the achievable rate of user @xmath7 is @xmath30 = @xmath31 nat / s with normalized bandwidth @xmath32 . for illustration , consider a two - user case with @xmath33 in sc - noma . following the system model ,",
    "user @xmath34 is capable of decoding the interfering signal from user @xmath35 . for user @xmath34 , before decoding its own signal , the interference from user 2 s signal is first decoded and removed , resulting in user 1 s achievable rate @xmath36 . for user @xmath35 ,",
    "no sic takes place , hence the achievable rate is @xmath37 .",
    "we use @xmath38 as a generic notation for the set of users multiplexed on subchannel @xmath8 for mc - noma . for sc - noma , the corresponding entity",
    "is denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "we use @xmath40 , @xmath41 , to denote the maximum number of multiplexed users on a subcarrier .",
    "the reason of having this parameter is to address complexity considerations of implementing mud and sic . in noma ,",
    "the system complexity increases by @xmath40 , because a user device needs to decode up to @xmath40 signals .",
    "the setting of @xmath40 depends on receiver s design complexity and signal processing delay for sic @xcite . for practical implementation",
    ", @xmath40 is typically smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "however , our optimization formulations and the solution algorithm are applicable to any value of @xmath40 between one and @xmath0 .",
    "two utility functions , wsr and sr , are considered in this paper .",
    "the wsr utility is denoted by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the weight coefficient of user @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , the selection of the weights has strong influence on the resource allocation among the users . in general",
    ", the weights can be used to steer the resource allocation towards various goals , such as to implement service class priority of users , and fairness ( e.g. , a user with averagely poor channel receives higher weight ) . in our work ,",
    "the algorithmic approach is applicable without any assumption of the specific weight setting . for performance evaluation",
    ", we set the weights following proportional fairness .",
    "that is , for one time slot , a user s weight is set to be the reciprocal of the average user rate prior to the current time slot @xcite . as a result , the resource allocation will approach proportional fairness over time .",
    "the sr utility , a special case of wsr , is defined as @xmath44 .",
    "the term of sr utility is used interchangeably throughput in this paper . for both sr and wsr ,",
    "sic with superposition coding @xcite applies to the users multiplexed on the same subcarrier .",
    "as was discussed earlier , the decoding does not rely on assuming specific , a priori constraint on the power allocation among the users .",
    "in this section , we formulate using wsr utility for mc - noma . we use to denote the optimization problem . in general ,",
    "amounts to determining which users should be allocated to which subcarriers , as well as the optimal power allocation such that the total utility is maximized . in the following",
    "we define the variables and formulate as @xmath45 below , where all @xmath46-variables and @xmath47-variables are collected in vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "@xmath50 @xmath51 = @xmath52if user @xmath7 is multiplexed on subcarrier @xmath8@xmath53i.e .",
    ", @xmath10@xmath54otherwise@xmath55    [ eq : p1 ] @xmath56    in @xmath57 , the objective ( [ eq : p1obj ] ) is to maximize the wsr utility , where @xmath58 contains the @xmath46-variables , see ( [ eq : rkn ] ) below .",
    "@xmath59 constraints ( [ eq : p11 ] ) and ( [ eq : p12 ] ) are respectively imposed to ensure that the total power budget and the individual power limit for each user are not exceeded .",
    "the per - user power limit @xmath60 is introduced for practical considerations , such as regulatory requirement on power towards a user device .",
    "such a limit is also very common in oma ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "constraints ( [ eq : p13 ] ) restrict the maximum number of multiplexed users on each subcarrier to @xmath40 .",
    "we remark that the power allocation is represented by the @xmath46-variables of which the values are subject to optimization , whereas the power limits @xmath61 and @xmath62 are given entities .",
    "suppose @xmath40 users , say users @xmath63 , are allocated with positive power on channel @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath64 happens to hold , then all the @xmath40 users may be at their respective power limits , i.e. , setting @xmath65 , is feasible .",
    "otherwise , the @xmath40 users can still be allocated with positive power , though not all of them can be at the power limits . indeed ,",
    "if user @xmath7 is allocated with power @xmath66 on channel @xmath8 , then typically @xmath67",
    "unless user @xmath7 is not allocated power on any other channel than @xmath8 . for the total power limit @xmath61 to be meaningful , one can assume @xmath68 without loss of generality , because otherwise the total power limit @xmath61 is not violated even if all users are allocated with their respective maximum power , that is , ( [ eq : p11 ] ) becomes void and should be dropped .",
    "we do not consider any further specific assumptions on the relation between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , to keep the generality of the system model .",
    "we do not explicitly impose the constraint that @xmath10 if and only if @xmath69 .",
    "this is because setting @xmath10 and @xmath70 is clearly not optimal , by the facts that @xmath10 will lead to rate degradation of other users due to the co - channel interference ( if there are other users on channel @xmath8 ) , and that for user @xmath7 , @xmath10 means power is consumed , but @xmath70 means no benefit as the rate in becomes zero .",
    "@xmath71    it can be observed that formulation @xmath45 is non - linear and non - convex .",
    "the concavity of the objective function ( [ eq : p1obj ] ) can not be established in general , because of the presence of the binary @xmath47-variables and the product of @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "note that in complexity theory , neither non - convexity nor non - linearity of a formulation proves the problem s hardness , as a problem could be inappropriately formulated .",
    "therefore , we provide formal hardness analysis for below .    is np - hard .",
    "[ th : wnphard ]    we establish the result in two steps .",
    "first , we conclude that if @xmath72 in ( [ eq : p13 ] ) , is np - hard , as it reduces to ofdma subcarrier and power allocation , for which np - hardness is provided in @xcite and @xcite . for general mc - noma with @xmath73",
    ", we construct an instance of and establish the equivalence between the instance and the ofdma problem considered in @xcite .",
    "we consider an instance of with @xmath0 users , @xmath2 subcarriers , and @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 denote a small value with @xmath76 .",
    "the total power @xmath61 is set to @xmath77 .",
    "the power limit @xmath78 is uniform for @xmath29 , and the noise parameter @xmath79 . among the @xmath0 users , we select an arbitrary one , denoted by @xmath80 , and assign a dominating weight @xmath81 and channel gain @xmath82 on all the subcarriers , whereas the other users weights and channel gains are @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . from above , the ratios @xmath87 and @xmath88 are sufficiently large such that allocating any power @xmath89 to user @xmath90 on any subcarrier @xmath8 , the utility @xmath91 for using the same power budget @xmath46 , since @xmath92 is bounded by @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is clearly greater than @xmath93 .",
    "thus , allocating power to user @xmath90 rather than other users is preferable for maximizing utility .    due to the uniform gain @xmath95 and the dominating weight @xmath96 for user @xmath90 on all channels , the optimal power allocation for user",
    "@xmath90 is to uniformly allocate an amount of @xmath97 to each subcarrier .",
    "then the remaining problem is to allocate power @xmath98 to the remaining @xmath99 users .",
    "every user @xmath100 is still subject to the user power constraint ( [ eq : p12 ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath74 , each subcarrier now can accommodate one extra user at most .",
    "compared to the ofdma problem in @xcite , has one extra total power constraint , i.e. , ( [ eq : p11 ] ) , however , recall that @xmath61 is set to @xmath77 , and for this value ( [ eq : p11 ] ) is in fact redundant .",
    "therefore , a special case of with @xmath101 is equivalent to the ofdma problem in @xcite , and the result follows .",
    "the hardness of could have stemmed from several sources , e.g. , the structure of the utility function , discrete variables , non - concave objective , and the constraints .",
    "we start from investigating how the weight in the utility function influences the problem s tractability",
    ". the utility function can affect the computational complexity in problem solving @xcite .",
    "one example is that the sr maximization problem with total power constraint in ofdma is polynomial - time solvable @xcite .",
    "with wsr utility , solving the same problem is challenging @xcite . in this section",
    ", we consider a special problem of , i.e. , sr utility with uniform weights for users .",
    "we use to denote the optimization problem .",
    "intuitively , appears somewhat easier than , however , the tractability of , for both sc - noma and mc - noma , is not known in the literature . in the following , analogously to",
    ", we formulate in @xmath102 .",

    "[ th : noskip ] for in sc - noma , the following hold at the optimum : + ( a ) suppose @xmath104 for two users @xmath7 and @xmath14 with @xmath105 , then the optimal power allocation satisfies @xmath106 only if @xmath107 .",
    "+ ( b ) up to @xmath40 consecutive users in descending order of channel gain are allocated with positive power .    as defined in the sc - noma system model ,",

    "@xmath113    for conclusion ( a ) , since @xmath114 for the single subcarrier in sc - noma , it can be easily checked from ( [ pd ] ) that the partial derivatives @xmath115 , irrespective of the power values . in general , from the partial derivatives , more utility will be obtained by increasing power @xmath116 instead of @xmath117 if @xmath118 . if the user with the best channel condition , i.e. user 1 , has @xmath119 , the objective value @xmath120 can be improved by shifting power from other users to user 1 until @xmath121 equals the power limit @xmath122 .",
    "statement ( a ) also implies that the optimal power allocation will be in a consecutive manner , i.e. , from user 1 to user @xmath40 , one by one , and the result of ( b ) follows .    by theorem",
    "[ th : noskip ] , for the sr utility , the users being allocated positive power at optimum are consecutive in their gain values , starting from the user with the best channel gain .",

    "we also notice that increasing @xmath40 results in degradation of ub- .",
    "the main reason is that when @xmath40 grows , the over - calculations in the objective of @xmath289 are accumulated over all multiplexed users .     4 and 20 , @xmath365 , @xmath359 , and @xmath74 .",

    "a majority of the iterations is part of the tailing - off effect .",
    "the utility ( @xmath366 of the algorithm ) and the lagrangian dual function ( @xmath367 ) ) both approach the achievable values with 10 iterations or fewer .",
    "note that each iteration has polynomial - time complexity , see theorem  [ dp ] .",
    "as our next part of results , we evaluate the performance for , noma - ftpc , and ofdma - ftpc in fairness .",
    "we examine the fairness over a scheduling time period . as was mentioned earlier , scheduling in the time domain is slotted .",
    "denote by @xmath368 the time slot index .",
    "we define a scheduling frame consisting of @xmath369 slots .",
    "the channel state information is collected once per frame .",
    "define @xmath370 as user @xmath7 s average rate prior to slot @xmath368 , where parameter @xmath371 is the length of a time window ( in the number of time slots ) , and @xmath372 is user @xmath7 s instantaneous rate in slot @xmath373 @xcite . by proportional fairness , the weight of user @xmath7 in slot @xmath368 is set to @xmath374 , and for each slot , n- , noma - ftpc , and ofdma - ftpc with wsr utility maximization are performed once .",
    "suppose the average users rates are @xmath375 at the end of the scheduling period , and consider the jain s fairness index , computed as @xmath376 .",
    "this index , developed in @xcite , is widely used as a fairness measure for user throughput in communications networks .",
    "the value of this fairness index is between @xmath377 and @xmath378 .",
    "a higher value indicates fairer throughput distribution , and the maximum value of @xmath378 is reached if and only if all users achieve exactly the same throughput .",
    "note that the use of this index , by itself , does not prevent a user from being served with low throughput ( or even zero throughput ) , which , however , will most likely bring down the value of the index . in our case ,",
    "zero or very low throughput of any user is avoided by the fact that the weights in are set in accordance with proportionally fair scheduling .",
    "hence , over time , the weight of a user will increase to infinity , if the user keeps being allocated with zero throughput . for further insights of user throughput , particularly throughput of cell - edge users ,",
    "please see section  [ sec : edge ] .",
    "the fairness index in respect of @xmath0 and @xmath40 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pfuser ] and fig .",

    "the parameters are set to be @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pfuser ] and @xmath361 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pfm ] . for both figures ,",
    "we consider a scheduling period of @xmath379 time slots , with @xmath359 and @xmath380 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pfuser ] and [ fig : pfm ] , we observe that , first , the proposed n- achieves the best performance . moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : pfuser ] , increasing @xmath0 leads to fairness degradation in all schemes due to more competition among the users .    .",
    "]    . ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig : pfm ] , the fairness index increases in @xmath40 .",
    "this is because a larger @xmath40 provides more flexibility in resource allocation among the users .",
    "there is however a saturation effect , showing that the constraining impact due to limiting the number of multiplexed users per subcarrier decreases when the limit becomes large .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : srm ] , the improvement of throughput is marginal with @xmath40 becomes large . thus a moderate @xmath40 is justified not only by implementation complexity , but also that having a large @xmath40 may not lead to significant performance improvement .    in the two figures ,",
    "ofdma - ftpc gives the lowest fairness index .",
    "a particular reason is that the ftpc channel and power allocation scheme is sub - optimal .",
    "this also explains the improvement enabled by the proposed power optimization algorithm in comparison to noma - ftpc .",
    "we also remark that the vertical axis of the two figures starts from a positive value , hence the relative difference between the schemes in fairness is smaller than what it may appear to be .",
    "the performance of cell - edge users is of significance . to evaluate",
    ", we split the service area of the cell into an edge zone and a center zone .",
    "performance comparison is carried out for twenty - user instances with @xmath74 , @xmath359 , and 100 time slots . in the simulations , we deploy half of the users to the cell edge in each instance .",
    "each value in fig .",
    "[ fig : pfedge ] represents the average user rate over the entire scheduling period .",
    "we observe that using significantly improves the rates for cell - edge users . from the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : pfedge ] , the average rates of all cell - edge users in n- are much more than those of noma - ftpc and ofdma - ftpc .              the final part of our performance study is on characteristics of user grouping , i.e. , which users tend to be multiplexed together on the same subcarrier by optimization , we consider a scenario with @xmath74 , @xmath359 , @xmath361 , and apply n- to 1,000 realizations .",
    "for each subcarrier , we index the users in descending order of channel gain .",
    "if there are two users multiplexed on the subcarrier in the algorithm solution , we consider the difference of the two user indices .",
    "for example , if the users with the highest and lowest gains are grouped together , the difference is 19 .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : order ] , where the horizontal axis is the difference in index .    from the figure",
    ", we observe that users having large difference in channel gain are more likely to be multiplexed on the same subcarrier .",
    "this is coherent with the conclusion in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also evident by the figure that optimal assignment is not necessarily to select users with the best and poorest gains on a subcarrier .",
    "the observation motivates the treatment of subcarrier allocation as optimization variables .",
    "we have considered jointly optimizing power and channel allocation for noma .",
    "theoretical insights on complexity and optimality have been provided , and we have proposed an algorithm framework based on lagrangian dual optimization and dynamic programming .",
    "the proposed algorithm is capable of providing near - optimal solutions as well as bounding the global optimum tightly .",
    "numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithmic notions result in significant improvement of throughput and fairness in comparison to existing ofdma and noma schemes .",
    "an extension of the work is the consideration of max - min fairness for one scheduling instance . in this case",
    ", one solution approach is to perform a bi - section search . for each target level that represents the minimum throughput required for all users",
    ", the problem reduces to a feasibility test , i.e. , whether or not the target is achievable subject to the power limits .",
    "this can be formulated as to minimize the total power , with constraints specifying the throughput target value and user - individual power limits .",
