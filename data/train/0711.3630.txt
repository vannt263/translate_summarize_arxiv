    "bayesian methods of inference @xcite are playing an ever growing role in the statistical analysis of data in physics and other natural sciences @xcite . among its particular virtues",
    "is the ability to perform model selection , i.e. to quantitatively assess the appropriateness of a particular model irrespective of concrete parameter values .",
    "this is accomplished by calculating what is called the _ evidence _ or the _ prior - predictive value_.    building on rather general and essentially simple principles the efficiency of bayesian methods in practical applications depends crucially on the implemented numerical algorithms .",
    "a major difficulty common to bayesian data analysis is the calculation of integrals in high - dimensional spaces which are dominated by contributions from small and labyrinthine regions .",
    "similar problems are typical for the numerical determination of the partition function in statistical mechanics .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that some of the tools developed in statistical mechanics have found their way into the arsenal of methods used in bayesian inference .    in the present paper",
    "we show that recent progress in the statistical mechanics of non - equilibrium processes @xcite entails new possibilities to estimate the prior - predictive value and to average with the posterior distribution of a bayesian analysis .",
    "the new method relies on the monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation of a _ non - stationary _ markov process and is intermediate between straight mc sampling and thermodynamic integration @xcite .",
    "it is generally superior to the first and may also outperform the second .",
    "we first give a general theoretical discussion and then analyze numerically two simple examples .",
    "one of these was used already in @xcite to scrutinize the efficiency of thermodynamic integration .",
    "the second is a generalization thereof employing a bimodal likelihood .",
    "we consider a standard bayesian inference problem in which parameters @xmath0 of a model @xmath1 are to be determined from data @xmath2 .",
    "the prior information about @xmath0 is coded in a prior distribution @xmath3 , the likelihood of the data given certain values of @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath4 . by bayes theorem",
    "the posterior distribution is given by @xmath5 our central quantity of interest is the normalization of the posterior , the so called evidence or prior - predictive value , defined by @xmath6 it quantifies the likeliness of the data for the particular model @xmath1 under consideration and is therefore crucial for the comparison between different models . for the following manipulations the dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 on @xmath0 will be the important one , in order to lighten the notation we will therefore suppress the dependencies on @xmath2 and @xmath1 in these quantities . generically the integral in ( [ eq : defppv ] )",
    "is dominated by intricately shaped regions in a high - dimensional space and is therefore difficult to determine .",
    "a possible remedy for this problem is motivated by the method of thermodynamic integration used in statistical mechanics . to this end",
    "one introduces the auxiliary quantity @xmath7 clearly @xmath8 due to the normalization of the prior distribution and @xmath9 , the desired quantity .",
    "moreover @xmath10 where the @xmath11-average in the last line is taken with the distribution @xmath12 we therefore get @xmath13 from which the name thermodynamic integration for the method becomes clear .",
    "since averages are much more efficiently calculated from mc simulations than normalization factors ( [ eq : thdint ] ) offers a convenient way to determine @xmath14 from equilibrium simulations for just a few values of @xmath11 between 0 and 1 .",
    "the method was suggested in @xcite , its advantages over a straight - forward mc estimation of @xmath14 from ( [ eq : defppv ] ) was demonstrated for a simple test example in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the mc simulations necessary to implement ( [ eq : thdint ] ) in somewhat more detail .",
    "we first discretize the @xmath11-interval by introducing @xmath15 values @xmath16 , with @xmath17 . for each @xmath18",
    "we generate a trajectory @xmath19 with a discrete time @xmath20 measured in mc steps .",
    "these trajectories are realizations of a markov process with transition probability @xmath21 which leaves the distribution defined in ( [ eq : defpbeta ] ) invariant , i.e. which satisfies @xmath22 a sufficiently long markov chain is now generated for each @xmath18 in order to get a reliable estimate for @xmath23 to be used in ( [ eq : thdint ] ) .",
    "this equilibration of the system at each value of @xmath11 is the main bottleneck of the method . in realistic situations with a multi - modal or otherwise complicated structure of the likelihood",
    "it may become very slow and special care must be taken which elements of the trajectory @xmath19 to use for the estimation of the average @xmath23 . as a rule",
    "specific quantities need to be identified and monitored which indicate when the system has approximately equilibrated .",
    "these equilibration problems may be avoided by building on recent progress in the statistical mechanics of non - equilibrium processes @xcite . in the present context it gives rise to the following procedure to determine @xmath24 .",
    "we fix a time interval @xmath25 and generate a set of trajectories @xmath19 from a _ non - stationary _ markov process such that for each trajectory @xmath11 changes from 0 to 1 .",
    "more precisely we fix @xmath26 intermediate time points @xmath27 with @xmath28 at which @xmath11 changes by @xmath29 .",
    "we call the set @xmath30 of these time points and the corresponding increments in @xmath11 the _ protocol _ of the procedure .    consider a trajectory @xmath31 that starts in @xmath32 drawn from the prior distribution @xmath33 and then evolves according to @xmath21 with @xmath18 fixed by the protocol @xmath30 .",
    "the probability @xmath34 of the whole trajectory is given by @xmath35 consider now the trajectory dependent functional @xmath36 which is a random quantity due to its dependence on @xmath31 .",
    "we will show that its exponential average @xmath37 is equal to the desired quantity @xmath9 .    to this end",
    "we first note that the integrations over the first @xmath19 with @xmath38 are easily performed since during these time steps @xmath39 . using ( [ eq : inv ] ) repeatedly for @xmath40 we find @xmath41 together with the @xmath42 term in ( [ eq : defr ] ) and using ( [ eq : defpbeta ] ) as well as @xmath43 we hence obtain @xmath44 the integrations over the @xmath19 with @xmath45 can now be performed analogously .",
    "according to ( [ eq : inv ] ) we get at first @xmath46 since @xmath47 for the whole interval . together with the second term of the sum in ( [ eq : defr ] ) we hence have @xmath48 iterating this procedure we finally arrive at @xmath49 generalizing this relation to continuous protocols @xmath50 with @xmath51 we obtain @xmath52 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : res ] ) and ( [ eq : rescont ] ) are our central result .",
    "the prior - predictive value can be determined from an exponential average of the quantity @xmath53 defined in ( [ eq : defr ] ) over an ensemble of mc trajectories @xmath19 generated with a transition probability @xmath54 that depends explicitly on time via the protocol @xmath50 .",
    "note that this protocol must be the same for all trajectories @xmath31 that are used to determine the average @xmath55 .",
    "it is nevertheless very remarkable that the results ( [ eq : res ] ) and ( [ eq : rescont ] ) respectively do not depend on the details of this protocol .    as a small",
    "aside we note that in a bayesian analysis one is usually more interested in _ averages _ with the posterior distribution ( [ eq : postp ] ) than in this distribution itself . by a slight generalization of the above proof",
    "one can show for the posterior average of some function @xmath56 @xmath57 where the averages in the last line are taken with @xmath34 .",
    "posterior averages may hence be determined from path averages starting from the prior distribution and incorporating the weight factor @xmath58 , cf .",
    "@xcite for an analogous result in the statistical mechanics framework .",
    "two limiting cases of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : res ] ) and ( [ eq : rescont ] ) are of interest . for @xmath59",
    "the system is manipulated in quasi - equilibrium and @xmath11 and thus @xmath60 change very slowly .",
    "accordingly the markov chain will explore much of the state space for a given small @xmath11-interval and we may therefore replace @xmath61 in ( [ eq : defr ] ) by @xmath62 . as a consequence @xmath63 no longer depends on the individual realizations of the trajectories @xmath31 and the average in ( [ eq : rescont ] ) becomes superfluous .",
    "therefore @xmath64 which brings us back to thermodynamic integration , cf .",
    "( [ eq : thdint ] ) .    in the opposite limit @xmath11",
    "is changed in a single step from zero to one at some time @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 with the heaviside @xmath67-function being 1 for positive arguments and zero else . in this case",
    "the time integral in ( [ eq : rescont ] ) picks up contributions from @xmath65 only and the average over the trajectories @xmath31 reduces to the average over @xmath68 with the prior distribution @xmath33 .",
    "we then find from ( [ eq : rescont ] ) @xmath69 which is identical with ( [ eq : defppv ] ) .",
    "this limit is equivalent to what is called _ thermodynamic perturbation _ in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the proposed method hence interpolates between the two extreme variants ( [ eq : defppv ] ) and ( [ eq : thdint ] ) for the determination of the prior - predictive value @xmath14 .",
    "it should be superior to the straight application of ( [ eq : defppv ] ) since the average in ( [ eq : rescont ] ) is already shortly after the start of the trajectories influenced by the likelihood @xmath70 which is , as a rule , much sharper than the prior .",
    "it may outperform thermodynamic integration ( [ eq : thdint ] ) since no time - consuming equilibrations are necessary . on the other hand ,",
    "the exponential average in ( [ eq : rescont ] ) is known to be subtle .",
    "it is biased for finite sample sizes @xcite and dominated by rare realizations with very big values of @xmath63 for processes too far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a strong argument in favour of the method is its applicability to systems that are hard to equilibrate and its great flexibility to optimization for which the whole protocol @xmath50 is at our disposal .",
    "it is also worthwhile to mention that in many situations of interest the probability distribution of @xmath63 is gaussian with average @xmath71 and variance @xmath72 @xcite . in this case the average @xmath55 can be calculated exactly with the result @xmath73 the determination of @xmath74 and @xmath72 from the mc simulations is , of course , much less demanding than the extraction of the complete distribution of @xmath63 . for general distributions ( [ eq : cum ] ) gives just the first two terms of the cumulant expansion .",
    "we now numerically investigate the performance of the method by applying it to two simple , exactly solvable examples .",
    "the first one employs a unimodal likelihood the second one uses a bimodal one .",
    "these model systems are variants of those discussed in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the underlying inference problem is to estimate an @xmath75-dimensional vector @xmath0 of parameters from an @xmath75-dimensional vector @xmath2 of data with @xmath76 .    for the unimodal case both prior @xmath77 and likelihood @xmath78",
    "are taken to be gaussians with zero mean and variances @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "@xmath81 we will use @xmath82 and @xmath83 to model the typical situation in which the prior is substantially broader than the likelihood .",
    "moreover we choose a data vector @xmath2 with @xmath84 which on the one hand ensures that the data are far from the center of the prior @xmath85 , and on the other hand fixes the signal - to - noise ratio snr@xmath86 to be 10 as in @xcite .",
    "the performance of the algorithms to be discussed below does not depend on the particular values of the @xmath87 as long as @xmath88 is fulfilled .",
    "we therefore use the simple prescription @xmath89 for all @xmath90 .    in the bimodal case",
    "only the likelihood differs which is given by @xmath91 and hence consists of two gaussians with the same variance centered at @xmath0 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "it is important , however , that their relative weights are markedly different from each other .",
    "our special choice of parameters implies that in equilibrium the region around @xmath92 should be sampled @xmath93 times as often as the one around @xmath0 .    with the choices for prior and",
    "likelihood given above the prior - predictive value as defined in ( [ eq : defppv ] ) can be calculated analytically .",
    "we get for both cases the result @xmath94 with the parameter values chosen this yields @xmath95 .    in the following we will test thermodynamic integration and our procedure against the exact result . in order to present a fair comparison between the performances of the numerical methods",
    "each simulation will comprise the same number ( @xmath96 ) of mc steps .",
    "this number will , however , be divided in different ways between the number @xmath15 of intermediate @xmath11-values , the number @xmath97 of mc steps per @xmath11-value for thermodynamic integration , ( the number @xmath97 of mc steps per run for the exponential average ) , and the number @xmath98 of runs to estimate the distribution of @xmath63 , ( to estimate the distribution of @xmath99 ) .",
    "the thermodynamic integration scheme ( [ eq : thdint ] ) requires estimates of @xmath100 at appropriately chosen values @xmath18 of @xmath11 . as",
    "a rule @xmath23 is a smooth function of @xmath11 and few such values will be sufficient .",
    "trajectories @xmath31 are generated for each @xmath18 by the standard metropolis algorithm .",
    "first a starting point @xmath32 is chosen at random , e.g. from the prior distribution @xmath33 or taken directly from the endpoints at the previous @xmath18 .",

    "the choice @xmath107 ensures a good acceptance ratio for all @xmath11 since it adapts to the width of @xmath60 as given in ( [ eq : defpbeta ] ) .",
    "the first steps in the trajectories @xmath31 are not yet characteristic for the equilibrium distribution .",
    "we therefore discard the first @xmath108 of steps for equilibration .",
    "the rest is thinned out by discarding all but every tenth step to suppress correlations . from the remaining values",
    "the average @xmath109 is determined .",
    "we then calculate @xmath110 by integrating a cubic spline interpolation of ( [ eq : thdint ] ) . the procedure is repeated @xmath98 times to obtain an average of the log prior - predictive value , @xmath99 , together with an error estimate .    for the simulation of ( [ eq : rescont ] ) we have",

    "fourth , no equilibration is necessary and hence no points will be discarded .    at each moment when @xmath11 changes a new contribution is added to @xmath63 according to ( [ eq : defr ] ) .",
    "after @xmath98 trajectories have been simulated , a histogram of @xmath63-values is generated from which the average @xmath74 , the variance @xmath115 and the exponential average @xmath116 together with an error estimate are calculated .",

    "this makes sense : for simple situations without equilibration problems thermodynamics integration works fine and our more general method yields comparable results for protocols which are near to a quasi - static process .",

    "a comparison of the methods when applied to a more realistic setup with the complications alluded to in the introduction and when implemented in a more optimal way is left for future work .",
