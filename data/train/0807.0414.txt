    "the phenomenology of compact stars is intimately connected to the eos of matter at densities well beyond the nuclear saturation density , @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "compact stars are therefore natural laboratories for the exploration of baryonic matter under extreme conditions , complementary to those created in terrestrial experiments with atomic nuclei and heavy - ion collisions .",
    "recent results derived from observations of compact stars provide serious constraints on the nuclear eos , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a stiff eos at high density is needed to explain the high compact - star masses and radii , for which there is growing evidence from recent observations .",
    "a mass of @xmath6  m@xmath3 has been reported for some low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , _",
    "e.g. _ , 4u 1636 - 536 @xcite , based on the assumption that the abrupt drop in the coherence of the lower kilohertz quasiperiodic oscillation ( qpo ) may be related to the innermost stable circular orbit , see also @xcite . from observations of the bright isolated neutron star rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( shorthand : rx j1856 ) in the optical and x - ray frequency range , a conservative lower limit of the apparent neutron star radius of @xmath7 km",
    "is derived @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a true ( de - redshifted ) radius of @xmath8 km for a 1.4 m@xmath3 neutron star , or equivalently , to a star mass of at least 2.1 m@xmath3 when the radius does not exceed 12 km @xcite .",
    "another example is exo 0748 - 676 , an lmxb for which the compact - star mass _ and _ radius have been constrained to @xmath9  m@xmath3 and @xmath10  km @xcite by a simultaneous measurement of the eddington limit , the gravitational redshift , and the flux of thermal radiation .",
    "however , the status of the results for the latter object is unclear , because the gravitational redshift @xmath11 observed in the x - ray burst spectra @xcite has not been confirmed , despite numerous attempts .",
    "further constraints on the masses and radii of compact stars have been reported ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , but they deserve a careful discussion which is beyond the scope of the present paper . while compact - star phenomenology apparently points towards a stiff eos at high density , heavy - ion collision data for kaon production @xcite and elliptic flow @xcite set an upper limit on the stiffness of the eos @xcite .",
    "a key question regarding the structure of matter at high density is whether a phase transition to quark matter occurs inside compact stars , and whether it is accompanied by unambiguous observable signatures .",
    "it has been argued that the observation of a compact star with high mass and large radius , as reported for exo 0748 - 676 , would be incompatible with a quark core @xcite , because quark deconfinement softens the eos and lowers the maximum mass and corresponding radius .",
    "however , alford _",
    "et al . _ have demonstrated @xcite with a few counter examples that quark matter can not be excluded by this argument .",
    "in particular , for a recently developed hybrid star eos @xcite , based on the dbhf approach in the nuclear sector and a three - flavor chiral quark model @xcite , stable hybrid stars with masses ranging from 1.2 m@xmath3 to 2.1 m@xmath3 is obtained , in accordance with modern mass - radius constraints , see also @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a sufficiently low critical density for quark deconfinement has been achieved by a strong diquark coupling , while a repulsive vector meanfield in the quark matter sector resulted in sufficient stiffness to achieve a high maximum mass of the compact star sequence .",
    "the corresponding hybrid eos for symmetric matter was shown to fulfill the constraints derived from elliptic flow in heavy - ion collisions . in the present work",
    "we discuss a new scenario that comprises a sequential transition from nuclear matter to deconfined quark matter , which could play an important role in asymmetric matter , in particular for the phenomenology of compact stars .",
    "chiral quark models of njl type with dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking have the property that the symmetry is restored ( and quarks are deconfined ) separately for each flavor .",
    "when solving the gap and charge - neutrality equations self - consistently , the chiral - symmetry restoration for a given flavor occurs when the chemical potential of that flavor reaches a critical value that is approximately equal to the dynamically generated quark mass , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . in asymmetric matter",
    "the quark chemical potentials are different .",
    "consequently , the njl model behavior suggests that the critical density of deconfinement is flavor dependent , see fig .",
    "[ f : mucrit ] .    in this scenario",
    "the down quark flavor is the first to drip out of nucleons when the density increases , followed by the up quark flavor and eventually also by strange quarks .",
    "this behavior is absent in simple and commonly applied bag - model equations of state , because they are essentially flavor blind .    under the @xmath1-equilibrium condition in compact stars",
    "the chemical potentials of quarks and electrons are related by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the mass difference between the strange and the light quark flavors @xmath16 has two consequences : 1 ) the down and strange quark densities are different , so charge neutrality requires a finite electron density and , consequently , 2 ) @xmath17 . when increasing the baryochemical potential the d - quark chemical potential is therefore the first to reach the critical value , @xmath18 , where the chiral symmetry gets ( approximately ) restored in a first - order transition and deconfined d - quarks appear . due to the finite value of @xmath19",
    "the u - quark chemical potential is still below @xmath20 , while the s - quark density is zero due to the high s - quark mass .",
    "a _ single - flavor _ d - quark phase therefore forms in co - existence with the positively charged nuclear - matter medium .",
    "why has this interesting scenario been left unnoticed ?",
    "one reason is that bag models , which are commonly used to describe quark matter in compact star interiors can not address sequential deconfinement .",
    "another reason is that the single - flavor d - quark phase is negatively charged and can not be neutralized with leptons .",
    "it was therefore disregarded in dynamical approaches like njl models which in practice are used mainly to describe the deconfined and `` pure '' quark matter phase only . in the following we discuss the single - flavor phase for the first time , under the natural assumption that the neutralizing background is nuclear matter . since nucleons are bound states of quarks , a mixed phase of nucleons and free d - quarks could naturally arise when nucleonic bound states dissociate ( mott effect ) .",
    "the task to develop a unified description of the phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter on the quark level , as a dissociation of three - quark bound states into their constituents in the spirit of a mott transition has not yet been solved .",
    "only some aspects have been studied within a nonrelativistic potential model @xcite and within the njl model @xcite . here",
    "we consider a chemical equilibrium reaction on the form @xmath21 , which results in a mixed phase of nucleons and down quarks once the d - quark chemical potential exceeds the critical value .",
    "this scenario is analogous to the dissociation of nuclear clusters in the crust of neutron stars ( neutron dripline ) and the effect may therefore be called the _ d - quark dripline_. we approximate the quark and nucleon components as subphases , which are described by separate models .",
    "for the nuclear matter subphase we use two alternatives : 1 ) the dbhf approach @xcite with the relativistic bonn  a potential , where the nucleon self - energies are based on a t - matrix obtained from the bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation .",
    "2 ) the eos by shen _",
    "@xcite , which is based on relativistic mean - field theory and includes the contribution of heavy nuclei , described within the thomas - fermi approximation . despite its drawbacks",
    "this eos is instructive since it is available for a large enough range of densities , temperatures and isospin asymmetries that it qualifies for applications in studies of supernova collapse and protoneutron star evolution . only very recently",
    ", significant progress could be made , e.g. , in generalizing the nuclear statistical equilibrium approach @xcite and in implementing a quantum statistical description for cluster formation and dissociation ( mott effect ) @xcite .",
    "the quark matter phase is described within a three - flavor njl - type model , which includes diquark pairing channels @xcite .",
    "this approach is justified since the @xmath22 domain of the qcd phase diagram is rather poorly understood .",
    "a more fundamental approach , like solving the in - medium qcd schwinger - dyson equations in a concrete qcd model @xcite is demanding and is therefore beyond scope of this work .",

    "a mixture of one - flavor and two - flavor quark matter is favored .",
    "the strange flavor occurs at still higher densities .",
    "note that the 2sc phase can not persist at high @xmath41 since the large difference in the fermi levels of @xmath42 and @xmath43 quarks prevents their pairing and the two - flavor quark matter is therefore in the normal phase ( nq ) .    using the hybrid eos we calculate compact - star sequences by solving the oppenheimer - volkoff equations for hydrostatic equilibrium .",

    "the matrix element vanishes with the consequence that the direct urca process does not occur , and also the bulk viscosity is zero .",
    "however , in the mixed nuclear+csl phase there could be important friction and pair - breaking / formation processes , which we have not yet studied in detail .",

    "superbursts are rare , puzzling phenomena observed as a extremely long ( 4 - 14 hours ) and energetic ( @xmath51 ) type - i x - ray bursts from lmxbs . they take place if the accreted hydrogen and helium at the surface burns in an unstable manner , which is the normal case @xcite . as suggested in @xcite superbursts could originate from accreting strange stars with a thin crust and a core of three - flavor quark matter in the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase .",
    "the suppression of the neutrino emissivity and heat conductivity in the cfl phase @xcite , caused by pairing gaps that affect all flavors , is of particular importance in this superburst scenario . following cumming et al .",
    "@xcite the underlying mechanism is unstable thermonuclear burning of carbon in the crust , at column depths of about @xmath52 .",
    "carbon is a remnant of accreted hydrogen and helium at the surface",
    ". observed superburst light curves suggest that the burning takes place at a depth where the crust reaches temperatures of about @xmath53 k and column depths of about @xmath54 .",
    "such high temperatures in the crust at a certain depth are caused by deep crustal heating @xcite .",
    "the important ingredients for the strange - star model of superbursts @xcite are a thin baryonic crust of thickness 100 to 400  m , an energy release of 1 to 100 mev per accreted nucleon by conversion into strange matter , a suppression of the fast direct urca neutrino emissivity to the order of @xmath55 , and a thermal conductivity , @xmath56 , of quark matter in the range @xmath57 .",

    "the mixed phase of d - csl quark matter with nuclear matter extends up to the crust - core boundary .",
    "[ f : profile],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ f : profile ] we show that d - csl quark matter ( in the mixed phase with nuclear matter ) extends up to the crust - core boundary , as strange quark matter does in the case of strange stars .",
    "one of the main arguments for strange matter in the context of a superburst mechanism is the fact that superconducting phases , like the cfl phase , can suppress fast neutrino emission processes of all quark flavors and are able to fulfill the fusion ignition condition .",
    "this is the case also for the single - flavor csl phase . as we have shown above the fast direct urca process",
    "is not possible at all in this phase , while slow neutrino cooling processes like bremsstrahlung of electrons and d - quarks exist .",
    "we want to estimate the order of magnitude of the energy release @xmath59 due to partial conversion of ordinary nuclear matter to dbhf+csl hybrid matter at the crust - core boundary .",
    "as we apply the gibbs construction of a phase transition a density dependent volume fraction of the d - quark admixture in the nuclear + csl phase results , varying from zero to unity .",
    "the caveat of this construction is that all thermodynamical quantities at the onset of the phase transition vary continuously .",
    "however , in reality an infinitesimally small fraction of the d - quark subphase would imply that large residual color forces between d - quarks should occur .",
    "therefore , a solution of the phase admixture problem with a finite jump of the d - quark admixture at the onset of the tranistion should be energetically favored . at the present stage of our work",
    "we can not quantify this statement due to the absence of confining forces between color charges in our quark matter model .",
    "an estimate which we would suggest here is to determine the fraction @xmath60 of dcsl matter at the d - quark dripline in the vicinity of the crust - core boundary .",
    "then one multiplies the change in energy per baryon due to the process @xmath61 with @xmath60 as an estimate for the probablility of this process to occur per accreted nucleon . a rough estimate ( see fig .  [",
    "f : profile ] ) gives @xmath62 which for a jump of the d - quark mass gap by @xmath63 mev ( see fig .",
    "[ f : gaps ] ) at the chiral transition ( d - quark dripline ) results in @xmath64 [ mev]@xmath65 mev .",
    "this meets well the estimated range @xmath66  mev @xcite and could thus , in principle , explain burst ignition at appropriate depths for a suitable value of @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , a strange matter core is not necessarily needed to resolve the superburst puzzle , because a hybrid - star model with quark matter in the d - csl phase could have similar properties .",
    "@xcite show that deep crustal heating mechanisms at the crust - core boundary , _",
    "e.g. _ , conversion of baryonic matter to strange quark matter , which can fulfill the constraints of the superburst scenario provide a consistent explanation also for the cooling of soft x - ray transients . along the lines of this argument",
    ", we suggest that the d - quark drip effect , which leads to a mixture of nuclear matter with single - flavor quark matter in the csl phase , can serve as a deep crustal heating mechanism .",
    "superbursts and the cooling of x - ray transients are not only consistent with quark matter in compact stars but may qualify as a signature for its occurrence !",
    "in this paper we suggest a new quark - nuclear hybrid model for compact star applications that fulfills modern constraints from observations of compact stars . due to isospin",
    "asymmetry , down - quarks may `` drip out '' from nucleons and form a single - flavor color superconducting ( csl ) phase that is mixed with nuclear matter already at the crust - core boundary in compact stars .",
    "the csl phase has interesting cooling and transport properties that are in accordance with constraints from the thermal and rotational evolution of compact stars @xcite .",
    "it remains to be investigated whether this new compact star composition could lead to unambiguous observational consequences , and whether it is thermodynamically favored also when effects like coulomb screening and surface tension are accounted for .",
    "we conjecture that the d - quark drip may serve as an effective deep crustal heating mechanism for the explanation of the puzzling superburst phenomenon and the cooling of x - ray transients .",

    "<S> we suggest a scenario where the three light quark flavors are sequentially deconfined under increasing pressure in cold asymmetric nuclear matter as found , e.g. , in neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> the basis for our analysis is a chiral quark matter model of nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) type with diquark pairing in the spin-1 single flavor ( csl ) , spin-0 two flavor ( 2sc ) and three flavor ( cfl ) channels . </S>",
    "<S> we find that nucleon dissociation sets in at about the saturation density , @xmath0 , when the down - quark fermi sea is populated ( d - quark dripline ) due to the flavor asymmetry induced by @xmath1-equilibrium and charge neutrality . at about @xmath2 u - quarks appear and a two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase is formed . </S>",
    "<S> the s - quark fermi sea is populated only at still higher baryon density , when the quark chemical potential is of the order of the dynamically generated strange quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> we construct two different hybrid equations of state ( eos ) using the dirac - brueckner hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach and the eos by shen _ </S>",

    "<S> the corresponding hybrid star sequences have maximum masses of , respectively , 2.1 and 2.0 m@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> two- and three - flavor quark - matter phases exist only in gravitationally unstable hybrid star solutions in the dbhf case , while the shen - based eos produce stable configurations with a 2sc phase - component in the core of massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> nucleon dissociation via d - quark drip could act as a deep crustal heating process , which apparently is required to explain superbusts and cooling of x - ray transients . </S>"
