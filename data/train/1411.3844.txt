    "following pioneering work in the late 1960 s @xcite , a paradigm has gradually emerged in which central massive black holes ( cmbh ) have come to be regarded as an integral component of `` most , if not all , massive galaxies , '' intimately linked to their formation and evolution @xcite . however , despite a great deal of research and progress on many fronts towards a better understanding of this paradigm , essentially all of the fundamental questions concerning the formation , growth , and host co - evolution of cmbh remain unanswered .",
    "one such question , which forms the focal point of this article , is the question of whether cmbh are generic to all galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note , that while it is often stated in the literature that black holes are to be found at the centers of most galaxies , until recently there has been insufficient evidence to support this claim , even for the case of massive galaxies not possessing a significant bulge component , let alone the general population , most of which are not massive . in other words , it is not generally known whether cmbh are only a generic feature of certain galaxy types , or present only in galaxies above a certain mass threshold , or subject to a combination of both of these restrictions .",
    "the question of cmbh genericity is strongly related to the issues of formation , growth and galaxy co - evolution .",
    "its relationship with the subject of galaxy formation can be understood by considering the current observational constraints on high - redshift quasars , which imply that cmbh were present at very early times and must have , therefore , either formed concurrently with their host galaxies or prior to them ( e.  g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while these constraints clearly highlight the close connection between the formation of cmbh and their hosts , they also conversely imply that galaxies which do not host a cmbh will likely have undergone distinct formation process .",
    "similarly , in order to understand the link between cmbh genericity and evolution , one need only consider the evidence of the significant effects that agn have on their host s evolution @xcite in order to realise that galaxies which do not host cmbh may have undergone a markedly different evolution from those that do .",
    "it is apparent from these simple observations that the question of cmbh genericity has important implications for the theory and modelling of galaxy and large scale structure evolution ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "indeed , the importance of modelling agn feedback has been understood for some time @xcite and various approaches are now incorporated as standard in simulations of galaxy and structure evolution @xcite , see also @xcite for a comparison of models .",
    "in general , it is expected that theories and models which assume that black holes are generic will differ significantly in their predictions from those that do nt . for example , while most models and simulations at present include the effects of agn feedback from massive galaxies , including the effects of agn feedback from low - mass galaxies may account for the observed low baryon fraction in milky way type galaxies at the present epoch , e.  g. , see @xcite .    while the broad question of the genericity of cmbh remains open , recent findings have been strongly supportive of cmbh being generic for the subset of massive galaxies , i.  e.  for galaxies with stellar masses above @xmath4 m@xmath2 . in particular , in recent work @xcite studied a sample of 15  991  galaxies and found the fraction of galaxies containing a cmbh to be approximately the same for each morphological type .",
    "this study was itself prompted by the recent discovery of cmbh in galaxies lacking any substantial spheroidal component @xcite .",
    "prior to this there was only strong evidence for the generic presence of cmbh in galaxies with a significant bulge component @xcite . while evidence continues to accrue to firmly establish the generic existence of cmbh within massive galaxies ,",
    "attention has now begun to shift to the question of whether cmbh are also generic in the low - mass regime , i.  e.  in galaxies with stellar masses below @xmath4 m@xmath2 , or in other words , on whether cmbh are generic to dwarf galaxies .    until very recently it was not even known whether any dwarf galaxies contained cmbh , let alone whether they were generic . however , during the last few years results in this area have been rapid and it is now known that a significant number of galaxies with masses @xmath5 m@xmath2 , i.  e.  at the high end of the dwarf galaxy mass regime and the low end of the massive galaxy regime , do contain active cmbh . in particular , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have detected the optical signatures of mainly unobscured ( type  1 ) agn in 768 galaxies with total stellar masses in the range @xmath6 m@xmath2 , while @xcite have detected the infrared signatures of both obscured and unobscured agn in 73 dwarf galaxies with masses in the range @xmath7 m@xmath2 .",
    "even though these findings are encouraging , they barely probe the dwarf galaxy mass range , and it is also the case that the black hole masses derived from the optical spectra are subject to large systematic uncertainties .",
    "additionally , one would ideally also like to have dynamical derived masses . at the present time there are no dynamical measurements of black holes in galaxies classified as dwarf galaxies with stellar masses below @xmath4 m@xmath2",
    ". however , recently , @xcite found a black hole of mass @xmath8 m@xmath2 in an ultra - compact dwarf galaxy m60-ucd1 of total stellar mass @xmath9 m@xmath2 , though this is believed to be a tidally stripped galaxy who s progenitor had a mass of @xmath10 m@xmath2 , which would then be consistent with the known black hole mass to host total stellar mass scaling relation @xcite .",
    "as dwarf galaxies exhibit a number of properties that differentiate them from other galaxies ( see review in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are known to have different evolutionary histories from massive galaxies , this could be a consequence of them not having cmbh , or of having a different relationship with their cmbh . if it is the case that dwarf galaxies generically contain cmbh , it is therefore not necessarily the case that what has been learned about the relationships between cmbh and their hosts in the massive regime , as exhibited in their scaling relations , will necessarily hold for dwarf galaxies . finally ,",
    "because dwarf galaxies have on average low surface brightness , this necessitates studying nearby objects .",
    "consequently this provides the opportunity to discover nearby low mass cmbh , with masses @xmath11 m@xmath2 .",
    "motivated by our recent infrared ( ir ) study of active massive black holes in galaxies of all morphological types and wide range of stellar masses , we have undertaken a census in the very nearby universe , targeting specifically low - mass dwarf systems with bh masses in the imbhs mass range ( @xmath12 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : sample ] , we describe our nearby and dwarf galaxies sample . in section  [ sec : ircolor ] and [ sec : iragn ] , this sample is matched to an infrared catalogue and the agn candidates are identified using the infrared color diagnostic .",
    "the optical signature of these agn candidates are explored via the diagnostic line - intensity ratios in section  [ sec : bptdiag ] and their distance distribution is presented in section  [ sec : distance ] . in section  [ sec : mstar ] and [ sec : agnfraction ] , we derive stellar masses for the host galaxies of our agn candidates and compute the agn fraction as a function of stellar mass based on our agn selection method . in section  [ sec : bhmass ] and",
    "[ sec : relation ] , we evaluate the black hole masses for our agn candidates , present the black hole mass versus stellar mass scaling relation , and compare our black hole mass estimates to those derived using other methods . in section  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results .",
    "we believe that by firmly establishing the presence of active imbhs not only at the low end of the galaxy mass function but also in the nearby universe , it will be possible to follow - up their quiet counterparts with dynamical studies and hence provide further support for their existence .",
    "in order to initiate our study of black holes in dwarf galaxies , we first selected a sample of nearby galaxies .",
    "our primary sources were the updated nearby galaxy catalogue of @xcite and the catalogue of local group ( lg ) galaxies of @xcite .",
    "the first is a recently updated all - sky catalogue containing 869 nearby galaxies with distance estimates within 11 mpc or corrected radial velocities less than 600 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the latter contains all known galaxies with distances determined from measurements of resolved stellar populations that place them within 3  mpc of the sun .",
    "we also searched the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) under the following three classifications : dwarfs ( dwarf , nucleated , dwarf elliptical ( de ) , dwarf lenticular ( s0 ) , dwarf spiral ( ds ) , dwarf irregular ( di ) and blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) ) , e peculiar and compact e. initially , no stellar mass cut was applied to the sample .",
    "this primary sample was augmented by the sample of dwarf galaxies that had already been identified with having the _ optical spectroscopic _ signature of agn activity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mrbgd ) . the final list , cleaned of all duplications , consisted of a total of 5907 galaxies .",
    "in our analysis , we used mid - infrared colors to identify agn in our sample .",
    "one advantage of using images in the mid - infrared is that it allows one to detect both unobscured ( type  1 ) and obscured ( type  2 ) agn .",
    "the mid - infrared selection of unobscured agn relies upon distinguishing the approximately power - law agn spectrum from the black body stellar spectrum of galaxies ( which peaks at rest - frame 1.6 ; * ? ? ? * figure 3 ) using its red mid - infrared colors . as dust emission peaks in the infrared ,",
    "the obscured agn will simply have redder mid - infrared colors . in this regard , it is important to note that most surveys of agn in dwarf galaxies that have previously been undertaken have been carried out in the optical . therefore , optical studies are biased towards observing mainly only type  1 agn , even though the unified agn model @xcite predicts that type  1 agn should outnumber type  2 by a factor of @xmath143 ( e.  g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another advantage to working with mid - infrared data is that they allow agn to be easily distinguished from stars and galaxies .",
    "the infrared magnitudes of our galaxies were obtained from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) all - sky release source catalog .",
    "this catalog contains positions and photometry at 3.4 ( w1 ) , 4.6 ( w2 ) , 12 ( w3 ) and 22 ( w4 ) micron for 563,921,584 point - like and resolved objects detected on the atlas intensity images .",
    "the photometry in this catalogue was performed using point source profile - fitting and multi - aperture photometry and the estimated sensitivities are 0.068 , 0.098 , 0.86 and 5.4 mjy ( 5@xmath15 ) at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 micron in unconfused regions on the ecliptic plane .",
    "j2000 positions and uncertainties were reconstructed using the 2mass point source catalog as astrometric reference .",
    "astrometric accuracy is approximately 0.2 arcsec root - mean - square on each axis with respect to the 2mass reference frame for sources with signal - to - noise ratio greater than forty",
    ".    we cross - matched our nearby galaxy catalogue with the wise all - sky release source catalog using the us virtual astronomical observatory ( vao ) cross - comparison tool . using a matching radius of 6 arcseconds ,",
    "corresponding to the resolution of wise in w1 , we obtained 5056 matches .",
    "for each of the galaxies , wise photometry for w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 was gathered and a signal - to - noise ( snr ) cut of 3 was imposed on the first three bands , since only these three bands are needed for the agn diagnostic diagram and to obtain an estimate of the bh mass ( see section  [ sec : bhmass ] ) . using the three photometric bands ,",
    "two photometric colors were determined . in figure",
    "[ fig : wisecolor ] , we plot the @xmath16 versus @xmath17 color for the 3339 galaxies in our final snr@xmath18 wise matched sample .",
    "there are several mid - infrared color diagnostics that have been employed in the literature to select agn , starting with the `` lacy wedge '' @xcite",
    ". for low redshift galaxies ( i.  e.  @xmath19 ) , which applies to our sample of nearby galaxies , @xcite show that wise is able to robustly identify agn using the more sensitive w1 ( 3.4 micron ) and w2 ( 4.6 micron ) bands alone .",
    "@xcite show that a color cuts of @xmath20 , 0.7 , 0.6 , and 0.5 is able to identify agn with a reliability of 95% , 85% , 70% and 50% , respectively ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "note that although reliability drops with lower color cut , completeness increases , reaching the 95% level for @xmath21 . as can be seen in their figure 2",
    ", even the least stringent color cut of @xmath21 identifies galaxies in which the agn fraction is @xmath22% to @xmath23 ( note that this fraction changes depending on extinction ) .",
    "this means that this color cut only identifies agn that dominate the emission from their host galaxies . for galaxies in which the agn do not dominate over the host galaxy emission , dilution of the mid - infrared agn continuum by the host galaxy light can cause bluer @xmath16 colors that become indistinguishable from star - forming galaxies .",
    "in fact , as will be shown in section  [ sec : bptdiag ] , a large fraction of the optically identified agn in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dwarf galaxy sample of mrbgd have @xmath16 colors below this cutoff . in our analysis",
    ", we use the least stringent color cut of @xmath21 .",
    "one exception to this color cut is the case of low metallicity and extremely dusty bcds , which can be found at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the optical line diagnostics of these objects strongly suggests that the dominant mechanisms for the emission of these lines is star formation and not agn activity .",

    "we identify 48 candidate agn in our nearby galaxy sample .",
    "after visual inspection of the 48 wise images , we conservatively removed two candidates that were found close to an image artifact that could possibly contaminate the source and give an erroneous photometry , reducing the number to 46 .",

    "the optical and wise color images of our final 45 nearby galaxy agn candidates are shown in figure  [ fig : postagestamps ] and listed in table  [ tbl : tbl-1 ] .",
    "of these , a literature search revealed that 15 had previously been identified as hosting an agn .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : wisecolor ] , left , are the dwarf galaxies that already have been identified with having the optical spectroscopic signature of agn activity ( mrbgd ) .",
    "we find that 267 of these are also above our ir color cut . by splitting them into type  1 ( broad - line , hereafter bl ) and type  2 ( narrow - line , hereafter nl )",
    ", we can see that type  1 agn appear on average to have redder @xmath16 ir colors and lie preferentially above the ir cutoff , as compared to the type  2 agn which lie preferentially below .",

    "bcds are small , gas rich galaxies that are currently in a period of enhanced star formation .",
    "these galaxies are characterized by their blue color , low metallicity and compact size .",
    "some are extremely dusty @xcite ( _ magenta circles _ found in the top left corner of figure  [ fig : wisecolor ] , right ) and appear to be dominated by star formation .",
    "others , like mrk  709  s ( red circle in figure  [ fig : wisecolor ] , right ) , have x - ray and radio emission indicative of agn activity @xcite .",
    "the wise colors of mrk  709  s are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , therefore , falling just below our color cut .",
    "the fact that some of the bcds do have signs of bh activity indicates that the red colors may not be solely due to star formation in all cases .",
    "we explored the distribution of our sample of 3339 galaxies with wise matches and snr@xmath18 in @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the diagnostic diagrams of narrow - line ratios , which are a powerful tool to separate seyfert galaxies , low - ionization nuclear emission - line region sources , and hii galaxies @xcite .",
    "diagnostic line - intensity ratios , such as [ oiii]/h@xmath35 and [ nii]/h@xmath36 , corrected for reddening , are effective at separating populations with different ionization sources .",
    "the ionizing radiation field found in active galaxies is harder than in star - forming galaxies , and this gives higher values of [ nii]/h@xmath36 and [ oiii]/h@xmath35 .",
    "hence , the narrow line agn are found in the upper right portion of the [ oiii]/h@xmath35 versus [ nii]/h@xmath36 diagnostic diagram .",
    "the lines in these ratios are also selected to be close in wavelength space in order to minimize the effect of dust extinction on the computed line ratios .",
    "we obtained emission line fluxes and stellar mass estimates for our sample from the max planck institute for astrophysics / johns hopkins university ( mph / jhu ) collaboration , containing 927552 sdss galaxies .",
    "of the 971 matches , we found that 957 ( nine in our nearby galaxy sample ) had all four [ oiii ] , h@xmath35 , [ nii ] , and h@xmath36 line fluxes and we were therefore able to compute the line - intensity ratios shown in figure  [ fig : bpt ] , left .",
    "as in figure  [ fig : wisecolor ] , left , our nearby galaxies are shown as _ red triangles _ and the sample of dwarf galaxies that already have been identified with having the optical spectroscopic signature of agn activity ( mrbgd ) are shown as _ black open triangles_. these additional optically identified agn are split into type  1 ( bl ; _ green triangles _ ) and type  2 ( nl ; _ blue triangles _ ) . the _ dashed line _ is the demarcation line between normal star forming galaxies and agn from @xcite .            as expected , the majority of the optically classified agn are located in the conventional region of seyfert galaxies , in terms of the semi - empirical demarcation line of @xcite ( the _ dashed line _ in figure  [ fig : bpt ] , left ) in the [ oiii]/h@xmath35 versus [ nii]/h@xmath36 diagram .",
    "this also includes four objects in our nearby galaxy sample ( red triangles in figure  [ fig : bpt ] , left ) .",
    "the remaining one - third of the objects ( five in our nearby galaxy sample ) are located in the region for hii galaxies in the same diagram .",
    "this , at first , may look surprising but , as is reported in @xcite , may be explained by the possible inclusion in the sdss fiber aperture of emission from star formation regions in the host galaxies .",
    "hence , although the optical spectra undeniably reveal the presence of a broad - line agn , the narrow - line ratios may still be dominated by the characteristic emission of an hii region .",
    "note also that mrk  709  s ( red circle in figure  [ fig : bpt ] , right ) , which has x - ray and radio emission indicative of agn activity @xcite , is located very close to the demarcation line .",
    "one of the main goals of this study was to identify the closest dwarf galaxy hosting an agn .",
    "hundreds of active massive black holes have already been detected at the centers of low - mass galaxies ( e.  g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the major limitation of these works , however , is that they do not provide an unambiguous confirmation of the existence of these imbhs as they rely solely on detecting the radiative signatures of agn .",
    "moreover , the dwarf galaxies in these existing samples are too far away to carry out dynamical studies ( e.  g. , the * ? ? ?",
    "* sample has a redshift range of @xmath37 ) .",
    "hence , it follows that in order to firmly establish that massive black holes do indeed exist at the centers of dwarf galaxies , it is absolutely necessary to extend our search to the very nearby universe , i.  e.  to the galaxies for which we can resolve the sphere of influence of the cmbh and obtain dynamical mass estimates .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hist_dist ] we show the distance distribution of our sample of 310 agn candidates with known redshift / distance .",
    "the sample of 41 galaxies selected via the ir diagnostic , shown in red , _ contains the nearest agn candidates known today_. below 11 mpc , we find eleven agn candidates , including ngc  4395 ( 4.5 mpc ) which has been until now the closest one identified in a dwarf galaxy .",
    "our method detected agn in five galaxies that are closer than ngc  4395 : hipass  j1247 - 77 ( 3.2  mpc ) , ugc  04459 ( 3.2  mpc ) , ngc  5253 ( 3.6  mpc ) , ic  2574 ( 3.8  mpc ) and circinus ( 4.2  mpc ) .",
    "one of these , ngc  5253 , is a dwarf galaxy with stellar mass of @xmath38 m@xmath2 ( see table  [ tbl : tbl-1 ] ) , while three others have bh mass estimates indicative of a dwarf galaxy ( see section  [ sec : bhmass ] ) . in the context of being able to follow - up and confirm the presence of a imbh in a dwarf galaxy with dynamical measurement",
    ", this implies that nearby dwarf galaxies should be targeted for dynamical observations .",
    "we are interested in determining if low - mass galaxies harbor a cmbh , and if so , whether or not the correlation between bh mass and total stellar mass derived in @xcite extends to the low - mass regime .",
    "therefore , we calculated stellar masses for our nearby galaxy sample to both include a wide range of masses in our analysis and identify the particular sub - sample of low - mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "we used a combination of three independent methods to estimate the stellar masses of the 310 out of 313 galaxies with redshift measurement . the first method consisted of fitting the seds of our galaxies , consisting of sdss photometry , using magphys @xcite .",
    "we also estimated the stellar masses following the method of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their equation 8) .",
    "this method combines a galaxy s luminosity ( @xmath39 expressed in the ab system ) with a mass - to - light ratio derived from a color measurement ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we transformed the sdss magnitudes into ab mag , applied @xmath41-corrections using the method of @xcite , which , for the low - redshift ( @xmath42 ) galaxies in our sample , typically affect the @xmath43 and @xmath44 values by a few hundreths of a magnitude .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath39 was computed using the distances given in table  [ tbl : tbl-1 ] .",
    "this method only applies for galaxies with @xmath45 ( 307 of the 310 galaxies , all higher redshift sources being in the mrbgd sample ) .",
    "the third method consisted of using the @xmath46-band magnitude taken from both the psc and the xsc of 2mass .",
    "a general calibration factor was applied to the @xmath46 fluxes by comparing the stellar masses to the sed derived stellar masses .",
    "we compared the stellar masses measured from our three methods with those listed in the mpa / jhu and @xcite catalogues and those found in the literature .",
    "for the 274 galaxies with stellar masses from both the sed fit and the color measurement method , we found in general very good agreement between the two estimates , with only a few exceptions wherein the color measurement method appeared to underestimate the stellar mass with respect to the sed fit stellar mass .",
    "we find excellent agreement between our sed fit stellar masses and those of the mpa / jhu and @xcite catalogues which confirms that our sed fit stellar mass estimates are robust .",
    "we also find in general good agreement between the sed fit stellar masses and the few stellar masses which were reported by mrbgd .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : hist_mstarsed ] , we sample evenly a broad distribution of stellar masses , including dwarf galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath47 m@xmath2 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , dwarf galaxies exhibit many properties that distinguish them from massive galaxies ( e.  g. , mass - to - light ratios , star formation histories , metallicities ) and questions exist about the nature of their evolution with respect to massive galaxies . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting to consider whether agn have evolved differently in dwarf galaxies than in massive galaxies . a measure of this is given by the agn fraction at a given time and mass .",
    "starting from the mpa / jhu catalogue of galaxies with stellar masses and from the catalogue of @xcite , we examine the fraction of wise matches and ir - selected agn as a function of stellar mass in each of these samples .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : agnfraction ] , the fraction of ir - selected agn shows a signature bump at a stellar mass @xmath48 m@xmath2 .",
    "also , the fraction of agn appears to increase as a function of decreasing stellar mass at stellar masses below @xmath49 m@xmath2 , i.  e.  in the low - mass regime of dwarf galaxies , an effect reported also in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 5 ) .",
    "note , however , as can also be seen in the figure , this increase is accompanied with an increase in the wise fraction .",
    "this is not the case for the bump seen at @xmath50 m@xmath2 , which is displaced from the peak in the wise fraction .",
    "if real , this behavior at low mass could be due to : 1 ) the fact that bh activity is higher in nearby dwarf galaxies than in their more massive counterparts ( similarly to the star forming activity , i.  e.  the `` downsizing '' effect ) , or 2 ) the fact that it is easier to detect wise sources / agn in nearby low - mass ( low surface brightness ) galaxies . either way ,",
    "this is a result that should be further explored and confirmed .",
    "black hole masses were estimated using the bolometric luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "bolometric luminosities , taken to be the 100 micron to 10 kev integrated luminosity @xcite , are typically obtained using corrections to the mid - infrared bands where the agn emission dominates .",
    "we used the 12 ( w3 ) and 22 micron ( w4 ) k - corrected flux densities from wise to compute the bolometric luminosities of our wise color - selected agn , and applied the bolometric corrections @xmath51 ( w3 ) and @xmath52 ( w4 ) from @xcite , which are not strongly dependent on agn luminosity ( see their figure  12 ) .",
    "however , note that @xcite only considered type  1 ( bl ) agn in their analysis so that applying these corrections to type  2 agn may lead to additional uncertainties in the bh mass estimates .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of an agn can also be estimated using the [ o iii ]  @xmath535007 emission line luminosity ( e.  g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , in this method the bolometric correction is very uncertain , ranging from a factor of a hundred ( @xmath54 ) @xcite to a factor of ten ( @xmath55 ) @xcite larger than the ir bolometric correction . given the bolometric luminosity derived from the ir , making the assumption that accretion is at the eddington limit yields a lower limit on the black hole mass .",
    "however , given that the growth rates of agn can span several orders of magnitude , from super - eddington accretion to @xmath56 @xcite , we computed black hole masses assuming the following three cases : @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the histogram of bh masses computed using @xmath60 is shown in figure  [ fig : hist_mstarsed ] , right .",
    "this choice of @xmath61 is taken from @xcite and appears to also be a good fit to this data set ( see section  [ sec : relation ] ) .",
    "the black hole masses associated with the dwarf galaxies range from @xmath62 m@xmath2 ( see also section  [ sec : relation ] ) , which is a significantly lower ranged than has previously been probed .",
    "using the stellar masses and the black hole masses estimated from the bolometric luminosity of the galaxies , we present in figure  [ fig : mstar_bhmass ] , left , the correlation between black hole mass and total sed stellar mass for our sample of 277 galaxies . here",
    ", we only show the bh mass estimates based on the 12 micron luminosities , as the snr of the wise data is higher than in the 22 micron images .",
    "we find active bh in nearby dwarfs , as well as _ in dwarf galaxies with lower stellar masses ( @xmath47 m@xmath2 ) and correspondingly lower bh masses ( @xmath63 m@xmath2 ) _ than the previous works of mrbgd which only probed to @xmath64 stellar masses .",
    "we also find that , remarkably , _ the galaxies in the low - mass regime ( @xmath65 m@xmath2 ) continue to follow the relationship originally measured and defined in the high - mass regime ( @xmath66 m@xmath2 ) @xcite_.     comparison between the black hole mass estimates computed from their ir luminosity and the black hole mass computed from the [ oiii ]  @xmath535007 line flux from the works of mrbgd for a subsample of 256 galaxies for which we were able to find a match ( _ black open triangles _ ) .",
    "previously optically identified type  1 and type  2 agn are shown as _ green triangles _ and _ blue triangles _",
    ", respectively . ]",
    "in figure  [ fig : mstar_bhmass ] , middle , we examine the stellar mass versus bh mass relationship of the bcds .",
    "we see that in the low - mass regime , the bcds tend to be located mostly above the relation .",
    "this may indicate that the upturn at low mass is not real but due to contamination from star formation activity .",
    "indeed , we find that the actively star forming bcds of @xcite ( _ magenta circles _ ) fall above the relation . also , the agn hosting bcd mrk  709  s @xcite ( _ red circle _ ) is expected to be affected by the host galaxy light based on its ir color ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "its position in the diagram does indeed show a value slightly above the relation .",
    "the errors on the stellar masses were determined using the uncertainties associated with the sed fit and were found to be of the order of 0.2  dex ( 97.5 percentile or 2@xmath15 error ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : mstar_bhmass ] , right , we explore the effect of the uncertainty introduced by using different methods on the scatter of the stellar mass versus bh mass relation .",
    "the different colors are associated with the different methods and catalogues used in estimating the stellar masses .",
    "we find that , except for the color measurement method , the agreement between the methods is quite good ( see also section  [ sec : mstar ] ) and does not change significantly the scatter seen in figure  [ fig : mstar_bhmass ] , left .",
    "the errors on the bh mass were calculated from the uncertainties in the bolometric luminosity measurements and were found to be @xmath140.2  dex . however , the main source of uncertainty in this measurement is the value of @xmath61 which we have assumed to be the same for all sources but that most likely varies for each source . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : mstar_bhmass ] , simply allowing this value to vary from 0.01 to 1.0 reproduces most of the scatter seen in the data .",
    "we compare in figure  [ fig : bhmassir_bhmassopt ] the black hole mass estimates computed from the ir luminosity and those computed from the [ oiii ]  @xmath535007 line flux from the works of mrbgd , for a subsample of 256 galaxies for which we were able to find a match .",
    "the bh mass cutoff of @xcite was @xmath68  ( 6.3 in log space , see their figure 1 ) and this cutoff is easily noticeable in the diagram .",
    "this comparison clearly shows that the bh mass estimates computed from the [ oiii ]  @xmath535007 line flux systematically underestimates the bh mass .",
    "given that the [ oiii ]  @xmath535007 line flux to bolometric correction is very uncertain ( @xmath69 ) , depends on extinction correction , and is much larger than the 12 micron to bolometric correction of @xmath70 , this is not surprising .",
    "this comparison highlights the fact that the ir method is a more robust method for estimating bh masses .",
    "we undertook a census of central massive black holes in the very nearby universe , targeting specifically low - mass dwarf systems with bh masses in the imbh mass range . using the wise all - sky release source catalog",
    ", we examined the ir colors of a sample of known nearby galaxies in order to identify both unobscured and obscured active galactic nuclei .",
    "we found that 313 nearby galaxies have wise colors consistent with galaxies containing an agn .",
    "of these , eleven lie within a distance of 11 mpc .",
    "we estimated the stellar and black hole masses for our nearby galaxy sample and found that activity is detected in stellar masses ranging @xmath47 m@xmath2 and that this activity is due to black holes with masses in the range @xmath3 m@xmath2 .",
    "the black hole masses probed here are several orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported for centrally located massive black holes .",
    "we examined the stellar mass versus black hole mass relationship in this low galaxy mass regime and found that the relation extends to these low masses .",
    "we compare our black hole mass estimates to estimates from the [ oiii ]  @xmath535007 line flux and find that the latter method systematically underestimates the black hole masses .",
    "these results indicate that central massive black holes are present in low - mass galaxies and in the local universe , and provide new impetus for follow up dynamical studies of quiescent black holes in local dwarf galaxies .",
