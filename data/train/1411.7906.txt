    "the power law ( linear response ) does not work well anymore .",
    "above the characteristic temperature @xmath6 * , @xmath13 displays the convex temperature dependence . but below @xmath6 * , the concave temperature dependence is observed .",
    "interestingly , we found that @xmath13 nearly follows @xmath35 dependence below @xmath6 * for kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 single crystal .",
    "in fact , for high quality kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 single crystal , @xmath50 follows a fermi liquid behavior ( @xmath35 dependence ) below @xmath6=60 k , while @xmath113 equals  780 @xcite .",

    "for bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 , charge dynamics is incoherent at @xmath6=300 k. the decomposition of the optical conductivity spectrum of kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 is nearly the same as that of bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "the highly incoherent spectrum seems to persist over the entire doping range in the normal state of ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 system .",
    "the results strongly suggest that quasiparticle states on a substantial part of fs remain incoherent at high temperatures in ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 system @xcite .",
    "taking the two - fluid model suggested for magnetic response of heavy electron materials @xcite , the local moment spins dominate above the peak temperature @xmath6 * , whereas the hybridization of local moment spins and conduction electron spins is significant and contributes more to magnetic susceptibility below @xmath6*. coherent component plays a significant role below @xmath6 * , where both resistivity and susceptibility drop @xcite ] .",
    "in fact , the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the thermal expansion provide experimental evidence for the existence of a coherence - incoherence crossover in kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the broad maximum at around 120 k indicates the onset of coherence . in the optimal doping region @xmath7",

    "resistivity of ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 superconductors shows a tendency for saturation above 100 k , which gives rise to a broad peak in the plots of @xmath115 vs @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this characteristic temperature is in coincidence with the peak temperature of susceptibility curves .",
    "hall coefficient , @xmath1 displays weak doping and temperature dependences above 150 k. but low temperature part within the doping range @xmath12 is quite distinct from that of the samples @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath1 tends to saturate below 150 k for the samples @xmath97 , whereas it shows rapid increase for the samples @xmath12 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the analysis of hall angle also supports the existence of characteristic temperature @xmath6 * , which is suggested to be related to the incoherence - coherence crossover .",
    "assuming two types of charge careers in ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 system @xcite , above @xmath6 * , highly incoherent charge carriers dominates , whereas coherent ones become significant below it . here the coherence process is related to the hybridization of conduction charge carriers and local spin moments , which gives rise to a large effective mass of conduction charge carriers . the overall behavior of magnetic susceptibility , hall coefficient , and resistivity provides evidences of incoherence - coherence crossover at @xmath6 * in ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 system .",
    "the coherent charge dynamics in bafe@xmath4(as@xmath2p@xmath3)@xmath4 and ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath4as@xmath4 systems is more pronounced than ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 system in the normal state @xcite",

    "in summary , we have performed magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 and hall coefficient @xmath1 measurements on a series of ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 single crystals . a crossover from sdw ordered sate to kfe@xmath4as@xmath4",
    "-type magnetic interactions occurs with increasing k content .",
    "it is found that @xmath0 monotonically increases with increasing temperature for the underdoped and optimally doped samples @xmath40 .",
    "for the overdoped samples @xmath9 , a big hump was observed at around 150 k , and it eventually evolves into a broad peak in kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 at 120 k. the magnitude of magnetic susceptibility keeps increasing with increasing k content .",
    "hall coefficient @xmath1 and hall angle @xmath109 display the dramatic change as @xmath8 exceeds 0.80 , which coincides with the critical doping point where electron pocket disappears with excess hole doping .",
    "our results strongly support that the change of doping dependence of hall coefficient @xmath1 and hall angle @xmath109 is related to the change of fs topology , i.e. the lifshitz transition .",
