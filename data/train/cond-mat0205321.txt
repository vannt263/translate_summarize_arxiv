    "it is often noted that nonequilibrium statistical mechanics lacks the comprehensive formalism of ensembles that has proved so useful in equilibrium .",
    "the reason is that equilibrium statistical mechanics treats stationary states for a special subclass of systems , that possess detailed balance .",
    "this allows one to bypass the dynamics , and study stationary properties directly . for systems out of equilibrium , we generally do not have such a shortcut , and must deal with the full dynamical problem , even if our goal is only to obtain stationary properties . in the case of stochastic systems with a discrete state space ,",
    "the fundamental description is given by the master equation , which governs the evolution of the probability distribution .",
    "this class of problems includes a wide range of systems of current interest , that exhibit phase transitions or scale invariance far from equilibrium : driven lattice gases , birth - and - death processes such as directed percolation or the contact process , sandpile models , and interface growth models .",
    "one of the more powerful tools for studying stochastic models is a formalism that maps the process to a path - integral representation @xcite .",
    "the mapping generates an _ effective action _ that can be studied using the tools of equilibrium statistical physics , for example , the renormalization group .",
    "several methods for mapping a stochastic process to an equilibrium - like action have been proposed @xcite . in these notes",
    "we review the method developed by peliti @xcite , and apply it to some simple stochastic processes .",
    "this method has several advantages . with it",
    ", one can map any birth - and - death type process to a path - integral representation without ambiguity .",
    "in particular , the step of writing a langevin equation , and of postulating noise autocorrelations , does not arise in this formalism .",
    "thus it provides a direct path from the model of interest to an effective action , and ( in the continuum limit ) , to its field theory , without the uncertainties that often attend the specification of the noise term @xcite .",
    "a second advantage , which we explore in some examples , is that it leads to a systematic perturbative analysis for markov processes .",
    "the principal aim of this article is to acquaint the reader with the formalism and provide a set of worked examples whose mastery will allow one to apply the method to problems at the frontier of research . while peliti s article @xcite provides an excellent exposition of the mapping , we include , for completeness , a derivation of the central formulas .",
    "our development of the perturbation theory differs somewhat from peliti s .",
    "most of the applications discussed are also new .",
    "the balance of this article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the path - integral representation , starting from the master equation . sec .",
    "iii presents an application to the simple decay process , and expressions for two - time joint probabilities . in sec .",
    "iv we begin our discussion of diagrammatic perturbation theory for the probability generating function , which is illustrated with a pedagogical example .",
