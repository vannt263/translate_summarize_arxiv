    "the keller and segel ( ks ) model @xcite is one of the most extensively studied chemotaxis models ; it describes , for instance , the aggregation of cellular slime molds driven by chemical attraction . because it gives rise to `` auto - aggregation ''",
    ", the ks model is used to describe many other phenomena including astrophysical ones @xcite .",
    "its mathematical properties , such as the existence of global solutions in time for certain choices of parameters and the finite time divergence for other choices , are understood to some extent @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is known that solutions of the one - dimensional case may diverge in a finite time only if the chemoattractant does not diffuse , but in higher dimensional spaces divergences are common @xcite .",
    "also , painter _",
    "et al _ have shown that the ks model allows pattern formation and spatiotemporal chaos in one spatial dimension @xcite , but these features have not been investigated in full detail in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional case .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we consider the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ks model with a logistic growth term , which in dimensionless form reads @xcite : @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the organism density and @xmath9 describes the concentration of the chemical signal around the point @xmath10 at time @xmath11 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath4 respectively stand for the organism diffusion or motility and the chemotactic sensitivity . the validity of eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) in the framework of chemotaxis is supported by some experiments on the _ escherichia coli ( e.coli ) _ bacterium ( see , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) even if this model does not seem to reproduce all the observed chemotactic motions @xcite .",
    "it is known that the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) with certain parameter choices reproduce an aggregation phenomenon which mimics chemotactic migration along the directions of gradients of self - produced chemicals .",
    "it remains to explore other regions of the parameters space in search of the parameter values which lead to globally existing solutions , the finite time divergence as well as the formation of regular patterns .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to know whether chaotic patterns arise in regions of bounded solutions .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate these questions by means of numerical simulations , and we show that the solutions of the ks equations in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions , with a logistic growth term , diverge in a finite time when the cellular growth rate @xmath1 exceeds a critical value @xmath2 .    a detailed discussion of different versions of the ks model and its applications to chemotaxis can be found in the literature , e.g. , in refs .",
    "chemotaxis is a biological process by which organisms alter their movements or orientations in response to chemical gradients and concerns , e.g. , the behaviors of _ e.coli_ , amoebae , endothelial and neutrophil cells .",
    "furthermore , it is of interest in phenomena such as cancer cell metastasis , embryogenesis , angiogenesis , tissue homeostasis , wound healing , immune response , progression of diseases , finding food , forming the multicellular body of protozoa etc . @xcite . in brief",
    ", chemotaxis is the process by which many organisms probe their environment and determine their movements in response to what they have found .",
    "equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) have a nontrivial steady - state solution @xmath12 .",
    "a linear stability analysis @xcite through which different parameter regimes can be found for the formation of spatiotemporal patterns shows that the corresponding modes are unstable for @xmath13 with wave numbers satisfying @xmath14 where @xmath15 thus , given a value of @xmath4 , the stable ( negative values ) and the unstable ( positive values ) regions can be represented in the @xmath16 plane as in fig . 1 .",

    ", width=384,height=288 ]    in an interval @xmath17 $ ] with homogeneous neumann ( zero - flux ) boundary conditions we have @xmath18 with @xmath19 , whilst for periodic boundary conditions we have @xmath20 .",
    "we numerically investigate eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) using zero - flux boundary conditions and with a time step @xmath21 , grid size @xmath22 in a simulation box of size @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "we explore the evolution of the density @xmath25 and of the chemical concentration @xmath26 in a larger domain , with an initial condition @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a spatially varying random perturbation .",
    "furthermore , we perform a wavelet analysis of spectra to show that chaotic patterns may form in some parameter region corresponding to bounded solutions .",
    "this is important for the excitation of many modes in the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we note that for zero - flux boundary conditions on an interval of length @xmath29 or @xmath30 , the smallest non - vanishing mode is the first , i.e.  @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "then , using the condition of instability , for both bounded and unbounded solutions , one may identify a parameter and a critical value below which patterns are regular , while they turn irregular if the parameter is higher than this critical value .",
    "if the solution is unbounded , it diverges in a finite time , as shown later .",
    "for example , fixing the parameter values @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we find that @xmath1 has a critical value @xmath35 , below which the wave pattern is regular or stable , and above which patterns exhibit irregular features .",
    "furthermore , depending on the parameter values considered , there exist a critical value for @xmath36 , which delimits the range of chaotic pattern formation .",
    "the latter also depends on the chemotactic nonlinearity for which the system exhibit finite solutions , as shown in the following subsection .    to obtain steady - state oscillations",
    ", we consider the case with @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath38 ) , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath39 and two different values of @xmath1 : @xmath40 ( upper panel of fig .",
    "2 ) and @xmath41 ( lower panel of fig .",
    "2 ) , which fall in the instability region ( _ c.f . _ fig .",
    "figure 2 shows that initially , the solution lies close to the steady - state value @xmath42 before the organism kinetics dominates .",
    "then , its density or the chemical concentration drops to a steady - state profile determined by the balance between the chemotactic nonlinear term and the dispersive diffusion term .",
    "we will later see that the bounded solution may no longer exist and finite - time divergence may develop if the value of @xmath1 is increased above @xmath43 .    ) and ( [ 2 ] ) at @xmath44 for two different values of @xmath1 : ( a ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 with a fixed @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the solutions first increase around the steady - state @xmath42 and then drop to a more or less constant value for a longer time.,width=384,height=288 ]      as the value of @xmath45 is lowered , i.e.  as @xmath46 increases in order that @xmath47 falls in the interval @xmath48 , the domain length increases and the regular patterns disappear while irregular spatiotemporal structures arise ( see fig .",
    "basically , the pattern selection leads to the excitation of many more modes involved in nonlinear interactions . as time advances , collision and fusion of patterns",
    "take place , giving rise to higher harmonic modes ( merging ) and to the emergence of new modes .",
    "we also note that increasing the domain size leads to higher concentrations of both @xmath25 and @xmath26 at a given time ( @xmath49 in fig .",
    "3 ) , and enhances the disorder of patterns till a chaotic evolution is established for @xmath50 , the condition required for solutions to be bounded .",
    "this is illustrated by the analysis of wavelet power spectra portrayed as in fig .",
    "4 .          as @xmath1 exceeds its critical value @xmath35 , the solutions quickly evolve and diverge in a finite time ( fig .",
    "5 ) , where the density and the chemical concentration are reported prior to the divergence time . figure 5 shows four different states at different times , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath51 .",
    "we find that the time of divergence depends on the values of @xmath1 : smaller @xmath1 implies longer time before the solution diverges .",
    "for instance , the divergence time in fig .",
    "5 is @xmath52 , whereas @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath53 imply a divergence at @xmath54 .",
    "further increase of the growth rate @xmath1 leads to collision and fusion of patterns in a short time when the nonlinear logistic growth term dominates over the diffusion and chemotactic terms .",
    "one can calculate the exact divergence times for other sets of parameters .",
    "it is to be noted that since the system is two - dimensional in space , the energy transferred in the nonlinear interactions may not be due to the spatiotemporal chaos as in the previous subsection , but could be primarily related to the wave collapse , i.e. , to the divergence of solutions .",
    "however , this aspect needs further investigation , which will be subject of future work .",
    "next , we explore the pattern dynamics for a set of combinations of the system parameters , especially by increasing the diffusion as well as the chemotactic coefficient .",
    "both parameters control various distinctive features . comparing the upper panel of fig .",
    "6 with fig .",
    "3(d ) , we note that increasing @xmath4 stabilizes oscillations by reducing the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . on the other hand , increasing the diffusion coefficient , while keeping the other parameters fixed as in fig .",
    "3(d ) , one can observe chaotic patterns similar to those of fig .",
    "3(d ) ( _ c.f .",
    "_ lower panel of fig .",
    "this can be explained as follows . as @xmath4 increases , with @xmath5 and @xmath1 fixed , the region of instability determined by the values of @xmath47 increases , since its lower limit @xmath55 decreases while its upper limit @xmath56 increases .",
    "in other words , @xmath46 may be smaller or fewer modes may be involved in the nonlinear dynamics leading to chaos . on the other hand , when @xmath5 increases with other parameters fixed , the instability region",
    "is strongly reduced , since the opposite happens with the lower limit and upper limits for @xmath47 , and @xmath46 has to be larger in order for @xmath47 to fall within the instability region @xmath14 .",
    "thus , many more modes will participate in the collision and fusion process , and as a result spatiotemporal chaotic patterns may likely arise .",
    "figure 7 represents the contour plot of the wavelet power spectra , corresponding to fig . 6 , plotted against a normalized sampling time @xmath57 ( lower panel ) .",
    "this shows that the system is chaotic for a long time interval .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the dynamics become more complex in nature at large values of @xmath11 [ _ c.f . _",
    "we have explored the nonlinear dynamics of a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional chemotaxis model of ks - type . specifically , by numerical simulations , we have focused on the existence of bounded solutions , solutions which diverge in finite - time as well as on the formation of different patterns including those arising from merging .    in the parameter range , where the solutions remain permanently bounded ,",
    "the existence of spatiotemporal chaotic states is demonstrated by the analysis of wavelet power spectra .",
    "these phenomena are important in the context of chemotactic migration but so far , to the best of our knowledge , have not been explored in two - dimensional ks models .",
    "we have shown that an increase of the chemotactic coefficient @xmath58 and/ or keeping the growth rate @xmath59 , stable solutions around the steady - state are generated after a long time @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , taking the growth rate beyond its critical value leads to the finite time divergence of the solutions for the density and the chemical concentration . concerning pattern formation and evolution in a large domain , suitable combinations of the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 ,",
    "e.g.  @xmath61 and @xmath62 , lead to bounded solutions which develop spatiotemporal chaos , whose complexity grows in time .",
