    "the human electroencephalogram ( eeg ) , as measured at the scalp , represents a superposition of electric fields resulting from post - synaptic potentials in neocortex , the thin ( 2 to 5 mm ) surface layer of human brains .",
    "several models of neocortical dynamics treat eeg as a mixed global / local phenomenon @xcite , and a better understanding of its spatial - temporal dynamics is necessary for evaluation and refinement of these models .",
    "its temporal behavior has been studied at length , both by clinical observation @xcite and with such tools as power spectra @xcite , coherence @xcite , the hilbert transform @xcite , and many others . however , until recently poor spatial resolution ( due to minimal electrode sampling and under - use of head models ) has limited spatial analysis of eeg @xcite .    as a potential field on a near - hemispherical surface ,",
    "eeg is amenable to analysis by spherical harmonic decomposition . in this paper , we apply two methods of decomposition ( one described by cadusch @xcite and one adapted from misner @xcite ) to 131-channel eeg data . using simulated data , we discuss issues and pitfalls relevant to such an analysis , specifically the effects of limited and irregular sampling density , integration over a hemisphere , and deviations from a spherical surface . from the experimental data ,",
    "we then draw conclusions regarding the frequency - wavenumber relation of neocortical activity .",
    "we use the real spherical harmonics @xcite , defined on the sphere @xmath0 and described by the orthogonality integral @xmath1 in theory , a potential field @xmath2 may be decomposed into spherical harmonic amplitudes @xmath3 defined by @xmath4 in the example of eeg and similar data we encounter three major and two minor issues .      first , when attempting to decompose experimental data , we sample @xmath2 at specific locations @xmath5 . assuming near - regularly spaced electrodes , our maximum resolvable @xmath6 is determined by a spherical analog of the familiar nyquist limit @xcite @xmath7 . with mean angular inter - electrode distance @xmath8",
    ", we initially adopt a conservative limit of @xmath9\\label{eq3},\\ ] ] or @xmath10 for our 131-channel electrode cap .",
    "analog pre - filtering to avoid spatial aliasing is not required here due to the low - pass characteristics of the head volume conductor @xcite .      with sampled data @xmath11 , the discretized version of the decomposition in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] is unstable in higher @xmath6-indices .",
    "( an apparently accurate reconstruction of the signal may be generated , with large artifacts in the higher spatial frequencies . )",
    "we must invoke constraint or regularization techniques to address this issue .",
    "et al _ @xcite approached the problem as a side issue of spherical spline interpolation .",
    "the estimate @xmath12 is constrained by the spline constraints , and the problem for a given sampling grid and @xmath13 is reduced to a multiplication by a matrix of @xmath14 coefficients : @xmath15    recently , misner @xcite introduced a more complex method for decomposition on a rectangular three - dimensional grid ; that is , generalized to use @xmath16 .",
    "we implement here the special case of sampling on a spherical surface , more relevant to eeg analysis , in which @xmath17 is constant . in misner",
    "s method , a correction matrix of @xmath18 accounts for discretization and limited sampling : @xmath19 where a and b refer to index groups @xmath20 .",
    "here we use the real harmonics and replace misner s weight function @xmath21 with the effective area of each electrode .",
    "@xmath22 , the matrix inverse of the @xmath18 , is used to calculate `` adjoint spherical harmonics '' @xmath23 .",
    "finally , a set of coefficients @xmath24 , analogous to cadusch @xmath25 , is generated and used as in eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] to estimate @xmath26 .      particularly relevant to eeg analysis is the error introduced by sampling over only half of the sphere .",
    "this sampling corresponds to only @xmath27 of a spatial cycle of the @xmath28 , @xmath29 function , suggesting potential accuracy problems for functions involving @xmath30 .",
    "it is also clear that the functions @xmath31 will no longer be orthonormal for @xmath32 only ; rather , we replace the @xmath33 in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] with an error quantity @xmath34 : @xmath35 in general , our hemispherical estimates @xmath36 will be related to the hypothetical full - sphere result by the matrix of @xmath37 s : @xmath38 and our @xmath39 become somewhat ambiguous between certain sets of @xmath40 . although it may seem appropriate to invert @xmath41 and calculate a more accurate result , the matrix is ill - conditioned ( @xmath42 , where the 2-norm condition number @xmath43 is the ratio of the largest singular value of @xmath41 to the smallest ) and thus the inversion is problematic .",
    "in addition , if we use the hemispherical region to calculate misner s @xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] , the resulting matrix of @xmath18 is ill - conditioned ( @xmath42 ) and thus the @xmath22 can not be reliably found .",
    "rather , we created a mirrored set of electrodes @xmath44 , calculated the matrix * r * of @xmath24 for sample set @xmath45 , and discarded the antipodal rows of * r*. cadusch spline method , while still subject to eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] , is native to the hemispherical surface and requires no further manipulation .      in many problems ,",
    "the sphere has no preferred direction .",
    "the @xmath46-indices are usually collapsed @xcite to produce an angular power spectrum estimate @xmath47 as a function of wavenumber @xmath6 : @xmath48 which is independent of coordinate system orientation .",
    "as well , we found the `` hemispherical error '' in @xmath6-spectrum to be independent of orientation . in some eeg studies , of course , the orientation of the underlying cerebral hemispheres may be relevant .",
    "in such cases , local spatial fourier analysis @xcite should adequately complement our decomposition without the complication of distinguishing @xmath46-modes .",
    "we assume that our medium @xmath0 is a sphere , whereas biological data is often sampled on an irregular surface .",
    "the upper surface of the `` average '' human head @xcite may be represented as a hemiellipsoid with axes @xmath49 cm , @xmath50 cm , and @xmath51 cm , or alternatively 25% , -9% , and 0% elongation from a perfect sphere .",
    "although prolate spheroidal harmonics have been applied to biophysical field problems @xcite , the technique is often unwieldy . in comparison to error from @xmath37 , especially for low @xmath6",
    ", we assume the error due to approximating the ellipsoidal surface with a spherical surface is negligible .",
    "we generated evenly tessellated , hemispherical electrode maps of 74 , 187 , 282 , and 559 electrodes , in addition to common experimental maps of 20 , 64 , and 131 @xcite electrodes .",
    "five hundred potential maps were simulated for each electrode configuration .",
    "each potential map was randomly generated with harmonics of degree @xmath52 , such that the @xmath3 varied with uniform distribution between 0 and 1 .",
    "power spectrum estimates @xmath47 were then calculated for each map , using both methods .",
    "figure  [ corrunif ] shows pearson s correlation coefficients @xmath53 , calculated between @xmath54 and @xmath47 over the 500 trials for each electrode map .",
    "we have noted that the error due to @xmath37 causes power from one @xmath40-component to be misinterpreted as power in another , often of different @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we might expect either method s performance to depend on the @xmath6-spectrum being analyzed . using preliminary experimental data , we constructed an approximate power spectrum @xmath55 for average - referenced scalp eeg , peaked at @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and decaying with @xmath58 thereafter .",
    "another five hundred potential maps were generated , with @xmath3 uniformly distributed between @xmath59 to simulate a physiologically realistic distribution of @xmath6-spectra .",
    "power spectrum estimates @xmath47 were calculated for each map using both methods .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ corrreal ] .    in general , results for the spline method",
    " though often quite accurate  were dependent on the distribution of @xmath6-spectra being measured , exact electrode positions , and electrode numbers .",
    "results for the adjoint harmonic method seemed more robust , even for sparse ( @xmath60 ) sampling , although accuracy was somewhat less in the higher harmonics .    in both methods , for @xmath52 we observed minimal improvement for more than 131 electrodes .",
    "we thus believe that our 131-channel sampling is an appropriate tool for further study .",
    "furthermore , given the limit in eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] and the known volume - conductor attenuation of higher modes @xcite , we suggest that study of spatial frequencies higher than approximately @xmath61 will be better served by intracranial eeg than by denser electrode maps .",
    "in general , for low @xmath6 the adjoint harmonic method seemed more consistent .",
    "we examined typical 131-channel decompositions ( fig .",
    "[ threemeths ] ) to investigate further .",
    "both methods accurately reproduced the potential maps ( @xmath62 for 131 channels ) .",
    "the spline method , however , was slightly unstable for low @xmath6 , and the erroneous negative @xmath26 are reflected in the power spectrum .",
    "any application of the spherical harmonic decomposition should take into account the estimated relative contribution of various error sources . aside from measurement and experimental error ,",
    "these may be divided into three categories : sampling error , orientation error , and hemispherical error .",
    "figures  [ corrunif ] and  [ corrreal ] indicate minimal improvement for @xmath63 with more than 131 electrodes .",
    "we can thus deduce that the nyquist - like limit in eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] is an appropriate guideline . when using coarser sampling , we expect some decrease in performance for higher @xmath6 . decreased accuracy for 20 , 64 , and 74 channels ( seen in figs .",
    "[ corrunif ] and  [ corrreal ] , particularly for 20 channels ) may be attributed to sampling error .      for a given @xmath6-spectrum",
    ", results will vary if power is randomly distributed across the @xmath46 s ; that is , various @xmath46-components interact differently with our hemispherical sample grid .",
    "five hundred random @xmath6-spectra , with realistic distribution of @xmath64 , were generated .",
    "thirty 131-channel maps , randomly varying in @xmath46-power , were generated for each original @xmath6-spectrum .",
    "figure  [ corrmult ] displays the resulting accuracy , again shown as correlation coefficient @xmath53 between @xmath64 and @xmath47 over the 100 trials .    very little",
    "is gained in this simulation by decomposition of multiple epochs . as described in the following section , error due to @xmath46-distribution of power",
    "is largely swamped by hemispherical error . in practice , however , we must emphasize ( in the presence of random measurement noise ) the importance of averaging decompositions across many epochs .",
    "orientation error will also become significant if our sampling grid is severely non - uniform .      in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] above , we have discussed the hemispherical error @xmath37 . although it is impossible to improve our decomposition results by inverting the matrix @xmath41 , we may generate a corresponding matrix for the power spectrum result and use it to estimate the contribution of hemispherical error .",
    "power in a single harmonic @xmath65 is blurred by the hemispherical decomposition into surrounding harmonics . using the 131-channel sampling map , we generated five hundred potential maps for each of @xmath66 , each with one unit power distributed randomly among the available @xmath46 s . by averaging over the five hundred resulting power spectra ,",
    "for each @xmath6 , we obtained an empirical `` averaged blurring matrix '' @xmath67 for power spectra obtained from hemispherical decomposition .",
    "that is , @xmath68 the typical @xmath67 for both methods is a blurred identity matrix ; that is , error in power spectra is largely between adjacent @xmath6 .",
    "it is again tempting to invert @xmath67 , de - blur our spectra , and calculate a more accurate result , but although most @xmath67 are invertable we found that for realistic spectra the benefit was marginal at best .",
    "instead , @xmath67 may be used to better understand the implications of hemispherical error .",
    "we calculated correlation coefficients as in fig .",
    "[ corrmult ] , between @xmath69 over the 500 trials of 30 epochs for 131 electrodes .",
    "the resulting higher correlations ( although not applicable to a decomposition of real data ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ corrsph ] . by comparison with figs .",
    "[ corrreal]a and  [ corrmult ] , the result indicates the importance of hemispherical error .",
    "in particular , after examination of typical @xmath67 and @xmath41 matrices , we may interpret the decreased performance at low @xmath6 as blurring between adjacent wavenumbers .",
    "furthermore , the increased effect , seen in fig .  [ corrsph ] , of averaging across various @xmath46-distributions indicates that some abrupt changes in performance may be attributed to sensitive interactions between @xmath67-blurring and random @xmath46-distribution .",
    "practically , the near - identity character of @xmath67 is extremely useful .",
    "hemispherical error manifests as blurring between adjacent @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we may expect composite measures such as the sum of power in @xmath6=0,1 to be substantially more accurate than individual estimates .",
    "figure  [ corrcomposite ] displays the accuracy of @xmath6=0,1 and @xmath6=2  6 adjoint harmonic power estimates ( used below in our experimental trials ) , for 500 epochs , realistic @xmath6-distribution , and various sampling densities .",
    "nunez in 1974 @xcite and shaw in 1991 @xcite , using fourier analysis along linear electrode eeg arrays , observed a relationship between increasing spatial and increasing temporal frequency in the 8 - 13 hz band , roughly consistent with simple wave dispersion relations .",
    "we attempted to duplicate this result in order to test the adjoint harmonic method under experimental conditions .",
    "we analyzed 131-channel eeg ( resting , eyes closed ) in five human subjects .",
    "temporal fourier coefficients were determined for 300 to 600 one - second epochs ( depending on available data ) , and @xmath6-spectra averaged over these epochs .",
    "results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] as the ratio of power in low ( @xmath70 ) to power in high ( @xmath71 ) spatial frequencies . above approximately @xmath72 , with increasing @xmath73 we observed a general trend towards power in higher @xmath6 .",
    "we also observed high - wavenumber power in the delta band ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the alpha band ( c. 813 hz ) was characterized by the highest power in low spatial frequencies .    in order to rule out methodological artifact",
    ", we generated and analyzed 300 seconds of simulated eeg using 3602 uncorrelated sources , each generating 1/f noise through a head volume conductor model as described in @xcite .",
    "as expected , the eeg - like noise ( labeled rnd in the figure ) showed no relation between spatial and temporal frequencies .",
    "estimates of the temporal power spectrum are known to vary in chi - square distribution @xcite , assuming normally distributed estimates of the underlying fourier coefficients .",
    "error distribution for spatial spectrum estimates , on the other hand , is complicated by the dependence of hemispherical and orientation error on the entire @xmath6-spectrum . for composite measures of both spatial and temporal spectra , such as shown in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] , the situation becomes even more problematic .",
    "we propose an empirical test for estimation of such confidence levels , analogous to the randomization tests commonly applied in nonparametric statistical analysis @xcite .",
    "let @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total power in harmonics @xmath6=0 and @xmath6=1 , and @xmath77 is the total power in harmonics @xmath6=2 through @xmath6=6 .",
    "let @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 represent estimates of the same .",
    "above , we calculated @xmath81 for various temporal frequencies . here , we calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval for single - epoch estimates of the actual @xmath82 .",
    "the confidence interval will apply only to the spatial spectrum composite measure , neglecting error ( or nonstationarity ) in temporal frequency spectra , which for many applications may be as important .",
    "note , though , that for 300 epochs the normalized standard error of a temporal power spectrum estimate is less than 6% .    to determine an empirical confidence interval",
    ", we would typically examine the distribution of random re - samples .",
    "in this application , we created many random @xmath6-spectra from an estimated distribution of @xmath6-power , simulated many decompositions , and examined the resulting distribution as follows .",
    "since hemispherical error is dependent on @xmath6-spectrum , the result will be influenced by the distribution of the random spectra .",
    "et al _ @xcite analytically estimated the spatial frequency domain transfer function for volume - conduction blurring of scalp potential as proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "this `` spatial smearing '' is due mainly to the poorly conducting skull and physical separation between cortical current sources and scalp electrodes . in our calculation , we assumed that underlying @xmath6-spectra vary in uniform distribution in proportion to @xmath84 , and that with average - referenced data the contribution of @xmath6=0 is negligible . a large number ( 20,000 ) of @xmath6-spectra",
    "were generated , randomly selecting for each @xmath6-bin a value from the appropriate distribution .",
    "the decomposition was performed , and the composite measure @xmath85 calculated , for each randomized spectrum .    by examining the distribution of known surrogate @xmath86 which produce a certain estimate @xmath87",
    ", we can estimate an empirical confidence interval for our spectral estimate . in fig .",
    "[ confidence ] , we show the scatter plot of @xmath86 against @xmath87 with 95% confidence intervals . for a given estimate @xmath80 and",
    "the assumptions discussed above , 95% of the time , the actual @xmath85 will fall between the two lines shown .",
    "a similar procedure may be used to calculate confidence intervals for other measures , whether the actual @xmath88 or other composite measures .",
    "careful judgment must be applied when estimating confidence intervals for multiple - epoch measures such as shown in fig .",
    "[ corrcomposite ] .",
    "as demonstrated earlier in this paper , variation in the @xmath46-component of an @xmath89-spectrum only allows us to `` average out '' the minimal orientation error .",
    "variation in hemispherical error ( dependent on @xmath6-spectrum ) , without gross violation of the stationarity assumption , is necessary for the average of estimates @xmath80 over multiple epochs to converge to @xmath85 .",
    "our simulations provide a firm basis for application of spherical harmonic decomposition to irregularly sampled , hemispherical data such as eeg .",
    "our hemispherical modification of misner s adjoint harmonic method @xcite proved most consistent .",
    "however , for physiological data of known power distribution , the spline method @xcite is complementary and may be slightly more accurate with high - density sampling .",
    "it seems that , within the conservative band - limit of equation @xcite and the known spatial filter properties of the head @xcite , decomposition accuracy will not be materially improved by more than 131 electrodes for scalp eeg .",
    "we suggest that confidence intervals for such decompositions , or for decomposition - derived measures , be determined empirically using randomized data . furthermore , while single - decomposition errors are relatively large , with multiple epochs the experimental accuracy may be increased substantially . for this averaging to be both valid and effective , we must assume a quasi - stationary wavenumber spectrum across our epochs , but with sufficient random variation in hemispherical error for our estimates to converge upon the mean .",
    "in addition , especially in eeg applications , we must remain aware of the limitations inherent in collapse across @xmath46 s ( we assume the orientation of the underlying cerebral hemispheres is irrelevant ) and the use of spherical harmonics on a hemispheroidal surface .",
    "the dynamical properties of human eeg rhythms are quite complicated , varying substantially between individuals and brain states .",
    "furthermore , physiologically - based theoretical models point to substantial nonlinear effects and interactions across spatial scales @xcite . despite all the obvious complications , results from the spherical harmonic decomposition of experimental eeg agreed qualitatively with crude linear electrode array results @xcite .",
    "these results were seen in all subjects and are consistent with a mixed global / local model of cortical dynamics , in which lower global mode oscillations produce alpha rhythm , superimposed on local ( spatially uncorrelated ) activity in various frequency bands @xcite .",
    "further study of spatiotemporal eeg dynamics , using spherical harmonic decomposition , should shed more light on these issues .      also at department of biomedical engineering , tulane university ; e - mail wingeier@bsi.swin.edu.au .",
