    "precision tests of the electroweak interactions at lep have provided the most sensitive checks of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the pattern that has emerged is that of consistent agreement with the standard model predictions .",
    "this pattern seems to have so far only one apparently dissonant note , namely in the measurement of the ratio @xmath10 , where the latest global fit to the lep data ( @xmath4 @xcite ) lies more than two standard deviations above the one - loop standard model prediction @xcite for all preferred values of the top - quark mass ( , @xmath11 for @xmath3 ) .",
    "further experimental statistics will reveal whether this is indeed a breakdown of the standard model . in the meantime",
    ", it is important to explore what new contributions to @xmath5 are expected in models of new physics , such as supersymmetry .",
    "the study of supersymmetric contributions to @xmath12 has proceeded in two phases .",
    "originally the quantity @xmath13 @xcite was defined as an extension of the @xmath14 scheme @xcite for model - independent fits to the electroweak data .",
    "more recently it has become apparent that the ratio @xmath5 is more directly calculable @xcite and readily measurable .",
    "it has been made apparent @xcite that supersymmetric contributions to @xmath5 are not likely to increase the total predicted value for @xmath5 in any significant manner , as long as typical assumptions about unified supergravity models are made . on the other hand , if these assumptions are relaxed , it is possible for supersymmetry to make a significant contribution to @xmath5 , if certain conditions on the low - energy supersymmetric spectrum are satisfied  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reexamine this question in the context of a variety of supergravity models , which include the constrained minimal supergravity model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as non - minimal string - inspired supergravity models . in all cases",
    "we find @xmath1 , which brings the standard model prediction at most one - fifth of a standard deviation closer to the experimental result .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 could well be negative , worsening the standard model fit , although only slightly .",
    "we then turn to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , where the many parameters are _ a priori _ independent , and seek to delineate the region of parameter space which yields large values of @xmath5 .",
    "this exercise confirms the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , that light charginos and top - squarks of definite composition are required . however , we take the further step of trying to quantify how large a region of parameter space this is . in other words ,",
    "what kind of fine - tuning is involved in attaining such large values of @xmath5 . to this end",
    "we apply all known experimental constraints which may affect the preferred region of parameter space : ( i ) that @xmath6 be within the allowed cleo range , ( ii ) that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) be neutral and colorless , ( iii ) that the invisible top - quark branching ratio ( , @xmath16 ) be within experimental limits , ( iv ) that the invisible @xmath17 width be within lep limits , and ( v ) that @xmath18 be within lep limits . by sampling a large number of random values for the six - plet of parameters that determine @xmath15 and the other five experimental observables , we conclude that , of all points in parameter space that yield @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , only a few percent satisfy the _ combined _ additional experimental constraints .",
    "we should remark that the region of mssm parameter space where @xmath15 is enhanced , has recently become the focus of attention for another reason .",
    "it has been argued that the apparent disagreement between the lep determination of @xmath21 and the corresponding value obtained from low - energy measurements , may hint to the possibility of new physics @xcite .",
    "moreover , light supersymmetric particles seem to fit the bill by shifting downwards the lep - extracted value of @xmath21 @xcite , if observables like @xmath5 can be brought to better agreement with experiment .",
    "our restrictions on parameter space apply also to this case , to the extent that sufficiently large values of @xmath5 are called for .",
    "besides the one - loop standard model contributions to @xmath5 , in supersymmetric models there are four new diagrams , as follows :    * the charged - higgs  top - quark loop , depends on the charged higgs mass and the @xmath22 coupling . for a left - handed @xmath23 quark",
    "the coupling is @xmath24 whereas for a right - handed @xmath23 quark it is @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , for small . ]",
    "( large ) @xmath26 left- ( right)-handed @xmath23-quark production is dominant .",
    "( for @xmath27 , the value of @xmath28 impacts the contribution significantly . )",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath29 contribution is always negative @xcite , a fact which makes the prediction for @xmath5 in two higgs - doublet models always in worse agreement with experiment . *",
    "the chargino  top - squark loop , is the supersymmetric counterpart of the @xmath30@xmath31 loop discussed above .",
    "the chargino mass eigenstate is a mixture of ( charged ) higgsino and wino , and the coupling strength is a complicated matter now because it involves the top - squark mixing matrix and the chargino mixing matrix .",
    "however , because only the higgsino admixture in the chargino eigenstate has a yukawa coupling to the @xmath31@xmath23 doublet , generally speaking a light chargino with a significant higgsino component , and a light top - squark with a significant right - handed component are required for this diagram to make a non - negligible contribution to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "* the neutralino  bottom - squark loop , is the supersymmetric counterpart of the neutral - higgs  bottom - quark loop .",
    "the coupling strength of @xmath32 is also rather complicated , since it involves the bottom - squark mixing , the neutralino mixing , and their masses .",
    "however , it can be non - negligible since it is proportional to @xmath33 for the left - handed @xmath23-quark . therefore in the high-@xmath26 region",
    "we have to include this contribution .",
    "@xcite , although it was pointed out that its effects were non - negligible for @xmath27 .",
    "* the neutral - higgs  bottom - quark loop , involves the three neutral scalars , two cp - even ( @xmath34 ) and one cp - odd ( @xmath35 ) . for the @xmath36 neutral higgs boson",
    "the coupling to the bottom quark is @xmath37 which in the absence of a @xmath26 enhancement makes its contribution negligible . for the @xmath35 higgs boson ,",
    "the coupling to @xmath38 is @xmath39 and the @xmath35-dependent contribution can be large and positive if @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "since we restrict ourselves to @xmath42 , and @xmath43 in supergravity models , this contribution is neglected in what follows .",
    "our computations of @xmath44 have been performed using the expressions given in ref .",
    "@xcite . even though these formulas are given explicitly , the details are quite complicated by the presence of various passarino - veltman loop functions . as a check of our computations ,",
    "we have verified numerically that the results are independent of the unphysical renormalization scale that appears in the formulas .",
    "we consider unified supergravity models with universal soft supersymmetry breaking at the unification scale , and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( enforced using the one - loop effective potential ) at the weak scale @xcite .",
    "these constraints reduce the number of parameters needed to describe the models to four , which can be taken to be @xmath45 , with a specified value for the top - quark mass , which we take to be @xmath3 . among these four - parameter supersymmetric models ,",
    "we consider generic models with continuous values of @xmath46 and discrete choices for the other three parameters : @xmath47 the choices of @xmath26 are representative ; higher values of @xmath26 are likely to yield values of @xmath6 in conflict with present experimental limits @xcite .",
    "the choices of @xmath48 correspond to @xmath49 .",
    "the choice of @xmath35 has little impact on the results .",
    "we also consider the case of no - scale @xmath50 supergravity @xcite . in this class of models the supersymmetry breaking parameters are related in a string - inspired way . in the two - parameter _ moduli _ scenario @xmath51 @xcite , whereas in the _ dilaton _ scenario @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "a series of experimental constraints and predictions for these models have been given in ref .",
    "in particular , the issue of precision electroweak tests in this class of models has been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    the predictions for @xmath15 in the generic supergravity models",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ rb_ssm ] .",
    "only curves for @xmath53 are shown , since the corresponding sets of curves for other values of @xmath26 fall between these two sets of curves .",
    "the results in @xmath50 supergravity , for the same values of the parameters , differ little from those in the generic models . to add generality to our result and to compare with the study made below in the case of the mssm",
    ", we have also considered the case where the four supergravity parameters are chosen at random .",
    "we have sampled 10,000 random four - plets of parameter values , in the ranges : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "as expected , we find @xmath1 .",
    "a histogram of the relative distribution of @xmath15 values is shown in fig .",
    "[ hist.ssm ] , which shows that @xmath15 is equally likely to be positive or negative , and that the  preferred value \" is very small .    in almost all cases",
    "the largest positive contribution to @xmath44 comes from the chargino  top - squark loop .",
    "as expected , the largest contribution from this diagram happens for points with the lightest chargino masses ( which correspond to the lightest @xmath58 masses ) since supersymmetry is a decoupling theory . however , even the largest value @xmath59 is still very small compared with the largest possible result in a generic low - energy supersymmetric model .",
    "the reason for this is that while the smallest possible chargino and a top - squark masses are required for an enhanced contribution , it is also necessary that the top - squark be mostly right - handed and that the chargino has a significant higgsino component  @xcite . a scatter plot of the values of these couplings is shown in fig .  [ tvsv.ssm ] , where the right - handed component of the lightest top - squark ( @xmath60 ) is plotted against the higgsino component of the lightest chargino ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the first requirement is in fact attainable in these models ( , @xmath62 ) , but the former is not ( , @xmath63 ) .",
    "this behavior is expected in supergravity models with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking since for light charginos @xmath64 , which makes the lightest chargino mainly a wino instead of a higgsino .",
    "( this is also the reason why the results in @xmath65 supergravity differ little from those in the generic models . ) concerning the other contributions to @xmath15 , the charged - higgs  top - quark loop is always negative , and is enhanced for either small or large values of @xmath26 .",
    "the neutralino  bottom - squark contribution is almost always smaller than the chargino  top - squark contribution and not of definite sign .",
    "thus , @xmath5 in supergravity models could improve the standard model fit to the lep data by at most one - fifth of a standard deviation , and it could well worsen the fit by the same small amount .",
    "we now relax the supergravity assumptions that correlate the various supersymmetric parameters , in order to explore the region of the mssm parameter space that yields large values of @xmath5 .",
    "this region is then subjected to all available experimental constraints , which have the effect of restricting it significantly .",
    "the @xmath15 observable depends on six basic parameters : the elements of the chargino mass matrix ( @xmath66 ) which determine the chargino masses and their composition , and the two top - squark ( @xmath67 ) masses and their mixing angle ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "in addition , the higgs boson masses enter , although for @xmath69 the neutral higgs boson contribution is not relevant @xcite .",
    "the charged higgs mass is relevant for small values of @xmath26 , but this contribution to @xmath5 is always negative and will be neglected in what follows ( , we take a large charged higgs mass ) . neglecting altogether the higgs - boson contribution to @xmath15",
    "is generally justified when looking for the largest values of @xmath5 , although some exceptions exist for rather low values of the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass ( @xmath70 ) and large values of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we have sampled a large number of random choices for the six - plet of parameters , in the ranges @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "we have concentrated on the small-@xmath26 region since for large values of @xmath26 , where @xmath15 may also be enhanced , @xmath6 is likely to exceed significantly the allowed cleo range @xcite .",
    "a histogram depicting the relative distribution of calculated values of @xmath74 is shown in fig .",
    "[ hist.mssm ] .",
    "[ note that small negative values of @xmath15 are possible ( although not very likely ) .",
    "] as expected , there is a steady decline in the likelihood of the larger values of @xmath15 , with the following relative distributions @xmath75 where for example , only @xmath76 of the sampled six - plets yield @xmath77 , which brings the total @xmath5 prediction inside the 90%cl allowed range for @xmath3 .",
    "also , to be within the @xmath20 range , and thus to significantly improve the fit to the lep data , requires considerable fine tuning . if the sampling region were to be extended ( , a larger mass interval or larger values of @xmath26 )",
    "we would find that the new points fall into the lowest bins in fig .",
    "[ hist.mssm ] , while the population of the bins with large @xmath5 values would correspondingly decrease .",
    "the distributions in eq .",
    "( [ distributions ] ) would change accordingly .    in fig .",
    "[ rbmax ] we show the maximum attainable value of @xmath15 as a function of the chargino mass , which makes apparent the need for a light chargino if @xmath15 is to be enhanced .",
    "in fact , the maximum value is obtained for @xmath78 ( and also @xmath79 ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed before in the context of the @xmath13 approach to the problem @xcite , and corresponds to a wavefunction renormalization effect when the particles in the loop go on shell .    for concreteness , in what follows we concentrate on the @xmath80 of the points that increase @xmath5 by at least @xmath20 ; the other cases in eq .",
    "( [ distributions ] ) depend on the choice of @xmath81 . by design",
    ", this sample contains 1000 points for each sign of @xmath82 .",
    "first let us show that the region of parameter space which leads to enhanced values of @xmath15 is indeed characterized by light higgsino - like charginos and light right - handed  like top - squarks . in fig .",
    "[ stop - ch ] we show the distribution of points in the @xmath83 plane that lead to @xmath19 , and in fig .",
    "[ tvsv.mssm ] we show the corresponding distribution in @xmath84 space .",
    "if @xmath19 is indeed required , then lepii should see the lightest chargino and possibly also the ligthest top - squark .",
    "the observed marked preference for large values of the @xmath85 admixtures becomes evident when one considers the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath86 which picks out @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "this interaction also leads to an enhanced coupling between the top - quark , a higgsino - like neutralino , and a right - handed top - squark , and may lead to enhanced exotic decays of the top - quark , as we discuss below . comparing fig .",

    "such strong restrictions would also allow detection of the lightest higgs boson at lepii , and both top - squarks at the tevatron and lepii .",

    "@xmath15 could improve the standard model fit to the lep data by only a small fraction of a standard deviation , and it could well worsen the fit by the same small amount . in the mssm , light higgsino - like charginos and light right - handed - like top - squarks",
    "are required to obtain a sizeable @xmath15 value .",
    "such values occur in a small fraction of the parameter space , which is largely accessible to lepii searches .",
    "this region of parameter space is further constrained by five experimental observables , most importantly @xmath6 and the invisible top - quark branching fraction .",
    "imposing these additional constraints reduces the allowed parameter space to a few percent of its unconstrained size , and makes experimental exploration of this scenario in both chargino and top - squarks assured at lepii .",
