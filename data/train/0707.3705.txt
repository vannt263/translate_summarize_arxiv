    "methods like hartree fock ( hf )  @xcite and the density functional theory  @xcite have been used . generally , these seem to provide less accurate estimates for the ground states which also can have unphysical broken symmetries due to incomplete ansatz wave functions .",

    "a first estimate for the ground state energy and the wavefunction is obtained .",
    "then , _ both the total spin and the angular momentum _ of the uhf variational wave function are introduced by projecting on the corresponding subspaces .",
    "we show that , after restoring _ all of the symmetries _ , the energies and the wave functions are improved and show physical features which are not included in the uhf method .",

    "we determine the ground state energies as a function of a magnetic field , and obtain the chemical potential that can be measured in transport experiments .",
    "our main findings are :    ( _ i _ ) by projecting the uhf wave functions on the total angular momentum @xmath8 and on the total spin @xmath9 , the ground state energy is successively lowered .",
    "the correction due to the spin projection is generally smaller than the one associated with the angular momentum , but still necessary for determining the correct ground state and its quantum numbers .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the quantum numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 are correctly reproduced , if the strength of the interaction is not too large .",
    "especially , for @xmath10 , the first hund s rule  namely that @xmath9 is maximized for open shells  is recovered for @xmath0 electrons , except for @xmath11 , discussed below .",
    "hund s rule has been claimed earlier to be violated on the basis of uhf results  @xcite .",
    "( _ iii _ ) by comparing the results with ci and qmc , we estimate a correlation energy , defined as the difference between phf and `` exact '' energies , of about 2% of the ground state energy .",
    "( _ iv _ ) with increasing interaction strength the correlation energy decreases .",
    "nevertheless , for stronger interaction , and larger @xmath1 , the phf ground state tends to be spin polarized in contrast to more exact results .",
