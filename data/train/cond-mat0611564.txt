    "transport in many random structures is `` anomalous , ''",
    "i.e. , fundamentally different than that in regular space @xcite .",
    "the anomaly is due to the random substrate on which transport is constrained to take place .",
    "random structures are found in many places in the real world , from oil reservoirs to the internet , making the study of anomalous transport properties a far - reaching field . in this problem , it is paramount to relate the structural properties of the medium with the transport properties .",
    "an important and recent example of random substrates is that of complex networks .",
    "research on this topic has uncovered their importance for real - world problems as diverse as the world wide web and the internet to cellular networks and sexual - partner networks @xcite .",
    "two distinct models describe the two limiting cases for the structure of the complex networks .",
    "the first of these is the classic erds - rnyi model of random networks @xcite , for which sites are connected with a link with probability @xmath12 and disconnected ( no link ) with probability @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ er_diag ] ) . in this case",
    "the degree distribution @xmath14 , the probability of a node to have @xmath15 connections , is a poisson @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the average degree of the network .",
    "mathematicians discovered critical phenomena through this model .",
    "for instance , just as in percolation on lattices , there is a critical value @xmath18 above which the largest connected component of the network has a mass that scales with the system size @xmath19 , but below @xmath20 , there are only small clusters of the order of @xmath21 . another characteristic of an erds - rnyi network is its `` small - world '' property which means that the average distance @xmath22 ( or diameter ) between all pairs of nodes of the network scales as @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the other model , recently identified as the characterizing topological structure of many real world systems , is the barabsi - albert scale - free network and its extensions @xcite , characterized by a scale - free degree distribution : @xmath23 , \\label{degree}\\ ] ] the cutoff value @xmath24 represents the minimum allowed value of @xmath15 on the network ( @xmath25 here ) , and @xmath26 , the typical maximum degree of a network with @xmath19 nodes @xcite .",
    "the scale - free feature allows a network to have some nodes with a large number of links ( `` hubs '' ) , unlike the case for the erds - rnyi model of random networks @xcite .",
    "scale - free networks with @xmath27 have @xmath28 , while for @xmath29 they are `` ultra - small - world '' since the diameter scales as @xmath30 @xcite .    here",
    "we extend our recent study of transport in complex networks @xcite .",
    "we find that for scale - free networks with @xmath31 , transport properties characterized by conductance display a power - law tail distribution that is related to the degree distribution @xmath14 .",
    "the origin of this power - law tail is due to pairs of nodes of high degree which have high conductance .",
    "thus , transport in scale - free networks is better because of the presence of large degree nodes ( hubs ) that carry much of the traffic , whereas erds - rnyi networks lack hubs and the transport properties are controlled mainly by the average degree @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "also , we present a simple physical picture of transport in scale - free and erds - rnyi networks and test it through simulations . additionally , we study a form of frictionless transport , in which transport is measured by the number of independent paths between source and destination .",
    "these later results are similar to those in @xcite .",
    "the results of our study are relevant to problems of transport in scale - free networks , given that conductivity and diffusivity are related by the einstein relation @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ transport ] concentrates on the numerical calculation of the electrical conductance of networks . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] a simple physical picture gives a theoretical explanation of the results .",
    "section  [ frictionless ] deals with the number of link - independent paths as a form of transport . in sec .",
    "[ summary ] we present the conclusions and summarize the results in a coherent picture .",
    "most of the work done so far regarding complex networks has concentrated on static topological properties or on models for their growth @xcite .",
    "transport features have not been extensively studied with the exception of random walks on specific complex networks @xcite .",
    "transport properties are important because they contain information about network function @xcite . here",
    "we study the electrical conductance @xmath0 between two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 of erds - rnyi and scale - free networks when a potential difference is imposed between them .",
    "we assume that all the links have equal resistances of unit value @xcite .    to construct an erds - rnyi network ,",
    "we begin with @xmath19 nodes and connect each pair with probability @xmath12 . to generate a scale - free network with @xmath19 nodes",
    ", we use the molloy - reed algorithm @xcite , which allows for the construction of random networks with arbitrary degree distribution .",
    "we generate @xmath32 copies of each node @xmath33 , where @xmath32 is a random number taken from a distribution of the form @xmath34 .",
    "we then randomly pair these copies of the nodes in order to construct the network , making sure that two previously - linked nodes are not connected again , and also excluding links of a node to itself @xcite .",
    "we calculate the conductance @xmath0 of the network between two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 using the kirchhoff method @xcite , where entering and exiting potentials are fixed to @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we solve the set of @xmath37 linear equations @xmath38 representing the conservation of current at the nodes .",
    "the resistances @xmath39 are 1 if nodes @xmath33 and @xmath40 are connected , and infinite if @xmath33 and @xmath40 are not connected .",
    "finally , the total current @xmath41 entering at node @xmath6 and exiting at node @xmath7 is computed by adding the outgoing currents from @xmath6 to its nearest neighbors through @xmath42 , where @xmath40 runs over the neighbors of @xmath6 .",
    "first , we analyze the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath43 which comes from @xmath44 , the probability that two nodes on the network have conductance between @xmath0 and @xmath45 .",
    "to this end , we introduce the cumulative distribution @xmath46 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fg_lamb2.5 - 3.3-er_n8000](a ) for the erds - rnyi and scale - free ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath25 ) cases .",
    "we use the notation @xmath4 and @xmath49 for scale - free , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 for erds - rnyi .",
    "the function @xmath49 for both @xmath47 and 3.3 exhibits a tail region well fit by the power law @xmath52 and the exponent @xmath53 increases with @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath51 decreases exponentially with @xmath0 .    increasing @xmath19 does not significantly change @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ fg_lamb2.5 - 3.3-er_n8000](b ) ) except for an increase in the upper cutoff @xmath54 , where @xmath54 is the typical maximum conductance , corresponding to the value of @xmath0 at which @xmath55 crosses over from a power law to a faster decay .",
    "we observe no change of the exponent @xmath56 with @xmath19 .",
    "the increase of @xmath54 with @xmath19 implies that the average conductance @xmath57 over all pairs also increases slightly .",
    "we next study the origin of the large values of @xmath0 in scale - free networks and obtain an analytical relation between @xmath3 and @xmath56 .",
    "larger values of @xmath0 require the presence of many parallel paths , which we hypothesize arise from the high degree nodes .",
    "thus , we expect that if either of the degrees @xmath8 or @xmath9 of the entering and exiting nodes is small ( e.g. @xmath58 ) , the conductance @xmath0 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is small since there are at most @xmath15 different parallel branches coming out of a node with degree @xmath15 .",
    "thus , a small value of @xmath15 implies a small number of possible parallel branches , and therefore a small value of @xmath0 . to observe large @xmath0 values",
    ", it is therefore necessary that both @xmath8 and @xmath9 be large .",
    "we test this hypothesis by large scale computer simulations of the conditional pdf @xmath59 for specific values of the entering and exiting node degrees @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "consider first @xmath60 , and the effect of increasing @xmath9 , with @xmath8 fixed .",
    "we find that @xmath59 is narrowly peaked ( fig .",
    "[ pgka750_kb4 - 128_n8000_ab7_lamb2.5](a ) ) so that it is well characterized by @xmath61 , the value of @xmath0 when @xmath62 is a maximum .",
    "we find similar results for erds - rnyi networks .",
    "further , for increasing @xmath9 , we find [ fig .",
    "[ pgka750_kb4 - 128_n8000_ab7_lamb2.5](b ) ] @xmath61 increases as @xmath63 , with @xmath64 consistent with the possibility that as @xmath65 , @xmath66 which we assume henceforth .",
    "for the case of @xmath67 , @xmath61 increases less fast than @xmath9 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ g_over_kb_vs_ka_over_kb_combi_n8000_lamb2.5_ab7_m2 ] where we plot @xmath68 against the scaled degree @xmath69 .",
    "the collapse of @xmath68 for different values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicates that @xmath61 scales as @xmath70 below we study the possible origin of this function .",
    "the behavior of the scaling function @xmath71 can be interpreted using the following simplified `` transport backbone '' picture [ fig .",
    "[ g_over_kb_vs_ka_over_kb_combi_n8000_lamb2.5_ab7_m2 ] inset ] , for which the effective conductance @xmath0 between nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfies @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the resistance of the `` transport backbone '' while @xmath74 ( and @xmath75 ) are the resistances of the set of links near node @xmath6 ( and node @xmath7 ) not belonging to the `` transport backbone '' .",
    "it is plausible that @xmath76 is linear in @xmath8 , so we can write @xmath77 . since node @xmath7 is equivalent to node @xmath6 , we expect @xmath78 .",
    "hence @xmath79 so the scaling function defined in eq .  ( [ g_max_scaled ] ) is @xmath80 the second equality follows if there are many parallel paths on the `` transport backbone '' so that @xmath81 @xcite . the prediction ( [ e4b ] ) is plotted in fig .",

    "the agreement of ( [ e4b ] ) with simulations has a striking implication : the conductance of a scale - free and erds - rnyi networks depends on only one quantity @xmath10 .",
    "further , since the distribution of fig .",

    "for instance , a complete graph has conductance @xmath84 which , if compared to eq .",
    "( [ gh ] ) , indicates that indeed @xmath85 .",
    "this suggests testing @xmath10 as a function of the average degree @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "[ c_vs_lambda2.5 - 4.5_and_er_8000 ] we present results for both scale - free and erds - rnyi networks .",
    "the most important feature is that there seems to be a power - law decay of @xmath86 with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "we find that the dependence is of the form @xmath87 , with @xmath88 for erds - rnyi and @xmath89 for scale - free . also , we observe that @xmath10 for erds - rnyi networks , at least in the region of @xmath11 studied , is lower than for scale - free networks .",
    "as @xmath11 increases , transport on scale - free networks becomes increasingly better than in erds - rnyi networks , because @xmath10 is closer to one for the same @xmath11 .    within this `` transport backbone '' picture",

    "( [ g_g_measured ] ) .",

    "in many systems , it is the nature of the transport process that the particles flowing through the network links experience no friction . for example , this is the case in an electrical system made of super - conductors @xcite , or in the case of water flow along pipes , if frictional effects are minor .",
    "other examples are flow of cars along traffic routes , and perhaps most important , the transport of information in communication networks .",
    "common to all these processes is that , the quality of the transport is determined by the number of link - independent paths leading from the source to the destination ( and the capacity of each path ) , and not by the length of each path ( as is the case for simple electrical conductance ) . in this section ,",
    "we focus on non - weighted networks , and define the conductance , as the number of link - independent paths between a given source and destination @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we name this transport process as the _ max - flow model _ , and denote the conductance as @xmath103",
    ". fast algorithms for solving the max - flow problem , given a network and a pair @xmath104 are well known within the computer science community @xcite .",
    "we apply those methods to random scale - free and erds - rnyi networks , and observe similarities and differences from the electrical conductance transport model .",
    "max - flow analysis has been applied recently for complex networks in general @xcite , and for the internet in particular @xcite , where it was used as a significant tool in the structural analysis of the underlying network .",
    "we find , that in the max - flow model , just as in the electrical conductance case , scale - free networks exhibit a power - law decay of the distribution of conductances with the same exponent ( and thus very high conductance values are possible ) , while in erds - rnyi networks , the conductance decays exponentially ( fig .",
    "[ flow_cumulative_distribution](a ) ) . in order to better understand this behavior , we plot the scaled - flow @xmath105 as a function of the scaled - degree @xmath106 ( fig .  [ flow_cumulative_distribution](b ) ) .",
    "it can be seen that the transition at @xmath107 is sharp . for all @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , @xmath110 ( or @xmath111 ) , while for @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , @xmath114 ( or @xmath115 ) . in other words",
    ", the conductance simply equals the minimum of the degrees of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the symbols of eq .",
    "( [ gh ] ) , this also implies that @xmath116 ; i.e. scale - free networks are optimal for transport in the max - flow sense .",
    "the derivation leading to eq .",
    "( [ phig ] ) becomes then exact , so that the distribution of conductances is given again by @xmath117 .",
    "this picture of the transport is seen when the minimum degree in the network is @xmath118 . when the minimum degree is allowed to take values in the range between 1 and 2  @xcite , we find that @xmath119 , but the two quantities are no longer equal .",
    "this reflects the fact that as the minimum network degree is lowered , the network becomes more dilute , such that two paths starting at the source might intersect at some link inside the backbone .",
    "in other words , the conductance of the backbone is still high , but no longer infinite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ flow_kmin](a ) , where we plot the average conductance @xmath120 vs. the minimum degree of the source and sink @xmath121 , and find that while the relation between the two variables is linear , the slope is not necessarily 1 .",
    "nevertheless , as @xmath122 approaches 2 , the slope becomes 1 , which indicates that a sufficient condition for the network to have infinite backbone conductivity is @xmath123 .",
    "this is illustrated again in fig .",
    "[ flow_kmin](b ) , where the distribution of conductance values @xmath103 for fixed @xmath121 is plotted .",
    "we have so far observed that the max - flow model is quite similar to electrical conductance , by means of having a finite possibility of finding very high values of conductance .",
    "also , the fact that the minimum degree plays a dominant role in the number of link - independent paths makes the scaling behavior of the electrical and frictionless problems similar .",
    "only when the conductances are studied as a function of distance , some differences between the electrical and frictionless cases begin to emerge . in fig ,",
    "[ flow_distance](a ) , we plot the dependence of the average conductance @xmath120 with respect to the minimum degree @xmath124 of the source and sink , for different values of the shortest distance @xmath125 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and find that @xmath120 is independent of @xmath125 as the curves for different @xmath125 overlap .",
    "this result is a consequence of the frictionless character of the max - flow problem .",
    "however , when we consider the electrical case , this independence disappears .",
    "this is illustrated in fig ,  [ flow_distance](b ) , where @xmath57 is also plotted against the minimum degree @xmath124 , but in this case , curves with different @xmath125 no longer overlap . from the plot we find that @xmath57 decreases as the distance increases .",
    "this is explained using the observation of @xcite , that the average shortest distance between the source and the sink is inversely proportional to the ( logarithm of the product ) of their degrees .",
    "thus , on average , shorter distances are attributed to higher degrees , which in turn are connected by larger conductance .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that the dependence of @xmath57 with respect to @xmath125 is slower than linear .    in order to test the validity of our results in real networks",
    ", we measured the conductance @xmath126 on the most up to date map of the autonomous systems ( as ) level of the internet structure  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ flow_internet ] we find that the slope of the plot , which corresponds to @xmath99 from eq .",
    "( [ phig ] ) , is approximately 2.3 , implying that @xmath127 .",
    "this value of @xmath3 is in good agreement with the value of the degree distribution exponent for the internet observed in  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we find that the conductance of scale - free networks is highly heterogeneous , and depends strongly on the degree of the two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "our results suggest that the transport constants are also heterogeneous in these networks , and depend on the degrees of the starting and ending nodes .",
    "we also find a power - law tail for @xmath128 and relate the tail exponent @xmath56 to the exponent @xmath3 of the degree distribution @xmath14 .",
    "this power law behavior makes scale - free networks better for transport .",
    "our work is consistent with a simple physical picture of how transport takes place in scale - free and erds - rnyi networks .",
    "this , so called `` transport backbone '' picture consists of the nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 and their vicinities , and the rest of the network , which constitutes the transport backbone . because of the great number of parallel paths contained in the transport backbone , transport takes place inside with very small resistance , and therefore the dominating effect of resistance comes from the vicinity of the node ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) with the smallest degree .",
    "this scenario appears to be valid for both the electrical and frictionless models , as clearly indicated by the similarity in the results .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 , which characterizes transport for a complex network exhibits a behavior of the form @xmath129 for both scale - free and erds - rnyi networks in the electrical model , and in the frictionless model @xmath130 in most cases .",
    "we observe that as @xmath11 increases , scale - free networks become progressively better than erds - rnyi networks in electrical transport .",
    "finally , we point out that our study can be extended further . for instance",
    ", it has been found recently that many real - world scale - free networks possess fractal properties @xcite . however , random scale - free and erds - rnyi networks , which are the subject of this study , do not display fractality .",
    "since fractal substrates also lead to anomalous transport @xcite , it would be interesting to explore the effect of fractality on transport and conductance in fractal networks .",
    "this case is expected to have anomalous effects due to both the heterogeneity of the degree distribution and to the fractality of the network .",
    "furthermore , the effect on conductivity and transport of the correlation between distance of two nodes and their degree @xcite should be further investigated .",
