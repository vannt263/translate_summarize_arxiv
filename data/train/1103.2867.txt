    "understanding anomalous transport in magnetically confined plasmas is an outstanding issue in controlled fusion research .",
    "a satisfactorily understanding of the non - local features as well as the non - gaussian probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) found in experimental measurements of particle and heat fluxes is still lacking . in particular , experimental observations of the edge turbulence in the fusion devices @xcite show that in the scrape of layer ( sol ) the plasma fluctuations are characterized by non - gaussian pdfs .",
    "it has been recognized that the nature of the cross - field transport through the sol is dominated by turbulence with a significant ballistic or non - local component where a diffusive description is improper @xcite .",
    "moreover , the scaling of the confinement time @xmath0 with @xmath1 @xcite is typical in low - confinement mode discharges , instead of the diffusion induced result @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the system size .",
    "there is a considerable amount of experimental evidence @xcite and recent numerical gyrokinetic @xcite and fluid @xcite simulations that plasma turbulence in tokamaks is highly non - local .",
    "in addition , intermittent turbulence is characterized by patchy spatial structure that is bursty in time .",
    "the pdfs of these intermittent events shows unimodal structure with `` elevated '' tails that deviates from a gaussian prediction .",
    "the understanding of these events are at best limited @xcite .",
    "moreover , the high possibility of confinement degradation by intermittency strongly calls for a predictive theory .    a prominent candidate for explaining the suggestive non - local features of plasma turbulence is the inclusion of a fractional velocity derivative in the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation leading to an inherently non - local description as well as giving rise to non - gaussian pdfs of e.g. densities and heat flux .",
    "the non - locality is introduced through the integral description of the fractional derivative @xcite and the non - maxwellian distribution function drives the observed pdfs of densities and heat flux far from gaussian .",
    "the aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of a non - maxwellian distribution function induced by the fractional velocity derivative in the fokker - planck equation .",
    "some previous papers on plasma transport have used models including a fractional derivative where the fractional derivative is introduced on phenomenological premises @xcite . in the present work",
    "we introduce the levy statistics into the langevin equation thus yielding a fractional fp description .",
    "this approach is similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite resulting in a phenomenological description of the non - local effects in plasma turbulence . using fractional generalizations of the liouville equation ,",
    "kinetic descriptions have been developed previously @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the chaotic dynamics can be described by using the fp equation with coordinate fractional derivatives as a possible tool for the description of anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "much work has been devoted on investigation of the langevin equation with levy white noise , see references @xcite , or related fractional fp equation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fractional derivatives have been introduced into the fp framework in a similar manner as the present work @xcite but a study including drift waves is still called for . to this end",
    "we quantify the effects of the fractional derivative in the fp equation in terms of a modified dispersion relation for density gradient driven linear plasma drift waves where we have considered a case with constant external magnetic field and a shear - less slab geometry . in order to calculate an equilibrium pdf we use a model based on the motion of a charged levy particle in a constant external magnetic field obeying non - gaussian , levy statistics .",
    "this assumption is the natural generalization of the classical example of the motion of a charged brownian particle with the usual gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "the fractional derivative is represented with the fourier transform containing a fractional exponent .",
    "we find a relation for the deviation from maxwellian distribution described by @xmath4 through the quasi - neutrality condition and the characteristics of the plasma drift wave are fundamentally changed , i.e. the values of the growth - rate @xmath5 and real frequency @xmath6 are significantly altered .",
    "a deviation from the maxwellian distribution function alters the dispersion relation for the density gradient drift waves such that the growth rates are substantially increased and thereby may cause enhanced levels of transport .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the mathematical framework of the fractional fp equation ( ffpe ) is introduced . in sec .",
    "3 a dispersion relation for the density gradient driven drift modes using the ffpe are derived . in sec 4",
    "the deviations from a maxwellian distribution function are investigated and the dispersion relation is solved in sec .",
    "we conclude the paper with a results and discussion in sec .",
    "following the theory of brownian motion we write an equation of motion for a colloidal particle in a background medium as a langevin equation of the following form @xcite @xmath7 here , we assumed that the influence of the background medium can be split into a dynamical friction , @xmath8 , and a fluctuating part , @xmath9 which is a gaussian white noise . the gaussian white noise assumption is usually imposed in order to obtain a maxwellian velocity distribution describing the equilibrium of the brownian particle .",
    "this connection is due to the relation between the gaussian central limit theorem and classical boltzmann - gibbs statistics @xcite .",
    "however , the gaussian central limit theorem is not unique and a generalization of the gaussian central limit theorem to the case of summation of independent identically distributed random variables described by long tailed distributions is performed by lvy @xcite , and khintchine @xcite . in this case",
    "the lvy distributions replace the gaussian in a generalized central limit theorem .    the simplest case of generalized brownian motion considered by west and seshadri @xcite is to assume for fluctuation part , @xmath9 , in equation ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) to be a white lvy noise . following the approach used by barkai @xcite",
    "we find the fractional fokker - planck equation ( ffpe ) with fractional velocity derivatives for shear - less slab geometry in the presence of a constant external force as @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the particle species and @xmath12 . here , the term @xmath13 is the fractional riesz derivative .",
    "the fractional differentiation may be represented through singular integrals or by its fourier transform as we will see later in equation ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) .",
    "note that the connection to the integral representation indicates that the model is inherently non - local in velocity space .",
    "the diffusion coefficient , @xmath14 , is related to the damping term @xmath15 , according to a generalized einstein relation @xcite @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is a generalized temperature , and taking force @xmath18 to represent the lorentz force ( due to a constant magnetic field and a zero - averaged electric field ) acting on the particles of species @xmath19 with mass @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the euler gamma function .",

    "we can rewrite the kinetic equation by identification of time derivatives of the wave vectors as @xmath29 we use the method of characteristics on the equation ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.6 ] ) whereby we find that the characteristics are @xmath30 following the method used in ref .",

    "<S> transport events in turbulent tokamak plasmas often exhibit non - local or non - diffusive action at a distance features that so far have eluded a conclusive theoretical description . in this paper a theory of non - local transport is investigated through a fokker - planck equation with fractional velocity derivatives . a dispersion relation for density gradient driven linear drift modes </S>",
    "<S> is derived including the effects of the fractional velocity derivative in the fokker - planck equation . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a small deviation ( a few percent ) from the maxwellian distribution function alters the dispersion relation such that the growth rates are substantially increased and thereby may cause enhanced levels of transport . </S>"
