    "due to the large format of the _ galex _ images , star - forming regions were searched for across the whole hi tail .",
    "we set the parameter detect@xmath22thresh to 1.5@xmath23 over the background in the nuv image .",
    "we chose 1.5@xmath23 since larger @xmath23 would cause blending with other sources when using se automatic apertures . at the end , we had a catalog with ra and dec of each object in the fuv and nuv bands . with this information in hand",

    "nuv magnitudes were corrected by aperture effects by using the task mkapfile in iraf . in order to do that , we used the catalog of all the sources available in our field , which is provided by the _ galex _ pipeline . in that catalog , we searched for star - like objects with magnitudes between 15@xmath25nuv , fuv@xmath2518 ( i. e. non - saturated objects ) .",
    "we used a minimum aperture of 4  and a maximum one of 60  .",
    "this give us a correction of fuv=-0.36@xmath40.02 and nuv=-0.48@xmath40.03 .",
    "in the case of the r - band image , the aperture correction was r=-0.03@xmath40.01 .",
    "due to its small value ( similar to the error determination in the r - band magnitudes ) we do not take the latter correction into account .",
    "magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction , using a@xmath10=e(b - v)@xmath118.29 , a@xmath14=e(b - v)@xmath118.18 ( seibert et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we note that due to the _ galex _ spatial resolution , we can not resolve all of our uv detected regions . in most cases , one uv source will most probably be associated with more than one hii region .",
    "the optical r - band image will help disentangling the multiple sources .",
    "once the uv - emitting sources were identified , we used the r - band image to obtain the magnitudes . for r - band magnitudes",
    ", we used a fixed aperture of 4 \" radius centered on the uv _ galex _ emission .",
    "r - band magnitudes were corrected by galactic extinction using the savage & mathis ( 1979 ) extinction law and the e(b - v ) given by schelegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .      for each region",
    ", ages were estimated from the fuv - nuv and fuv - r observed colors and the models given by sb99 .",
    "for these models , which were tuned for the _ galex _ and r - band filters , we used an instantaneous burst , a salpeter initial mass function ( imf , 0.1 to 100 m@xmath3 ) and a solar metallicity .",
    "models were generated from 1 myr to 1 gyr .",
    "it is important to note that for low - mass stellar associations , the observed broad - band colors can be affected by an incomplete sampling of the imf ( effect that is not taken into account by the sb99 models , which assume a fully sampled imf ) .",
    "this fact could produce uncertainties in the dating of low - mass systems ( see cervio et al .",
    "2003 , cervio & valls - gabaud 2003 , hancock et al .",
    "2008 , popescu & hanson 2010 and da silva et al .",

    ") of each star - forming region , two extinction laws have been applied on the theoretical colors , the starburst law given by calzetti et al .",

    "( 2005 ) ( 8.29 and 8.18 , respectively ) and a@xmath26=2.74 was taken from savage & mathis ( 1979 ) .",
    "one of the main problems in the study of star formation in young clusters is the uncertainty in the value of the internal dust correction . since there are no infrared data for the clusters , we have estimated ages and extinctions simultaneously by fitting the observed fuv - nuv and fuv - r colors to the theoretical ones through a @xmath27 minimization calculation .",
    "errors on ages were estimated at a confidence level of 68@xmath28 , in a similar way as presented by smith et al .",
    "we note that the ages and e(b - v ) used throughout this paper correspond to the values that minimized the @xmath27 independent if a starburst or mw extinction law was assumed .",
    "errors on e(b - v ) are of the order of 0.3 mag .",
    "we have followed the method used in de mello et al .",
    "( 2008a ) to estimate the mass of our candidates . basically , we used the ages and the fuv luminosities of each region to estimate the stellar masses with sb99 .",
    "the stellar masses were obtained from sb99 s monochromatic luminosity , l@xmath29 , for an instantaneous burst , salpeter imf ( from 0.1 to 100 m@xmath3 ) and solar metallicity . since",
    "all our candidates present young ages , we note that the luminosities in l@xmath29 are dominated by the contribution of massive stars .      in the _ sdss _ database we located a calibrated spectrum for one compact object in an arc along a ripple close to the main body of ngc 2782 .",
    "due to its large spectral coverage ( from 3800 to 9220  ) we can correct this spectrum for reddening using the balmer emission lines .",
    "the value for the intrinsic h@xmath19/h@xmath30 ratio was taken from brocklehurst ( 1971 ) for an t@xmath31=10000 k and n@xmath31=100 .",
    "the spectrum was then corrected using a c@xmath32=0.85 , using the cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) milky way extinction law .",
    "gemini / gmos archival spectroscopic data were available for five objects in the gaseous tidal tail of ngc 2782 ( data recently used by werk et al .",
    "2011 ) , three of which coincided with some of the regions measured by us in this study ( regions 5 , 6 and 7 .",
    "we used the task emsao of the package rvsao in iraf to estimate the radial velocity of the objects .",
    "galactic extinction was calculated using the model by amores & lepine ( 2005 ) , resulting in a e(b - v)=0.08 .",
    "the intrinsic reddening of each region was assumed to be that derived in  3.3 ( see table [ table1 ] ) , given the large uncertainties in the flux estimation of the h@xmath33 line .",
    "galactic and intrinsic corrections were performed using the idl code fm_unred by fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) .",
    "we estimated the equivalent width of the h@xmath30 line for the three regions with gemini / gmos spectroscopic data . using the observed and synthetic ew(h@xmath30 ) derived from sb99 , we estimated the age of each region , assuming a single stellar population",
    ". we also measured the [ oii ] @xmath63726@xmath34 , [ oiii ] @xmath64959@xmath34 and [ oiii ] @xmath65007@xmath34 line fluxes relative to the h@xmath30 line .",
    "using these values we estimated the oxygen abundance using the r@xmath35 method defined by edmunds & pagel ( 1984 , as shown in fig . 2 of torres - peimbert , peimbert & fierro 1989 ) .",
    "although the r@xmath35 is a well studied calibrator that depends on the fine - tuning between oxygen abundance and electron temperature , it has the disadvantage that it is double valued , presenting an upper and lower branch i. e. for a given value of r@xmath35 , there are two values for the metallicity ( see figure 9 in mcgaugh 1991 ) .",
    "this can be explained because at low metallicities , the cooling of the hii region is dominated by collisionally excited lyman @xmath19 emission . while the metallicity increases , the contribution of oxygen to cooling is higher . optical forbidden lines are very important at values of 12+log(o / h)@xmath08.4 . beyond that , infrared fine - structure lines dominate the cooling ( mcgaugh 1991 ) .",
    "one way to solve the double valued problem would be by using the ratio between [ nii ] and [ oii ] , however , for none of the regions in the tail we have spectra with enough dynamic range to see these two lines .",
    "further discussion on this point is given in  4.2 .",
    "we also estimated the oxygen abundance using the results found by pilyugin ( 2001a ) , who used an empirical approach , which is optimized for high metallicity hii regions . in spite of the method shown by pilyugin ( 2001a ) being optimized for high metallicity hii regions , van zee et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that when this method is compared with direct abundances calculations , the residuals of that comparison seem to be correlated with the ionization parameter of the hii regions .",
    "van zee et al . ( 2006 ) found that this systematic trend does not exist in the case of the semi - empirical method shown in mcgaugh ( 1991 ) .",
    "for this reason , we have also used this latter method to estimate the oxygen abundance of the star - forming regions to compare the results with the other methods mentioned above .    in the case of the _ sdss _ spectrum , which does not have the [ oii ] line",
    ", we estimated the oxygen abundance by using the n2 method ( denicol , terlevich & terlevich 2002 ) .",
