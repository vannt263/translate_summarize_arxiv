    "at atmospheric pressure y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) , similarly to the rare - earth manganites @xmath11mno@xmath2 , for @xmath11 with smaller ionic radius ( @xmath11  =  ho , er , tm , yb , lu ) crystallizes in the hexagonal @xmath12 structure whereas the orthorhombic , distorted perovskite structure is the stable phase for y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 with @xmath13.@xcite upon annealing under high pressure , some hexagonal manganites , such as ymno@xmath2 and homno@xmath2 , can be converted to their orthorhombic @xmath14 phase.@xcite the ca- and sr - doped orthorhombic rare - earth manganites have been a subject of intensive studies since the phenomenon `` colossal magnetoresistance''(cmr ) has been rediscovered.@xcite to our knowledge , there are however no reports on the synthesis and properties of doped yttrium - based orthorhombic manganites for @xmath15 .",
    "the y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 orthorhombic system is of particular interest as it could be compared to the model la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 system , where ca doping and conversion of part of the jahn - teller mn@xmath16 ions in non - jahn - teller mn@xmath17 ions results in a complex magnetic phase diagram and strong interplay between structural , magnetic and transport properties .    in this work",
    "we report the synthesis of orthorhombic series y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and first results on the variations with @xmath4 of structural parameters , resistivity , magnetic properties and raman spectra over the doping range @xmath3 .",
    "the lattice parameters change systematically with @xmath4 .",
    "although there are strong indications for increasing disorder above @xmath5 , the average structure remains orthorhombic in the whole substitutional range .",
    "ca doping increases conductivity , but the temperature dependence of the resistivity @xmath6(t ) remains semiconducting for all @xmath4 .",
    "it was found , however , that the average magnetic exchange interaction changes from antiferromagnetic for @xmath7 to ferromagnetic for @xmath8 . the evolution with @xmath4 of the raman spectra provide strong indications for increasingly disordered oxygen sublattice at @xmath18 ,",
    "presumably due to quasistatic and/or dynamical jahn - teller distortions .",
    "as a first step in samples preparation , ceramic pellets of hexagonal y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath4 = 0.00 , 0.03 , 0.06 , 0.10 and 0.20 ) and orthorhombic y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath4 = 0.30 and 0.50 ) were synthesized by solid state reaction",
    ". the prescribed amounts of y@xmath19o@xmath2 , caco@xmath2 , and mn@xmath19o@xmath2 were mixed and preheated at 900 to 1000@xmath20 c in oxygen for 16 hours followed by sintering at 1140 to 1170@xmath20c for one day under oxygen atmosphere .",
    "the hexagonal samples were resintered in a high pressure furnace under 35 kbar at 1015 to 1030  @xmath20c for 5  h. under these conditions the hexagonal phase was completely transformed into the metastable orthorhombic structure .",
    "the x - ray - diffraction ( xrd ) pattern were collected at room temperature using a rigaku dmaxiii / b x - ray diffractometer .",
    "magnetization measurements were conducted employing the mpms squid magnetometer ( quantum design ) at an external field of 500  oe . the dc resistivity was measured by the standard four - probe method using a keithley  220 current source and a keithley  182 nanovoltmeter .",
    "the raman spectra were obtained at room temperature using a hr640 spectrometer equipped with microscope , notch filters and liquid - nitrogen - cooled ccd detector .",
    "514.5  nm and 632.8 laser lines , focused with an @xmath21 objective on the sample s surface in a spot of ( 2 - 3  @xmath22 m ) diameter , were used for excitation . for the most samples the size of the the microcrystals constituting the pellet was larger than the laser spot , which made it possible to select microcrystals with proper orientation of crystallographic axes with respect to incident polarization and obtain polarized spectra in nearly exact scattering configurations .",
    "the x - ray spectra of y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 are shown in fig.1 for @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "all reflections can be indexed within the orthorhombic symmetry , space group @xmath14 .",
    "the absence of impurity lines proves the high phase purity and the success of the high - pressure synthesis in stabilizing the @xmath14 structure for the ca content between 0 and 0.5 .",
    "a remarkable broadening of the x - ray lines is observed above @xmath25 that indicates an increased disorder of the cations at higher substitution , @xmath4 .",
    "the lattice constants change systematically with @xmath4 , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "the largest change is the decrease of @xmath26 by up to 7% at @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath27-axis is almost not affected by the ca doping .",
    "the @xmath28-axis shows a distinct , but moderate increase from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , the total change being no more than 1.5% .",
    "the systematic change of the lattice constants with @xmath4 and the absence of impurity lines in the x - ray spectra unambiguously prove that the ca ions in fact replace the y ions in the perovskite - like structure of y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "our values of the lattice parameters are in good agreement with data of recent publications for @xmath23 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath24 ( included in fig.2 as symbols).@xcite recent neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) experiments@xcite estimated a considerably longer @xmath26-axis ( 5.97    as compared with 5.857    of the present investigation ) .",
    "the discrepancy is probably due to the excess oxygen reported for the npd samples .",

    "the conductivity of the doped compound should increase with @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the room temperature conductivity of ortho - ymno@xmath2 increases by a factor of about 300 between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "the characteristic temperature dependence of the resistivity , @xmath6(t ) , is semiconducting for all @xmath34 .",

    "the inverse magnetic susceptibility exhibits a curie - weiss - like linear temperature dependence at t  @xmath36  k and a sharp anomaly at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature , t@xmath37  k. from the high - temperature data the paramagnetic curie temperature and the effective magnetic moment per mn  ion are estimated as @xmath38  k and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the effective moment is close to the value of 4.9  @xmath40 for the free mn@xmath16 ion ( spin only , s=2 ) .",
    "the values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are in good agreement with those reported in ref.@xcite(-67 k , 4.98@xmath40 ) , but deviate significantly from the recent results ( -26 k , 3.69@xmath40 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "we attribute the latter discrepancy to the presence of a significant amount of hexagonal ymno@xmath2 and excess oxygen in the samples of ref.@xcite .",
    "the high - pressure synthesized specimens used in the present investigation are of high phase purity .",
    "the clear decrease of the magnetic susceptibility below t@xmath43 is a further indication that the composition of the compound is close to stoichiometric .",
    "deviations from stoichiometry ( e.g. excess oxygen ) will result in the presence of mn@xmath17 ions with a paramagnetic contribution to the susceptibility that can easily be detected below t@xmath43 .",
    "the doping of ortho - ymno@xmath2 with ca@xmath44 results in a change of magnetic properties .",
    "up to @xmath30 the high - temperature susceptibility still exhibits curie - weiss behavior ( fig .",
    "4 ) . with increasing @xmath4 the effective moment changes very little but @xmath41 increases rapidly from -55  k ( @xmath23 ) to + 63",
    "k at @xmath30 .",
    "5 shows @xmath41 as function of @xmath4 .",
    "the paramagnetic curie temperature crosses zero close to 8% of ca doping .",
    "the change of sign of @xmath41 indicates a change of the average magnetic exchange interaction from antiferromagnetic ( afm , @xmath45 ) to ferromagnetic ( fm , @xmath46 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "5 . this change is a consequence of the presence of mn@xmath17 ions for @xmath47 . for @xmath23 the magnetic exchange of two neighboring mn@xmath16",
    "is mediated by the oxygen ions between them and is ascribed to the superexchange mechanism with a resulting afm coupling of the moments . with ca doping mn@xmath17 ions",
    "are created .",
    "these mn@xmath17 ions do not participate in the superexchange interaction but open the double exchange interaction channel whenever they are next to an mn@xmath16 .",
    "the double exchange is ferromagnetic in its nature because of a gain in kinetic energy ( the hole at the mn@xmath17 can hop to the neighboring mn@xmath16 ) if the magnetic moments of both mn - ions are parallel .",
    "this explains the gradual crossover of the paramagnetic curie temperature from negative to positive values with increasing @xmath4 as estimated from the high - t susceptibility data .",
    "note that @xmath41 obtained from the data shown in fig.5 is an effective quantity , characteristic for the average response to field and temperature of all mn  moments , those coupled by afm superexchange as well as those coupled by fm double exchange interactions to their respective neighbors .",
    "our data clearly demonstrate that ca doping of orthorhombic ymno@xmath2 is a powerful tool to tune the spin correlations from afm superexchange to predominatly fm double exchange correlations",
    ". however , the increasing fm spin coupling does not introduce ferromagnetic lang range order down to the lowest temperatures in agreement with recent results for x=0.3.@xcite the low temperature afm neel transition of ortho - ymno@xmath2 is also affected by the ca doping .",
    "the relative enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility below t@xmath43 for @xmath47 ( as compared to @xmath23 ) is an indication of the presence of mn@xmath17 ions and their paramagnetic contribution to the spin susceptibility .",
    "the neel temperature decreases with increasing @xmath4 due to a gradual reduction of the afm superexchange correlations ( fig .",
    "the afm transition is sharp up to @xmath25 , but it broadens at higher doping levels .",
    "only data for t@xmath43 up to @xmath25 have therefore been included in the figure .",
    "the broadening of the magnetic transition above @xmath25 is consistent with the observed broadening of the x - ray reflections and the raman bands ( see next section ) ) and with the model of short range ferromagnetism and a spin glass state proposed recently for x=0.3.@xcite it indicates the increasing influence of disorder on the physical properties of ortho - y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",

    "the variations with @xmath4 of the spectra of y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , measured with parallel ( hh ) and crossed ( hv ) scattering configurations , are shown in fig.7 .",
    "the hh configuration is close to @xmath48 and the raman lines correspond to modes of @xmath49 symmetry .",
    "the modes allowed with the hv ( nearly @xmath50 ) configuration are of @xmath51 symmetry .    as it follows from fig.7 , within the doping range @xmath52 the line widths moderately increase with @xmath4 , but their position and relative intensity remain practically unchanged .",
    "at @xmath53 there is a visible increase in intensity of the high frequency hh band at 644  @xmath54 and the hv band at 654  @xmath54 . for @xmath55",
    "these bands broaden , increase further in intensity and shift towards lower wavenumbers along with the bands originating from the 496  @xmath54(@xmath49 ) and 617  @xmath54(@xmath51 ) lines . at @xmath56 the overall intensity of the spectra is reduced .",
    "the hv spectrum consists of only two broad bands centered at 495  @xmath54 and 624  @xmath54 . except for broad bands close to these positions ,",
    "the corresponding hh spectrum contains two additional weak bands at lower wavenumbers .",
    "the evolution of the hv spectrum between @xmath53 and @xmath56 is given in more detail in fig.8 .",
    "no raman bands of detectable intensity are observed for @xmath24 .    .",
    "the assignment of raman lines to particular atomic motions is given in ref.@xcite.,width=288 ]     of the raman spectra of y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",

    "it has been argued that at higher doping levels the spectral profiles reflect smeared partial phonon density - of - states ( pdos ) related to oxygen vibrations rather than broadened @xmath61-point raman allowed phonon modes .",
    "indeed , the coexistence in doped manganites of jahn - teller - distorted ( mn@xmath16o@xmath62 ) and undistorted ( mn@xmath17o@xmath62 ) octahedra and the mn@xmath63 mn@xmath17 charge transfer results in strong quasistatic or / and dynamical jahn - teller disorder of the oxygen sublattice .",
    "the loss of translational symmetry activates otherwise raman forbidden oxygen vibrations , corresponding to the off - center phonon modes in ordered parent compound . in support of this model",
    "are : ( i ) the good correspondence between experimental raman profiles and calculated smeared pdos ; ( ii ) the consistent explanation of the similarities between the raman spectra of manganites with different average structure ( orthorhombic or rhombohedral ) ; ( iii ) the strong reduction or disappearance of the broad bands below the insulator - to - metal transition in the cmr materials .",
    "our results support the assumption for dominant role of jahn - teller - disorder - induced bands in the raman spectra of heavily doped orthorhombic manganites .",
    "indeed , the raman spectrum of undoped ymno@xmath2 is well understood and the @xmath49 line at 519  @xmath54 and the @xmath51 line at 617  @xmath54 correspond to the highest @xmath49 and @xmath51 modes , respectively.@xcite therefore , the relatively weak band at 653 - 658  @xmath54 , observed in the hh and hv spectra of ymno@xmath2 , can not be a proper raman mode for the @xmath14 structure , but is rather due to contributions from zone - boundary phonons .",
    "this is consistent with lattice dynamical calculations , which predict for both ymno@xmath2 and lamno@xmath2 the strongest pdos peak close to this frequency.@xcite this structure and another one near 490  @xmath54 , where a pdos maximum is also predicted , grow in relative weight with increasing @xmath4 and become dominant at @xmath56 , while the lines related to @xmath61-point raman modes , involving mainly oxygen motions are diminishing .",
    "this is exactly what one expects upon loss of translation symmetry with increasing oxygen disorder .",
    "it is worth noting that the cationic sublattice also exhibits increasing disorder at higher @xmath4 , indicated by noticeable broadening of the x - ray diffraction patterns for @xmath56 and @xmath64 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the x - ray patterns gain their intensities mainly from the y , ca and mn atoms and to a lesser extent from the light oxygen atoms , which justifies such conclusion .",
    "we have successfully prepared orthorhombic y@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 in a wide doping range between @xmath23 and @xmath24 using high - pressure synthesis . between @xmath23 and @xmath29 the orthorhombic structure",
    "was stabilized as a metastable phase .",
    "the lattice parameters change gradually with @xmath4 over the whole doping range .",
    "the ca doping increases the conductivity , but its temperature dependence remains semiconducting for all @xmath4 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility for @xmath65 exhibits the typical paramagnetic curie dependence at high temperatures ( @xmath66  k ) .",
    "the paramagnetic curie temperature is negative for small @xmath4 , crosses zero at @xmath67 and becomes positive at larger @xmath4 .",
    "this is interpreted as a gradual change of the magnetic correlations from antiferromagnetic superexchange ( @xmath45 ) to ferromagnetic double exchange interactions ( @xmath46 ) due to the replacement of mn@xmath16 with mn@xmath17 with increasing ca doping .",
    "the evolution with @xmath4 of the raman spectra provide strong indications for increasing disorder of the oxygen sublattice for @xmath9 , presumably due to quasistatic and/or dynamic jahn - teller distortions . as a consequence of the loss of translational symmetry and activation of otherwise forbidden vibrations ,",
    "the relatively broad bands in the raman spectra for high substitution levels reflect rather the phonon density of states than the raman allowed zone center phonons .",
