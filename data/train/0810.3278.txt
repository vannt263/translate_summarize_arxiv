    "magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process of breaking and topological rearrangement of magnetic field lines in magnetized plasmas .",
    "reconnection converts magnetic energy into kinetic and thermal energy and is believed to be responsible for many phenomena observed in the laboratory and cosmic plasmas  @xcite . because electrical resistivity is very low in hot plasmas , magnetic reconnection due to resistive dissipation of magnetic field is typically a very slow process  @xcite .",
    "reconnection can become much faster in the case when resistivity is anomalously high due to local plasma instabilities  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is fast reconnection made possible because of two - fluid plasma effects  @xcite , which require a two - fluid magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) description of plasma . in the limit of zero electron - to - ion mass ratio ,",
    "two - fluid mhd equations simplify and reduce to hall - mhd equations .",
    "the later include the hall and electron pressure terms in the ohm s law , in addition to the resistivity term present in single - fluid mhd . because of its relative simplicity ,",
    "hall - mhd description of plasma has been extensively used in numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection  @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , a simple self - consistent analytical model of hall reconnection , similar to the classical sweet - parker model of resistive reconnection , has not been constructed . in this paper",
    "we consider hall - mhd equations and present a theoretical model of hall reconnection .",
    "full two - fluid calculations for magnetic reconnection will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the analytical derivations of this paper are similar to the derivations done by @xcite for the case of resistive single - fluid mhd reconnection .",
    "for simplicity and brevity , we use physical units in which the speed of light @xmath3 and four times @xmath4 are replaced by unity , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . to rewrite our equations in the cgs units",
    ", one needs to make the following substitutions : magnetic field @xmath7 , electric field @xmath8 , electric current @xmath9 , electrical resistivity @xmath10 , and the proton electric charge @xmath11 .",
    "we assume the plasma is non - relativistic , with both phase and physical velocities much smaller than the speed of light .",
    "we neglect electron inertia for the hall - mhd description of plasma .",
    "the generalized ohm s law is  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ion mass , @xmath14 is the plasma density , @xmath15 is the plasma velocity ( equal to the ion velocity ) , @xmath16 is the tensor of the electron pressure .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ohms_law ] ) are the single - fluid mhd terms , the third and fourth terms are the hall and electron pressure terms .",
    "the equation of plasma motion is  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the tensor of the total pressure ( equal to the sum of the electron and ion pressure tensors ) , and we neglect plasma viscosity .",
    "equation  ( [ motion_law ] ) appears exactly the same as in the case of single - fluid mhd .",
    "note that @xmath19 , and , for non - relativistic plasma , @xmath20 .",
    "we consider hall magnetic reconnection in the classical two - dimensional sweet - parker - petschek reconnection layer , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_layer ] .",
    "the layer is in the x - y plane with the x- and y - axes being perpendicular to and along the layer respectively .",
    "all @xmath21 derivatives are zero .",
    "the thickness of the reconnection layer is @xmath22 , which is defined as the thickness of the out - of - plane current ( @xmath23 ) profile across the layer .",
    "note that @xmath22 is approximately equal to the electron layer thickness , while the ion layer thickness @xmath24 can be much larger .",
    "velocity @xmath25 is the plasma inflow velocity in the upstream region at point  @xmath26 , outside the electron layer .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath27 at point  @xmath26 is in the y - direction .",
    "the out - of - plane field @xmath28 is assumed to have a quadrupole structure ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_layer ] ) , in agreement with numerical simulations and laboratory experiments of two - fluid reconnection  @xcite ( a nearly uniform `` guide '' field component of @xmath28 is taken to be zero ) .",
    "the reconnection layer is assumed to have a point symmetry with respect to its geometric center point  @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ figure_layer ] and reflection symmetries with respect to the axes @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the x- , y- and z - components of @xmath15 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 have the following simple symmetries : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in the derivations presented below",
    "we will extensively use these symmetries .",
    "now let us list four assumptions that we make in this study .",
    "first , we assume that the plasma flow is incompressible inside the reconnection layer , @xmath43 .",
    "second , we assume that the electrical resistivity @xmath44 is constant and very small , so that the lundquist number is very large .",
    "third , we assume that the reconnection process is slow and quasi - stationary , so that we can neglect all time - derivatives @xmath45 in eqs .",
    "( [ ohms_law])([motion_law ] ) and below .",
    "this assumption is satisfied if the reconnection rate is slow , @xmath46 , and there are no plasma instabilities in the reconnection layer .",
    "fourth , we assume that the electron and ion pressure tensors are isotropic , so that the pressure tensors in eqs .",
    "( [ ohms_law ] ) and  ( [ motion_law ] ) are scalars .    using ampere s law and neglecting the displacement current , we find the x- and y - components of the current to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 . here and",
    "below we use convenient notations @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and etc .",
    "the z - component of the current at the reconnection layer central point  @xmath29 is @xmath53 where we use estimates @xmath54 and @xmath55 at point  @xmath29 .",
    "next , neglecting the time derivative in eq .",
    "( [ motion_law ] ) , the equation for acceleration of plasma along the reconnection layer , in the y - direction , is @xmath56 .",
    "we calculate the first order partial derivative @xmath57 of this equation at point  o and obtain @xmath58 here , we used the fact that the pressure term is @xmath59 . thus , the drop of pressure @xmath18 along the layer is equal to the magnetic pressure drop of the parallel field component outside the layer .",
    "this result follows from the force balance condition for the plasma across the reconnection layer ( in analogy with the sweet - parker derivations for slowly inflowing plasma ) , and its rigorous proof can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the last expression in eq .",
    "( [ acceleration ] ) is obtained by defining the magnetic field external scale as @xmath60 this is the scale of magnetic field just outside the reconnection electron layer ( at point m ) and can be interpreted as the length of the layer .",
    "the @xmath61 derivative on the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ acceleration ] ) can be estimated from plasma incompressibility condition at the o - point , @xmath62 where we use an estimate @xmath63 .",
    "next , the faraday s law @xmath64 for the x- and y - components of a quasi - stationary magnetic field in two dimensions is @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the electric field z - component @xmath67 is constant in space , and from generalized ohm s law  ( [ ohms_law ] ) we obtain @xmath68 now , we use eq .",
    "( [ ohms_law_z ] ) to calculate @xmath67 at points  o and  m ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_layer ] ) . at point",
    "o we have @xmath69 . at point",
    "m we have @xmath70 , where we use an estimate @xmath71 .",
    "equating these two expressions for @xmath67 at points  o and  m and neglecting the resistive term outside the reconnection layer at point  m , @xmath72 , we obtain @xmath73 next , we calculate the second order partial derivative @xmath74 of eq .",
    "( [ ohms_law_z ] ) at point",
    "o. we have @xmath75 here , to obtain the final expression , we use the fact that the y - scale of the current @xmath23 , to a factor of order unity , is about the same as the y - scale of the outside magnetic field , @xmath76 .",
    "this result can be understood by taking the @xmath74 partial derivative of the ampere s law equation @xmath77 , see eq .",
    "( [ amperes_law ] ) , while keeping @xmath78 constant because the partial derivative in @xmath31 is to be taken at constant @xmath79 ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "next , we use the z - component of the faraday s law .",
    "we have @xmath80 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath81 partial derivative of this equation at point  o and use ohm s law  ( [ ohms_law ] ) for @xmath82 and @xmath83 . after tedious but straightforward derivations",

    "\\label{e_xy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , to derive the final expression , we use @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we also use formula @xmath90 . to prove it ,",
    "let us consider the z - component of plasma motion equation  ( [ motion_law ] ) , which is @xmath91 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath92 and @xmath74 derivatives of this equation at point  o and obtain @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath90 .    now , we have six equations  ( [ amperes_law ] ) ,  ( [ acceleration ] ) ,  ( [ v_derivative ] ) ,  ( [ e_z_perpendicular ] ) ,  ( [ e_z_parallel ] ) and  ( [ e_xy ] ) , and we have six unknowns : @xmath97 , @xmath78 , @xmath25 , @xmath61 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "thus , we can solve for all unknown quantities .",
    "for convenience of presentation , we express the solution in terms of the alfven velocity @xmath100 , the ion inertial length @xmath101 and the lundquist number @xmath102 .",
    "the solution is @xmath103 the last equation gives the reconnection rate @xmath67 . in the limit @xmath104 and @xmath105 the reconnection rate is slow , @xmath46 , and our assumption of a quasi - stationary reconnection process is self - consistent .",
    "equation  ( [ vy_y ] ) implies that the ions are accelerated up to approximately alfven velocity @xmath106 along the reconnection layer of length @xmath2 . at the same time , the rate of electron acceleration along the layer at point  o is @xmath107 , where @xmath108 denotes the electron velocity .",
    "the ion layer thickness @xmath24 can be estimated as follows . in the upstream region outside the ion layer at @xmath109 ideal single - fluid",
    "mhd applies .",
    "therefore , at @xmath109 and @xmath110 the resistive and hall terms in eq .",
    "( [ ohms_law_z ] ) can be neglected and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the plasma inflow velocity outside the ion layer .",
    "velocity @xmath113 is called the reconnection velocity .",
    "it can also be estimated as @xmath114 .",
    "thus , @xmath115    we discuss the solution  ( [ j_o])-([delta_ion ] ) in the next section .",
    "now , let us make an important remark .",
    "our analytical derivations involve an approximate solution of the hall - mhd equations in the infinitesimal neighborhood of line  om across the reconnection electron layer ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_layer ] ) .",
    "all physical quantities , @xmath97 , @xmath78 , @xmath25 , @xmath61 , @xmath98 , @xmath116 , @xmath27 and @xmath2 , are defined either at point  o ( the layer center ) or at point  m ( the upstream region ) . in other words , all our derivations involve only the upstream region and the layer center , and we do not need to consider the downstream region for estimation of the reconnection rate . this `` local '' equations approach was first developed in  @xcite for single - fluid mhd reconnection with anomalous electrical resistivity , and this approach works for hall - mhd reconnection as well .",
    "note however , that we define the field scale @xmath2 by eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) , and its exact value , as well as the value of field @xmath27 in the upstream region , depend on the `` global '' solution of the hall - mhd equations outside the reconnection layer . both @xmath2 and @xmath27 enter our model as parameters .",
    "determination of their values requires numerical simulations of the global field configuration and is not considered here .",
    "when @xmath117 ( @xmath118 is the sweet - parker layer thickness ) , the solution  ( [ j_o])-([delta_ion ] ) reduces to the sweet - parker solution : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    in the opposite limit ,",
    "when @xmath126 and reconnection is in a collisionless hall regime , we have @xmath127 the electron acceleration rate along the reconnection layer at o - point is @xmath128 .",
    "fast electron outflow along the layer creates the quadrupole field @xmath28  @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ ez_collisionless ] ) we find that the rate of collisionless hall reconnection , @xmath129 , is independent of the electrical resistivity @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "the reconnection velocity is @xmath130 . from eq .",
    "( [ delta_ion_collisionless ] ) we find @xmath131 for the ion layer thickness , which is in agreement with experiment  @xcite .    in it",
    "noteworthy that in the absence of collisions , when @xmath132 , it is an anisotropic electron pressure that balances @xmath67 field at point  o. in this case electrons are accelerated by @xmath67 field during time @xmath133 , while they are unmagnetized and are traveling with thermal speed @xmath134 inside the electron layer of length @xmath2 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the effective resistivity becomes @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the electron inertial length ( @xmath137 is the electron mass ) .",
    "thus , pressure anisotropy and electron inertia become important ( they will be considered elsewhere ) .    in the end of this paper , let us briefly discuss possible mechanisms of fast reconnection , which is independent of the macroscopic size of the reconnecting system .",
    "first , note that the collisionless hall reconnection rate @xmath129 is high when the reconnection electron layer length @xmath2 is microscopically small and comparable to @xmath0 .",
    "although the value of @xmath2 can not be determined in our model , numerical simulations find that @xmath2 can indeed be much smaller than the macroscopic system size  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath2 can be as small as @xmath138 during quasi - stationary collisionless reconnection , resulting in a very fast reconnection rate @xmath139  @xcite .",
    "another possible mechanism of fast reconnection can result from the dependence of the reconnection rate on the density @xmath14 and temperature @xmath140 of the plasma .",
    "we have @xmath141  @xcite , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , @xmath145 , and the collisionless hall reconnection rate is @xmath146 .",
    "thus , even if initially @xmath147 , as reconnection proceeds , the plasma is heated up by joule heating , the plasma temperature rises , the plasma density drops , and the reconnection becomes more and more collisionless and faster and faster .",
    "this run - away reconnection process can possibly operate in solar corona and earth s magnetosphere .",
    "the dependence @xmath146 also supports a model of self - regulation heating in solar corona  @xcite .",
    "i am especially grateful to russell kulsrud for many very helpful discussions and for pointing out to me the importance of electron pressure anisotropy .",
    "i would also like to thank ellen zweibel , fausto cattaneo , masaaki yamada , boon chye ( bc ) low , eugene parker , alex obabko , dmitri uzdensky , hantao ji , viacheslav titov , amitava bhattacharjee and the anonymous referee for their interest in this work , discussions and for useful comments .",
    "this work was supported by the nsf center for magnetic self - organization ( cmso ) in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas at the university of chicago .",
    "+ _ a note added after publication : _ after the publication of his paper , the author has became aware that simakov and chacon ( 2008 ) have independently obtained a hall reconnection rate formula , which is the same as eq .",
    "( 17 ) up to numerical factors of order unity  @xcite .",
    "although the final result is basically the same , the two derivations are significantly different .",
    "the author has used a rigorous local analysis , in which the hall - mhd equations are solved only in the upstream region and in the center of the reconnection layer . by contrast",
    ", simakov and chacon ( 2008 ) have used a different approach that also considers the downstream region . in particular",
    ", they have assumed that the thickness of the ion layer is given by @xmath148 , and obtained their reconnection rate formula as an approximate interpolation between the rates in the collisional and collisionless regimes .",
    "there are also minor differences in the problem formulation ; that of simakov and chacon ( 2008 ) includes electron viscosity , which is neglected by the author , and neglects electron pressure , which is included by the author .",
