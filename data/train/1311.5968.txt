    "many theories and theoretical schemes for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) predict the existence of massive charged and neutral vector particles in addition to the gauge bosons of the sm .",
    "such particles can arise either due to an extension of the sm gauge group @xcite , or as excitations of the sm gauge bosons ( see , for example @xcite ) ; the lowest excitations of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are usually called @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    the physical properties and the interactions of these particles are different in different models . in some models they can have couplings similar to those of the sm gauge bosons and can mediate the same processes with sm particles . in paper",
    "@xcite it was noted that in this case a nontrivial interference between the contributions of @xmath4 and @xmath0 to various processes could influence an experimental observation of the latter in the energy range close to its mass or the exclusion limits for it . in particular , the negative interference resulted in observed weaker exclusion limits in the case of the left - interacting compared to the right - interacting @xmath0 @xcite . the interference and its consequences were also discussed in papers @xcite .",
    "if the additional vector bosons are found at the lhc , there arises the problem of determining the theory beyond the sm , to which they correspond . to solve this problem one has to study the specific features of the additional vector bosons in different models . in the present paper",
    "we will do it for the excitations of the sm gauge bosons in models with universal extra dimensions ( ued ) , which have been widely discussed lately @xcite@xcite .",
    "in such brane - world models , not only the gravity , but also certain fields of the sm propagate either in the flat bulk @xcite , or in the randall - sundrum bulk @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is very natural to assume that only the sm gauge fields may propagate in the bulk since there is no consistent mechanism for trapping them on the brane @xcite .",
    "in contrast , such a mechanism exists for the fermion fields @xcite , and therefore the fermions may be trapped on a brane or localized in its neighborhood .    here",
    "we will consider a scenario , where only gauge fields live in the bulk of a stabilized brane - world model @xcite , i.e. , in the bulk between the branes with the separation distance stabilized by a scalar field and with a warped bulk metric different from that of the randall - sundrum model @xcite . unlike the ued models with the flat bulk @xcite , such models give rise to different wave functions for the fields of different tensor type and , for this reason , do not necessarily lead to the kk number conservation .",
    "therefore , a production of single kk states is possible in such a scenario .",
    "however , fcnc currents , which are strongly suppressed by the present - day experimental data , do not appear in this case since the neutral currents have the same diagonal structure as in the sm .",
    "in the case where only the sm gauge fields propagate in the randall - sundrum bulk , the masses of the kk excitations of the sm gauge bosons have to be approximately larger than @xmath8 in order not to contradict the ew precision data @xcite .",
    "such heavy states are obviously out of the reach of the @xmath7 lhc ( one might hope to detect the states at the @xmath9 lhc , if such a collider is realized ) . however , in the stabilized brane - world models , where the warp factor is different from the exponential of a linear function , as it is in the randall - sundrum model , the couplings of kk modes to the sm fields might be significantly different from those in the randall - sundrum model and , as a result , lighter kk excitations of the sm fields may be allowed .",
    "a study of such stabilized brane - world models has been carried out in papers @xcite , and it was found that they may also solve the hierarchy problem of the gravitational interaction , give rise to the masses of kk excitations in the @xmath10 energy range , but the corresponding equations can not be solved exactly and should be studied numerically .    in order to present better the physics of the processes mediated by the kk excitations of gauge bosons , here we will not carry out such calculations for a specific stabilized brane - world model , but rather give a qualitative description of the phenomena taking for the masses values close to the proposed benchmark snowmass 2013 parameter points @xcite , which have been chosen to cover the energy range of the lhc experiments at @xmath7 .",
    "such a choice of the kk masses seems to be very useful for comparing our results with experimental data at the @xmath7 lhc .",
    "though in our case , unlike in paper @xcite , the sm fermions are supposed to be localized on a brane and the coupling constants of the kk modes are assumed to be the same , as in the sm , it is not difficult to reproduce our results with different values of coupling constants .",
    "a study along these lines of collider processes mediated by the excitations of the sm electroweak gauge bosons propagating in the bulk of a stabilized brane - world model was performed in paper @xcite exposing the role of the interference . here",
    "we will briefly recall the results of this paper and elaborate them for a number of processes mediated by both charged and neutral gauge bosons and their kk excitations , taking into account also the contribution of the graviton resonances in the latter case .",
    "we consider both the processes with charged and neutral kk excitations , because all of them should manifest simultaneously in the lhc experiments .",
    "the processes mediated by the neutral particles including the graviton excitations have been discussed in @xcite within the framework of the unstabilized randall - sundrum model for the masses of the first kk excitations lying below @xmath11 , this energy range having been studied by the lhc nowadays @xcite .",
    "the presence of a destructive interference between @xmath12 and @xmath13 resonances in models with large extra dimensions was already noted in paper @xcite without taking into account the contributions of the higher excitations .",
    "here we extend the analysis of the processes with the intermediate neutral particles to a more general setting of stabilized randall - sundrum models and to a larger , not yet excluded , energy range taking into account contributions of the kk towers and all the interferences .",
    "the characteristic feature of theories with compact extra dimensions is the presence of towers of kaluza - klein excitations of the bulk fields , all the excitations of a bulk field having the same type of coupling to the fields of the sm .",
    "if we consider these theories for the energy or momentum transfer much smaller , than the masses of the kk - excitations , we can pass to the effective  low - energy \" theory , which can be obtained by the standard procedure .",
    "namely , we have to drop the momentum dependence in the propagators of the heavy modes and to integrate them out in the functional integral built with the original action . in the case , where only the gravity propagates in the bulk of a stabilized brane - world model , the resulting lagrangian turns out to be @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath15 stands for the energy - momentum tensor of the sm fields , @xmath16 is the mass of the first tensor resonance , @xmath17 is its ( inverse ) coupling constant to the sm fields , the constant @xmath18 takes into account the contribution of the scalar modes , the dimensionless constant @xmath19 is defined by the geometry of the model and can be computed numerically . in particular , in paper",
    "@xcite it was found to be equal approximately to @xmath20 in the stabilized randall - sundrum model . in this paper",
    "it was also noted that if the center of mass energy is close to the mass of the first resonance , its contribution should be taken into account exactly , whereas the rest of the tower can still be approximated by lagrangian ( [ tensor_intcrs ] ) with the effective coupling constant @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 .",
    "a contact interaction lagrangian can be obtained in the same way for the interactions mediated by the @xmath23 bulk gauge fields @xcite .",
    "these fields are described in the bulk by vector potentials @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which give rise to four - dimensional vector and scalar fields .",
    "the latter are in the trivial and in the adjoint representations of @xmath26 and can not break @xmath23 to @xmath27 , as it is necessary in the sm .",
    "for this reason , we assume that the gauge symmetry is broken in the standard way by the higgs field on the brane . it is useful to pass in the standard way to the charged vector fields @xmath28 and the physical neutral vector fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "after the spontaneous symmetry breaking the neutral component of the brane higgs field acquires the vacuum value @xmath31 , and there arises a quadratic interaction of the kk modes of the vector fields proportional to the product of the values of the wave functions of the modes on the brane and to @xmath32 for charged fields and to @xmath33 for neutral fields . due to this interaction the zero modes of the fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 acquire masses and the kk modes are no longer the mass eigenstates ; the latter are now superpositions of the modes @xcite .",
    "but if the mass scale generated by the higgs field is much smaller , than the mass of the first kk excitation  and it is exactly the scenario we are studying  this mixing of kk modes can be neglected @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the masses of the excitations of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons , as well as those of the photon , should be treated as nearly equal .",
    "this is due to the fact that all vector fields satisfy the same equation of motion in the bulk , and for this reason the kk masses of their excitations are the same , which is also true for more complicated models @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that a model - independent analysis based only on the properties of the sm gauge group representations carried by the fields of heavy charged and neutral bosons coupled to leptons also leads to a similar degeneracy of their masses @xcite .",
    "the interaction vertices of the kk modes and the fields of the sm are the same as those of the zero modes . integrating out the heavy modes , we again arrive at an effective lagrangian for the interaction of the sm fields due to the excitations of the @xmath34 gauge bosons @xmath35 @xmath36 being the energy scale of the model , @xmath37 denoting the @xmath26 gauge coupling constant and @xmath38 being the sm weak charged , weak neutral and electromagnetic currents .",
    "the constants @xmath39 are again model dependent and can be estimated only in a specific model .    in the case of the @xmath23 gauge fields in the 5-dimensional bulk",
    ", one can pass to the axial gauge , where the components corresponding to the extra dimension are equal to zero .",
    "thus , the gauge sector of the original 5-dimensional theory does not add scalar fields to the effective four - dimensional theory . in any brane - world model",
    ", the mass spectrum of gauge fields is defined by a sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem with neumann boundary conditions , the wave functions @xmath40 of the fields @xmath41 with definite masses being its solutions . due to this fact the wave function of the massless zero mode is constant in the extra dimension , which guarantees the universality of its coupling constant @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the randall - sundrum model @xcite , the masses of the lower excitations of vector fields are approximately given by the zeros of the bessel function @xmath42 @xcite ( @xmath43 being the energy scale of the model ) , whereas those of the tensor fields are approximately given by the corresponding zeros of the bessel function @xmath44 @xcite , which are always larger @xcite .",
    "thus , if the energy scale of the model is in the energy range , the masses of the modes appear to be also in the energy range .",
    "in fact , this is valid in stabilized brane - world models as well .",
    "we have already noted in the introduction that the phenomenological constraints on the masses of the gauge boson excitations in paper @xcite do not apply , in general , to stabilized models because the warp factor of a stabilized brane - world model differs from the exponential of a linear function in the unstabilized randall - sundrum model .",
    "we will be interested in the case where the masses of the modes and the mass gaps between them are quite large , say , of the order of a few .",
    "in particular , in the ued models with the energy scale @xmath45 , the mass of the lowest gauge boson excitations and that of the first graviton excitation are ( almost ) the same , whereas in the unstabilized randall - sundrum model they are @xmath46 for the lowest gauge boson excitations and @xmath47 for the lowest graviton excitation , their ratio being approximately equal to 1.6 and tending to 1 for the higher excitations .",
    "thus , we expect this ratio to be of the order of unity , and will use the value 1.5 in our subsequent calculations",
    ".    below we will consider some processes with the kaluza - klein electroweak gauge bosons at the energies accessible at the lhc supposing that the masses of @xmath48 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 are within this energy range .",
    "similar to the approach of paper @xcite we exactly take into account the contributions of the first kaluza - klein modes , whereas the contributions of all the other modes are taken into account by means of the effective contact interaction ( [ effl_v ] ) , from which the contribution of the first mode is subtracted .",
    "symbolic and numerical computations , including simulations of the sm background for the lhc , have been performed by means of the comphep package @xcite , into which the corresponding feynman rules for the new states and interactions have been implemented .",
    "first we consider the simpler case of the @xmath4 boson and its kk tower .",
    "the coupling constants of its excitations and their masses essentially depend on the fundamental parameters of a stabilized brane - world model , which is also true for the excitations of other particles to be discussed below . in particular , in paper @xcite the masses of the graviton excitations",
    "were explicitly calculated in terms of the fundamental parameters , which turned out to be a rather complicated task .    as we mentioned in the introduction , for our study",
    "we choose values for the excitations masses in the energy range of the lhc , but not yet excluded , and close to the snowmass 2013 benchmarks @xcite .",
    "we also note that for all the taken parameter points the width of an excitation is not larger that its mass as it should be .",
    "then the effective interaction lagrangian of the @xmath4 boson kk tower in the energy range close to the mass of the @xmath0 boson looks like @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the coupling constant of @xmath0 to the weak charged current @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the mass parameter taking into account the contribution of the kk tower above @xmath0 .",
    "thus , this lagrangian has three free parameters , including the @xmath0 mass .    under these assumptions we will study the processes @xmath53 and @xmath54 at the lhc .",
    "we start with the single top production .",
    "it occurs due to the weak process @xmath55 , which is mediated by the @xmath4 boson and its kk tower . in our approximation",

    "an interesting feature of all these plots is the absence of an interference between the first graviton kk excitation and that of the z boson ( the interference with the photon and its excitations is forbidden in qft ) .",
    "one can rigorously prove that there is no interference in the distributions in the invariant mass of the @xmath112-pair , because the interference terms vanish after the integration over the angles .",
    "explicit calculations show that the interference is also equal to zero for the distributions in the transverse momentum .",
    "at this point we have to make several remarks .",
    "first , as it was noted in @xcite , there is a good reason to believe that the interference picture discussed here is not destroyed by the nlo corrections .",
    "the pole structure of the amplitude , which leads to the non - trivial interference , is clearly not affected by the qcd corrections to the external lines and to the vertices .",
    "the most dangerous terms seem to be those of self - energy diagrams , but they are defined so as to vanish on the mass shell and therefore contribute only to the particle widths and to the renormalization of mass .",
    "second , the presence of just @xmath113 or @xmath114 or @xmath115 can produce similar effects .",
    "but if such effects are found , it is easy to improve our approach by taking into account the contributions of @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 exactly and approximating the contributions of the towers above them by contact interactions ( however , in order to handle such a situation the high luminosity and high energy regime of the lhc operation would be needed ) .",
    "as we have seen , the contribution to the amplitude of the tower above a mode is of the same order as the contribution of the mode proper away from the resonance .",
    "thus , on the basis of our analysis one can think that there should be distinct differences between the kk scenario and that with only two excitations of the sm electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "therefore , an observation of such interference effects for @xmath48 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 and the presence of the first tensor kk graviton can be interpreted as a strong argument in favor of the existence of extra dimensions .",
    "third , we would like to note once again that the masses of @xmath48 , @xmath13 , and @xmath12 resonances are nearly degenerate , and therefore one should observe resonances with practically the same masses in the single top and @xmath116 production processes and drell - yan processes , which is an interesting prediction of models with extra dimensions .    finally , we would also like to mention here that the scenario discussed in the present paper is very close to the framework of warped extra dimension with the standard model fields propagating in it @xcite , if one considers only the processes , to which the excitations of the sm fermions do not contribute .    thus , our analysis shows that in order to search correctly for the kaluza - klein excitations of sm particles , in particular , to put correctly exclusion limits , it is necessary , in modeling the signal , to sum the contributions to the amplitudes of all the kk modes above the resonances and to take into account their interference with the contribution of the resonances .",
    "our calculations of the single top and @xmath3 production and drell - yan processes also show that the lowest excitations of the sm gauge bosons , as well as that of the graviton , may be in principle observed at the lhc with the center of mass energy @xmath117 if their masses are below @xmath118 .",
    "however , realistic simulations taking into account the backgrounds are needed in order to find the lhc collider potential in searches for kk states including the interference with the rest of kk towers .",
