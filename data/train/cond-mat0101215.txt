    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in dilute alkali vapors @xcite has generated substantial theoretical and experimental research activity @xcite .",
    "bec provides an important quantum system where one can observe various phenomena such as superfluidity @xcite , vortices @xcite , spin domains @xcite or soliton - like behaviour @xcite .",
    "central to future advances with these quantum degenerate systems is their manipulation by external potentials .",
    "the use of light fields offers an exciting avenue in this respect as optical potentials can be state independent , offer an array of spatial forms and can be rapidly switched .",
    "they offer very good prospects for novel dipole traps and matter - wave guides .",
    "previous work has been reported for optical dipole traps based on standard gaussian light beams@xcite .",
    "free - space propagating light beams such as laguerre - gaussian light beams @xcite and bessel light beams @xcite are excellent candidates for advanced all - optical manipulation of quantum gases .",
    "laguerre - gaussian light beams offer a dark hollow central region for guiding and focusing atoms@xcite .",
    "their annular form can also be used to realise toroidal optical dipole traps for bec @xcite , enabling studies of persistent currents .",
    "bessel light beams are solutions of the scalar helmholtz equation that are propagation invariant .",
    "this immunity to diffraction coupled with the small size of their central region means they offer unique characteristics in the optical domain . in this work",
    "we discuss the use of bessel light beams for trapping and guiding cold atoms at or close to quantum degeneracy .",
    "specifically we study the bessel light beam optical dipole trap with the aim of generating one - dimensional quantum gases . in particular we look at the possible realisation of a tonks gas of impenetrable bosons which exhibit fermionic like excitations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we analyse in detail the waveguiding of a matter - wave beam along a higher - order bessel light beam",
    ". this method could provide an important route to realising all - optical atom interferometers and further the loading of magnetic waveguides .",
    "in this section we review the basics of the generation of bessel light beams .",
    "ideal forms of such beams are impossible to realise as they would have infinite extent and carry infinite power @xcite .",
    "however , finite approximations to these beams can be realised that propagate over extended distances in a diffraction free manner .",
    "holographic methods offer efficient generation of bessel beams @xcite .",
    "another very efficient method to generate an approximation to a bessel beam is by use of a conically shaped element termed an axicon and it is this form of bessel beam generation we concentrate upon in this work .",
    "this generation method is discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite but we review it here for completeness and clarity in notation .",
    "our main interest is using zeroth - order bessel beams for optical dipole traps and first - order bessel beams for atomic waveguiding , and we shall concentrate on these cases .",
    "bessel beams are solutions of the free - space wave equation which propagate with unchanging beam profile along the propagation axis which we take as @xmath0 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath1 . the electric field of a monochromatic , linearly polarized ideal bessel beam of order @xmath2 and frequency @xmath3 is @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a scale electric field value , @xmath6 is the @xmath2th order bessel function",
    ", @xmath7 is the azimuthal mode number which we take as positive for simplicity in notation , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the radial and longitudinal wavevectors such that @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the zeroth - order solution @xmath12 has a central maximum surrounded by concentric rings of roughly equal power while the higher - order solutions @xmath6 have zero on - axis intensity also with concentric rings .",
    "the method of generating a bessel beam by use of an axicon is based on the observation that the fourier transform of the bessel beam solution ( [ jell ] ) over the transverse plane @xmath13 is an infinitely high ring in the spatial frequency domain peaked at @xmath14 , where the phase varies from zero to @xmath15 around the peak : the bessel beams may therefore be viewed as a superposition of plane - waves with transverse wavevectors lying on a ring of magnitude @xmath8 .",
    "a finite realization of such a beam may be produced by passing a laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beam of order @xmath2 through an axicon as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.one ] .",
    "the axicon is a conically shaped optical element which imparts a phase shift @xmath16 to an incident field where @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the refractive index of the axicon material , and @xmath19 the internal angle of the element . by choosing @xmath20 for a specific bessel beam the axicon imposes the ring of transverse wavevectors characteristic of the bessel beams on the incident beam , and these plane - waves come together past the axicon to produce a bessel beam .",
    "single - ringed lg beams ( i.e. with radial mode index @xmath21 ) , which may be produced using holographic elements , have electric field envelopes ( plane - wave factor @xmath22 removed ) at focus of the form @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the power at @xmath25 incident on the axicon , @xmath26 is the gaussian spot size , and @xmath2 is the azimuthal mode number",
    ". then a lg mode of order @xmath2 incident on a axicon with @xmath20 has the appropriate azimuthal phase variation to produce a @xmath2th order bessel beam past the axicon . in particular , from geometrical considerations and for an lg mode of size @xmath26",
    ", we expect the ring of plane - waves imposed by the axicon to overlap spatially over a longitudinal range @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "this gives the estimate @xcite @xmath29 for the range over which the plane - waves overlap and produce a finite realization of the bessel beam profile @xmath30 past the axicon : the larger the input spot size @xmath26 the larger the center portion of the transverse plane over which the actual field approaches the ideal bessel beam .    numerical simulations and accompanying experiments have verified this physical picture for bessel beam generation using an axicon @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations used the fresnel diffraction integral to propagate the input lg field ( eq . ( [ lg ] ) ) times the phase aberration @xmath31 due to the axicon , to distances beyond the axicon .",
    "figure [ fig.two ] shows a gray - scale plot of the field intensity @xmath32 as an example of this numerical propagation for @xmath33 mm , @xmath34 nm , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , giving @xmath37 m@xmath38 .",
    "for this example @xmath39 cm and the simulation shows that this indeed estimates the scale of the bessel beam propagation . as expected for a @xmath40 beam the intensity profile has a dark fringe at the center of width of about @xmath41 .",
    "the evolution of the field past the axicon may also be approximated using the method of stationary phase applied to the fresnel integral @xcite , which yields the following expression for the field intensity @xmath42 for an @xmath2th order lg input mode @xmath43 with @xmath44 given by eq .",
    "( [ zmax ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig.three ] shows the on - axis intensity @xmath45 versus propagation distance @xmath0 past the axicon obtained using both the fresnel integral approach ( solid line ) and the approximate solution ( [ bessapp ] ) ( dashed line ) for the same parameters as fig . [ fig.two ] except @xmath46 , with excellent agreement ( for @xmath46 the intensity has a peak on - axis ) .",
    "in particular , by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ bessapp ] ) we find that the peak intensity evaluated over the whole transverse plane occurs at @xmath47 which gives @xmath48 cm , in excellent agreement with the results in fig .",
    "[ fig.three ] . the approximate expression ( [ bessapp ] ) is applicable over the center region of the bessel beam if @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "( [ zmax ] ) this condition can be written as @xmath50 : recognizing that @xmath51 is twice the rayleigh range @xmath52 of the input lg beam @xcite , and @xmath53 is a measure of the width of the central lobe of the @xmath12 bessel beam or the central dark fringe for a @xmath40 beam , we see that if @xmath54 then eq . ( [ bessapp ] )",
    "should be valid over most of the propagation range of the bessel beam around the position of the peak @xmath55 .",
    "that is , under conditions where the central spot or dark fringe of the bessel beam is narrow compared to the input lg spot size , which is what we want , the stationary phase approximation should be valid . for the above examples @xmath56 , and",
    "this is typical of parameters we consider .",
    "we shall assume this condition is satisfied hereafter and use the approximate expression ( [ bessapp ] ) in the remainder of this paper .    finally , we point out one further feature of bessel beams that highlights their utility , namely , that their radial width @xmath57 is determined solely by the laser wavelength and the axicon parameters , whereas their longitudinal extent @xmath58 is also dependent on the incident lg spot size @xmath26 .",
    "this means that the longitudinal extent and radial confinement can be varied independently .",
    "this is in contrast to a gaussian beam of equal spot @xmath26 for which the longitudinal extent of the focus is the rayleigh range @xmath59 .",
    "in this section we examine the use of zeroth - order or @xmath12 bessel beams for creating elongated optical dipole traps for becs , and assess their utility for realizing one - dimensional trapped gases and a tonks gas @xcite of impenetrable bosons @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on the case of bosonic atoms but similar considerations apply to degenerate fermionic atoms @xcite in bessel beam traps .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) describing the macroscopic wave function @xmath60 of an @xmath61-atom bec in an optical dipole trap can be written as @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is laplacian which is the sum of the radial and longitudinal laplacians , @xmath64 is the atomic mass , @xmath65 is the effective three - dimensional short - range interaction strength , with @xmath66 being the s - wave scattering length .",
    "the potential term on the right - hand - side @xmath67 describes the optical dipole potential with @xmath68 the laser detuning from the optical transition frequency @xmath69 , @xmath70 the natural linewidth of the optical transition , @xmath71 is the resonant saturation intensity , and @xmath72 . for a red - detuned laser",
    "the potential is negative and the atoms are attracted to the regions of high intensity , whereas for a blue - detuned laser the atoms are repelled into the low field regions .      here",
    "we investigate the properties of an optical dipole trap formed using a red - detuned @xmath12 beam , so that the atoms are attracted to the intense central maximum of the intensity distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ bessapp ] ) with @xmath46 @xmath73 we are primarily interested in tight bound optical dipole traps so we shall approximate the optical dipole potential ( [ optpot ] ) using the parabolic approximation to the full intensity @xmath74 around the intensity maximum at @xmath75 : @xmath76 with @xmath77 a red - detuned ( @xmath78 ) @xmath12 optical dipole potential therefore provides confinement in both the radial and longitudinal directions . here",
    "@xmath79 is the radial oscillation frequency with corresponding ground state oscillator width @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is the ratio between the longitudinal and radial trap frequencies @xmath82 @xcite , which also determines the aspect ratio between the radial and longitudinal ground state widths @xmath83 ( in the absence of many - body repulsion ) .",
    "we remark that even for tight transverse confinement anharmonic corrections beyond the parabolic approximation for the longitudinal ( @xmath0 ) variation of the optical dipole potential ( [ dippot ] ) are generally required .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig.three ] where the on - axis intensity variation for the @xmath12 bessel beam is not symmetric around the peak . for this work",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the parabolic approximation .",
    "we remark , however , that anharmonic corrections to the parabolic approximation can have pronounced effects on the trap properties such as the condensate fraction and the frequencies of the collective excitations that can be supported by bessel atomic waveguides , especially for shallow traps @xcite .",
    "so far we have ignored the effects of gravity which we assume acts in the radial direction so the longitudinal axis of the trap is horizontal . for",
    "tight radial confinement gravity will serve simply to displace the origin of the radial motion , and this applies under conditions such that @xmath84 with @xmath85 ms@xmath38 . using @xmath80 , this lead to the condition on the confinement of the ground state , @xmath86{\\hbar^2/(2 m^2 g)}$ ] .",
    "for example , for @xmath87rb the radial confinement has to be less than @xmath88 , whereas for @xmath89na a confinement @xmath90 would be sufficient .",
    "we assume that this condition is satisfied and hereafter neglect the effects of gravity .      from eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) the parameter @xmath81 is seen to determine the anisotropy of the @xmath12 optical dipole trap .",
    "it is well known that in the limit @xmath91 highly asymmetric cigar - shaped traps are formed which are elongated along the longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "bessel beams are exceptional in this regard as they can produce extreme asymmetries . to illustrate this recall that @xmath26 is the input lg spot size _ before _ the axicon , for example @xmath92 , so that @xmath93 for a @xmath94 .",
    "we stress that one obtains such large asymmetries using bessel beams without sacrificing the radial confinement , as the radial ( @xmath53 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath44 ) extents of the bessel beam are independently variable .",
    "in contrast , for a gaussian optical dipole trap changing the focused spot size @xmath26 also changes the longitudinal extension of the dipole trap set by the rayleigh range @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath91 corresponds to the regime of one - dimensional trapped gases @xcite in which the radial variation of the macroscopic wave function is effectively frozen as the normalized ground state mode @xmath95 of the radial optical dipole potential @xmath96 writing the macroscopic wave function in a form reflecting the single - radial mode nature of the solution @xmath97 and combining eqs .",
    "( [ gpeq1 ] ) , ( [ dippot ] ) , ( [ gpeq2 ] ) , and ( [ ground ] ) we obtain the one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation for the reduced system @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the effective one - dimensional short - range interaction strength @xcite . in steady - state we set @xmath100 in eq .",

    "the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gpeq1d ] ) has previously been investigated as a model for a one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate in a number of situations , including the ground state @xcite and dynamics @xcite of cigar shaped traps @xcite , dark solitons @xcite , bright solitons for negative scattering lengths @xcite , gap solitons in optical lattices @xcite , atom waveguides @xcite , and as a model luttinger liquid @xcite . here",
    "our goal is to highlight the utility of @xmath12 optical dipole traps for experimental studies of one - dimensional trapped gases . to illustrate the basic scales involved in these elongated traps we consider the case of the @xmath106 transition of rb with @xmath107w / m@xmath108 and @xmath109 . a far red - detuned laser at a wavelength of @xmath110",
    "is used to generate a bessel beam with a longitudinal extent @xmath111 and a central spot of full - width radius @xmath112 ( corresponding to @xmath113 and consequently @xmath114 ) . if a laser power of @xmath115w is used this results in a trap potential of about @xmath116k depth with radial trap frequency @xmath117 , radial confinement of @xmath118 , and an aspect ratio of @xmath119 . then for @xmath120 atoms and a scattering length @xmath121 , for example , we find @xmath122 , and a peak density @xmath123 cm@xmath38 . for comparison ,",
    "a focused gaussian with the same radial confinement ( and trap depth ) gives a trap with an aspect ratio of only @xmath125 .",
    "we remark , however , that the power required to obtain the same radial confinement for the gaussian beam is much less , typically on the order of milliwatts @xcite .",
    "this arises because for the bessel beam the trapped atoms only experience the intensity in the central peak of the beam , and the concentric rings surrounding the peak , though key in realizing the long extent of the bessel optical dipole trap , do not directly affect the atomic confinement .",
    "bessel beam traps will suffer from the same loss mechanisms as other shallow far - off resonance dipole traps .",
    "apart from heating due to diffractive collisions with background gas @xcite , the trap lifetime will be limited by laser - noise - induced heating @xcite .",
    "the expected loss rates due to intensity fluctuations and pointing instability of the laser beam for a bessel beam trap should be comparable to those in gaussian beam traps with identical radial confinement and trap depth . finally , we note that the @xmath12 optical dipole trap provides a means to accelerate an atomic trapped one - dimensional gas .",
    "consider a one - dimensional gas in the ground state of the @xmath12 trap peaked around @xmath126 .",
    "if we now start to slowly increase the lg spot size @xmath127 , then the longitudinal position of the peak density of the trapped gas should vary in time according to @xmath128 .",
    "such a scheme provides a means to impart a longitudinal velocity to an initially stationary trapped gas .      in the above discussion we tacitly assumed that the system of cold atoms formed a bec",
    "however , petrov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have theoretically studied the diagram of state for a one - dimensional gas of trapped bosons , assuming @xmath129 , and found that a true bec , or at least a quasi - condensate , with concomitant macroscopic occupation of a single state , is only attained for high enough particle numbers @xmath130 with @xmath131 for @xmath132 and temperatures @xmath133 , one obtains a tonks gas of impenetrable bosons for which hard core repulsion between the bosonic atoms prevents them from penetrating through each other in the one - dimensional system , and the system acquires properties reminiscent of a one - dimensional system of fermionic atoms .",
    "this remarkable property of the tonks gas is related to the breakdown of the spin - statistics theorem in one - dimension , and is reflected in the fermi - bose mapping for this system first elucidated by girardeau @xcite , and applied to atomic waveguides by olshanii @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical investigations of tonks gases have shown that they can support dark soliton structures @xcite , and also that their coherence properties are significantly different from the corresponding bec @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent experimental developments suggest that tonks gases should be realizable in magnetic atom waveguides @xcite , and bongs _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed a hybrid trap composed of optical dipole trap formed with a first - order lg beam combined with magnetic longitudinal trapping . here",
    "we examine the utilty of @xmath12 optical dipole traps for realizing a tonks gas .    the highly elongated bessel beam discussed in the previous section ( @xmath110 , @xmath134w , @xmath135 , @xmath136 )",
    "would be an ideal candidate for the experimental realization of a tonks gas .",
    "the low aspect ratio @xmath119 and tight radial confinement @xmath137 result in a high upper boundary @xmath138 for the particle number of the tonks gas . for the commonly used @xmath139rb isotope with a scattering length @xmath140 nm",
    "one finds @xmath141 .",
    "although this is still a fairly low value it should be possible to experimentally realize a small @xmath139rb tonks gas .",
    "however , more promising would be the use of the @xmath87rb isotope , where a feshbach resonance can be used to tune the normally negative scattering length to positive values of several hundred nanometers magnitude @xcite . as @xmath138 is proportional to the square of the scattering length",
    "even a moderate increase to @xmath142 would make it possible to create a larger tonks gas , with say @xmath143 atoms , which should be easily detectable .",
    "the bessel beam trap offers some advantages compared to alternative suggested approaches using magnetic waveguides @xcite and a hybrid magnetic - optical trap @xcite .",
    "firstly , it involves only a very simple _ all - optical _ system for which the aspect ratio of the trap may be controlled simply by varying the gaussian spot size incident on the axicon .",
    "more specifically , being an all - optical , it does not involve material surfaces as in magnetic waveguides , which can cause matter - wave decoherence @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it allows for the possibility of trapping multiple magnetic sublevels and the investigation of multi - component tonks gases , which would not be possible in the hyrbrid magnetic - optical trap of bongs _ et al .",
    "the higher - order bessel beams @xmath144 with @xmath7 have zero on - axis intensity surrounded by intense concentric rings , and a blue - detuned beam can trap therefore atoms radially in the dark hollow core of the beam .",
    "in addition , since the intensity vanishes on - axis the higher - order beams produce negligible longitudinal confinement ( see fig . [ fig.two ] for the @xmath40 bessel beam ) in comparison to the @xmath12 bessel beam .",
    "the higher - order bessel beams therefore present the opportunity to realize atomic waveguides with tight radial confinement over distances comparable with the propagation range @xmath44 of the bessel beams .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath40 beam is special in that it provides a parabolic radial trapping potential to lowest order ( see below ) , whereas the higher - order trapping potential vary as @xmath145 near the axis .",
    "we shall therefore concentrate on the @xmath40 atomic waveguide .      here",
    "we investigate the properties of an atomic waveguide formed using a blue - detuned ( @xmath146 ) @xmath40 beam , so that the atoms are repelled into the zero intensity central minimum of the intensity distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ bessapp ] ) with @xmath147 @xmath148 substituting this expression in the optical dipole potential ( [ optpot ] ) we write the atomic waveguiding potential in the form @xmath149 where in the last form of the potential we used the approximation @xmath150 which is applicable for tight radial confinement . here the @xmath0-dependent radial oscillation frequency @xmath151 is given by @xmath152 with @xmath153 the position of the peak intensity for the @xmath40 bessel beam , and @xmath154 is the peak radial oscillation frequency given by @xmath155 in comparison to the radial oscillation frequency of the @xmath12 bessel beam trap we find @xmath156 .",
