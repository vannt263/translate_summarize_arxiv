    "angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments are valuable sources of information about the shape of the fermi surface in the cuprates , and the frequency , momentum and temperature dependence of the electron self - energy .",
    "the subject of this paper is an analysis of the dispersion along various momentum cuts .",
    "these dispersions have been obtained by several groups @xcite by high precision measurements of the momentum distribution curves ( mdcs ) , by which the spectral function is obtained at a given energy by making scans along directions normal to the fermi surface .",
    "the spectral function @xmath2 is related to the self - energy @xmath3 as @xmath4 near the fermi surface , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bare value of the velocity .",
    "there are several reasons ( both theoretical and experimental ) to believe that the self - energy weakly depends on the value of @xmath7 normal to the fermi surface , and can be approximated as @xmath8 . for a given @xmath9 specified by a cut , the mdc spectral function @xmath10 is then a lorentzian centered at @xmath11 with a hwhm equal to @xmath12 ( ref .  ) . in a generic fermi liquid ,",
    "the self - energy is linear in @xmath13 at the lowest energies : @xmath14 .",
    "the position of the mdc peak then determines the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath15 . at higher energies ,",
    "@xmath16 becomes frequency dependent , and the dispersion deviates from the linear form .",
    "the mdc data have revealed several characteristic features of the dispersion which need to be explained :    * in the normal state , the dispersion along both the nodal and antinodal directions shows a relatively smooth crossover from a linear behavior at small binding energies to a more steep behavior above roughly @xmath17 .",
    "this effect has been observed in @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , and @xmath22 @xcite . in the last case ,",
    "the crossover is sharper and more resembles a kink . *",
    "the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath23 along the nodal direction weakly depends on doping @xcite and in @xmath18 equals @xmath24 @xcite . at the same time , at high energies , the dispersion is strongly doping dependent , becoming steeper with underdoping @xcite . * in the superconducting state , the dispersion along the antinodal direction develops an @xmath1shape @xcite , with a `` negative '' dispersion between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this feature develops with decreasing temperature in an order parameter like fashion , with an onset temperature at @xmath27 for overdoped samples , and somewhat above @xmath27 for underdoped samples",
    "* the dispersion along the nodal direction does not develop an @xmath1shape below @xmath27 .",
    "instead , in the superconducting state the crossover gets sharper , with a kink - like feature near @xmath28 developing in @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this extra  sharpness \" has a temperature dependence similar to that of the antinodal dispersion mentioned above @xcite . in @xmath19 and @xmath22 ,",
    "on the other hand , the nodal dispersion does not change much between the normal and superconducting states @xcite . *",
    "the high energy nodal dispersion never recovers to the bare dispersion .",
    "it remains linear to the highest binding energy studied @xcite , with an interpolation to a @xmath29 point at zero energy displaced well inside the fermi surface .",
    "theoretical scenarios proposed to explain the data differ primarily on whether the electron - electron or the electron - phonon interaction is responsible for the observed behavior . in the electron - electron scenario , the crossover from a linear dispersion at the lowest energies to a more steep dispersion at higher energies has been identified @xcite with the crossover from fermi liquid to non - fermi liquid behavior . in the superconducting state ,",
    "the @xmath1shape dispersion along the antinodal direction has been associated @xcite with the interaction with the @xmath0 spin exciton , which below @xmath27 emerges at a frequency @xmath30 due to a feedback of the pairing on the spin susceptibility .",
    "the interaction with the exciton gives rise to a @xmath31 which strongly increases and then rapidly drops as @xmath13 approaches @xmath32 .",
    "this gives rise to the observed @xmath1shape dispersion .",
    "in optimally doped @xmath18 , both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are close to @xmath35 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath1shape piece is stronger for @xmath37 , since for @xmath38 , @xmath39 rapidly increases .",
    "both the value of @xmath40 and the asymmetry of the @xmath1shape dispersion agree with the data @xcite .    for nodal fermions , scattering by @xmath41 shifts the nodal fermi point to an energy about @xmath42 above @xmath43 .",
    "this energy is too high to expect any appreciable effect on the low energy dispersion .",
    "still , eschrig and norman @xcite argued that the kink near @xmath28 can be explained by the interaction with the spin resonance , as the resonance has a finite momentum width around @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "they used a phenomenological form of the spin susceptibility with a sharp @xmath44 function in frequency at @xmath34 and a lorentzian in momentum space with a width of 2 lattice constants , with the momentum smearing giving rise to resonance scattering between the node and other fermi surface points . but",
    "a good description of the nodal fermion spectrum required the inclusion of a gapped continuum in the spin excitation spectrum , which acts to smear the @xmath1shape into a kink , and also gives rise to the linear @xmath13 behavior in @xmath45 observed at higher binding energies .",
    "the electron - phonon scenario for the dispersion was put forward in ref .  .",
    "the key difference with the electron - electron scenario is in the interpretation of the normal state arpes data  ref",
    ".   argued that there is a sharp kink ( rather than a crossover ) in the dispersion in the normal state , and that the kink energy is about the same in all materials studied ( @xmath22 , @xmath19 , and @xmath18 ) .",
    "they further argued that the kink effect is rather isotropic in the brillouin zone ( in disagreement with other work @xcite ) .",
    "they speculated that this similarity implies that superconductivity plays a secondary role in the phenomenon , and that the features in the dispersion can be reproduced by coupling an electron to a bosonic mode unrelated to superconductivity .",
    "they suggested a @xmath46 optical phonon with an energy of @xmath47 @xcite as the best candidate .    in this paper ,",
    "we distinguish between these two possibilities and argue in favor of a spin - fluctuation scenario .",
    "we first analyze the spin - fluctuation scenario in more detail .",
    "we argue that the spin resonance scattering is effective in scattering antinodal fermions near the fermi energy , but is not effective for nodal fermions since the bosonic momenta which connect a nodal point with other points on the fermi surface are far removed from @xmath0 .",
    "rather , the most effective low - energy scattering for a nodal fermion is to the antinode , where the density of states has a singularity .",
    "this scattering gives rise to a kink in the self - energy of a nodal fermion at @xmath48 which generates a kink in the dispersion at the same energy .",
    "we find that the resonance scattering emerges away from the nodal direction , and the magnitude of the resulting @xmath1shape dispersion progressively increases as the antinode is approached @xcite .",
    "we then argue that the interaction with an einstein phonon gives rise to a temperature independent @xmath1shape dispersion for all cuts normal to the fermi surface .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with both the antinodal dispersion , for which the @xmath1shape is present but only emerges below @xmath27 , and the nodal dispersion which does not display an @xmath1shape form at any temperature .",
    "in the magnetic scenario , the fermionic self - energy originates from the strong spin component of the electron - electron interaction in the particle - hole channel and can be viewed as coming from scattering by collective spin fluctuations .",
    "to lowest order , the corresponding self - energy is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the spin - fermion coupling . here",
    "@xmath51 is the bare green s function ( in the normal state , @xmath52 ) , and @xmath53 is the dynamical spin susceptibility for which one has , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the static part of the susceptibility which is believed to be peaked at or near the antiferromagnetic momentum @xmath41 , and @xmath56 ( subject to @xmath57 ) accounts for the spin dynamics and is proportional to the dynamical part of the full particle - hole bubble . for a non - diagonal @xmath58 that connects points on the fermi surface",

    "this is the expected result as once @xmath58 is such that two @xmath68points separated by @xmath58 can be simultaneously put on the fermi surface , the polarization bubble contains a landau damping term .",
    "this term generally has the form @xmath69 but in our case @xmath70 is finite and @xmath71 well exceeds @xmath72 .",
    "the true polarization bubble also contains a frequency independent piece , but this piece comes from fermions with energies comparable to the bandwidth and is already incorporated into @xmath73 . note that this separation is consistent with a kramers - kronig ( kk ) analysis : a kk transformation of @xmath74 does not produce a universal piece of @xmath75 independent of the upper limit of the frequency integration .      substituting the relaxational @xmath76 into the self - energy , introducing a small @xmath58 via @xmath77 and linearizing the fermionic dispersion near the fermi surface",
    ", we obtain from ( [ s1 ] )    @xmath78    where @xmath79 stands for normal state .",
    "for consistency with the assumption that the self - energy weakly depends on @xmath80 , we assume that the fermionic propagator changes much faster with @xmath81 than the bosonic @xmath82 , i.e. , that the fermi velocity is much larger than the `` spin '' velocity .",
    "we then integrate over momentum @xmath81 normal to the fermi surface only in the fermionic propagator , and set @xmath81 in the bosonic propagator equal to its value at a distance between @xmath9 and some other point on the fermi surface which is parametrized by @xmath83 .",
    "the integration over @xmath84 is straightforward , and performing it using the fact that @xmath76 is an even function of frequency , we obtain @xmath85 the remaining integral over @xmath83 depends on the momentum dispersions in @xmath55 and @xmath86 along the fermi surface , both are inputs for the low - energy theory . for a qualitative understanding of the crossover in the dispersion , we assume momentarily that @xmath87 is flat near @xmath88 , and that @xmath89 and @xmath90 are also momentum independent .",

    "the crossover frequency @xmath120 is smallest for an antinodal fermion and largest for a nodal fermion simply because the node - node distance is smaller than @xmath41 , and hence for node - node scattering @xmath121 . for an antinodal fermion ,",
    "on the other hand , the antinode - antinode scattering involves momenta very close to @xmath88 , hence @xmath122 is smaller as the piece @xmath123 is absent .",

    "for the spin - fermion interaction , this crossing always occurs at negative @xmath125 for the nodal direction . ]",
    "we now perform the same analysis for phonon scattering . consider a system of electrons interacting with an optical phonon with a frequency @xmath356 and momentum @xmath357 .",
    "the optical phonon propagator can be reasonably approximated by @xmath358 where @xmath359 rapidly decays at deviations from @xmath360 , and @xmath115 is the phonon damping rate .",

    "the real part of the self - energy for small @xmath115 nearly diverges as @xmath13 approaches @xmath369 , giving rise to an @xmath258-shape dispersion .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "the @xmath258-shape could in principle be eliminated if @xmath115 is very large , i.e , the bosonic mode is almost overdamped .",
    "however , one can easily make sure that to avoid the @xmath1shape , one requires @xmath370 this can be relatively easily achieved at weak coupling , but for @xmath371 , which is required to fit the low energy renormalizaton , the @xmath1shape is eliminated only at nonphysical @xmath372 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath373 , the @xmath1shape can not be eliminated for any @xmath115 . if we do not neglect the fermi velocity at @xmath363 , then at the lowest frequencies we obtain qualitatively the same result as ( [ s4 ] ) , i.e , a nearly one - sided square - root singularity .",
    "again , it is very difficult to get rid of the @xmath1shape form of the dispersion at strong coupling without requiring that the bosonic mode is totally overdamped .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that the interaction with an optical phonon can simultaneously account for a strong fermi velocity renormalization and give rise to a non @xmath1shape form of the dispersion .",
    "we conclude therefore that the spin fluctuation scenario more likely explains the observed features in the electron dispersion than the phonon scenario . within the spin fluctuation scenario : ( i ) in the normal state",

    "qualitatively , our picture of an @xmath1shape dispersion in the antinodal region below @xmath27 , and a kink dispersion in the nodal region which is similar above and below @xmath27 , agrees well with the data .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath375 and @xmath376 relevant for the antinodal and nodal dispersion , respectively , were estimated to be @xmath377 and @xmath378 in @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this scale has been detected for the nodal dispersion and is around @xmath379 .",
    "the resonance frequency @xmath34 and the gap @xmath33 in optimally doped @xmath18 are both near @xmath35 @xcite , hence the termination of the @xmath1shape in the antinodal dispersion and the kink in the nodal dispersion both occur near @xmath26 .",
    "experimentally , this scale is @xmath26 along the antinodal direction and @xmath17 along the nodal direction @xcite .",
    "both of these gap - related scales are smaller in lsco , but for that material , there are no noticeable differences between the normal and superconducting state dispersions .",
    "this implies that the effect of the superconductivity on the dispersion is very small ( though it should be noted that most of the  normal state \" data for lsco were actually taken in the pseudogap state ) .",
    "we note in passing that the same smallness was cited as a reason for the non - observation of the resonance peak in lsco @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the doping dependence of the dispersion .",
    "there are few systematic studies of the doping dependence along the antinodal direction @xcite .",
    "our study shows that the magnitude of the @xmath1shape dispersion should increase with underdoping as @xmath380 increases , and the coupling constant gets larger . along the nodal direction",
    ", the low energy fermi velocity @xmath381 is relatively doping independent @xcite . in constrast ,",
    "the slope of the high energy dispersion monotonically increases with underdoping @xcite . within our theory ,",
    "the low energy fermi velocity is given by @xmath382 , and the coupling constant @xmath383 depends on the spin - fermion coupling @xmath50 and @xmath384 .",
    "the coupling constant is weakly doping dependent .",
    "the susceptibility does depend on doping via the magnetic correlation length @xmath385 , but this dependence is non - singular for the node - antinode @xmath386 .",
    "once @xmath387 , the doping dependence disappears , and the nodal coupling @xmath383 saturates at a fixed value .",
    "previous studies by both us and others yielded @xmath388 .",
    "this yields a bare velocity @xmath389 consistent with band theory .",
    "we believe that the increase of the high energy slope with underdoping is a separate effect associated with the fact that at high energies , the system progressively develops sdw precursors .",
    "indeed , at high energies , the diagonal scattering by the resonance mode at @xmath88 can not be neglected .",
    "the argument is simple  at high energies , the green s function of an intermediate fermion can be pulled out from the momentum and frequency integral in eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) , and the fermionic self - energy acquires the same functional form as in the sdw ordered state : @xmath390 where @xmath391 increases with underdoping .",
    "this form is valid for @xmath392 . substituting this self - energy into the dispersion relation , we find after simple algebra that for the negative energies probed in arpes measurements , the maximum of the mdc dispersion shifts from @xmath393 to @xmath394 . as @xmath395 and @xmath396 , the correction to",
    "the velocity is positive , i.e. , the diagonal scattering enhances the value of the velocity compared to @xmath397 .",
    "as @xmath398 increases , this effect gives rise to a progressively steeper dispersion , in agreement with the data .    a simple way to appreciate the doping dependence of the high energy dispersion is to realize that the mdc dispersion for a gapped state is almost vertical for @xmath399 , with some weak dispersion due to coherence factors @xcite .",
