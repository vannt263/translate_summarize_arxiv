    "two particle azimuth correlation is a useful tool to study the strongly interacting partonic matter believed to has been created at rhic au+au collisions .",
    "the typical correlation function can be decomposed into a jet part @xmath1 and an underlying event part @xmath2 that is modulated by the elliptic flow  @xcite : @xmath3 in the case that dijet is not modified by the medium , @xmath1 behaves just like in p+p collisions .",
    "the rhic data has shown a rich modification pattern , which is dependent on the @xmath4 of both particles and can be characterized into four qualitatively distinct regions .",
    "1 ) a broadening jet shape at the away side and enhancement of the jet multiplicity at both the near and away side at low @xmath4  @xcite ; 2 ) a flat or possible volcano - shaped away side jet pairs at intermediate @xmath4  @xcite ; 3 ) a seemly complete disappearance of away side jet or equivalently a flat away side extended to the near side at moderately high @xmath4  @xcite;4 ) reappearance of the away side jet peak at very high @xmath4@xcite .",
    "several models were proposed to explain various aspects of the modification pattern , but so far no model can consistently describe all four regions on a quantitative level .    the medium effects on the dijets can be quantified by @xmath5 , which is the ratio of the jet yield per trigger in a+a collisions to that in p+p collisions . since the modification is always on the jet pairs , the following relation holds between the per - trigger yield using the high @xmath4 particles as triggers ( type a ) and that using low @xmath4 particles as triggers ( type b ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the single particle suppression factor , jetpairs@xmath8 and jetpairs@xmath9 represent the average number of jet pairs in one a+a collision and one p+p collision , respectively .",
    "one would expect @xmath10 for hadron - hadron correlation due to trigger surface bias .",
    "in contrast , the medium is transparent to the leading photons in direct photon - jet correlations .",
    "one expect that the away side jet behave exactly as the single jet suppression : @xmath11 .",
    "the level of accuracy in extracting the jet signal depends on how well one determines the elliptic flow of both particles , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and combinatoric background level @xmath2 .",
    "phenix measures the elliptic flow through the reaction plane ( rp ) method , where the event plane ( ep ) is determined by the bbc at forward region ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the systematic error on the @xmath14 is dominated by the ep resolution , @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath2 represents the ratio of the combinatoric background in same event to that in mixed event : @xmath16 .",
    "it is typically slightly above 1 due to finite multiplicity fluctuation in a typical centrality bin .",
    "the uncertainty on the correlation function can be expressed as : @xmath17 given the typical values of various factors : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , the above formula can be simplified as @xmath22",
    "phenix has previously used two methods in determining the @xmath2 : the absolute normalization ( abn ) method  @xcite and zero yield at minimum ( zyam ) method  @xcite .",
    "the zyam method assumes there is a point in @xmath23 where jet yield is zero , i.e the background term `` kisses '' the correlation function .",
    "the @xmath2 value from zyam method is a upper limit since the background ca nt be higher than the total in eq.[eq:1 ] .",
    "the abn method calculate @xmath2 directly by assuming a certain relation between multiplicity and centrality .    here",
    "we discuss a third method in constraining @xmath2 , based on the combined information from opposite - sign charged pairs ( osc ) and same - sign charged pairs ( ssc ) .",
    "fig.[fig : ch1]a shows the azimuthal distributions for osc and ssc for top 0 - 5% au+au collisions for @xmath24 gev/@xmath25 and @xmath26 gev/@xmath25 .",
    "the osc correlation at the near side is larger than that for ssc , while the charge combination has no effect on the back - to - back correlations .",
    "the difference of the jet strength at the near side is a consequence of the charge ordering effect in the jet fragmentation process , which leads to more osc pairs than ssc pairs .",
    "one would not expect any charge correlation between the pair at the @xmath27 , since they come from different jets .",
    "the zyam method clearly finds different @xmath2 values between the two although their true values should be identical .",
    "fig.[fig : ch1]b shows the jet signal estimated independently for osc and ssc using the zyam approach .",
    "the estimated away side jet yield for osc and ssc pairs are clearly different due to the difference in @xmath2 from zyam .    in both cases ,",
    "the zyam minimum is at around the same @xmath28 .",
    "the difference at that point indicated different amount of near side jet contribution . given that the near side jet width are the same between ssc and osc pairs  @xcite",
    ", jet contribution can be written explicitly for the two cases as , @xmath29 define @xmath30 , i.e. the difference in the @xmath2 value between osc and ssc pairs , we got @xmath31 the near side jet contribution at the @xmath32 can be calculated from the near side jet peak value ( at @xmath33 ) , which is given by zyam method . since the jet fraction is large at the peak region , fractional error of the peak values due to uncertain on @xmath2 from zyam is small .",
    "we include it in final systematic error .",
    "the results of this procedure is shown in fig.[fig : ch1]d .",
    "the subtracted distribution are identical on the away side but shifted above 0 as expected .",
    "the charged dependence method is useful when the statistic is good , such that @xmath2 is well constrained at the zyam minimum and @xmath34 can be reliability estimated .",
    "we recognize that there could be contributions from away side jet at zyam minimum also , @xmath35 , which is inaccessible in current approach .",
    "thus the @xmath2 value obtained in this method could still be too big .",
    "table.[tab : xi ] summarize the @xmath2 values obtained from the three methods .",
    ".[tab : xi ] @xmath2 values calculated for @xmath36 gev/@xmath25 and @xmath37 gev/@xmath25 bin compared between three different normalization method for several centrality selections . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "let s define @xmath38 as ep resolution for @xmath39th order harmonics using the elliptic flow rp . according to  @xcite , the pair distribution when the triggers are selected in a limited angular bite of @xmath40 with respect to reaction plane is @xmath41 fig.[fig : rp]a shows the cfs in 0 - 5% central au+au collisions for 6 angular bins in @xmath42 steps .",
    "fig.[fig : rp]b shows the jet yield after subtracting the flow terms calculated according to eq.[eq : rp ] . although the cfs change dramatically from in plane to out of plane , the calculated flow term tracks the true flow background nicely .",
    "given the small eccentricity in 0 - 5% , we can safely assume that the jet yield , @xmath43 does not depends on the trigger direction .",
    "in this case , the small difference between the jet functions in fig.[fig : rp]b can be used to further constrain the @xmath14 .",
    "reliable extraction of the jet signal requires accurate determination of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . to this end ,",
    "contributions from non - flow correlations that lead to azimuth correlations not related to the true rp direction , need to be studied .",
    "the non - flow correlations include transverse momentum conservation effects , resonance decays , hbt correlations that are important at low @xmath4  @xcite and jet correlations that are important at high @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the non - flow correlations affect the @xmath14 values either by changing the ep resolution or cause fake @xmath14 by biasing the ep direction towards the now - flow particles .",
    "the former is small if the non - flow particle multiplicity is small .",
    "the later can be suppressed in phenix if the correlations are limited in a narrow @xmath44 window , such as the resonance and intra - jet correlations , thanks to the large @xmath45 separation between bbc and central arm . however , the inter - jet correlations can still bias the bbc reaction plane determination , due to their broad distribution in @xmath44 .",
    "we study the biases due to dijet correlations by embedding dijet pairs into background events with realistic flow modulation .",
    "the background au+au events are simulated with hijing , which was checked to reproduce the charged hadron multiplicity in @xmath45 from phobos .",
    "elliptic flow is implemented by applying a track by track weight for each hijing event : @xmath46 where the @xmath47 is the direction of the impact parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the centrality , @xmath4 dependence of the @xmath14 is tuned according to the phenix measurement  @xcite .",
    "we used a common @xmath45 dependence from phobos  @xcite for all centrality selections .",
    "the dijet pairs are generated from pythia event generator , requiring a leading particle above 6 gev/@xmath25 at mid - rapidity ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this corresponds to typical energy of @xmath50 gev/@xmath25 for the dijets .",
    "the effects of the dijets are evaluated by comparing the event plane before and after the embedding . since dijet pairs are random with respect to the rp , the ep resolution for combined event is worse as shown in fig.[fig : v2reso ] .",
    "the difference in ep resolution is small except in peripheral bins where the event multiplicity is small . and",
    "the difference become negligible in more forward @xmath45 window . on the other hand , dijet tends to pull the event plane towards the dijet direction , resulting in a fake @xmath14 for the leading hadrons as shown in fig.[fig : rpembed ] , where the relative azimuth distribution between the leading hadrons and ep from either the hijing event or the combined event are plotted .",
    "the dijets are clearly correlated with the ep determined from the combined event , thus have a fake @xmath14 .",
    "the size of the fake @xmath14 depends on the rapidity gap between the triggering hadron and the subevent used to determine the event plane . due to the away side jet swing",
    ", one would expect the this bias persists to large @xmath45 region .",
    "fig.[fig : v2bias ] shows the centrality dependence of fake @xmath14 for various rapidity window .",
    "this fake @xmath14 is the raw signal extracted from fit in fig.[fig : rpembed ] without divided by ep resolution .",
    "the fake @xmath14 decreases as the subevent moves towards large @xmath45 . when the subevent is @xmath0 ( bbc acceptance ) , the fake @xmath14 becomes almost negligible .",
    "so far , we have assumed normal dijet in our study .",
    "rhic data indicates that there is a broadening of the away side jet and an increase of jet multiplicity at low @xmath4 by about factor of 2  @xcite . to account for that",
    ", we increase the pythia dijet multiplicity by factor of 2 and redo the study of the rapidity dependence of the fake @xmath14 .",
    "we did not take into account the broadening of the near side jet in @xmath45 , since it is dominated by the away side jet swing .",
    "fig.[fig : v2biasw ] shows the fake @xmath14 corrected for the ep resolution as function of rapidity window with enhanced dijet and normal dijet .",
    "the elliptic flow is higher when the jet multiplicity is doubled , but it is still negligible in the bbc acceptance .",
    "the @xmath14 measurements can also be affected by the event by event fluctuation of @xmath14  @xcite , which is a direct consequence to the event by event fluctuation of the collision geometry . however , since the two particle correlation method is used in this analysis , the event by event fluctuations would also contribute to the @xmath14 correlations . in this sense",
    "the @xmath51 should be the one to use in eq.[eq:1 ] .",
    "since @xmath51 was shown to be consistent with the bbc rp @xmath14  @xcite up to 4 gev/@xmath25 in @xmath4 , it is reasonable to using bbc rp @xmath14 in eq.[eq:1 ] .",
