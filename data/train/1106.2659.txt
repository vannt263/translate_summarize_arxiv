    "the universe acceleration , shown by several astronomical observations , indicates the existence of a mysterious exotic matter called dark energy ( de ) @xcite . in the classical gravity , whereas the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , is the most prominent candidate of de with the equation of state ( eos ) parameter equals -1 @xcite , there are strong evidence for a dynamical de equation of state .",
    "however , the problem of de , its energy density and eos parameter is still an unsolved problem in classical gravity and may be in the context of quantum gravity we achieve a more inclusive insight to its properties @xcite .",
    "the hde model is an attempt to apply the nature of de within the framework of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the holographic principle states that the number of degrees of freedom describing the physics inside a volume ( including gravity ) is bounded by the area of the boundary which encloses this volume and thus relates to entropy scales with the enclosing area of the system @xcite .",
    "since the entropy scales like the area rather than the volume , the fundamental degrees of freedom describing the system are characterized by an effective quantum field theory in a box of size @xmath1 with one fewer space dimensions and with planck - scale uv cut - off @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by the author in @xcite , in quantum field theory , short distance cut - off @xmath0 is related to long distance cut - off @xmath1 due to the limit set by forming a black hole . in other words , if @xmath2 is the quantum zero - point energy density caused by a uv cut - off @xmath0 , the total energy of the system with size @xmath1 should not exceed the mass of the same size black hole , i.e. @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes planck mass @xcite . for the largest @xmath1 , holographic energy density is given by , @xmath5 in which c is a free dimensionless parameter and coefficient three is for convenience @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath1 as the universe current size , the hubble radius @xmath6 , then the de density is close to the observational result , which we identify with the radius of the future event horizon , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is scale factor of the universe @xcite .",
    "choosing the future event horizon as the uv cut - off allows us to construct a satisfactory hde model for the universe accelerating expansion which presents a dynamical view of the de and is consistent with observational data @xcite .",
    "the interacting hde ( ihde ) models have been widely investigated in last few years @xcite . among all , the stability analysis of the ihde solutions and their dynamical characteristics @xcite , ihde due to the bulk - brane interaction @xcite and ihde in non - flat cosmological model @xcite are of particular interest .",
    "in particular , relevant works in the holographic tachyon models in both interacting and non interacting cases can be found in @xcite@xcite@xcite . in here , we would like to extend the previous works carried out in the ihde models , by studying a chameleon - tachyon cosmological model . in our model",
    "the scalar field in the formalism plays two roles ; as a chameleon field interacts with the matter in the universe and as a tachyon field plays the role of de . in the previous works in ihde models ,",
    "the interacting term between ihde and dark matter ( dm ) is not unique and its introduction in the formalism based on phenomenological grounds in studying a suitable coupling between quintessence scalar field and pressureless cold dark matter ( cdm ) to alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "however , in our work the interacting term naturally appears in the model from the interaction between chameleon field and matter field in the universe in the formalism .",
    "we consider the chameleon gravity in the presence of cdm with a tachyon potential in the action given by@xcite@xcite , @xmath9\\sqrt{-g}d^{4}x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is ricci scalar . unlike the usual einstein - hilbert action",
    ", the matter lagrangian @xmath11 is modified as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an analytic function of @xmath14 .",
    "this last term in the lagrangian brings about the nonminimal interaction between the matter and chameleon field .",
    "the variation of action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric tensor components in a spatially flat frw cosmology yields the following field equations , @xmath15 where @xmath16 . in the above",
    ", we also assumed a perfect fluid filled the universe with the eos @xmath17 .",
    "we can rewrite the above equations as , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the energy density and pressure of the tachyon .",
    "the variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the scalar field @xmath14 provides the wave equation for the scalar field as @xmath21 where prime `` @xmath22 '' indicated differentiation with respect to @xmath14 and @xmath23 . the scalar field as a tachyon field plays the role of ihde and by coupling with the matter field as a chameleon field plays the role of dm .",
    "then , by their interaction , the energy densities no longer satisfy independent conservation laws , rather , they obey : @xmath24 @xmath25 where `` ch '' stands for chameleon , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the interaction term . in @xmath28 , @xmath29 gauges the intensity of the coupling between matter and chameleon field . for @xmath30 , there is no interaction between dm and ihde .",
    "the @xmath28 term measures the different evolution of the dm due to its interaction with the ihde which gives rise to a different universe expansion .",
    "the remarkable point concerning the interaction term is that in comparison to the other ihde models where the form of the interaction term @xmath28 is not unique and built into the formalism from the outset , in our model the interaction term naturally appears in the model directly as a function of the chameleon coupling function @xmath13 and @xmath31 and indirectly as a function of hubble parameter @xmath32 and @xmath19 . for the decay of hde into dm in the interaction we have to take @xmath33 to be positive similar to the case of @xmath34 in the interaction term @xmath35 introduced in other works @xcite .    in order to impose the holographic nature to the tachyon",
    ", one should identify the energy density of tachyon field with the energy density of the cosmological constant . from the definition of the holographic energy density , equation ( [ rol ] ) , and that of the future event horizon ( [ re ] ) we obtain @xcite@xcite , @xmath36 where the derivative in here and from now on is with respect to @xmath37 , also , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we can rewrite equation ( [ ct ] ) as @xmath40 from equations ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ ro1 ] ) we drive the dynamical eos parameter as @xmath41 we have to note , however , that although the above eos parameter attributed to the tachyon field , the presence of the @xmath13 in the interaction term is directly related to the chameleon field and dm .",
    "so the situation is somewhat ambiguous due to entanglement of the de and dm . under these conditions",
    ", one can not easily classify the quintessence or phantom unless the interacting term is very weak according to observations . using equations ( [ ro1 ] ) and ( [ omegat ] ) and the definition of @xmath42 we find @xmath43 also , by replacing @xmath44 and @xmath45 into the acceleration equation ( [ fried2 ] ) , one obtains , @xmath46 from equations ( [ hz ] ) and ( [ hz2 ] ) , we drive the evolution equation for @xmath42 in terms of the redshift @xmath47 as , @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which controls the dynamics of the ihde model . from equation ( [ hz2 ] )",
    ", the evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath49 with respect to the redshift @xmath47 can be expressed as @xmath50 using equation ( [ fried11 ] ) , and @xmath51 , we derive the interacting holographic tachyon potential , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the critical energy density of the universe at the present epoch . in addition , using the relation @xmath54 , the evolution of the interacting holographic tachyon scalar field @xmath14 with respect to the redshift z becomes , @xmath55 where the sign is arbitrary and can be changed by a redefinition of the field , @xmath56 .",
    "then , by fixing the field amplitude at the present era to be zero , one may obtain the dynamic of the holographic tachyon field .",
    "it is difficult to solve equations ( [ omegaz])-([phi ] ) analytically , however , the evolutionary form of the interacting holographic tachyon field @xmath14 and @xmath42 can be easily obtained by integrating it numerically from @xmath57 to a given value @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , from the constructed holographic tachyon model , the evolution of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath14 can be determined .    in the following numerical computation , we assume that the function @xmath13 behaves exponentially as @xmath59 . since @xmath60 is present in the interaction term @xmath28 , the parameters that directly determine the dynamics of the interaction are @xmath61 and @xmath33 together with @xmath31 and @xmath62 .",
    "note that @xmath63 or @xmath64 leads to the absence of the interaction .    in fig . 1 and 2 ,",
    "by solving the equations ( [ omegaz])-([phi ] ) , the reconstructed scalar field @xmath65 and @xmath58 are shown .",
    "the curves are plotted for different values of @xmath61 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and with the fractional matter density selected to be @xmath68 . from fig .",
    "2 , the reconstructed tachyon potentials are more steep in the early epoch ( @xmath69 ) and tending to be flat in near future when the scalar field @xmath14 is negative .",
    "therefore , the tachyon scalar field rolls down the potential more slowly with the kinetic energy gradually decreasing in near future where from fig .",
    "3a the tachyon eos parameter become tangent to -1 when @xmath70 .",
    "this scenario is similar to the holographic quintessence scenario @xcite .",
    "note that , from fig.1 , the tachyon scalar field increases with @xmath47 , becomes finite at high redshift and decreases as the universe expands .",
