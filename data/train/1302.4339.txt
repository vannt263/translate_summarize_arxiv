    "the graph on the right - hand side shows a typical exit flow curve .",
    "possible gas transport characteristics that can be obtained from such an experiment are the mean value and higher moments of the molecular _ time of escape_.    the central question then is : what can these time characteristics of the gas outflow tell us about the microscopic interaction ( i.e. , scattering properties ) between gas molecules and the surface of the plates ?    for a more precise formulation of this question , we begin by describing the classical surface scattering operators that model the microscopic collisions of the point mass .",
    "we refer to the boundary of the channel region as the ( wall ) _ surface _ , irrespective of its actual dimension .",

    "elements of @xmath7 represent velocities of a point mass immediately after a collision with the surface . by identifying @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we may regard pre - collision velocities as also being in @xmath7 . a _ collision event _ is then specified by a measurable map @xmath11 where @xmath12 indicates the space of probability measures on the upper - half plane .",
    "the measurability condition is understood as follows : for every essentially bounded borel measurable function @xmath13 on @xmath7 , the function @xmath14 is also measurable .",
    "we refer to @xmath5 as the _ collision operator_. this operator specifies the transition probabilities of markov chains with state space @xmath7 giving the sequence of post - collision velocities from which the molecular random flight inside the channel can be obtained .",

    "the graph on the right represents the rate at which gas escapes . from this function",
    "it is possible to derive mean exit time of escape @xmath15 .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=508 ]     if now @xmath16 denotes the expected exit time of the random flight , where @xmath17 is the molecular root - mean square velocity , then a more restricted form of the general question is to understand how @xmath15 depends on @xmath5 .",
    "( this expected exit time is easily measured in actual experiments involving gas diffusion using the rate of gas outflow as represented on the right hand side of figure [ exit flow ] ; see , for example , @xcite for so - called tap - experiments in chemical kinetics . )",
    "although the analysis of @xmath5 is generally simpler in dimension @xmath6 , an interesting complication arises here that is not present in the case of a @xmath18-dimensional cylinder ; namely , with respect to the stationary distribution of velocities for natural collision operators ( see the next subsection ) , molecular displacement between collisions has infinite variance and standard central limit theorems for markov chains do not apply .",
    "the same is true for the random flight in the region @xmath19 $ ] between two parallel plates . in this regard ,",

    "because of this assumption of incommensurability between the micro and macro scales , the relevant scattering properties specifying @xmath5 are invariant under homotheties .",
    "thus in dimension @xmath6 we may , when convenient , assume that the width of each cell is 1 .",
    "this incommensurability also dictates our assumption that the particle position on the entrance of a cell at the beginning of a collision event is a uniformly distributed random variable .",
