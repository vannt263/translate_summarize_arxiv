    "so far there is no consensus on the interpretation of the hard diffractive scattering processes measured at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "invariably the rates measured at the tevatron are much smaller than would be expected using the diffractive parton density functions measured in diffractive deep inelastic scattering at hera @xcite . on the one hand",
    "this is not in contradiction with theory since the diffractive parton density functions extracted in deep inelastic scattering are not expected to be applicable in diffractive scattering involving incoming hadrons @xcite .",
    "however , there is the hope that this breaking of universality might be described in terms of an overall multiplicative `` gap survival '' factor @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we turn our attention to diffractive vector boson production at the tevatron .",
    "we perform an analysis using the diffractive parton density functions extracted by the h1 collaboration @xcite with one important modification .",
    "namely , we use a larger effective pomeron intercept , i.e. @xmath4 rather than the value 1.203 extracted by h1 distribution , assuming a factorisation of the diffractive parton density into a product of a function of @xmath5 and a function of @xmath6 . ] .",
    "we believe this to be a natural choice given that the scale associated with diffractive @xmath1 production is some two orders of magnitude larger than that in diffractive dis at hera , and given that there is evidence for an effective pomeron intercept which increases slowly as the hard scale increases @xcite .",
    "we include the rather poorly constrained reggeon exchange contribution , also as determined by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : w ] we focus on @xmath1 boson production as measured by cdf @xcite .",
    "this process has been studied within a similar framework previously @xcite where it was found that the rates based upon direct extrapolation of the deep inelastic parton density functions typically overestimate the cdf data by an order of magnitude .",
    "however , neither of these analyses used a hard pomeron flux , nor did they consider the reggeon contribution .",
    "possible explanations for the largeness of the theoretical cross - section have been presented @xcite , some based upon the concept of gap survival @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss the issue of gap survival in section [ sec : gs ] .    throughout our study",
    ", we shall perform our calculations using the relevant leading order electroweak matrix elements .",
    "in addition , we compare to results obtained using a modified version of herwig , which we call pomwig , that is able to generate diffractive scattering in a wide range of processes@xcite .",
    "our studies of diffractive @xmath1 production conclude that the reggeon contribution is probably not negligible .",
    "it is poorly understood and more studies are needed in order to reduce the uncertainty from this source .",
    "furthermore , we propose that the rate for pomeron initiated processes is much smaller than has been found hitherto , due mainly to our use of diffractive parton densities with a steeper @xmath5 dependence than occurs in softer pomeron exchange models . in section",
    "[ sec : dy ] we examine diffractive drell - yan production in order to investigate the additional information that can be obtained at the tevatron . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "for diffractive vector boson production in proton - antiproton collisions with a fast forward proton we use the general formula + @xmath7 for the rapidity ( @xmath8 ) distribution of the lepton which is produced in the decay of the boson . using the language of ingelman & schlein @xcite ,",
    "the pomeron flux factor is @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the parton distribution function for partons of flavour @xmath11 in the pomeron . as is conventional , @xmath5 is the fraction of the proton energy carried by the pomeron and @xmath6 is the fraction of the pomeron energy carried by the parton involved in the hard scatter .",
    "the @xmath12 centre - of - mass energy is denoted @xmath13 gev@xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the anti - proton distribution for partons of flavour @xmath16 . throughout",
    "we take the factorisation scale @xmath17 to be the subprocess centre - of - mass energy @xmath18 .    in the particular case of @xmath19 production",
    "we use the narrow width approximation to write the rapidity distribution of the scattered electron ( throughout this paper positive rapidity is defined in the proton direction ) : + @xmath20 @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 incoming partons or @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 incoming partons .",
    "@xmath27 in the case that a quark from the pomeron participates in the hard scatter and @xmath28 when it is an anti - quark , where + @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the scattering angle of the scattered electron in the parton - parton centre - of - mass frame measured relative to the proton direction . in the case of @xmath32 production",
    "it is necessary to make the interchange @xmath33 if we are to define @xmath8 as the rapidity of the scattered positron .",
    "we integrate over @xmath34 with @xmath35 gev and all @xmath36 .",
    "these are the cuts used by the cdf collaboration .    in order to compute the ratio of diffractive to non - diffractive events we use a similar expression for the non - diffractive cross - section , i.e. by replacing the pomeron flux factor by @xmath37 and the pomeron parton densities by the proton ones . in computing this ratio",
    "we integrate over the cdf range , @xmath38 .",
    "our default is to use the h1 pomeron flux , with an increased value for the pomeron intercept , i.e. + @xmath39 and integrate over all @xmath40 ( in practise it is sufficient to integrate over @xmath41 gev@xmath42 ) .",
    "the normalisation @xmath43 is defined so that the flux is equal to 1 at @xmath44 . note that this is a significantly steeper flux than that proposed by donnachie & landshoff ( dl)@xcite , which is roughly equivalent to the above flux except for the replacement of 1.90 by 1.17 .",
    "for the pomeron parton densities we use the favoured leading order h1 fit 2 .",
    "we always use the grv94 lo parton densities for incoming hadrons @xcite .    for the reggeon we simply replace the pomeron flux with @xcite + @xmath45 and the pomeron parton densities",
    "are replaced by the grv leading order pion densities of @xcite .",
    "this is the reggeon contribution that was shown to agree with the h1 data collected in the range @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we ignore any possible interference between the pomeron and the reggeon although this may be important .    in figure",
    "[ fig : w - theory ] we show the rapidity distribution of the scattered lepton for both the pomeron and reggeon contributions . in all cases",
    "the electron distribution is more forward peaked than the positron due to the chiral nature of the @xmath1 interactions . note the significant suppression obtained when using the hard flux as compared to the dl flux .",
    "this is a consequence of the flatter @xmath5 distribution in the latter case  a small effect at @xmath5 values typical for hera but not so for the much larger @xmath5 values probed at the tevatron .",
    "the fact that the tevatron is at significantly larger @xmath5 is also responsible for the large contribution from the reggeon . also significant",
    "is the fact that the peaks of the lepton distributions are more backward when using the hard flux compared to the dl flux .",
    "this arises because the larger @xmath5 values in the dl case lead to a smaller boost to negative rapidity than occurs using the h1 flux .",
    "the implication is that when we integrate over the cdf acceptance region ( @xmath47 ) a larger fraction of the leptons produced using the hard flux fall outside the region of acceptance thereby still further reducing the predicted cross - section .",
    "the bottom line is that the ratio of diffractive to non - diffractive events , summed over the electron and positron , and multiplied by 2 to account for proton and antiproton dissociation , is much smaller in the case of the hard flux compared to the dl flux .",
    "in particular we find @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the ratio of pomeron exchange events to non - diffractive events integrated over the cdf acceptance region .",
    "this is to be compared to the cdf value for the ratio of diffractive to non - diffractive events , @xmath51 .",
    "however , we can not avoid the reggeon contribution . including it leads to a ratio @xmath52 using pomwig",
    ", this ratio is only very slightly different at 1.72% .    before leaving this section",
    "it is necessary to make a few remarks regarding the uncertainty in this theoretical result .",
    "there is a large uncertainty associated with what we have called the effective pomeron intercept , since there is no existing measurement of this parameter in the kinematic range relevant to the tevatron .",
    "we have used the h1 fits for the diffractive parton density functions .",
    "these density functions are only evolved up to @xmath53 gev@xmath42 and remain constant thereafter .",
    "we have also obtained results using the actw parton density functions @xcite , which are evolved to high @xmath54 and from which we are able to estimate that normal qcd evolution will change our prediction for the gap fraction by no more than 20% .",
    "next - to - leading order qcd corrections are expected to play a role at the 10 - 20% level .",
    "there is also an uncertainty in the size of the reggeon contribution that is hard to quantify .",
    "so far we have ignored the fact that factorisation is not expected to hold in hard diffraction at the tevatron .",
    "one might attempt to account for this physics by an overall multiplicative factor which specifies the probability that the rapidity gap is destroyed by additional interactions which are not strongly correlated with the primary hard scatter .",
    "we aim in this section to add plausibility to this assumption and to make an estimate for the gap survival factor .    in a previous paper @xcite we used the multiple interactions model implemented in the pythia event generator to estimate the gap survival probability in gap - between jets events @xcite .",
    "in this model the number of additional scatters , given a particular hard trigger process , is dependent only on the total energy of the collisions and of the scale of the hard trigger process .",
    "the estimate of the survival probability obtained was 22% for 1800 gev and 35% for 630 gev and was largely independent of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the jets .",
    "the increase of multiple interactions with the total energy is simply due to the small-@xmath55 proliferation of gluons which are available for additional scatterings .",
    "the dependence on the hard scale can be described in a simplified manner as follows .",
    "the model assumes that the partons in the proton are distributed according to a double gaussian in impact - parameter space .",
    "this means that central collisions with a small impact parameter have a higher probability for multiple scatterers than do peripheral ones with a large impact parameter . for the case of @xmath1-production ,",
    "which we are interested in here , the procedure is to generate the hard electroweak scattering and then to choose an impact parameter depending on the scale of the process  the higher the scale the larger the probability to pick a small impact parameter .",
    "the overlap is then calculated from this and the number of additional scatterers is obtained .",
    "( note that the procedure becomes more complicated if a trigger process with large cross section is used , since the eikonalisation of the cross section becomes important in that case . )    in principle it is possible to run pompyt @xcite with the multiple interactions of pythia .",
    "this will , however , only give multiple interactions between the colliding anti - proton and pomeron , and such scatterings will not destroy the gap .",
    "what we need is to estimate the multiple interactions between the proton and anti - proton . here",
    "the scale which determines the overlap is not the hard scale of the electroweak @xmath1-production process , but rather the momentum transfer of the pomeron @xmath56 , which is small .",
    "so , although the overlap between the pomeron and anti - proton is large , the overlap between the proton and anti - proton may be small , resulting in a gap - survival probability much larger than the ones quoted above .",
    "since it is not possible simply to add multiple interactions between the proton and anti - proton in pompyt , we use the fact that the amount of multiple scattering only depends upon the scale of the process and the total collision energy . using different triggering processes which are able to go to small scales without large eikonalisation effects in pythia ( using default parameters ) we find that the probability not to have any additional scatters saturates for small momentum transfers at around 50% . in figure",
    "[ fig : gs ] we show this probability for proton - antiproton scattering via the electromagnetic @xmath57 and @xmath58 sub - processes .    for large scales",
    "the probability is well below the 22% we quoted in @xcite .",
    "this is because of the way partons from multiple scatterings are colour - connected to the rest of the event in pythia . with the default parameters only 1/3 of the multiple scatterings will be colour - connected to the rest of the event , while the remaining scatterings will produce colour singlet @xmath59 or @xmath60-pairs which will not necessarily destroy the gap . in figure",
    "[ fig : gs ] we therefore also show the probability of having at least one colourful secondary scatter .",
    "the true gap fraction ought to lie somewhere in between these two extremes .",
    "there are large uncertainties here .",
    "multiple interactions are poorly understood and the multiple interaction model in pythia has not been tuned to describe these processes .",
    "it is , however , natural to assume that any rapidity gap produced due to the exchange of a pomeron or a reggeon may be destroyed by multiple interactions .",
    "it is also very intuitive that these processes are more peripheral than other hard interactions and that the survival probability therefore should be larger than in the case of , e.g. high-@xmath40 diffraction .",
    "the model in pythia does attempt to take such physics into account .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that more effort must be devoted to understanding these processes before we can start to compare the diffractive results from hera with the ones from the tevatron with confidence .",
    "the results of this section suggest that we should take a gap survival factor of around 60% for low @xmath40 diffraction at the tevatron , running at 1.8 tev .",
    "this should be compared to other models which typically predict gap survival factors of 10% or less @xcite .",
    "accounting for this gap survival factor we find a gap fraction of    @xmath61 which is in good agreement with the tevatron measurement .",
    "in order to test our understanding of diffractive vector particle production , it would be useful not only to measure the rapidity distribution of the charged lepton in @xmath62 production but also to do the same for the diffractive drell - yan production process and in this section we present our predictions .",
    "the rapidity distribution of the scattered lepton can be computed : + @xmath63 the advantage of the drell - yan process is the ability to tune the invariant mass of the dilepton pair and in figure [ fig : dy - theory ] we show the cross - section as a function of invariant mass , @xmath64 , integrated over @xmath65 for both the pomeron and reggeon contributions .",
    "the solid black line represents a hard pomeron with effective intercept @xmath4 , the dotted line represents a hard pomeron with an effective intercept @xmath66 , and the broken line is the reggeon contribution .",
    "the histrograms are the pomwig results , and the non - vanishing at low @xmath67 is a result of the correct matching to the nlo matrix elements that is performed in herwig 6.1 .    to match smoothly with the hera data it is perhaps more reasonable to use an effective intercept that depends upon the hard subprocess scale .",
    "this possibility leads to the dash - dot curve in figure [ fig : dy - theory ] where we have used @xmath68 we wish to stress that this is an entirely phenomenological parameterisation . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", such an @xmath5 dependence can not be generated by exchange of a single regge pole .",
    "however this effective behaviour could describe the interplay of two or more regge exchanges .",
    "for example , in a two - pomeron model one might imagine that the harder pomeron , with intercept around 1.45 , dominates at the tevatron whilst at hera there is an important admixture of the softer pomeron - this would lead to qualitatively the behaviour we examine here @xcite .",
    "alternatively , within the leading - twist pqcd formalism , the @xmath5-dependence should not exhibit any @xmath54 dependence since all of the evolution is contained within what we call the pomeron parton distribution functions . in this case",
    ", one should interpret our parameterization as an indication that there is an important higher - twist component in the relatively low @xmath54 hera data that is absent in the tevatron data .",
    "we have shown that the current tevatron data on diffractive @xmath62 production can be understood in terms of the diffractive parton densities extracted from hera data provided we use a hard pomeron intercept , @xmath69 . modelling the diffractive parton densities in terms of pomeron and reggeon contributions , we find that the reggeon contribution is approximately equal to the pomeron contribution in the kinematic regime relevant for the tevatron .",
    "moreover , we propose that the pomeron contribution is much smaller than previous estimates .",
    "we used pythia to model the gap survival probability and found it to be quite large at 60% . in conclusion",
    "we find a gap fraction in @xmath62 production of 1.00% which is to be compared to the cdf result of @xmath70 .",
    "a precise comparison between theory and data is not yet possible due primarily to lack of understanding of gap survival effects and of the reggeon contribution .",
    "future data collected on diffractive drell - yan production at the tevatron will certainly help clarify the physics , not least by providing valuable data over a wide range of scales , from those typical of dis at hera to those in diffractive @xmath71 production .",
    "measurements to lower @xmath5 at the tevatron will also be important in helping disentangle the competing effects .",
    "the natural next step is to compare the model presented here to the data for diffractive dijet production @xcite and diffractive central jet production @xcite .",
    "preliminary investigations suggest that the existing contradictions will be resolved - we deal with these processes in a future publication .",
    "we should like to thank dino goulianos , hannes jung , andy mehta , paul newman , julian phillips and mike seymour for their valuable assistance .",
