    "<S> we propose a controllable way of tuning fano resonances in open quantum dots in the absence of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum dot can be modified by changing the gate voltages that define the dot itself . </S>",
    "<S> an extra degree of freedom can be introduced by means of a controllable repulsive perturbation , such as the one induced by scanning a atomic force microscope tip on a real sample . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically investigate the coupling between localized states in the dot and the continuum in the leads . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of such position controllable perturbation is the selective manipulation of the quantum dot states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this could be a feasible alternative to quantum dots in aharonov - bohm interferometers as a fano resonance tuning device .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs number(s ) 73.40.gk,73.21.fg,73.21.la    in the past few years , mesoscopic systems became appropriate tools for investigating wave function interference effects . </S>",
    "<S> the nanometer - scale technology turned into reality structures with dimensions that are smaller than the phase coherence length . </S>",
    "<S> the prototype are systems created in a two - dimensional high - mobility electron gas ( 2deg ) at the interface of a gaas / algaas heterostructure structured by means of the split gates technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two important examples should be mentioned here : the quantum point contact ( qpc ) , where conductance quantization has been seen @xcite ; and the quantum dot ( qd ) , with a wide range of interesting transport properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> starting from these two devices , systems of greater complexity have been conceived and fabricated for controling electronic wave function interference effects . </S>",
    "<S> a recent example of such effort is the imaging of the coherent electron flow through qpc , where the interference effects can be controlled by scanning an atomic force microscope ( afm ) tip over the sample @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another example , related to the present work is the tunable fano resonance in an aharonov - bohm interferometer with an embebed qd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that fano resonances could be completely tunable in open quantum dot ( oqd ) structures by moving a local perturbation across the system , like a tip of an afm . indeed </S>",
    "<S> such a procedure enables a selective manipulation of the qd states . up to now , in absence of magnetic fields , fano resonances have been only partially tuned by changing gate voltages in single - electron transistors . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the present approach </S>",
    "<S> , a continuous system is discretized into a lattice , considering a single @xmath0-like orbital per site and only nearest - neighbour hopping elements . </S>",
    "<S> the oqd structure , emulated by a tight - binding lattice model is depicted in fig.1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the black circle represent a potential columm simulating the perturbation induced , for instance , by an afm tip located on the sample at that position . in what follows we consider perturbations of a single host lattice site ( @xmath1 ) , which corresponds to a extension relative to the quantum dot of @xmath1/@xmath2=1/49 for oqd with dimensions @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the host lattice parameter ( fig.1(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the repulsive perturbation will be characterized by a height @xmath5 in the range between @xmath6 mev and @xmath7 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the tight - binding hopping parameters are chosen in order to emulate the electronic effective mass for the gaas bottom of the conduction band , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ev for a lattice parameter of @xmath11  . </S>",
    "<S> such parametrization represents quantum dots with lateral sizes up to @xmath12 , at least one order of magnitude lower than the typical dimensions of actual quantum dots constructed by litographic methods . </S>",
    "<S> however , the present work has the proposal of illustrating a selective manipulation of confined states . here </S>",
    "<S> the relevant energy scale is @xmath13 ev . for systems ten times larger , the new energy scale would be of the order of @xmath14 mev , still accessible for available temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> another relevant scale is the ratio between the extension of the perturbative spike and the dot dimension , @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> a previous work @xcite suggests that the energy shifts are qualitatively insensitive to this ratio if the perturbation height , @xmath5 , is less than @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> the afm tip can also be seen as a controllable impurity in a quantum dot and therefore a simple tunable experimental realization of a multiply connected nanostructure @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we will interested in the transmission probabilities and local density of states ( ldos ) , which are obtained by means of green s functions approaches . for the ldos we follow a self - energy method </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the total hamiltonian , @xmath17 , is a sum of four terms : the dot connected to the two point contacts regions , described by the @xmath18 , the left and rigth contact regions , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ; as well as the coupling term between the contacts and the dot structure , @xmath21 :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 describes the interaction between device and contacts . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding green s function is given by    @xmath24    we define the green s functions for the isolated contacts :    @xmath25    using equation ( 1 ) in ( 2 ) we obtain :    @xmath26    the greens function of the device , @xmath27 , result in    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the so called self - energies which describe the effects of the leads on the device . </S>",
    "<S> the propagators in the transverse mode representation for the isolated contacts , @xmath31 are :    @xmath32    with    @xmath33\\ ] ]    the matrix elements of the unitary transformation matrix , @xmath34 , which transforms the greens function from site to transverse mode representation ( @xmath35 ) are :    @xmath36    where n ( transverse site ) and @xmath37 ( transverse mode ) are row and columm indexes of the @xmath34 matrix , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath38 , @xmath23 , @xmath39 and @xmath34 are @xmath40x@xmath40 matrices , where @xmath40 is the number of transverse sites . using equation ( 5 ) we obtain the ldos :    @xmath41\\ ] ]    where m is the longitudinal site . </S>",
    "<S> this ldos is proportional to the probability density of a state of energy e. finally , a green s function is related to the conductance by the landauer - bttiker formula @xcite , by means of a recursive solution of the dyson equation as discussed elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can control the coupling of oqd bound states to the two dimensional reservoirs by changing the width , @xmath42 , of the left and right qpcs , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) transmission probabilities as a function of the incident electron energy are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . for @xmath43 , ( continuous line ) </S>",
    "<S> we clearly see resonances in the transmission probability due to the bound states of the oqd , as well as the first conductance plateau . for wider leads , @xmath44 , ( dashed line ) we see the resonances due to oqd states shifted to lower energies , since the effective confinement is diminished with the widening of the contacts . moreover the resonance peaks are broadened because the coupling to the reservoirs is enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the conductance plateaus are also shifted to lower energies and the onset of a second plateau can be seen in the same energy range . </S>",
    "<S> two aspects related to widening the leads should be kept in mind ; ( i ) the shift in energy and broadening of the resonances are not a monotonous function of the energy ; and ( ii ) , even the shape of a resonance may the qualitatively changed , as can be seen for the antiresonance for @xmath43 changing into a peak for @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous paragraph summarizes the effects on the conductance that can be achieved by varying ( symmetrically ) the leads , i.e , the voltages of the gate electrodes that actually define the quantum dot structure . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows we will be interested in effects due to a new degree of freedom in the manipulation of the dot states , as well as the coupling between them and the continua of states in the leads . </S>",
    "<S> such new mechanism is introduced by a local potential perturbation that can be moved across the sample , like an afm tip , as suggested above . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty of this local perturbation is that the resonances may be selectively tuned , exploring the wave function symmetries of the states .    in order to explore the wave function symmetries , one has to look systematically along three symmetry axis for the present case of a square qd : along the axis connecting the leads ( x axis ) , the axis perpendicular to the line joining the leads and crossing the center of the dot ( y axis ) , and a diagonal , also crossing the center , as indicated in the sketch shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shift in energy of a certain resonance peak depends on the position of the local perturbation , since such shift is proportional to the wave function amplitude at this position @xcite :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 , is the unperturbed energy of state @xmath47 , @xmath21 is the effective perturbative potential , and @xmath48 is the probability density of the unperturbed state . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a mapping of the probability density related to a resonance peak can be obtained by a contour plot of the energy shifts as a function of the perturbation position @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we are interested not necessarily in wave function mapping , but in the related selective tuning of the resonances . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) shows contour plots of the ldos at the energies of the 4 resonances and the anti - resonance shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) for the @xmath43 wide leads case ( continuous line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the last pannel is for an energy sligthly above the anti - resonance . </S>",
    "<S> having these contour plots in mind it is straightforward to see that the width of the resonance peak is proportional to the wave function amplitude ( ldos ) leaking into the leads . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the strong localization of the fifth state , which correspond to the anti - resonance in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , as well as the clear 1d channel character at off resonance energies in the conductance plateau , @xmath49 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) .    within this framework illustrated by fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we are able to understand the effects of the position dependent perturbation . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> two important effects are shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> first , for a perturbative spike positioned at the center of the quantum dot , fig.2(a ) , we see the selective shift of the resonances in the perturbed system with @xmath50 ev(continuous line ) compared to the unperturbed one ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly identify that important shifts ( for the lowest resonance and the anti - resonance ) occur only for those states with significant amplitude at the center of the dot . </S>",
    "<S> next , for a perturbation @xmath51 ev placed at one of the leads ( continuous line ) , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , no energy shifts of the resonances are observed . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a strong suppression of the conductance plateau can be observed , an effect which has been used recently for imaging the electron flow through quantum point contacts @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the selective resonance shifts on the wave function symmetries for moving the perturbative spike along the y axis can be analyzed by comparying fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> now , for @xmath52 ev ( continuous line ) and @xmath53ev ( dashed line ) , the second resonance remains almost unchanged and the lowest one is shifted , as expected from the ldos in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> having the ldos at the resonance energies in mind , it is also expected that the third resonance would be perturbed in this situation and , indeed , this resonance is not only shifted in energy but the line shape changes into a fano - like form . here </S>",
    "<S> the shift in energy affects dramatically the coupling with the continua in the leads and therefore the line shape change in the transmission probability . moving the perturbation further away from the center in the y direction , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(d ) , this third resonance evolves towards a symmetric peak again ( continuous line for @xmath54ev ) , illustrating the tunability of a specific resonance with a controllable perturbation .    </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry of the localized states in the qd give rise to two new consequences when the perturbation is moved along the diagonal , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . here dashed and continuous line are for perturbative spikes at the center and at the diagonal , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both situations are for @xmath55 ev . </S>",
    "<S> first , we observe the inversion of the fano resonance associated to @xmath56 @xcite : from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( c ) to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , the peak position is reversed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , only an off center perturbation along the diagonal breaks the symmetry of the @xmath57 state , allowing the coupling with the 1d channel and leading to a fano resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry is not broken with the perturbation positioned along the other symmetry axis ( x and y ) , since the ldos related to @xmath57 is negligible there .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we propose that scanning an afm across an open quantum dot could be an efficient tool for a selective manipulation of quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> the local perturbation induced by the tip is an important new degree of freedom in order to explore and modify resonant states . as an example , we show that the coupling of a specific level with the continuum can be tuned over a wide range in which the line shape of the associated resonance in the conductance changes from a symmetric peak into a asymmetric fano resonance , which can be inverted or tuned back into a single peak . </S>",
    "<S> this effect suggests an interesting alternative to quantum dots in aharonov - bohm interferometers @xcite as a fano resonance tuning device . </S>"
