    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the importance of nuclear effects on the final lepton polarization in neutrino - induced charged - current ( cc ) inclusive reactions of the type @xmath1 .",
    "in particular we present results for the tau polarization in @xmath2 reactions .",
    "the interest of these studies on neutrino - nucleus reactions lies on their implications for the neutrino oscillations experiments @xcite ( see @xcite and references therein for a recent review ) . some of the experiments proposed to demonstrate",
    "the @xmath3 oscillation are expecting to detect the @xmath0 production signal through the @xmath4 or @xmath5 reactions @xcite , among them the cngs project @xcite , which will send a neutrino beam from cern to the gran sasso laboratory , where the icarus and opera detectors will start taking data in the next few months .",
    "the @xmath0 decay particle distributions depend on the @xmath0 spin direction .",
    "thus the theoretical information on the @xmath0 polarization will be valuable , since the expected number of @xmath6 events will not be large @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath0 polarization is also needed , for instance , in @xmath7 oscillation experiments to disentangle @xmath8 events from background electron production following the @xmath9 oscillation @xcite .",
    "the study of lepton polarization in @xmath1 and reactions is also of theoretical interest since the polarization observables may display peculiar sensitivities to the ingredients of the nuclear and reaction models , different to the ones shown by the cross sections .",
    "however the optimal neutrino - energy regime to obtain partially polarized leptons in non - longitudinal directions is limited .",
    "the reason is that for high energy ( compared to it mass ) the final leptons are 100% polarized with negative helicity .",
    "this is the case for the electrons in @xmath8 reactions for most of the energies involved in experiments . in the case of muon production for some moderate energies , a non negligible transverse polarization component , though small ,",
    "could be observed , and some examples will be shown below in this paper .",
    "more interesting is the aforementioned case of tau leptons due to the large value of its mass .",
    "this lepton will be the main focus of this paper .",
    "previous studies of lepton polarization observables in neutrino induced reactions focus mainly on @xmath0 polarization from nucleon targets for a range of kinematics of interest @xcite@xcite .",
    "neutrino detectors are based on neutrino - nucleus interactions ( such as argon in the icarus experiment ) , and _ a priori _ one would need to evaluate the lepton polarization observables in actual finite nuclei models .",
    "genuine nuclear physics effects are usually neglected in these kind of reactions , since relatively high energies are involved .",
    "however for low to intermediate energy transfer nuclear effects do play a role in the inclusive cross section of @xmath10 reactions and in general can not be neglected ( pauli blocking , finite size effects , long and short - range correlations , final - state interactions , sub - nuclear degrees of freedom , etc . ) .",
    "this is well known from electron scattering studies , that usually are the starting point of neutrino scattering models .",
    "for the same kinematics the @xmath11 reaction , and the @xmath10 reaction in the weak - vector sector are complementary to each other and make use of the same dynamical ingredients .",
    "only the weak - axial current contribution makes a difference in the description of both reactions , since it can excite different nuclear modes .",
    "only if a given model is able to reproduce to some extent the available @xmath11 data , its predictions for neutrino reactions can be considered reliable .",
    "different theoretical approaches along these lines on neutrino reactions in nuclei can be found among the recent literature available @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe the @xmath1 reaction within the many - body framework of refs .",
    "@xcite . our model is an extension of previous studies on electron  @xcite , photon  @xcite , and pion  @xcite interactions in nuclei .",
    "it is based on a local fermi gas ( lfg ) description of the nucleus , accounting for pauli blocking .",
    "the experimental @xmath12-values are used to enforce a correct energy balance of the reaction .",
    "additional nuclear effects , essential to describe @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 reactions , are built on top of the model , in particular :    1 .",
    "coulomb distortion of the charged leptons , 2 .",
    "medium polarization , which is taken into account through the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , 3 .",
    "final - state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "the model was first applied to neutrino reactions in ref .",
    "@xcite , providing one of the best existing simultaneous description of inclusive muon capture , @xmath16 and @xmath17 reactions in @xmath18c near threshold .",
    "inclusive muon capture from other nuclei was also successfully described by the model .",
    "apart from the description of the absorption of real photons by nuclei  @xcite , the model describes rather well the @xmath19 inclusive cross section of @xmath18c , @xmath20ca and @xmath21pb for different kinematics , not only in the qe region , but also when extended to the @xmath22peak and the dip region @xcite .",
    "recently the model has been extended to the neutral current sector , and one - nucleon knock - out reactions have been studied both for cc and neutral current driven processes @xcite . a special effort has also been paid in ref .",
    "@xcite to reliably estimate the theoretical uncertainty of our model .    in this paper",
    "we extend the above model to the calculation of lepton polarization components in cc neutrino reactions . to our knowledge",
    ", only one previous study exists analyzing nuclear effects on lepton polarization @xcite .",
    "this model basically consists on a relativistic local fermi gas ( lfg ) including nuclear dynamical corrections such as some kind of relativistic rpa correlations and an effective mass for the nucleons inside the nucleus ( this is an approximate way of taking into account the fsi ) .",
    "however the model of @xcite , first presented in @xcite , has not been tested in other nuclear reactions such as @xmath11 .    in sect .",
    "2 we introduce the formalism and discuss the kinematics of the @xmath1 reaction for muon and tau leptons in order to identify the most interesting cases . in sect .",
    "3 we present results for differential cross sections and lepton polarization components , and draw our conclusions .",
    "in this work we will study the inclusive neutrino - induced reaction depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "a neutrino @xmath23 ( or anti - neutrino @xmath24 ) with four momentum @xmath25 exchanges a @xmath26 boson with an atomic nucleus with initial momentum @xmath27 , and a polarized lepton @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) is detected with four - momentum @xmath30 . in the inclusive reaction",
    "the final hadronic state is not detected . in this work",
    "we deal with the quasielastic channel , where the main contribution is due to one - nucleon emission .",
    "we write the unpolarized differential cross section as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fermi weak coupling constant , @xmath33 is the solid angle of the final lepton , and the quantity @xmath34 has been defined as @xmath35 resulting from the usual contraction between the leptonic and hadronic tensors . here",
    "@xmath36 is the angle between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the @xmath39 sign in the last term correspond to the case of neutrino or anti - neutrino scattering . finally the structure functions @xmath40 are defined in the hadronic tensor as @xmath41 with @xmath42 and the metric @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that the final lepton polarization is measured in the direction defined by the vector @xmath44 verifying @xmath45 . the polarized differential cross section ( [ sigma ] ) can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 , given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , is the cross section corresponding to unpolarized leptons and @xmath48 is the polarization vector .",
    "the relevant components of the polarization vector in the laboratory system are defined in fig . 1 and denoted @xmath49 ( longitudinal , in the direction of @xmath38 ) , and @xmath50 ( transverse to @xmath38 and contained in the scattering plane ) .",
    "working within the standard model , as we do in the present work , it can be shown that the polarization component perpendicular to the scattering plane ( fig .",
    "1 ) is zero .",
    "the expressions for the two polarization components , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , in terms of the hadronic structure functions @xmath40 are as follows @xmath51 note that the transverse polarization @xmath50 is proportional to the lepton mass .",
    "the larger values of this polarization component are then expected for tau leptons , while it will be negligible for electrons at the intermediate energies of interest for neutrino reactions .",
    "let us begin with a discussion on the kinematics of the reaction in order to identify the cases of interest .",
    "for a fixed value of the neutrino energy , @xmath52 , and from the definition of the four - momentum transfer , @xmath53 , one easily obtains the modulus of the three - momentum transfer @xmath54 , @xmath55 for a fixed value of the scattering angle , the above equation gives @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 , while the case @xmath58 leads to a parametrized curve corresponding to the the boundary of the allowed kinematical region in the @xmath59 plane .",
    "the identification of this region will help in the present work because we deal with a model describing the reaction around the quasielastic ( qe ) peak defined by @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the nucleon mass .",
    "therefore we must choose kinematics for which the qe peak lies inside the allowed region .",
    "some examples are shown in figs . 2 and 3 for muon and tau leptons , respectively .",
    "2 the muon case is displayed for four values of the neutrino energy ranging from @xmath62 to 1500 mev . in each panel",
    "we show the possible kinematics in the @xmath59-plane for several values of the scattering angle , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the lower solid lines correspond to the limit value @xmath58 , setting the lower boundary of the allowed kinematical region .",
    "the maximum value of the energy transfer @xmath65 sets the right end of the boundary . in the same plots we also show the position of the maximum of the qe peak @xmath60 with dotted lines . note that in all cases the qe peak region is inside the allowed region for @xmath66 reactions . in the plots we only show the low to intermediate energy transfer part @xmath67 mev since we are interested in the non relativistic regime where our nuclear model is safely applicable .",
    "this also means that the momentum transfer @xmath56 must be below 600 or 700 mev / c , since relativistic corrections at these values start to be important .",
    "although our nuclear model is based on a fully relativistic description of the fermi gas , the rpa and fsi corrections are non relativistic .",
    "therefore for this work we are forced to kinematics with low to intermediate energy and momentum transfer .",
    "the plots in figs 2 and 3 are very useful to this end since they give us a clear picture of the kinematical changes when the scattering angle is increased .",
    "the case of @xmath0 leptons is considered in fig . 3 for neutrino energies going from @xmath68 to 15 gev .",
    "this time the scattering angles shown are @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast to the muon case , for tau leptons the qe region is forbidden for some kinematics . in particular for low neutrino energy and low scattering angles .",
    "for instance , for @xmath52=4 gev the maximum of qe peak is below the @xmath58 curve for @xmath57 smaller than 200 mev . in order to cover this region",
    ", one should go to momentum transfers well above 800 mev / c , where relativity would play a role .",
    "therefore we must go to larger neutrino energies , above @xmath71 gev , in order to cover the qe region for small values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , for large values of @xmath52 the momentum transfer strongly increases with the scattering angle , and then we force it to fall in the few degrees region to guarantee non relativistic kinematics .",
    "our results showing the effects of the different corrections implemented into a nuclear model are summarized in figs .",
    "48 . with dotted lines",
    "we show the results of our model without rpa and without fsi corrections . hence these results account basically for the impulse approximation with neutrino - nucleon interaction of @xmath72 type .",
    "we use the galster parameterization for the nucleon vector form factors and a dipole dependence for the axial form factor , while the pseudo - scalar form factor is related to the later by the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) hypothesis .",
    "these results include also the following effects :    1 .",
    "pauli blocking , through a lfg description of the nucleus .",
    "this implies an additional dependence on the experimental nuclear density .",
    "correct energy balance of the reaction using experimental @xmath73values . in the figures we show @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 minus the @xmath12 value .",
    "coulomb distortion of the charged leptons .      in the same plots we show with dashed lines the results including rpa corrections , that take into account modification of the nuclear medium through interactions between particle - hole and @xmath22hole excitations .",
    "we use an effective nucleon  nucleon interaction , with pion and rho exchange in the vector - isovector channel , and corrections due to short - range correlations .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details about the rpa series and for explicit expressions of the nuclear structure functions @xmath40 entering in the cc neutrino cross section .",
    "finally we show with solid lines the results with the full model , including also the fsi .",
    "we account for relevant reaction mechanisms where two nucleons participate , by dressing the nucleon propagators in the nuclear medium . in particular",
    "these effects change the dispersion relation of the nucleon , which in some works is taken into account by the over - simplified method of introducing an effective mass for the nucleon @xcite .",
    "we start the discussion with fig .",
    "4 where we show typical results for the @xmath66 reaction . in the figure",
    "we show the relevant observables , namely the differential cross section and the two polarization components , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the laboratory system .",
    "the neutrino energy is @xmath74 mev , and three values of the momentum transfer @xmath75 , 400 and 500 mev / c are considered .",
    "these values of the momentum transfer correspond to lepton scattering angles of 30@xmath76 and above .",
    "the cross section shows the typical behavior of the qe peak and we can see how the different nuclear effects modify this observable .",
    "first the rpa produces a big reduction and small shift of the peak ( compare the dotted to the dashed lines ) .",
    "the quenching of the cross section is large for low momentum transfer ( almost a 50% reduction at the peak for @xmath75 mev / c ) and diminishes with @xmath56 ( below 15% for @xmath77 mev / c ) . on the other hand the fsi produces a further reduction of the rpa results and an important enhancement for high energy transfer",
    "this a consequence of the modification of the nucleon dispersion relation in the medium through the dressed nucleon propagator inside the nucleus .    concerning the polarization observables , we see that the longitudinal component @xmath49 is very close to @xmath78 for the three kinematics , while there is a small but appreciable transverse component ( around @xmath79 ) , quite independent of @xmath56",
    ". the inclusion of the rpa does not change these results .",
    "the reason is that the polarization components are obtained as a ratio between linear combinations of nuclear structure functions and the rpa changes similarly numerator and denominator .",
    "the same can be said for the fsi effects , except for the high-@xmath57 region .",
    "the lfg is unable to contribute to the high energy tail of the cross section , while the model with fsi is able to describe this region where , however , the qe cross section is rather small .",
    "we have generated results for higher values of the muon - neutrino energy corresponding to the kinematics of fig .",
    "2 . however in all the remaining cases the transverse polarization component computed is negligible and the muon can be considered polarized with negative helicity .",
    "an example of the results found for tau leptons is displayed in fig .",
    "5 , where we show the @xmath2 cross section and polarization observables for the same values of @xmath56 as in fig . 4 , but this time for @xmath80 gev . by inspection of fig .",
    "3 we see that for the three values of @xmath56 considered the maximum of the qe lies inside the allowed kinematical region .",
    "the case @xmath75 mev / c is closer to the boundary , since the cross section suddenly ends soon above the maximum , while for higher values of the momentum transfer the allowed region extends to higher energy transfer .",
    "the effects seen here over the cross section due to rpa and fsi are similar to the muon case studied above , with the exception of the missing high energy tail that lies now in the forbidden region .    concerning the polarization components , the longitudinal one is still negative but now is well above @xmath78 . on the other hand",
    ", an appreciable @xmath50 component appears , taking values ranging from @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "thus the magnitude of @xmath50 increases with @xmath56 , and , as in the muon case , the rpa and fsi effects are rather small on the polarization observables .",
    "a more clear scene with similar results can be seen in fig . 6 for @xmath83 gev , corresponding to the kinematics of the third panel in fig .",
    "3 . in this case",
    "the qe peak is well inside the allowed region for the three values of @xmath56 .",
    "the polarization component @xmath49 is now closer to @xmath78 , while the magnitude of @xmath50 is smaller than in the former case .",
    "results for @xmath84 gev ( not shown ) indicate that @xmath49 almost reaches the limit value @xmath85 , while @xmath49 becomes very small for high neutrino energy , as expected .",
    "another kind of plot of interest for ongoing neutrino experiments is shown in fig .  7 for @xmath0 neutrinos with energy of 7 gev .",
    "this time we fix the scattering angle instead of the momentum transfer .",
    "therefore by changing @xmath57 we are always inside the allowed kinematical region , running along some of the curves shown in the second panel of fig .",
    "3 , never crossing the boundary , and the cross section is defined for every value of @xmath57 shown in the plots .",
    "results are shown for small angles , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , in order to reach not too high values of the momentum transfer . for these angles",
    "the maximum of the qe peak is crossed at @xmath88 , and 600 , respectively . except for @xmath89 at the high @xmath57 tail where the @xmath56-values are perhaps too high , and a word of caution is needed since some important relativistic corrections are expected , we can safely trust the results for lower @xmath57-values where @xmath56 is moderately low .",
    "again we can see the important reduction of the cross section due to rpa correlations for low @xmath57 .",
    "the magnitude of this reduction decreases with the scattering angle .",
    "the fsi produces a reduction for low @xmath57 and an increase for high values of the energy transfer .",
    "the polarization component @xmath49 is more or less independent on the angle and takes values between -0.9 and -0.8 . the transverse polarization @xmath50 is zero for @xmath58 by definition , eq .",
    "( 6 ) , while it is not negligible at all for the remaining angles , taking values between @xmath81 and -0.5 . concerning the rpa and fsi corrections on these polarization observables ,",
    "the effect is found to be negligible for low energy .",
    "however at the high energy tail and for @xmath58 the net rpa+fsi effect makes @xmath49 to change from @xmath90 to @xmath91 . a less important , but still appreciable change is found in @xmath50 for @xmath92 . for higher values of the scattering angle",
    "the effect is again negligible .    to end the discussion , in fig .",
    "8 we show another representation of polarization observables , namely , the total polarization , defined as the modulus of the polarization vector @xmath93 and the angle with respect to minus the longitudinal direction ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 the total polarization @xmath96 takes values between 0.8 and 0.9 for @xmath58 and increases with the scattering angle . for @xmath58",
    "the angle @xmath97 is also zero , meaning that the polarization vector points to the @xmath94 direction , without transverse components . in this case",
    "the total polarization has the meaning of fraction of particles with negative helicity .",
    "a value different from unity means that the interaction with the nuclear target produces a small fraction of tau leptons with _",
    "a value close to one means that a large percentage of the leptons exit with the spin pointing to the same direction .",
    "the most probable direction of the lepton spin is determined by the angle @xmath97 . for @xmath92",
    "this angle is between @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and slightly increase for @xmath89 .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "8 are showing a non negligible increase of the total polarization due to rpa+fsi effects , for @xmath58 .",
    "these effects are negligible over this observable for @xmath100 and @xmath101 . on the other hand , for @xmath92 we find an appreciable reduction of the polarization angle @xmath97 due to rpa+fsi , that again is negligible for higher scattering angles .    summarizing this work ,",
    "we have computed the cross section and polarization observables for neutrino induced cc reactions in nuclei at the qe peak .",
    "we have focused this work on the case of @xmath0 leptons of interest for neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the rpa plus fsi nuclear effects have been evaluated for intermediate energy and momentum transfer .",
    "these corrections are essential in the cross section , especially for low energy , but are partially reduced , due to cancellations , on the polarization observables .",
    "however , we have identified some particular kinematics , at very low scattering angles , where these nuclear corrections are of some importance to determine the correct magnitude and angle of the polarization vector .    this work was supported by dgi and feder funds , contract fis2005 - 00810 , by the eu integrated infrastructure initiative hadron physics project contract rii3-ct-2004 - 506078 and by the junta de andaluca .",
