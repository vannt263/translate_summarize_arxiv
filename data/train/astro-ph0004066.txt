    "the gravitational collapse of molecular clouds leading to star formation has long been an active area of study . in the early stages of collapse ( from @xmath11  g  @xmath12 to @xmath13  g  @xmath12 )",
    "the gas remains approximately isothermal ( at temperature @xmath14  k ) due to efficient cooling by dust grains ( see , e.g. , myhill & boss 1993 ) .",
    "the gas dynamics is then specified by two dimensional parameters , the gravitational constant @xmath15 and the isothermal sound speed @xmath16 , so that the flow is expected to approach a self - similar form in the asymptotic limit , when the memory of initial conditions is `` lost '' .",
    "larson ( 1969 ) and penston ( 1969 ) found a similarity solution which describes the pre - collapse ( i.e. , before the central protostar forms ) evolution of the cloud , in which the gas collapses from rest , accelerating until it cruises at mach number of @xmath17 and the density profile reaches a @xmath18 power law .",
    "the larson - penston solution contains a nonsingular homologous inner core and a supersonic outer envelope .",
    "a qualitatively different set of similarity solutions was found by shu ( 1977 ) .",
    "of particular interest is shu s expansion - wave solution which describes the post - collapse accretion of a singular isothermal gas cloud onto a protostar . in this solution ,",
    "the flow starts from hydrostatic equilibrium ( with a @xmath18 density profile ) and a rarefaction wave expands from the center and initiates the collapse ( the so - called `` inside - out '' collapse ) ; inside the expansion - wave front , the flow eventually attains the free - fall behavior ( @xmath19 ) at small radii , with density @xmath20 .",
    "the link between the larson - penston pre - collapse solution and shu s expansion - wave solution was elucidated by hunter ( 1977 ) , who showed that the larson - penston solution can be continued to the post - collapse phase and that there exists an infinite ( but discrete ) number of pre- and post - collapse solutions of a different type ( called `` type i '' ; see  2 ) , among which the expansion - wave solution represents a limiting case .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the properties of different self - similar solutions for the collapse and accretion of isothermal spheres .    with the plethora of possible similarity solutions ,",
    "it is important to know which , if any , of them are actually realized by collapse of isothermal clouds .",
    "one - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations , starting from a regular ( bonner - ebert ) sphere , generally indicate that the collapse resembles the larson - penston similarity form in the asymptotic limit ( hunter 1977 ; foster & chevalier 1993 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the recent finding of hanawa & nakayama ( 1997 ) , who showed that the pre - collapse type i solutions of hunter s ( see fig .  1 )",
    "are strongly unstable against global spherical perturbations , and therefore are unlikely to be realized in astrophysical situations or numerical simulations .",
    "similarity solutions have also been investigated in the context of core - collapse supernovae ( goldreich & weber 1980 ; yahil 1983 ) , where the equation of state of the collapsing iron core can be approximated by that of a polytrope , @xmath0 , where @xmath21 is a constant and @xmath22 .",
    "( in fact , the effective @xmath23 is about @xmath24 from the onset of electron capture to the neutrino trapping density , i.e. , for @xmath25  g  @xmath26  g  @xmath12 ; @xmath23 becomes close to @xmath27 when @xmath28  g  @xmath12 until nuclear density is reached . )",
    "goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) studied the special case of @xmath29 , which provides a good description for the inner homologous core ; they also performed a global perturbation analysis and showed that the inner core is stable against all radial and nonradial perturbations .",
    "yahil ( 1983 ) generalized the goldreich - weber solution to general @xmath1 ; this allows for a proper description of the outer core which collapses supersonically .",
    "since yahil s solution is the same as the larson - penston solution except for different values of @xmath23 , we shall often refer them as larson - penston - yahil solutions in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the similarity solutions described above ( in both star formation and supernova contexts ) assume idealized spherical flows .",
    "a realistic gas cloud , however , contains nonradial ( nonspherical ) perturbations , and it is of interest to understand the behaviors of these perturbations during the collapse / accretion of the cloud . in general , multi - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are needed to follow the evolution of the perturbed flow , especially when the perturbations become nonlinear .",
    "the large dynamical range involved in a collapse makes such simulations particularly challenging ( e.g. , star formation ultimately involves collapse from @xmath11  g  @xmath12 to @xmath30  g  @xmath12 ; even the initial isothermal collapse stage involves seven orders of magnitude increase in densities ; see truelove et al .",
    "1997,1998 and boss 1998 for a discussion on the numerical subtleties ) .",
    "an alternative , complementary approach is to carry out linear stability analysis to determine whether the flow is unstable to the growth of any nonradial perturbations . since the unperturbed flow varies in space and time in a self - similar manner , a global analysis",
    "is needed to study perturbations which vary on similar scales as the unperturbed flow itself .",
    "the stability properties of the flow therefore depend crucially on boundary conditions at different locations of the flow . in this paper",
    "we perform global stability analysis for larson - penston - yahil solutions ( general @xmath23 ) and for shu s expansion - wave solution ( @xmath2 only ) to determine whether these similarity flows contain growing nonradial modes .",
    "while the stability properties of isothermal similarity collapse solutions ( the larson - penston solution and the expansion - wave solution ) are relevant to the formation of binary ( and multiple ) stars ( see  5 ) , the present study stems from our attempts to understand the origin of asymmetric supernovae and pulsar kicks ( goldreich , lai & sahrling 1996 ; see also lai 1999 ) .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that local hydrodynamical instabilities in the collapsed stellar core ( e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "1995 ; janka & mller 1994 ,  1996 ; herant et al .",
    "1994 ) , which can in principle lead to asymmetric matter ejection and/or asymmetric neutrino emission , are not adequate to account for kick velocities @xmath31  km  s@xmath32 ( burrows & hayes 1996 ; janka 1998 ) .",
    "global asymmetric perturbations of presupernova cores may be required to produce the observed kicks .",
    "goldreich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that overstable g - modes driven by shell nuclear burning may provide seed perturbations which could be amplified during core collapse ( see also lai & goldreich 2000 ) .",
    "while the analysis of goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) shows that the inner homologous core is stable against nonradial perturbations , the situation is not so clear for the supersonically collapsing outer core where pressure plays a less important role .",
    "it is therefore important to analyse the global stability of yahil s self - similar solution .",
    "hanawa & matsumoto ( 1999 ) have recently found a globally unstable bar mode in the pre - collapse larson - penston solution ( for isothermal collapse ) .",
    "our independent calculations confirm their result for @xmath2 .",
    "since the analysis of hanawa & matsumoto is restricted to perturbations with real eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ( see  3 ) , it is not clear whether there exists any other growing modes , nor is it clear whether the growing bar - mode persists for general values of @xmath23 ( see also hanawa & matsumoto 2000a ) .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 summarizes the basic properties of the ( unperturbed ) larson - penston - yahil similarity solution .",
    "this serves as a preparation for our stability analysis presented in section 3 .",
    "( for readers not interested in technical details , the main results are given in  3.4 and figures 3 - 5 . ) in section 4 we show that shu s expansion - wave solution for isothermal collapse is unstable to nonradial perturbations of all angular orders .",
    "finally , we discuss the astrophysical implications of our results in  5 .",
    "appendix a contains a discussion of the rotational and vortex modes of larson - penston - yahil solutions .",
    "here we briefly review the ( pre - collapse ) larson - penston - yahil similarity solutions for spherical collapse and summarize the basic flow properties which are needed for our perturbation analysis (  3 ) .",
    "we adopt a barotropic equation of state , where pressure @xmath33 and density @xmath34 are related by @xmath0 , and @xmath21 and @xmath23 are constants . to have gravitational collapse we require @xmath1 .",
    "the two dimensional parameters of the problem are @xmath21 and the newton s constant @xmath15 , from which we can construct a unique similarity variable = rr(t),r(t)=k^1/2g^(1-)/2(-t)^(2- ) , where @xmath35 is the spherical radius , and the time @xmath36 is measured from the epoch of core formation ( i.e. , the center formally collapses to a singularity at @xmath37 ) .",
    "our analysis in  3 will be restricted to the pre - collapse solutions , so the domain of interest corresponds to @xmath38 . from dimensional consideration , we can write the dynamical ( dependent ) variables of the flow in self - similar forms : & ( r , t)=_t d ( ) , & _ t = g^-1(-t)^-2[rhot ] + & v(r , t)=v_tv ( ) , & v_t = k^1/2g^(1-)/2(-t)^1- + & p(r , t)=p_tp ( ) , & p_t = kg^-(-t)^-2 + & ( r , t)=_t ( ) , & _",

[ bcinfty]the physical solution is obtained by adjusting @xmath57 so that the flow passes through the sonic point smoothly . to obtain accurate transonic solution , it is useful to analyse the behavior of the flow near the sonic point .",

    "thus the growth rates of the instabilities are unknown at present .",
    "early studies by hunter ( 1962 ) and by lin , mestel & shu ( 1965 ) demonstrated that uniform , pressure - free gas clouds undergoing gravitational collapse are unstable toward fragmentation and shape deformation , with perturbations growing asymptotically as @xmath195 in the linear regime , where @xmath7 denotes the epoch of complete collapse , and @xmath196 is the unperturbed uniform density",
    ". however , the presence of even a small initial central concentration and pressure forces significantly alters the evolution of the cloud . if the gas pressure is simply related to the density by a power - law , @xmath0 ( polytropic equation of state ) , the flow asymptotically approaches the similarity solutions found by larson ( 1969 ) , penston ( 1969 ) ( for isothermal gas @xmath2 ) , by goldreich & weber ( 1980 ) ( for @xmath29 ) , and by yahil ( 1983 ) ( for general @xmath23 ) . since the local jeans length is of the same order as the length scale at which the flow varies , a global analysis is needed to determine the stability properties of the collapsing cloud . the result (  3 ) presented in this paper",
    "( see also hanawa & matsumoto 1999 ) shows that for sufficiently soft equation of state ( @xmath4 ) , the larson - penston - yahil similarity flow is unstable against bar - mode perturbations , such that @xmath197 with @xmath198 ( @xmath124 for @xmath2 and @xmath80 increases to zero as @xmath23 increases to @xmath199 , see fig .",
    "5 ) , where @xmath7 denotes the epoch of core formation . since the central density increases as @xmath200 ,",
    "the growth of perturbation , @xmath201 , is slow ( e.g. , for isothermal collapse , @xmath202 increases by a factor of @xmath203 when @xmath204 increases by a factor of @xmath205 ) . such a slow growth ( compared with the @xmath206 behavior for the collapse of uniform , pressure - less gas )",
    "is a result of the stablizing influence of pressure , despite the large mach number ( about @xmath207 ) achieved in the outer region of the cloud .",
    "our stability analysis applies to the pre - collapse stage ( prior to core formation ) of the larson - penston - yahil solutions .",
    "after the central core forms , the outer core and envelope accrete onto it ( see fig .  1 )",
    ". the gas approaches free - fall as @xmath208 , and the mach number becomes much greater than unity . in this ( accretion ) stage , nonradial perturbations ( of all scales ) grow kinematically as @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the radius of a fluid element and @xmath211 its comoving density ( lai & goldreich 2000 ) .",
    "although the fluid element is free - falling , the perturbation grows more slowly compared with the case of uniform pressure - less collapse because the steep velocity gradients provide a stablizing influence on the flow .    the global bar - mode instability for isothermal collapse may have important implications for star formation , particularly in connection with the formation of binary ( and multiple ) stars ( see also hanawa & matsumoto 1999 ; matsumoto & hanawa 1999 ) .",
    "fragmentation is unlikely to occur in a globally spherical collapse because small condensations do not contract fast enough to separate out from the converging bulk flow .",
    "angular momentum ( or magnetic field ) can obviously make the cloud nonspherical , and thus facilitate fragmentation ( e.g. , burkert & bodenheimer 1996 ; burkert , bate & bodenheimer 1997 ; truelove et al .",
    "1997,1998 ; boss 1998 ) .",
    "observations suggest that many of the molecular cloud cores ( with mass of order a few @xmath212 and size @xmath213  pc ) have elongated shapes ( myers et al .",
    "1991 ) and slow rotation rates ( with the ratio of rotational to gravitational energies of order @xmath214 ; goodman et al .",
    "1993 ) , implying that rotation is probably not a crucial factor in driving fragmentation on scales greater than @xmath215  au .",
    "our result on the growth of bar - mode perturbations ( @xmath216 ) indicates that , even without net angular momentum , the collapsing cloud tends to deform into an ellipsoidal shape ( oblate disk or prolate bar , depending on which @xmath217-mode perturbation is dominant initially ) .",
    "fragmentation is more likely to occur for such deformed configurations ( e.g. , bonnel 1999 ; matsumoto & hanawa 1999 ) .    in the context of core - collapse supernovae",
    ", our result shows that the homologous inner core and the supersonic outer core are globally stable against nonradial perturbations prior to core bounce at nuclear density and the formation of the proto - neutron star .",
    "however , during the subsequent accretion of the outer core ( involving @xmath218 of the core mass ) and envelope onto the proto - neutron star , nonspherical perturbations can grow according to @xmath219 or even @xmath220 ( lai & goldreich 2000 ) .",
    "the asymmetric density perturbations seeded in the presupernova star , especially those in the outer region of the iron core , are therefore amplified during collapse .",
    "the enhanced asymmetric density perturbation may lead to asymmetric shock propagation and breakout , which then give rise to asymmetry in the explosion and a kick velocity to the neutron star ( goldreich et al .",
    "1996 ; burrows & hayes 1996 ) .",
    "our stability analysis (  4 ) shows that shu s expansion - wave solution is globally unstable to perturbations of all @xmath10 s , although the growth rates are unknown at present .",
    "the implication of this result is not entirely clear .",
    "it is well - known that a static singular isothermal sphere is highly unstable to radial perturbations ( a truncated bonner - ebert isothermal sphere is unstable when the range of density from the center to the surface is greater than @xmath221 ; see bonner 1956 , hunter 1977 ) .",
    "earlier one - dimensional numerical simulations have already shown that a collapsing isothermal cloud does not approach the expansion - wave solution ( hunter 1977 ; foster & chevalier 1993 ) .",
    "our stability analysis corroborates this result , and indicates that the expansion - wave solution can not be realised in a pure hydrodynamical situation .",
    "magnetic fields play an important role in the current paradigm for forming low - mass stars ( e.g. , shu , adams & lizano 1987 ; shu et al .",
    "1999 ; mouschovias & ciolek 1999 ) .",
    "ambipolar diffusion of magnetic fields drives the quasi - static contraction of the molecular cloud core with growing central concentration such that the core asymptotically approaches the state of a singular isothermal sphere . when the flux - to - mass ratio drops below certain critical value , a runaway `` inside - out '' collapse ensues , and it is thought that this collapse is well described by the expansion - wave solution ( shu et al .",
    "1999 ) . in reality",
    ", there is probably no sharp distinction between the quasi - static contraction and dynamical collapse ( e.g. , safier , mckee & stahler 1997 ; li 1998 ) , and a real singular isothermal sphere can never be reached .",
    "our global stability analysis of the expansion - wave solution (  4 ) does not depend on the mathematical singularity of the solution at @xmath222 , but depends on the existence of a well - defined rarefaction front and a static isothermal density profile outside the front in the solution .",
    "it in not clear whether our idealized hydrodynamical stability analysis can be applied to more realistic situations with ( even sub - dominant ) magnetic fields ( see galli & shu 1993a , b and li & shu 1997 for the effects of magnetic field on self - similar `` inside - out '' collapse ) .",
