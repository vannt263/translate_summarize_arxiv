    "the resistivity of a normal metal ( n ) on distance scales greater than the mean free path @xmath4 is characterized by drude theory . because the drude model is based on the diffusive motion of electrons , the resistance scales with material or probe geometry . on length scales shorter than @xmath4 ,",
    "electrons move ballistically and the resistance is not so simply related to the geometry . this ballistic regime , which is becoming increasingly relevant with the miniaturization of electronic devices , can be accessed by tunneling into a material from a contact of size @xmath5 . in such contacts , rich spectroscopic information may be obtained from measurements of differential conductance ( @xmath6 ) or its derivative ( @xmath7 ) with respect to applied voltage .",
    "for example , in a normal - normal junction (",
    "n / n ) , a measurement of the conductance derivative yields information about the spectral weight of interactions , which are typically electron - phonon in nature.@xcite    new phenomena occur when the point - contact is between a normal metal and a superconductor ( n / s ) .",
    "for example , if there is no barrier between the two metals , the current through the junction increases by a factor of two below a certain energy @xmath8 .",
    "this energy is associated with the formation of cooper pairs in the superconductor . on the other hand , for a large barrier the current through",
    "the junction goes to zero for energies less than @xmath8 .",
    "point - contact spectroscopy of n / s junctions has been predominantly used to measure the energy gap and associated density of states . using this information , lower bounds on the fermi velocity and coherence length ( the spatial size of a cooper pair ) of the superconductor",
    "can be obtained .",
    "measurements on superconductors to obtain such information have been performed on materials such as niobium ( nb),@xcite cuprates,@xcite @xmath9,@xcite @xmath10,@xcite and heavy fermion materials.@xcite in this paper , we present an experiment , suitable for an advanced undergraduate laboratory , to study the n / s spectroscopic behavior of a point - contact between a gold ( au ) tip and nb film ( see fig .  [ lunafig01 ] ) .        in order to understand how reflection and transmission occur at the interface between a normal metal and a superconductor , it is important to understand some basic facts about superconductivity . at the transition temperature of a superconductor @xmath11",
    ", the resistance drops to zero and an energy gap @xmath12 ev , opens up in the density of states . as explained by bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory,@xcite this energy gap  also known as the pair - potential energy or binding energy  arises because it is thermodynamically more favorable for electrons of opposite spin to bind together into a spin - zero boson called a `` cooper pair . ''",
    "hence at @xmath13 , when there are no thermal fluctuations , the electrons will exist only in cooper pairs",
    ".    in n / s point - contact transport measurements , three major processes occur at the interface : ( 1 ) transmission , ( 2 ) reflection , and ( 3 ) andreev reflection .",
    "all can occur to varying degrees , although differences in the size of the junction and the tunneling barrier can alter the probabilities for any given event to occur .",
    "the  height \" of the barrier at the n / s interface can be characterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath14 ; a low barrier that is easy to cross corresponds to @xmath15 while a high barrier that inhibits current is characterized by @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting differential conductance @xmath17 for high and low barriers at @xmath13 is shown in fig .",

    "let us now return to a description of the three processes mentioned above . for energies above the gap ( @xmath18 ) ,",
    "cooper pairs break and form single particle states in the superconductor .",
    "such states are called `` quasiparticles '' because a particle and its influence on the local environment move together as a single particle - like entity . in this energy regime , process ( 1 ) transmission occurs . here",
    ", single electrons are transmitted into the superconductor and manifests itself as a linear @xmath19-@xmath20 curve ( constant differential conductance ) .    for energies below the gap ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "the differential conductance depends on the constriction and tunneling barrier . in the case of a large constriction where transport is not in the ballistic regime , process ( 2 )",
    "reflection occurs independent of whether the tunneling barrier @xmath14 is small or large . in this case",
    "a single particle fermion can not be transmitted into the superconductor which is composed of two - particle bosonic states .",
    "the electrons from the normal metal therefore reflect from the interface of the superconductor and hence the current and @xmath6 are zero for this energy regime .",
    "right at the gap energy @xmath8 , there is a discontinuity in the @xmath19-@xmath20 curve that gives rise to a peak in @xmath6 .",
    "the width of this peak is temperature dependent as broadening can occur due to thermal fluctuations that destroy the cooper pairs .",
    "if the constriction is small enough to be in the ballistic regime , then for a small tunneling barrier with @xmath21 , process ( 3 ) andreev reflection occurs and the differential conductance increases by a factor of two from the conductance above the gap ( see fig .  [",
    "lunafig02]a ) .",
    "physically , this process can be characterized as shown in fig .",
    "[ lunafig03 ] , where in order for a spin - up electron that is injected with energy @xmath21 to be trasmitted , it must form a cooper pair with an electron of opposite spin in the superconductor . consequently , a hole  a mathematical construction to describe the absence of an electron  is reflected back with opposite spin and momentum of the incident electron .",

    "there are several important points to make regarding the form of @xmath54 .",
    "firstly , there are four distinct wave numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the reason to distinguish between @xmath57 s and @xmath58 s is because the inclusion of @xmath38 alters the dispersion relation @xmath59 inside of the superconductor .",

    "secondly , inside the superconductor the waves are no longer pure electrons and holes but instead a combination of both  they are _",
    "quasiparticles_. because the hamiltonian is no longer a diagonal matrix in the electron - hole basis , its eigenvectors will have two non - zero components . for any given energy there are two quasiparticle states and we denote the one with a positive ( negative ) group velocity by @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) . finally , a reflected hole propagates with a wave number of @xmath64 and",
    "not @xmath65 . because a hole is the absence of a particle , differentiating the dispersion relation gives a group velocity with the opposite sign .",
    "one of the quasiparticles will propagate forward with a wave number of @xmath66 for the exact same reason ( see fig .",
    "11.7 of ref . for a nice picture of this dispersion relation ) .",
    "the boundary conditions for this problem are continuity of the wave function @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and a discontinuity in the slope of the wave function across the @xmath29-function @xmath70 using these conditions , we can derive the relations @xmath71 and @xmath72 we can solve for @xmath73 and @xmath74 from eq .   if we approximate @xmath75 ( or equivalently @xmath76 ) . because we are dealing with energies of only a few mev whereas a typical ( normal ) metal has a fermi energy of 110 ev , this is a reasonable approximation for any normal metal ( see table 2.1 of ref . ) .",
    "we then obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 using these results , we can calculate the probabilities of andreev reflection @xmath79 and normal reflection @xmath80 .",
    "lastly , because nb and au have different fermi velocities , we must use an effective @xmath81 that satisfies @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the ratio of the fermi velocities in the normal and superconducting metals.@xcite by using @xmath81 we are able to place a lower bound on the fermi velocity of the superconductor .",
    "we now derive the differential conductance of a n / s tunnel junction from first principles without andreev reflections and show how it is related to the density of states of the superconductor",
    ". we will then incorporate andreev reflection using the btk model , and show how to estimate the energy gap and place a lower bound on the fermi velocity and bcs coherence length .",

    "note that @xmath98 is a bell - shaped weighting function with a maxinum at @xmath99 , a width of @xmath100 , and unit area .",
    "this factor plays the same mathematical role as a dirac delta function inside an integral when @xmath101 . at zero temperature ,",
    "the differential conductance approaches the density of states of the superconductor @xmath102 which is equivalent to what is shown in fig .",
    "[ lunafig02]b for large @xmath14 .",
    "if we use the btk formulation to incorporate andreev reflections , the current that flows across the junction is @xmath103 in this equation , @xmath104 represents that transmission coefficient for electrical current .",
    "this coefficient incorporates the fact that when a hole is reflected , a positive charge moves in the opposite direction as the incident electron .",
    "such a current is represented by @xmath105 and will add to the incident current .",
    "similarly , reflected electrons are represented by @xmath106 and will reduce the current . although the current obtained in eq .",
    "( [ ins ] ) using the btk approach is similar to eq .",
    "( [ itransfer ] ) , it is different in the fact that the normal metal and superconductor are not decoupled and the initial wave packet evolves continuously through the barrier ( see section v of ref . ) .",
    "however , the first approach is important from a pedagogical standpoint , as it is easy to interpret the relationship between the tunneling current and the density of states of the superconductor .",
    "using the current in eq .",
    "( [ ins ] ) , the differential conductance of a s / n junction at low temperature is approximately given by the transmission coefficient for electrical current @xmath107 this conductance is also related to the density of states of the superconductor , but the relationship is harder to discern because the density of states is encoded in the coherence factors @xmath108 .",
    "a benefit to this btk formulation is that the barrier height is not assumed to be large so that andreev reflection processes come into consideration , whereas it is absent in the formulation given by the current in eq .",

    "if @xmath114 , the contact is ballistic which prevents heating effects at large current densities at voltages on the order of the gap energy . the resistance in this regime , known as the sharvin resistance , @xmath115 , is due to the radius of the constriction from the normal metal to the superconductor .",
    "furthermore , the size of the contact must be much less than the coherence length ( @xmath116 ) to suppress the proximity effect , where the tip of the gold begins to weakly superconduct and the niobium becomes an imperfect superconductor .",

    "we performed point - contact spectroscopy to measure the differential conductance as a function of bias - voltage through a au / nb junction .",
    "we then estimated the superconducting gap , quasiparticle lifetime , and placed a lower bound on the fermi velocity and bcs coherence length in nb by fitting the experimental data to theoretical curves predicted by the btk model .",
    "one of the largest drawbacks to this setup is the amount of time required to cool down a glass dewar cryostat before data can be acquired .",
    "in addition , we only obtained approximately ten reasonable sets of data before a dip in the differential conductance appeared around @xmath144  mv .",
    "as discussed above , this signifies a curled tip with large contact area that negates the underlying assumptions of the btk model .",
    "unfortunately , at this point a new tip can not be easily replaced mid - experiment because the cryostat must be warmed up to remove the tip .",
    "furthermore , there were concerns about the possibility of the probe freezing due to thermal contraction of the cylindrical rods .",
    "such contraction would trap helium between the rods and render the probe immovable .",
    "although such concerns were never realized in practice , this possibility could be eliminated by cutting a small slit in the outer rod to allow helium to escape .",
    "this experiment easily extends to measure other superconducting materials or different types of junctions , such as a superconductor - superconductor junction . plus , the introduction of a magnetic field into the apparatus would allow for measurement of tunneling processes from a normal metal to a ferromagnet .",
    "one improvement would be to measure incremental changes on the differential screw to provide quantitative data of the pressure between the tip and the sample .",
    "the present experiment can be simplified by using a block of nb rather than a thin film .",
    "films are easier to insulate and were readily available to us , but a nb block can be placed on a glass slide and wires attached with silver epoxy . a superconducting sample can also be purchased from industry . if one obtained a high-@xmath11 sample ( e.g. yba@xmath145cu@xmath146o@xmath147 ) , a simple setup can be constructed to immerse the sample into a liquid nitrogen container .",
    "if liquid helium is required , one can reconfigure the apparatus described previously to fit inside of a storage dewar . because the height at which the dipping probe is inserted into the storage dewar stabilizes to a fixed temperature",
    ", such a setup would allow measurement of the differential conductance as a function of temperature .",
    "hence the transition of the differential conductance when the sample is above @xmath11 to below @xmath11 can be observed .",
    "we would like to thank karlheinz merkle and the stanford physics machine shop for machining much of our apparatus , weigang wang for his electronics expertise , robert hammond for making our nb thin film , rick pam for maintaining the laboratory , and david goldhaber - gordon , malcolm beasley , and alexander fetter for helpful discussions .",
