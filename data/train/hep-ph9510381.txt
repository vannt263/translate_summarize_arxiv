    "the recent precise measurement of the magnetic moment of @xmath2 , @xmath4  @xmath5@xcite , gives new possibilities for theoretical studies of the magnetic moments of the decuplet baryons .",
    "these magnetic moments constitute an important domain for investigating baryon structure and have earlier been studied _",
    "e.g. _ in quenched lattice gauge theory@xcite , quark models@xcite , the chiral bag model@xcite and chiral perturbation theory@xcite .    in an earlier paper@xcite we introduced a general parameterization of the baryon magnetic moments in order to account for necessary modifications of the non - relativistic quark model ( nqm ) description . in this paper",
    "we extend this parameterization to the @xmath0 resonance particles in the decuplet .",
    "although only two of the magnetic moments of these states have been measured , it is still in principle possible to obtain interesting information on the spin structure of the resonance particles from these data .",
    "we analyze the magnetic moments of the spin @xmath6 particles in this model and make predictions for the magnetic moments of the resonance particles using values for the quark magnetic moments extrapolated from the nucleon - hyperon data in our previous analysis .",
    "the magnetic moment of a hadron in isomultiplet @xmath7 can , in the quark model , be written as a linear sum of contributions from the various flavors @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an effective magnetic moment of the quark of flavor @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the corresponding spin polarization for baryon @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the baryon charge state . by symmetry arguments",
    "the @xmath11 s in the octet baryons can be expressed as constant linear combinations of the three @xmath14 s for the proton , which are the only spin polarizations needed to describe the octet : @xmath15 where @xmath16 runs over @xmath17 , and the @xmath18 s are matrices with constant elements . in particular , for the six mirror symmetric baryons of type @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are different flavors , we have @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where the flavor @xmath25 is the non - valence quark flavor . in the nqm",
    "the values of these spin polarizations are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28    in the model we consider in ref.@xcite , we let the quark magnetic moments be different in different baryon isomultiplets , but the same within each isospin multiplet@xcite . when the quark magnetic moments are taken to be the same in all isomultiplets , the baryon magnetic moments are connected by sum - rules .",
    "these sum - rules are clearly violated by the experimental data indicating that the quark magnetic moments are not the same in different isomultiplets .",
    "lattice calculations@xcite also indicate that they are different in different baryons .",
    "thus , the quark magnetic moments will be denoted by @xmath29 , where @xmath10 is the quark flavor and @xmath7 is the baryon isomultiplet .",
    "the spin structure variables in the magnetic moments are not a priori the same as in deep inelastic scattering experiments and axial - vector form factors . however , in many models@xcite they are proportional to these spin polarizations . since the equations for the magnetic moments are homogeneous in the quark magnetic moments and the spin polarizations , the quark magnetic moments can be deduced from experimental data by normalizing the spin polarizations with the value of the weak axial - vector form factor @xmath30@xcite .",
    "the spin polarizations we deduce will then be the relevant ones for the spin as measured in deep inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "later we will use data of the quark magnetic moments from the octet baryons , and these are normalized in this way .    in the decuplet",
    "there are four different isomultiplets and thus there are in principle twelve quark magnetic moments .",
    "we introduce the flavor breaking parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 describing the flavor breaking among the quarks , which is assumed to be the same for all isomultiplets .",
    "thus @xmath33 and @xmath34 independently of @xmath7 .",
    "in what follows we will assume that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the same for both the octet and decuplet baryons . and @xmath32 are @xmath35 when the three quark magnetic moments are allowed to be free parameters . ]",
    "this assumption can in principle be tested when more data of the decuplet magnetic moments is available .",
    "there are therefore six parameters for the twelve quark magnetic moments .    in each baryon",
    "there are also spin structure variables . in the octet",
    "there are three different ones , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , defined as the spin polarization of the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 quarks in the proton in the spin up state .",
    "however , in the decuplet it turns out that there are only two different spin polarization parameters , denoted @xmath41 and @xmath37 .",
    "these are both defined for the @xmath1 resonance in the @xmath42 state and are normalized for convenience of notation with a factor of three , so that @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath44 are the quark spin polarizations in @xmath1 of the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 quarks respectively .",
    "the reason for there being only two different spin polarization parameters in the decuplet is that the spin structure there is much simpler than in the octet due to the flavor functions being fully symmetric , which does not allow mixed symmetry for the spins .    in the nqm",
    "the spin polarization parameters have for the decuplet the values @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in a more sophisticated model , due to virtual quark antiquark pairs , gluonic corrections ,",
    "spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , emission and capture of goldstone bosons etc .",
    "they might have more general values .",
    "su(3 ) relations are used to construct the spin structure of the states .",
    "the flavor breaking is assumed to occur in the quark magnetic moment operators by the effective masses and possible vertex corrections .",
    "the magnetic moments of the decuplet particles can then be written :    @xmath47    combining the equations ( [ tank],[sa],[kul],[vi],[har ] and [ hurra ] ) we get the system of equations    [ egenekv ] @xmath48    where @xmath49    the set of equations ( [ egenekv ] ) constitutes an over - determined system .",
    "we therefore get two different equations from the conditions that the secular determinant of either ( [ egen1])+([egen2 ] ) or ( [ egen2])+([egen3 ] ) should vanish . both of these contain the root @xmath50 , which we discard .",
    "the other roots are @xmath51    a similar analysis for the octet baryons gives the relation@xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53  @xmath5 , and @xmath54 our assumption that the symmetry breaking is the same in the decuplet as in the octet predicts the sum - rules @xmath55    in the present case there are two more baryons than in the nucleon - hyperon case and one spin polarization less .",
    "it might therefore seem possible to get the spin structure directly from the magnetic moment data .",
    "however , as we mentioned above , the equations are homogeneous in the quark moments and the spin polarizations .",
    "we therefore still lack a normalization for the spin polarizations .",
    "hence , the set of equations above can only determine the relative magnitude of the spin polarizations and quark magnetic moments .",
    "also the magnetic moment of @xmath2 can not be given in the model , since the value of @xmath56 is a free parameter .",
    "we therefore have nine data with seven parameters , constituting an over - constrained system , giving the possibility of a non - trivial test of the model .    for example using only the @xmath57-resonances we can solve for the spin polarization in terms of @xmath58 .",
    "the relevant formulas are @xmath59 , \\\\",
    "3\\delta s & = &           \\frac{1}{\\mu_{d}^{\\delta}(t-1)(t+u+1 ) }           [ -(t+2)\\mu(\\delta^{+})+(2t+1)\\mu(\\delta^{0})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the total spin polarization , @xmath3 , is given by the sum of the coefficients of the quark magnetic moments , _",
    "i.e. _ in our model of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this gives for all 3/2 baryons @xmath63 .",
    "thus @xmath64 .\\ ] ] however , we can also express the spin sum in terms of two other of these moments as @xmath65.\\ ] ] we will not pursue this line further here , since there is at present not enough data to test these relations .",
    "lacking most of the data to carry out an analysis , we will from now on instead work to predict the magnetic moments of the @xmath6 resonances using data from the nucleon - hyperon system",
    ". we will then also be able to obtain the quark spin polarizations of the spin @xmath6 resonances .",
    "as we mentioned above , the flavor symmetry breaking is assumed to be the same for the decuplet as for the octet .",
    "this assumption can in the future be tested in the way indicated above , by determining the constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the magnetic moments in the decuplet .    from the measured magnetic moments of the octet baryons",
    "we can calculate the @xmath60 s , once the spin polarizations are known . since the value of @xmath66 for the octet ( the nucleons ) is still not too well determined , and does not give too precise a determination of @xmath31 , we will take two typical cases , one consistent with the most recent data , and for the other we take @xmath67 corresponding to no isospin symmetry breaking",
    ". new evaluations of @xmath66 for the nucleons give different , although overlapping values . a recent determination by smc@xcite gives @xmath68 , whereas ellis and karliner@xcite have analyzed data to get @xmath69 .",
    "the values we will use are @xmath70 corresponding to @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath67 ( no isospin symmetry breaking ) . the formulas used to extract the @xmath60 s are@xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath7 and @xmath76 are given by ( [ a][c ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ vacker_linje ] the ratios @xmath77 are plotted as a function of the mean mass of @xmath7 .",
    "we see that they can be well fitted by a linear function , and we therefore extrapolate this function out to @xmath2 and use the ensuing data set for the @xmath60 s , where the intermediate values are interpolated from this graph .",
    "these values are given in table [ tabell1 ] .",
    "we will analyze this linear relation among the @xmath78 s in section  [ snackmotslutet ] .    with the parameters of table [ tabell1 ] we can now determine the quark spin polarizations in the decuplet from the measured magnetic moments of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and use this to predict the other magnetic moments .",
    "the result is    @xmath79    inserting the experimental values given in table [ tabell2 ] gives @xmath80 for @xmath67 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "the result indicates that the decuplet spin polarization with the present data taken at face value is large and negative .",
    "however , the error on the magnetic moment of @xmath1 is rather large and the value might according to ref.@xcite be anywhere between @xmath83 and @xmath84  @xmath5 .",
    "we have therefore instead plotted the value of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath85 in fig .",
    "[ tjusig_kurva ] . from this",
    "we see that @xmath3 passes zero at around @xmath86  @xmath5 independently of the value of @xmath31 . only at @xmath87",
    "@xmath5 does @xmath88 reach the nqm value of @xmath89 when @xmath67 . for",
    "@xmath90 @xmath88 reaches the value 3 at @xmath91  @xmath5 .",
    "we clearly need a better measurement of @xmath85 to truly fix the value of @xmath3 , but in face of existing data we feel confident to say that @xmath88 is much smaller than the nqm value of @xmath89 , in analogy to the situation for the nucleon spin .",
    "for completeness we have included a prediction of the magnetic moments of the decuplet assuming that @xmath92  @xmath5 , corresponding to @xmath93 , in table [ tabell2 ] .",
    "this value also gives @xmath94 and @xmath95 , when @xmath67 , which looks more realistic .    using ( [ delta - u ] ) and ( [ delta - s ] ) the magnetic moments of the decuplet particles can be predicted .",
    "the values are given in table [ tabell2 ] .",
    "we first remark that these values are independent of @xmath31 . to see this",
    "let us introduce the combinations @xmath96 and @xmath97 in terms of these two numbers we can construct all other magnetic moments as linear combinations of them .",
    "we have    @xmath98    where @xmath99 .",
    "we have here used the relation ( [ ut - relation ] ) between @xmath32 and @xmath31 . since the ratios between the @xmath78 s are independent of @xmath31 , the baryon magnetic moments also are .",
    "the ratios between the @xmath78 s within the decuplet found from the linear fit resembles very much those found in lattice gauge theory calculations@xcite .",
    "the magnetic moments differ notably from those of the nqm , mainly because of the low experimental value of @xmath85 .",
    "but we also note that the recent precise measurement of @xmath100  @xmath5@xcite is off from the nqm value",
    "@xmath101  @xmath5 by several standard deviations .",
    "here we will study the linear relation among the @xmath78 s that we found when analyzing the octet data in the model .",
    "we first remark that the quark magnetic moments obtained with this model are really only effective moments , as was already mentioned in the introduction .    in the quark model the magnetic moment of a quark",
    "is of the form @xmath103 @xmath104 being the quark charge .",
    "the dependence on @xmath7 could then be due to a variation of the effective quark mass @xmath105 on @xmath7 .",
    "a model of this kind has been considered by chao@xcite .",
    "another interpretation is suggested by a further study of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "let us introduce the ratio @xmath106 which as a function of the mean mass of @xmath7 is plotted in fig .  [ vacker_linje ] .",
    "with this function we can now rewrite equation ( 1 ) as follows : @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "since the @xmath110 s are independent of @xmath10 we can take them outside the sum to get @xmath111    this equation suggests that the magnetic moments of heavier states for some reason decrease with increasing mass relative to the values expected from the nucleon data .",
    "this might take place through collective effects that increase with mass , _",
    "e.g. _ the moment of inertia , and/or gluonic collective effects etc .",
    "one example of this could be skyrmion collective effects , like in the chiral bag model@xcite .",
    "finally a third way of interpreting the result is also possible .    in our analysis",
    "the @xmath14 s are kept constant and the same in the whole octet .",
    "we then get @xmath7-dependent @xmath102 s in the form @xmath112 however , we also note that by a slight reinterpretation of our model we could associate the @xmath110-factor instead with the @xmath14 s . in this case",
    "the quark magnetic moments would be fixed throughout and the spin polarizations would be varying linearly with the mass of @xmath7 in the form @xmath113 for each flavor @xmath10 .",
    "since the baryon masses are well accounted for by mass formulas with the same quark masses in both the octet and the decuplet , equation ( [ next ] ) suggests that the quark magnetic moments might also be constant in the two supermultiplets .",
    "this last interpretation is therefore not unreasonable .",
    "our empirically found mass dependence of the @xmath60 s would then be induced by us keeping the @xmath14 s fixed in the analysis .",
    "clearly , as long as it comes to analyzing only the baryon magnetic moments , these different interpretations of equation ( [ bbb ] ) are equivalent , and all relations between magnetic moments will be the same in the three interpretations .    in the last interpretation , however ,",
    "the quark spin polarizations would decrease with increasing isomultiplet mass .",
    "thus @xmath114 for nucleons will decrease to @xmath115 for the @xmath116-particles .",
    "also the spin polarizations as well as @xmath3 should be renormalized from the value presented here by a factor @xmath110 for the @xmath117 resonances , since we have normalized the spin polarization relative to the nucleons .",
    "this means in particular that @xmath3 for the @xmath57-resonances should instead have the value @xmath118 for @xmath67 .",
    "these questions could be illuminated if we could measure the spin polarizations in the spin @xmath6 resonances .",
    "in all interpretations we have assumed that @xmath110 is valid for both the octet and decuplet .",
    "this implies that the magnetic moments of the baryons are predicted to be vanishingly small as @xmath110 goes to zero as a function of the mass @xmath119 of @xmath7 .",
    "this happens at @xmath120 gev if the linear relation is still valid in this region . at any rate it is clearly highly interesting to try to measure magnetic moments of very massive baryon states and to study them with lattice calculations .",
    "further studies of the last interpretation will be presented elsewhere@xcite .    in any case we can test the linear relation among the quark magnetic moment ratios by the value of @xmath56 obtained from a fit to say @xmath121 once the values of @xmath41 and @xmath37 are given from any other two magnetic moments measured in the future .",
    "we have studied the magnetic moments of the spin @xmath6 resonances in a model allowing a general parameterization of flavor symmetry breaking and arbitrary quark spin polarizations . as we saw in an earlier analysis of the octet magnetic moments ,",
    "the flavor breaking is small when the quark spin of the nucleon is small . at face value of the measured magnetic moments ,",
    "the isospin symmetric case @xmath67 suggests a negative quark spin content in the @xmath6 resonances of the order of @xmath122 as compared to the nqm value of @xmath89 .",
    "however , the experimental data is still not good enough to give a precise determination .    using the two measured magnetic moments we predict the magnetic moments of the other @xmath6 resonances independently of the symmetry breaking .",
    "they are quite different from the quark model ones ( as are already the measured values of @xmath85 and @xmath121 ) , and could , when measured , be used as a probe to study the consistency of the model . in fact , already three experimental data is enough to test most of the assumptions made in our model .",
    "we also find that the quark magnetic moment ratios in our analysis decrease linearly with mass of the host particle and discuss various interpretations of this effect .",
    "it would be very interesting to try to measure magnetic moments of very massive baryon states and to study them with lattice calculations , to see how far this linear dependence holds .",
