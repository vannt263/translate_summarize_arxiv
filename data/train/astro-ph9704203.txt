    "if extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmfs ) exist , they are at a level below detectability with presently available techniques .",
    "faraday rotation measures of distant powerful radio - sources give upper limits to extragalactic fields of @xmath1gmpc@xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the reversal length of the field ( see , _ e.g. _ , kronberg 1994 ) .",
    "however , egmfs below these current limits are of significant interest to cosmology , galaxy and star formation , and galactic dynamos ( see , _ e.g. _ , kronberg 1994 ; olinto 1997 ) .",
    "the propagation of uhecrs is affected by the presence of egmfs of strength @xmath4 and/or by galactic halo fields @xmath5 .",
    "protogalactic fields in the former range are actually expected if the galactic magnetic field can not be explained by a galactic dynamo ( kulsrud & anderson 1992 ) . in this letter , we study how egmfs and the halo magnetic field , which we collectively name large - scale magnetic fields ( lsmfs ) , affect uhecrs with energies @xmath6 ( eev = @xmath7 ev ) .",
    "we simulate the propagation of ultra - high energy nucleons in the lsmf and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and show how the resulting angle - time - energy images of these uhecrs , could be used , in turn , to probe lsmfs with strengths in the above range .",
    "suitable uhecr statistics could be achieved with future experiments , such as the japanese telescope array ( teshima _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , the high resolution fly s eye ( al - seady _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , and the pierre auger project ( cronin 1992 ) , that have the potential to detect @xmath8 particles per source with @xmath9ev , over a @xmath10 period .",
    "although the origin and nature of uhecrs are not known , they are likely to be generated in extragalactic sources ( _ e.g. _ , bird _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; yoshida _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; hayashida _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , such as powerful radio - galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , rachen & biermann 1993 ) , cosmological @xmath11ray bursts ( vietri 1995 ; waxman 1995 ; milgrom & usov 1996 ) , and/or topological defects ( _ e.g. _ , bhattacharjee , hill & schramm 1992 ; sigl 1996 ) .",
    "our results can also be used to discriminate between models of the origin of uhecrs .",
    "previous studies of the effect of the lsmf on uhecrs have included a discussion of the energy dependent deflection and time delay for extragalactic uhecrs ( cronin 1992 ; waxman & miralda - escud 1996 ; medina tanco _",
    "in addition , the effect of egmfs on secondary @xmath12-rays produced in the interaction of ultra - high energy protons with cmb photons can also probe egmfs below current upper limits : plaga ( 1995 ) and waxman & coppi ( 1996 ) proposed to use the arrival time delay of secondary @xmath12-rays in the tev range to probe egmfs of strengths @xmath13 g , while lee , olinto & sigl ( 1996 ) showed how fields of strength @xmath14 g affect the @xmath11ray spectrum around @xmath15 due to electron synchrotron losses .",
    "nucleons propagating in intergalactic space with energies @xmath16eev are mainly subject to scattering on the lsmfs and pair production on the cmb ( for protons ) , as well as photopion production on the cmb .",
    "pair production dominates the energy loss below @xmath17eev which we include as a continuous loss process ( chodorowski , zdziarski , & sikora 1992 ) . above @xmath17eev",
    "photopion production dominates and gives rise to the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin cutoff ( hereafter gzk cutoff ; greisen 1966 ; zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 ) .",
    "we model photopion production as a stochastic process where the chance of interaction is drawn at random , as described in lee ( 1996 ) , and sigl , lee , & coppi ( 1996 ) .",
    "we model the egmf as a gaussian random field , with zero mean in fourier space , and power spectrum : @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and @xmath20 otherwise .",
    "here , @xmath3 characterizes the cutoff scale of magnetic fluctuations ; we choose @xmath21 as a fiducial value for the egmf .",
    "the power spectrum is normalized via : @xmath22 .",
    "we leave the detail description of our monte - carlo code to sigl , lemoine , & olinto ( 1997 ) .",
    "a simpler version of the present study was carried out by medina tanco _",
    "these authors described the field as an assembly of randomly oriented bubbles of constant field , with diameter equal to the coherence length , and neglected the stochastic nature of pion production .",
    "finally , they considered the limit @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the distance to the source , and @xmath25 the r.m.s .",
    "deflection angle at energy @xmath26 ; this limit is obtained only for extreme choices of the magnetic field strength and configuration for @xmath27ev ( see below ) .",
    "the limit @xmath28 is not only the most probable for @xmath29ev , it also is the most difficult to treat ( see sigl , lemoine , & olinto ( 1997 ) .",
    "the importance of distinguishing the limits @xmath23 and @xmath28 , was pointed out by waxman & miralda - escud ( 1996 ) . in the latter limit ,",
    "all nucleons emitted by the source and captured on the detector have essentially experienced the same magnetic structure along their paths , hence the scatter around the mean of the correlations between the time delay @xmath30 , the deflection angle @xmath25 , and the energy @xmath26 , is of order 1% . in the opposite limit , @xmath23 ,",
    "the relative widths of these correlations are of order unity .",
    "our simulations generate data consisting of the energy , arrival time , and angular direction for each uhecr emitted from the source . for general reference",
    ", we can estimate the average deflection angle @xmath25 and the average time delay @xmath31 induced on a proton of energy @xmath32 over a distance @xmath24 in the limit @xmath23 . using ( waxman & miralda - escud 1996 ) : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the faraday rotation bound @xmath35gmpc@xmath2 , implies @xmath36 @xmath37yr , and @xmath38 @xmath39 , assuming @xmath40 . in what follows , we address the possible observables for different cases . in  2.1 and  2.2",
    ", we discuss the case of an extra - galactic bursting source . in  2.3 , we discuss the case of a continuously emitting source . in these sections",
    ", we consider the case in which the time delay induced by the extra - galactic magnetic field dominates over that of the halo magnetic field of our galaxy . in",
    " 2.4 , we discuss how the domination by a halo field would modify our conclusions .",
    "we use the notations @xmath41 , @xmath42 .      the best case for probing large scale magnetic fields as well as",
    "the nature of the source is : @xmath43 , _ i.e. _ , the time delay is comparable to the integration time of the experiment , @xmath44 . in this case",
    ", the limit @xmath28 holds as the faraday rotation bound is combined with @xmath43 . for a propagated differential energy spectrum @xmath45",
    ", that corresponds to the injected spectrum below the gzk cutoff , eq .",
    "( [ t_delay ] ) tells us that the arrival time distribution is given by @xmath46 , for a bursting source with emission timescale @xmath47 and a @xmath48 correlation with negligible scatter .",
    "note that a continuous source with @xmath49 would produce a uniform distribution of arrival times , notably independent of their energy ( see  2.4 ) .",
    "the observation of the arrival time and energy of two events is sufficient to determine a zero - point in time ( time of emission ) , hence the value of @xmath30 , equivalently @xmath50 .",
    "the distance can be independently derived by fitting the energy spectrum above the gzk cutoff , provided there is enough statistics .",
    "thus , one ends up with an estimate of the distance to the source , the nature of the source ( _ e.g. _ , burst _ vs. _ continuous emission ) , and the value of @xmath51 .",
    "observations of several clusters of events would thus `` map '' the extra - galactic magnetic field .",
    "finally , one can show , from @xmath52 , that the angular image would not be resolved for a typical detector with resolution @xmath53 .",
    "that typical time delays above tens of eev may be of the order of a few years , is suggested by a detailed likelihood analysis ( sigl , lemoine , & olinto 1997 ) of the three pairs of events that were recently reported by the agasa experiment ( hayashida 1996 ) .",
    "if @xmath54 , a given source will be seen only on a limited range in energy ( waxman & miralda - escud 1996 ) ; indeed , protons with higher energy have already reached us in the past , while protons with lower energy have yet to reach us .",
    "these authors have derived the shape of the energy spectrum in the limit @xmath23 , for @xmath55eev where the signal has significant scatter @xmath56% ; in the opposite limit @xmath28 , @xmath57% . in principle , the measure of the width would tell us which limit applies , and would give us some information about @xmath58 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , this statement depends strongly on the distance , as @xmath59 . for sufficiently large time delays , the angular image of the source",
    "could be resolved for @xmath32 , in which case the value of @xmath60 becomes accessible .",
    "moreover , the argument developed by waxman & miralda - escud ( 1996 ) would allow to place another constraint on these parameters , respectively @xmath61 or @xmath62 .    for sources that are observed above the pion production threshold",
    ", the previous statements do not apply .",
    "however , in this limit , one can use a similar reasoning to obtain an estimate of the distance . at a fixed time",
    ", only a given range of energies is observed . intuitively , the larger the distance , the more important the pion production , hence the broader the signal .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figures  [ f1 ] and  [ f2 ] .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the image of the source in the time - energy plane for a source lying at @xmath63 .",
    "the correlation @xmath64 is shown as a dotted line . in this plane",
    ", the effect of pion production is mainly to downscatter from higher energies to lower energies , with a trend toward increasing the time delay for a given energy at emission .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the correlation between the width of the signal in energy , as actually seen by the detector , _ vs. _ the mean energy of the signal .",
    "this signal is obtained as a slice in the @xmath48 image , integrated between @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 in this case and @xmath65 is arbitrary ; this slice is indicated in figure [ f1 ] by the dashed lines .",
    "an example of the signal in energy so obtained is shown in figure [ f3 ] in dashed line .",
    "the correlation shown in figure [ f2 ] was obtained by measuring the width of the signal for different mean energies , corresponding to different choices of @xmath65 , and adjusting a straight line fit .",
    "the shaded areas denote the 1@xmath68 range of ( numerical ) uncertainty .",
    "these uncertainties actually provide a hint of the actual experimental uncertainties associated with such measurements , as the number of particles used in the monte - carlo correspond to that expected from a typical uhecr source .",
    "as figure  [ f2 ] reveals , an estimate of the distance @xmath69 , could be achieved with reasonable accuracy . for @xmath70 , the width of the signal",
    "becomes dominated by the instrumental resolution , whereas for @xmath71 , statistics should insufficient .",
    "the case of a continous source , emitting on a timescale @xmath72 , is obtained by folding , on the time axis , the angle - time - energy image of a corresponding bursting source , with a top - hat of width @xmath72 . in principle , for a given magnetic field configuration , there will be an energy @xmath73 , such that @xmath74 . for @xmath75",
    ", no correlation is expected between arrival times and energies , as the arrival time distribution is dominated by the uniform top - hat in this limit . in contrast , for @xmath76 the source behaves just like a burst with respect to the observations ; since , in general , @xmath77 ( for radio - galaxy hot spots , for instance ) , one also has @xmath78 for @xmath79 . thus , this situation would be analogous to that discussed in  2.2 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the energy spectrum should show a cut - off around @xmath80 , as the uhecrs with @xmath76 have not yet reached us , even if they were among the first emitted .",
    "the transition between these two regimes is only observable if @xmath81 a few 100 eev . here",
    ", the lower bound is given by the requirement that the deflection angle in the galactic magnetic field should be less than a few degrees so that observed events can be associated with a common source .",
    "the upper bound is dictated by the statistics required to establish reasonable estimates of the correlations in time and energy .",
    "the simulation of a possible case is shown in figure  [ f3 ] , where the energy spectrum , as seen by the detector , is plotted for a total of 50 detected particles .",
    "the energy spectrum above @xmath73 can be used to estimate the distance @xmath24 , for a given injection spectrum , via a pion production fit ( see figure [ f3 ] ) .",
    "the angular image should be resolved for sufficiently large time delays ( see  2.2 ) , and the actual magnitude of @xmath30 can be derived , as @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , not only can the magnetic field strength @xmath83 be determined , the timescale of emission is also obtained as a by - product .",
    "if @xmath84 , the angular image would not be resolved , but the time delay could be directly measured , as in  2.1 , and the above results still hold . in the intermediate case , @xmath85 , one could only place an upper limit on the magnetic field strength , @xmath86 , hence an upper limit on @xmath30 and @xmath72 . for reasonable values of the distance",
    ", this constraint is already more stringent than the faraday rotation limit .",
    "if the field strength lies close to the faraday bound , the range @xmath87 is within reach .",
    "observation of several sources at various distances would enlarge the detectable range of emission time scales and time delays . in case no low - energy cutoff",
    "is seen down to @xmath88 , but the deflection angle is resolved , the above estimates of @xmath72 turn into lower limits .",
    "the opposite limit is given if @xmath89 for all @xmath26 up to the value where the experiment runs out of statistics .",
    "in this case the source behaves like a bursting source and the discussion in  2.2 applies .",
    "we note that , here , the deflection angle should be measurable , if @xmath90 , hence @xmath83 could be measured .      in principle , the results of  2.1 ,  2.2 and  2.3 , should be considered as constraints on both the egmf and the halo magnetic field , in the sense that @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 denote the deflections induced by the egmf and by the halo field respectively .",
    "the halo field has a significant effect if its strength is in the range @xmath5 and its scale height @xmath94 .",
    "present observational constraints are not conclusive ( see , _ e. g. _ , beck et al . 1996 , and kronberg 1994 ) ; some authors argue for significant halo fields with large scale heights , while others argue for smaller scale heights , @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , one can not _ a priori _ rule out the possibility that the deflection and time delays are dominated by the influence of the halo magnetic field , even if the nucleons originate from an extra - galactic source .",
    "if the effect of egmfs are weak , the results of  2.1 ,  2.2 , and  2.3 can be applied to the halo magnetic field by substituting the extension of the magnetic halo for the distance to the source .",
    "the only exception is that , for a bursting source , a strong correlation between arrival time and energy is expected even above the gzk cutoff irrespective of its distance .",
    "this is due to the absence of pion production during propagation through the halo when most of the time delay and deflection is accumulated .",
    "as well , in case the energy spectrum above the gzk cut - off could be observed , for instance for a continuous source as in  2.3 , or a burst with a small time delay , the absence of pion production would constitute a signature of the proximity of this source .",
    "we have shown that an egmf of strength @xmath4 , and/or a galactic halo magnetic field of strength @xmath96 , leave distinct signatures in the angle - time - energy images of uhecrs of energy @xmath6 , which could be used , inversely , to probe these fields .",
    "obviously , the respective detection or non - detection of a correlation between arrival times and energies marks a bursting source with a short time delay @xmath97 , or a continuous source with emission timescale @xmath98 .",
    "a bursting source with a large time delay would be seen with no significant correlation between arrival times and energies , however , only in a range of energy of width @xmath9930% ( waxman & miralda - escud , 1996 ) .",
    "the observation of an energy spectrum ( integrated over the observational window ) , up to the highest energies , that shows a cut - off at a low energy ( still above @xmath100 ) constitutes the signature of a continuous source with an activity time scale @xmath72 comparable to the typical time delay @xmath30 at the cut - off energy .",
    "information on the actual magnitude of @xmath72 is contained in the high end of the observed spectrum and in the arrival directions .",
    "the absence of a lower cutoff implies @xmath101 . in the limit of large time delays , deflection angles of events around @xmath15",
    "should be measurable , and the value of @xmath60 could be derived therefrom .",
    "if both the typical time delay and @xmath72 are smaller than the integration time , the whole spectrum above @xmath15 would be `` scanned through '' . in this case , both @xmath24 and @xmath83 could be determined .",
    "a more quantitative implementation of the effects discussed here should involve a likelihood approach .",
    "we have performed such an analysis for the three uhecr pairs recently suggested by agasa ( hayashida _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . although present data are much to sparse to draw any quantitative conclusions , we observed some potentially interesting tendencies ( sigl , lemoine , & olinto 1997 ) .",
    "one of the pairs , for instance , turns out to be inconsistent with a burst and comparatively small time delays of the order of a few years may be favored .",
    "strictly speaking , the analysis in the present paper applies to models that predict uhecr to be nucleons in the relevant energy range .",
    "topological defect models predict a domination of @xmath11rays above @xmath102 ( _ e.g. _ , sigl , lee , & coppi 1996 ) .",
    "however , due to its electronic content , the deflection and delay of an electromagnetic cascade roughly correspond to those of a nucleon of the same energy , modified by the relative lifetime fraction of electrons at that energy , typically a factor @xmath103 ( lee 1996 ) .",
    "we therefore expect our analysis to reproduce at least the correct tendencies also for defect models ."
