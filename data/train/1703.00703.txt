    "every time we can learn something new about cancer , the motivation goes without saying .",
    "cancer is different . unlike other diseases",
    ", it is not caused by ",
    "mechanical \" breakdowns , biochemical imbalances , etc .",
    "instead , cancer occurs at the dna level via somatic alterations in the genome structure .",
    "a common type of somatic mutations found in cancer is due to single nucleotide variations ( snvs ) or alterations to single bases in the genome , which accumulate through the lifespan of the cancer via imperfect dna replication during cell division or spontaneous cytosine deamination @xcite , @xcite , or due to exposures to chemical insults or ultraviolet radiation @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "these mutational processes leave a footprint in the cancer genome characterized by distinctive alteration patterns or mutational signatures .",
    "if we can identify all underlying signatures , this could greatly facilitate progress in understanding the origins of cancer and its development .",
    "therapeutically , if there are common underlying structures across different cancer types , then a therapeutic for one cancer type might be applicable to other cancers , which would be a great news",
    ". however , it all boils down to the question of usefulness , i.e. , is there a small enough number of cancer signatures underlying all ( 100 + ) known cancer types , or is this number too large to be meaningful or useful ?",
    "indeed , there are only 96 snvs , a , c @xmath4 g , c @xmath4 g , t @xmath4 a , t @xmath4 c , t @xmath4 g , whereas the other six base mutations are equivalent to these by base complementarity .",
    "each of these 6 possible base mutations is flanked by 4 possible bases on each side thereby producing @xmath5 distinct mutation categories .",
    "] so we can not have more than 96 signatures . even if the number of true underlying signatures is , say , of order 50 , it is unclear whether they would be useful , especially within practical applications . on the other hand ,",
    "if there are only a dozen or so underlying signatures , then we could hope for an order of magnitude simplification .    to identify mutational signatures ,",
    "one analyzes snv patterns in a cohort of dna sequenced whole cancer genomes .",
    "the data is organized into a matrix @xmath6 , where the rows correspond to the @xmath7 mutation categories , the columns correspond to @xmath8 samples , and each element is a nonnegative occurrence count of a given mutation category in a given sample .",
    "currently , the commonly accepted method for extracting cancer signatures from @xmath6 @xcite is via nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "under nmf the matrix @xmath9 is approximated via @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an @xmath12 matrix , @xmath13 is a @xmath14 matrix , and both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are nonnegative .",
    "the appeal of nmf is its biologic interpretation whereby the @xmath17 columns of the matrix @xmath15 are interpreted as the weights with which the @xmath17 cancer signatures contribute into the @xmath7 mutation categories , and the columns of the matrix @xmath16 are interpreted as the exposures to the @xmath17 signatures in each sample .",
    "the price to pay for this is that nmf , which is an iterative procedure , is computationally costly and depending on the number of samples @xmath8 it can take days or even weeks to run it .",
    "furthermore , it does not automatically fix the number of signatures @xmath17 , which must be either guessed or obtained via trial and error , thereby further adding to the computational cost .",
    "some of the aforesaid issues were recently addressed in @xcite , to wit : i ) by aggregating samples by cancer types , we can greatly improve stability and reduce the number of signatures ; , where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the number of cancer types , not of samples .",
    "this matrix is much less noisy than the sample data . ]",
    "ii ) by identifying and factoring out the somatic mutational noise , or the  overall \" mode ( this is the  de - noising \" procedure of @xcite ) , we can further greatly improve stability and , as a bonus , reduce computational cost ; and iii ) the number of signatures can be fixed borrowing the methods from statistical risk models @xcite in quantitative finance , by computing the effective rank ( or erank ) @xcite for the correlation matrix @xmath20 calculated across cancer types or samples ( see below ) .",
    "all this yields substantial improvements @xcite .",
    "in this paper we push this program to yet another level .",
    "the basic idea here is quite simple ( but , as it turns out , nontrivial to implement  see below ) .",
    "we wish to apply clustering techniques to the problem of extracting cancer signatures .",
    "in fact , we argue in section [ sec.2 ] that nmf is , to a degree ,  clustering in disguise \" .",
    "this is for two main reasons .",
    "the prosaic reason is that nmf , being a nondeterministic algorithm , requires averaging over many local optima it produces .",
    "however , each run generally produces a weights matrix @xmath11 with columns ( i.e. , signatures ) not aligned with those in other runs . aligning or matching the signatures across different runs ( before averaging over them ) is typically achieved via nondeterministic clustering such as k - means .",
    "so , not only is clustering utilized at some layer , the result , even after averaging , generally is both noisy and nondeterministic !",
    "i.e. , if this computationally costly procedure ( which includes averaging ) is run again and again on the same data , generally it will yield different looking cancer signatures every time !    the second , not - so - prosaic reason is that , while nmf generically does not produce exactly null weights , it does produce low weights , such that they are within error bars . for all practical purposes we might as well set such weights to zero .",
    "nmf requires nonnegative weights .",
    "however , we could as reasonably require that the weights should be , say , outside error bars ( e.g. , above one standard deviation  this would render the algorithm highly recursive and potentially unstable or computationally too costly ) or above some minimum threshold ( which would still further complicated as - is complicated nmf ) , or else the non - compliant weights are set to zero .",
    "as we increase this minimum threshold , the matrix @xmath11 will start to have more and more zeros .",
    "it may not exactly have a binary cluster - like structure , but it may at least have some substructures that are cluster - like .",
    "it then begs the question : are there cluster - like ( sub)structures present in @xmath11 or , generally , in cancer signatures ?    to answer this question , we can apply clustering methods directly to the matrix @xmath6 , or , more , precisely , to its de - noised version @xmath21 ( see below ) @xcite .",
    "the nave , bruit - force approach where one would simply cluster @xmath6 or @xmath21 does not work for a variety of reasons , some being more nontrivial or subtle than others .",
    "thus , e.g. , as discussed in @xcite , the counts @xmath6 have skewed , long - tailed distributions and one should work with log - counts , or , more precisely , their de - noised versions .",
    "this applies to clustering as well .",
    "further , following a discussion in @xcite in the context of quantitative trading , it would be suboptimal to cluster de - noised log - counts .",
    "instead , it pays to cluster their normalized variants ( see section [ sec.2 ] hereof ) .",
    "however , taking care of such subtleties does not alleviate one big problem : nondeterminism !",
    "if we run a vanilla nondeterministic algorithm such as k - means on the data however massaged with whatever bells and whistles , we will get random - looking disparate results every time we run k - means with no stability in sight .",
    "we need to address nondeterminism !    our solution to the problem is what we term _ k - means_. the idea behind * k - means , which essentially achieves determinism _ statistically _ , is simple .",
    "suppose we have an @xmath22 matrix @xmath23 , i.e. , we have @xmath24 @xmath8-vectors @xmath25 .",
    "if we run k - means with the input number of clusters @xmath17 but initially unspecified centers , every run will generally produce a new local optimum .",
    "* k - means reduces and in fact essentially eliminates this indeterminism via two levels . at level 1",
    "it takes clusterings obtained via @xmath26 independent runs or samplings .",
    "each sampling produces a binary @xmath12 matrix @xmath27 , whose element equals 1 if @xmath25 belongs to the cluster labeled by @xmath28 , and 0 otherwise . the aggregation algorithm and the source code therefor",
    "are given in @xcite .",
    "this aggregation  for the same reasons as in nmf ( see above )  involves aligning clusters across the @xmath26 runs , which is achieved via k - means , and so the result is nondeterministic .",
    "however , by aggregating a large number @xmath26 of samplings , the degree of nondeterminism is greatly reduced .",
    "the  catch \" is that sometimes this aggregation yields a clustering with @xmath29 clusters , but this does not pose an issue .",
    "thus , at level 2 , we take a large number @xmath30 of such aggregations ( each based on @xmath26 samplings ) .",
    "the occurrence counts of aggregated clusterings are not uniform but typically have a ( sharply ) peaked distribution around a few ( or manageable ) number of aggregated clusterings .",
    "so this way we can pinpoint the  ultimate \" clustering , which is simply the aggregated clustering with the highest occurrence count .",
    "this is the gist of * k - means and it works well for genome data .",
    "so , we apply * k - mean to the same genome data as in @xcite consisting of 1,389 ( published ) samples across 14 cancer types ( see below ) .",
    "our target number of clusters is 7 , which was obtained in @xcite using the erank based algorithm ( see above ) .",
    "we aggregated 1,000 samplings into clusterings , and we constructed 150,000 such aggregated clusterings ( i.e. , we ran 150 million k - means instances ) .",
    "we indeed found the  ultimate \" clustering with 7 clusters .",
    "once the clustering is fixed , it turns out that within - cluster weights can be computed via linear regressions ( with some bells and whistles ) and the weights are automatically positive .",
    "that is , we do not need nmf at all ! once we have clusters and weights , we can study reconstruction accuracy and within - cluster correlations between the underlying data and the fitted data that the cluster model produces .",
    "we find that clustering works well for 10 out the 14 cancer types we study .",
    "the cancer types for which clustering does not appear to work all that well are liver cancer , lung cancer , and renal cell carcinoma . also , above 80% within - cluster correlations arise for 5 out of 7 clusters .",
    "furthermore , remarkably , one cluster has high within - cluster correlations for 9 cancer types , and another cluster for 6 cancer types .",
    "these appear to be the leading clusters .",
    "together they have high within - cluster correlations in 11 out of 14 cancer types .",
    "so what does all this mean ?",
    "additional insight is provided by looking at the within - cluster correlations between signatures sig1 through sig7 extracted in @xcite and our clusters .",
    "high within - cluster correlations arise for sig1 , sig2 , sig4 and sig7 , which are precisely the signatures with  peaks \" ( or  spikes \"   tall mountain landscapes \" ) , whereas sig3 , sig5 and sig6 do not have such  peaks \" (  flat \" or  rolling hills landscapes \" ) ; see figures 14 through 20 of @xcite .",
    "the latter 3 signatures simply do not have cluster - like structures .",
    "looking at figure 21 in @xcite , it becomes evident why clustering does not work well for liver cancer ",
    "it has a whopping 96% contribution from sig5 !",
    "similarly , renal cell carcinoma has a 70% contribution from sig6 .",
    "lung cancer is dominated by sig3 , hence no cluster - like structure .",
    "so , liver cancer , lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma have little in common with other cancers ( and each other ) ! however , 11 other cancers , to wit , b cell lymphoma , bone cancer , brain lower grade glioma , breast cancer , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , esophageal cancer , gastric cancer , medulloblastoma , ovarian cancer , pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer , have 5 ( with 2 leading ) cluster structures substantially embedded in them .    in section [ sec.2 ] we i ) discuss why applying clustering algorithms to extracting cancer signatures makes sense , ii ) argue that nmf , to a degree , is  clustering in disguise \" , and iii ) give the machinery for building cluster models via * k - means , including various details such as what to cluster , how to fix the number of clusters , etc . in section [ sec.3 ] we discuss i ) cancer genome data we use , ii ) our application of * k - means to it , and iii ) the interpretation of our empirical results . section [ sec.4 ] contains some concluding remarks , including a discussion of potential applications of * k - means in quantitative finance , where we outline some concrete problems where * k - means can be useful .",
    "appendix [ app.code ] contains r source code for * k - means and cluster models .",
    "the chief objective of this paper is to introduce a novel approach to identifying cancer signatures using clustering methods .",
    "in fact , as we discuss below in detail , our approach is more than just clustering .",
    "indeed , it is evident from the get - go that blindly using nondeterministic clustering algorithms , which typically produce ( unmanageably ) large numbers of local optima , would introduce great variability into the resultant cancer signatures . on the other hand , deterministic algorithms such as agglomerative hierarchical clustering",
    "typically are ( substantially ) slower and require essentially  guessing \" the initial clustering , which in practical applications can often turn out to be suboptimal .",
    "so , both to motivate and explain our new approach employing clustering methods , we first  so to speak   break down \" the nmf approach and argue that it is in fact a clustering method in disguise !      the current  lore \"  the commonly accepted method for extracting @xmath17 cancer signatures from the occurrence counts matrix @xmath6 ( see above ) @xcite  is via nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "under nmf the matrix @xmath9 is approximated via @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an @xmath12 matrix of weights , @xmath13 is a @xmath14 matrix of exposures , and both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are nonnegative .",
    "however , not only is the number of signatures @xmath17 not fixed via nmf ( and must be either guessed or obtained via trial and error ) , nmf too is a nondeterministic algorithm and typically produces a large number of local optima .",
    "so , in practice one has no choice but to execute a large number @xmath31 of nmf runs  which we refer to as samplings  and then somehow extract cancer signatures from these samplings . absent a guess for what @xmath17 should be ,",
    "one executes @xmath31 samplings for a range of values of @xmath17 ( say , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are basically guessed based on some reasonable intuitive considerations ) , for each @xmath17 extracts cancer signatures ( see below ) , and then picks @xmath17 and the corresponding signatures with the best overall fit into the underlying matrix @xmath9 . for a given @xmath17 , different samplings generally produce different weights matrices @xmath15 .",
    "so , to extract a singe matrix @xmath15 for each value of @xmath17 one _ averages _ over the samplings .",
    "however , before averaging , one must match the @xmath17 cancer signatures across different samplings  indeed , in a given sampling x the columns in the matrix @xmath11 are not necessarily aligned with the columns in the matrix @xmath11 in a different sampling y. to align the columns in the matrices @xmath15 across the @xmath31 samplings , once often uses a clustering algorithm such as k - means .",
    "however , since k - means is nondeterministic , such alignment of the @xmath15 columns is not guaranteed to  and in fact does not  produce a unique answer . here",
    "one can try to run multiple samplings of k - means for this alignment and aggregate them , albeit such aggregation itself would require another level of alignment ( with its own nondeterministic clustering such as k - means ) . ] and one can do this _",
    "ad infinitum_. in practice , one must break the chain at some level of alignment , either _",
    "ad hoc _ ( essentially by heuristically observing sufficient stability and  convergence \" ) or via using a deterministic algorithm ( see fn .",
    "[ fn.alignment ] ) .",
    "either way , invariably all this introduces ( overtly or covertly ) systematic and statistical errors into the resultant cancer signatures and often it is unclear if they are meaningful without invoking some kind empirical biologic  experience \" or  intuition \" ( often based on already well - known effects of , e.g. , exposure to various well - understood carcinogens such as tobacco , ultraviolet radiation , aflatoxin , etc . ) . at the end of the day it all boils down to how useful  or _ predictive _ ",
    "the resultant method of extracting cancer signatures is , including signature stability .",
    "with nmf , the answer is not at all evident ...",
    "so , in practice , under the hood , nmf already uses clustering methods .",
    "however , it goes deeper than that . while nmf generically does not produce vanishing weights for a given signature , some weights are ( much ) smaller than others .",
    "e.g. , often one has several  peaks \" with high concentration of weights , with the rest of the mutation categories having relatively low weights .",
    "in fact , many weights can even be within the ( statistical plus systematic ) error bars .",
    "such weights can for all practical purposes be set to zero .",
    "in fact , we can take this further and ask whether proliferation of low weights adds any explanatory power .",
    "one way to address this is to run nmf with an additional constraint that the weights ( obtained via averaging  see above ) should be higher than either i ) some multiple of the corresponding error bars or ii ) some preset fixed minimum weight .",
    "this certainly sounds reasonable , so why is this not done in practice ?",
    "a prosaic answer appears to be that this would complicate the already nontrivial nmf algorithm even further , require additional coding and computation resources , etc .",
    "however , _ arguendo _",
    ", let us assume that we require , say , that the weights be higher than a preset fixed minimum weight @xmath35 or else the weights are set to zero . as we increase @xmath35 , the so - modified nmf would produce more and more zeros .",
    "this does not mean that the resulting matrix @xmath11 would have a _ binary _ cluster structure , i.e. , that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a kronecker delta and @xmath38 is a map from @xmath7 mutation categories to @xmath17 clusters .",
    "put another way , this does not mean that in the resulting matrix @xmath11 for a given @xmath39 ( i.e. , mutation category ) we would have a nonzero element for one and only one value of @xmath28 ( i.e. , signature ) .",
    "however , as we gradually increase @xmath35 , generally the matrix @xmath11 is expected to look more and more like having a binary cluster structure , albeit with some  overlapping \" signatures ( i.e. , such that in a given pair of signatures there are nonzero weights for one or more mutations ) .",
    "we can achieve a binary structure via a number of ways .",
    "thus , a rudimentary algorithm would be to take the matrix @xmath11 ( equally successfully before or after achieving some zeros in it via nonzero @xmath35 ) and for a given value of @xmath39 set all weights @xmath11 to zero except in the signature @xmath28 for which @xmath40 .",
    "note that this might result in some empty signatures ( clusters ) , i.e. , signatures with @xmath41 for all values of @xmath39 .",
    "this can be dealt with by i ) ether simply dropping such signatures altogether and having fewer @xmath29 signatures ( binary clusters ) at the end , or ii ) augmenting the algorithm to avoid empty clusters , which can be done in a number of ways we will not delve into here .",
    "the bottom line is that nmf essentially can be made into a clustering algorithm by reasonably modifying it , including via getting rid of ubiquitous and not - too - informative low weights .",
    "however , the downside would be an even more contrived algorithm , so this is not what we are suggesting here .",
    "instead , we are observing that clustering is already intertwined in nmf and the question is whether we can simplify things by employing clustering methods directly .",
    "happily , the answer is yes .",
    "not only can we have much simpler and apparently more stable clustering algorithms , but they are also computationally much less costly than nmf .",
    "as mentioned above , the biggest issue with using popular nondeterministic clustering algorithms such as k - means is that they produce a large number of local optima .",
    "for definiteness in the remainder of this paper we will focus on k - means , albeit the methods described herein are general and can be applied to other such algorithms .",
    "fortunately , this very issue has already been addressed in @xcite in the context of constructing statistical industry classifications ( i.e. , clustering models for stocks ) for quantitative trading , so here we simply borrow therefrom and further expand and adapt that approach to cancer signatures .",
    "a popular clustering algorithm is k - means @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind k - means is to partition @xmath24 observations into @xmath17 clusters such that each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean .",
    "each of the @xmath24 observations is actually a @xmath8-vector , so we have an @xmath42 matrix @xmath23 , @xmath43 , @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath44 be the @xmath17 clusters , @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "then k - means attempts to minimize should be for cancer signatures . ]",
    "@xmath47 where @xmath48 are the cluster centers ( i.e. , cross - sectional means ) , \" . ] and @xmath49 is the number of elements in the cluster @xmath44 . in ( [ k - means ] ) the measure of  closeness \" is chosen to be the euclidean distance between points in @xmath50 , albeit other measures are possible .",
    "one  drawback \" of k - means is that it is not a deterministic algorithm .",
    "generically , there are copious local minima of @xmath51 in ( [ k - means ] ) and the algorithm only guarantees that it will converge to a local minimum , not the global one .",
    "being an iterative algorithm , unless the initial centers are preset , k - means starts with a random set of the centers @xmath52 at the initial iteration and converges to a different local minimum in each run .",
    "there is no magic bullet here : in practical applications , typically , trying to  guess \" the initial centers is not any easier than  guessing \" where , e.g. , the global minimum is .",
    "so , what is one to do ?",
    "one possibility is to simply live with the fact that every run produces a different answer .",
    "in fact , this is acceptable in many applications . however , in the context of extracting cancer signatures this would result in an exercise in futility .",
    "we need a way to eliminate or greatly reduce indeterminism .",
    "the idea is simple .",
    "what if we _",
    "aggregate _ different clusterings from multiple runs  which we refer to as samplings  into one ?",
    "the question is how .",
    "suppose we have @xmath26 runs ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "each run produces a clustering with @xmath17 clusters .",
    "let @xmath54 , @xmath43 , @xmath46 ( here @xmath55 is the map between  in our case  the mutation categories and the clusters ) , in @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( see below ) is an index , not a power .",
    "] be the binary matrix from each run labeled by @xmath59 , which is a convenient way ( for our purposes here ) of encoding the information about the corresponding clustering ; thus , each row of @xmath56 contains only one element equal 1 ( others are zero ) , and @xmath60 ( i.e. , column sums ) is nothing but the number of mutations belonging to the cluster labeled by @xmath61 ( note that @xmath62 ) .",
    "here we are assuming that somehow we know how to properly order ( i.e. , align ) the @xmath17 clusters from each run .",
    "this is a nontrivial assumption , which we will come back to momentarily .",
    "however , assuming , for a second , that we know how to do this , we can aggregate the binary matrices @xmath56 into a single matrix @xmath63 . now",
    ", this matrix does not look like a binary clustering matrix .",
    "instead , it is a matrix of occurrence counts , i.e. , it counts how many times a given mutation was assigned to a given cluster in the process of @xmath26 samplings .",
    "what we need to construct is a map @xmath9 such that one and only one mutation belongs to each of the @xmath17 clusters .",
    "the simplest criterion is to map a given mutation to the cluster in which @xmath64 is maximal , i.e. , where said mutation occurs most frequently .",
    "a caveat is that there may be more than one such clusters .",
    "a simple criterion to resolve such an ambiguity is to assign said mutation to the cluster with most cumulative occurrences ( i.e. , we assign said mutation to the cluster with the largest @xmath65 ) .",
    "further , in the unlikely event that there is still an ambiguity , we can try to do more complicated things , or we can simply assign such a mutation to the cluster with the lowest value of the index @xmath61  typically , there is so much noise in the system that dwelling on such minutiae simply does not pay off .",
    "however , we still need to tie up a loose end , to wit , our assumption that the clusters from different runs were somehow all aligned . in practice",
    "each run produces @xmath17 clusters , but i ) they are not the same clusters and there is no foolproof way of mapping them , especially when we have a large number of runs ; and ii ) even if the clusters were the same or similar , they would not be ordered , i.e. , the clusters from one run generally would be in a different order than the clusters from another run .",
    "so , we need a way to  match \" clusters from different samplings .",
    "again , there is no magic bullet here either .",
    "we can do a lot of complicated and contrived things with not much to show for it at the end .",
    "a simple pragmatic solution is to use k - means to align the clusters from different runs .",
    "each run labeled by @xmath59 , among other things , produces a set of cluster centers @xmath66 .",
    "we can  bootstrap \" them by row into a @xmath67 matrix @xmath68 , where @xmath69 takes values @xmath70 .",
    "we can now cluster @xmath71 into @xmath17 clusters via k - means .",
    "this will map each value of @xmath72 to @xmath73 thereby mapping the @xmath17 clusters from each of the @xmath26 runs to @xmath73 .",
    "so , this way we can align all clusters .",
    "the  catch \" is that there is no guarantee that each of the @xmath17 clusters from each of the @xmath26 runs will be uniquely mapped to one value in @xmath73 , i.e. , we may have some empty clusters at the end of the day .",
    "however , this is fine , we can simply drop such empty clusters and aggregate ( via the above procedure ) the smaller number of @xmath29 clusters .",
    "i.e. , at the end we will end up with a clustering with @xmath74 clusters , which might be fewer than the target number of clusters @xmath17 .",
    "this is not necessarily a bad thing .",
    "the dropped clusters might have been redundant in the first place .",
    " catch \" is that even the number of resulting clusters @xmath74 is not deterministic .",
    "if we run this algorithm multiple times , we will get varying values of @xmath74 .",
    "malicious circle ?      not really !",
    "there is one other trick up our sleeves we can use to fix the  ultimate \" clustering thereby rendering our approach essentially deterministic .",
    "the idea above is to aggregate a large enough number @xmath26 of samplings .",
    "each aggregation produces a clustering with some @xmath75 clusters , and this @xmath74 varies from aggregation to aggregation .",
    "however , what if we take a large number @xmath30 of aggregations ( each based on @xmath26 samplings ) ? typically there will be a relatively large number of different clusterings we get this way .",
    "however , assuming some degree of stability in the data , this number is much smaller than the number of _ a priori _ different local minima we would obtain by running the vanilla k - means algorithm .",
    "what is even better , the occurrence counts of aggregated clusterings are not uniform but typically have a ( sharply ) peaked distribution around a few ( or manageable ) number of aggregated clusterings .",
    "in fact , as we will see below , in our empirical genome data we are able to pinpoint the  ultimate \" clustering !",
    "so , to recap , what we have done here is this .",
    "there are myriad clusterings we can get via vanilla k - means with little to no guidance as to which one to pick .",
    "we have reduced this proliferation by aggregating a large number of such clusterings into our aggregated clusterings .",
    "we then further zoom onto a few or even a unique clustering we consider to be the likely  ultimate \" clustering by examining the occurrence counts of such aggregated clusterings , which turns out to have a ( sharply ) peaked distribution . since vanilla",
    "k - means is a relatively fast - converging algorithm , each aggregation is not computationally taxing and running a large number of aggregations is nowhere as time consuming as running a similar number ( or even a fraction thereof ) of nmf computations ( see below ) .",
    "so , now that we know how to make clustering work , we need to decide what to cluster , i.e. , what to take as our matrix @xmath23 in ( [ k - means ] ) .",
    "the nave choice @xmath76 is suboptimal for multiple reasons ( as discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "first , the elements of the matrix @xmath6 are populated by nonnegative occurrence counts .",
    "nonnegative quantities with large numbers of samples tend to have skewed distributions with long tails at higher values .",
    "i.e. , such distributions are not normal but ( in many cases ) roughly log - normal .",
    "one simple way to deal with this is to identify @xmath23 with a ( natural ) logarithm of @xmath6 ( instead of @xmath6 itself ) .",
    "a minor hiccup here is that some elements of @xmath6 can be 0 .",
    "we can do a lot of complicated and even convoluted things to deal with this issue . here , as in @xcite",
    ", we will follow a pragmatic approach and do something simple instead  there is so much noise in the data that doing convoluted things simply does not pay off .",
    "so , as the first cut , we can take @xmath77 this takes care of the @xmath78 cases ; for @xmath79 we have @xmath80 , as desired .",
    "second , the detailed empirical analysis of @xcite uncovered what is termed therein the  overall \" mode unequivocally present in the occurrence count data .",
    "overall \" mode is interpreted as somatic mutational _ noise _ unrelated to ( and in fact obscuring ) the true underlying cancer signatures and must therefore be factored out somehow . here is a simple way to understand the  overall \" mode . let the correlation matrix @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is serial correlation .",
    "i.e. , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 are variances , and the serial covariance matrix , i.e. , @xmath85 ( unbiased estimate ) vs. @xmath8 ( maximum likelihood estimate ) in the denominator in the definition of @xmath86 in ( [ cov ] ) , is immaterial for our purposes here . ]",
    "@xmath87 where @xmath88 are serially demeaned , while the means @xmath89",
    ". the average pair - wise correlation @xmath90 between different mutation categories is nonzero and is in fact high for most cancer types we study .",
    "this is the aforementioned somatic mutational noise that must be factored out .",
    "if we aggregate samples by cancer types ( see below ) and compute the correlation matrix @xmath20 for the so - aggregated data ( across the @xmath91 cancer types we study  see below ) , in ( [ cov ] ) . ]",
    "the average correlation @xmath92 is over whopping 96% .",
    "another way of thinking about this is that the occurrence counts in different samples ( or cancer types , if we aggregate samples by cancer types ) are not normalized uniformly across all samples ( cancer types ) .",
    "therefore , running nmf , a clustering or any other signature - extraction algorithm on the vanilla matrix @xmath6 ( or its  log \" @xmath23 defined in ( [ log.def ] ) ) would amount to mixing apples with oranges thereby obscuring the true underlying cancer signatures .",
    "following @xcite , factoring out the  overall \" mode ( or  de - noising \" the matrix @xmath6 ) therefore most simply amount to cross - sectional ( i.e. , across the 96 mutation categories ) demeaning of the matrix @xmath23 .",
    "i.e. , instead of @xmath23 we use @xmath93 , which is obtained from @xmath23 by demeaning its columns : , not @xmath6 . ]",
    "@xmath94 we should note that using @xmath93 instead of @xmath23 in ( [ k - means ] ) does not affect clustering .",
    "indeed , @xmath51 in ( [ k - means ] ) is invariant under the transformations of the form @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is an arbitrary @xmath8-vector , as thereunder we also have @xmath97 , so @xmath98 is unchanged .",
    "in fact , this is good : this means that de - noising does not introduce any additional errors into clustering itself .",
    "however , the actual _ weights _ in the matrix @xmath11 are affected by de - noising .",
    "we discuss the algorithm for fixing @xmath11 below .",
    "however , we need one more ingredient before we get to determining the weights , and with this additional ingredient de - noising does affect clustering .      as was discussed in @xcite , clustering @xmath23 ( or equivalently @xmath93 ) would be suboptimal .",
    "the issue is this .",
    "let @xmath99 be serial standard deviations , i.e. , @xmath100 , where , as above , @xmath101 is serial covariance . here",
    "we assume that samples are aggregated by cancer types , so @xmath18 with @xmath102 .",
    "now , @xmath99 are not cross - sectionally uniform and vary substantially across mutation categories .",
    "the density of @xmath103 is depicted in figure [ figurevoldensity ] and is skewed ( tailed ) .",
    "the summary of @xmath103 reads : min = 0.2196 , 1st qu .",

    "= 0.6060 , max = 1.0010 , sd = 0.1917 , mad = 0.1859 , skewness = 0.8498 . if we simply cluster @xmath93 , this variability in @xmath103 will not be accounted for .",
    "a simple solution is to cluster normalized demeaned log - counts @xmath104 instead of @xmath93 . this way we factor out the nonuniform ( and skewed ) standard deviation out of the log - counts .",
    "note that now de - noising does make a difference in clustering .",
    "indeed , if we use @xmath105 ( recall that @xmath106 ) instead of @xmath104 in ( [ k - means ] ) and ( [ centers ] ) , the quantity @xmath51 ( and also clusterings ) will be different .      now that we know what to cluster ( to wit , @xmath107 ) and how to get to the ",
    "unique \" clustering , we need to figure out how to fix the ( target ) number of clusters @xmath17 , which is one of the inputs in our algorithm above . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that in the context of cancer signatures their number can be fixed by building a statistical factor model @xcite , i.e. , the number of signatures is simply the number of statistical factors .",
    "so , by the same token , here we identify the ( target ) number of clusters in our clustering algorithm with the number of statistical factors fixed via the method of @xcite .",
    "so , following @xcite and @xcite , we set can be replaced by @xmath108 . ]",
    "@xmath109 here @xmath110 is the effective rank @xcite of a symmetric semi - positive - definite ( which suffices for our purposes here ) matrix @xmath111 . it is defined as @xmath112 where @xmath113 are the @xmath114 _ positive _ eigenvalues of @xmath111 , and @xmath16 has the meaning of the ( shannon a.k.a .",

    "this is due to the fact that many @xmath8-vectors @xmath93 can be serially highly correlated ( which manifests itself by a large gap in the eigenvalues ) thereby further reducing the effective dimensionality of the correlation matrix .      the one remaining thing to accomplish is to figure out how to compute the weights @xmath11 .",
    "happily , in the context of clustering we have significant simplifications compared with nmf and computing the weights becomes remarkably simple once we fix the clustering , i.e. , the matrix @xmath116 ( or , equivalently , the map @xmath117 , @xmath43 , @xmath118 , where for the notational convenience we use @xmath17 to denote the number of clusters in the  ultimate \" clustering",
    " see above ) .",
    "just as in nmf , we wish to approximate the matrix @xmath6 via a product of the weights matrix @xmath11 and the exposure matrix @xmath13 , both of which must be nonnegative .",
    "more precisely , since we must remove the  overall \" mode , i.e. , de - noise the matrix @xmath6 , following @xcite , instead of @xmath6 we will approximate the re - exponentiated demeaned log - counts matrix @xmath93 : @xmath119 we can include an overall normalization by taking @xmath120 , or @xmath121 , or @xmath122 ( recall that @xmath123 is the vector of column means of @xmath23  see eq .",

    "so , we wish to approximate @xmath21 via a product @xmath124 .",
    "however , with clustering we have @xmath125 , i.e. , we have a block ( cluster ) structure where for a given value of @xmath28 all @xmath11 are zero except for @xmath126 , i.e. , for the mutation categories labeled by @xmath39 that belong to the cluster labeled by @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , our matrix factorization of @xmath6 into a product @xmath124 now simplifies into a set of @xmath17 _ independent _ factorizations as follows : @xmath127 so , there is no need to run nmf anymore ! indeed ,",
    "if we can somehow fix @xmath13 for a given cluster , then within this cluster we can determine the corresponding weights @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) via a _",

    "note that this regression is run _ without _ the intercept .",
    "now , this all makes sense as ( for each @xmath138 ) the regression minimizes the quadratic error term @xmath139 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath13 are nonnegative , then the weights @xmath128 are _ automatically nonnegative _ as they are given by : @xmath140 now , we wish these weights to be normalized : @xmath141 this can always be achieved by rescaling @xmath13 .",
    "alternatively , we can pick @xmath13 without worrying about the normalization , compute @xmath128 via ( [ w.reg ] ) , rescale them so that they satisfy ( [ w.norm ] ) , and simultaneously accordingly rescale @xmath13 . mission accomplished !",
    "well , almost ... we still need to figure out how to fix the exposures @xmath13 .",
    "the simplest way to do this is to note that we can use the matrix @xmath142 to swap the index @xmath39 in @xmath21 by the index @xmath28 , i.e. , we can take @xmath143 that is , up to the normalization constants @xmath144 ( which are fixed via ( [ w.norm ] ) ) we simply take cross - sectional means of @xmath21 in each cluster .",

    "so , why does ( [ h ] ) make sense ? looking at ( [ g.reg ] ) , we can observe that , if the residuals @xmath131 cross - sectionally , within each cluster labeled by @xmath28 , are random , then we expect that @xmath146 . if we had an exact equality here , then we would have ( [ h ] ) with @xmath147 ( i.e. , @xmath148 ) assuming the normalization ( [ w.norm ] ) . in practice , the residuals @xmath131 are not exactly  random \" .",
    "first , the number @xmath136 of mutation categories in each cluster is not large .",
    "second , as mentioned above , there is variability in serial standard deviations across mutation types .",
    "this leads us to consider variations .",
    "above we argued that it makes sense to cluster normalized demeaned log - counts @xmath149 due to the cross - sectional variability ( and skewness ) in the serial standard deviations @xmath103 .",
    "we may worry about similar effects in @xmath21 when computing @xmath13 and @xmath128 as we did above .",
    "this can be mitigated by using normalized quantities @xmath150 , where @xmath151 are serial variances .",
    "that is , we can define are approximately random in ( [ g.reg ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath152 where @xmath153 .",
    "so , @xmath154 are the weights in the averages over the clusters .      here one may wonder , considering the skewed roughly log - normal distribution of @xmath6 and henceforth @xmath21 , would it make sense to relate the exposures to within - cluster cross - sectional averages of demeaned log - counts @xmath93 as opposed to those of @xmath21 ?",
    "this is easily achieved .",
    "thus , we can define ( this ensures positivity of @xmath13 ) : @xmath155 exponentiating we get @xmath156^{1/n_a}\\ ] ] i.e. , instead of an arithmetic average as in ( [ h ] ) , here we have a geometric average .",
    "as above , here too we can introduce nontrivial weights .",
    "note that the form of ( [ w.reg.1 ] ) is the same as ( [ w.reg ] ) , it is only @xmath13 that is affected by the weights .",
    "so , we can introduce the weights in the geometric means as follows : @xmath157 where @xmath158 .",
    "recall that @xmath159 .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath160 so , the weights are the exponents @xmath161 .",
    "other variations are also possible .",
    "we are now ready to discuss an actual implementation of the above algorithm , much of the r code for which is already provided in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the r source code is given in appendix [ app.code ] hereof .",
    "in our empirical analysis below we use the same genome data ( from published samples only ) as in @xcite .",

    "@xmath169 is the number of samples for the cancer type labeled by @xmath170 .",
    "the combined matrix @xmath6 is obtained simply by appending ( i.e. , bootstrapping ) the matrices @xmath164_{is}$ ] together column - wise . in the case of the data we use here ( see above ) , this  big matrix \" turns out to have 1389 columns .",
    "generally , individual matrices @xmath164_{is}$ ] and , thereby , the  big matrix \" , contain a lot of noise .",
    "for some cancer types we can have a relatively small number of samples . we can also have  sparsely populated \" data , i.e. , with many zeros for some mutation categories . as mentioned above ,",
    "different samples are not necessarily uniformly normalized .",
    "the bottom line is that the data is noisy .",
    "furthermore , intuitively it is clear that the larger the matrix we work with , statistically the more  signatures \" ( or clusters ) we should expect to get with any reasonable algorithm .",
    "however , as mentioned above , a large number of signatures would be essentially useless and defy the whole purpose of extracting them in the first place  we have 96 mutation categories , so it is clear that the number of signatures can not be more than 96 !",
    "if we end up with , say , 50 + signatures , what new or useful does this tell us about the underlying cancers ?",
    "the answer is likely nothing other than that most cancers have not much in common with each other , which would be a disappointing result from the perspective of therapeutic applications . to mitigate the aforementioned issues , at least to a certain extent , following @xcite , we can aggregate samples by cancer types . this way we get an @xmath171 matrix , which we also refer to as @xmath6 , where the index @xmath18 now takes @xmath19 values corresponding to the cancer types . in the data we use",
    "@xmath172 , the aggregated matrix @xmath6 is much less noisy than the  big matrix \" , and we are ready to apply the above machinery to it .",
    "the @xmath173 matrix @xmath6 given in tables [ table.aggr.data.1 ] and [ table.aggr.data.2 ] is what we pass into the function bio.cl.sigs ( ) in appendix [ app.code ] as the input matrix x. we use : iter.max = 100 ( this is the maximum number of iterations used in the built - in r function kmeans ( )  we note that there was not a single instance in our 150 million runs of kmeans ( ) where more iterations were required ) ; num.try = 1000 ( this is the number of individual k - means samplings we aggregate every time ) ; and num.runs = 150000 ( which is the number of aggregated clusterings we use to determine the  ultimate \"  that is , the most frequently occurring  clustering ) .",

    "more precisely , we ran 15 batches with num.runs = 10000 as a sanity check , to make sure that the final result based on 150000 aggregated clusterings was consistent with the results based on smaller batches , i.e. , that it was in - sample stable .",
    "; however , the actual occurrence counts are different across the batches with slight variability in the corresponding rankings .",
    "the results are pleasantly stable . ] based on table [ table.occurrence.cts ] , we identify clustering - a as the  ultimate \" clustering ( cf .",
    "clustering - b / c / d ) .",
    "we give the weights for clustering - a , clustering - b , clustering - c and clustering - d using unnormalized and normalized regressions with exposures computed based on arithmetic averages ( see subsection [ sub.reg ] ) in tables [ table.weights.a.1 ] , [ table.weights.a.2 ] , [ table.weights.b.1 ] , [ table.weights.b.2 ] , [ table.weights.c.1 ] , [ table.weights.c.2 ] , [ table.weights.d.1 ] , [ table.weights.d.2 ] , and figures [ figure1a ] through [ figurenorm6d ] .",

    "looking at table [ table.fit.theta ] a few things become immediately evident .",
    "clustering works well for 10 out the 14 cancer types we study here .",
    "the cancer types for which clustering does not appear to work all that well are breast cancer ( labeled by x4 in table [ table.fit.theta ] ) , liver cancer ( x8 ) , lung cancer ( x9 ) , and renal cell carcinoma ( x14 ) .",
    "more precisely , for breast cancer we do have a high within - cluster correlation for cl-5 ( and also cl-4 ) , but the overall fit is not spectacular due to low within - cluster correlations in other clusters .",
    "also , above 80% within - cluster correlations arise for 5 clusters , to wit , cl-1 , cl-3 , cl-4 , cl-5 and cl-6 , but not for cl-2 or cl-7",
    ". furthermore , remarkably , cl-1 has high within - cluster correlations for 9 cancer types , and cl-5 for 6 cancer types .",
    "these appear to be the leading clusters .",
    "together they have high within - cluster correlations in 11 cancer types .",
    "so what does all this mean ?",
    "additional insight is provided by looking at the within - cluster correlations between the 7 cancer signature extracted in @xcite and the clusters we find here .",
    "let @xmath186 be the weights for the 7 cancer signatures from tables 13 and 14 of @xcite .",

    "high within - cluster correlations arise for cl-1 ( with sig1 and sig7 ) , cl-5 ( with sig2 ) and cl-6 ( with sig4 ) . and this makes perfect sense . indeed , looking at figures 14 through 20 of @xcite , sig1 , sig2 , sig4 and sig7 are precisely the cancer signatures that have  peaks \" ( or  spikes \"   tall mountain landscapes \" ) , whereas sig3 , sig5 and sig6 do not have such  peaks \" (  flat \" or  rolling hills landscapes \" ) .",
    "no wonder such signatures do not have high within - cluster correlations ",
    "they simply do not have cluster - like structures .",

    "similarly , renal cell carcinoma ( x14 ) has a 70% contribution from sig6 .",
    "lung cancer ( x9 ) is dominated by sig3 , hence no cluster - like structure .",

    "so , it all makes sense .",
    "the question is , what does all this tell us about cancer signatures ?    quite a bit !",
    "it tells us that cancers such as liver cancer , lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma have little in common with other cancers ( and each other ) ! at least at the level of mutation categories that dominate the genome structure of such cancers . on the other hand , 9 cancers , to wit ,",

    "however , it could also be a bad news from the therapeutic standpoint .",
    "since these cancer types appear to have little in common with others , it is likely that they would require specialized therapeutics . on the flipside",
    ", we should note that it would make sense to exclude these 3 cancer types when running clustering analysis .",
    "however , it would also make sense to include other cancer types by utilizing the international cancer genome consortium data , which we leave for future studies .",
    "( for comparative reasons , here we used the same data as in @xcite , which was limited to data samples published as of the date thereof . ) this paper is not intended to be an exhaustive empirical study but a proof of concept and an opening of a new avenue for extracting and studying cancer signatures beyond the tools that nmf provides .",
    "and we do find that 11 out of the 14 cancer types we study here have clustering structures substantially embedded in them and clustering overall works well for at least 10 out of these 11 cancer types . now , looking at figure 14 of @xcite , we see that its  peaks \" are located at acgt , ccgt , gcgt and tcgt .",
    "the same  peaks \" are present in our cluster cl-1 ( see figures [ figure1a ] and [ figurenorm1a ] ) . hence the high within - cluster correlation between cl-1 and sig1 . on the other hand , sig1 of @xcite",
    "is essentially the same as the mutational signature 1 of @xcite , @xcite , which is due to spontaneous cytosine deamination .",
    "so , this is what our cluster cl-1 describes .",
    "next , looking at figure 15 of @xcite , we see that its  peaks \" are located at tcag , tctg , tcat and tctt .",
    "the first two of these  peaks \" tcag and tctg are present in our cl-5 ( see figures [ figure5a ] and [ figurenorm5a ] ) , the third  peak \" tcat is present in our cl-1 ( see figures [ figure1a ] and [ figurenorm1a ] ) , while the fourth  peak \" tctt is present in our cl-4 ( see figures [ figure4a ] and [ figurenorm4a ] ) , which is consistent with the high within - cluster correlations between sig2 and cl-4 and cl-5 , albeit its within - cluster correlation with cl-1 is poor . note that sig2 of @xcite is essentially the same as the mutational signatures 2 + 13 of @xcite , @xcite , which are due to apobec mediated cytosine deamination .",
    "in fact , it was reported as a single signature in @xcite , however , subsequently , it was split into 2 distinct signatures , which usually appear in the same samples .",
    "our clustering results indicate that grouping tcag and tctg into one signature makes sense as they belong to the same cluster cl-5 .",
    "however , grouping tcat and tctt together does not appear to make much sense .",
    "looking at the figures for clustering - a , clustering - b , clustering - c and clustering - d , we see that the tcat ",
    "peak \" invariably appears together with the acgt , ccgt , gcgt and tcgt  peaks \" as in cl-1 in clustering - a , cl-2 in clustering - b , cl-1 in clustering - c , and cl-1 in clustering - d , but never with tctt .",
    "so , our clustering approach tells us something new beyond the nmf ",
    "intuition \" .",
    "this may have an important implication for breast cancer , which , as mentioned above , is dominated by sig2 .",
    "thus , based on our results in table [ table.fit.theta ] , we see that breast cancer has high within - cluster correlations with cl-4 and cl-5 , but not with cl-1 .",
    "this may imply that clustering simply does not work well for breast cancer , which would appear to put it in the same  stand - alone \" league as liver cancer , lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma . in any event",
    ", clustering invariably suggests that the tcat  peak \" belongs in cl-1 with the 4  peaks \" acgt , ccgt , gcgt and tcgt related to spontaneous cytosine deamination , rather than those related to apobec mediated cytosine deamination .",
    "now , let us check the remaining two signatures of @xcite with  tall mountain landscapes \" ( see above ) , to wit , sig4 and sig7 .",
    "looking at figure 17 of @xcite , we see that its  peaks \" are at cttc , tttc , cttg and tttg .",
    "the same peaks appear in our cl-6 ( see figures [ figure6a ] and [ figurenorm6a ] ) . hence the high within - cluster correlation between cl-6 and sig4 .",
    "note that sig4 is essentially the same as the mutational signature 17 of @xcite , @xcite , and its underlying mutational process is unknown .",
    "next , looking at figure 20 of @xcite , we see that its  peaks \" for the c @xmath4 g mutations are essentially the same as in cl-1 .",
    "hence the high within - cluster correlation between cl-7 and sig1 .",
    "so , there are no surprises with sig1 , sig4 and sig7 .",
    "however , based on our clustering results , as we discuss above , with sig2 we do find  what we feel is a pleasant  surprise , that splitting it into two signatures ( see above ) might be inadequate and the tcat ",
    "peak \" might really belong with the sig1  peaks \" ( spontaneous v. apobec mediated cytosine deamination ) .",
    "this is exciting as it might be an indication of the limitations of nmf ( or clustering ... ) .",
    "in introduction we promised that we would discuss some potential applications of * k - means in quantitative finance , and so here it is .",
    "let us mention that * k - means is universal , oblivious to the input data and applicable in a variety of fields . in quantitative finance * k - means _ a priori _ can be applied everywhere clustering methods are used with the added bonus of ( statistical ) determinism .",
    "one evident example is statistical industry classifications discussed in @xcite , where one uses clustering methods to classify stocks . in fact , * k - means is an extension of the methods discussed in @xcite .",
    "one thing to keep in mind is that in * k - means one sifts through a large number @xmath30 of aggregations , which can get computationally costly when clustering 2000 + stocks into 100 + clusters .",
    "another potential application is in the context of combining alphas ( trading signals )  see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "yet another application is when we have a term structure , such as a portfolio of bonds ( e.g. , u.s . treasuries or some other bonds ) with varying maturities , or futures ( e.g. , eurodollar futures ) with varying deliveries .",
    "these cases resemble the genome data more in the sense that the number @xmath24 of instruments is relatively small ( typically even fewer than the number of mutation categories ) .",
    "another example with a relatively small number of instruments would be a portfolio of various futures for different fx ( foreign exchange ) pairs ( even with the uniform delivery ) , e.g. , usd / eur , usd / hkd , eur / aud , etc .",
    ", i.e. , fx statistical arbitrage .",
    "one approach to optimizing risk in such portfolios is by employing clustering methods and a stable , essentially deterministic algorithm such as * k - means can be useful .",
    "hopefully * k - means will prove a valuable tool in cancer research , quantitative finance as well as various other fields ( e.g. , image recognition ) .",
    "in this appendix we give the r ( r package for statistical computing , http://www.r-project.org ) source code for computing the clusterings and weights using the algorithms of section [ sec.2 ] .",
    "the code is straightforward and self - explanatory .",
    "hereof is not written to be  fancy \" or optimized for speed or in any other way .",
    "its sole purpose is to illustrate the algorithms described in the main text in a simple - to - understand fashion .",
    "see appendix [ app.disc ] for some important legalese . ]",
    "the main function is bio.cl.sigs(x , iter.max = 100 , num.try = 1000 , num.runs = 10000 ) . here",
    ": x is the @xmath22 occurrence counts matrix @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the number of mutation categories , and @xmath8 is the number of samples ; or @xmath19 , where @xmath166 is the number of cancer types , when the samples are aggregated by cancer types ) ; iter.max is the maximum number of iterations that are passed into the r built - in function kmeans ( ) ; num.try is the number @xmath26 of aggregated clusterings ( see subsection [ sub.aggr ] ) ; num.runs is the number of runs @xmath30 used to determine the most frequently occurring clustering ( the  ultimate \" clustering ) obtained via aggregation ( see subsection [ sub.ultimate ] ) .",
    "the function bio.erank.pc ( ) is defined in appendix b of @xcite .",
    "the function qrm.stat.ind.class ( ) is defined in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "this function internally calls another function qrm.calc.norm.ret ( ) , which we redefine here via the function bio.calc.norm.ret ( ) . the output is a list , whose elements are as follows : res$ind is an @xmath189 binary matrix @xmath142 ( @xmath43 , @xmath118 , the map @xmath38  see section [ sec.2 ] ) , which defines the @xmath17 clusters in the  ultimate \" clustering ; clusters ordered such that the number of mutation @xmath136 ( i.e. , the column sum of @xmath27 ) in the cluster labeled by @xmath28 is in the increasing order .",
    "it also orders clusters with identical @xmath136 .",
    "we note , however , that ( for presentational convenience reasons ) the order of such clusters in the tables and figures below is not necessarily the same as what this code returns . ]",
