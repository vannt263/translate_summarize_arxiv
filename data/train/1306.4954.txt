    "the nature of dark matter ( dm ) is among the most intriguing questions of modern physics .",
    "there is a body of strong and convincing evidence of its existence . indeed , numerous independent tracers of gravitational potential ( observations of the motion of stars in galaxies and galaxies in clusters ; emissions from hot ionized gas in galaxy groups and clusters ; 21  cm line in galaxies ; both weak and strong gravitational lensing measurements ) demonstrate that the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters can not be explained by the newtonian potential created by visible matter only .",
    "moreover , cosmological data ( analysis of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and of the statistics of galaxy number counts ) shows that the cosmic large scale structure started to develop much before decoupling of photons at recombination of hydrogen in the early universe and , therefore , much before ordinary matter could start clustering .",
    "this body of evidence points at the existence of a new substance , universally distributed in objects of all scales and providing a contribution to the total energy density of the universe at the level of about 25% .",
    "various attempts to explain this phenomenon by the presence of macroscopic compact objects ( such as , for example , old stars ) or by modifications of the laws of gravity ( or of dynamics ) failed to provide a consistent description of all the above phenomena .",
    "the abundance of baryonic dark matter is strongly constrained by numerous microlensing experiments ( in form of massive compact halo objects in mass range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , see e.g.  @xcite ; for an overview see @xcite and references therein ) and the results of big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "attempts to explain dark matter by the existence of primordial black holes have not been fully successful ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a microscopic origin of dark matter phenomenon ( i.e.  a new particle or particles ) remains appealing hypothesis .",
    "the only electrically neutral and long - lived particle in the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) are neutrinos . as the experiments show that neutrinos have mass , they could play the role of dark matter particles .",
    "neutrinos are involved in weak interactions that keep these particles in the early universe in thermal equilibrium down to the temperatures of few mev . at smaller temperatures , the interaction rate of weak reactions drops below the expansion rate of the universe and neutrinos `` freeze out '' from the equilibrium .",
    "therefore , a background of relic neutrinos was created just before primordial nucleosynthesis . as interaction strength and ,",
    "therefore , decoupling temperature and concentration of these particles are known , their present day density is fully defined by the sum of the masses for all neutrino flavors . to constitute the whole dm this mass should be about 11.5  ev ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , this mass is in conflict with the existing experimental bounds : measurements of the electron spectrum of @xmath2-decay put the combination of neutrino masses below 2  ev  @xcite while from the cosmological data one can infer an upper bound of the sum of neutrino masses is @xmath3  ev  @xcite .",
    "the fact that neutrinos could not constitute 100% of dm follows also from the study of phase space density of dm - dominated objects that should not exceed the density of degenerate fermi gas : fermionic particles could play the role of dm in dwarf galaxies only if their mass is above few hundreds of ev ( the so - called ` tremaine  gunn bound '  @xcite , for review see @xcite and references therein ) and in galaxies if their mass is above few tens of ev .",
    "moreover , as the mass of neutrinos is much smaller than their decoupling temperature , they decouple relativistic and become non - relativistic only in matter - dominated epoch ( `` hot dark matter '' ) .",
    "for such a dark matter the history of structure formation would be very different and the universe would look rather differently nowadays  @xcite .",
    "all these strong arguments prove convincingly that _ dominant fraction of dark matter _ can not be made of the standard model neutrinos and therefore _ the standard model of elementary particles does not contain a viable dm candidate .",
    "_ therefore , the dm particle hypothesis necessarily implies an extension of the sm , see e.g.  @xcite for a review of dm particle candidates .",
    "phenomenologically little is known about the properties of dm particles .",
    "the mass of fermionic dm is limited from below by the ` tremaine  gunn bound ' .",
    "they are not necessarily stable , but their lifetime should significantly exceed the age of the universe ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ; dm particles should have become non - relativistic sufficiently early in the radiation - dominated epoch ( although a sub - dominant fraction might have remained relativistic much later ) .",
    "a lot of attention has been devoted to the class of dark matter candidates called _ weakly interacting massive particles _ ( wimps ) ( see e.g.  @xcite for review ) .",
    "these hypothetical particles generalize the neutrino dm  @xcite : they also interact with the sm sector with roughly electroweak strength , however their mass is large enough so that these particles become non - relativistic already at decoupling . in this case",
    "the present day density of such particles depends very weakly ( logarithmically ) on the mass of the particle as long as it is heavy enough .",
    "this `` universal '' density happens to be within the order of magnitude consistent with dm density ( the so - called `` _ _ wimp miracle _ _ '' ) . due to their large mass and interaction strength",
    ", the lifetime of these particles would be extremely short and therefore some special symmetry has to be imposed in the model to ensure their stability .",
    "the interest for this class of candidates is due to their potential relation to the electroweak symmetry breaking , which is being tested at the lhc in cern .",
    "in many models trying to make the standard model `` natural '' like , for example , supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , there are particles that could play the role of wimp dark matter candidates .",
    "the wimp searches are important scientific goals of many experiments .",
    "dozens of dedicated laboratory experiments are conducted to detect wimps in the galaxy halo by testing their interaction with nucleons ( _ direct detection experiments _ ) ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "searches for the annihilation products of these particles ( _ indirect detection _ ) are performed by pamela , fermi and other high - energy cosmic missions ( see e.g. reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "no convincing signals has been observed so far in either `` direct '' or `` indirect '' searches .",
    "additionally , no hints of new physics at electroweak scale had turned up at the lhc or in any other experiments .",
    "this makes alternative approaches to the dm problem ever more viable .",
    "another viable generalization of the neutrino dm idea is given by _",
    "sterile neutrino dark matter _",
    "scenario  @xcite , see  @xcite for review .",
    "sterile neutrino is a right - chiral counterpart of the left - chiral neutrinos of the sm ( called ` _ _ active _ _ ' neutrinos in this context ) . adding these particles to the sm lagrangian makes neutrinos massive and",
    "is therefore their existence provides a simple and natural explanation of the observed neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "these particles are singlet leptons because they carry no charges with respect to the standard model gauge groups ( hence the name ) , and therefore along with their yukawa interaction with the active neutrinos ( = ` dirac mass ' ) they can have a majorana mass term ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) .",
    "they interact with the matter via creation of virtual active neutrino ( quadratic mixing ) and in this way they effectively participate in weak reactions ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : n23nu ] ) . at energies much below the masses of the @xmath4 and @xmath5-bosons ,",
    "their interaction can be described by the analog of the fermi theory with the fermi coupling constant @xmath6 suppressed by the active - sterile neutrino mixing angle @xmath7  the ratio of their dirac to majorana masses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - fermi ] ) : @xmath8 ( this mixing can be different for different flavours @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xmath10      it was observed long ago that such particles can be produced in the early universe through mixing with active neutrinos  @xcite and have a correct relic density for any mass  @xcite .",
    "the existence of sterile neutrinos is motivated by the _ observational phenomena beyond the standard model _",
    "( unlike wimps that are motivated first of all by the theoretical considerations of stability of the higgs mass against quantum corrections that could require a fine - tuning of parameters of the model ) .",
    "namely , sterile neutrinos would provide a simple and natural explanation of the _ neutrino flavour oscillations _",
    "however , a _",
    "sterile neutrino would be unable to explain the two observed mass splittings between standard model neutrinos  at least two sterile neutrinos are needed for that .",
    "moreover , should sterile neutrino play the role of dm , its mixing with active neutrinos would be too small to contribute significantly to the flavor oscillations  its life time should be very large and , therefore , interaction strength should be too feeble  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to explain dark matter and neutrino mass ( one for each sm flavor ) , the minimal model should contain 3 right - handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "in such a model , the lowest mass eigen - state of the active neutrinos will be ( almost ) zero and the sum of neutrino masses @xmath11 , where @xmath12 or @xmath13 for normal ( inverted ) hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "this is one of the predictions of such a model .    in spite of the fact that dark matter sterile neutrino plays essentially no role in the neutrino oscillations , the fact that 3 particles are needed to explain _ both _ dark matter and neutrino oscillations is crucial .",
    "as we will see below , primordial properties of sterile neutrino dark matter are determined by two other sterile neutrinos .",
    "if the masses of the two sterile neutrinos , responsible for neutrino oscillations , are below @xmath14 ( mass of @xmath15-quark ) , such particles can be searched with existing experimental techniques  @xcite , see sec .",
    "[ sec : accelerator - searches ] below .",
    "this is a unique situation when one can directly test the nature of neutrino oscillations in ` intensity frontier '  @xcite experiments .",
    "for masses above 2  gev the searches become more difficult ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] for details ) .",
    "it turns out that in the region of masses between @xmath16 and electroweak scale out - of equilibrium reactions with these two sterile neutrinos are capable of generating the observed matter ",
    "antimatter asymmetry of the universe ( baryogenesis )  @xcite .",
    "these observations motivated a lot of recent efforts for developing this model , called the @xmath17msm   _ neutrino minimal standard model _ ( see  @xcite for review ) .",
    "therefore , finding these particles in intensity frontier experiments would provide an unparalleled possibility to test baryogenesis in laboratory .",
    "moreover , if some particles are found in such experiments it will be possible not only to check whether they are responsible for baryogenesis or not , but also unambiguously predict the properties of sterile neutrino dm .    because its interaction with the standard model particles is very feeble , sterile neutrino",
    "does not need to be stable .",
    "the decay channel for sterile neutrinos of all masses is to 3 ( anti)neutrinos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n23nu ] ) .",
    "additional decay channels become kinematically possible .",
    "] however , the most characteristic feature of sterile neutrino dm is its ability to decay to photon and neutrino ( with cosmologically long lifetime )  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] .",
    "the emitted photon is almost mono - energetic ( the width of the dm decay line is determined entirely by the motion of dm particles ) .",
    "although the lifetime of the dm particles turns out to be _ much longer than the age of the universe _ , humongous amount of these particles around us implies that the combined emission may be sizable .    _",
    "if dark matter is made of sterile neutrinos , detecting astrophysical signal from their decay ( the `` indirect detection '' ) may be the only way to identify this particle experimentally .",
    "however , it may be possible to prove the dark matter origin of observed signal unambiguously using its characteristic properties . _    _ in summary _ , one sees that three sterile with the masses below electroweak scale form a minimal testable model that provides a unified description of three major _ observational _ problems `` beyond - the - standard - model ''  @xcite :    neutrino flavour oscillations ;    the absence of primordial anti - matter in the universe ;    existence of dark matter .",
    "the interaction of active neutrinos with primordial plasma at temperatures above few mev ( see  @xcite ) leads to a significant temperature suppression of active - sterile mixing  @xcite at temperatures above a few hundred mev which therefore peaks roughly at  @xcite @xmath18{kev}}\\right)^{1/3}~\\mbox{mev}.    \\label{peak}\\ ] ] sterile neutrinos dm are never in thermal equilibrium ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and their number density is significantly smaller than that of the active neutrinos ( that is why they can account for the observed dm abundance without violating ` tremaine  gunn bound ' ) . in particular , the shape of the primordial momentum distribution of thus produced sterile neutrinos is roughly proportional to that of the active neutrinos  @xcite : @xmath19 where the normalization @xmath20 and where @xmath21 is the temperature of the active neutrinos . ) .",

    "this effect influences the formation of structures .",

    "however , the level of systematics of the _ xmm - newton _ is much higher ( at the level 510% , see e.g.  @xcite ) due to the instrument s degradation with time and variability of the instrumental ( = cosmic - ray induced ) background that constitutes a significant part of a signal in each energy bin ( and becomes a dominant component above few kev ( c.f .",
    "the exposure of ` closed filter ' dataset is @xmath69  ms . as a result",
    ", the usual practice of subtraction of rescaled instrumental background data ( see e.g.  @xcite ) would mean at least @xmath70 times larger errorbars due to the smaller exposure of the instrumental dataset .",
    "moreover , the instrumental component of the _ xmm - newton _ background is self - similar only on average which would introduce additional errors ( at the level of few % , see  @xcite ) .",
    "another standard procedure of working with diffuse sources  subtraction of the ` blank sky ' data will not be applicable in this case as well .",
    "first of all , such a dataset would also contain decaying dark matter line originating from the decays in the milky way halo ( this fact has been exploited before to put bounds on decaying dm in  @xcite ) . secondly ,",
    "subtracting the ` blank sky ' data would again reduce all the advantages of a large dataset by lowering statistics ( as the exposure of the latest blank - sky co - added observations is again of the order of @xmath69  ms ) .",
    "this means that to _ take all the advantages of this long - exposure dataset , one can not use the standard data - processing methods_. therefore , an alternative method of data analysis has to be developed , that has the sensitivity towards the searching for narrow lines at the level , dictated by the statistics of the combined dataset .",
    "the results will be reported in  @xcite .",
    "the estimated level of sensitivity of this method is shown as the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .          really significant progress ( that allows , for example , to cover the whole region of parameter space in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) in searching for decaying dm can not be achieved with the existing instruments by simply increasing the exposure of observations .",
    "indeed , the width of the dm decay line , @xmath71 is determined by the virial velocities of dm particles in halos and ranges from @xmath72 for dwarf spheroidal galaxies to @xmath73 for the milky way - size galaxies to @xmath74 for galaxy clusters .",
    "if the spectral resolution is much bigger than the width of the line , one averages the photons from the line with the background photons over a large energy bin .",
    "this is the case for all existing x - ray missions , whose detectors are based on ccd technology ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) and where the spectral resolution is at the level @xmath75 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : missions ] .",
    "therefore , _ an x - ray spectrometer with the energy resolution at least @xmath76 is crucial for detection of a decaying dm line_.    the technology behind such spectrometers ( known as _ x - ray micro - calorimeters _ , see e.g.  @xcite ) has been actively developed by the high - energy astrophysical community in the last decades .",
    "there is a strong interest for building such a spectrometer , and different versions of high resolution x - ray missions had been proposed in response to the esa and nasa calls ( including the esa s call for fundamental physics roadmap ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "astrophysical interest to x - ray spectrometer is motivated by a number of important applications to observational cosmology , providing crucial insight into the nature of dark matter by studying the structure of the `` cosmic web '' .",
    "in particular ,    search for missing baryons in the cosmic filaments ; through their emission and absorption ;    trace the evolution and physics of clusters out to their formation epoch ;    gamma - ray bursts as a source of backlight to observe the warm - hot intergalactic media in absorption ;    study the evolution of massive star formation using gamma - ray bursts to trace their explosions back to the early epochs of the universe ( @xmath77 ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the first spectrometer based on this technology was flown ( albeit unsuccessfully ) on _ suzaku _ mission  @xcite and another one is being planned for the astro - h  @xcite ( to be launched in 2014 )",
    ". however , currently planned and proposed x - ray micro - calorimeter missions ( astro - h  @xcite , athena  @xcite , origin  @xcite , etc . ) are not optimal for the purpose of decaying dark matter search .",
    "these missions are optimized for the astrophysical goals and have limited field - of - view ( usually , much below @xmath78{deg}^2 $ ] ) , good angular resolution and narrow energy range .    on the contrary ,",
    "the key parameters that determine the sensitivity of the proposed instrument for decaying dark matter search are ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : missions ] ) :    a spectral resolution @xmath79 over the range of energies @xmath80{kev}$ ] ( this is the minimal energy range , that would allow to probe the parameter space of our baseline model , the @xmath17msm ) ;    large ` _ _ grasp _ _ ' @xmath81{cm^2\\times deg^2}$ ] .",
    "there are essentially two possibilities to achieve such a grasp .",
    "one can either launch a non - imaging spectrometer ( with a ` collimator ' having a field - of - view as large as @xmath82{deg}^2 $ ] ) would of course further increase the sensitivity towards the line detection .",
    "however , in this case it would become challenging to identify the nature of the candidate line ( if found ) , as in this case none of the nearby dm dominated objects with large angular size ( andromeda galaxy , large and small magellanic clouds , virgo cluster ) will look like ` hot spots ' of dm decays .",
    "moreover , in this case it will not be possible to build a dm surface brightness profile as one varies the directions off the galactic center and investigate whether it is consistent with dm distribution in the milky way . ] ; or install mirrors ( thus increasing the effective area beyond the geometric size of the detectors , probably to as much as @xmath83{cm^2}$ ] ) .",
    "the latter option allows to have also imaging capabilities , however , it is usually extremely costly to cover the required energy range and to have sufficiently large ( at least @xmath84 ) field of view .",
    "[ fig : missions ] summarizes sensitivity of existing and proposed missions and demonstrates that none of them would provide a sufficient improvement with respect to the existing constraints ( see  @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "currently , there exists a project ( the _ x - ray quantum calorimeter _ , xqc  @xcite ) that can be considered a prototype of the proposed mission .",
    "it has the field of view of about @xmath78{sr}$ ] ( @xmath85{deg^2}$ ] ) , an effective area of @xmath86{cm^2}$ ] and the energy resolution of 10  ev over the energy range 0.1 - 4  kev  @xcite .",
    "] this calorimeter has been flown several times on sounding rockets  @xcite .",
    "although each flight had been very short ( about 100  s ) , it allowed to demonstrate that the milky way emission in the energy range @xmath87{kev}$ ] ( which looks as a continuum in the spectra obtained with x - ray imaging instruments , see e.g.  @xcite is actually a `` forest '' of thin lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : resolved - spectra ] ) .",
    "because of its superior spectral resolution , decaying dm bounds based on the @xmath88  s exposure of the flight of this spectrometer  @xcite are comparable with @xmath89  s of the _ xmm - newton _ exposure  @xcite .",
    "to detect a dark matter decay line , that is much weaker than the lines resolved with the xqc spectrometer , a significantly longer exposure ( @xmath90{year}$ ] ) would be required . the requirement to keep the cryostat of such a spectrometer in the stable regime , means that one can not use the sounding rockets , but rather needs to use a satellite ( probably , staying in low earth orbit , unlike _ xmm - newton _ or _ chandra _ ) .",
    "the project therefore becomes a small - to - medium scale cosmic mission .",
    "finally , several words should be said about laboratory searches of dm sterile neutrinos . as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] demonstrates , their mixing angle is always smaller than @xmath91 ( even for the lightest admissible masses of @xmath92 ) .",
    "this makes their laboratory searches extremely challenging .",
    "one possibility would be to measure the event - by - event kinematics of @xmath2-decay products  @xcite .",
    "this experiment , however , is plagued by the bremsstrahlung emission of the finite state electrons that changes their energy .",
    "other possibilities of searches for the kev - scale sterile neutrinos are discussed e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "all these experiments require essentially background - free regime and it is not clear whether any of them can realistically touch cosmologically interesting region of parameters of sterile neutrino .",
    "although only one sterile neutrino plays the role of dark matter , the fact that three of them are needed to explain _ both _ dark matter and neutrino oscillations is crucial as these two particles set up _ the initial conditions _ for sterile neutrino dm production and affect their primordial properties  @xcite .",
    "if the masses of sterile neutrinos responsible for neutrino oscillations are below electroweak scale ( as it is the case in the @xmath17msm ) , such particles can be found in ` intensity frontier ' experiments , opening the road for the experimental resolution of three major observational problems ` beyond - the - standard - model ' : neutrino flavor oscillations , matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe and dark matter .",
    "the idea that the sm can be extended in the neutrino sector by adding several relatively light neutral fermions was discussed intensively since the 1980s .",
    "two distinct strategies have been used for these searches . the first one is related to their production .",
    "the neutral leptons participate in all reactions the ordinary neutrinos do with a probability suppressed by their mixing angles with active neutrinos .",
    "since sterile neutrinos are massive , the kinematics of 2-body decays @xmath93 , @xmath94 or 3-body decays @xmath95 changes when @xmath96 is replaced by an ordinary neutrino  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of _ kinematics _ of rare meson decays can constrain the strength of the coupling of heavy leptons .",
    "this strategy has been used for the search of neutral leptons in the past , where the spectrum of electrons or muons originating in decays @xmath97 and @xmath98 mesons has been studied  ( @xcite see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the second strategy is to look for the decays of sterile neutrinos{mev}$ ] ( k meson ) , between @xmath99{mev}$ ] and @xmath13 gev ( d - mesons ) , between @xmath13 and @xmath100 gev ( b - mesons ) , and above @xmath100 gev .",

    "heavy mesons ( and baryons ) are produced in `` fixed target experiments '' ( beam of energetic protons hitting a target ) .",
