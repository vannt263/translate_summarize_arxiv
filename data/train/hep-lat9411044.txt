    "the main motivation of this work is understanding the mechanism of colour confinement in qcd .",
    "an appealing possibility is dual superconductivity of the ground state@xcite .",
    "`` dual '' means that the role of electric and magnetic quantities is interchanged with respect to ordinary superconductors : the chromoelectric field acting between a @xmath1 pair is then channeled by dual meissner effect into abrikosov flux tubes , which behave as strings@xcite .",
    "such tubes have been observed in lattice configurations@xcite .",
    "the question is : can we directly detect dual superconductivity on the lattice ? the problem is always reduced to a @xmath0 problem by the so called abelian projection@xcite : our task is then to characterize dual superconductivity of a @xmath0 system , and to find an unambigous way to detect it .",
    "dual superconductivity is the spontaneous breaking  la higgs of the @xmath0 symmetry related to the conservation of magnetic charge : monopole charges condense in the vacuum ( in the same way as cooper pairs do in ordinary superconductors ) , making it @xmath0 non invariant@xcite .",
    "if the vacuum is @xmath0 invariant the vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) of any operator with non zero magnetic charge is zero .",
    "spontaneous breaking of @xmath0 is therefore signalled by non vanishing _",
    "vev _ of any magnetically charged operator .",
    "vev _ is called a disorder parameter in the language of statistical mechanics@xcite . a rigorous proof exists@xcite that in compact @xmath0 on the lattice monopoles",
    "do condense for @xmath2 smaller than some critical value @xmath3 : the proof requires a specific form of the action ( villain ) and infinite volume , to perform the transformation to dual variables@xcite .",
    "the difficulties with finite volume were already noticed in ref@xcite for the ising model . we have constructed a disorder parameter which coincides with that of ref@xcite for villain action and infinite volume , but can be used with any form of the action and can detect dual superconductivity in finite lattices .",
    "as magnetically charged operator we shall use a creation operator for monopoles , defined as follows@xcite . let @xmath4 be the usual conjugate momentum to the field variables",
    "@xmath5 . then the operator @xmath6 \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] creates a monopole if @xmath7 is the vector potential produced in @xmath8 by a monopole of charge @xmath9 sitting in @xmath10 .",
    "putting the string along the 3 axis , and @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath8 @xmath13 @xmath10 , @xmath14 in fact @xmath15 is a translation operator of the field , as is easily seen in the schrdinger picture @xmath16 in the same language if @xmath17 the operator @xmath18 \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] defines a gauge transformation latexmath:[\\[\\gamma(t)|a_i({\\bf x},t)\\rangle =    define _ vev _ of @xmath15 in the euclidean region with feynman path integral can be checked on a system of free photons , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it amounts to define the _ vev _ of the operator @xmath15",
    "as@xcite @xmath20 } { \\displaystyle \\int\\!{\\cal d } a_\\mu{\\rm exp}\\left[-\\beta ( s + s_g)\\right ] } \\label{eq:5}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 @xmath22 is the action and @xmath23 is any gauge configuration subjected to the condition that @xmath24 the factor @xmath25 in the second term of the exponents come from the factor @xmath26 in the magnetic charge of the monopole times the @xmath26 coming from the usual rescaling of the fields , the same which produces the factor @xmath25 in front of @xmath22 . for free photons ( or for @xmath27 ) @xmath22 @xmath12 @xmath28 , the integral ( [ eq:5 ] ) is gaussian and @xmath29\\label{eq:7}\\\\ & = & c { \\rm exp}\\left[-\\beta\\ln(\\frac{v}{a^3})\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30 is some ultraviolet cutoff . @xmath31 as @xmath32 or at fixed @xmath30 ( e.g. on a lattice ) as @xmath33 on the lattice .",
    "our disorder parameter becomes an order parameter of the dual theory , i.e. exactly zero for @xmath34 , only in the limit @xmath33 : with a finite number of degrees of freedom , being analytic in @xmath25 , it can not be zero for @xmath27 , since then it would be identically zero@xcite .",
    "what is really important , however , in order to detect superconductivity , is to show that it is different from zero below @xmath3 , independent of the finiteness of the volume . to accomplish this",
    "we will compute @xmath35 not directly , but through @xmath36 the label on the right of the brackets indicates the action used to compute the average : eq.([eq:8 ] ) directly follows from eq.([eq:5 ] ) . since @xmath37 , in terms of @xmath38",
    "@xmath39 0.2 in        * it solves the problem of fluctuations produced by the fact that @xmath35 , being the average of the exponent of an extensive quantity , has a non gaussian distribution@xcite . *",
    "it eliminates problems of boundary conditions in the definition of @xmath35@xcite . indeed the r.h.s . of eq.([eq:8 ] ) is the average of an extensive quantity , and is sensitive to the bulk properties of the system at least for @xmath41 , i.e. in the presence of a mass gap .",
    "computing @xmath35 with periodic and antiperiodic b.c .",
    "gives the same result within errors .    to be rigorous we should have started from the correlation function betwen a monopole - antimonopole pair , defining @xmath35 through the cluster property @xmath42 putting @xmath43 @xmath44 the cluster property reads then , for @xmath45 @xmath46 however if the correlation length is much smaller than the lattice size , measuring @xmath47 or @xmath48 are equivalent procedures .",
    "at large @xmath25 s @xmath40 agrees with eq.([eq:7 ] ) . a large negative peak at @xmath53 , whose area is an increasing function of @xmath54 , signals a vanishing @xmath55 .",
    "for @xmath56 @xmath35 becomes volume independent at sufficiently large volumes , showing unambigously monopole condensation .",
