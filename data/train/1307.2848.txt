    "inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , i.e. the process @xmath5 , where a lepton interacts with a hadronic target @xmath6 and only the scattered lepton is detected , has been the subject of intense experimental investigation in the last decades . through these processes",
    "it has become possible to describe the longitudinal ( with respect to the direction of the high energy beam ) momentum and helicity distributions of the partons , in both proton ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and nuclear targets ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . despite of these efforts",
    "it is nowadays clear that the answers to a few crucial questions can be hardly found through dis experiments . among them , we remind at least three challenging problems , which are related to the subject of this paper : @xmath7 the fully quantitative explanation of the so - called emc effect ( i.e. the modification of the nucleon partonic structure due to the nuclear medium , observed long time ago @xcite ) ; @xmath8 the solution of the so - called `` spin crisis '' , i.e. the fact that the nucleon spin does not originate from only the spins of its valence quarks , already reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ; @xmath9 the measurement of the chiral - odd parton distribution function ( pdf ) called transversity ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for an introduction to this issue ) , related to the probability distribution to find a transversely - polarized quark inside a transversely - polarized nucleon , that allows one to complete the leading - twist description of a polarized nucleon , unfortunately not measurable in dis .    to clarify the above mentioned problems",
    ", a new direction has been taken .",
    "special efforts on both experimental and theoretical sides have been focused on exclusive and semi - inclusive deep inelastic ( sidis ) measurements , in order to go beyond the inclusive processes . in the sidis reactions , besides the scattered lepton , a hadron is detected in coincidence , see fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "if the detected hadron is fast , one can expect that it originates from the fragmentation of the active , highly off - mass - shell quark , after absorbing the virtual photon .",
    "hence , the detected hadron brings information about the motion of quarks in the parent nucleon before interacting with the photon , and in particular on their transverse motion .",
    "therefore , through sidis reactions , one can access the so - called transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) establishing a framework where one can develop new tools for gathering a wealth of information on the partonic dynamics , more rich than in the collinear case .",
    "for instance , beside the main issue of tmds , one should remind that the detected hadron carries also information on the hadronization mechanism , itself .",
    "the sidis cross sections can be parametrized , at leading twist , by six parton distributions ; this number reduces to three in dis and increases to eight once the so - called time - reversal odd tmds are considered @xcite . in view of this",
    ", sidis reactions play a crucial role for addressing the issue of the chiral - odd transversity , since it is necessary to flip the quark chirality for observing this tmd .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that in order to experimentally investigate the wide field of tmds , one should measure cross - section asymmetries , using different combinations of beam and target polarizations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "to make complete the study of tmds one should achieve a sound flavor decomposition , that can be obtained once neutron data become available . to this end , it should be pointed out that the investigation of the neutron content is highly favored by choosing a polarized @xmath0he as a target , as discussed in detail in what follows .",
    "as it is well known , free neutron targets are not available and nuclei have to be used as effective neutron targets .",
    "due to its peculiar spin structure ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , polarized @xmath0he has been used extensively in dis studies . in particular , procedures to extract the neutron spin - dependent structure functions from @xmath0he data , taking properly into account the fermi - motion and binding effects , have been proposed and successfully applied @xcite .",
    "such a detailed description of the target nucleus was accomplished in plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) by using the so - called spin - dependent spectral function , whose diagonal elements yield the probability distribution to find a nucleon with a given momentum , missing energy and polarization inside the nucleus .",
    "it is worth noting that , within pwia , accurate @xmath0he spin - dependent spectral functions , based on realistic few - body calculations ( for both the target nucleus and the spectator pair in the final state ) , have been built in the last twenty years @xcite .",
    "it is very important to notice that the spin - dependent spectral function contains two contributions : one does not depend upon the polarization of the target nucleus , @xmath10 , and the other does .",
    "this is the term that enters the description of the asymmetries of the cross sections we are going to investigate , and for the sake of brevity we call it spin - dependent contribution .",
    "the question whether similar procedures , based on the pwia spectral function , can be extended to sidis is of great relevance , due to several experiments that exploit a polarized @xmath0he target ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , for investigating the transverse degrees of freedom of the neutron . for instance",
    ", a wide interest has arisen about the possibility to measure , using transversely polarized @xmath0he , azimuthal single - spin asymmetries of the neutron , which are sensitive to i ) the so - called time - reversal odd tmds ( such as the sivers @xcite and boer - mulders @xcite functions ) and ii ) fragmentation functions ( such as the collins function @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it is the existence of final state interactions ( fsi ) at leading twist that allows for time - reversal odd tmds  @xcite .",
    "the first measurements of these functions , obtained through sidis off transversely polarized proton and deuteron targets , have produced a puzzling experimental scenario @xcite .",
    "therefore , with the aim of extracting the neutron information to shed some light on the problem , a measurement of sidis off transversely polarized @xmath0he has been addressed @xcite , and an experiment , planned to measure azimuthal asymmetries in the production of leading @xmath11 from transversely polarized @xmath0he , has been already completed at jefferson lab ( jlab ) , with a beam energy of 6 gev @xcite . notice that a new experiment has been planned and it will be soon performed after completing the 12 gev upgrade @xcite .    in view of these experimental efforts , a realistic pwia analysis of sidis off transversely polarized @xmath0he has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . a spin - dependent spectral function @xcite , corresponding to the nucleon - nucleon av18 interaction @xcite , has been used for",
    "a realistic description of the nuclear dynamics and the crucial issue of extracting the neutron information from @xmath0he data has been discussed .",
    "it was found that for sidis reactions , where both parton distributions and fragmentation functions are involved , one can safely extend a model - independent extraction procedure , based on the realistic evaluation of the proton and neutron polarizations in @xmath0he @xcite and widely used in inclusive dis , given its ability to take into account effectively the momentum and energy distributions of the polarized bound nucleons in @xmath0he .",
    "however , in a sidis process the effect of fsi can not be neglected `` a priori '' and it needs to be seriously investigated",
    ". this will be the aim of the present paper , where a distorted spin - dependent spectral function is introduced , by applying a generalized eikonal approximation ( gea ) , already successfully exploited for describing unpolarized sidis off nuclei @xcite .    .",
    "the target @xmath6 can be either longitudinally or transversely polarized . ]    concerning the mechanism of sidis off nuclear targets , one can distinguish at least two , rather different , sets of reactions :    a.   the most familiar , _ standard _",
    "process , where the fast hadron is detected mostly in the forward direction .",
    "this implies that the hadron was produced by the leading quark .",
    "therefore such reactions can be used to investigate tmds inside the hit nucleon ; b.   the _ spectator _ sidis , in which there is no detection of any produced ( fast ) hadrons , while the remaining , slow @xmath12 nucleon system , acting as a spectator of the photon - nucleon interaction , is detected .",
    "it has been shown that spectator sidis can be very useful to investigate the unpolarized deep inelastic structure functions @xmath13 of a bound nucleon , and therefore to clarify the origin of the emc effect @xcite . at the same time",
    ", this process can provide also useful information on quark hadronization in medium , complementary to the ones obtained so far by the analysis of the standard sidis process .",
    "notably , including polarization degrees of freedom would provide information on the spin - dependent structure functions @xmath14 for bound nucleons and , ultimately , on the origin of the polarized emc effect .    from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "an important observation is that in both processes , the standard and spectator sidiss , nuclear effects can be described by the same quantity : a _ distorted spin - dependent spectral function _",
    ", once fsi are taken into account . with respect to the one governing the dis reactions",
    ", this novel distribution function is a more complicated object , since , besides the momentum , energy and polarization distributions of the nucleons in @xmath0he , it includes also effects of fsi between the produced particles",
    ". a thorough knowledge of the distorted spin - dependent spectral function would allow one to reliably separate the effects due to the nuclear structure from the ones involving tmds , in the experimental cross sections . since nuclear effects are expected to be similar in both sidis reactions , the spectral function and fsi effects will be studied by considering , as a first step , the simplest process , i.e. , the _ spectator _ sidis , described by only two structure functions of the nucleon .",
    "then , one can proceed with the more complicated and involved _ standard _ sidis , focusing on the extraction of quark tmds inside the neutron , i.e. the needed ingredients for making complete the flavor decomposition .",
    "aim of our paper , is the evaluation of the distorted spin - dependent spectral function of @xmath0he , taking into account , through a generalized eikonal approximation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the fsi between the @xmath12 spectator and the quark debris , produced after dis off an internal nucleon , with given polarization .",
    "the application to the spectator sidis reaction , with the detection of a deuteron in the final state , represents a first play - ground of our approach . as already mentioned , besides its pedagogical relevance",
    ", spectator sidis reactions could provide unique information on the polarized emc effect and on the hadronization mechanism of the quark debris during its propagation through the nuclear medium , depending upon the kinematical region one chooses .",
    "in particular , once a final deuteron is detected , one can extract information on the proton . to play the same game for the neutron",
    ", one should consider a polarized @xmath0h target , and still detecting a final deuteron .",
    "this sidis reaction could seem out of the present range of experimental possibilities , but we can not refrain to mention that valuable achievements have been reached in the last decade in dealing with such a difficult target , as demonstrated by the final approval ( with scientific rating a ) of an experiment dedicated to dis by a @xmath0h target , at jlab @xcite . finally , it should be pointed out that the generalization to other sidis processes is rather straightforward , even if very heavy from the numerical - evaluation side , and it will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the basic formalism for the cross section , valid for any sidis process and define the main quantities relevant for the calculations within the pwia framework . in section iii , the spectator sidis reaction @xmath15 is investigated in detail , i ) introducing the distorted spin - dependent spectral function , that represents the main ingredient of our method for implementing fsi effects , through a generalized eikonal approximation , and ii ) adopting an effective cross section obtained from a model of hadronization of the quark debris . in section",

    "this leads to a further reduction , by a factor @xmath380 .",
    "therefore , the perpendicular component of the spectral function can be safely neglected in the spectator sidis by a proper choice of kinematics .",

    "in particular , if one considers a standard sidis reaction , i.e. with a fast hadron detected , and a transversely - polarized @xmath0he target , i.e. @xmath381 , one should pay attention to fsi effects , since the contribution of the perpendicular components to the asymmetries can be , in principle , sizable .",
    "the above mentioned sidis process is relevant for extracting the neutron transversity , but also collins and sivers functions , and therefore it has to be carefully investigated .",

    "moreover , in standard sidis , the @xmath12 nucleus is not detected and one needs to integrate over all the values of the missing momentum , see eq .",
    "( [ crosa-2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , since in the present paper we have evaluated the diagonal @xmath382 , one can infer that there should be kinematical ranges where fsi could modify the pwia cross sections , but not necessarily the asymmetries .",

    "( [ figsparperp ] ) , where the diagonal @xmath383 is shown for the parallel and perpendicular kinematics , indicates the kinematical region where one should expect large fsi effects , ( remind that the diagonal @xmath384 is always quite small ) .",

    "in summary , we introduced a novel nuclear distribution function for investigating the semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering of polarized leptons by a polarized @xmath50 nucleus .",
    "such a distribution function , the distorted spin - dependent spectral function , has been evaluated for an @xmath50 nucleus , by using the three - body wave function @xcite corresponding to the realistic av18 nn interaction @xcite .",
    "our calculations should make more reliable the extraction of information on a bound nucleon , with a particular aim of providing a refined treatment of a polarized @xmath0he target , that , as well - known , represents an effective neutron target , and plays a fundamental role for obtaining observables for the neutron like i ) transversity and ii ) collins and sivers functions , i.e. the main physical motivations of forthcoming experiments with a transversely - polarized @xmath0he @xcite .    as a first step",
    ", we gave the formal expression of the nuclear tensor in terms of the nuclear overlaps , i.e. the transition amplitude between the target wave function and a state given by the cartesian product of a nucleon plane - wave and the fully - interacting state composed by the remaining @xmath12 nucleons .",
    "within such a formalism the nuclear tensor can be factorized in a nucleonic tensor and the proper combination of the above mentioned overlaps , that in turn yield the well - known pwia spin - dependent spectral function .",
    "the fsi effects have been introduced through a generalized eikonal approximation , successfully applied to the description of unpolarized spectator sidis processes @xcite .",
    "the spectator sidis reactions , where a slowly - recoiling @xmath12 systems is detected in coincidence with the scattered lepton , differently from the standard sidis , where a fast hadron , produced after the virtual - photon absorption by a quark inside the bound nucleon is detected , have been chosen as a test - ground for our approach .",
    "in particular , we have applied our formalism to the reaction @xmath386 , with a longitudinally - polarized target .",
    "the investigation of the spin - dependent spectral function needed for describing the previous spectator sidis has allowed to single out a kinematical region where the fsi can be minimized , and therefore one can safely extract the polarized structure function of a bound proton , @xmath315 , and a region where the fsi has a maximal effect .",
    "there , one can address the issue of the hadronization in a nuclear medium .",
    "the analysis of this spectator sidis , though less complicate and less numerically - demanding than the standard one , provide valuable information on a nucleon bound in a nucleus , shedding some light on the polarized emc effect , and moreover allows us to calibrate our approach for the next application to the standard sidis by a transversely - polarized @xmath387 . in this case",
    "we have to extended the calculation of the distorted spin - dependent spectral function to the off - diagonal terms , i.e. to the combination of the nuclear overlaps corresponding to target states with different spin projections , and then to integrate over a suitable ( given by the experimental kinematics ) range of missing momentum and energies of the @xmath12 system .",
