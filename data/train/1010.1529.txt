    "significant fraction of isolated white dwarfs form with strong magnetic fields .",
    "these high - field magnetic white dwarfs ( hfmwd ) , the majority of which were discovered via the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , comprise @xmath010% of all isolated white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "surface field strengths range from a few to slightly less than a thousand megagauss ( mg ) while the bulk of the isolated wd population have measured weak fields or non - detection upper limits of typically @xmath1  g @xcite .    in wd - binary systems ,",
    "the companion s surface is an equipotential . in tight binaries",
    ", this equipotential extends toward the wd , leading to mass transfer from the companion onto the wd , a process called `` roche - lobe overflow . '' among systems such as these , a possibly even larger fraction of the wd primaries are highly magnetic ( i.e. , @xmath025% of cataclysmic variables ; @xcite ) . magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are generally divided into two classes : am herculis ( polars ) and dq herculis ( intermediate polars ) . for reviews on",
    "am her and dq her systems see @xcite and @xcite",
    ". generally , am her systems are those in which both components of the binary are synchronously rotating at the orbital period . in this scenario ,",
    "the formation of an accretion disk is prevented and material is funneled onto the wd via the magnetosphere .",
    "polars have strong magnetic fields ( @xmath0@xmath2 g ) , copious x - ray emission and stable pulsations in their lightcurves .",
    "on the other hand , dq her systems ( intermediate polars ) are not synchronously locked and have weaker magnetic fields than their polar counterparts , often by an order of magnitude or more . for these systems , an accretion disk forms from which the wd is spun up .",
    "remarkably , _ not a single _ observed close , detached binary system ( in which the primary is a wd and the companion is a low - mass main - sequence star ) contains a hfmwd @xcite . if the magnetic field strengths of white dwarfs were independent of binary interactions , then the observed distribution of isolated wds should be similar to those in detached binaries .",
    "in particular , within 20 pc , there are 109 known wds ( 21 of which have a non - degenerate companion ) , and sdss has identified 149 hfmwds ( _ none _ of which has a non - degenerate companion ) . assuming binomial statistics , the maximum probability of obtaining samples",
    "at least this different from the same underlying population is @xmath3 , suggesting at the 6.2-@xmath4 level that the two populations are different ( for details on this kind of calculation , see appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , sdss identified 1253 wd+m - dwarf binaries ( _ none _ of which are magnetic ) .",
    "as was previously pointed out , this suggests that the presence or absence of binarity is crucial in influencing whether a hfmwd results @xcite .",
    "these results initially seem to indicate that hfmwds preferentially form when isolated . however , unless there is a mechanism by which very distant companions prevent the formation of a strong magnetic field , a more natural explanation is that highly - magnetized white dwarfs became that way by engulfing ( and removing ) their companions .    in the binary scenario ,",
    "the progenitors of hfmwds are those systems that undergo a common envelope ( ce ) phase during post - ms evolution .",
    "in particular , magnetic cvs may be the progeny of common envelope systems that almost merge but eject the envelope and produce a close binary .",
    "subsequent orbital reduction via gravitational radiation and tidal forces turn detached systems into those which undergo roche - lobe overflow . for ces",
    "in which the companion is not massive enough to eject the envelope and leave a tight post - ce binary , the companion is expected to merge with the core .",
    "it was suggested that these systems may be the progenitors of isolated hfmwds @xcite .    in this paper , we calculate the magnetic fields generated during the common envelope phase .",
    "we focus on low - mass companions embedded in the envelope of a post - ms giant . during in - spiral",
    ", the companion transfers orbital energy and angular momentum , resulting in differential rotation inside the ce . coupled with convection , a transient @xmath5 dynamo amplifies the magnetic field at the interface between the convective and radiative zones where the strongest shear is available .",
    "the fields produced from this interface dynamo are transient and unlikely to reach the white dwarf surface with sufficient strength to explain hfmwd observations .",
    "if , however , the companion tidally disrupts , the resultant super - eddington accretion disk can amplify magnetic fields via a disk dynamo .",
    "the disk - generated fields are strong ( @xmath6 mg ) and accretion provides a natural mechanism with which to transport the fields to the wd surface . for a range of disrupted - companion masses ,",
    "the fields generated in the disk are sufficient to explain the range of observed hfmwds .",
    "common envelopes are often invoked to explain short period systems in which one component of the binary is a compact star @xcite .",
    "the immersion of a companion in a ce with a post - main sequence star can occur via direct engulfment or through orbital decay due to tidal dissipation in the giant s envelope @xcite .",
    "once engulfed , the companion in - spirals due to hydrodynamic drag until it either survives ( ejects the envelope leaving a post - ce close binary ) or is destroyed .",
    "while ces can form for various mass - ratio binaries , we focus on low - mass stellar and substellar companions such that the remnant system is expected to be an isolated white dwarf .",
    "since low - mass companions do not release enough orbital energy to eject the envelope , as the orbital separation is reduced , the differential gravitational force due to the proto - wd tidally shreds the companion .",
    "the disrupted companion then forms a disk inside the ce that subsequently accretes onto the proto - wd @xcite . for more detail on the onset and dynamics of the ce phase for post - ms giants and low - mass companions ( i.e. low , mass - ratio binaries ) ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as a consequence of common envelope evolution , the transfer of orbital energy and angular momentum during in - spiral generates strong shear . coupled with convection , shear leads to large - scale magnetic field amplification via an @xmath5 dynamo . during in - spiral , the free energy in differential rotation available to the dynamo is proportional to the companion mass . in general , the more massive the companion , the more free energy in differential rotation @xcite .",
    "the dynamo converts free energy in differential rotation into magnetic energy and therefore , strong shear leads to strong magnetic fields .",
    "some investigations of the dynamo in this context have imposed a velocity field to determine what steady - state magnetic field might arise if the velocity were steadily driven @xcite . however , as the magnetic field amplifies , differential rotation decreases . in general , for systems in which shear is not resupplied , a transient dynamo and decay of the magnetic field result @xcite .",
    "this scenario was investigated as a way to generate the strong fields necessary to power bipolar outflows in post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) and planetary nebulae ( pne ) @xcite . a similar , but weaker , dynamo ( akin to the solar dynamo )",
    "may operate in isolated red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch stars @xcite .    here , we investigate two scenarios for magnetic field generation during a ce phase between a post - ms giant and a low - mass companion .",
    "first , we calculate the magnetic fields at the interface between the convective and radiative zones in the ce ( hereafter referred to as the envelope dynamo scenario ) and show that this scenario , while potentially viable under special circumstances , is unlikely in general to explain the origin of hfmwds . as an alternative , we estimate the magnetic fields generated in the disk of a tidally disrupted companion around the proto - wd .",
    "the disk - generated fields naturally accrete onto the wd surface and are sufficiently strong to match observations .",
    "the shear profile in a giant star that is produced by a low - mass companion s ce - induced in - spiral leads to a dynamo in the presence of the turbulent convective zone .",
    "the field primarily amplifies at @xmath7 , the interface between the convective and radiative regions .",
    "the back - reaction of field - amplification on the shear is included with differential rotation and rotation depleting via loss of poynting flux and turbulent dissipation .",
    "for the precise equations solved , generic features of envelope dynamos , and a pictorial representation of the dynamo geometry in isolated stellar and ce settings see @xcite . here",
    "we calculate an upper limit to the magnetic field that may be generated by this mechanism , by taking the shear profile in the stellar envelope to be keplerian ( which produces stronger shear than could possibly be maintained in a spherical - hydrostatic star ) .    before presenting details of these calculations , we note a few generic features of this type of scenario that might make the envelope dynamo an unlikely explanation of hfmwds , irrespective of details .",
    "there are a few reasons why a field generated at the radiative - convective boundary may not be able to produce strongly magnetized material in the vicinity of the wd .",
    "first , as shown below , a robust upper limit to the magnitude of the envelope dynamo generated field is a few times @xmath8  g. to explain megagauss fields at the wd surface , this requires an inwardly increasing gradient of @xmath9 ( e.g.  via field amplification from flux freezing ) , which might lead the highest - field regions to rise buoyantly , therefore never reaching the wd surface .",
    "second , since the envelope is transient ( operates for @xmath0100 years ) and the typical agb lifetime is @xmath0@xmath10 years , the envelope would need to be ejected at the time of formation of a hfmwd . without fine tuning , this results in a tight , post - ce binary with an under - massive white dwarf  the exact opposite of the observed hfmwds . finally , even if the field could penetrate to the wd surface",
    ", some mass would need to remain and/or fallback during envelope ejection to anchor the field .",
    "a further subtlety is that the transport of magnetic flux into the radiative layer is likely to involve not merely isotropic diffusion but anisotropic diffusion , as a downward pumping of magnetic flux involves anisotropic convection .",
    "we are led to what seems to be a more natural formation explanation , which is described in the next section .",
    "nevertheless , despite the aforementioned potential difficulties , we now investigate the viability of the envelope dynamo scenario .",
    "our stellar evolution models were computed using the `` evolve zero - age main sequence '' ( ez ) code @xcite.townsend / static.php?ref = ez - web ] we employ a zero - age main - sequence progenitor of 3  @xmath11 , with solar metallicity at the tip of the agb . under the assumption of keplerian rotation ,",
    "the saturated toroidal field strength at the base of the 3-@xmath11 progenitor s convective zone ( @xmath12  cm ) is roughly @xmath13  g. to survive past the pn stage , the fields must reach the wd surface ( which is the core of the agb star , a distance @xmath14 interior to the base of the convective zone ; see fig .  3 of @xcite for a pictorial representation ) , anchor , and sustain or induce a field in the wd .",
    "the latter scenario has been investigated by @xcite , who conclude that an ordered external field ( potentially generated from a dynamo ) can induce a surface field on the wd that decays to a few percent of its initial value after a million years .    for the fields to reach the wd surface ,",
    "radially inward diffusion of magnetic flux must act on a faster timescale than magnetic buoyancy , which transports flux outward .",
    "the buoyant rise velocity , @xmath15 , is found by equating the upward buoyancy force on a flux tube to the downward viscous drag , thereby obtaining the upward terminal velocity .",
    "it may be represented as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the alfvn velocity , @xmath18 is the convective fluid velocity , @xmath19 is the flux tube radius , @xmath20 is a pressure scale height , and @xmath21 is a dimensionless quantity of order unity @xcite . the time to buoyantly rise a distance @xmath22 from @xmath23 , assuming @xmath24 , is @xmath25 years .",
    "the diffusion timescale to traverse a distance @xmath22 , given a turbulent diffusivity @xmath26 , is @xmath27 and must be less than the buoyant - rise time @xmath28 .",
    "this implies a constraint on the turbulent diffusivity : @xmath29 . for @xmath30",
    "cm , the buoyant - rise velocity of a @xmath31-g flux tube in an agb star with @xmath32 g @xmath33 , requires a diffusivity of at least a few times @xmath34  @xmath35  s@xmath36 ; a very large and physically unlikely value .",
    "note however that if weaker fields are generated , the requirement on the diffusivity would lower correspondingly .",
    "furthermore , during one cycle half - period @xmath37 ( defined as the time for one reversal of the field ) , magnetic flux of a given sign ( positive or negative ) can diffuse into the radiative layer .",
    "years ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that while the radiative layer is convectively stable it may still possess non - negligible turbulence . ] after reversal , field of the opposite sign amplifies and diffuses in the radiative layer .",
    "therefore , the diffusion timescale must not be greater than the cycle half - period : @xmath38 .",
    "this implies another a theoretical constraint on the turbulent diffusivity for consistency of our dynamo model , namely @xmath39 .",
    "this latter constraint yields @xmath40  @xmath41  s@xmath36 .",
    "a subtlety is that the transport would not be a strictly isotropic diffusion but could be the result of down pumping by anisotropic convection @xcite .",
    "one way to infer the turbulent diffusivity in evolved stars is to note that isotopic anomalies in low - mass red giant branch and agb stars require that material from the base of the convective zone be transported to near the h - burning shell , processed , and returned to the convective envelope @xcite .",
    "this so - called `` cool bottom processing '' ( cbp ) is thought to be magnetically driven @xcite . in the magnetic mixing scenario , a lower bound on the turbulent diffusivity is @xmath0@xmath42 @xmath41 s@xmath36 @xcite . while the actual diffusion coefficients in evolved star interiors are unknown , the values inferred from cbp are more than an order of magnitude lower than what are required for the envelope dynamo scenario to transport @xmath010@xmath43-g fields all the way to the wd surface .",
    "higher field strengths ( in particular , @xmath0 mg fields ) lead to shorter buoyant - rise times and smaller cycle half - periods , and therefore require even greater diffusivity . in short , a substantial macroscopic diffusivity",
    "would be needed to transport megagauss fields to the wd surface in agb stars .",
    "we presently do not have independent constraints on these coefficients .",
    "if the field generated in the envelope can not diffuse to the wd surface , an alternative possibility is amplification in an accretion disk that forms when the companion is tidally disrupted inside the common envelope @xcite . as shown below",
    ", this scenario is attractive because it provides a natural mechanism for transporting the field to the proto - wd surface .",
    "we consider disks formed from companions spanning the range from sub - jupiter - mass planets ( see below ) to brown dwarfs to low - mass stars ( i.e. @xmath44 between @xmath0@xmath45 and a few times @xmath46 ) . is the mass of jupiter .",
    "this classification as planet or brown dwarf is based solely on mass @xcite ] tidal disruption of the companion results in formation of a disk inside the agb star .",
    "this occurs at the tidal shredding radius , which we estimate as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath44 are the radius and mass of the companion and @xmath49 is the stellar mass interior to @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we note that , since planetary and low - mass stellar companions to solar - type stars are significantly more plentiful than brown dwarfs @xcite , disks at the upper or lower mass range may be more common than those in the intermediate mass range .",
    "the disk is ionized and susceptible to the development of magnetized turbulence ( e.g.  via the magneto - rotational instability @xcite ) .",
    "accretion towards the central proto - wd occurs on a viscous timescale given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the keplerian orbital period at radius @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the effective kinematic viscosity , @xmath55 is the disk scaleheight , @xmath56 is the midplane soundspeed , @xmath57 is the keplerian orbital frequency , and @xmath58 is the dimensionsless shakura - sunyaev parameter that characterizes the efficiency of angular momentum transport @xcite .",
    "the initial accretion rate can be approximated as @xmath59 where we have scaled @xmath48 to the radius of jupiter is the radius of jupiter .",
    "note that @xmath48 depends only weakly on mass for the companions we consider . ] and have scaled @xmath60 to a large value @xmath61 because the disk can not cool efficiently at such high accretion rates and would be geometrically thick . since the companions under consideration lead to disks much more dense than the stellar envelope",
    ", it is reasonable to ignore any interaction between the disk and the star",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : mdot0 ] ) illustrates that for @xmath62 , and for typical values of @xmath63 , @xmath64 is @xmath03 to 9 orders of magnitude larger than the eddington accretion rate of the proto - wd ( i.e. , @xmath65  yr@xmath36 ) . at first",
    ", it might seem apparent that inflow of mass onto the wd surface would be inhibited by radiation pressure in such a scenario . however , this neglects the fact that , at sufficiently high accretion rates , photons are trapped and advected to small radii faster than they can diffuse out @xcite . in this ` hyper - critical ' regime , accretion is possible even when @xmath66 .",
    "we evaluate the possibility of hyper - critical accretion by estimating the radius interior to which the inward accretion timescale , @xmath67 , is less than the timescale for photons to diffuse out of the disk midplane , @xmath68 ( which is approximately @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the vertical optical depth @xcite ) .",
    "this `` trapping radius '' is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the opacity .",
    "an important quantity is the ratio of the trapping radius to the outer disk radius @xmath50 ( coincident with the tidal shredding radius ) : @xmath73 where we have used equation ( [ eq : mdot0 ] ) and scaled @xmath72 to the electron scattering opacity @xmath74 @xmath35 g@xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath75 , then @xmath76 and photons are advected with the matter .    from equation ( [ eq : trap_ratio ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "this implies that photon pressure will be unable to halt accretion initially and that the local energy released by accretion must be removed by advection @xcite .",
    "advection acts like a conveyor belt , nominally carrying the gas to small radii as its angular momentum is removed .",
    "if , however , there is no sink for the hot gas , this conveyor may  jam \" .",
    "this is an important distinction between white dwarfs and neutron stars or black holes , as the latter two can remove the thermal energy by neutrino cooling or advection through the event horizon , respectively .",
    "in contrast to a wd , neutrino cooling is ineffective and thermal pressure builds , such that radiation pressure may again become dynamically significant @xcite .",
    "this in turn shuts down the accretion to at most , the eddington rate .",
    "( eq .  [ [ eq::toroidal ] ] ) , at the wd surface as a function of the mass of the tidally disrupted companion @xmath44 .",
    "toroidal field strengths are presented for two values of the viscosity , @xmath79 ( _ solid line _ ) and @xmath80 ( _ dotted line _ ) and assuming an accretion efficiency @xmath81 .",
    "the white dwarf mass and radius are @xmath82 and @xmath83  cm , respectively .",
    "the vertical lines show the companion mass above which photons are trapped in the accretion flow ( i.e. , @xmath84 ; eq .  [ [ eq : trap_ratio ] ] ) , such that super - eddington accretion occurs .",
    "[ fig : fig1],width=336 ]    however , this scenario neglects the possibility of outflows , which can sustain inflow by carrying away the majority of the thermal energy , thereby allowing a smaller fraction of the material to accrete at a higher than eddington rate . though more work is needed to assess the efficiency of outflows in the present context , radiatively - inefficient accretion flows are widely thought to be prone to powerful outflows @xcite .",
    "even if accretion occurs at , or near , the eddington rate , the fields produced ( @xmath85  mg ) are still strong enough to explain the bulk of the magnetized wd population .",
    "the origin of the strongest field systems ( @xmath0100 - 1000 mg ) may be problematic if accretion is limited to the eddington rate .",
    "nevertheless , the material deposited outside the wd will be hot and virialized , forming an extended envelope with a lengthscale comparable to the radius .",
    "though initially hot , this material will eventually cool ( on longer , stellar timescales ) and become incorporated into the stellar layers near the proto - wd surface .",
    "if this material cools at some fraction of the local eddington luminosity , it will be incorporated onto the wd surface on a timescale @xmath0@xmath86 years , which is much less than typical agb lifetimes .",
    "a final complication may arise because the composition of the companion is likely to be hydrogen - rich and will begin to burn thermonuclearly as material accretes or after it settles on the proto - wd surface . because the energy released in burning hydrogen to helium ( @xmath87 mev nucleon@xmath36 ) vastly exceeds the gravitational binding energy per nucleon at the wd surface ( @xmath88 mev nucleon@xmath36 ) , burning that occurs explosively could have a dynamical impact . for the accretion rates of relevance",
    ", we estimate that the midplane temperature of the disk exceeds @xmath89 k , such that hydrogen will burn via the hot cno cycle .",
    "the hot cno cycle occurs at a rate that is independent of temperature and is itself thermally stable . however , hydrogen - rich material deposited in the he burning layer may , under some circumstances , trigger a thermonuclear runaway @xcite , which could remove the accreted mass from the proto - wd surface , or even eject the common envelope entirely . in what follows",
    "we assume stable burning and set aside this important caveat . additional work will , however , be required to address what conditions are required for stable versus explosive burning .    due to the presence of shear in the disk ,",
    "the mri is a likely source of turbulence , which in turn amplifies magnetic field .",
    "large - scale fields produced by the mri have been modeled via @xmath5 dynamos at various levels of sophistication ( see @xcite for the most recent example ) . however , for the purposes of estimating orders of magnitude of the fields , approximate values from less sophisticated treatments can be employed .",
    "although this situation is qualitatively similar to that described in the previous subsection , the dynamo we envision here operates in the accretion disk and not the envelope .",
    "the alfvn velocity in the disk obeys @xmath90 @xcite , such that the mean toroidal field at radius @xmath53 is given by @xcite @xmath91 where in the second equality we have substituted equation ( [ eq : mdot0 ] ) for @xmath64 , and multiplied by the factor @xmath92 to account for the possibility of outflows as described above . if an @xmath5 dynamo operates , the mean poloidal field @xmath93 is related to the toroidal field via @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "however , regardless of whether a large scale field is generated , a turbulent field of magnitude @xmath95 is likely to be present and contributing significantly to the maxwell stresses responsible for disk accretion .    figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the toroidal field evaluated near the wd surface @xmath96  cm as a function of companion mass @xmath44 , calculated for two different values of the viscosity ( @xmath79 and @xmath97 ) . in both cases ,",
    "we assume that @xmath81 .",
    "note that for the range of relevant companion masses @xmath98 @xmath99 , @xmath100  mg , in precisely the correct range to explain the inferred surface field strengths of hfmwds .",
    "although our results suggest that companion accretion can produce the field strengths necessary to explain hfmwds , for the field to be present on the surface of the wd when it forms , it must at a minimum survive the remaining lifetime of the star .",
    "in particular , the field will decay due to ohmic diffusion on the timescale @xmath101 where @xmath102 @xmath35s@xmath36 is the spitzer resistivity , ln@xmath103 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath104 is the stellar temperature near the proto - wd surface , and @xmath105 is the final thickness of the accreted companion mass after it is incorporated into the surface layers of proto - wd , where @xmath106 is the mean density of the proto - wd .    equation ( [ eq : taudecay ] ) shows that for typical core temperatures during the agb phase @xmath107 k , @xmath108 exceeds the mean agb lifetime @xmath109 myr for @xmath110 .",
    "this suggests that fields may survive ohmic decay , at least for very massive companions .",
    "furthermore , the magnetized companion material may become incorporated into the degenerate wd core long before the agb phase ends , in which case the much higher conductivity due to degenerate electrons substantially increase the ohmic decay timescale over that given by equation ( [ eq : taudecay ] ) , thereby ensuring long - term field survival .",
    "recent observational evidence from the sloan digital sky survey strongly suggests that high - field magnetic white dwarfs originate from binary interactions .",
    "in particular , it was proposed that the progenitors of hfmwds are binary systems that evolve through a common envelope phase @xcite . in this scenario , companions that survive ce evolution ( leaving tight binaries ) may produce magnetic cataclysmic variables , while those that do not survive ( i.e. that merge ) may produce isolated hfmwds .    to investigate this hypothesis ,",
    "we have estimated the magnetic fields resulting from a low - mass companion embedded in a ce phase with a post - ms giant . during in - spiral , the companion transfers energy and angular momentum to the envelope .",
    "the resulting shearing profile , coupled with the presence of convection , can amplify large - scale magnetic fields via dynamo action in the envelope .",
    "we incorporate the back - reaction of the magnetic field growth on the shear , which results in a transient dynamo .",
    "the fields generated at the interface between the convective and radiative zones are weak ( @xmath02@xmath111  g ) and would have to diffuse to the wd surface and anchor there if they are to explain the hfmwds .",
    "a successful envelope dynamo scenario must also survive to the end of the agb phase , which probably means only if the companion ejects the turbulent envelope ; the dynamo is transient as long as there is a source of turbulent diffusion .",
    "the bulk of the systems formed this way might be post - ce , tight binaries  potentially magnetic cvs .",
    "to explain isolated hfmwds , an alternative to a dynamo operating in the envelope is a dynamo operating in an accretion disk . during the ce phase ,",
    "if the companion is of sufficiently low mass , it avoids prematurely ejecting the envelope .",
    "instead , in - spiral proceeds until the companion is tidally shredded by the gravitational field of the proto - wd .",
    "the subsequent formation of an accretion disk , which also posesses turbulence and shear , can amplify magnetic fields via dynamo action . for the range of disrupted companions considered here , the disk initially accretes at super - eddington values . in this hyper - critical regime ,",
    "the timescale for photon diffusion out of the disk is longer than the viscous timescale . for a range of disrupted - companion disks , we find that the saturated toroidal mean - field attains values between a few and a few thousand megagauss .",
    "amplification of the magnetic field in a super - eddington accretion disk is attractive as it reproduces the observed range of hfmwds and naturally transports magnetic flux to the wd surface .",
    "high - mass stars may also undergo common envelope interactions in the presence of close companions .",
    "if the common envelope field mechanisms described here operate in high - mass stars , then the result could be strong field neutron stars or magnetars ( neutron stars with magnetic fields in excess of @xmath0@xmath112  g ) .",
    "in particular , formation of an accretion disk from an engulfed companion during a red supergiant phase could produce a magnetized wd core . in the eventual core - collapse and stellar supernova explosion ( possibly driven by the neutrino mechanism ;",
    "@xcite ) , the magnetized wd core collapses to a neutron star . if simple flux freezing operates ( itself an open question ) and the initial magnetized core is on the order of @xmath0100 - 1000  mg , homologous collapse to a neutron star would generate @xmath0@xmath112  g fields .",
    "typical neutron stars that possess modest field strengths may originate from core - collapse supernova of single stars or stars without having incurred a ce phase .",
    "note that what we are proposing here is an alternative to the neutrino - driven convection dynamo described in @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the engulfment of a companion and the formation of an accretion disk naturally provides fast rotation , magnetized turbulence and differential rotation .",
    "we emphasize that the viability of this mechanism depends on the length scale of the magnetic field deposited in the pre - collapse core , which must be sufficiently large to produce , upon collapse , the dipole - scale , volume - encompassing fields necessary to account for the spin - down behavior of magnetars and the energy budget of their giant flares @xcite .    in summary , common envelope evolution as the origin of strongly - magnetized",
    ", compact objects seems plausible . whether this hypothesis is ultimately found to be viable",
    "will depend on the statistics of low - mass stellar and substellar companions to stars of similar masses to ( or somewhat higher masses than ) the sun .",
    "the numerous radial velocity searches of the last 20 years have revealed a number of such companions @xcite .",
    "the precise occurrence rate of companions in orbits that could lead to the kind of disk - dynamo mechanism described above remains unclear ( though if such companions turn out to be rarer than the hfmwd fraction , then the sdss data indicating a binary origin would be puzzling ) . further theoretical work into the binary origin of hfmwds and magnetars requires the development of multi - dimensional , magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ce phase .",
    "such an approach has already had initial success for purely hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations @xcite .",
