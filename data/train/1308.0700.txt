    "in principle , the fundamental theory of strong interaction , the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , provides the whole information of the hadrons from the underlying degrees of freedom , the quark and gluon .",
    "the complexity of qcd vacuum , however , makes the direct calculation via qcd , e.g. , the simulation via qcd on lattice , quite nontrivial for the light sector of quark@xcite(below @xmath4 ) .    on the other hand , the effective models of hadrons , such as the skyrme model@xcite , the mit bag models @xcite",
    ", the cloudy bag model@xcite , the quark models in the nonrelativistic form(nqm)isgurkarl and the relativistic form @xcite , etc . , also enable us to explore the strong interaction at low - energy . while the nqm is successful , the mit bag model provides a conceptually simple picture of hadrons .",
    "though it incorporates both confinement and asymptotic freedom of qcd , the mit bag model , in its original form@xcite , did not possess chiral symmetry , another main feature of qcd at low energy . in the hybrid chiral bag(hcb ) model , chodos and thorn@xcite and brown and rho @xcite restored chiral symmetry by introducing pions into the bag lagrangian .",
    "thus a baryon can be thought to be three - quarks inside a bag , surrounded by a cloud of pions , which makes the nucleon - nucleon  interaction description@xcite via the exchange of pions accessible .    in the nonlinear - pion treatment",
    "the hcb model@xcite ( seehosaka96 for a review ) the confined quarks inside bag interact with the pion through the chirally - invariant coupling at the bag surface by interpolating the skyrme model in the limit of the small - bag(the bag radius @xmath5 ) and the mit bag model in the large - bag limits(@xmath6 ) . to do so",
    ", a bag function @xmath7(unit in the bag volume @xmath8 and zero outside ) and its delta function @xmath9(@xmath10 on the surface @xmath11 of @xmath8 and zero elsewhere ) were used to imitate the permanent confinement of quarks in hadrons and ensure the continuity of the axial - vector current .",
    "the hcb lagrangian reads@xcite @xmath12where @xmath13 is the lagrangian of pion @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 . in the case that @xmath13 is the skyrme lagrangian@xcite the model ( [ hcb ] ) describes a quark bag as a defect in the skyrme field , and realizes the chiral symmetry in the wigner mode inside the bag and in the nambu - goldstone mode outside , with the baryon charge ( @xmath0 ) conserved topologically . due to the sharp surface of the bag which allows the creation of virtual pions with arbitrarily high momenta ,",
    "however , the self - energy of nucleon remains to be infinite and the origin of the bag to be unknown in the bag models including the hcb model ( [ hcb ] ) .",
    "one way to avoid self - energy divergence of nucleon is to include the exterior fermions@xcite with the finite self - energy of nucleon arising from casimir effect .",
    "another approach@xcite is to replace the unphysical bag boundary by a finite surface thickness of the quark core within the framework of the relativistic quark model with static potential .",
    "also , an attempt @xcite was made to regularize the self - energy by introducing a soft(fuzzy ) bag surface .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a type of soft bag function formed by nonlinear pion to make the bag surface of baryon dynamical .",
    "it is illustrated that the softening of chiral bag gives rise to a chiral quark model with an effectively generated mass of quark , in which confined valence quark interacts with a chiral cloudy of the pion .",
    "the finite mass of nucleon including pion dressing is obtained through renormalization of the quark field in terms of pion , and a prediction @xmath0 @xmath17 for the bag constant is made@xmath18 . using two free parameters of the model , the self coupling @xmath2 of self - pion and the confining scale @xmath3 , some properties(the mass , the charge root - mean - square radius and magnetic moment ) of the proton",

    "are estimated to be about @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "this is done by using a trial profile for the hedgehog skyrmion@xcite in the process of solving model .",
    "to incorporate the surface dynamics into the hcb model in which the bag functions(@xmath21 ) are singular , we propose the following continuous bag functions constructed in terms of the nonlinear chiral field @xmath22 of pion , to replace the singular bag functions in the hcb model , @xmath23 , \\\\",
