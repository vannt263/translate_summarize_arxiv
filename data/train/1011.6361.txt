    "analyses of correlations between particles emitted in heavy - ion collisions reveal azimuthal structure that is not seen in proton - proton or deuteron - gold collisions .",
    "these unique correlations are present even if the particles are separated by a large interval in rapidity .",
    "the largest component , known as elliptic flow , is one of the early observations at rhic  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was noticed that more detailed features of the correlation pattern known as `` ridge '' and `` shoulder '' can also be explained by a new phenomenon , dubbed `` triangular flow '' , which comes from a hydrodynamic response to fluctuations in the initial geometry  @xcite .",
    "an analysis  @xcite of recent experimental data  @xcite shows that _ all _ the correlations observed at large relative pseudorapidities are likely to originate from collective flow ( and global momentum conservation ) .",
    "contributions from event - by - event fluctuations , which in the past have been neglected , are key to this understanding .    teaney and yan  @xcite have shown that such fluctuations in the initial geometry are expected to create a new type of directed flow in addition to elliptic and triangular flow .",
    "fluctuations break the symmetry of the initial density profile , and as a result there is , in general , one direction where the profile is steepest .",
    "this effect can be quantified as a dipole asymmetry in the initial density  @xcite : @xmath0 where the averages in the right - hand side are taken over the initial transverse entropy density profile , and @xmath1 is a polar coordinate system around the center of the distribution , chosen such that @xmath2 .",
    "if one chooses @xmath3 to be positive , then @xmath4 generally corresponds to the steepest direction for a smooth profile , and @xmath3 is the magnitude of the dipole asymmetry . in general",
    ", @xmath3 will differ from 0  even at midrapidity  due to fluctuations .",
    "this dipole asymmetry , followed by hydrodynamic expansion , creates a specific type of flow .",
    "recall that particles with large transverse momentum @xmath5 are created where the fluid velocity is largest , and their momentum is parallel to the fluid velocity  @xcite .",
    "the fluid velocity scales like the gradients of the initial density profile , and so high-@xmath5 particles are likely to be emitted along the steepest gradient , i.e. , with azimuth @xmath4 . just as the quadrupole asymmetry in the distribution of outgoing particles is quantified by the well - studied elliptic flow coefficient @xmath6 , the second fourier harmonic with respect to the event plane , this asymmetry can be characterized by the directed flow measured with respect to @xmath4 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the azimuthal angle of the outgoing particle momentum and the brackets indicate an average over these particles in a given collision event .    while @xmath9 is positive for high-@xmath5 particles , the condition that the total net transverse momentum of the fluid approximately vanishes implies in turn that @xmath9 is negative for low-@xmath5 particles , which results in a specific pattern for the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "although @xmath4 can not be measured experimentally , the correlation of every particle to @xmath4 induces a correlation between pairs of particles , which can be measured even if @xmath4 is not known .    unlike the usual directed flow , which is odd in rapidity  @xcite ,",
    "this new type of directed flow is expected to depend little on rapidity , since it is created by fluctuations in the initial geometry .",
    "hints of this phenomenon can already be seen in existing data , and it enables a complete quantitative understanding of long - range dihadron correlations ( in conjunction with the previously studied elliptic flow , quadrangular flow @xcite , triangular flow , and momentum conservation ) @xcite . in this article , we extract differential directed flow from recent experimental data  @xcite , and we propose a method to measure it directly .",
    "the star collaboration has released an analysis of dihadron correlations at different angles with respect to the event plane  @xcite . they have measured the distribution of the relative azimuthal angle @xmath10 between a high-@xmath5 trigger particle and an associated particle in various @xmath5 bins .    along with the contribution from flow",
    ", this measurement also contains a correlation induced by the global conservation of transverse momentum .",
    "the overall probability of detecting a pair of particles with transverse momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be written in terms of the one - particle distribution @xmath13 , under fairly general assumptions , as  @xcite : @xmath14 where the sum is over all particles in the event and the brackets average over all events in the centrality bin under consideration , and @xmath15 .",
    "the term in parentheses represents the preference for back - to - back emission due to the near - vanishing total transverse momentum .",
    "the one - particle distribution is typically characterized in terms of fourier components @xmath16 plugging this into eq .  ,",
    "the first fourier harmonic of this two - particle correlation , @xmath17 , can then be written , to first order , as a sum of contributions from momentum conservation and from directed flow  @xcite @xmath18 here , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the directed flows of the associated and trigger particles , and higher order terms are negligible when each of these is much smaller than 1 .",
    "explicitly , then , the momentum conservation correlation is @xmath21 we assume that these are the only contributions at large relative pseudorapidity @xmath22 . in practice , we use star data projected onto @xmath23 .    in order to isolate the flow contribution , one must quantitatively estimate the effect of momentum conservation .",
    "we estimate the denominator of eq .   in the following way",
    ": we use the total pion and kaon multiplicities measured by brahms in central collisions  @xcite , and we rescale them to the 20%-60% centrality range assuming that the correlation ( [ momcons ] ) scales with centrality approximately like @xmath24 , which increases the correlation by a factor @xmath25 .",
    "we calculate @xmath26 for pions , kaons and nucleons assuming exponential @xmath27 spectra , and using the inverse slopes of @xmath27 spectra measured by phenix at mid - rapidity in the centrality range 40%-50%  @xcite .",
    "we further estimate that the effective inverse slopes , averaged over all rapidities , are 10% smaller than the inverse slopes at mid - rapidity , based on the observed decrease of @xmath28 versus rapidity  @xcite .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath29    subtracting the contribution of momentum conservation from the measured @xmath30 , we extract @xmath31 using eq .",
    "( [ decomposition ] ) . since @xmath9 is defined as a correlation with a direction @xmath4 which is itself uncorrelated with the reaction plane  @xcite , one expects that this quantity is independent of the orientation of the trigger particle",
    "this is indeed what is observed by analyzing star results  @xcite . in order to increase the statistics , we average the measured @xmath17 over all orientations . we thus obtain 10 values of @xmath17 , corresponding to 5 intervals in @xmath5 below 3  gev / c for the associated particle , and 2 intervals in @xmath5 for the trigger particle , namely , @xmath32",
    "= 34 , 46 gev .     of charged hadrons extracted from star correlation data @xcite .",
    "circles ( squares ) correspond to trigger particles with @xmath33 = 34 ( 46 ) gev .",
    "closed ( open ) symbols correspond to assumed values of @xmath34 ( 0.13 ) .",
    "error bars are statistical only .",
    "the value of @xmath5 on the horizontal axis is the average value in the corresponding bin . for @xmath35",
    "gev / c , this value is obtained using @xmath5 spectra measured by phenix  @xcite in the centrality bin 30 - 40% . for the lowest bin ,",
    "it is obtained by assuming an exponential @xmath27 spectrum . for sake of clarity , @xmath28 has been shifted by @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) for open ( closed ) symbols . ]    assuming some value of @xmath19 , we can extract @xmath38 from the product @xmath39 .",
    "there is some arbitrariness in this procedure , but @xmath9 is expected to be a smooth function of @xmath5 , so that it should have comparable values in the intervals 23 and 34 gev .",
    "any value of @xmath19 in the range 0.100.13 gives reasonable results for both sets of trigger particles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] .",
    "in particular , we obtain similar curves for @xmath38 from both sets of trigger particles , which supports the validity of eq .",
    "( [ decomposition ] ) .",
    "teaney and yan @xcite used ideal hydrodynamics to make predictions for this @xmath9 , and , although the values given were not intended as precise , realistic predictions , the generic properties seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] match these expectations .",
    "the variation of @xmath9 with @xmath5 is as predicted below 2  gev ( see fig .",
    "12 of ref .",
    "in particular , the absence of net transverse momentum implies that the sum of @xmath40 over all particles vanishes , which explains why @xmath9 changes sign near 0.8  gev / c .",
    "above 2  gev , @xmath9 deviates from the linear rise predicted by ideal hydrodynamics and saturates or decreases , as expected , in the same way as elliptic flow  @xcite , due to viscous corrections and/or the onset of hard physics not captured by hydrodynamics .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath9 is also roughly as expected : the initial dipole asymmetry @xmath3 defined by eq .",
    "( [ defpsi1 ] ) is predicted to be approximately 4 times smaller than the initial eccentricity @xmath41 for au - au collisions  @xcite . in the momentum range",
    "@xmath42  gev , hydrodynamics predicts @xmath43 . since @xmath44 in this momentum range for the same centrality window  @xcite ,",
    "one expects @xmath45 , in good agreement with the value in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] .    the estimates in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1 ] have sizable errors . first , there are unnecessary statistical errors ( shown in the figure ) , because they are extracted from correlations involving a trigger particle with high transverse momentum , and there are few such particles .",
    "uncertainty in @xmath46 for each bin is also present .",
    "most important , however , is the large systematic error coming from the estimation of the momentum conservation correlation .",
    "we estimate that our value for the denominator in eq .",
    "is only accurate to @xmath47 .",
    "this can change the extracted value of @xmath9 by as much as 50% .",
    "fortunately , these errors can be significantly reduced by carrying out a dedicated analysis .",
    "directed flow is most often analyzed using an event - plane method , analogous to the one often used for elliptic flow  @xcite . in every event ,",
    "one defines the directed flow `` event plane , does not actually denote a plane , but is a specific direction for directed flow .",
    "the terminology is meant to emphasize the similarity to a @xmath6 event plane analysis ] '' @xmath48 by @xmath49 where the sum is over particles detected in the event , @xmath50 are the azimuthal angles of outgoing particles , and @xmath51 is a weight , and @xmath52 . our new method is based on a new choice for the weight @xmath51 .",
    "the weight of a particle is generally a function of its transverse momentum @xmath5 and rapidity @xmath53 .",
    "the desired conditions are that    * correlations from momentum conservation should not bias the flow analysis .",
    "since these correlations are proportional to @xmath5 , this gives the condition @xmath54 , where angular brackets denote an average over the detector acceptance .",
    "* particles with larger @xmath9 should be given more weight , the optimal choice being @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "for smooth initial conditions , the symmetry between target and projectile implies that @xmath9 is an odd function of @xmath53 .",
    "a standard choice is @xmath56 , which satisfies both requirements if the detector acceptance is symmetric with respect to midrapidity . by construction , this results in a measured @xmath9 that , on average , vanishes at midrapidity and is antisymmetric in @xmath53 .    in this paper , we study directed flow created by fluctuations in the initial geometry .",
    "these fluctuations are expected to depend weakly on rapidity  @xcite .",
    "thus we choose a weight that depends on @xmath5 only . the choice @xmath57 where angular brackets denote an average over particles in the detector acceptance , satisfies the condition @xmath58 , so that momentum conservation does not bias the analysis .",
    "it also corresponds to the expected behavior of @xmath59 in ideal hydrodynamics in the limit of low freeze - out temperature for massless particles  @xcite .    instead of the event - plane method",
    ", one can use any of its variants such as the scalar - product method  @xcite .",
    "all methods should give the same result provided that one only correlates particles , or subevents , separated by a gap in pseudorapidity in order to remove nonflow effects .",
    "we have shown that the first fourier harmonic , @xmath17 , of the two - particle correlation measured by star shows the first evidence for a sizable directed flow originating from fluctuations of the initial geometry .",
    "this is an interesting new phenomenon that , like triangular flow , results from initial state fluctuations and subsequent hydrodynamic evolution , and provides the last puzzle piece needed for a complete description of long - range dihadron correlations . unlike the usual directed flow , this phenomenon has no correlation with the reaction plane and should depend weakly on rapidity .",
    "it changes sign around @xmath60  gev , and may reach values as large as 10% at high @xmath5 for mid - central collisions .",
    "we have proposed a specific method to analyze this new observable , which eliminates correlations from momentum conservation .",
    "such dedicated measurements of this new @xmath9 at rhic and lhc will help constrain models of initial conditions and confirm the hydrodynamic behavior of the collision system .",
    "we thank fuqiang wang for providing the data , and jean - paul blaizot and frederique grassi for discussions .",
    "we also thank nicolas borghini for noticing the typo in eq .   in the published manuscript , which has been corrected here .",
