    "the most essential primitive for private communication between two parties , alice and bob , in classical computation is the one - time pad .",
    "in such a scheme , the two parties share a secret key that is unknown to an external observer eve ; this key enables reliable communication by the parties as the message appears to be a random mixture of input bits from eve s viewpoint without the key .",
    "private quantum codes were initially introduced as the quantum analogue of the classical one - time pad .",
    "the basic setting for a `` private quantum channel '' @xcite is as follows : alice and bob share a private classical key that alice uses to inform bob which of a set of unitary operators @xmath0 she has used to encode her quantum state : @xmath1 . with this information in hand , bob can decode and recover the state @xmath2 without disturbing it .",
    "the set of unitaries @xmath3 and the probability distribution @xmath4 that makes up the random key which determines the encoding unitary are shared publicly .",
    "thus , without further information , eve s description of the system is given by the random unitary channel @xmath5 . by selecting certain sets of unitary operators with appropriate coefficients ,",
    "the random unitary channel will provide eve with no information about the input state .",
    "the body of work on private quantum codes now includes a variety of other applications , with realizations both as subspaces and subsystems of hilbert space .",
    "private shared reference frames exploit private subspaces and subsystems that also arise from the ignorance associated with an eavesdropper s description of a system @xcite .",
    "the notion of using mixed state ancilla qubits to encode information , which can be viewed as subsystem encodings , has also been studied in the context of quantum secret sharing  @xcite .",
    "there , the goal is to encode information into a globally mixed state of @xmath6  qubits such that to recover the quantum information one would need access to @xmath7 qubits of the global state , where any fewer would yield no information regarding the initial state .",
    "using mixed states allows for the increase of @xmath7 for a fixed @xmath6 , thus solidifying the idea that mixed state encodings increase privacy .",
    "there are also bridges between these works and quantum error correction , formalized by the complementarity results of @xcite .",
    "connections between the study of private quantum codes and the theory of operator algebras have recently been found as well @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we consider the most general notion of a private quantum code @xcite , which involves the encoding of quantum bits into subsystems .",
    "private quantum channels , private subspaces , and what we refer to as `` operator '' private subsystems  are captured as special cases of this general phenomena .",
    "we consider a class of phase damping channels throughout the presentation that highlights the main differences between mappings on subsystems and subspaces .",
    "most surprisingly , we show that certain classes of channels can only be private in the subtle subsystem sense ; thus establishing that private subsystems can exist in the absence of private subspaces .",
    "we also make the first significant move toward a structure theory for private quantum codes ; specifically we set out algebraic conditions that characterize privacy of a code in terms of the kraus operators for a given quantum channel .",
    "this can be viewed as an analogue of the set of knill - laflamme conditions @xcite from quantum error correction to this setting , and indeed we discuss further connections with error correction . in particular we show that complementarity of private and error - correcting codes fails at the most general level , and we point out a potentially new type of quantum error - correcting code .",
    "we now describe our notation and nomenclature . given a quantum system @xmath8 , with ( finite - dimensional and complex ) hilbert space also denoted by @xmath8 , we will use customary notation such as @xmath2 , @xmath9 for density operators .",
    "the set of linear operators on @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "linear maps on @xmath10 can be viewed as operators acting on the operator space @xmath10 .",
    "we use the term _ ( quantum ) channel _ to refer to a completely positive and trace - preserving linear map @xmath11 .",
    "such maps describe ( discrete ) time evolution of open quantum systems in the schrdinger picture , and can always be written in the choi - kraus operator - sum form @xmath12 for some operators @xmath13 in @xmath10 satisfying @xmath14 .",
    "the composition of two maps will be denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "a ( linearly closed ) subspace @xmath16 of @xmath8 is said to be a _ private subspace _ for @xmath17 if there is a density operator @xmath18 on @xmath8 such that @xmath19 for all pure states @xmath20 in @xmath16 . by linearity ,",
    "@xmath21 for all @xmath2 in @xmath22 .",
    "we could also consider a collection of private states not associated with a subspace of the hilbert space , but , as in quantum error correction , we wish to allow for arbitrary superpositions of our code states and this demands the set of states considered are linearly closed .",
    "a quantum system @xmath23 is a _",
    "subsystem _ of @xmath8 if we can write @xmath24 .",
    "this definition is symmetric in that @xmath25 is also considered a subsystem of @xmath8 .",
    "the sub__spaces _ _ of @xmath8 can be viewed as subsystems @xmath23 for which @xmath25 is one - dimensional .",
    "a subscript such as @xmath26 means the operator belongs to @xmath27 .",
    "a subsystem @xmath23 is a _ private subsystem _ for @xmath17 if there is a @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that @xmath30 the case of random unitary channels @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ private_definition ] ) was first considered in @xcite where the terminology _ private quantum channels _ was used , and the case of general channels @xmath17 was formalized in @xcite where private subsystems were given the extra prefix `` completely '' that we have dropped . if eq .",
    "( [ private_definition ] ) holds for all @xmath31 , as opposed to a single state @xmath31 , then we shall refer to @xmath23 as an _ operator private subsystem _ ( since these are precisely the private subsystems that are complementary to operator quantum error - correcting subsystems discussed below ) .",
    "an operator private subsystem is one in which the private channel splits into a product of maps on the individual subsystems @xmath25 and @xmath23 when the channel is restricted to the combined product subspace @xmath32 .",
    "such private subsystems can not exist without the existence of private subspaces ; indeed , if eq .",
    "( [ private_definition ] ) holds for all states on @xmath25 , it follows that every sub__space _ _ @xmath33 is private for @xmath17 for any fixed pure state @xmath20 on @xmath25 .",
    "even though the definition given by eq .",
    "( [ private_definition ] ) allows for the possibility of examples of private subsystems that do not extend to private subspaces , the private subsystems exhibited in the literature @xcite thus far have either been of operator type , or are already subspaces . here",
    "we present the first examples of private subsystems for which there are no private subspaces that exist ; in particular these are private subsystems that are not of operator type .",
    "our motivating class of channels is built upon a simple phase damping model .",
    "we begin the discussion by recalling the most basic private quantum channel and asking some basic questions on quantum privacy .",
    "the completely depolarizing channel ( @xmath34 for all @xmath2 ) is an easy to describe example of a quantum channel that is private . in this case",
    "the entire hilbert space acts as a private code for the channel , and so in order to implement such a private channel a full set of pauli rotations must be available .",
    "this leads to a very basic question in the study of private quantum codes : do there exist channels with fewer physical operations such that we can still encode qubits for privacy ?",
    "perhaps the simplest class of channels one could imagine would be the family of phase damping channels that can be applied to any qubit of a larger hilbert space  @xmath35 of @xmath6  qubits , @xmath36 a single qubit phase damping channel is not private .",
    "yet we can ask : can composing the phase damping channel on multiple qubits yield a private subspace  @xmath37 ?",
    "such a question is analogous to the sort of questions that have been asked in quantum error correction for some time ; for example , given a set of errors that are uncorrectable on a single qubit , does there exist a larger hilbert space such that the action of the error on the encoded hilbert space is correctable ?",
    "the answer to such a question in quantum error correction is yes , as demonstrated by the five - qubit code which corrects for arbitrary single - qubit errors , an error that would be uncorrectable if one did not have access to a larger hilbert space to encode the quantum information into a quantum code .",
    "we shall define the map @xmath38 as the composition of the maps @xmath39 on each of the @xmath6  qubits of the state @xmath40 , @xmath41 equivalently one could consider the @xmath6-product map @xmath42 of the single qubit channel @xmath43 . for any input state @xmath2 , this channel will decohere all off - diagonal terms in the computational basis ; as such , the resulting output density matrix will be diagonal .",
    "consider the case when @xmath44 .",
    "every output state of @xmath38 has the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the one - qubit identity and pauli @xmath47 matrices .",
    "the goal is to find a subspace @xmath16 of dimension  2 and a state @xmath48 such that @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "this would show that @xmath38 has a private qubit subspace , defined by a pair of orthogonal logical states @xmath51 , @xmath52 in @xmath16 .",
    "however , one can show that such a subspace _ does not _ exist .",
    "in fact we can prove the following more general result , which applies to the channels @xmath38 directly , and can be extended to channels with commuting normal kraus operators as well .",
    "we leave the proof for @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be a random unitary channel with mutually commuting kraus operators .",
    "then @xmath17 has no private subspaces .",
    "[ lem : randomunitarychannel ]    is this the end of the story ?",
    "this result is intuitive  at first glance it certainly does not `` feel '' as though we should be able to find private codes for channels such as the phase damping maps @xmath53 due to the preservation of information stored in the diagonal elements of the initial density matrix .",
    "moreover , the experience with operator private subsystems , which demand the existence of private subspaces , also suggests we can go no further with these channels .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we do find private subsystems for these channels , and necessarily they are not of the type exhibited before .",
    "indeed , consider the following logically encoded qubits in two - qubit hilbert space : @xmath54 this describes a single qubit encoding , as eq .",
    "( [ subsystem_encoding ] ) describes the coordinates for a logical bloch sphere in two - qubit hilbert space with logical pauli operators given by @xmath55 .",
    "now , observe that the dephasing map @xmath56",
    "acting on each density operator @xmath57 produces an output state that is maximally mixed ; that is , @xmath58 for all @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we see that eq .",
    "( [ subsystem_encoding ] ) yields a private two - qubit code for the dephasing map @xmath38 .",
    "however , we know from lemma  [ lem : randomunitarychannel ] that the input space can not be a subspace , and we have already noted this implies it also can not be an operator subsystem .",
    "it is however still a private subsystem in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ private_definition ] ) .",
    "let us discuss the encoding in more detail .",
    "algebra into encoded states of the form of eq .  .",
    "the encoded two - qubit state subjected to the two - qubit phase damping channel @xmath59 results in an output of the completely mixed state on two qubits , @xmath60.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the logical encoding of a single qubit into a two - qubit subsystem is shown by the unitary operation given by the red boxed region in figure  [ fig : privatechannel ] .",
    "the mapping , given by a pair of cnot gates and the @xmath61 , shows a unitary equivalency between the two - qubit operator algebra  @xmath62 and the encoded logical qubit through the following transformation of the basis elements of @xmath63 , @xmath64 more generally , a logical qubit encoding into a subsystem of a @xmath6-qubit hilbert space can be constructed to privatize the @xmath6-qubit phase damping channel @xmath65 , which by lemma  [ lem : randomunitarychannel ] can not have a private subspace .    for any @xmath6-qubit hilbert space @xmath66",
    ", there exist quantum channels @xmath17 for which a private quantum subsystem @xmath23 of @xmath66 can be constructed in the absence of the existence of any private quantum subspace @xmath67 .",
    "[ thm : randomunitarychannel ]",
    "if we are given a quantum channel @xmath12 and a subsystem @xmath23 , we can ask if it is possible to decide whether @xmath23 is private for @xmath17 ; and more to the point , we can ask if this can be answered in terms of the kraus operators @xmath13 for the channel . the analogous question in quantum error correction",
    "is answered by the fundamental knill - laflamme conditions @xcite , which provide an explicit set of algebraic constraints in terms of the kraus operators and the code , and allow one to test whether a given code is correctable for a channel .",
    "the generalization of these conditions to the case of operator error - correcting subsystems was established in @xcite .",
    "the following result answers this question for private quantum subsystems .",
    "in addition to kraus operators , we would expect the algebra to include the fixed @xmath25 state @xmath31 and output state @xmath18observe that this information is indeed included in the conditions .",
    "a subsystem @xmath23 is private for a channel @xmath12 with fixed @xmath25 state @xmath31 and output state @xmath18 if and only if there are complex scalars @xmath68 forming an isometry matrix @xmath69 such that @xmath70 , where @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) are eigenstates ( eigenvalues ) of @xmath31 and @xmath18 respectively , @xmath75 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath23 , and where @xmath71 is viewed as a channel from @xmath23 into @xmath8 .",
    "the key observation in establishing this result is that the left and right hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ private_definition ] ) each define channels from @xmath23 to @xmath8 which are in fact the same .",
    "one can then use basic results from the theory of completely positive maps to obtain the equations spelled out in the theorem .",
    "more details on the theory will be presented in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that this result is new even for private sub__spaces__. in the notation of the theorem for that case , @xmath25 is one - dimensional and @xmath23 is the subspace .",
    "if we let @xmath76 be the projector of @xmath8 onto @xmath23 , then we see that the characterization of privacy is given by the conditions : @xmath77 for all @xmath78 . as a simple illustration , in the case of the completely depolarizing channel on @xmath79-dimensional hilbert space",
    ", @xmath76 is the identity operator and these conditions reduce to the kraus operators satisfying @xmath80 , for some choice of orthonormal bases @xmath81 and @xmath82 and unitary matrix @xmath83 .",
    "one can also phrase the private subspace conditions neatly via the heisenberg picture in terms of the dual map @xmath84 , which has kraus operators @xmath85 , as follows  @xcite : @xmath86 for all ( arbitrary ) observables @xmath87 .",
    "of course the theorem applies to general private subsystems as well .",
    "here we point out how the 2-qubit phase damping channel @xmath38 can be assembled from this result . in that case",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath23 are spanned by @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath90 are @xmath91 , each having eigenvalue @xmath92 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath93 are @xmath94 , with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath95 . for brevity ,",
    "we omit the matrix calculations for the operators @xmath96 here ; we simply note that they are @xmath97 matrices formed with @xmath98 pauli operators and zero blocks .",
    "the scalar - valued matrix @xmath99 is indeed an isometry .",
    "furthermore , because the number of operators @xmath96 agrees with the number of operators @xmath100 ( namely , 8) , the matrix @xmath101 is in fact unitary .",
    "several links have been made between quantum error correction and quantum privacy . in the case of operator private subsystems and operator error - correcting subsystems ,",
    "the complementarity theorem of @xcite discussed below established an algebraic bridge between the two subjects .",
    "this firmly links the operator quantum error correction theory to that of operator private subsystems  results in one field can immediately be exported to the other .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask whether such a result holds in this more general setting . to answer this",
    "we need the concept of complementary channels .    as a consequence of the stinespring dilation theorem ,",
    "every channel @xmath17 may be seen to arise from an environment hilbert space @xmath102 , a pure state @xmath103 on the environment , and a unitary operator @xmath104 on the composite @xmath105 in the following sense : @xmath106 tracing out the system instead yields a complementary channel : @xmath107 the uniqueness built into the theorem yields a certain uniqueness for such a pair of channels , so that we talk of `` the '' complementary channel @xmath108 for a given channel @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we have already discussed operator private subsystems  the essential difference being that instead of a single state on @xmath25 , it is demanded that eq .",
    "( [ private_definition ] ) holds for all states on @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , an operator quantum error - correcting subsystem @xmath23 for a channel @xmath109 @xcite requires the existence of a correction operation @xmath110 such that : @xmath111 @xmath112 , @xmath113 for which @xmath114 . the main result of @xcite shows that @xmath23 is private for @xmath17 if and only if it is error - correcting for @xmath108 .",
    "does this result extend to the more general setting ?",
    "the kraus operators of the complementary map  @xmath115 are four orthogonal rank - one projectors in two - qubit hilbert space , and in particular the map determines a von neumann measurement .",
    "no error - correcting subsystem can be extracted in such a setting ; moreover , when the input space is restricted to be that of our example , the complementary map is private .",
    "thus , not only does the complementarity result fail , it fails dramatically .",
    "we save these calculations and further analysis for @xcite .",
    "this discussion motivates the following observation : the notion of an operator quantum error - correcting subsystem can be expanded to mimic the general definition of a private quantum subsystem . indeed , a revised definition analogous to that of eq .",
    "( [ private_definition ] ) could be proposed as follows : @xmath23 is _ correctable _ for @xmath109 if there exists an operation @xmath110 such that for all @xmath26 and some _ fixed _ states @xmath116 , we have @xmath117 this is a potentially new notion of quantum error - correcting code .",
    "we have studied the most general notion of private quantum subsystems . taking motivation from quantum error correction , specifically the knill - laflamme conditions",
    ", we presented algebraic conditions that characterize when a code is private for a given channel .",
    "this result is new even for private subspaces , and opens up questions such as : is there an analogue of the stabilizer formalism from quantum error correction for quantum privacy ?",
    "we analyzed the development of private subsystems for the special case given by the composition of phase damping channels on many qubit hilbert  spaces .",
    "while each individual channel of this form is not private , the composition of such channels were shown to contain a private single qubit subsystem . yet , for such channels , and for a wide class of more general channels , no private subspace or operator private subsystem exists .",
    "moreover , we discussed how the channel fails to have the corresponding complementary error - correctable pair as in the case of operator subsystems .",
    "nevertheless , this analysis naturally led us to define a potentially new form of quantum error - correcting code and warrants , along with the topic of channel complementarity , further investigation .",
    "finally , preliminary discussions also suggest there may be yet unexplored connections between the study of private quantum subsystems and privacy in classical communication",
