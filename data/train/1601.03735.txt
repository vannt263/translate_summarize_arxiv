    "the diversity and complexity of grb prompt emission light curves is often used to illustrate the difficulty in the classification of these sources and in the unification of their properties . a natural approach",
    "to get insight into such complexity is to look for global and average properties , like flux time integral ( i.e.__fluence _ _ ) , total duration , average spectrum , peak flux .",
    "alternatively , one can try to break down the light curve into simpler parts following some pattern .",

    "* ) performed careful analyses of light curves and time resolved spectra looking for patterns and for hints about such fundamental building blocks . as early as 1983 , @xcite found evidence of a correlation between spectral peak energy and photon flux during the decay of pulses .",
    "such correlation was later confirmed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and became known as the _ hardness - intensity correlation _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite was presumably the first to systematically decompose the light curves into pulses and to look for patterns in the properties of these putative building blocks .",
    "some years later , @xcite developed tools to calculate the emission from a relativistically expanding jet , including the case of an off - axis viewing angle .",
    "@xcite took advantage of this formulation to model the single pulse , finding that the spectral lag - luminosity and variability - luminosity correlations found by @xcite and @xcite can be explained as viewing angle effects .",
    "the pulse model at that stage assumed emission from a unique radius and from an infinitesimally short time interval ( i.e.a delta function in radius and time ) . in the following years",
    ", other authors proposed increasingly refined models of the pulse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but neglected the possibility for the jet to be observed off - axis .",
    "the viewing angle , i.e.the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight , is usually assumed to be smaller than the jet semi - aperture , in which case the jet is said to be _ on - axis_. for larger viewing angles , i.e.for _ off - axis _ jets , the flux is severely suppressed because of relativistic beaming .",
    "nevertheless , it can be still above detection threshold if the viewing angle is not much larger than the jet semi - aperture , especially if the burst is at low redshift .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that off - axis jets might indeed dominate the low luminosity end of the observed population .",
    "the idea that nearby low luminosity grbs could be off - axis events has been a subject of debate since the observation of grb980425 .",
    "@xcite rejected such possibility , based on radio observations of grb980425 and grb031203 , but soon later @xcite presented an off - axis model for the afterglow of grb031203 which seems to fit better the observations ( including radio ) with respect to the usual on - axis modelling . using the same off - axis afterglow model , @xcite extended the argument to two x - ray flashes , thus including them in the category of off - axis grbs .",
    "based on prompt emission properties , an off - axis jet interpretation of x - ray flashes had been already proposed by @xcite and @xcite , following the work by @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the off - axis interpretation of grb031203 and grb980425 is not practicable , because their true energy would then be on the very high end of the distribution , implying a very low likelihood when combined with the low redshift of these two events .",
    "more recently , the idea that such events are members of a separate class ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has gained popularity .",
    "our results about the grb luminosity function @xcite , though , still point towards the unification of these events with ordinary grbs based on the off - axis viewing angle argument . with the present work we address the issue from another point of view , by focusing on the apparently single pulsed , smooth behaviour of prompt emission light curves of these bursts , trying to figure out if such behaviour is expected in the case of an off - axis viewing angle .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : pulses - building - blocks ] we explain why an off - axis grb is always less variable than the same grb seen on - axis ; in  [ sec : pulse - light - curves ] we discuss the main assumptions of our simple pulse model and we present the predictions for an on - axis (  [ sec : onaxis - jet ] ) and an off - axis observer (  [ sec : offaxis - jet ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : multipulse ] we build a superposition of pulses ( to represent a synthetic prompt emission light curve ) and show how its properties change with increasing off - axis viewing angle , comparing them with those found in light curve time resolved spectral analysis .",
    "as expected , the model predicts that variability is suppressed in off - axis grbs because of pulse broadening and overlap . in  [ sec : n_offaxis ] off - axis grbs are shown to be a significant fraction of nearby observed grbs .",
    "based on the obtained results , we conclude (  [ sec : low - lum - grbs ] ) that light curves of low luminosity grbs are consistent with the off - axis hypothesis .",

    "this causes the pulses to overlap as seen by the off - axis observer .",
    "[ fig : pointsources ] ]    in a highly variable light curve , pulses must be short and not overlap too much . if pulses are produced at a typical radius by material moving close to the speed of light , then the amount of overlap can depend on the viewing angle . to see this ,",

    "the difference in pulse start times @xmath5 , on the other hand , is not affected by the viewing angle , because the emission of both pulses begins at the same radius : it can be thought of as emission from a source at rest ( for what concerns arrival times ) .",

    "the flux of the single pulse is reduced by @xmath33 , but the flux in the overlapped region is higher by a factor of two , so that the peak flux effectively decreases by @xmath34 .    , and",
    "the rise to decay time ratio is 1:3 .",
    "the start times of the pulses are the same for the two light curves and have been sampled from a log - normal distribution with mean @xmath35 and sigma @xmath36 .",
    "pulses in the lower light curve are broadened by a factor of @xmath37 and their flux is lowered by a factor of @xmath38 with respect to the upper light curve , which corresponds to the effect of an off - axis viewing angle @xmath39 as discussed in the text.[fig : multipulse - simple ] ]    the purpose of this simple argument is to show that if pulses are produced by material moving at relativistic speed , and if a typical emission radius exists , then the apparent variability of the light curve can be significantly smeared out by pulse overlap as seen by an off - axis observer ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : multipulse - simple ] ) .",
    "the viewing angle needed for this to happen is still small enough for the flux not to be heavily suppressed by relativistic ( de-)beaming .",
    "one may argue that the probability to have a viewing angle in the right range for this to happen without falling below the limiting flux of the instrument is vanishingly small . to address this point , in  [ sec : n_offaxis ] we give an estimate of the rate of such events , showing that a significant fraction ( @xmath40 ) of nearby bursts ( @xmath1 ) are likely observed with @xmath41 .",
    "being based solely on geometry and relativity , the above argument does not rely on a specific scenario , e.g.internal shocks .",

    "* ) or beyond ( e.g.magnetic reconnection models , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) eventually must take into account the pulse overlap as seen by off - axis observers .",
    "the pulse width in grb light curves is roughly constant throughout the burst duration @xcite . the internal shock scenario @xcite provides a natural framework for the understanding of this kind of behaviour . in this scenario ,",
    "discontinuous activity in the central engine produces a sequence of shells with different lorentz factors .",
    "when faster shells catch up with slower ones , shocks develop and particles are heated .",
    "if the plasma is optically thin and some magnetic field is present , the energy gained by the electrons is promptly and efficiently radiated away by synchrotron ( and inverse compton ) emission .",
    "each pulse is thus the result of the merger of two shells beyond the photospheric radius @xmath42 .",
    "the strength of the shock , and thus the efficiency of the electron heating , depends strongly on the relative lorentz factor of the merging shells ( a radiative efficiency of a few percent is achieved only for @xmath43 , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "shell pairs with small relative lorentz factors merge later ( they need more time to catch up with each other ) , thus the highest efficiency is achieved for shells merging just after the photospheric radius .",
    "this explains , within this framework , why the typical pulse width is not seen to grow with time : the bulk of the emission happens at a fixed radius , regardless of the expansion of the jet head .",
    "three main time scales arise in the internal shock scenario :    * the electron cooling time @xmath44 , i.e.the time needed by electrons to radiate away most of the energy gained from the shock ; * the angular time scale @xmath45 , i.e.the difference in arrival time between photons emitted at different latitudes ; * the shell crossing time @xmath46 , i.e.the time needed for the two shells to merge .    the electron cooling time",

    "@xcite .",
    "the angular time scale arises when one takes into account the arrival time difference of photons emitted at the same time by parts of the shell at different latitudes .",
    "it is defined as the arrival time difference between a pair of photons , one emitted at zero latitude and the other at @xmath55 latitude .",
    "given a typical photospheric radius @xcite @xmath56  cm , this difference is @xmath57  s  @xmath58 ( we adopt the notation @xmath59 in cgs units ) .",
    "the shell crossing time is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the typical shell width . being linked to the central engine activity , one may assume @xmath61 to be of the order of a few schwarzschild radii .",
    "the schwarzschild radius of a @xmath62 black hole is @xmath63  cm , thus an estimate might be @xmath64  s  @xmath65 . in this case , we have @xmath66 , i.e.the effect of shell curvature dominates over ( i.e.smears out ) intrinsic luminosity variations due to shock dynamics , which take place over the @xmath67 time scale or less .    temporal analysis of grb light curves , though , along with simple modelling of internal shocks @xcite , seem to indicate that the shell width must be comparable to the initial shell separation . taking the two as equal , the time needed for two shells to collide is the same as the shell crossing time , and thus the shell merger is completed within a doubling of the radius . in this case , the shell crossing time and the angular time scale are the same @xcite .",
    "this means that details of the pulse shape and spectral evolution can not be explained as just being due to the shell curvature effect .",
    "indeed , discrepancies between predictions based on shell curvature only and observations have been pointed out ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the description of the pulse in terms of shell curvature qualitatively reproduces the main features of many long grb pulses , namely the fast rise and slower decay , the hard - to - soft spectral evolution , and the presence of a hardness - intensity correlation @xcite .",
    "for this reason , since we focus on the effect of the viewing angle rather than on details of the pulse , in what follows we set up a simple model of the pulse based on the shell curvature effect only .",
    "based on the arguments outlined in ",
    "[ sec : timescales ] , we assume that the variation of the flux seen by the observer during a single pulse is due only to the angular time delay described above . the luminosity @xmath68 of the shell is assumed constant during an emission time @xmath69 and zero before and after this time interval .",
    "the emitting region is assumed geometrically and optically thin . the emitted spectrum , as measured by a locally comoving observer , is assumed to be the same for any shell fluid element .",
    "@xcite and other authors already provided the necessary formulas for the computation of the pulse shape in this case .",
    "for the ease of the reader , and for the purpose of developing an intuitive physical description of the results , though , we will go through some details of the derivation anyway , hereafter and in the appendix .",
    "let the radius of the shell be @xmath70 at the beginning of the emission and @xmath71 at the end of it . the bolometric flux @xmath72 ( specific flux @xmath73 ) is computed by integration of the intensity @xmath74 ( specific intensity @xmath75 ) over the appropriate equal arrival time surface @xmath76 , namely @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the distance between the element @xmath79 of @xmath76 and the observer .",
    "assuming isotropic emission in the comoving frame , in the approximation of infinitesimal shell thickness , the intensity is related to the comoving one ( primed quantities throughout the paper will always refer to the comoving frame ) through @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 for the specific intensity ) .",
    "note that the constant luminosity assumption implies @xmath82 : this is consistent if the number of emitting particles is constant despite the increase of the surface area with the expansion .",

    "this is mainly a consequence of two assumptions : ( i ) that the emission is isotropic in the comoving frame and ( ii ) that all pulses are produced around a typical radius . by relaxing ( i ) , i.e.allowing for a strongly anisotropic emission in the comoving frame , one could reduce ( in case the anisotropy favours forward emission ) or enhance ( in case the anisotropy favours backwards emission ) the flux received by off - axis observers . by relaxing ( ii ) , on the other hand",
