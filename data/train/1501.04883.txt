    "after the remarkable discovery of higgs by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaboration and confirmation in @xcite that it is standard model ( sm ) higgs , one important question arises .",
    "is there any room for new physics ( np ) beyond sm ?",
    "no doubt sm predictions have been verified experimentally to the highest level of precision @xcite@xcite .",
    "but , along with other limitations , sm lacks any explanation for a possible pattern for particle mass , known as mass hierarchy problem .",
    "sm can not predict top quark mass without experimental evidence .",
    "the experiments on b meson @xcite@xcite@xcite are also giving some cracks in standard model .",
    "we are yet unable to explain dark matter and matter anti - matter asymmetry .",
    "gravity is not included in the sm .",
    "theoretically sm is thought to be unsatisfactory and there can be some new particles as well as new interactions .",
    "it has been believed that standard model is a low energy approximation of more general theory .",
    "so , many theoretical extensions of sm has been presented .",
    "but , so far , the only concrete evidence against it has been provided by the neutrino oscillations @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . to explore np",
    "the study of mesonic rare decays involving neutrinos in final state , can be interesting .",
    "these decays proceeds through flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , highly suppressed @xcite due to gim mechanism @xcite and occur at loop level @xcite@xcite .",
    "the discrepancies between experiments and theory ( sm ) for such reactions provide us an excellent window towards np .",
    "new particles can be added in the loops to improve theory or we can have new interactions .",
    "so , fcnc reactions involving neutrinos in the final state can be interesting .",
    "theoretically , @xmath13 and @xmath5 thought to be more clean than @xmath14because it has only top quark contribution and no contribution from charm sector .",
    "non standard neutrino interactions ( nsis ) of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are studied in @xcite and @xcite respectively and constrained are found for @xmath10 .",
    "the nsis constraints for three generations of quarks are given in @xcite  as all of these have same loop structure , so , similar thing should happen to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "two more loop level processes useful for the search of new physics are inclusive @xmath2 and exclusive @xmath19due to their theoretical cleanliness @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we the scheme of study is as : first of all we  give experimental status of @xmath20 and @xmath2 then we revise the sm contribution of these reaction .",
    "next , we study these reactions in nsis with @xmath12 quark in the loop which is the usual case of nsis and obtain the constraints @xmath21",
    ". then we modify the operators for @xmath22 and @xmath23 quarks . and find out the constraints @xmath24and @xmath25we compare these constraints among the three generations .",
    "we also compare these constraints to the constraints of same type of reactions from d and k decays .",
    "then discussion and results are provided and conclusion is given at the end .",
    "@xmath27 decays are being studied in the detectors like cleo , cdf , babar , belle , aleph collaborations and lhcb but the decays involving neutrinos in the final state will be tested at super @xmath27 factories in experimentally clean environment .",
    "the detection of @xmath13 is a hard task and currently we have only experimental bound for this reaction but this will be in the range of super @xmath27 factories .",
    "the experimental bound is given in the table @xmath28 along@xmath29with@xmath29their sm prediction .",
    "current experimental bounds for this are @xmath30but our experience with @xmath15 guide us that the experimental value should be of the order of @xmath31it means we are not discarding the sm values but just searching for the small room for new physics.@xmath29experimental value for @xmath18 is @xmath32@xcite .",
    "@xmath33 is easy to measure experimentally because we have vector particle in the final state , so polarization does matter and its latest bound is @xmath34    inclusive process @xmath2 are very difficult to observe experimentally because we need to tag all the particles involve in @xmath35 along with missing neutrinos .",
    "the limit available till to date is @xmath36 , given in table 1 with reference .      here",
    "mass of @xmath38 @xmath39 mass of @xmath40and both are representing the mesons .",
    "the sm calculation can be divided into two categories , short distance and long distance .. this can be found from @xcite @xcite @xcite and @xcite that the dominant contribution for @xmath41 comes from short distance because long distance contribution is @xmath42less than short distance , if the quark level process is @xmath43 @xmath44 or @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "the quark level process for our decay is  @xmath43 @xmath47 which can be represented by the feynman diagrams shown in figure 1 .    c:/users / admin / desktop / figures / nq142700__1.jpg    in such reactions we can easily separate hadronic interactions from leptonic interaction . for @xmath27",
    "decays the dominant contribution comes from the short distance just like @xmath48 decays and we use perturbation theory due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for such reactions quark level reaction will be @xmath49    where @xmath50 in the subscript represents the vector and axial vector current respectively . for such reactions charm quark contribution in the loop is negligible in contrast to @xmath48 decay due to smallness of off diagonal @xmath51 element and @xmath52 is the loop integral of top - quark exchange @xcite . for this reaction",
    "we have two penguin and one box diagram @xcite and sum of all give the contribution @xmath53\\ ] ]    here @xmath54and @xmath55 is qcd small distance correction . by using above hamiltonian",
    "we can obtain br as @xmath56 @xmath57 is the isospin breaking effect for b. it is discussed for @xmath48 mesons in @xcite which depends on at least three things @xmath58 mass effect @xmath59 a suppression of about @xmath60 in neutral form factor comes from @xmath61 mixing and @xmath62  about @xmath63 suppression due to absence of log leading correction .",
    "the reaction @xmath64proceed through quark level process @xmath65 and the effective hamiltonian is same except to replace @xmath66 with @xmath45 . here",
    "we do not have a tree level reaction for normalization so we have to use @xmath67 @xmath68    for @xmath2 again the effective hamiltonian is same except to replace @xmath66 with @xmath45,and we do not have a tree level process like @xmath69 .",
    "so we have to normalize with the process @xmath70 and due to different phase spaces for @xmath35 and @xmath71we have to include other factors .",
    "the br  will be @xmath72    where @xmath73 with @xmath74    and @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "a useful discussion can about the factors can be found in @xcite and @xcite . with the latest values of the constants we have the br @xmath77 @xmath18",
    "along with @xmath78 is thought to be theoretically clean reactions for the search of new physics .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath79 can be written as @xmath80 and the br can be extracted by normalizing with tree level reaction , so that all the hadronic uncertainties are absorbed @xmath81 here isospin symmetry is exploited as @xmath82 and isospin breaking effect is @xmath83 , and other values from @xcite are used to obtained the br @xmath84      the nsi for the process is shown by the fig 2    c:/users / admin / desktop / figures / nq142701__2.jpg    and represented by@xmath85    we use @xmath86 and @xmath87 to find out br @xmath88    although the current experimental results of @xmath27 decays are narrowing the gape between theory and experiments but when we will get more precise experimental data than we will need more accurate theoretical results . with the assumption that experiments will give us the value of 10@xmath89we",
    "can constraint the nsis from this reaction . as @xmath90 and @xmath91  can be any lepton we take them as @xmath92because for other leptons we have already more precise constraints @xcite .",
    "similarly nsis br of @xmath93 can be found as @xmath94      for all above decays the dominant contribution is coming from the interference between the sm and nsis .",
    "the br of interference are obtained as@xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100    the contribution from interference for @xmath27 decays is is so large as compared to the nsis that nsis effects can easily be ignored . so that the bounds on the constraints are obtained from the interference only .",
    "but for the @xmath101 @xmath102the @xmath103 is @xmath42less than the @xmath104 , so the contribution is ignored .",
    "the numerical values are given in table 1 and 2 .",
    "for c - quark we have to modify the operators as and obtain the constraints@xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath106    for @xmath2 the br and constraints are @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110      with t - quark we have following operator and constraint @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath112    for @xmath2 the br and constraints are @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116",
    "we study three processes @xmath117 @xmath118(exclusive ) and @xmath119 ( inclusive ) . which are theoretically clean processes .",
    "so , these are ideal for the search of new physics .",
    "very high @xmath120 of @xmath121 and @xmath122 making it very attractive for the experimentalists too .",
    "although , @xmath123 is very difficult to detect but it is much clean as compared to any other rare decay that s why it is studied for the search of new physics .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 and plots are provided in figures 3 , 4,5,6,7 and 8 to make the comparison more clear . the constraints on nsis with the decays of charm and kaon rare decays involving neutrinos in their final states are calculated in @xcite@xcite@xcite , which give very precise constraints @xmath124for the up type quarks . for the charm and kaons",
    "the interference between the standard model and nsis is very small , @xmath125 less than @xmath126 .",
    "but , for the case of @xmath27 rare decays having two neutrinos in their final state the dominant contribution is coming from the interference .",
    "one more difference is that for charm and kaons the br of first and second generation are giving higher values , but , for b the contribution from second and third generation is providing leading contribution as compared to the first generation .",
    "as for as the comparison with in the generation is concerned we are getting more precise constraints with second generation of quarks ( c quark ) for b , d and k rare decays having neutrino in final state .",
    "but , the constrains from @xmath27 decays are less precise for @xmath12-quark than d and k decays .",
    "it is contrary to the usual nsis , in which the dominate contribution comes from @xmath12-quark induced processes .",
    "the rare b decays will be in the range of much clean environment of the b factories .",
    "that s why the analysis of such reaction is very important for the new physics .",
    "we analysis @xmath127 for the study of nsis with three generations of quarks which provides even be more precise constraints as compared to d and k decays of same type .",
    "the constraint for @xmath128 are @xmath125 for all the generations but the br for third generations is very small and can be ignored .",
    "this is shown in figures 9,10 and 11 .",
