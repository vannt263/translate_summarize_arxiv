    "a complete understanding of the basic building blocks of the universe hinges on understanding the elusive properties of neutrinos . as a result of having extremely weak interactions ,",
    "neutrinos are the least accurately measured of the known fundamental particles . however , even with our limited knowledge of neutrino properties , the fact that they are massive @xcite represents one of the most significant challenges to the standard model of particle physics .",
    "therefore , any improved knowledge of the properties of neutrinos will not only serve to shed new light on a relatively poorly explored aspect of fundamental physics but may also provide further evidence of inadequacies of the standard model . adding urgency to the exploration of the properties of neutrinos , a recent combination of data on anomalous neutrino mixing @xcite along with observations of the neutrino flux from nuclear reactors @xcite has indicated anomalous mixing between neutrino flavors .",
    "an important consequence of these modifications to the neutrino sector is their imprint on cosmological observations . within the standard model ,",
    "a cosmological background of neutrinos is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the other cosmological species for temperatures @xmath5 mev , after which the neutrino background decouples and only interacts through gravity .",
    "neutrinos are thought to comprise a significant fraction of the radiative energy density during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) causing a measurable effect on the abundances of the primordial light elements @xcite as well as during the formation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite .",
    "cosmological observations are able to place precise constraints on the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath6 , defined so that the total radiative energy density is given by @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the energy density in photons .",
    "the cosmological radiative content in addition to the photons is known as the cosmic dark radiation background ( cdrb ) . in the standard cosmological model",
    "the only radiative energy density besides photons are the three known neutrino species so that @xmath9 , with the small correction due to finite temperature qed effects and neutrino flavor mixing @xcite .    greatly adding to the intrigue , a combination of the most current observations of the cmb and lss indicate that @xmath10 at the 99.9% c.l . , with @xmath11 ( 95% c.l .",
    ", see table i ) .",
    "cosmological constraints on @xmath6 are insensitive to anything but the total energy density contained in the cdrb .",
    "most radiative backgrounds , including neutrinos , share the property that they are ` non - interacting ' , i.e. , they only interact with other cosmological species through gravity .",
    "examples of such backgrounds include axions @xcite and short - wavelength gravitational - waves @xcite .",
    "any further interpretation of finding @xmath10 requires information on other properties of the anomalous radiative energy density .",
    "here we constrain the values of two additional parameters which determine the properties of the cdrb : the rest - frame sound speed , @xmath12 , and a viscosity parameter , @xmath13 @xcite . as we will describe further , a standard , non - interacting",
    ", radiative background has @xmath14 .",
    "however , if the cdrb is composed of any non - standard species with significant interactions these parameters can take on different values ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) which can have a significant impact on the observed cmb power spectrum , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cls ] .",
    "if both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are found to be consistent with their standard value of @xmath15 this would lend weight to the interpretation that observations indicate the existence of extra relativistic , non - interacting ( i.e. , neutrino - like ) degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "if either is found to be inconsistent with their standard values , any inferred anomalous radiative energy density can not be composed of standard neutrinos ( and may actually be the result of unaccounted for systematic effects ) .",
    "several previous studies have looked at observational constraints on neutrino interactions @xcite . in particular , refs .",
    "@xcite have used measurements of the cmb and lss to constrain the value of @xmath13 . however , this is the first study to place a constraint on the rest - frame sound speed , @xmath12 .",
    "constraints on @xmath12 are particularly interesting since models of neutrino interactions indicate it can differ from its canonical value by @xmath16 ( e.g. ,  ref .",
    "@xcite ) and _ current _ observations can constrain its value to @xmath17 at the 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) . additionally , we report significantly improved constraints on @xmath13 by using the most recent measurements of the cmb and lss lowering the uncertainty on @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "the modified evolution equations for the neutrino perturbations are @xcite @xmath19 where the dot indicates a derivative with respect to conformal time , @xmath20 is the scale - factor , @xmath21 is the wavenumber , @xmath12 is the rest - frame sound - speed , @xmath13 is a viscosity parameter , @xmath22 is the neutrino density contrast , @xmath23 is the neutrino velocity perturbation , @xmath24 is the neutrino anisotropic stress , @xmath25 are higher order moments of the neutrino distribution function , the shear , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the scalar metric perturbations in synchronous gauge @xcite , and the higher order moments of the distribution function are truncated with appropriate boundary conditions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we note that the modified evolution equations imply a modified set of initial conditions for the perturbation equations since neutrinos are a significant fraction of the total radiative energy density at early times when the initial conditions are set . following the derivation outlined in ref .  @xcite we set the initial conditions to the growing mode which reverts to the standard adiabatic mode when @xmath29 as shown in appendix a.    varying @xmath13 modifies the ability for neutrinos to free - stream out of a gravitational potential well @xcite .",
    "when @xmath30 the cdrb becomes a perfect fluid and is capable of supporting undamped acoustic oscillations , shown in red ( dot - dashed ) on the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : evo ] .",
    "an increased @xmath13 leads to an overdamping of the perturbations , shown in blue ( dashed ) in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : evo ] .    changing @xmath12 allows for a neutrino pressure perturbation which is non - adiabatic , i.e. , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the density perturbation in a frame where the neutrino velocity perturbation , @xmath33 .",
    "a value of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) leads to a decreased ( increased ) pressure for the cdrb in its rest - frame , which in turn causes the amplitude of the neutrino density perturbations to increase ( decrease ) , as seen on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : evo ] in the red , dot - dashed ( blue , dashed ) curve .",
    "this parameterization is related to a scenario in which neutrinos have a significant interaction cross - section . as an example , if neutrinos tightly couple to a perfect fluid then @xmath30 and an analogy can be made between our parameterization and the tightly coupled photon - baryon fluid with a constant sound speed , @xmath36 , related to @xmath0 through , @xmath37 .",
    "we show how the cmb temperature power - spectrum is modified in this parameterization in fig .",
    "[ fig : cls ] . note that an increase ( decrease ) in @xmath12 leads to an increase ( decrease ) in the scales at which the neutrino perturbations affect the cmb .",
    "this is due to the increase ( decrease ) in the the neutrino sound horizon .",
    "these parameters have a similar effect on the polarization power - spectrum , not shown here .",
    "however , since the effects of the cdrb perturbations are negligible by the time large - scale structure forms , the change to the matter power - spectrum is negligible @xcite .",
    "in order to measure these parameters we used a modified version of the publicly available boltzmann code , camb @xcite along with the publicly available monte carlo markov chain code , cosmomc @xcite .",
    "we used a combination of cmb and lss data including wmap7 @xcite , acbar @xcite , act @xcite , spt @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr7 lrg matter power spectrum @xcite , the sdss small - scale matter power - spectrum measured from the lyman - alpha forest @xcite and the latest determination of the hubble parameter , @xmath38 , using the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "in addition to various combinations of @xmath39 we allowed the standard six cosmological parameters , @xmath40 , to vary , where @xmath41 is the amplitude of the primordial power - spectrum , @xmath42 is the spectral index , @xmath43 is the optical depth , @xmath44 is the angular acoustic scale of the cmb , @xmath27 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the baryon density in units of the critical density , and @xmath47 is the dark matter density in units of the critical density .",
    "all constraints , except where noted , force the helium fraction , @xmath48 , to be fixed by its bbn relationship to @xmath49 and @xmath6 @xcite . we note that this parameterization only takes into account how a change in @xmath6 causes a change in the expansion rate during bbn .",
    "if the change in @xmath6 is due to a change in the physics of the neutrino sector the functional form @xmath50 may not hold .",
    "we also consider a case where @xmath48 is an additional free parameter as discussed below .",
    "a summary of our results can be found in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "varying the number of effective neutrino species , @xmath6 , with @xmath29 we recover a preference for an anomalous radiative energy density at the @xmath51 c.l .",
    "when we allow @xmath13 and @xmath12 to vary as well , the significance of any anomalous radiative energy density changes to 97.2% c.l . additionally , the marginalized mean value of @xmath52 is lower than the expected value of 1/3 at the 87.5% c.l .",
    "therefore , as shown by the blue circle in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] , the standard value of @xmath53 is still disfavored at higher than the 95% c.l .    since a change in @xmath12 introduces a new length - scale ( the neutrino sound - horizon ) its affect on the cmb is only slightly correlated with the other parameters .",
    "this scale - dependence is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cls ] around the first peak .",
    "because of its lack of strong correlations , the observations place a precise constraint on @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] .",
    "constraints to @xmath1 are not as precise because its affect on the cmb is scale - free leading to a degeneracy with , for example , the scalar spectral index , @xmath42 , shown on the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] .",
    "given the tentative evidence for an anomalously large radiative energy density , it is of interest to consider the case where the number of neutrinos ( with @xmath54 ) is fixed to three and to constrain the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 applied to an additional one or two effective species .",
    "we show the results of this analysis in table i.    marginalized 1d constraints +    .[tab : results ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notes.errors are 68% , 95% c.l . ; upper limits are 95% c.l .",
    "+ @xmath55 for these chains , the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom with @xmath56 is fixed to three while @xmath1 and @xmath0 applied to one or two extra degrees of freedom are allowed to vary .    since both @xmath13 and @xmath12 modulate the amplitude of small - scale power in the cmb we explored degeneracies with the running of the spectral index , @xmath57 . excluding the lyman - alpha data and fixing @xmath58 we find , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . allowing both @xmath13 and @xmath12 to vary we find @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63and @xmath64 .",
    "although there are many radiative backgrounds which are unrelated to neutrinos , if the anomalous cdrb is explained by a modification to neutrino physics this may lead to a change the functional form of @xmath50 .",
    "therefore it is important to consider the case where @xmath48 is an additional free parameter .",
    "fixing @xmath58 we find @xmath65 and @xmath66 which is in slight ( @xmath671.5@xmath68 ) disagreement with astrophysical measurements @xcite and bbn predictions for @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "however , when we also allow @xmath13 and @xmath12 to vary , the helium fraction preferred by the data decreases to @xmath69 which is in good agreement with the most recent astrophysical measurements , @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "we find the number of effective neutrino species is @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "using the astrophysical measurement of @xmath48 as a prior we find @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "we note that our modified perturbation equations only apply to massless degrees of freedom .",
    "however , since a non - zero mass predominately affects the late - time ( post - recombination ) evolution of the perturbations , its effects are separated in time ( and hence we expect should be fairly uncorrelated ) from the effects of varying @xmath13 and @xmath12 , which are most important before and during recombination .",
    "we leave a simultaneous constraint on the neutrino mass , @xmath13 and @xmath12 to future work .",
    "we have used current cmb and lss data to explore various properties of perturbations in the cdrb . in particular , we have parameterized the evolution of the neutrino perturbations with two additional parameters : a rest - frame sound speed , @xmath0 , and a viscosity parameter @xmath1 , which both equal 1/3 for the standard , non - interacting , cdrb . with @xmath77",
    "we find that current data favors an anomalously large standard cdrb energy density at the 99.9% c.l .. when @xmath13 and @xmath12 are allowed to vary the data still shows that the standard value @xmath78 is disfavored at slightly greater than the 95% c.l .",
    "relative to the 2d - marginalized contours .",
    "our results can be interpreted as providing tentative evidence that the extra relativistic degrees of freedom seen in observations of the cmb may have non - negligible interactions with @xmath34 at the 87.5% c.l .",
    "although , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] , this result is driven by the small - scale observations of the cmb and may be impacted by systematic errors , such as issues related to marginalizing over sources of secondary anisotropies .",
    "a more conclusive result must wait for data from future observations , such as the planck satellite @xcite .",
    "if any anomalous radiative energy density is due to a modification of the neutrino sector this may result in a change to the standard relationship @xmath50 .",
    "allowing the helium fraction to also vary we find that the constraint on @xmath48 is in agreement with the most recent astrophysical measurements @xcite .",
    "in addition the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are consistent with their non - interacting value of 1/3 and @xmath6 is larger than the expected value of 3 at the 90% c.l . using the astrophysical measurement of @xmath48 as a prior",
    "we find @xmath10 at the 95 % c.l .",
    ", @xmath1 is fully consistent with the expected value of 1/3 , and @xmath0 is less than 1/3 at the @xmath79 c.l .",
    "therefore we find that although fixing the helium fraction through its bbn relationship @xmath50 may not be appropriate in general , when we allow @xmath48 to be a free parameter the constraint on @xmath6 is still significantly anomalous .",
    "using the astrophysical measurement as a prior on @xmath48 only increases this significance and hints at a slightly low value for @xmath0 .    using a fisher analysis",
    "we find that future observations of the cmb with the planck satellite alone will provide a measurement of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "if future observations continue to provide evidence for the presence of extra relativistic energy density then , when applied to one additional effective neutrino degree of freedom , planck will constrain @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the improved sensitivity to these parameters will allow a constraint on the fundamental properties of any new radiative degrees of freedom .    _ note added in proof : _ after a preprint of this paper appeared on the arxiv we became aware of a study , ref .",
