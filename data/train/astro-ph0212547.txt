    "arp 194n and arp 194s are therefore separated by a projected linear distance @xmath8 34 kpc ( 1 arcsec corresponds to @xmath9 850 pc ) .",
    "arp described the arp 194 system as belonging to the class of `` galaxies with material ejected from nuclei . ''",
    "arp noted further `` outer material connected by thin filament to very hard nucleus . '' several peculiar features of arp 194n ( @xmath0 a194n ) have been also discussed in an early study ( metlov 1980 ) .",
    "theoretical modeling involving a reliable treatment of dissipative phenomena like star formation , as well as high resolution numerical simulations of stellar and gas motions are still the current frontier in our understanding of interacting galaxies ( see e.g. , hearn & lamb 2001 ; semelin & combes 2000 ; barnes & hernquist 1998 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) . from simulations , we expect a wide range of phenomenological properties due to interaction .",
    "gravitational forces can marginally enhance the star formation rate ( sfr ) in an unbound intergalactic encounter as well as give rise to the most luminous bursts of star formation observed in merging systems ( see e.g. , krongold et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "tidal effects drive noncircular motion in disk galaxies , can strip a significant amount of stars and gas , and even lead to the formation of the so - called tidal - dwarf galaxies ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ) . a related issue is the role of gravitational interaction in fueling nonthermal nuclear activity . both simulations and observations of single interacting systems are a necessary complement to statistical studies on the frequency of interacting systems among active galaxies , since the latter provide valuable but only circumstantial evidence in favor of interaction as a major driver of nuclear activity ( krongold et al . 2002 ; see however schmitt 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "collisional ring galaxies are excellent laboratories for studying galactic evolution , global star formation , and the occurrence of gas cross - fueling among galaxies .",
    "the prototype of this class of objects is the cartwheel galaxy a0035 - 33 .",
    "only few systems similar to this object are known : among the best studied we recall vii  zw  466 , arp 10 , ii zw 28 , ii hz 4 , abell 76 , lt 36 , ngc 985 , lt 41 ( appleton & marston 1997 ) .",
    "other likely cases are arp 119 ( hearn & lamb , 2001 ) , arp 118 ( charmandaris et al . 2001 ) , arp 284 ( smith & wallin 1992 , smith et al .",

    "the dominant ring morphology is thought to result from a head - on collision between two galaxies , one of which traveled close to the spin axis of the other , striking the disk close to its center .",
    "the resulting gravitational perturbation is believed to drive a set of symmetrical waves or caustics through the stellar disk ( lynds & toomre 1976 , theys & spiegel 1976 , toomre 1978 , appleton & struck - marcell 1987 , struck - marcell 1990 ) .",
    "computer simulations of such head - on encounters , in which at least one galaxy has a significant gaseous component , show indeed the production of density enhancements and shock waves in the interstellar medium .",
    "these high density regions coincide with the location of recent , large scale star formation observed in ring galaxies .",

    "several photometric properties indicate star formation rates typical of starburst galaxies (  [ sform ] ) .",
    "the surprisingly strong radio emission from a194s and knot a is likely due mainly to supernova remnants which imply even higher star formation rates (  [ rsn ] ) and substantial internal obscuration",
    ". relatively rare systems like arp 194 where gas motions are induced by a head - on encounter enable us to unambiguously infer the geometry of the system . in this case that information provides evidence for `` cross - fueling '' ( see  [ int ] ) .",

    "the uncertainty associated to the overall +  calibration is estimated to be within 10 % . due to the diffuse nature of large part of  emission , an appropriate uncertainty is probably a factor 2 for the measurements on the faintest and most diffuse regions , while it should be within 20 % for the brightest and least diffuse ones .",
    "a194s is a surprisingly strong radio source when compared to nearby seyfert galaxies .",

    "of course this is still negligible compared to nearby radio galaxies such as ngc 1275 with @xmath21 25.6 ( owen et al .",
    "1980 ) .",
    "another remarkable feature of this system is a string of relatively bright knots ( `` blobs '' ) in between the two components of arp 194 , aligned along the north western direction ( the `` streamers '' in the terminology of metlov 1980 ) .",
    "the blobs b and c have b  r@xmath4 0.12 and 0.26 respectively . in table",
    "[ tab : mf ] , the j and k magnitudes are upper limits from the isophotal contours published by bushouse & stanford ( 1992 )",
    ". the blobs are not present at the lowest contour levels traced by these authors .",
    "the trail of blobs between a194s and a194n can be readily interpreted as stripped gas due to the interpenetrating encounter between a194s and a194n ( see marziani et al .",
    "1994 ; horellou & combes 2000 ) .",
    "there are several lines of evidence in favor of this interpretation :    * the rough alignment of the three main blobs observed in between a194s and a194n .",
    "the blobs literally provide a trail of `` footprints '' tracing the path of the intruding galaxy ( a194s ) after crossing a194n .",
    "they identify a direction pointing close to the geometrical center of a194n ; * the lack of any k counterpart for all blobs , which suggests a common origin for the blobs .",
    "in particular , it rules out that blob a is a background galaxy ; * almost no solution of continuity nor any radial velocity discontinuity emission in the 2d spectra at p. a. 145@xmath13  ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pa145bw ] and  [ rv ] ) ; * several features of a194n , which can can be ascribed to a collisional ring , as discussed below .    following the collision interpretation",
    "we might expect arp194 to show features predicted by models for off - center interpenetrating encounters including : ( 1 ) a prominent outer ring and ( 2 ) displacement of mass toward the ring ( gerber et al .",
    "1992 ; see also the k images of several ring galaxies in appleton & marston 1997 ) .",
    "a194n can be interpreted as a distorted ring galaxy although tracing the outer ring is not easy .",
    "two arcs towards the south and north can be traced unambiguously , suggesting a ring of radius @xmath22 17 kpc .",
    "the hollow region towards the se reinforces the collisional ring galaxy interpretation because it can not be easily explained in other terms .",
    "another supporting element involves the trend in radial velocities along p.a.=145@xmath13 , which can be more easily explained as the result of expansion than rotation ( see  [ rv ] ) .",
    "a194s shows a larger and brighter nuclear bulge suggesting that it is an earlier morphological type ( sa - sb ? ) than n ( originally type sc ? ) .",
    "two blue arc - like features ( fig .",

    "they may be signatures of a ring - like expansion wave produced by the assumed head on encounter between a194n and s.    interpretation of a194n is complicated by the complex morphology on the north - western side .",
    "two main condensations ( corresponding roughly to a194n - a and a194n - b ) are visible in the k images",
    ". this may indicate that we are detecting the nucleus of n and another galaxy projected nearby ( i.e. a194n + an additional perturber ) .",
    "the color map reddest region to the north ( @xmath23 ) may be associated to such a perturber .",

    "this implies that _ the tidally stripped matter making blob a was , in origin , predominantly gaseous_.      radio emission in star forming galaxies is expected from three major sources : ( 1 ) radio supernov  ( rsn ) , ( 2 ) supernova remnants ( snrs ) , and ( 3 ) cosmic ray electrons injected through the fermi acceleration mechanism in the interstellar medium ( see , e.g. , condon 1992 for an excellent review ) .",
    "we can write the emitted power as a function of time as @xmath79 , where the integration in summed over the three main radio emission mechanisms , and @xmath80  is the number of supernov  per year , and we assume that the age of the starburst is longer than the maximum @xmath81 yr ( see below ) .    a notable example of radio - emitting supernova has been the rsn ( with a type ibc progenitor ) discovered in the circumnuclear starburst region of ngc 7469 , a seyfert 1 galaxy ( colina et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the conditions of ngc 7469 may be ultimately similar to the ones of a194s - a .",
    "however , unless a starburst is extremely young , rsnae due to type ii events should dominate the radio luminosity contribution due to snae .",
    "we consider as representative one of the best studied cases , sn 1979c in m100 .",
    "the luminosity is an order of magnitude less than rsn ngc 7469 , @xmath82 , and the light curve can be modeled as flat for a time @xmath83 2 yr with a sharp rise and steep decline ( see also yin & heeshen 1991 ; mioduszewski et al .",
    "this seems to be , at present , a reasonable albeit rough assumption .",
    "the contribution due to snr , @xmath84  is a strong function of time .",
    "the snr diameter depends on time as @xmath85 , where d is in pc and t in years ( clark & caswell 1976 ; see e.g. , ulvestad 1982 ) up to a @xmath86 yr . @xmath87  is the total energy of a sn , and @xmath88  is the electron density of the circumstellar medium ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath90 ergs @xmath91 .",
    "we consider the observational surface brightness @xmath92 vs. d relationship in the form @xmath93 w m@xmath94 hz@xmath3 sr@xmath3  ( ulvestad 1982 , and references therein ) . assuming a power law index 0.8 typical of type ii snae ( weiler et al",
    "1986 ; colina et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) , we obtain that the total power emitted at 1.4 ghz by a snr as a function of time is @xmath95 .",
    "a third term is due to relativistic electrons injected by supernova shocks in the interstellar medium .",
    "these  cosmic ray \" electrons are thought to account for @xmath67 = 90%   94 %   of the total radio power output from a supernova remnant ( condon 1992 ;",
    "bressan et al .",
    "2002 ) , and may radiate for @xmath96 yr .",
    "assuming @xmath80 independent on time , we obtain a rate @xmath97 sn  yr@xmath3  for the nuclear region , and @xmath98  sn  yr@xmath3  for blob a. the sn rate deduced from radio power is in any case much larger than the value expected from stellar population synthesis , which predicts @xmath99 sn  yr@xmath3  for the nuclear regions of a194s , and @xmath100 sn  yr@xmath3  for blob a. the sn rate deduced from radio is @xmath101 times larger than the sn rate deduced from optical properties .",
    "this hints at ( 1 ) the presence of an agn , which may significantly affect the total power of a194s ; however , this does not seem the case since the ratio between optical and radio sn rate on a194s - a is similar to that of blob a ; at ( 2 ) obscuration ; ( 3 ) a short - lived ( @xmath102 yr ) , post - starburst phase in which the ratio sfr/@xmath63reaches a minimum ( bressan et al .",
    "this is predicted for an impulsive starburst , and is due to the strong enhancement of the radio emission following the supernova explosion of the lowest - mass type - ii supernova progenitors ( which are also the most frequent for standard imfs ) .",
    "obscuration is most likely to play the major role . especially in systems like the nuclear regions of a194s , and blob a which are spheroidal in appearance",
    ",  emission may be detected only from the star forming regions nearer to be observer .",
    "the sfr measured from the fir luminosity is @xmath10310 times larger than the sfr measured from  ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the rate of sn  found from a search in the k band is also a factor @xmath2 510 then the rate estimated from optical surveys ( maiolino et al .",
    "2002 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "numerical simulations of head - on collisions between galaxies show that a substantial mass of gas is  splashed out \" into a bridge connecting the two centers of potential . after the collision",
    ", the gas is re - accreted either from the intruder and from the primary disk .",
    "the amount of material pushed out in the collision depends on the relative orientation and impact parameter of the encounter .",
    "the subsequent infall is spatially asymmetric and is primarily located in a well defined streams .",
    "most of the accreted gas ends up in the central regions of the model galaxies ( struck 1997 ) .",
    "however , cross - fueling is definitely not an easy phenomenon to prove observationally . in the framework of a galaxy pair , it implies three physical requirements : ( 1 ) that gas is stripped from one galaxy ; ( 2 ) that the gas , stripped from one galaxy , is falling toward the other ; ( 3 ) that the infalling gas is actually fueling a starburst or an agn .",
    "these three conditions may be met only in very special systems , and may be demonstrable in many fewer .",
    "at least , in the case of collisional ring galaxies systems like arp 194 it is easy to test whether cross fueling is indeed occurring .",
    "first , the blob and the morphology of a194n provide evidence in favor of stripping .",
    "the second condition is also satisfied with reasonable certainty _ for blob a _ ( nothing can be said on blob b and c ) . on blob",
    "a we are observing  and  line components whose redshift is increasing as the gas is approaching the nucleus of a194s .",
    "the third condition is also met , since the sfr@xmath4 4.5 yr@xmath3 for a194s - a and @xmath104yr@xmath3 are typical for estimates of sfr from  luminosity in starburst galaxies .",
    "the emission line feature observed between blob a and a194s in the spectrum at p. a. = 145@xmath13  is not unlike the one observed in ngc 7592 , in which the two interacting galaxies are much closer , and in which a bright  filament connects the nuclei of the two components ( rafanelli & marziani 1992 ; marziani et al .",
    "interpenetrating encounters lead to some easily demonstrable cases of tidal stripping .",
    "al least two other cases have been studied in detail , kar 29 and eso 253-ig026 ( marziani et al .",
    "2001 , marziani et al .",
    "eso 253-ig026 shows an impressive , bright filament connecting the two galactic components .",
    "evidence of cross - fueling has been collected in other galactic pairs , especially in mixed spiral / elliptical pairs in which a starburst has been induced in the early type component : for example , in am 0327 - 285 ( de mello et al . 1995 ; 1996 ) , and in arp 105 ( duc et al .",
    "1997 ; see also domingue 2001 ) . we can study more easily some systems containing a collisional ring galaxy since they are at a special timing after contact and oriented favorably .",
    "even if the conditions are special , they provide a laboratory to study accretion gas flows on 100 pc  kpc scales which can not be obtained as easily in more complex systems like most merging systems .",
    "albeit the blob b and c look slightly fainter than a , it is conceivable that they may be of comparable mass .",
    "the total mass of the blobs can therefore be several 10@xmath1 .",
    "the ejection of stellar and gaseous material into the intergalactic medium and its subsequent rearranging may lead ultimately to the formation of self - gravitating tidal dwarf galaxies ( duc et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this respect",
    ", it is interesting to note that the mass of blob a is within the range of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the arp 194 system shows that a part of the orbital energy can be transferred to the gas motion ( e.g. , marziani et al .",
    "1994 in the case of kar 29 , horellou & combes 2000 ) in the special case of a collisional ring galaxy .",
    "this is expected in general from simulations of interacting galaxies .",
    "orbital energy transfer leads to vertical motions of gas from a system that , when unperturbed , was dynamically very cold with a very low vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "filamentary structures emerging from disk and dwarf galaxies are a telltale signature of superwinds ( see for instance the spectacular case of ngc 1808 ; phillips 1993 ) .",
    "superwinds are currently explained as due to the kinetic energy injected by stellar winds and sn   around compact starburst regions ( e.g. heckman et al . 1993 ; heckman 2001 ) .",
    "this explanation neglects the observational fact that the wide majority of superwind galaxies belong to strongly interacting systems ( marziani & dultzin - hacyan 2000 ) . a rather large fraction of superwind galaxies ( possibly 9 out of 20 , of which 3 with obvious evidence of tidal stripping )",
    "were found in merging systems .",
    "small companions , leading to appreciable perturbations , were also seen near @xmath105 of the superwind galaxies .",
    "also in the case of minor mergers , the velocity dispersion in the inner disk is expected to be significantly increased , and the disk structure to become unstable ( walker et al .",
    ". implications of ongoing interactions  and of gravitationally - induced , non - rotational gas motions  have not been taken into account in the theory of galactic superwinds . even if it is possible to obtain a momentum and energy flow consistent with the observed superwind properties from the mass ejections by stellar wind and sn  ( leitherer et al .",
    "1992 ) , several superwind aspects  including the possibility that the wind matter could escape from the galactic potential well  could be influenced if the out - of - disk flow is eased by tidal forces , since most superwind flows are apparently only `` marginally bound '' ( martin et al .",
    ". there could be important consequences for the enrichment of any intra - cluster medium .",
    "we know the relative velocity between blob a and a194n - a .",
    "we can estimate the kinetic energy of tidally stripped matter as @xmath106 ergs .",
    "this is a lower limit , since the blob mass could well be much larger than estimated .",
    "the kinetic energy imparted to blob a corresponds to the total kinetic energy produced by @xmath107 sn , and it may be still a small fraction of the total superwind energy ( @xmath108 ergs , which corresponds to the total output of 10@xmath109  supernov ) . however , gravitational forces could have still an important impact .",
    "the kinetic energy could easily be much higher , since @xmath110  imparted to the streaming gas could be much larger than the one assumed on the basis of the blob a observations",
    ". the kinetic energy value for tidally stripped matter and superwind outflow can therefore be comparable .",
    "we have shown that at least blob a and b can be thought as being entirely gaseous in origin .",
    "the relevance of arp 194 to the superwind phenomenon is that it demonstrates observationally that gas motions can be perturbed to the point of giving rise to a stream perpendicular to the galactic plane because of gravitational acceleration .",
    "there are other examples of a superwind - like outflow manifestly driven by interactions .",
    "kar 29 is likely to be the result of a high velocity encounter ( @xmath4 1000 ) between an early - type galaxy ( the northern component ) and a late - type spiral ( see hearn & lamb 2001 for a review of observational data on this object ) . the stripped gas emerging from the spiral southern component has not been captured by the elliptical , and may be instead falling back toward the spiral as in a true `` galactic fountain . '' fraternali et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found that the `` galactic fountain ''  motions in the spiral ngc 2403 are difficult to explain in the pure superwind scheme without accounting for interactions . also , van der hulst and sancisi ( 1988 ) suggested that the high velocity  gas moving at high speed perpendicular to the disk of messier 101 could be explained in term of a collision between a large gas mass and the disk of messier 101 itself .",
    "similarly , some high velocity clouds observed in our galaxy are likely due to tidal effect related to the crossing of the galaxy by the large magellanic cloud ( e.g. , wakker & van woerden 1997 ) .",
    "these findings can be understood through the simulations mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we conjecture that , in mergers and in minor mergers , there could be an important effect of gravitational forces on gas motion perpendicular to the original disk plane .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the photometric properties and the kinematics of the strongly interacting system arp 194 .",
    "the main constituents of this system are a collisional ring system ( a194n ) and an intruder ( a194s ) that have experienced an interpenetrating , head - on encounter a few @xmath111 yr ago .",
    "we have shown that tidally stripped gas is falling toward the center of the intruder , a194s , and that it is fueling a strong nuclear and circumnuclear starburst .",
    "arp 194 is therefore one of the few known objects for which convincing evidence of cross - fueling exists . considering that gas is usually confined in a `` dynamically cold '' configuration in disk galaxies , the arp 194 case indicates transfer of orbital energy to the internal motion of gas during the the encounter .",
    "we suggest that gas motions in superwind galaxies  which are mostly interacting systems  could also be affected by the same mechanism .",
    "several aspects of the arp 194 system deserve further scrutiny .",
    "the morphology of a194n is fairly complex , and the distorted morphology of the ring as well as the bright arc of a194n indicate the possibility of perturbations by a third party",
    ". a full coverage with slit spectroscopy will allow to confirm the presence of a second intruder galaxy located approximately in correspondence of the northern side of the ring .",
    "high spatial resolution spectroscopy may reveal more complex motions in proximity of the nucleus of a194s . in the interacting galaxy pair",
    "ngc 1409/10 , the ongoing mass transfer seems to follow a spiraling pattern ( keel 2000 ; similar considerations may apply to ngc 7592 : hattori et al .",
    "there is no indication of an hidden agn presence from our data , but this result depends on the resolution of the first survey data .",
    "it is possible that higher resolution data may reveal a high surface brightness compact core .",
    "in addition , further radio observations could detect radio supernova events : if @xmath112 , and if a radio supernova event remains detectable for @xmath43 yr , we expect to reveal 1 event at any observing time .",

    "<S> we present new imaging and spectroscopic observations of the interacting system arp 194 ( @xmath0 ugc 06945 @xmath0 vv 126 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the northern component ( a194n ) is a distorted spiral or ring galaxy likely disrupted by a collision or close encounter with a southern galaxy ( a194s ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence that a third galaxy with similar recession velocity is projected on a194n but its role is likely secondary . </S>",
    "<S> a194s is connected to a194n by a string of emission knots which motivates our interpretation that the former was the intruder . </S>",
    "<S> three of the knots are easily discernible in b , r , and  images and are assumed to trace the path of the intruder following the encounter , which we estimate occurred a few 10@xmath1 yr ago .    both a194s and n are experiencing strong bursts of star formation : the luminosity indicates a total star formation rate @xmath2 10 yr@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of detectable j and k emission from the blobs , along with strong  emission , indicates that an evolved stellar population is not likely to be present . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest knot ( closest to a194s ) shows a star formation rate of @xmath41.2 yr@xmath3  which , if sustained over a time @xmath4 7@xmath5 yr , could explain the spectral energy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the stripped matter was originally predominantly gaseous . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest knot is detected as a first radio source and this is likely the signature of supernova remnants related to enhanced star formation . </S>",
    "<S> motions in the gas between the brightest knot and a194s , traced by an emission line link of increasing radial velocity , suggests infall toward the center of the intruder . </S>",
    "<S> arp 194 is therefore one of the few galaxies where evidence of `` cross - fueling '' is observed . </S>"
