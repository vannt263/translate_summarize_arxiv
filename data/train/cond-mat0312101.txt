    "the concept of tunneling in the realm of quantum mechanics has gained much attention over many years .",
    "the immense potentiality of this concept has led to the study of various time scales to understand a time the particle takes to tunnel through a barrier  @xcite .",
    "the group delay time associated with potential scattering is one of the important quantities related efficiently to the dynamical aspect of scattering in quantum mechanics .",
    "the time delay for scattering processes can be calculated by following the peak of a wavepacket  @xcite .",
    "the phase delay time ( @xmath0 ) is expressed in terms of the derivative of the phase shift of the scattering matrix with respect to energy . since its inception , wigner phase delay time has been a quantity of interest from fundamental as well as technological point of view .",
    "the delay time statistics is intimately connected with the dynamic admittance of microstructures  @xcite .",
    "this delay time is also directly related to the density of states  @xcite .",
    "the universality of the delay time distributions in random and chaotic systems has been established earlier  @xcite .",
    "the explicit calculation of group delay time in the problem of a particle tunneling through a rectangular barrier becomes independent of the barrier width in the case of an opaque barrier  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , often referred as ` hartman effect ' , implies that for sufficiently large barriers the effective group velocity of the particle inside the barrier can become arbitrarily large  @xcite . in other words",
    ", the evanescent waves can travel with superluminal speeds .",
    "though experiments with electrons for verifying this prediction is yet to be done , the formal identity between the schrdinger equation and the helmholtz equation for electromagnetic wave correlates the results for electromagnetic and microwaves to that of electrons .",
    "photonic experiments show that electromagnetic pulses travel with group velocities in excess of the speed of light in vacuum as they tunnel through a constriction in a waveguide  @xcite .",
    "other experiments with photonic band - gap structures also verified that ` tunneling photons ' travel with superluminal group velocities  @xcite .",
    "thus all these experiments directly or indirectly confirmed the occurence of the hartman effect without violating so called ` einstein causality ' .",
    "operationally , superluminal velocities have been measured in terms of delay time between the appearance of a pulse peak at the input and a pulse peak at the output of a barrier .",
    "it should also be noted that the method based on following the peak of the wavepacket looses its significance under strong distortion of wavepacket  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is no causal relationship between the peak of transmitted wavepacket and that of the incident wavepacket .",
    "this is due to the fact that peak of the transmitted wavepacket can leave the scattering region long before the peak of the incident wavepacket has arrived .",
    "however , hartman effect and its origin is still considered as a poorly resolved problem .",
    "very recently winful  @xcite argued that ` the tunneling particle or wave packet is not really traveling with superluminal velocity but actually a standing wave , that just stand and waves ! ' .",
    "the incident wave simply modulates this standing wave .",
    "the output adiabatically follows the input with delay proportional to the stored energy .",
    "it is shown that the short time delay observed is due to energy storage and release and has nothing to do with real propagation and hence should not be linked with velocity .",
    "thus the origin of the hartman effect is traced to stored energy . since the stored energy in the evanescent field decreases exponentially within the barrier after a certain decay distance it becomes independent of the width of the barrier .",
    "all the studies on hartman effect till date are restricted to one dimension only .",
    "mostly single  @xcite or successive rectangular barriers  @xcite have been considered .",
    "a very simple semiclassical derivation of hartman effect valid for potential barrier of general shape in one dimension has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our present work",
    "we verify hartman effect beyond one dimension and in the presence of aharonov - bohm flux .",
    "we study the scattering problem across a quantum ring geometry as schematized in fig .",
    "[ system ] .",
    "such ring geometry systems have been extensively investigated in mesoscopic physics in analysing normal state aharanov - bohm effect which has been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "our system of interest constitute a loop connected to two semi - infinite ideal wires in the presence of a magnetic flux as in fig .",
    "[ system ] .",
    "there is a finite quantum mechanical potential @xmath1 inside the loop while that in the connecting leads are set to be zero .",
    "we focus on a situation wherein the incident electrons have an energy @xmath2 less than @xmath1 .",
    "the impinging electrons in this subbarrier regime travels as an evanescent mode throughout the circumference of the loop and the transmission or the conductance involves contributions from both the aharanov - bohm effect as well as quantum tunneling .",
    "we are interested in a single channel case where the fermi energy lies in the lowest subband . to excite the evanescent modes in the ring we have to make the width of the ring much less than that of the connecting wires .",
    "the electrons occupying the lowest subband in the connecting wire on entering the ring experience a higher barrier ( due to higher quantum zero point energy ) and propagate in the loop as evanescent mode .",
    "the transmission or conductance across such systems has been studied in detail  @xcite . in this work",
    "an analysis of the phase delay time or the group delay is carried out .",
    "we approach this scattering problem using the quantum wave guide theory  @xcite .",
    "the wave function in different region in absence of magnetic flux are given below    @xmath3    with @xmath4 being the wavevector of the incident propagating electrons in the leads and @xmath5 the wavevector in the ring .",
    "we have assumed the origin of the co - ordinates of @xmath6 and @xmath7 to be at @xmath8 and that for @xmath9 and @xmath10 to be at @xmath11 . at @xmath8 , @xmath12 and at @xmath11 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the lengths of the upper and lower arms of the ring . total circumference of the ring is @xmath16 .",
    "we use the griffith boundary conditions  @xcite @xmath17 and @xmath18 at the junction @xmath8 .",
    "all the derivatives are either outward or inwards from the junction  @xcite .",
    "similar boundary conditions hold for @xmath11 as well .",
    "we choose a gauge for the vector potential in which the magnetic field appears only in the boundary conditions rather than explicitly in the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "thus the electrons propagating clockwise and anticlockwise will pick up opposite phases .",
    "the electrons propagating in the clockwise direction in the upper arm from @xmath8 will pick up a phase @xmath19 at @xmath11 and electrons propagating anticlockwise from @xmath11 to @xmath8 in the upper arm pick up a phase @xmath20 at @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , an electron picks up a phase @xmath21 at @xmath8 moving in the clockwise direction from @xmath11 in the lower arm and @xmath22 at @xmath11 moving anticlockwise from @xmath8 in the lower arm of the loop .",
    "the total phase around the loop is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the magnetic flux and flux quantum , respectively .",
    "hence from above mentioned boundary conditions we get for propagating waves  @xcite @xmath26 @xmath27",
    "versus @xmath24 for different @xmath28 . the solid , dotted , dashed and dot - dashed curves are for @xmath29 respectively .",

    "solving eqns .",
    "( [ bcwvj1 ] ) -  ( [ bccurrj2 ] ) we obtain an analytical expression for the transmission coefficient @xmath33 as t=[texpr ] where p & = & e^i(+)(e^2l_b - 1 ) , + q&=&(e^2l_u -1 ) , + s_&=&e^i(+)(e^2(l_u+l_b ) 1 ) .",
    "next we evaluate the group delay time which is given by the energy derivative of the phase of the transmission coefficient @xmath34}{\\partial e}.   \\label{phtm}\\ ] ] we have set units of @xmath35 and @xmath36 to be unity .",
    "all the physical quantities are taken in dimensionless units ( @xmath37,@xmath38 and @xmath39 ) . in fig .",
    "( [ tauvsl ] ) we plot phase time @xmath0 as a function of length @xmath28 of the ring for different values of incident energies in the absence of magnetic flux @xmath24 for the case where two armlengths @xmath14 and @xmath15 are equal . from the figure",
    "we clearly see that @xmath0 evolves as a function of length @xmath28 and asymptotically saturates to a value ( @xmath40 ) which is independent of @xmath28 thus confirming the hartman effect .",
    "the saturation value increases with increasing incident energy and the corresponding values for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . in one dimensional single barrier case in the tunneling region",
    "@xmath0 saturates to a constant value as a monotonic function of length . in our present case",
    "we observe depending on energy it is a monotonic or nonmonotonic function as seen from fig .",
    "( [ tauvsl ] ) .",
    "our system differs from the one dimensional case in such a way that electron entering the ring can traverse along different alternative paths before transmitting .",
    "the interference between these alternative paths is responsible for this behaviour in the small @xmath28 regime where contributions from both evanescent and anti - evanescent modes dominate . in fig .",
    "( [ tauvsdiffle ] ) we plot the phase time versus @xmath28 for a particular energy , @xmath46 , in the absence of magnetic flux @xmath24 but for different length ratios of the upper and lower arms .",
    "we observe that the saturation value of the phase time is independent of the arm length ratios for a given energy as one can anticipate . in the inset of fig .",
    "( [ tauvsdiffle ] ) we plot @xmath40 versus @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 with equal upper and lower arm lengths",
    ". plots with different armlength ratios ( @xmath50 ) with different @xmath24 in the asymptotic limit were found to overlap with the above curve in the entire energy regime .",
    "moreover , it is given by an analytical expression , @xmath51 which agrees perfectly well with the numerical results .    in fig .",
    "( [ tauvsphi ] ) we have plotted group delay time as a function of flux @xmath24 for various values of circumference of the ring . in this case @xmath52 and @xmath41 . we observe that @xmath0 is flux periodic with periodicity @xmath25 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that all the physical properties in presence of aharonov - bohm flux across the ring must be periodic function of flux with a period @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "however , we observe that as we increase the length of the ring the visibility or the magnitude of aharonov - bohm oscillations decreases . consequently in the large length limit the visibility of aharonov - bohm oscillations vanishes as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ tauvsphi ] ) .",
    "the constant value of @xmath0 thus obtained in the presence of flux is identical to @xmath40 in the absence of the flux ( see fig .",
    "( [ tauvsl ] ) ) in the large length regime .",
    "this result clearly indicates that the delay time in the presence of opaque barrier becomes not only independent of length of the circumference but also it is independent of the aharonov - bohm flux thereby observing the hartman effect in the presence of aharonov - bohm flux .",
    "we also find that the behaviour of reflection delay time is same as transmission delay time as anticipated from general symmetry laws from the simple geometric structure considered in the present case .",
    "we have verified the hartman effect in a quantum ring geometry in the presence of aharanov - bohm flux .",
    "our studies show that the group delay time for a given incident energy becomes independent of the barrier thickness as well as the magnitude of the flux for the case of opaque barrier .",
    "we have also obtained similar results on different geometric structures by including a potential well between two adjacent barriers . these results which will be reported elsewhere  @xcite were found to agree with the interesting observations made in ref .",
