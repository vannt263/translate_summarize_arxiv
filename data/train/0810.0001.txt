    "charge carriers in the cobaltates , @xmath0 , are located in two dimensional @xmath2 layers separated by insulating layers of @xmath3 ions which act as electron donors .",
    "their structure is a triangular net of edge - sharing oxygen octahedra with the @xmath4 atoms occupying the center and the @xmath5 atoms playing the role of electron donors .",
    "the octahedral symmetry around the @xmath4 ions results in a splitting of the @xmath6-orbitals in two @xmath7 and three lower lying @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "the trigonal distortion of the @xmath2 layers further splits the @xmath8 orbitals into one @xmath9 and two lower @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the valence of the cobaltate ions is @xmath11 which means that the fermi surface will lie in the @xmath9 orbital which will range from half to fully filled .",
    "consequently , the cobaltates constitute a realization of strongly correlated electron physics on a triangular lattice . across their phase diagram",
    "they exhibit a wide range of behavior @xcite ranging from a paramagnetic fermi liquid at low @xmath5 concentration @xmath12 , a strange fermi liquid with curie weiss magnetic susceptibility for high @xmath12 and a singular insulating state at @xmath13 .",
    "while the paramagnetic metal exhibits some properties akin to that of a fermi liquid , the cobaltates still remain strongly correlated systems .",
    "for example , experiment @xcite and theory @xcite place the hopping matrix element and the on - site repulsion at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "various arpes studies have been performed @xcite , which suggest a fermi surface which consists only of a large @xmath9 hole pocket with the @xmath10 orbitals lying under the fermi surface .",
    "this is in contrast with lda calculations @xcite which suggest the existence of peripheral @xmath10 hole pockets . in an effort to resolve this discrepancy , several multi - band dmft studies",
    "have been performed @xcite .",
    "finally a few cdmft calculations @xcite address mostly the mott transition on a triangular lattice or compare different impurity solvers .",
    "motivated by the cobaltates , we address in this paper , the properties of strong electron correlation on a triangular lattice .",
    "of particular interest will be the nature of the mott transition at half - filling on such a lattice .",
    "a triangular lattice offers an ideal playground for exploring the mott transition as a result of the inherent magnetic frustration that is present .",
    "we find that a critical value of @xmath16 separates paramagnetic insulating and metallic phase .",
    "away from half - filling we find a metallic phase with a large fermi surface as is observed experimentally .",
    "this paper is organized in three main sections . in section [ sec : description ]",
    "we give an overview of the computational scheme , the cluster dynamical mean field theory with the non - crossing approximation as the impurity solver in the context of the one - band hubbard model . in section [ sec : limitations ] we discuss the the two main issues related to the consistency of the method : the proper periodization procedure to obtain physically correct lattice quantities and the cluster size dependence of the the results .",
    "we show that , for a given small cluster size , the method breaks down at certain filling values and we argue that the cluster size independence should be the ultimate consistency criterion . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results of the simulation . in [ sub : dispersionless - low - energy ] , we show the existence of a quasi - dispersionless low energy band , which is signature of strong correlations and incompatible with fermi - liquid physics . in [ sub :",
    "mott - transition ] , we discuss the mott transition on the triangular lattice . finally , in [ sub :",
    "pseudogap ] , we argue for the existence of a pseudogap at low hole doping .",
    "we start with the one - band hubbard model,@xmath17 where @xmath18 is the matrix element for hoppings between nearest neighbor sites , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the on - site repulsive interaction .",
    "we assume that the single - band hubbard model on a triangular lattice captures the main features of strongly correlated physics in the presence of magnetic frustration .",
    "we restrict our study to the paramagnetic state@xmath21 which is consistent with the experimental observations in cobaltates for @xmath22 .    as a computational tool ,",
    "we use in our investigation a real - space cluster generalization of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "@xcite the dmft has been a very successful tool in investigating many aspects of strongly correlated systems . in this method",
    "one single site is treated as an impurity embedded in an effective bath consisting of the rest of the sites the properties of which are captured by the hybridization function .",
    "it is exact in infinite dimensions or more precisely in infinite coordination number @xmath23 and it can successfully describe the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "however for many applications it is necessary for the short range ( few lattice site ) correlation to be described accurately . in the cluster dmft method ( cdmft ) , @xcite a cluster extending in a small number of sites is treated as the impurity and therefore the local ( cluster ) degrees of freedom are treated exactly .",
    "the rest of the lattice , the bath , is described by a multi - component hybridization function .",
    "all cluster - dmft - based algorithms contain the following major components .    * an impurity solver , which evaluates the cluster greens function from the hybridization function . * a self consistency condition which expresses the hybridization function with respect to the cluster greens function . * a periodization procedure which connects the lattice quantities with the cluster quantities .",
    "the impurity solver evaluates the cluster green s function , given the `` external '' hybridization function .",
    "various impurity solvers have been proposed in the literature such as exact diagonalization and quantum monte - carlo .",
    "however those can only be implemented in imaginary time and an analytic continuation is required to obtain real time properties .",
    "a real time impurity solver is the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , which is a first order perturbation theory with respect to the hybridization function .",
    "it has the advantage of being very fast and relatively easy to implement .",
    "the nca has been a valuable tool for extracting the physics of the anderson impurity models .",
    "the nca equations can be obtained by using the slave boson method @xcite and they can be expressed with respect to the pseudo - particle resolvents @xmath24 and their self energies @xmath25 where @xmath26 are indices representing the eigenstates of the cluster .",

    "the resolvents can be obtained from the self energy using the dyson equation,@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the diagonal matrix of the clusters eigen - energies and @xmath34 , an artifact of the slave - boson approach , is chosen for convenience .    in the paramagnetic , disordered state , both the spin and the irreducible representation of the geometrical symmetry group",
    "are good quantum numbers and can be used to label the cluster eigenstates,@xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the irreducible representation and it s row , respectively and the rest follow standard notation .",
    "all but the energy @xmath33 are good quantum numbers and they can not be affected by the bath . furthermore all resolvents with the same @xmath38 but different @xmath39 and @xmath37 are the equal to one another .",
    "the self consistency condition generates a new hybridization function , i.e. , a new effective environment for the impurity cluster , starting from a given cluster green function @xmath27 , and taking into account the geometry of the lattice and the non - interacting hoping matrix . within the cdmft scheme ,",
    "the self consistency condition reads    @xmath40    where the matrix @xmath41 is the fourier transform of the inter - cluster hoping matrix @xmath42 , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 being indices that label the clusters inside the superlattice , and @xmath45 is the superlattice momentum .",
    "the cluster cumulant @xmath46 can be expressed in terms of the intra - cluster hoping matrix @xmath47 as@xmath48      once the cluster quantities such as the cumulant or the self energy have been obtained , the corresponding lattice quantities need to be reconstructed @xcite .",
    "a good estimate of these lattice quantities can be obtained by averaging over all the possible ways in which a lattice can be covered with clusters of a given type . for each type of cluster and each lattice",
    "there are a finite number , @xmath49 , of different realizations of the superlattice , which are related to one another by a symmetry operation ( rotation , translation or both ) .",

    "we are going to use two types of clusters : a triangular 3-site cluster and a rhombic 4-site cluster .",
    "because of paramagnetism and also the geometrical symmetry , the triangular cluster has 31 independent resolvents and 2 independent cluster quantities , whereas the rhombic cluster has 309 and 5 respectively . single site and two - site clusters",

    "the key feature that makes a dmft - type treatment applicable is the locality of the correlated physics . in infinite dimensions ,",
    "the correlations are purely local and can be described by a momentum - independent self - energy . in finite dimensions ,",
    "the basic assumption is that the correlations are short ranged and can be captured by a cluster extension of dmft .",
    "the size of the cluster that would properly capture the physics is determined by the range of the relevant correlations and can not be known _ a priori_. therefore , consistency checks are a necessary component of any cluster dmft treatment . in this section , we show that for the two - dimensional hubbard model on a triangular lattice : a ) the self - energy is not a short - range quantity in the mott insulating phase and nearby and therefore should not be extracted from the cluster components .",

    "we argue that a comparison between results obtained using clusters of different sizes is crucial .",
    "the ultimate consistency criterion is the invariance of results to an increase of the cluster .    to solve for the cluster quantities and the resolvents self consistently , we start from an initial guess for the imaginary part of the resolvent self energies and the hybridization function .",
    "the real part was obtained through the krammers - kronig relationships .",
    "one possibility is to start at high temperatures ( @xmath88 ) where the method converges very easily ( a constant @xmath89 and a gaussian @xmath90 is enough ) , and then `` cool down '' progressively using in every step the solution of the previous step .",

    ", we compare the density of states for cumulant and self - energy periodization for both 3 and 4 site clusters . in the vicinity of half - filling , regardless of the cluster size , the self energy periodization results in states lying inside the mott gap , as shown in fig .

    "the relevant quantity is the partial occupancy of a particular cluster state@xmath99 small occupancy signifies that the corresponding resolvent contributes insignificantly to the cluster spectral function and consequently to the hybridization function .",
    "therefore , the resolvents with small occupancy can be ignored , whereas the ones with large overlap have the dominant contribution to the dynamics of the system . for the triangular cluster",

    "in all cases , we observe that when the dominant resolvents have fillings @xmath102 close to the lattice filling , their partial occupancy peaks and transitions from and to them become rare , which gives rise to an insulating state . in the triangular lattice",
    "this has a consequence when @xmath103 , because in this case there is only one dominant resolvent . as a result",

    "[ fig : mott - transition ] displays clearly that for @xmath129 , with @xmath116 and @xmath130 for the triangle and rhombic cluster respectively , the system is an insulator , whereas for @xmath131 a drude peak emerges at the chemical potential .",
    "note that the density of states near the chemical potential remains unchanged ( relative to its value for @xmath132 ) although the density of states at the chemical potential develops a non - zero value as a transition is made to a metallic state .",
    "consequently , the states that fill in the mott gap and give rise to the coherence peak arise from spectral weight transfer from high energy , the essence of mottness .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_accrossmotttransition ] which compares the spectral function right before and after the transition .",
    "such a redistribution of spectral weight far from the chemical potential near the mott transition has been recently observed in the manganites @xcite .    the operative mechanism for the mott transition in the three and four - site cluster analysis stands in contrast to the scenario predicted by dmft @xcite . in this scenario a coherent peak of constant height exists at the chemical potential , which successively narrows as @xmath20 increases to @xmath133 . for @xmath132 ,",
    "the peak vanishes and the upper and lower hubbard bands become well separated .",
    "cdmft in the plaquette offers a different scenario @xcite : first a pseudogap opens at the chemical potential which smoothly grows to form a full mott gap at the critical @xmath20 . in the triangle , there is no formation of a pseudogap .",
    "instead the coherence peak at the chemical potential loses weight @xmath134 as @xmath20 increases and is smoothly replaced by a gap which broadens as the two bands separate .       using the triangular cluster .",
    "the pseudogap feature is dispersed as the temperature increases.[fig : dos_hf_temp ] ]    in light of the physics in the cuprates , one of the main questions that needs to be addressed is whether or not a mott system on a triangular lattice exhibits a pseudogap .",
    "we focus here on the single - particle density of states as a function of filling . in the triangular lattice",
    ", there is only indirect evidence from a boson analysis of the optical conductivity for a pseudogap in the paramagnetic phase ( @xmath135 ) @xcite , @xcite which disappears in the strange metal phase ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "our results for the single - particle density of states on either side of half - filling are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : rhombdosevohf ] and [ fig : dos_triangle_hf ] .",
    "although a dip - like features exists for both the 3 and 4-site clusters , it is displaced from the chemical potential . for higher dopings ,",
    "the density of states is smooth in the vicinity of the chemical potential .",
    "consequently , we find an absence of a pseudogap near half - filling on a triangular lattice .",
    "this result is consistent with the quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite as the impurity solver coupled with cdmft on the triangular lattice .",
    "we traced the origin of the dip - like feature to an energy splitting of two resolvents in the triangular lattice ( three in the rhombic ) with total spin differing by 1 .",
    "the relevant energy scale is @xmath137 . to probe this feature further , we calculated its evolution as the temperature is lowered . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_hf_temp ] , as the temperature is lowered , the dip - like feature remains below the chemical potential and more importantly the peak at the chemical potential sharpens , as would be expected for a metallic state .",
    "consequently , using the dip - like feature in the density of states as the criterion for the existence of a pseudogap , we conclude that no pseudogap exists for the hubbard model on a triangular lattice for either electron or hole doping .",
    "however , this analysis is incomplete .",
    "let us approach the pseudogap problem from a different perspective . in the undoped cuprates , the quasiparticle dispersion below the mott gap is characterized by four maxima at the @xmath138 points in the brillouin zone , as revealed by arpes measurements on @xmath139@xcite .",
    "this feature is also present in the half - filled hubbard model on a square lattice@xcite . for a weakly ( hole )",
    "doped system , if one adopts the naive picture of a rigid band shift , one would expect the chemical potential to move to the top of the lower hubbard band and intersect it somewhere in the vicinity of the four minima .",
    "the resulting fermi surface would consist of four small hole pockets in the vicinity of the @xmath138 points , while the rest of the large fermi surface observed in optimally doped and overdoped cuprates ( or at large doping values in the calculations for the hubbard model ) would be completely obliterated . that is , the low - energy excitations are gaped everywhere in the brillouin zone , except on the boundary of the small fermi pockets .",
    "this picture seems to be consistent with arpes measurements on underdoped cuprates @xcite , as well as the infrared hall effect @xcite and quantum oscillation measurements @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , strong coupling calculations show that the naive rigid band picture is , in fact , incorrect and that strong correlations play a crucial role in pseudogap physics .",
    "one of the essential aspects of strong correlations is spectral weight transfer . to illustrate its role ,",
    "let us approach the pseudogap problem for hubbard model on a triangular lattice starting from the mott insulating phase .",
    "note that , in contrast to the square lattice model , in this case particle - hole symmetry is always absent and the antiferromagnetic interactions are frustrated . in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3dplot_uhb_lhb ] ) we show the top of the lower hubbard band ( left panel ) and the bottom of the upper hubbard band ( right panel ) for a half - filled system with @xmath93 .",
    "the two bands are separated by a mott gap of about @xmath140 , and the chemical potential sits in the middle of the gap .",
    "the two surfaces are defined by the smallest frequencies at which the spectral function exceeds a certain small threshold @xmath141 .",
    "variations of @xmath141 produce only small shifts of the two surfaces , but their shapes remain essentially the same .",
    "first , let us focus on the upper hubbard band . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3dplot_uhb_lhb ] ) , it is characterized by a set of minima along a large closed curve around the @xmath142 point , not far from the fermi surface corresponding to that of the non - interacting half - filled system .",
    "a small electron doping would move the chemical potential near this set of minima of the upper hubbard band .",
    "in the rigid band picture , one ends up with two almost circular fermi surfaces that define a narrow electron ring .",
    "however , our strong - coupling calculation leads to a different picture . shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : pseudogapdisc_sf_electron_doping ] ) is the spectral function along the @xmath121 path in the brillouin zone and a small frequency window about the chemical potential for two small doping values . for comparison",
    ", we also show the bottom of the upper hubbard band for the insulator ( upper panel ) within a similar frequency window .",
    "note that for the insulator the bottom of the band corresponds to some middle points between @xmath142 and @xmath143 and between @xmath87 and @xmath142 . in the vicinity of the @xmath142 point",
    ", there is no spectral weight within our frequency window [ see also fig .",
    "( [ fig:3dplot_uhb_lhb ] ) ] .",
    "however , once we dope the system , some spectral weight is transferred from high energies to low energies , so that a low energy band clearly forms in the vicinity of @xmath142 just below the chemical potential . as a result ,",
    "the strongly correlated narrow band that controls the low - energy physics disperses across the chemical potential generating a large fermi surface consistent with the luttinger theorem .",
    "a crucial difference from the square - lattice case is that the anisotropy along this large fermi surface ( or along the line defining the minima of the upper hubbard band for the insulator ) is very weak .",
    "by contrast , for the square lattice there is a qualitative difference between the @xmath144 and the @xmath145 regions of the brillouin zone as illustrated , for example , by the existence of minima near the nodal points .",
    "this lack of anisotropy leads to the sudden appearance of a large fermi surface upon doping and thus to the absence of a pseudogap .",
    "the situation appears somehow different in the case of the lower hubbard band . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3dplot_uhb_lhb ] ) , the top of the lower hubbard band is extremely flat and extends over a significant portion of momentum space , all around the boundary of the brillouin zone .",
    "very weak maxima can be identified near the k points . in this case",
    ", the rigid band picture would suggest that a weakly hole - doped system is characterized by low - energy excitations that extend over a large portion of the brillouin zone and that small fermi pockets would possibly form near the k points and extend rapidly with doping .",
    "again , in the vicinity of @xmath142 there is no spectral weight at low energy .",
    "however , in contrast to the upper hubbard band , this lack of low - energy excitations at small momenta persists upon doping . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudogapdisc_sf_hole_doping ] is the low - energy spectral function along the same @xmath121 path for the insulator ( upper panel ) and two values of doping .",
    "the relevant spectral weight transfer contributes this time to the re - shaping of the low - energy narrow band that exists at momenta far from the @xmath142 points . at",
    "increased doping values , this band becomes more dispersive and generates a large fermi surface consistent with the non - interacting fermi surface of a system with the same filling factor .",
    "nonetheless , at very small doping values , several questions remain .",
    "first , it seems that the chemical potential crosses the narrow band in an extended area of the brillouin zone , rather than along a well - defined fermi line .",
    "this stands in sharp contradiction with fermi liquid theory .",
    "however , one has to take into account that our results are obtained at a finite temperature of order @xmath146 , and thus the energy resolution is severely limited . to establish exactly the position of the fermi surface at low dopings would require a much better energy resolution , and consequently a much lower temperature , would be necessary .",
    "the second question concerns the existence of a pseudogap .",
    "one typically understands the pseudogap as a reduction in the number of low - energy modes below a certain energy scale .",
    "here we propose a slightly different view .",
    "we define the pseudogap phase as a physical state occurring close to a mott insulating state and characterized by the existence of small fermi pockets with an area proportional to the doping level @xmath147 .",
    "by contrast , a normal fermi liquid is characterized by a large fermi surface with an area that is related , via the luttinger theorem , to the filling n. consequently , one should view a system in the pseudogap phase as a doped mott insulator . at the same time",
    ", the system represents a re - normalized fermi liquid characterized by a reconstructed fermi surface . from this perspective , the weakly hole - doped hubbard model on a triangular lattice is in the pseudogap state . within the energy and momentum resolution of the present method",
    ", the fermi surface appears as a set of small pockets around the k points that expand rapidly upon doping .",
    "a normal fermi liquid is established at a doping level of a few percent .",
    "we emphasize that a crucial condition for the realization of this pseudogap phase was the existence of the small anisotropy in the lowest energy excitations of the mott insulator . to study in detail the formation and the evolution of the hole pockets , calculations using larger clusters ( i.e. , having a better momentum resolution ) and lower temperatures are necessary .     and @xmath94 .",

    "numerical results are obtained for two types of clusters containing three and four sites , respectively .",
    "we stress that the cluster size analysis is a required step in any cluster dmft - type calculation and argue that the relative invariance of the result against increasing the cluster size is the ultimate consistency criterion .",

    "larger cluster calculations are required to clarify this point . nonetheless , the task is of pivotal importance because , if in a certain regime , both the self - energy and the cumulant are long - ranged quantities , the presently available real- and momentum - space cluster dmft schemes are not applicable .    at low doping values , we find that the hubbard model on a triangular lattice is strongly correlated with low - energy physics controlled by a quasi - dispersionless band . as a result of correlations ,",
    "the band is very narrow , and its spectral weight can be transferred over large energy scales .",
    "a band with such features can not be described by any weakly coupled approach .",
    "we also find that a metal - insulator transition occurs at a critical value of the on - site interaction @xmath148 , which depends very weakly on the size of the cluster .",
    "this value is much lower than the critical interaction determined of @xmath149 in cdmft calculations using exact diagonalization as the impurity solver @xcite , but it is closer to @xmath150 , which is the critical interaction obtained by continuous - time monte carlo @xcite . finally , we discussed the pseudogap problem in the context of the hubbard model on a triangular lattice .",
    "in contrast to the square - lattice case , we find no evidence for a dip in the density of states positioned at the chemical potential .",
    "however , a momentum - resolved analysis shows that the locus of the low - energy excitations of the weakly hole - doped system is qualitatively different from that of a non - interacting system .",
    "therefore , we propose a new framework for discussing the pseudogap phenomenon , which in essence involves a momentum - dependent characterization of the low - energy physics , rather than a momentum - integrated one . we define a pseudogap state as a state characterized by low - energy excitations occurring only in a relatively small region in momentum space , qualitatively different from the location of the low - energy quasiparticles of the non - interacting system , and having an area that shrinks to zero when approaching the mott insulator .",
    "consequently , the system in the pseudogap state is characterized by a re - constructed fermi surface consisting of small pockets .",
    "we find that the conditions necessary for the appearance of these pockets is a strongly momentum - dependent self - energy which produces quasiparticles with anisotropic properties along the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , the pseudogap is intrinsically linked to mott physics as emphasized recently , which is the source of the long - range self - energy . within the resolution of the present calculation",
