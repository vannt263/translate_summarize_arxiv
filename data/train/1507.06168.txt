    "the effect of additional parameters may be treated by study of their small perturbations .",
    "the main goal of this theory is to classify _ qualitative _ types of equation and its arbitrary small perturbations . in order to achieve this goal",
    ", we first define a _ qualitative property _ as a property that is invariant under an appropriate equivalence relation . here",
    ", we use _ contact - equivalence _ relation :    * we say that the germs @xmath11 and @xmath12 are contact - equivalent when there exist a smooth germ @xmath13 and diffeomorphic germs @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that [ conteqvl ] g(x,)= s(x,)h(x(x , ) , ( ) ) , where @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18    other alternative equivalences have also been reported in the literature based on their applications ; e.g. , see @xcite where _ right - left _ and _ strategy equivalences _ have been used .",
    "_ right equivalence _ is also used to study the isolated hypersurface of geometric singularities and to study the bifurcation analysis in _ catastrophe theory _ ; see @xcite .",
    "the contact - equivalence is here used , since it is the most natural equivalence relation preserving the zero structures .",
    "now we briefly describe the approach in singularity theory and how the computational algebraic tools may help to implement them . to study the local zeros of , we choose a representative ( say @xmath5 ) from contact - equivalent class of @xmath11 that is considered to be the _",
    "simplest _ for the analysis and call it a _ normal from_. in order to compute the normal form of a singular germ , we need to compute certain ideals in the _ local ring of smooth germs_. this signifies the importance of the well - known ideal membership problem in algebraic geometry , that is , deciding what kinds of germs belong to an ideal generated by a given set .",
    "one may study the zero structures of the normal forms and then , conclude about the solution behavior of equation .",
    "for instance , let [ exmp1 ] g(x , ) : = ( x^2)+2(x)-3+().using the command @xmath19 in singularity , we obtain its normal form by @xmath20 the bifurcation diagrams of @xmath5 and @xmath11 are depicted in figure [ a ] and [ b ] . here , @xmath21 provides an approximation @xmath22 modulo degree 5 for @xmath23 which transforms @xmath11 into @xmath5 via equation . the locally invertible transformation @xmath24 sends the bifurcation diagram of @xmath5 into that of @xmath11 .",
    "real life problems can not be perfectly modeled by a system of equations and _ imperfections _ are always inevitable .",
    "furthermore , the singularity of a germ @xmath11 implies that the zeros of a small perturbation of @xmath25 say [ unfold ] h(x , , ) = 0 , h(x , , 0)=g ( x , ) , may behave substantially different than what the zero structure associated with @xmath26 does .",
    "the parameterized germ @xmath12 in is called an _ unfolding _ of @xmath27 hence , _ modeling imperfections _ and the possible existence of additional parameters in a model are the main obstacles of simply using normal forms of a singular germ for the qualitative understanding of a real life problem .",
    "thus , the approach needs to be refined through the notion of _ universal unfolding_. in fact , we are interested to find a parameterized family like [ eq4 ] g(x , , ) = 0 , ^p , such that for any small perturbation @xmath28 , the germ @xmath29 would be contact - equivalent to @xmath30 for some germ @xmath31 we call such germ @xmath32 a _ versal unfolding _ of @xmath27 a versal unfolding with the minimum possible number of parameters is called a _ universal unfolding _ for @xmath11 ; see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the number of parameters in a universal unfolding is named the _ codimension _ of @xmath27 the universal unfolding accommodates any possible modeling imperfections , any arbitrary small perturbation and also the existence of any possible number of parameters ( in addition to the distinguished parameter @xmath33 in order to derive the universal unfolding of a given singularity , the computation of a vector space called _ tangent space _ or instead a basis for its complement is required .",
    "using singularity s command @xmath34 for @xmath11 in gives rise to [ univexmp ] g(x , , _ 1 , _",
    "2):= x^4++_1x+_2x^2 .",
    "_ bifurcation diagram classification _ of the universal unfolding gives an insight to the zero structure of a germ and any of its perturbations .",
    "this is studied by the notion of _ persistence _ in the bifurcation diagrams .",

    "@xmath35 ) play a central role in this classification .",
    "more precisely , all parametric germs associated with parameters in a connected component of @xmath36 complement of @xmath37 are contact - equivalent .",
    "therefore by choosing a parameter from each connected component of @xmath36 a complete list of persistent bifurcation diagrams modulo contact - equivalent is obtained .",
    "the non - persistence may either originate from a local nature or be caused by the singular boundary conditions .",

    "given our description in the previous section , we mainly need to address the _ ideal membership problem _ in the ring of smooth germs .",
    "we call an _ ideal basis _ for the ( finite ) _ generators _ of a finitely generated ideal .",
    "the _ ideal membership problem _ refers to the question on whether or not an element belongs to a predefined ideal .",
    "although a _ finitely generated ideal _ is defined by a ideal basis , yet it is not an easy task to understand whether a given element belongs to the ideal or not .",
    "there are two different ways to facilitate the ideal membership problem .",
    "one is to find a convenient ideal presentation from which the ideal membership can be easily understood .",
    "this is feasible for certain ideals and will be addressed in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the second is a computational approach based on a division algorithm . dividing a given element by the ideal basis ( generators )",
    ", the element certainly belongs to the ideal when the remainder is zero .",
    "however for non - zero remainders with respect to an arbitrary ideal basis , the division may not help to conclude about the membership of the element in the ideal .",
    "b. buchberger in 1965 introduced an ideal basis ( called _ basis _ ) for ideals in the polynomial ring on which zero / nonzero remainders would indeed conclude the ideal membership ; see @xcite .",
    "armbruster and kredel @xcite suggested a cognitive use of basis for computing universal unfolding ; also see @xcite .",
    "then , gatermann and lauterbach @xcite extended the tools for equivariant bifurcation problems .",
    "wright and cowel in @xcite noticed that a local version of basis is indeed the appropriate tool to work with it in this theory .",
    "in fact , naive uses of basis yield wrong results for many singularities ( e.g. , see remark [ m15 ] ) .",
    "the main reason is that basis may work with polynomial germs , while the ring of smooth germs is a considerably larger ring than the polynomial germs .",
    "recall that a set may generate a larger ideal in a ring than what it generates in a subring .",
    "since wright and cowel s remark , the only result in this direction is due to gatermann and hosten @xcite which is a fundamental contribution .",
    "they used ( mixed ) _ standard basis _ for `` _ _ mixed modules _ _ '' over fractional maps and multi - dimensional state variables .",
    "they did not discuss computations with smooth maps and taylor series truncations .",
    "therefore , their suggested algorithms are limited to treat certain ( finite codimension ) fractional maps .",
    "their algorithms are useful for possible implementations in a computer algebra system to simplify fractional maps with finite codimension .",
    "however , they are not sufficient to compute _ normal forms_. the reason is that they attempted neither to simplify _ removable intermediate order terms _ nor to address the issue facing high order terms for multi - dimensional cases ( there does not yet exist a complete algebraic characterizations for high order terms ) ; for example see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 53 ) .",
    "the principal ideas of basis have been extended for localizations of the polynomial ring and formal power series . here ,",
    "we are concerned with local rings and the terminology _ `` standard basis '' _ ( not basis ) is usually used in the context of local rings . following wright and cowel s remark , gatermann and hosten @xcite used the localizations of the polynomial ring ( a local ring ) to circumvent the problem .",
    "the localization of the polynomial - germ ring gives rise to the fractional germs , i.e. , germs with a fractional representative in their germ - equivalent class .",
    "although the set of all fractional germs is a local ring , yet it is still a much smaller ring than the ring of smooth germs .",
    "the other alternative is the local germ ring of all formal power series .",
    "this is a larger ring than the fractional germs and it is , perhaps , suitable due to borel lemma .",
    "( borel lemma indicates the existence of a one - to - one correspondence modulo flat functions between smooth germs and formal power series through their taylor series expansion . )",
    "one of the main obstacles in working with the local rings is termination of the algorithms .",
    "there are methods in the literature for computing the _ standard basis _ ( for fractional maps using mora normal form ) so that they solve the problem of algorithm terminations .",
    "yet for the case of formal power series , no computer program can compute and store infinite formal power series expansions and thus , their truncations up to certain degrees are mostly unavoidable . in other words ,",
    "the computations are performed modulo a sufficiently high degree ( we will justify this in theorem [ thm2.18 ] ( part 4 ) ) . in this section",
    "we investigate and compare the computations in the local ( germ ) rings of polynomials , the fractional germs and formal power series with those in the ring of smooth germs .",
    "we discuss the circumstances on which they can be alternatively used .",
    "this helps to efficiently use the different algorithms and yet ensure about correctness of the results .",
    "let @xmath46 be a field of characteristic zero ; in particular we are interested in the field of real numbers . for our convenience , we simply identify a given germ with a convenient representative of that germ .",
    "for instance , we talk about the polynomial germ ring over the field @xmath46 and denote it by @xmath47 $ ] while we mean the ring of all smooth germs whose germ - equivalent class have a polynomial representative .",
    "the quotient ring of @xmath9 over the ideal of all flat germs is denoted by @xmath48 $ ] due to the fact that it is ring - isomorphic to the ring of formal power series .",

    "<S> this latter capability is in fact enabled by using a powerful built - in maple 18 package called regularchains @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to develop ` singularity ` , we have discussed some modified concepts ( suitable in our context ) from computational algebraic geometry including _ division remainders , _ _ standard bases , _ _ elimination ideals , _ _ ideal membership problem _ and _ colon ideals _ for the local rings of fractional ( germ ) maps , formal power series and smooth maps . </S>",
