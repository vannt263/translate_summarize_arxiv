    "when a target is so faint that our best image consists of a few bright pixels on an infrared array , there seems little hope of probing the structure hidden within .",
    "yet even the faintest light , limited by diffraction or seeing , carries with it a hidden property : polarization .",
    "this is the tool which has been investigated and used in this work , to reveal new data on nine radio galaxies .",
    "humanity s understanding of the universe has developed radically since immanuel kant first speculated about the existence of ` island universes ' in the eighteenth century . in 1845 ,",
    "lord rosse completed construction of his great reflecting telescope , and subsequently discovered spiral structure in many of messier s nebulae . by 1920",
    ", it was seriously argued that the spiral nebulae were in fact galaxies external to our own - epitomised by the ` great debate ' of astronomy between curtis and shapley that year @xcite .",
    "hubble s determination of the distance to the spiral nebulae resolved the debate , and in the years that followed , the vast majority of galaxies were found to be of elliptical or spiral formation .",
    "the advent of radio astronomy opened up a second waveband through which the universe could be studied , and by the late 1960s , radio astrometry was sufficiently accurate that radio sources could be identified with their optical counterparts .",
    "it became apparent that many elliptical galaxies were strong radio sources  forming the class of _ radio galaxies _",
    "most of the sources consisted of double radio lobes spanning a distance 5 - 10 times the size of the parent galaxy at the centre .",
    "at the same time , numerous other classes of unusual galaxies or intense radio sources were revealing themselves to new instruments .",
    "earliest to become apparent was the class of seyferts , galaxies ( normally spirals ) with unusually bright nuclei whose spectra included narrow ( @xmath15 km / s ) permitted and forbidden emission lines .",
    "some seyferts also exhibited broader ( @xmath16 km / s ) permitted emission lines , and were branded ` type 1 ' , while those without were spectroscopic ` type 2 ' .",
    "seyferts exhibit radio emission , but this is usually weak .",
    "the lines were accompanied by a ` featureless continuum ' whose profile was flat rather than the curve characteristic of blackbody thermal emission ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "meanwhile , radio surveys had also identified sources whose optical counterparts were found to be brilliant and pointlike : these were named quasars , the quasi - stellar radio sources .",
    "like type 1 seyferts , quasars exhibited a flat spectrum optical continuum with strong emission lines , both narrow and broad . in 1963 ,",
    "quasar emission lines were first identified with an element : 3c 273 s emission lines were found to be characteristic of hydrogen at high redshift , @xmath17 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the radio - loud quasars were found to be excessively luminous in the @xmath18-band compared with stars and normal galaxies , which prompted optical surveys to hunt for more objects with ultraviolet excesses .",
    "these surveys discovered many more quasi - stellar objects with similar spectra , and 90 - 95% of all quasars are now thought to be radio - quiet .",
    "collectively , seyferts , quasars and radio galaxies became known as ` active galaxies ' , the _ collins dictionary of astronomy _ definition @xcite",
    "being ` galaxies that are emitting unusually large amounts of energy from a very compact central source  hence the alternative name of _ active galactic nuclei _ or _ agn _ ' .",
    "classification of an object as an agn may be made because the active nucleus has been observed directly , or be inferred from the presence of radio lobes .",
    "certain extremely energetic agn clearly dominated by an optically bright nucleus became known as ` blazars ' @xcite .",
    "at first it was unclear whether the wide - ranging class of ` agn ' was simply phenomenological , or whether the different types of agn were linked by an underlying physical mechanism .",
    "all species of agn demanded a mechanism whereby a much greater energy output might be obtained from the heart of a galaxy than could be accounted for by stellar nuclear fusion ; the mechanism would have to be capable of giving rise to a flat spectrum in both radio and optical wavelengths , provide for the presence of hot clouds of gas emitting radiation at particular wavelengths , and allow for the presence or absence of radio jets .",
    "now it is generally accepted that the underlying mechanism in all these objects is the accretion of matter on to a black hole @xcite . infalling matter forms an accretion disk , heated by viscous and/or turbulent processes , which glows in the ultraviolet and possibly soft x - rays .",
    "hard x - rays are emitted in the innermost part of the disk .",
    "clouds of gas close to the black hole move rapidly in its gravitational potential , and produce line emission at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths  these form and occupy the broad line region ( blr ) . well beyond the accretion disk , gas and dust forms a second , warped , disk or torus .",
    "this torus screens the blr from view in those agn whose line of sight to the earth is not close to the axis of the torus .",
    "energetic particles escape in well - collimated jets at the poles of the torus .",
    "gas clouds further from the active nucleus travel at lower velocities : not obscured by the torus , such clouds emit light whose emission lines suffer less doppler broadening . hence narrow",
    "lines are seen in all forms of agn , whereas in those agn oriented so our line of sight is ` down the jet ' we see the otherwise obscured broad line regions and/or continuum light from the central engine .",
    "this model mechanism , illustrated in figure [ unifig ] , is generally known as the _ unification model _ of agn . at present",
    ", this stands as the ` best buy ' model for agn , but is not universally accepted  especially in the case of quasars .",
    "the diagram below shows the postulated structure of an active nucleus according to the unification hypothesis .",
    "the molecular torus is cut away at the front to show the broad line region clouds and core .",
    "the black hole at the centre is surrounded by an accretion disc .",
    "this figure is reproduced from urry & padovani ,   pasp , reprinted with permission of the authors .",
    "drawing on the spectroscopic classification of seyferts , agn generally are now classified ` type 1 ' and ` type 2 ' . type 2 objects are those with no evidence of a direct view of their central engines : radio galaxies exhibiting only narrow emission lines ( nlrgs ) join seyfert 2s in this category .",
    "type 1 objects are those which do seem to include radiation from the central engine , and seyfert 1s are joined by blrgs ( broad - lined radio galaxies  which also show the narrow lines ) , and by quasars .",
    "one important prediction of the unification model is that type 2 objects , with their torus axis being aligned roughly in the plane of the sky , ought to include broad line regions ( blrs ) whose light , though obscured from earth , escapes into the plane of the sky .",
    "dust particles or electrons in the host galaxy or in the clouds responsible for the narrow lines should scatter some of this light into our line of sight . when light becomes scattered , it becomes linearly polarized in the sense perpendicular to the pre- and post - scattering flight axes of the photon ; hence linearly polarised imaging or spectroscopy of agn should reveal light from blrs polarised perpendicular to the direction of the radio jet ( presumed to be aligned with the opening of the torus ) .",
    "the motivation of this thesis is to search for evidence of such polarization in @xmath0-band infrared light from radio galaxies  a waveband thought , but not proven , to be dominated by light from the host galaxy s stars rather than the active nucleus .",
    "findings of @xmath0-band polarization would set important constraints on the relative strengths of the nuclear and stellar components .",
    "accordingly , the next chapter presents a review of the _ status quo _ in our knowledge of the relationship between radio galaxies radio structure and their morphological and polarization properties .",
    "first , however , we must look at the ` big picture ' of the different classes of agn known to exist , and how they might be related to one another if the best - buy unification hypothesis is correct .",
    "contemporary authors embrace the unification model as the accepted model for agn with various degrees of enthusiasm : antonucci rushes to set it up as the ` straw person model ' against which he reviews the current observational evidence ; for robson it is a solid foundation , while peterson s approach is more cautious .",
    "there is no other serious contender to explain the wide range of agn phenomena , although in certain individual objects @xcite starbursts rather than black hole accretion may form the hidden engine driving the radiation output .",
    "a fundamental division between the various classes of agn is their radio strength .",
    "radio galaxies , by definition , are radio loud .",
    "seyferts are empirically found to be radio quiet .",
    "all blazars , without known exception , are radio loud ; 9095% of quasars are radio quiet .",
    "the various classifications of agn stem historically from the ( often extreme ) prototypes of each class first discovered , and are not always helpful in classifying less extreme examples : for instance , a radio - loud galaxy with an obvious active nucleus would now be classified a radio galaxy rather than a seyfert , so the absence of radio - loud seyferts is a consequence of taxonomy rather than physics . while some attempt has been made to define the different agn classes more rigorously (",
    "* ch.2 ) , the older literature and human nature militate against the use of clear - cut terms to distinguish different classes of object  objects which are hypothesised to lie on a continuum of classes in any case !      as summarised earlier , the first key to unification came from studies of seyfert galaxy spectra .",
    "seyferts are now defined as low luminosity agn with absolute magnitudes @xmath19 @xcite ; it follows naturally , therefore , that all known seyferts are at low redshift and their morphology is open for study .",
    "nearly all seyfert agn are found to lie within spiral galaxies @xcite , often of type sa or sb , and the host galaxies are more likely than normal spirals to be barred and/or deformed .",
    "robson notes that in the rare cases where seyferts are radio - loud , they often have other peculiar characteristics .",
    "spectral studies of seyferts led to the type 1 / type 2 classification based on the presence or absence of broad spectral lines .",
    "the discovery of broad lines in type 2 seyfert ngc 1068 in polarised light @xcite prompted the realization that the broad line emitting region ( blr ) must lie within some geometrical feature which screened it from direct view .",
    "this screening feature  the postulated molecular torus  is typically of diameter @xmath20 100 pc , and should not be confused with the accretion disk in the central engine , measuring perhaps 0.03 pc .",
    "a typical schematic diagram is figure 7.1 of peterson ; an excellent cartoon sketching the structure of an agn at eight different scales ( @xmath21@xmath22 pc ) is borrowed from blandford by robson .",
    "recent studies of the near - infrared ( @xmath2-band ) polarization of ngc 1068 @xcite have been found to be consistent with a scattered light hypothesis and have even allowed the likely position and orientation of the molecular torus to be identified : the torus in this case has a diameter greater than 200 pc .",
    "miller & goodrich studied eight further seyfert 2s to see if spectropolarimetry would reveal seyfert 1 features , choosing objects already known to have high broadband polarizations .",
    "four gave definite positive results , two gave definite negatives , and two failed to produce reliable signal - to - noise .",
    "the four polarised galaxies revealed polarized features consistent with seyfert 1 properties , albeit with a degree of ` bluing ' in the spectrum indicative that dust scattering must be a contributing mechanism .",
    "three of these , and possibly one of the two low signal - to - noise sources , exhibited perpendicular alignment between the polarization orientation and the radio axis .",
    "similar perpendicular alignments had also been detected in seyfert 2s by antonucci .",
    "parallel _ polarizations have been observed in a few seyfert 1s ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    the _ nuclear _ polarization levels obtained by miller & goodrich were only of the order of a few percent  rather low if the underlying mechanism is the scattering implied by the perpendicular alignment .",
    "antonucci speculates that they may have underestimated the contribution of host galaxy starlight , and that the true polarization may be closer to the 16% level observed in ngc 1068 .",
    "further tests for the unification model in seyferts are reviewed by antonucci  some may indicate refinements that need to take account of additional parameters in the model ( e.g.  the opening angle of the molecular torus ) but none fatally wound the principle of unification .",
    "claims that some seyfert 2s contain no blr emission @xcite call for more sensitive spectropolarimetry before they can seriously question unification : robson and peterson note that this is a hot area of current research .",
    "until proven otherwise , it can be safely stated that seyfert galaxies fall into two distinct classes : broad line ( type 1 ) objects which sometimes exhibit weak polarizations parallel to the radio structure , and narrow line ( type 2 ) objects which often display strong perpendicular polarizations .",
    "the precise definition of a blazar seems to depend on which source is consulted .",
    "i will follow robson s helpful advice that the term refers to a phenomenon rather than a simple class of object : specifically , the phenomenon of a relativistic jet beamed roughly in the direction of terrestrial observers , dominating the radio thru infrared spectrum with its non - thermal synchrotron emission .",
    "the blazar phenomenon is exhibited by three classes of object : bl lacertae objects ( blls ) , optically violent variable sources ( ovvs ) , and highly polarized quasars ( hpqs ) .",
    "blls are distinguished and defined by the lack of emission or absorption features in their spectra .",
    "they often exhibit variability ( changing their output by several magnitudes in the space of a few weeks ) and usually lie in elliptical galaxies , though spiral hosts are also known .",
    "ovvs are agn ( with spectra including broad emission lines ) which exhibit short timescale luminosity variations ( @xmath23 mag ) over timespans as short as a day @xcite . no radio - quiet ovvs or blls",
    "are known @xcite .",
    "antonucci argues strongly that the distinction between blls and ovvs is ill - founded  especially given that the sources very variability can switch them between the two categories  and that in fact all radio - loud agn with radio structures dominated by emission from the core are part of the same family of objects .",
    "the optical components of core - dominated radio - loud agn tend to be quite red , highly variable , and polarized : this is proposed to be the high - frequency tail of the core synchrotron emission .",
    "only emission from the core can vary coherently over timescales of weeks or days .",
    "he proposes that blls are simply the extreme cases where the synchrotron emission utterly dominates other components of the optical output , and predicts that more sensitive spectropolarimetry of bl lacertae objects would reveal faint unpolarised broad emission lines from the blr clouds basking in the synchrotron jets .",
    "conversely , he also suggests that those core - dominated radio - loud agn not classed as blazars would reveal a faint red optical core under careful scrutiny .",
    "robson also includes hpqs in his phenomenological class of blazars .",
    "scarpa & falomo recently compared the optical properties of a sample of hpqs and blls , finding that optical properties of radio - selected bl lacertae objects were very similar to those of highly polarised quasars .",
    "an earlier survey comparing high- and low - polarization quasars @xcite found that all but two of their hpqs were radio - loud , and the two radio - quiet quasars had their own peculiarities .",
    "the orientation angles of the hpq linear polarizations seemed randomly distributed with respect to the radio axes ; this bears out the core emission hypothesis , as the synchrotron mechanism produces light whose polarisation orientation has no relationship with the radio jet geometry .",
    "it seems eminently reasonable to accommodate hpqs between less extreme core - dominated radio - loud agn and the ovvs on antonucci s unified blazar scheme .      complementing the definition of seyferts , above , quasars are now defined as agn with absolute magnitudes @xmath24 @xcite . a small proportion ( 5 - 10% )",
    "are known to be radio - loud ; spectroscopically , quasars exhibit spectra similar to type 1 seyferts @xcite .",
    "since moore & stockman found hpqs to be quite distinct from low polarization quasars ( lpqs ) we have already dealt with hpqs as blazars ; and stockman , moore & angel undertook a specific study of the lpqs .",
    "the cut - off can not be precisely defined , but 3% polarization is normally taken as an effective working threshold in the literature .",
    "stockman , moore & angel found that the typical lpq polarization was around 0.6% and tended to be aligned _ parallel _ with the radio axis .",
    "there was no strong evidence for temporal variability in the degree or orientation of polarization , with upper limits of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in a sub - sample of lpqs mostly selected in the radio ,",
    "the @xmath14-band polarization was typically 50% greater than the @xmath12-band value ; the equivalent test was not performed on optically - selected lpqs .",
    "the lack of variability and the tendency for polarization to increase at shorter wavelengths rules out a blazar origin for the polarized light in lpqs : models invoking scattering off dust grains or electrons in a disk or oblate cloud could account for such polarization but the mechanism is still very unclear .",
    "stockman , angel & miley , antonucci and moore & stockman provide evidence for a bimodal ( parallel / perpendicular ) distribution of scattering angles ; perpendicular alignments can be easily accounted for by the usual mechanism .",
    "antonucci & barvainis suggest that the parallel lpqs and the few seyfert 1s that exhibit weak parallel polarization may contain disks or tori with very large opening angles , which could produce parallel polarization by scattering .    the stockman , moore & angel survey covered bright objects from a variety of catalogues , and was not statistically complete in any meaningful sense . to complement it ,",
    "fugmann & meisenheimer studied a sample of faint 5ghz radio sources , and more recently , impey , lawrence & tapia studied the optical polarization of a complete sample of radio sources , also selected at 5ghz .",
    "impey , lawrence & tapia s complete 5ghz sample included both radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "since hpqs are known to exhibit strong variability , it is possible that they may sometimes drop below the 3% threshold and are at risk of being labelled lpqs on the strength of a single measurement .",
    "discovering a trend of polarization increasing with radio compactness , impey , lawrence & tapia note that they ` can not exclude the possibility that _ all _ quasars with compact radio emission have @xmath27 , at least some of the time ' .",
    "again , this would support a division of radio - loud quasars into those which are part of the blazar family , aligned such that their radio core would appear compact , and those whose beaming axis is not so closely aligned with the line of sight to earth .",
    "fugmann & meisenheimer s results also suggest that many compact radio objects not otherwise noted for optical variability exhibit polarization properties characteristic of blazars .",
    "robson notes that the polarization properties of _ radio - quiet _ quasars have not been well measured , but are tightly constrained in the optical as being very low  low enough to be attributed to thermal emission .",
    "one unanswered question for the unification model is why type 2 spectra are not seen in quasars .",
    "peterson offers two suggestions : that the molecular torus surrounding such a powerful central engine is thinned to the point of ineffectiveness ; or that ` quasar 2s ' exist but have been misidentified as something else , perhaps the ultraluminous far infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "robson pursues the latter hypothesis in the shape of iras galaxy iras fsc 10214 + 4724 .",
    "this remarkable object , at @xmath28 , appears to be gravitationally lensed , to be undergoing a starburst phase , _ and _ to contain an active nucleus !",
    "images @xcite taken through polarizing filters reveal a polarization of about 16% regardless of aperture , but ambiguous indications of any alignment effect .",
    "polarized spectra @xcite reveal broad quasar - like emission lines .",
    "dust scattering from an active nucleus is proposed as the most likely source of the polarization , but scattered light from a blanketed starburst might also provide an explanation . iras 09104 + 4109",
    "@xcite is also notable as an iras galaxy containing a powerful radio source and with a constant nuclear polarization of @xmath29 , although the polarization is misaligned with its radio structure ( possibly due to the geometry of thin regions in its blanketing dust ) .",
    "both antonucci and robson speculate that future analyses of the most luminous iras galaxies will reveal some ( perhaps ten percent ) of them to be hiding the missing type 2 quasars .",
    "radio galaxies form the remaining category of agn .",
    "most of the agn sources considered so far have been radio - quiet , except for the blazars which are dominated by strongly beamed radiation over many decades of their spectrum .",
    "radio galaxies join the 5 - 10% of quasars in the distinct class of radio - loud agn . reviewing the status of high redshift radio galaxies , mccarthy notes that the distinction between radio galaxies and radio quasars is becoming blurred as the host galaxies of quasars have been identified for quasars with @xmath30 .",
    "classically , the distinction had been that a powerful radio source was a ` quasar ' if the host galaxy could not be seen beneath the active nucleus ; an ` n galaxy ' if the nucleus was exceptionally bright but did not wash out all traces of the starlight ; or an ordinary radio galaxy otherwise .",
    "today , radio galaxies are classified on the basis of two distinct sets of properties : their optical emission lines and their radio structure .",
    "mccarthy notes that broad line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) , i.e.  those with hi lines having widths over 2,000 km / s , tend to have the morphological classification of ` n galaxies ' , and their broad line spectra are similar to those exhibited by seyfert 1s .",
    "narrow line radio galaxy ( nlrg ) spectra have only narrow lines for both permitted and forbidden transitions ; blrgs have narrow forbidden line spectra similar to those of nlrgs .    a distinction is often made between ` nuclear ' and ` extended ' emission , but isolating the nucleus from any extended emission region is not trivial when a 2  slit encompasses more than 10 kpc of an object at @xmath31 . if spectroscopy can be performed on distinct regions of a radio galaxy ( an operation not possible with unresolved quasars ) , the properties of the spectra would enable the composition of the different parts of the galaxy to be identified .",
    "similarly , imaging polarimetry has the potential to be an invaluable tool to determine the properties of different parts of the emission . but",
    "both techniques are limited in practice by the faintness of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "the optical radiation emitted by radio galaxies is thought to be a combination of starlight and nebular emission from the host galaxy , and a quasar - like ( power - law ) component originating in the active nucleus hidden in the heart of the galaxy . [",
    "note that at this stage we need make no assumptions about the _ reason _ for the shape of the quasar spectrum , but only utilise its profile .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the quasar spectrum could be synthesised from a suitable combination of blackbody curves . ]",
    "manzini & di serego alighieri tested this three - component hypothesis by modelling radio galaxy spectra at rest frame wavelengths from 0.2@xmath32 m  to 1.0@xmath32 m .",
    "starlight from the host galaxy was modelled as the synthetic spectrum of bruzual & charlot for a galaxy with an initial burst of star formation and no subsequent formation .",
    "nebular emission was modelled with a spectrum selected from aller .",
    "the active nuclear component was modelled by the composite radio - loud quasar spectrum of cristiani & vio , and attenuated according to different distributions of dust grains which might be present to scatter nuclear light into the line of sight to earth .",
    "manzini & di serego alighieri applied their modelling to a small sample of radio galaxies at redshifts ranging from 0.11 to 2.63 , and have demonstrated that their observed magnitudes ( by multiwaveband photometry ) are consistent with artificial spectra synthesised from three such components .",
    "the contribution of the starlight becomes greater to longer wavelengths , while the nuclear component decreases . for five out of their six galaxies , the stellar component of the light",
    "has become dominant by a rest - frame wavelength of 0.5@xmath32 m ; in 3c 277.2  @xmath33",
    "the starlight only exceeds the nuclear component at about 0.85@xmath32 m .",
    "hence the ` galaxy plus quasar ' model predicts that starlight should dominate the infrared output of radio galaxies , while nuclear emission is predominant in the ultraviolet .",
    "hammer , lefvre & angonin confirm that the ultraviolet @xmath34 nm light from @xmath35 3c radio galaxies is dominated by the presence of an active nucleus .    we have already noted (  [ polinseyferts ] ) that the distinction between blrgs and nlrgs can be interpreted as a type 1 / type 2 orientation effect , with the blr obscured by an assumed molecular torus in those galaxies classed nlrgs .",
    "quasars and radio galaxies have been shown to have comparable emission line luminosities , arising in emission line regions less than 1 kpc in diameter @xcite .",
    "if the unification model is the correct model to apply to radio galaxies , then manzini & di serego alighieri are correct to model their ` quasar ' component as scattered into the line of sight by dust ; and their results show that radio galaxies can be accurately modelled as containing quasar cores ( with molecular tori of dimensions less than 1 kpc ) , with core light scattered by plausible ( albeit idealized ) distributions of dust .",
    "if the infrared emission of radio galaxies is dominated by starlight , then studies of the variation of their @xmath0-band magnitudes with redshift should tell us something about galactic evolution .",
    "lilly & longair produced a @xmath36 plot , or _",
    "hubble diagram _ , for 3cr radio galaxies ,",
    "i.e.  for those radio galaxies with the most powerful radio emissions .",
    "two features were evident in the resulting hubble diagram : the dispersion of the @xmath0-magnitudes about the average value remained constant up to @xmath37 , but the average magnitude evolved with redshift such that galaxies at @xmath35 were about 1 mag more luminous than at @xmath38 .",
    "eales & rawlings summarise the natural interpretation of these findings : low dispersion implies that the radio galaxies were not passing through any transient phase in their evolution ( which would have caused wider variation in their luminosity ) over the span of redshifts covered .",
    "the declining luminosity to lower redshifts is consistent with a period of star formation at @xmath39 , followed by passive evolution as stars of decreasing mass reach the end of their lives .",
    "this seems perfectly reasonable since nearby radio galaxies are known to lie within giant ellipticals with a small spread of absolute magnitude @xcite , and a similar evolutionary model has been suggested for radio - quiet elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "imaging of the rest - frame visible structure of radio galaxies out to @xmath4 shows many of them to have dynamically relaxed structures , suggesting that these are active elliptical galaxies , too @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that many distant radio galaxies at @xmath40 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see below ) do not have elliptical morphologies : an evolving elliptical model alone can not explain the disturbed morphology of these objects , so at best a modified evolving elliptical model is needed .",
    "[ it has also been suggested that the radio galaxies are in fact young objects which pass through a radio - loud phase only a few hundred myr after a rapid star - forming phase itself lasting of order 100 myr @xcite . ]",
    "lilly & longair s hubble diagram suffers from the unavoidable selection effect that 3cr galaxies contain the most powerful radio sources .",
    "eales et al .   therefore analysed a 90% complete set of radio galaxies selected at lower radio luminosities in the b2 and 6c catalogues , and created a hubble diagram allowing the @xmath0-magnitudes of 3cr galaxies to be compared to those whose radio output was only one - sixth as strong . analyzing the diagram above and below the natural threshold of @xmath41",
    ", they found that the low redshift b2/6c galaxies had @xmath0-magnitudes statistically identical to the 3cr sample , but at @xmath42 , the 3cr sample was brighter by a median 0.6 magnitudes . demonstrating that sources of bias have either been eliminated or would make their result stronger , eales et al .",
    "argue that the @xmath0-band emission of the brightest radio galaxies must be contaminated by light from a source whose luminosity is correlated with the radio strength of the galaxy  presumably direct or indirect @xmath0-band emission from the active nucleus itself ( but see below ) .",
    "eales & rawlings note that hubble diagram for the 6c / b2 galaxies ( assumed to be unpolluted by nuclear emission ) follows a curve for _ no _ stellar evolution ; the 3c hubble diagram which had previously been interpreted as indicating stellar evolution rather represents a series of galaxies showing no evolutionary effects , hosting nuclear sources which tend to be brighter at higher redshift by the selection effect of a flux - limited radio sample .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the apparent ` no evolution ' result occurs because of a cosmic conspiracy : the host galaxies of the radio sources evolve in the same way as radio - quiet brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "the @xmath36 hubble diagram for bcgs also suggests an unphysical no - evolution scenario , which must be accounted for by postulating evolution in the galactic structure whose net effect counteracts that of stellar evolution .",
    "the most likely explanation is ongoing formation according to hierarchical clustering models .",
    "radio galaxies are preferentially found in clusters at high redshift , so it would not be surprising for their behaviour to follow that of bcgs ; while the fact that low - redshift radio galaxies are not preferentially found in clusters should make us suspicious of accepting lilly & longair s continuous hubble diagram across the @xmath41 morphology break .",
    "best , longair & rttgering argue that @xmath0-band emission from the active nucleus can not contribute more than 15% ( typically 4% ) to the brightness of a 3cr radio galaxy , nor cause more than 0.3 mag of brightening in 3cr objects over 6c objects .",
    "ruling out the possibility that 3cr objects contain more young stars , they suggest rather that 3cr objects simply contain greater masses of stars , and cite evidence @xcite that if the central engine is a black hole whose accretion rate depends on the material available in the host galaxy , then the mass of stars in the galaxy will be correlated with the radio , and hence the optical @xcite .",
    "the radio classification of radio - loud agn distinguishes those which are ` lobe - dominated ' and those which are ` core - dominated ' @xcite . a more detailed discussion of the different radio structures observed in radio galaxies is given by miley .",
    "measurements of radio flux density , @xmath43 , at different frequencies allow a power law spectrum to be fitted to the source , characterised by a spectral index @xmath44 , such that @xmath45 .",
    "core - dominated radio sources tend to have flat spectra ( @xmath46 ) and often show a single kpc - scale jet ; in fact , most core - dominated radio sources would fall into the category of blazars rather than radio galaxies @xcite  and there is recent evidence that radio galaxies which are core - dominated exhibit variable optical polarization due to synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "lobe - dominated radio structures emit radio waves from a locus of space which can span many tens of kiloparsecs , up to 3 mpc in the case of 3c 236 @xcite .",
    "the extended lobes of radiation are zones of synchrotron emission , and are fed by a stream of relativistic electrons flowing out of the poles of the central engine .",
    "the radio spectra of lobe - dominated sources tend to be steep , with @xmath47 .",
    "a further division is made according to the criteria of fanaroff & riley , whence sources with spectral luminosity density @xmath48 whz@xmath11 are class fr ii , and those less luminous are class fr i. the class fr i sources are usually associated with radio galaxies alone , and the most prominent parts of the the radio structure ( ` hot spots ' ) lie closer to the core than to the edge of the radio structure .",
    "both quasars and radio galaxies can exhibit class fr ii structure , and their hotspots lie closer to the edge of the emission region than to the core @xcite .",
    "such sources usually have a compact radio core co - located with the optical nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "all radio - loud quasars and many class fr ii radio galaxies are asymmetric , with a kpc - scale jet only visible between the core and one of the lobes @xcite . the most likely explanation of the asymmetry again invokes an orientation argument , with those jets travelling towards us closest to our line of sight being most doppler - brightened and the counterjets similarly doppler - supressed @xcite ; hence quasars , where we are thought to be looking close to ` down the jet ' , are always asymmetric , while radio galaxies are viewed closer to ` sideways on ' and the two jets can appear to be of comparable brightness . this has been borne out by the discovery of the laing - garrington effect @xcite , where the radio emission from the far side of such a source suffers depolarization by its passage through the interstellar material in the host galaxy and hence appears less polarized than the radio emission from the lobe associated with the jet .    for nearby radio galaxies , class fr ii sources",
    "are normally found in ( otherwise normal ) giant elliptical galaxies , although not in galaxies forming part of rich clusters .",
    "nearby fr i sources , however , are very likely to be hosted by more luminous ellipticals , often the type d or cd galaxies which dominate rich clusters @xcite . at high redshift , though , there is no clear evidence for a distinction between the richness of clusters hosting fr i and fr ii classes ; and the morphology of the host galaxy is often distorted by the presence of knots .",
    "we will return to this in the next chapter , in a discussion of the alignment effect .",
    "the presence or absence of strong radio emission seems to be a fundamental characteristic of agn , and is strongly linked with optical morphology : peterson notes that it is ` true in general ' that radio - quiet agn ( seyferts , most quasars ) are found in spiral galaxies [ but see ridgway & stockton and references therein for evidence of elliptical hosts being common in radio - quiet quasars ] , while strong radio sources ( radio quasars , radio galaxies and blazars ) tend to have elliptical hosts .",
    "further , the host galaxies of radio quasars are , on average , 0.7 mag brighter in absolute @xmath14-magnitude than radio - quiet quasar hosts .",
    "the absence of fr i class quasars may follow from the strength of the central engine : if the nucleus is powerful enough to be optically classified a quasar , then its jets may _ de facto _ be strong enough to produce fr ii class radio structure .    the first indications that orientation effects may be important in understanding the nature of radio sources came with the discovery of apparent superluminal motion in four of the brightest radio sources @xcite .",
    "superluminal observations can be understood if the source is ejecting matter at relativistic velocities along a path close to the line of sight to the observer @xcite ; in which case superluminal sources must be the beamed subset of some parent population .",
    "this model is now generally accepted as the explanation of superluminal radio sources and is consistent with other observed features of the superluminal sources  including blazar properties and asymmetric jets @xcite .",
    "the unification model predicts that radio galaxies should not exhibit superluminal motion .",
    "of cohen et al.s four original superluminal sources , three were quasars but the fourth was classed as a radio galaxy .",
    "this object , 3c 120 , is a nearby @xmath49 galaxy which has been variously classified as a core - dominated broad - line radio galaxy , and as a radio - loud seyfert 1 with disturbed morphology @xcite . if we set aside 3c 120 as an anomalous object , what of other agn ?",
    "a survey of relativistic motion in all sources of known vlbi core size , appearing in the literature 19861992 , was assembled by ghisellini et al .  .",
    "of the sources for which speeds were recorded , definite superluminal velocities were observed in all 11 blls , 23 out of 29 quasars ( with 5 more having superluminal upper limits ) , and none of 6 radio galaxies .",
    "one radio galaxy ( 0108 + 388 ) displayed an apparent speed of @xmath50 , and another ( 0710 + 439 ) had an upper limit of @xmath51 quoted .",
    "neither of these findings are strong enough to prove the existence of superluminal motion in a radio galaxy .",
    "the unification model hypothesises that radio - loud quasars are an oriented subset of some intrinsically radio - loud parent population .",
    "barthel poses the question , ` is every quasar beamed ? ' , and reviews the evidence . as discussed above , those quasars which show superluminal motion",
    "are likely to be beamed , and we have also considered the evidence of the laing - garrington effect .",
    "a beaming hypothesis can explain several statistical properties , including the correlation between brightness and component motion , and more limited statistics showing that lobe - dominated sources display lower superluminal velocities than core - dominated ( more closely aligned ? ) sources . against that must be set the problem of why certain radio - loud quasars have very large extended structures , whose deprojected linear size would be enormous ; and the statistical finding that the asymmetric brightness of jets over counterjets is , on average , larger than can be accounted for by beaming effects alone if the parent population is of _ randomly oriented quasars_.    barthel goes on to demonstrate that by assuming the parent population is of powerful radio galaxies , with quasars as the beamed subset , the statistics of jet / counterjet asymmetries can be justified ; and the sizes of the largest radio galaxies are such that the largest superluminal quasars are not too large in the context of the parent population .",
    "radio - loud quasars and fr ii radio galaxies at @xmath52 in the 3crr catalogue were compared ; after the exclusion of unsuitable candidates , 12 quasars and 30 radio galaxies remained , with the linear dimensions of the galaxy radio structure averaging about twice that of the quasar mean .",
    "the relative numbers suggest that a source will appear as a quasar if viewed within @xmath53 of its axis , and as a radio galaxy otherwise .",
    "this being the case , the quasars should be foreshortened 1.8 times as much as the radio galaxies , consistent with the observed factor of 2 .",
    "[ if the radio - quiet unbeamed counterparts of the quasars really are the far infrared galaxies , barthel notes that the number count statistics are consistent with such unification : there are 11 quasars for every 49 far infrared galaxies . ]",
    "further evidence for radio galaxy / radio quasar unification comes from other wavebands @xcite : blazars and quasars are known to be strong in their x - ray emission , while radio galaxies are weak ; seyfert 1s are luminous in x - rays while seyfert 2s are not , suggesting that the molecular torus is an effective shield of x - ray radiation . on the other hand",
    ", the torus viewed from any angle ought to be bright in the far infrared because of its own heat , and detection statistics of both radio galaxies and quasars in this waveband bear this out .",
    "two pieces of evidence oppose unification , however : claims that the host galaxies of radio quasars differ significantly from radio galaxies @xcite ; and that extended radio sources lie in denser environments than compact sources @xcite .",
    "robson and antonucci draw differing conclusions on how blazars fit into the unification picture .",
    "we have already seen how antonucci proposes that blls and ovvs are attributed to different luminosities in otherwise similar synchrotron cores . recall that under this scheme , blls are postulated to be blazars with the most powerful synchrotron sources , whose emission effectively drowns out the broad lines from the blr which lies in the line of sight .",
    "robson suggests that bl lac objects are not end - on quasars , claiming rather than blls are beamed fr i objects and ovvs are beamed fr ii objects  and noting differences in the radio polarization properties of blls and ovvs which hint that blls are more likely to have shocks in their jets .",
    "the absence of emission lines in blls would be related to the weakness of the output of the line - emitting clouds rather than the overpowering strength of the optical synchrotron core emission .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "find that their statistics from a survey of 105 radio - loud agn support this idea .",
    "antonucci warns against the automatic identification of the bll / ovv classification with the fanaroff - riley class , noting that some famous bl lacs are fr class ii @xcite .",
    "what is clear , is that many blazars have sufficient radio output in their diffuse emission alone to make it into the 3c or 4c catalogues ; and so ` misaligned blazars ' not beamed towards the earth must be part of a unified continuum with some other classes of agn which are _ already known_.    one modification to the standard unification model is that some putative radio galaxies may be quasars obscured not by their molecular torus , but by other obscuring material .",
    "for instance , infrared spectroscopy revealed a broad h@xmath44 line in ` nlrg ' 3c 22 @xcite , suggesting that this source may be in the quasar orientation , but with opaque material obscuring much of the light from the active nucleus .",
    "similarly polarization measurements of 3c 109 @xcite can be understood if there is a hidden quasar core whose light suffers polarization by transmission through dust .",
    "if such obscured quasars are common ( * ? ?",
    "* 234 could be another example ) , then many putative radio galaxies may have their axis closer to their line of sight to earth than hitherto thought , and orientation statistics will be affected accordingly .",
    "two major questions remained unanswered by current unification models .",
    "why do some galaxies and quasars produce jets strong enough to drive radio emission , and others not ?",
    "why is radio emission is only found in elliptical galaxies ?",
    "we shall not pursue these questions or debate the nature of blazars here , as such matters lie outside the scope of this thesis , but pause to note that work is still very much in progress on the refining of the unification model .",

    "study of these alignments can help confirm or refute the appropriateness of the unification hypothesis to describe individual radio galaxies , and statistically , the class as a whole .",
    "since active nuclei lie within host galaxies whose stars emit unpolarized blackbody radiation , the measured polarization of any active galaxy will be that of the active nucleus diluted by starlight .",
    "it is important to distinguish whether polarization figures quoted in a given case are those of the raw measurement , or corrected for removing the unpolarized stellar intensity to yield the polarization of the nucleus .",
    "the contribution of starlight diminishes in the near ultraviolet and at shorter wavelengths ; rest - frame ultraviolet measurements can be presumed to give a good indication of the nuclear polarization .",
    "the 1980 review paper of angel & stockman summarised what was then known of the visible and infrared polarization of extragalactic objects : the three classes of active galaxies known to produce polarised light were blazars , quasars and seyfert 2s . although the spectra of blrgs suggested that they were related to quasars and seyfert 2s , their relative faintness meant that polarimetric studies of low redshift radio galaxies did not appear in the literature until the early 1980s @xcite , and high redshift studies a decade later @xcite .",
    "angel & stockman wrote before the unification hypothesis had become popular , and reviewed numerous mechanisms which might account for the low visible / infrared polarizations observed in many seyferts .",
    "originally , seyfert polarizations ( of order 1% ) were attributed to the visible high - frequency tail of synchrotron radiation .",
    "multicolour and spectroscopic studies of seyfert polarization , however , showed that in most seyferts , both the core continuum light and the emission lines were polarised , and the polarization ( corrected for the stellar contribution ) was stronger in the blue than in the red , but with little rotation of position angle .",
    "these facts suggested that the total light emerging from the central engine was being polarised by some subsequent interaction , most probably with dust .",
    "[ we dealt with this in some detail in  [ polinseyferts ] . ]",
    "the discovery of type 1 features in the polarised spectra of seyfert 2s was the key to the first stage of unification @xcite , the realization that orientation alone might be the distinguishing feature between the two classes of seyferts . antonucci s review paper describes how the prototypical seyfert ngc 1068 was investigated and found to be generating visible / ultraviolet light polarised at 16% in its nucleus . since electrons scatter light equally strongly at all wavelengths whereas dust ( via rayleigh scattering and similar mechanisms ) preferentially scatters blue light , it is implied that the scattering medium in ngc 1068 may be free electrons . other seyferts show evidence of higher nuclear polarizations at shorter wavelengths , characteristic of dust .",
    "most yield a polarization orientation perpendicular to the radio structure , as would be expected for scattering .    similarly , by the time of antonucci s paper",
    ", evidence was accumulating that blrgs and nlrgs were the type 1 and type 2 classes for radio galaxies analogous to the classification of seyferts .",
    "the picture seemed to be clearest for radio galaxies at redshifts @xmath40 , where light measured in the @xmath13-filter on earth corresponded to rest frame ultraviolet ( @xmath54 nm ) emissions in the agn , uncontaminated by significant starlight .",
    "the first measured high redshift radio galaxy polarization was reported in _ nature _ by di serego alighieri et al .",
    "; and since then , mounting evidence @xcite has generally borne out the empirical rule of thumb @xcite that distant radio galaxies @xmath55 should display diluted polarizations of 5% or more , oriented roughly perpendicular to the radio lobe structure .",
    "in addition to this polarimetric evidence ( reviewed in more detail below ,  [ polevi ] ) , the apparent alignment of the knotted optical structures of high redshift radio galaxies with the radio axes @xcite lent weight to the concept of the torus and central engine proposed by the unification model . as we shall see in  [ aligneff ] , this so - called ` alignment effect ' is manifested most strongly in the agn with the most powerful radio emission , and is intimately linked to the unification model and the presumed scattering mechanism for polarization .    while not proven  and",
    "inevitably suffering from a number of pathological cases which fit poorly  the unification model is now generally accepted , to the extent of being the foundation of the first textbooks on agn to become available @xcite .",
    "the model must stand or fall , however , according to objective tests , not by indications of its popularity among astronomers .",
    "as new technology becomes available to the astronomical community , it is naturally the unification model which experiments are designed to test , and reinforce or falsify . with the recent availability of infrared arrays and polarisers @xcite , it has become possible to extend imaging polarimetry into the @xmath0-band .",
    "the work contained in this thesis represents the first studies of linear polarization in high redshift radio galaxies in this waveband .",
    "modern astronomical detectors @xcite make a range of observational techniques available .",
    "light from distant objects can be imaged on a detector array , and the light intensity measured in a synthetic aperture covering any part of the image .",
    "the light can be dispersed to form a spectrum or passed through an analyser which separates orthogonally polarised components .",
    "both spectroscopy and polarimetry are time - consuming procedures for faint objects : the former disperses the minimal available light into its component wavelengths , and the latter requires an accurate measurement of the intensity difference between the two orthogonal components of the light .",
    "only recently has technology made it possible to employ both techniques simultaneously and perform spectropolarimetry of high - redshift radio galaxies , and our capabilities are limited : even with the light - gathering capacity of the 10 m keck telescope , the resulting spectra must be rebinned at low resolution to extract a meaningful signal @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if the orientation of the polarization is already known , a 4 m class telescope can obtain a spectrum of light polarized in the known direction in a reasonable time @xcite .",
    "the unique value of spectropolarimetry lies in its ability to identify the spectrum of scattered light present in the total signal , and so trace the emission properties of whatever hidden component is illuminating the scattering medium .",
    "( the spectrum will also , of course , give us an indication of whether polarization is attributable to a mechanism other than scattering . )",
    "images taken through a polarizing filter have their own value ; photopolarimetry ( i.e.  photometry of polarized light ) can be performed in synthetic apertures , yielding a polarization map or a study of the polarization of individual structures in an object of complex morphology .",
    "but again , the faintest sources are not amenable to a pixel - by - pixel polarimetric analysis ; regions several pixels square may need to be binned together to obtain an acceptable signal - to - noise ; and many of the radio galaxy figures given in the literature are simply polarizations integrated over the whole structure .    where photopolarimetry is available in multiple wavebands , models of the polarized spectra of radio galaxies can be fitted against these broadband measurements : manzini & di serego alighieri used this technique to establish their result (  [ rgspectrum ] ) that if the radio galaxies sampled consist of stars , nebular emission and an excess component in the form of a power - law , then starlight is still their dominant component in the near infrared .      while observations of the rest frame ultraviolet have been important in polarimetric studies of agn , on the assumption that the host galaxy contribution to the ultraviolet emission is negligible ,",
    "the infrared is important for the opposite reason .",
    "radio galaxies , as a species of agn distinguished by their radio properties but [ ideally ] unremarkable in their optical emission , could be used as examples of ` normal ' galaxies at high redshift ( hence having experienced less cosmological evolution than nearby galaxies ) .",
    "they could be detected at high redshifts by virtue of their radio emission , and then studied optically in the hope that the active nucleus has not had too great an influence on their evolution ( compared to ` inactive ' galaxies ) , and is not polluting the light from the host galaxy . at high redshifts , of course ,",
    "light originating in the visible or near infrared arrives at the earth shifted into longer infrared wavelengths .",
    "the atmospheric @xmath0-band window lies at a convenient wavelength for studying the near infrared properties of objects at @xmath35 , and the previous chapter reviewed how the @xmath36 hubble diagram for 3cr radio galaxies @xcite suggested that the observed @xmath0-band light was essentially stellar emission from passively evolving elliptical galaxies .",
    "so in the late 1980s , @xmath0-band studies of radio galaxies were thought to be revealing the properties of young elliptical galaxies . as we have seen (  [ hubblek ] ) , this has now been called into question by studies of fainter radio sources @xcite ; and it seems that a substantial fraction of the observed @xmath0-band light in 3cr galaxies must come from the active nucleus after all .",
    "while the hubble diagram is a useful tool to analyse the statistical properties of a set of galaxies , it tells us nothing about individual galaxies .",
    "studies of the polarization , morphology and spectra of 3cr galaxies are needed to determine the properties of their @xmath0-band excess ; an understanding of the influence of the excess in individual radio galaxies is essential if we are to salvage their role as probes of galactic evolution .",
    "the new observations presented in this thesis are polarized @xmath0-band images of nine radio galaxies , including seven from the 3cr catalogue .",
    "the signal - to - noise limit prevents the meaningful analysis of any structure finer than lobes of individual bright objects . in some cases ,",
    "polarimetry in other optical bands is available and can be used together with our findings for comparison with synthetic spectra . in all cases ,",
    "an upper limit can be assigned to the maximum contribution of any scattered component to the @xmath0-band light , providing an independent means of determining the influence of the active nucleus on the apparent luminosity of 3cr sources .    in the light of our measurements , and those in the literature , it is then possible to model the most likely mechanism giving rise to the observed polarizations .",
    "if the strength of the @xmath0-band emission is related to the power output of the central engine , the simplest explanation of this result is that a significant fraction of a radio galaxy s infrared light emerges from the active nucleus in a restricted cone , and enters our line of sight after scattering by dust or electrons . in this case , as for the visible and ultraviolet light , the scattered infrared light should be polarised perpendicular to the direction of the radio jet .",
    "as we shall see in the rest of this chapter , the relationship between the polarization and structure of radio galaxies measured at radio , visible and infrared wavelengths is already well documented , and we shall discuss the properties of our representative sample of radio galaxies in this context .    the motivation for performing studies of the @xmath0-band polarizations of high redshift radio galaxies , therefore , is to probe the origin of their @xmath0-band emission .",
    "a finding of no polarization would suggest that infrared light could be used as a safe indicator of the properties of the host galaxy ( but would make it hard to explain the suspected infrared alignment effect ) .",
    "a finding of infrared light polarised perpendicular to the radio axis would suggest scattered nuclear light ; and where polarimetry exists in other wavebands , would provide a longer baseline to test the likely origin of the polarisation  electron scattering , dust scattering and direct sight of a synchrotron source each have a distinct dependence on wavelength .",
    "any other finding would be an invitation to further scientific study !      as in any scientific investigation ,",
    "a thorough error analysis is required to give the final data their due weight .",
    "polarimetry , however , is more demanding than other forms of photometry .",
    "measuring a polarization is akin to determining the magnitude of a vector , a definite positive quantity . while the measurements of the vector s components may fluctuate about zero for an unpolarised object , the magnitude stubbornly remains greater than zero and must be ` debiased ' accordingly .",
    "the astronomical literature contains not a few papers by statisticians @xcite and careful polarimetrists accusing astronomers of failing to debias their work adequately , although most 1990s papers on radio galaxy polarizations do address this issue .",
    "given the need for debiasing polarization figures and the low signal - to - noise inevitable when studying objects at high redshift , a great deal of work in this thesis has been devoted to the accurate debiasing and error estimation of the data available .",
    "much of the work has been published in the form of a step - by - step guide to polarimetry @xcite ; the format has been retained , though the work has been refined and updated , in chapter [ stoch ] of this thesis .        ccd technology of the mid-1980s allowed the optical structures of high redshift radio galaxies to be investigated for the first time .",
    "radio galaxies at @xmath35 were found to look nothing like the giant ellipticals associated with lower redshift radio galaxies ; rather , the high redshift galaxies were often elongated and contained two or more bright ` knots ' rather than a single identifiable nucleus @xcite .",
    "after further studies of the most powerful radio sources , it was found that the major axis of the optical elongated or knotted structures was usually aligned within a few tens of degrees of the radio axis @xcite  an association which has become known as the ` alignment effect ' .",
    "subsequent investigations with detectors sensitive to visible light revealed that the alignment effect cuts in at redshifts @xmath56 @xcite , and that the knotted optical structures are known to be emitting _",
    "continuum _ radiation , ruling out theories that the aligned structures are attributable to line - emitting gas clouds .",
    "more recent observations @xcite confirm the alignment of the rest - frame ultraviolet emitting regions with the radio structure .",
    "there is no consensus at present about the mechanism which gives rise to the knotted structure ; current observations continue to investigate the extent to which the alignment effect is associated with emission from the active nucleus .",
    "two key tests of the relationship with the nuclear emission are whether the effect becomes weaker to longer wavelengths , and whether it becomes less prominent in less powerful radio galaxies .",
    "the @xmath41 cut - off suggests that either there is an evolutionary process at work , or that we are observing a property of the rest - frame ultraviolet which does not extend to the rest - frame visible .",
    "infrared observations of twenty 1 jy galaxies at @xmath57 @xcite show little evidence for extended structure at rest - frame visible wavelengths .",
    "conversely , @xmath18-band images of the low - redshift @xmath58 radio galaxy 3c 195 reveal a distinct aligned ultraviolet structure @xcite , and a bipolar aligned structure is also seen in ultraviolet images of cygnus a @xcite .",
    "recent @xmath18-band imaging of the nearby radio galaxy ngc 6251 @xcite has revealed several extended regions of emission : the most prominent feature of this radiation lies interior to a dust ring , is nearly _ perpendicular _ to the radio jet axis , and has a polarization below 10% .",
    "the first @xmath18-band survey of low redshift radio galaxies ( 15 3cr objects at @xmath59 ) @xcite found evidence for @xmath60 alignment between the radio axis and the @xmath18-band structure in 6 objects ( two such alignments would be expected by chance alone ) .",
    "two different mechanisms seemed to be at work : three sources showed alignment in the optical structure surrounding the radio nucleus , while the other three appeared to have a merging companion galaxy close to the radio axis .",
    "of the three sources with an elongated nucleus , 3c 348 was also elongated in @xmath13 but gave no evidence for knots in either band , while the other two examples displayed knots in @xmath18 but no elongation or knots in @xmath13 .",

    "is this indicative of some scattering mechanism perpendicular to the main radio structure ?",
    "it is difficult to conceive of a mechanism which allows a brilliant central engine to emit light in two perpendicular directions without also leaking such light towards earth ; yet the morphology ( and indeed the high polarization which implies that any dilution is limited ) do not suggest that we are seeing a central engine directly in t2 .",
    "could t1 be a chance alignment or a satellite galaxy ?",
    "this would explain its presence but not the overall parallel polarization .",

    "the keck spectropolarimetry unequivocally demonstrates the presence of a polarized component strong in the near - ultraviolet and declining into the green ; our @xmath0-band polarimetry can not identify this polarized component in the near - infrared , suggesting that nebular emission and starlight are dominating this waveband .",

    "its apparent age and redshift are hard to reconcile and the reported 40% polarization did not help to clarify the picture . we have ruled out a @xmath0-band polarization of that order ; most of the discussion of this galaxy s peculiar properties can be found in  [ d53w091 ] and in more detail in leyshon , dunlop & eales .",
    "we have seen how radio - weak galaxies only display the alignment effect over small scales , up to about 15kpc @xcite ; the separation between 53w091 and companion 3a is of this order ( 16@xmath10kpc ) and so its good alignment is in keeping with what is known for 7c galaxies .",
    "we have seen (  [ 53wgeom ] ) , however , that the polarization in 3a can not be reconciled with a scattering model ; and the result for 3a is too tentative to warrant developing alternative models .",

    "the results can be compared with the infrared properties of nearby radio galaxies and with the visible - light properties of high redshift objects (  [ polevi ] )  always bearing in mind that our sample of nine diverse objects is of limited statistical significance .",
    "some nearby radio galaxies ( cen a , ic 5063 , 3c 234 ) have been observed in the @xmath0-band (  [ polevi ] ) and found to have polarizations of order 10% , oriented perpendicular to the radio jet . in these cases",
    ", it seems that the standard scattering hypothesis is the best explanation .",
    "3c 233.1 is 5% polarized in @xmath0 but less than 0.5% in the visible , suggesting that dust extinction may reduce the contribution of visible scattered light .",
    "our sources are being observed at rest - frame wavelengths somewhat shorter than the 2.2@xmath32 m  @xmath0-band , so if 3c 233.1 were used as a benchmark , we might expect perpendicular polarizations somewhat lower than 5% .",
    "in fact our measurements range between zero and 20% , all in the ` ballpark ' defined by these earlier @xmath0-band observations .    we have noted (  [ poltrend ] ) how cimatti et al .   analyzed the properties of 42 radio galaxies at @xmath85 and searched for trends with both the observed polarization and their estimate of the underlying nuclear polarization .",
    "all their conclusions were based on light emitted at rest frame wavelengths between 0.2@xmath32 m  and 0.7@xmath32 m , so the observations of this thesis do not overlap in @xmath88 with theirs .",

    "all of our sources lie at @xmath40 , but some are certainly polarized below 7% in @xmath0-band , the firmest results being the unpolarized mrc 0156@xmath3252 and the 3% polarized 3c 22 and 3c 41 .",
    "jannuzi reports that 3c 22 is no more than 5% polarized in the @xmath13-band ; 3c 41 fulfills the rule of thumb in @xmath13 but not in @xmath2 .",
    "the rule , however , is a rule for radio galaxies , so if these objects are actually obscured quasars the rule is not applicable to them .",
    "spectropolarimetry for 3c 356 @xmath7 @xcite shows the rule satisfied in this source at 0.2@xmath32 m  but not at 0.4@xmath32 m , while our results indicate that it probably obeys the rule at 1.1@xmath32 m .",
    "the handy rule of thumb , therefore , must be used with the caveat that it applies only to light emitted at visible / ultraviolet rest wavelengths .",
    "there is also a rule of thumb based on general results about alignments .",
    "radio galaxies with @xmath40 and @xmath101 were always found to have perpendicular polarizations .",
    "again , this is not found to carry into the @xmath0-band , since 3c 54 s polarization is parallel , and 3c 114 is ambiguous depending on which knots are included .",
    "neither can we sustain the rule that if a radio galaxy polarization is in parallel alignment , the polarization is always lower than 5% : the same two objects and 3c 356 may all have higher parallel polarizations .    except for 53w091 ,",
    "all the objects in our sample are very radio loud ; all lie at high redshift .",
    "they would therefore be expected to display a clear alignment effect in the visible (  [ aligneff ] ) and at least a marginal effect in the infrared .",
    "in fact the knotted sources ( table [ knotalign ] ) do display parallel aligned structures , though some ( most strikingly 3c 114 ) also have knots in perpendicular alignment  a feature not unknown in nearby radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "discerning alignments present in compact objects ( table [ compalign ] ) is , by definition , more difficult , and no clear trend is apparent in our five compact sources .",
    "clearly bright knots , where present , dominate any analysis of alignments and structure , whereas the slight extensions or faint companions of radio galaxies may not be related to the mechanism which sometimes causes aligned or perpendicular knots .",

    "the experience gained in performing the analysis for this thesis suggests that a future comprehensive polarimetry package should include the following features for two - channel wollaston prism systems with a waveplate rotating in 22.5  steps .      an imaging polarimetry package would normally function as an accessory to an imaging photometry system .",

    "all of the galaxies which appear to be polarised have large errors on the orientation of their @xmath104-vectors ; hence any apparent alignment effects are suggestive rather than definitive . but with this caveat , we note that two sources ( 3c 54 and 3c 114 ) have high polarizations oriented in roughly parallel alignment with the radio axis and extension of the optical structure  i.e. in the opposite sense to the perpendicular alignment expected under a simple scattering model .",
    "the compact galaxies 3c 22 and 3c 41 display significant polarizations of around 3% with a polarization alignment perpendicular to their radio axes ; both appear in the @xmath0-band as pointlike objects .",
    "we suggest , therefore , that in these objects , infrared light from a quasar core is being scattered into our line of sight , and forms a significant part of the total @xmath0-band flux received from these sources ; both objects may be inclined close to the @xmath105 ` boundary ' between quasar and radio galaxy properties .    in the case of mrc 0156@xmath3252 , which lies beyond a virtually dust - free part of our own galaxy , we can be reasonably certain that this radio galaxy is not polarised , and the @xmath0-band light has not been scattered before reaching us .",
    "if some of the @xmath0-band light has originated in the active nucleus , its contribution should be smaller than at visible wavelengths @xcite ; this being the case , subtraction of our image or a synthetic symmetrical galaxy could well reveal the structure of the active component at visible wavelengths , given the visible structure observed by mccarthy et al .   .",
    "it is possible that this galaxy , like 3c 22 and 3c 41 , is an obscured quasar at an intermediate orientation .    in lbds 53w091 , we can rule out the contribution of an active nucleus to providing more than @xmath106 per cent of the observed light .",
    "the majority of its @xmath0-band light , therefore , must be presumed to be due to its stellar population , and its @xmath107 colour remains consistent with an age in the range @xmath108 gyr . the nature of its companion object @xmath109 , possibly polarised and of unclear physical relationship with 53w091 , warrants further investigation .    in 3c 441 ,",
    "the polarization from object e may indicate that e is scattering light from * a * ( whose identification as the central engine would thus be vindicated ) ; the orientation of e s polarization would not be consistent with the source being located within e or f and emitting jets at @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , we favour the traditional identification of the central engine with * a*. although this object was observed at two epochs , the observational errors can not rule in or out temporal variability in polarization over a two year period .",
    "it is noteworthy that when radial profile or spectral fitting estimates @xcite are combined with our @xmath0-band data (  [ blr3constr ] ) , there are hints that the true @xmath0-band nuclear polarizations of several sources ( 3c 65 , 3c 356 , 3c 441 * a * ) are of the order of 25% .",
    "the measurement errors and uncertainties in the derivation mean that these figures are no more than indicative ; but following enrico fermi s rule of thumb that in a sufficiently complicated problem , uncertain contributions tend to cancel out each other , this can be taken as a very tentative indication for @xmath0-band nuclear polarizations of order 25% in radio galaxies .",
    "polarimetry of faint objects requires long integration times .",
    "the observing time available has permitted us to rule out the existence of very high polarizations in many of the objects studied , at least for light emitted along the line of sight to earth .",
    "it would still be possible for light emitted in other directions from these objects to be polarised .",
    "` polarization ' mentioned in these conclusions should be understood in the restricted sense of light leaving the source in the direction of earth . under the unification model , radio galaxies ( a class of agn assumed",
    "to be oriented with their jets perpendicular to that line of sight ) would be more likely to display polarization originating in scattering or synchrotron radiation in the light travelling earthwards than in directions closer to the jet .      interpreting polarization measurements",
    "is intimately linked with understanding the morphology of the knots or extensions which accompany a radio source .",
    "it is a distinct advantage to study sources in which the redshifts of the companion objects are known , so that chance alignments can be ruled out , and true near - neighbours can be identified as such . where redshifts are not available and the source lies in a rich field , multifibre spectroscopy of the sources should be scheduled .",
    "then , if an imaging polarization measurement suggests that a knot may be scattering nuclear light , the agn spectrum could be scaled and subtracted from that of the knot .",
    "the spectral and spatial profile fitting methods of best , longair & rttgering greatly complement the data available from polarimetry , since stronger limits can be placed on the nuclear polarizations if the fraction of the light due to stars can be independently identified .",
    "there would be a distinct advantage in performing polarimetry on the other objects already analysed by them , or applying their analysis ( de vaucouleurs fitting could be done on the imaging polarimetry images in good seeing ) to stacked polarimetric images .",
    "polarimetry is a cheap ` overhead ' which could be seriously considered whenever imaging or photometry is being carried out on a radio galaxy whose linear extent is such that it can easily be viewed through a focal plane mask .",
    "polarimetry complements mosaicing by spreading the image over the pixels available , and local effects are cancelled out when the waveplate is rotated through 45 . combining the two slits for imaging purposes can be integrated into the mosaicing process .",
    "the photon rate in each channel is 50% of that which would be achieved with no wollaston prism ( for both source and sky noise ) , so doubling the time per exposure would produce noise at the same level per integration as using the system without the wollaston prism . in the same spirit , applying a wollaston prism before a grating or multifibre spectroscopy system allows spectropolarimetry and spectroscopy of a given quality to be done in just twice the time of spectroscopy alone .",
    "sources in which there is evidence for scattered light from a distinct knot  such as 3c 441  are prime candidates for spectropolarimetry to be applied to their distinct knots .",
    "tracing the nuclear spectrum in the polarized spectrum of the knot would confirm the scattered light hypothesis .",
    "spectropolarimetry should also be applied to sources in which there are indications of parallel polarization , such as 3c 114 , 3c 54 and 53w091 3a .",
    "only low parallel polarizations can be produced by flattened scattering discs , and untangling the spectrum of the parallel polarized component would give a better hint at what is taking place in such sources .",
    "sources in which their are indications of a skew alignment effect with infrared structure 1020  out of line with visible structures (  [ misalign1 ] ) are also particularly interesting targets for further study , as are those where optical polarization is somewhat misaligned with radio structure (  [ misalign2 ] ) .",
    "it would be a valuable exercise to perform a full literature review and observing campaign to compare the polarization orientation with the position angles determined for structure in the radio , near - infrared , visible and near - ultraviolet bands for every agn with a published optical polarization .",
    "understanding the wavelength - dependence of the skew alignment would probe the mechanism at work in these objects .",
    "finally , all polarimetric studies must be realistic about the time required to get a useful result .",
    "low polarizations are harder to isolate than high ones ; we spent more than an hour on 3c 22 and nearly two on 3c 41 , our brightest sources ; and the errors on these are still quite large .",
    "six hours on the faint 53w091 has refuted any suggestion of 40% levels of polarization but can not give a definitive answer on the presence or absence of lower levels .",
    "the author looks forward to the days when larger telescope mirrors , parallel use of wollaston prisms and imaging spectroscopy allow the radio galaxy trends survey of cimatti et al .   to be extended to @xmath0-band observations , and the true contribution of scattered @xmath0-band light to the properties of high - redshift radio galaxies will be known .",
