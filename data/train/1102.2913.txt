    "the gravitational binding energy of a supermassive bh is completely adequate to unbind leftover gas in the surrounding galaxy .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the problem remains to find concrete evidence of bh self - regulation , and to determine whether or not accretion energy has a direct impact on the surrounding galaxy .",
    "there are some special circumstances in which accretion energy clearly has had an impact on its environment .",
    "for instance , jet activity in massive elliptical galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies deposits energy into the hot gas envelope ( see review in * ? ? ?",

    "thus , it is not clear whether bh activity in radio galaxies accounts for more than a small fraction of the bh growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the extent and the dominant mode of these interactions remain open to interpretation . in particular , it is not clear whether quasars are effectively removing the interstellar medium ( ism ) of their host galaxies during the high accretion rate episodes  those that account for the majority of the bh growth .",
    "such feedback has been postulated by numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the nlr is in some respects the ideal tracer of the interface between the galaxy and the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , as the gas is excited by the agn but extended on galaxy - wide scales . for a long time , following the seminal work of @xcite , it was thought that truly extended emission - line regions ( so - called eelrs with radii of 10 - 50 kpc ) were only found in radio - loud objects .",

    "the nebular spectra are not spatially resolved ( i.e. , the spatial distribution matches that of a standard star ) .",
    "there are six objects for which we have multiple slit positions .",
    "the range in nebular size derived from cases with multiple slit positions is @xmath38 .    in a few cases ( sdss  j1356@xmath301026 , sdss  j2126@xmath39 & sdss  j2212@xmath40 ) , the line ratios change as a function of radius and [ ] /h@xmath41  falls below three .",

    "given the luminosities of quasars in our sample and the rates of star formation in their hosts @xcite , we expect that the number of ionizing photons from the quasars exceeds that from stars by about an order of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , since quasar illumination is not necessarily isotropic and since photons from star formation are distributed more uniformly within the galaxy than those arising from the central engine , it is plausible that we may see gas excited by stars in the outer regions of the galaxy .",

    "for the present work , we explore the implications of detecting one single extended emission - line region in the sample (  6 ) .",
    "we should note that deriving nebular sizes is an ill - defined task .",
    "first of all , ionized nebulae need not have regular shapes , and so the definition of size is not necessarily well - defined .",
    "this difficulty is only exacerbated when long - slit spectra are used to define the size , since our slit may well miss spatially extended regions . furthermore , the concept of size depends sensitively on the depth of the observation .",
    "deep observations probing depths of a few times @xmath43  erg  s@xmath3  cm@xmath17  arcsec@xmath17 indeed reveal faint , extended gas with a range of morphologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the primary size uncertainties are in these systematics , which dwarf the measurement errors .",
    "we quantify the uncertainties in the following manner .",
    "first of all , since we have not included surface brightness dimming , there is a dispersion of @xmath44 dex in the sizes due to distance .",
    "secondly , and more important , narrow - line regions are not strictly round .",
    "thus , depending on the position of the long - slit , we may derive a different answer .",
    "we have found , for the six objects with multiple slit positions , that the sizes agree within @xmath45 .",
    "finally , and most difficult to quantify , the shape will likely grow more irregular as we push to lower flux limits .",
    "we have attempted to quantify this dispersion in emission line profile using the ratio between the luminosity - weighted mean width of each spatial [ ]  profile and the adopted radius measured down to a fixed surface brightness . were the nlrs all of the same shape , then the mean width would be a fixed fraction of the total size . instead , the ratio ranges from 0.2 to 4 , with a typical value of three .",
    "we thus adopt a factor of three as the overall uncertainty in the sizes . additionally , we flag as particularly uncertain those systems with a nearby massive companion galaxy , since there we are further contaminated by tidal gas .",

    "narrow - band imaging is preferable for studying the nlr morphology , but reaches shallower limits than the spectroscopy .",
    "-0 mm integral - field observations allow one to study two - dimensional kinematics @xcite , but for local objects only cover the inner nlr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "( 2002 ) and schmitt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) measurements in fig . 2 for completeness , but note that the sizes can not be compared directly with those we measure here , because of the difference in depth .",

    "fraquelli et al .",
    "do not quote sizes but rather provide power - law fits to the surface brightness as a function of distance to the nucleus .",

    "we prefer the @xcite observations , since they are both sensitive and take into account photoionization by starlight .",
    "the measurements for our sample are summarized in figure  [ fig : sizes ] and table 2 , while the comparison samples are shown in figure  [ fig : sizes ] .",
    "the observed distribution of nlr gas depends on the geometry and luminosity of the ionizing source , the geometry and kinematics of the host ism ( e.g. , disk , spherical , outflow , or infall ) , and the density distribution of the gas .",
    "while most of these are likely related to the morphology and dynamical state of the galaxy , the geometry of the ionizing source is tied to the orientation of the agn . in the simplest model ,",
    "the galaxy ism is spherically distributed , while the ionizing radiation from the agn emerges anisotropically along lines of sight unaffected by the circumnuclear ` torus ' , as postulated by unified models of agn activity . in this case",
    "we expect to see ionization cones when the beam is not pointed directly at us , reflecting the geometry of circumnuclear obscuration .",
    "such cones are observed in images of nearby seyfert galaxies @xcite and more recently in the luminous obscured quasars studied here @xcite .",
    "-0 mm    in this simplest geometry , we would expect to find smaller sizes in unobscured sources , when looking closer to the axis of the ionization cones .",
    "the difference in distributions depends on the expected opening angle of the torus , with larger difference for smaller opening angles .",
    "recent observations of obscured quasars suggest that the space densities of obscured and unobscured sources are @xmath48 equal @xcite , leading to opening angles of @xmath49 , but even if significantly smaller opening angles are assumed , the expected differences in the median projected size between the two populations is small ( @xmath50 dex ) . at low redshift and ( thus ) lower luminosity , ionization cones are also observed in unobscured sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while round nlrs are observed in both types @xcite .",
    "presumably , the ism is not always spherically distributed or relaxed @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sizes]_a _ it appears that the nlr sizes of our obscured quasars are larger than the unobscured ones ( median difference 0.4 dex ) .",
    "however , this difference can be explained by differences in the depths of the observations , thus we can not address orientation differences in detail from these samples .",
    "it is interesting to note that at lower luminosities , @xcite do not see a significant size difference between the two populations . these observations , while shallow , are uniform between the obscured and unobscured populations .",
    "there has been some debate in the literature about the slope of a purported correlation between the nlr size and the agn luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some correlation is expected , given that the agn is photoionizing the nlr gas , but the form it takes may tell us something about covering factor or density as a function of luminosity .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : sizes](_a _ ) that generally larger nlrs are found in more luminous objects ( kendall s @xmath51 with probability @xmath52 that no correlation is present ) .",
    "it is also clear that there is substantial scatter ; we find an rms scatter of 0.3 dex in radius at fixed @xmath53}}$ ] .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations of ionization cones observed at random directions ( restricted to be outside the cones ) .",
    "they suggest that the orientation of the nlr axis relative to the line of sight is not a significant source of the observed scatter . at a fixed nlr size ,",
    "orientation effects introduce a scatter of @xmath54 dex within each ( obscured or unobscured ) subpopulation , even when a wide range of opening angles is allowed for .",
    "therefore , the observed scatter is likely due to the combination of the true variance in nlr sizes at a given luminosity and to the differences in the definition of nlr `` size '' .",
    "for instance , @xcite derive sizes that are factors of @xmath55 larger than those based on _ hst_narrow - band imaging because of their increased sensitivity .",
    "given that the nlr is not always spherically symmetric or smooth , defining a meaningful size that is insensitive to depth is a difficult problem .",

    "note that the correlation between agn continuum luminosity and @xmath53}}$ ]  in broad - line agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the nebulae are limited by the number of photons in the bright central regions of the galaxy , but that the situation changes in the diffuse outer parts .",
    "if so , we would expect size to scale as the square - root of luminosity at low luminosities and then flatten out to at high luminosities , modulo differences in host galaxies .",

    "these slopes correspond to density profiles with slopes ranging from 1.3 to 2.4 , in good agreement with the _ hst _",
    "observations of @xcite .",
    "one concern , as pointed out by @xcite , is that eventually the ionizing photons will run out of interstellar medium to ionize , particularly in the most luminous quasars .",

    ", we divide the sample by the bulge - to - total ratio ( b / t ) , and call galaxies with b / t@xmath68 disks ( sdss  j1106 + 0357 , sdss  j1222@xmath300007 , sdss  j1253@xmath300341 , and probably sdss  j1124 + 0456 ) , while the rest are bulge dominated .",
    "additionally , those with clear tidal signatures are `` disturbed '' ( sdss  j0841 + 0101 , sdss  j1222@xmath300007 , sdss  j1356 + 1026 , and sdss  j2212@xmath300944 ) .",
    "we would expect to see the signature of rotation most clearly in disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "we note once again that sdss  j1106 + 0357 and sdss j2126 + 0035 were observed along the major axis , sdss  j1222@xmath300007 was within @xmath69 of the major axis , and the remaining two galaxies were observed at a @xmath70 angle to the major axis .",
    "we would expect to see the signature of rotation in most of these galaxies .",
    "instead , we only see rotation in the case of sdss  j1106 + 0357 , sdss  j1124 + 0456 , sdss  j1142 + 1027 , and sdss  j2212@xmath300007 .",
    "although with such a wide range of position angles , and such a small sample , it is hard to say for sure , we find it suggestive that neither sdss  j1253@xmath300341 nor sdss j2126 + 0035 shows rotation .",
    "the sample galaxies showing rotation in their radial velocities also tend to show declines in @xmath71  by factors of two or more in the outer parts ( e.g. , sdss  j1124 + 0456 ) .",
    "in contrast , those galaxies with flat radial velocity curves ( the majority in this sample ) also have notably flat @xmath71  distributions at kpc scales .",
    "again , this is strongly in contrast to the kinematics in the stars , even in bulge - dominated systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more to the point , it is in contrast to the kinematics of warm gas in inactive late - type ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and early - type ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) spiral galaxies .",
    "in paper i we showed that @xmath71  in the nucleus is uncorrelated with @xmath72 .",
    "again , this behavior is in striking contrast not only to inactive galaxies but also to local , lower - luminosity active galaxies , for which it has been long been known that on average @xmath71/@xmath72@xmath73 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we are making a stronger statement . not only is the luminosity - weighted gas dispersion uncorrelated with the dispersion in the stars , but the dispersion in the gas stays high out to kpc scales in these galaxies .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "-0 mm this behavior is different from that seen in regular inactive galaxies .",
    "it is also different from that in local , well - observed seyfert galaxies .",

    "* ) . in such objects",
    ", the inner or classical nlr extends to a few hundred pc and has linewidths of @xmath74  km  s@xmath3 . at higher spatial resolution",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , at larger radius , the linewidths drop and the kinematics of the nlr gas simply reflect that of the bulge or disk in which the gas sits ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . clearly , the observed kinematics of gas in hosts of obscured quasars are quite dissimilar from this picture .",
    "many of the host galaxies of our obscured quasars have nearby companions and/or show signs of recent interactions .",
    "it is therefore possible that the gas is being stirred by gravitational interactions with nearby galaxies . to explore that possibility further",
    ", we examine the analogous inactive ultra - luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "the integral - field spectra of @xcite show that even in these ongoing mergers the gas kinematics traces that of the stars .",
    "the @xmath71  profile is typically seen to decline in the outer parts as in non - merging systems , again in contrast to our findings for hosts of obscured quasars .",
    "of course , there are exceptions in the colina et al .",
    "sample , where the gas velocity dispersions are very complex .",
    "on the other hand , the mergers are more advanced in general than in our sample . thus , while we can not rule out gravitational effects in all cases , it seems most likely that the nuclear activity is directly responsible for stirring up the gas .",
    "we now address whether there is evidence for bulk motions ( e.g. , large - scale outflows ) in the gas based on the kinematics .",
    "-0 mm      we have derived `` maximum '' red- and blueshifted velocities at @xmath65 of the line profile , relative to the systemic velocity of the stars .",
    "we examine the distribution of maximum velocities as a function of radius for the ensemble of spectra in figure [ fig : maxvel ] . while the emission extends to kpc scales for the majority of the targets , the gas velocities are not typically very high . the median maximum blue velocity at 8 kpc is @xmath75  km  s@xmath3  while towards the red it is @xmath76  km  s@xmath3 , where we quote errors in the mean .",
    "a few objects ( sdss j1253@xmath77 , sdss j1222@xmath67 ) have gas at velocities exceeding 500  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "we note that the effective radii of these galaxies , for which we have well - resolved imaging , range from @xmath78 to @xmath79 kpc , with a median of @xmath80 kpc .",
    "these velocities exceed the velocity dispersions of the galaxies , but they do not compare to the @xmath48 thousands of km  s@xmath3  outflow velocities seen by @xcite and postulated to be driven by recent agn activity .",
    "furthermore , they are not close to the escape velocity needed to actually unbind the gas .",
    "as we show in figure [ fig : o3maxvel ] , there is no evidence for a correlation between the nuclear @xmath53}}$ ]  luminosity and the maximum observed velocity ( kendall s @xmath81 with a probability @xmath82 of no correlation ) .",
    "-0 mm    we now quantitatively address whether any of the gas is approaching the escape velocity .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate an approximate escape velocity for each galaxy by assuming that the circular velocity scales with the velocity dispersion as @xmath83 . assuming the potential of an isothermal sphere , the escape velocity as a function of radius scales as : @xmath84^{0.5}.\\ ] ] although @xmath85 is unknown , the escape velocity depends only weakly on its value .",
    "thus we assume @xmath86  kpc in all cases .",
    "the escape velocities thus estimated range from 500 to 1000 km  s@xmath3  over the entire sample , but only vary by @xmath87 for an individual object over the range of radii that we probe .    with escape velocities in hand , we can now address what fraction of the line emission comes from gas that is moving at or above the escape velocity .",
    "we first ask whether there is gas exceeding the escape velocity at each radius . with the same definition of systemic velocity as above",
    ", we integrate the line emission that exceeds the escape velocity to either the red or blue side of the systemic velocity .",
    "we then normalize by the total flux at that radius .",
    "these fractions are plotted as a function of radius in figure [ fig : fracesc ] for the 5 objects in which at least @xmath88 of the gas is nominally escaping for at least one radial position . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we focus here on the blue - shifted gas .",
    "in addition to calculating the escaping fraction at a given radius , we can also calculate an overall escaping fraction .",
    "they range from @xmath89 with a median value of 2% .",
    "nominally only a small fraction of the nlr gas is moving out of the galaxy at or around the escape velocity .",
    "however , the projection effects may be severe , and especially so because in obscured objects the gas motions are expected to occur largely in the plane of the sky .",
    "therefore , our estimates are a lower limit on the actual escape fractions ( see  6 for details ) . furthermore ,",
    "as discussed further below , we have good reason to think that the medium is clumpy . depending on whether the outflowing component has the same clumping factor as the bound gas ,",
    "it is difficult to translate these observed fractions into mass fractions .",
    "in addition to the escaping fraction , we would like to know how much mass is involved in the outflow .",
    "the standard method of estimating the density of the emission line gas uses density diagnostics such as the ratio of [ ] @xmath90 or [ ] @xmath91 .",
    "neither of these is available in the magellan spectra , and with several hundred km  s@xmath3  velocities , the [ ]  doublet is blended enough to be difficult to measure .",
    "the continuum - subtracted sdss spectra that integrate all emission within the 3  fiber yield a measurement of the [ ] @xmath90 ratio for all but the highest redshifts . using the iraf task _",
    "temden _ , these can be translated into densities ranging from 250 - 500  @xmath92 , with a mean of 335  @xmath92 .",
    "these values are consistent with those commonly seen in spatially resolved observations of extended nlrs and used in mass estimations ( e.g. , @xcite and many others )",
    ". however , such measurements can be highly biased toward high densities in clumpy gas .",
    "specifically , the recombination line luminosity depends on density as @xmath93 , whereas mass goes like @xmath94 , so the mass of the gas , its density and degree of clumpiness and its line luminosity are related through @xmath95 here we used a recombination coefficient @xmath96  @xmath97  s@xmath3 appropriate for a 20,000k gas , and @xmath98 is the degree of clumpiness , which by definition is @xmath99 and can be substantially greater .",
    "we have adopted a higher temperature than typical based on the [ ] @xmath100/[]@xmath101 line ratio . in general , the ratio ranges from @xmath102 in the central regions to @xmath103 further out .",
    "these ratios correspond to @xmath104k , and thus we adopt a temperature representative of the outer regions",
    ".    the standard method of calculating the mass involved amounts to using this equation with @xmath105 and @xmath106 of a few @xmath107 @xmath92 , and produces an absolute minimum on the gas mass visible in the emission lines of a few @xmath108",
    ". however , such high densities are in direct conflict with our observations .",
    "for one thing , we see high [ ] /h@xmath41  ratios , and thus high ionization parameters , and presumably low densities , at large radius . also , the observed extended scattering regions in obscured quasars place an independent constraint on gas densities @xcite . scattered light flux is @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the density of scattering particles , electrons or dust . assuming purely electron scattering , _ hst_observations can be fit by density profiles that decline as @xmath111 and with density @xmath112 @xmath92 at a distance of about 3 kpc from the center ( figure [ fig : scatter ] ) .",
    "the scattering angle is not well known , but it introduces only about a factor of two uncertainty in this measurement .",
    "dust particles are even more efficient scatterers than electrons , so in the more realistic case of dust scattering , which is suggested by several lines of observational evidence @xcite , the implied mean density is constrained to be even smaller , @xmath113 @xmath92 .",
    "the uncertainties are larger in the case of dust scattering , because the density measurement is sensitive to the assumed gas - to - dust ratio and the scattering angle ( for this particular value , 90  and small magellanic cloud dust , @xcite ) , but nevertheless it is clear that the scattered light observations require much lower densities than those implied by [ ]  ratios .",
    "the two measurements can be reconciled if the gas is highly clumped , so that most of the luminosity is coming from high - density clumps , whereas the mass and the scattering cross - section are dominated by low - density gas .",
    "while a detailed modeling of all observables is beyond the scope of this paper , we use a toy model in which the mass of the emitting gas at each density is a power - law function of the density , with power - law index @xmath114 between @xmath115 and @xmath116 , to estimate the clumping factor . since the [ ]  line ratios",
    "are usually observed to be between the low - density and the high - density asymptotes , values of @xmath117 a few times the critical density are required ; we use @xmath118 @xmath92 . at the same time , for @xmath119 the minimal density is constrained to be @xmath120 by the scattering observations . with these constraints ,",
    "the clumping factor is @xmath121 for example , for @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xmath92 , for each @xmath124 erg  s@xmath3 of h@xmath41 emission , the mass of the emitting gas is @xmath125 .",
    "this estimate can only be considered very approximate , since the derived mass is quite sensitive to the specific assumptions about clumping ( for example , it varies by 2 dex as @xmath126 varies between 1 and 2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that the standard method of mass determination likely produces an underestimate of the true mass and that the scattering observations provide a valuable constraint on the physical conditions in the nlr .",
    "in short , we see compelling evidence that the nlr is clumpy . as a result ,",
    "it is difficult to estimate robust gas masses , and thus difficult to determine what fraction of the gas may be expelled by potential agn outflows .",
    "many recent surveys have identified potential dual active galaxies ( i.e. , two active galaxies with @xmath48 kpc separations ) as narrow - line objects with multiple velocity peaks in the [ ]  line in sdss spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as from the deep2 redshift survey @xcite .",
    "other candidates have been identified based on spatially offset nuclei @xcite .",
    "there are two intriguing objects in this sample that may contain dual agns .",
    "-0.5truein 0.1 in -0 mm the first is sdss j1356 + 1026 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bubbleim ] ) , which has two clear continuum sources , each with associated high - ionization [ ] emission .",
    "their separation is @xmath127 kpc ( 11 ) .",
    "this object was highlighted as a potential dual agn by both @xcite based on multiple velocity peaks in the sdss spectrum and by @xcite from keck ao imaging .",
    "we have recently shown that @xmath7 of the double - peaked narrow - line candidates also have spatially resolved dual continuum sources @xcite .",
    "it seems natural that two galaxies would contain two bhs . on the other hand ,",
    "there well may be a single radiating bh that is illuminating all of the surrounding gas .",
    "unfortunately , our long - slit spectra do not include [ ]  or [ ] , which would give us a handle on the electron densities , and thereby whether a single ionizing source is plausible .",
    "given the projected separation of 2.5 kpc , if we assume that there is a single ionizing source associated with one of the two continua , we would expect to see the ionization parameter decrease by a factor of @xmath128 between the two targets .",
    "in fact , the [ ] /h@xmath41  ratios are within @xmath88 of each other , as are the [ ]  fluxes . on the other hand",
    ", the very high ionization parameter seems to extend over the entire nebulosity ( @xmath6 kpc ) .",
    "of course , the accreting bh may sit between the two continuum sources .",
    "definitive proof requires the detection of x - ray or radio cores associated with each continuum source .",
    "sdss j0841 + 0101 shows much less ambiguous evidence for a pair of accreting bhs , with a projected separation of 38 ( 7.6 kpc ; fig .",
    "[ fig : binim ] ) . it would not be included in double - peaked samples assembled from the sdss because the separation on the sky between the two components is larger than the sdss 3  fibers .",
    "nevertheless , the component separations are comparable to those in the liu et al . sample .",
    "@xcite show that the double - peaked samples are probably dominated by single agns .",
    "these observations highlight that we are likewise missing dual agns with slightly larger separations .    as is apparent from figure [ fig : binspec ] , the two agns are strikingly similar in spectroscopic properties .",
    "the [ ] luminosities ( @xmath129 erg  s@xmath3 ) agree within @xmath130 dex , and the [ ] /h@xmath41  ratios ( @xmath6 ) agree within @xmath131 .",
    "the only clear difference is in the linewidths .",
    "the primary galaxy ( a ) has a @xmath132}$]@xmath133  km  s@xmath3 , while the companion agn ( b ) is narrower , with @xmath132}$]@xmath134  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this difference most likely reflects the fact that a , with a stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath135  km  s@xmath3  is more massive than b , with @xmath136  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "taken at face value , this difference in dispersions corresponds to a difference of a factor of nearly 10 in bh mass between the two galaxies .",
    "accordingly , if the [ ]  luminosity tracks the bolometric luminosity , then apparently b is accreting 10 times closer to its eddington limit than a.    alternatively , there may be only a single radiating black hole .",
    "if there is only one quasar  in galaxy a  then we consider two scenarios .",
    "the first is that the quasar in a is unobscured as seen from b , so that the galaxy b is photoionized by the central engine in a. if we assume that most of the nlr emission in a is produced at a distance @xmath137 kpc from the nucleus , then in order to preserve the ionization parameter ( as evidenced by the similar spectra of a and b ) , the difference in electron density between the two galaxies would have to be a factor of @xmath138 .",
    "while the dust particles in galaxy b may scatter quasar spectrum , this emission can not dominate the observed spectrum ( otherwise we would see a broad - line agn in source b ) .",
    "the resulting estimates of the emerging equivalent width of the emission lines suggest that this scenario is possible , but has to be quite tuned in order to fit observations .",
    "the second scenario is that galaxy b is located along the obscured direction , just like the observer , but scatters some of the a s [ ]  emission .",
    "however , in this scenario the ratio of [ oiii ] fluxes of b and a corresponds to the fraction of photons that b intercepts , @xmath139 , contrary to the observed similarity of fluxes . in conclusion",
    ", the picture of a single active black hole producing two objects with similar fluxes and ionization parameters appears unlikely .",
    "we are looking for direct signs of feedback in the two - dimensional spatial extents and kinematics of the nlrs of a sample of luminous obscured active galaxies .",
    "our conclusions are mixed . on the one hand , we see clear evidence that the agn is stirring up the galaxy ism . on the other hand , we do not see signs of galaxy - scale winds at high velocities .",
    "however , as we argue below , perhaps this is unsurprising .",
    "we see two distinct signatures of a luminous accreting bh on the ionized gas in these galaxies .",
    "the nlrs are much more extended at these high luminosities than in lower - luminosity seyfert galaxies .",
    "in fact , the agns are effectively photoionizing gas throughout the entire galaxy .",
    "this alone means that the agn is heating the ism on galaxy - wide scales .",
    "the impact of the agn is more directly seen in the kinematics .",
    "we see very few ordered radial velocity curves ; instead the velocity distributions are typically quite flat even at large radius .",
    "perhaps even more striking is that the gas velocity dispersions are high out to large radius .",
    "as we have argued , not only do inactive galaxies uniformly show a drop in gas ( and stellar ) velocity dispersion at large radius , but even in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies the gas velocity dispersions are observed to drop at large radius .",
    "we can not therefore attribute the gas stirring to gravitational effects such as mergers .",
    "it is most natural to implicate the accreting bh .    on the other hand ,",
    "overall the velocities we observe in the nlr gas are not very high ( a few hundred km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "taken at face value , our crude estimates suggest that very little of the ism is moving fast enough to escape the galaxy , although a clumpy nlr complicates our ability to estimate this fraction robustly . in only one case",
    "do we see the spectacular outflowing nebulosity one might imagine in thinking of agn feedback ( sdss  j1356 + 1026 ) .",
    "before we can rule out that any gas is unbound from these galaxies , however , we should consider the impact of projection effects , potential observational biases , and some theoretical expectations .",
    "our observations suggest that ionized gas is ubiquitous within the galaxy but rare at larger ( e.g. , 10 kpc ) scales .",
    "as explained above , the observed ratio of obscured to unobscured objects leads us to assume an ionization cone opening angle of @xmath140 .",
    "with such a large opening angle , we would expect our slit to intercept the nlr nearly all the time , as we observe . on the other hand ,",
    "we see extended gas on 10 kpc scales in only one case .",
    "furthermore , the _ hst _  continuum images show extended emission on these large scales , but with a much smaller opening angle of 20 - 60 .",
    "similarly , we have visually inspected the most luminous obscured agns from the reyes et al .",
    "sample with @xmath141 and found evidence for small opening angles from the broad - band images ( which have significant [ ]  light in the @xmath142 band ) .",
    "probably we are seeing the effects of surface brightness dimming at the outer reaches of the bicone .",
    "although the true opening angle is large ( 120 ) , only a much narrower inner cone can be observed at 10 kpc .",
    "taking the smaller opening angles , we expect to see extra - galactic extended gas only 20 - 40% of the time .",
    "that fraction is not inconsistent with the number of objects that we observe with emission line regions extending beyond their host galaxies .",
    "projection effects also preferentially bias us against detecting the true outflowing velocities . these are obscured objects , and on large scales we see evidence for ionization cones in the _ hst _  continuum imaging .",
    "we thus expect the largest accelerations to occur in the plane of the sky .",
    "we perform a monte carlo simulation in which the nlr is modeled as a biconical outflow with constant velocity as a function of radius , assuming different opening angles for the bicone ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velproject ] ) .",
    "we sample random lines of sight outside of the bicone , and find that while the intrinsic velocity is uniformly high , we only expect to observe high ( e.g. , approaching escape ) velocities a small fraction of the time .",
    "these simulations take into account only the bias introduced by projection effects and assume constant velocity and uniform emissivity within the bi - cone .",
    "we also considered more realistic models , in which velocity varies as a function of distance ( @xmath143 ) from the center , mass conservation is satisfied and the emissivity correspondingly declines as @xmath144 .",
    "due to the decline of emissivity in these models , at a projected distance @xmath145 from the center the observed brightness is dominated by the location physically closest to the center ( that is , @xmath146 ) , and this gas is moving exactly in the plane of the sky exacerbating the projection bias . in the case",
    "@xmath147 the emissivity may be uniform , but the integral along the line of sight is dominated by gas that moves slower than the gas at @xmath145 because of the declining velocity profile .",
    "therefore , in these more realistic situations we find a radial velocity distribution that is more peaked at zero than shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : velproject ] .",
    "thus , while we observe small escaping fractions , once projection effects are accounted for , the observations may be consistent with high velocities in a large fraction of the gas .",
    "finally , there is the possibility that the outflows operate predominantly on small scales . in local low - luminosity sources outflows",
    "are observed only within the inner hundreds of pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , recent simulations by @xcite suggest that bhs do self - regulate their own growth but do not generate galaxy - wide outflows .      of course",
    ", other factors may be at play as well .",
    "there is the possibility that some fraction of the ionizing photons have escaped the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even that we are seeing galaxies in some pre - outburst phase , as may be expected if obscured accretion tends to accompany the late stages of merging and star formation activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to compare with simulations of galaxy - scale outflows .",
    "we start with the work of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these simulations focus on smaller scales than those we probe , extending no further than 10 pc .",
    "however , it is at least a starting point for comparison .",
    "the simulations include radiative heating by both an accretion disk and an x - ray corona , and look at the impact of varying the density and temperature structure , as well as rotation , of the gas .",
    "we highlight a few generic conclusions from their studies that are very relevant to our work .",
    "first of all , the final flow includes both an equatorial inflow and a bipolar outflow .",
    "consistent with our work , the opening angle of the outflowing cone can be quite wide ( up to 160 ) . also interesting to note is that the outflows can be dynamic , clumpy as we observe , and with multiple temperatures ( ranging from the 10@xmath148 k gas observed here all the way to x - ray emitting temperatures ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the outflows on pc scales will propogate to larger ( galaxy - wide scales ) .    a recent study by hopkins et al .",
    "( in preparation ) of outflows driven by agns in numerical simulations demonstrates several surprising similarities to the kinematics of the ionized gas we see in our study .",
    "the observations suggest that outflows are clumpy because the measurements of rms density and the mean density are highly discrepant .",
    "the simulations suggest that outflows are clumpy because they are subject to rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "furthermore , the rate of the decline of mean density with distance from the center seen in scattering observations is similar to that seen in numerical simulations where the motion of the gas becomes ballistic at large distances .",
    "the masses and the velocities of the outflows that we find are quite similar to those seen in numerical simulations , and although the kinetic energies of the outflows ( @xmath149 erg  s@xmath3 ) are just a small fraction of the total energy output of the agn , the simulations suggest that the wind is in fact driven by a much stronger coupling of the agn output to the gas .",
    "the small kinetic energies that we see at this late ( @xmath150 years ) stage are simply left - overs after much of the energy was efficiently radiated by the outflow . while these qualitative similarities are very encouraging , the specific mechanism responsible for coupling of the black hole output to the gas on much smaller spatial scales ( which then develops into the relic outflow we see now ) remains unidentified .    in short ,",
    "it is clear that the presence of the agn at the galaxy center impacts the entire galaxy .",
    "whether significant mass outflows are driven , particularly in the radio - quiet regime considered here , remains an open question .",
    "the next step for this type of analysis is already underway .",
    "integral - field unit observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , particularly with a wider wavelength coverage , will remove some of the ambiguities we struggle with .",

    "<S> we find a slope of @xmath1 for the power - law relationship between size and luminosity , suggesting that the nebulae are limited by availability of gas to ionize at these luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we find that the active galactic nucleus is effectively ionizing the interstellar medium over the full extent of the host galaxy . broad ( @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 ) linewidths across the galaxies reveal that the gas is kinematically disturbed </S>",
    "<S> . furthermore , the rotation curves and velocity dispersions of the ionized gas remain constant out to large distances , in striking contrast to normal and starburst galaxies . </S>",
