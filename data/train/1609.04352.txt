    "a central issue concerning galaxy formation and evolution refers to environmental factors .",
    "it is well - established that the average properties of galaxies such as their mass , colours , morphologies , and gas content depend upon the environment where they reside .",
    "galaxies in clusters tend to be more massive and have lower star formation rates ( sfrs ) than isolated field galaxies which are , in general , actively star forming @xcite .",
    "it is also well - known that galaxy properties depend strongly on galaxy mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that galaxy mass and environment are correlated , since denser environments tend to be inhabited by more massive galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several physical processes are thought to be relevant in regulating star formation in dense environments by driving cold gas away from galaxies and by heating it up .",
    "some of these mechanisms are more effective in dense regions like rich clusters , whereas in groups of galaxies other mechanisms play the most important role .",
    "for example , galaxy interactions as mergers and harassment are favoured in group environment because of the low relative velocities between galaxies @xcite , while in high density environments galaxies can be strongly affected by mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping and strangulation due to the high temperature and pressure of the intra - cluster medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "coupled with these processes , massive galaxies tend to reduce their velocities through the energy equipartition by dynamical friction with less massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "a possible consequence of these environmental factors are the so - called segregation effects , that is , correlations between galaxy properties and/or radial trends of those properties as a function of the group / cluster centre .",
    "the presence of the segregation effect in galaxy clusters and groups has been studied by several authors .",
    "@xcite studying luminosity and morphological segregation in an ensemble of 59 rich nearby clusters , observed in the eso nearby cluster survey , found that luminosity segregation is evident only for elliptical galaxies brighter than @xmath11 = -22.0@xmath120.1 , and not located in substructures .",
    "@xcite analysed morphology and luminosity segregation of galaxies in loose groups identified in the nearby optical galaxy catalogue .",
    "they concluded that spatial segregation is stronger than kinematical segregation and that luminosity is independent of morphological segregation .",
    "they argued that segregation phenomena are mainly connected with the initial conditions at the time of galaxy formation and that the mechanisms which influence galaxy luminosity and morphology should act in a similar way in groups and in clusters .",
    "@xcite examined a sample selected from the 2df galaxy redshift survey to analyse the segregation effect in galaxy groups .",
    "they found that passively star forming galaxies show a statistically narrower velocity distribution than that of galaxies with a substantial star forming activity .",
    "they also found that the sample of red galaxies , with colour index b@xmath13r @xmath14 1 , have a larger fraction of small velocities ( @xmath151 ) compared with the blue galaxies .",
    "@xcite selected a sample of 335 clusters from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and found that bright cluster galaxies ( @xmath16 ) have significantly smaller velocity dispersion than fainter galaxies .",
    "they also pointed out that the results remain the same when the sample is splitted in star forming late type and passive late type galaxies , with the former having a larger velocity dispersion in comparison with the last .",
    "@xcite , using a sample of 57 groups selected from the 2df percolation - inferred galaxy group catalogue , found that galaxies brighter than @xmath11 = -21.5 show a decrease in normalized velocity dispersion , @xmath17 , while for the fainter ones the velocity dispersion is approximately constant .",
    "interestingly , the result remains for groups considered dynamically non - evolved , but with a steeper correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite , using the sdss group catalogue of @xcite , suggest that satellite galaxies become redder and more concentrated than central galaxies once they fall into a bigger halo .",
    "however , they do not find indication that the magnitude of the transformation depends on environment . also using sdss clusters",
    ", @xcite find no evidence for mass segregation in four redshift bins at @xmath18 .",
    "a similar result is found by @xcite using mass - limited samples at @xmath19 from the imacs cluster building survey and the eso distant cluster survey .",
    "recently , @xcite show that failure to find mass segregation is due to a mass completeness cut at intermediate to high stellar mass , or to take only high - mass haloes .",
    "@xcite also show that mass segregation is enhanced with the inclusion of low - mass galaxies , and decreases with increasing halo mass .",
    "currently , few studies are available regarding segregation phenomena at intermediate and high redshifts . for instance",
    ", @xcite find evidence for mass segregation in zcosmos groups at both @xmath20 and @xmath21 . by splitting up their sample into poor and rich groups at @xmath20",
    ", they find evidence for mass segregation in rich groups but not in poor groups .",
    "also , @xcite find evidence for mass segregation in the group environment evolution collaboration 2 ( geec2 ) for groups at @xmath22 , using a stellar mass - limited sample with @xmath23 . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite find evidence for velocity segregation in a collection of 41 galaxy clusters at @xmath24 .",
    "in the present work , we probe velocity and spatial segregation in low - mass galaxy groups , that is , the possibility of more luminous and redder galaxies being more central and move more slowly than fainter and bluer ones .",
    "our aim is to compare these segregation phenomena for well selected samples defined in two redshift intervals , at @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present a description of the data used , i.e , the deep2 survey and group catalogue , and the method used to define the group virial properties ; in section 3 we present the main results of velocity segregation in luminosity and morphological type ; in section 4 we discuss some possible systematics ; and finally in section 5 we discuss our results . throughout this work",

    "the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite is considered the largest spectroscopic survey of homogeneously selected galaxies at @xmath29 1 . the survey covers a total area of 2.8 deg@xmath30 distributed across four fields observed up to limiting magnitude r@xmath31 = 24.1 .",

    "this section gives a brief description of the deep2 group sample and for more details the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "groups were identified using the voronoi - delaunay method @xcite .",
    "the algorithm yielded 1165 groups with two or more members with accurate redshifts in the egs over the range 0 @xmath35 1.5 and 1295 groups at @xmath40 0.6 in the rest of deep2 . in additional to the coordinates and central redshift ,",
    "the group catalogue provides estimates of the total number of galaxies in the group and its velocity dispersion .",
    "however , we only consider the positional and redshift information , re - deriving the member list and group properties ( velocity dispersion , radius and mass ) .    to select group members and exclude interlopers we adopted the `` shifting gapper '' technique @xcite , using all galaxies with redshift quality 3 or 4 of the deep2 data release 4 ( dr4 ) .",
    "around each deep2 group we initially considered galaxies within a maximum radius of 4 mpc and velocity offset @xmath41  @xmath42  4000  km  s@xmath36 , where c is the speed of light , _ z _ and @xmath43 are galaxy and group redshifts , respectively .",
    "this large maximum radius is important to probe the effect of secondary infall on to groups .",

    "consequently ( a , b , c , d ) = ( -1.34 , -18.55 , -2.08 , -17.77 ) , we constructed a volume - limited sample for each color containing 835 galaxies in the range of @xmath55 and distributed over 105 galaxy groups .",

    "it is noteworthy that , since the deep2 groups contain only a few members , the group properties such as velocity dispersion , characteristic radius and mass were obtained considering the full member galaxies defined after interloper removal .",

    "the first point to note in this figure is the impressive increase of faint red galaxies from high-_z _ to low-_z _ , in the central parts ( 3% to 31% ) and also on the periphery ( 15% to 32% ) .",

    "* ) , in agreement with several studies reporting the existence of a deficit of galaxies at the faint end of the red sequence in high - redshift clusters @xcite . however , note that the total change in the faint blue sample was about @xmath119 , with a small decline within @xmath120 ( 50% to 42% ) , and a significant decrease for objects outside this radius ( 75% to 53% ) . at the same time , the total change in the faint red sample was of @xmath121 , a considerably higher variation .",
    "in addition , note in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] that the fraction of faint red galaxies is significantly higher in the periphery than in the central part for the high-_z _ sample , and that this fraction becomes similar to that of the central faint red galaxies in the low-_z _ sample .",
    "all this suggests we are not seeing just a downsizing effect , and might indicate an additional environmental quenching process driven by some mechanism favouring the appearance of faint red objects in the outskirts at @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , by defining a field sample at this redshift ( 3435 galaxies with @xmath122 and @xmath123 mpc away from deep2 groups ) , we find that the faint red fraction is @xmath82% in the field , similar to that we find in the inner parts of high-_z _ groups .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario where the decrease in star formation and color transformation sets in at several virial radii at @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "indeed , we note an important decrease of the faint blue population in the outskirts from high to low-_z _ ( 75% to 53% ) .",
    "this also suggests that quenching of star formation could begin to ocurr in the infall region with part of the red fraction in the central region at lower redshifts being due to the lag between the start of quenching and the time for its effects to become apparent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , after @xmath83 gyr , galaxies initially in the outer parts of high - z sample could have migrated , becoming part of the central regions of groups at lower redshifts . as shown by @xcite",
    "half of satellites in the mass range ( @xmath125 ) first fell into groups and clusters at @xmath126 , with a broad tail out to @xmath127 , so they typically have experienced @xmath128 4 gyr evolving as a satellite .",
    "these authors show results favouring a delayed - then - rapid quenching scenario , where satellite sfrs evolve unaffected for @xmath129 gyr after infall , and then star formation is quenched with an e - folding time of @xmath130 0.8 gyr . due to the long time delay before quenching starts , group preprocessing should play an important role in quenching satellites @xcite .",
    "@xcite put forward an alternative scenario whith an exponencial quenching timescale of 3@xmath133.5 gyr , for disc galaxies with @xmath131 .",
    "this scenario favours gentler quenching mechanisms such as slow  strangulation \" over more rapid ram - pressure stripping .",
    "this is also consistent with the work of @xcite arguing that in the local universe most galaxies were quenched over @xmath84 gyr timescales by strangulation .",
    "it is worth noting here that for a small subsample of our data ( 103 galaxies from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have @xmath132 , with mean stellar mass of @xmath133 , meaning that a slow quenching scenario could also be consistent with our results .    ) to low ( @xmath134 ) redshift samples , within the regions @xmath117 and @xmath118.,width=325,height=362 ]    still considering fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , we see the increase of bright red galaxies on the periphery from the high-_z _ to the low-_z _ sample .",
    "this increment may happen at the expense of minor merging of faint blue / red galaxies over the @xmath83 gyr timescale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also by secular quenching of bright blue galaxies .",
    "the slight increase of bright red galaxies in the central parts is lower than expected and could result from the fact that our low-_z _ sample has the brightest members less luminous than those in the high-_z _ sample ( see section 4 ) .",
    "note , however , that our central region extends up to 2@xmath59 , and hence contains a mixture of virialized , infalling and backsplash objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "taking galaxies only within 1@xmath59 , we find that the bright red fraction presents a larger increase , from 22% to 28% .",
    "to assess the impact of the sample size at low and high-_z _ on the results that we found , a two - sample test with permutation was applied .",
    "this test works as follows .",
    "first of all , the difference between the mean absolute magnitude for each sample , @xmath135 , is calculated .",
    "next , we combined the samples in a single dataset under the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the means that are being tested .",
    "then , we produced two samples , randomly selected , from the combined sample and a new estimate of @xmath135 is made .",
    "if the sample was drawn from the same parent distribution the difference between these two estimates of @xmath135 should be small .",
    "the process is repeated 1000 times and we check how many times the permuted difference is equal or more extreme than the observed difference . from the application of this test we found that the magnitude distribution of the subsample of galaxies in groups at low-_z _ used in this work is considered similar to the general low redshift sample of the deep2 survey at the 95% confidence level .",
    "another aspect to consider is the absolute magnitude range of the low and high redshift subsamples . the sample at @xmath78 is composed of 88 galaxies with @xmath136 distributed in 25 galaxy groups while the sample at @xmath79 contains 589 galaxies , with @xmath137 , spread in 75 groups .",
    "since both samples have the same low luminosity end , differences at low fluxes just reflect the automated binning procedure we adopt here .",
    "but the differences at the high luminosity end are real and should be taken into account .",
    "although we have bright galaxies in both samples , the high-_z _ sample have slightly brighter galaxies than low-_z _ sample .",
    "this is due to the natural trend of flux limited surveys .",
    "specifically , owing to the faint apparent magnitude range of z@xmath81 galaxies and consequently brighter @xmath54 at higher redshifts ( see @xcite to a detailed description ) the galaxies included by the deep2 survey tend to be brighter at higher _",
    "z_. besides that , as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( and exhaustively discussed on @xcite and @xcite ) red sequence galaxies in deep2 will have a brighter absolute magnitude limit than blue galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "however , a larger number of bright ( and massive ) galaxies in the sample would hardly be responsible ( alone ) for wiping out the segregation effect in the high redshift subsample .",
    "in this work , we searched for segregation phenomena in galaxy groups in the range of @xmath0 , using a sample of groups selected from the 4th data release of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey .",
    "the sample was divided into two stacked systems : low(@xmath2 ) and high ( @xmath3 ) redshift groups , with members being classified in red and blue objects .",
    "assuming that the color @xmath138 can be used as a useful proxy for the galaxy type , we found that the fraction of blue objects is higher in the high-_z _ sample , with blue objects being dominant at @xmath5 for both samples , and red objects being dominant at @xmath6 only for the low-_z _ sample .",
    "also , the radial variation of the red fraction indicates that there are more red objects with @xmath7 in the low-_z _ sample than in the high-_z _ sample .",
    "our analysis also indicates statistical evidence of kinematic segregation for the low-_z _ sample : redder and brighter galaxies present lower mean velocity dispersions than bluer and fainter ones .",
    "red and blue objects , however , present less separated mean groupcentric distance distributions , with the pairwise test indicating that the red population is more concentrade only at the 70% c.l .",
    "interestingly , the analysis of the high-_z _ sample reveals an opposite result : while red and blue galaxies have velocity dispersion distributions not statistically distinct , redder objects are significantly more concentrated than the bluer ones at the 95% c.l . from the mean difference in redshifts of the two samples , we estimate that the minimum timescale for the appearance of these inverted segregation effects is approximately 3.0@xmath120.3 gyr .",
    "the challenge , then , is envisioning how these results can emerge in the context of galaxy evolution .",
    "our main result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . to understand the difference at the bright end observed in this figure we should consider that in the low-_z _ sample the first bins are dominated by red objects , while blue galaxies dominate all the magnitude range in the high-_z _ sample ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the red galaxies in the low-_z _ sample show lower velocity dispersions ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) , in agreement with the works of e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for different samples of low redshifts cluster galaxies ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this suggests that brighter and redder objects are former inhabitants of the system , having experienced more environmental effects along time , and that have achieved the energy - equipartition status through dynamical interactions on a timescale of @xmath83 gyr since @xmath9 . the lower fraction of red / bright / low velocity objects in the high-_z _ sample explains the difference observed at the bright end in fig .  [ fig4 ] . still looking at this figure",
    ", we see a velocity upturn only observed in the last bins of the low-_z _ sample .",
    "this effect may indicate a fraction of faint blue galaxies which entered into @xmath139 before a significant quenching has happened .",
    "their higher velocity offsets would have acquired as they approach the group core , falling into the gravitational potential ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of similar objects in the high-_z _ sample suggests that infalling faint blue galaxies have not yet travelled a long journey across the group at @xmath9 .",
    "other important result we reported in section 3.3 is the reversing behaviour of red and blue galaxies with respect to velocity and groupcentric distances segregation , with redshift .",
    "regarding velocity segregation , the preceding paragraph provides a qualitative scenario .",
    "now , to explain the spatial segregation , we shoud notice that our analyses in sections 3.2 and 3.3 take account galaxies within @xmath139 .",
    "one can reasonably assume that such objects at lower redshifts correspond to a mixture of descendants of galaxies at higher redshifts in the same radii and of infalling objects from outer radii .",
    "thus , both survival and replenishment of galaxies should be expected over the time , and two important factors come into play : ( i ) the accretion rate of galaxies ; and ( ii ) the orbital dependence of galaxy properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , regarding velocity segregation ,",
    "it has also been interpreted as red and blue galaxies having different kinds of orbits , with the orbits of blue galaxies being more anisotropic than the red ones ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently , @xcite verified that the anisotropy profile of @xmath124 clusters is nearly isotropic near the cluster center , and increasingly elongated with radius .",
    "this result is consistent with a halo evolution through an initial phase of fast collapse and a subsequent slow phase of inside - out growth by accrection of field material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the accretion rate of galaxies from the field is higher at higher redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our sample at @xmath9 is expected to be more affected by recent infalls , which had less time to go deeper into the group potential .",
    "this could explain the development of a more marked difference between the mean groupcentric distance of red and blue galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "after @xmath83 gyr , part of these infalling galaxies may reach the @xmath140 region , at @xmath10 , mixing with virialized and backsplash objects , and thus presenting a less pronounced radial segregation between red and blue galaxies .",
    "our main achievements in this work are :    1 .   velocity segregation in the low-_z _ sample .",
    "we found a well pronounced relation between the normalized velocity dispersion , @xmath17 , and the absolute magnitude @xmath38 , where the brighter objects are moving more slowly than the less luminous ones .",
    "statistical tests reinforce our finding of lower velocity dispersions for redder and brighter galaxies at low redshifts at the 99% c.l .",
    "this result is related to the higher fraction of redder / brighter / lower velocity objects in the low-_z _ sample in comparison to the objects in the high-_z _ sample , where no velocity segregation was verified .",
    "2 .   strong spatial segregation in the high-_z _ sample , with red galaxies being more central .",
    "statistical tests indicate that red and blue galaxies are segregated with respect to the groupcentric distances at the 95% c.l . for galaxies in the low-_z",
    "_ sample there is a weaker evidence for spatial segregation between red and blue galaxies , only at the 70% c.l .",
    "this result is probably related to the different accretion rate of galaxies in groups at different redshfits , and the time needed to galaxies go deeper into the group potential and mix with other galaxy types .",
    "3 .   the timescale for velocity segregation emergence is @xmath83 gyr starting ( at least ) from @xmath9 .",
    "this seems to be the same timescale for significant infalling of objects from the outer radii in the high-_z _ sample to the inner radii in the low-_z _ sample .",
    "4 .   galaxy evolution in this same timescale is consistent with a slow star formation quenching scenario .",
    "our results are consistent with both pre - processing and slow strangulation processes",
    ".    future work will include complete stellar mass information , and then mass segregation and other aspects of the problem will be deeply investigated in the two samples .",
