    "there is a growing body of studies investigating the effect of the environment on the nuclear activity of galaxies and on the possible triggering mechanisms of the agn phenomenon ( e.g. , dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "1999 ; koulouridis et al . 2006 ; 2009 ; sorrentino et al .",
    "2006 ; gonzlez et al .",
    "2008 ; choi et al . 2009 ; silverman et al . 2009 ; lee et al . 2009 ; von der linden et al . 2009 ; padilla , lambas & gonzlez 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "one particular research direction is the study of x - ray agn , as a function of environment , since undoubtedly , one of the best agn identification methods is through x - ray observations .",
    "clusters of galaxies offer an ideal target for this type of study and indeed most x - ray based studies report overdensities of x - ray sources in clusters , with respect to the field ( e.g. , cappi et al .",
    "2001 ; molnar et al . 2002 ;",
    "delia et al . 2004 ; branchesi , et al . 2007 ;",
    "galametz et al .",
    "2009 ; gilmour et al . 2009 ) .",
    "there are attempts to substantiate such results with spectroscopic data and indeed various studies have verified the existence of a large population of x - ray agn in clusters of galaxies and its probable evolution with redshift ( eg . martini et al .",
    "2002 ; johnson et al .",
    "2003 ; martini et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; van breukelen et al . 2009 ) .",
    "some of the previous studies have also shown that only a small fraction of the x - ray sources , associated with clusters of galaxies , possess optical emission line ratios characteristic of agn ( see also davis et al .",
    "2003 , finoguenov et al .",
    "similarly , starting from optical spectroscopy , arnold et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that 14 out of 144 galaxy members of 11 clusters and groups are agn , but with only one being detected in x - rays .",
    "a similar trend of disconnection between x - ray and optically selected agn , in eight poor groups of galaxies , was also found by shen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "we believe that there is a major question still not adequately answered , which is : _ is there an enhancement of agn activity and/or of its x - ray manifestation in clusters of galaxies with respect to what expected from the obvious optical galaxy overdensity ? _ we attempt to address this question by searching not only for the existence or not of a cluster x - ray agn excess , with respect to the field , since such could possibly be expected on the basis of the known excess of optical galaxies in clusters , but rather by investigating whether the x - ray agn overdensity shows a relative enhancement or suppression with respect to the corresponding optical galaxy overdensity .",
    "the clusters of galaxies used in this study were selected according to the following criteria :    \\(a ) they belong to the list of abell clusters ( abell et al .",
    "1989 ) , to ensure a relatively large number of member galaxies ; ( b ) they have been observed by xmm - newton with an exposure time , in each of the three detectors , of more than 10 ksec .",
    "this is to ensure adequate photon - counts and to reach a relatively low flux - limit ; ( c ) the diffuse x - ray emission of the cluster , in the center of the field , is not as strong as to make impossible the detection of point sources located more than 0.5 @xmath8 mpc from the center , at worst ; ( d ) they lie in the area covered by the sdss , in order to facilitate the search of optical counterparts of the x - ray point sources .    when this study began in 2006 , 16 galaxy clusters with redshift 0.073 @xmath9 0.279 were found to meet the above conditions .",
    "our main aim was to calculate the density of x - ray sources in the clusters region and compare it with the corresponding density of optical galaxies .",
    "the cluster list , their redshift and various characteristics , determined in the present study , are shown in table 1 .",
    "the corresponding 16 xmm cluster fields were analyzed using the science analysis software ( sas ) of the xmm - newton .",
    "for the final extraction of sources we merged the images from all three detectors ( mos1 , mos2 and pn ) in the energy range 0.5 - 8 kev ( at the observers frame ) and selected the sources located within a radius of 1 @xmath8 mpc from the center of the cluster and 5@xmath10 above the background .",
    "we then extracted the flux of the detected sources , its corresponding x - ray luminosity at the redshift of the cluster assuming a power - law spectrum with @xmath11 and the sensitivity of the detectors in each pixel of our fields .",
    "since the sensitivity varies greatly across the field of view , mostly due to vignetting , we constructed the sensitivity map for each xmm field in order to eventually calculate accurately the theoretically expected number of sources in each region of interest .    due to the fact that the diffuse cluster x - ray emission can be strong enough to hide point sources ,",
    "we have excluded from our analysis the central region of each cluster .",
    "this was determined by adjusting a king s profile ( king et al .",
    "1962 ) to the diffuse emission , and deriving the cluster core radius , which is different for each cluster and ranges from @xmath12 20 to 170 @xmath3 kpc . in order to efficiently remove the influence of the diffuse emission of the central cluster area",
    ", we consistently used for all clusters an inner radial cutoff of 3@xmath13 .",
    "we however remind the reader that there are indications , from chandra data , of an increasing agn population towards the centers of clusters ( eg . , ruderman & ebeling 2005 ; martini et al . 2007 ; gilmour et al . 2009 ) , which we can not however efficiently probe with xmm - newton .",
    "we then counted all x - ray sources with luminosity @xmath1 erg / s ( @xmath14 ) located within the effective cluster region ( ie .",
    ", the annulus between @xmath15 and 1 @xmath3 mpc )",
    ". the corresponding expected number of x - ray agn ( @xmath16 ) , was estimated by using the @xmath17 of kim et al .",
    "( 2007 ) folding in the sensitivity map of each field .",
    "the overdensity of x - ray sources in each cluster was then calculated according to : @xmath18 and its uncertainty by using the small number poisson approximation ( eg .",
    "gehrels 1986 ) for a confidence level corresponding to the 1@xmath10 limit for gaussian statistics ( ie .",
    ", 0.8413 ) .",
    "the robustness of the derived values of @xmath19 to uncertainties ( a ) of the @xmath17 relation and ( b ) of the overdensity determination method , was verified by varying the @xmath17 relation within its quoted uncertainties and by alternatively using the overdensity estimation method ( their eq.6 ) of branchesi et al .",
    "no significant variations of @xmath19 and of its uncertainty were found .    to calculate the corresponding overdensity of sdss optical galaxies , and to minimize as much as possible projection effects , we extracted all galaxies located within 5 @xmath3 mpc around the cluster center ( to facilitate the estimate also of the local background ) , having magnitudes in the range @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath4-band magnitude corresponding to @xmath22 of the blanton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) luminosity function at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "this characteristic magnitude , corresponding to the break of the luminosity function , is estimated by : @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the luminosity distance of the cluster ( for the `` concordance '' cosmology ) , @xmath25 the k - correction for an elliptical galaxy sed ( based on poggianti 1997 ) and @xmath26 the galactic absorption , calculated using galactic absorption maps of schlegel et al . ( 1998 ) .",
    "we then counted the corresponding optical galaxies in the effective cluster area and compared with a global and/or a local background estimate , consistently for the corresponding magnitude range of each cluster .",
    "the former was determined from a 20 sq.degrees region near the equatorial coordinate equator , while the latter from the annulus between 4 to 5 @xmath3 mpc around each cluster center , a distance far enough to ensure negligible contamination by cluster galaxies .",
    "the overdensity results are robust to the different background estimates , with the only exception of a2065 , which appears to be embedded in an overall high large - scale overdensity .",
    "we choose to present optical overdensity results based on the global background estimate .",
    "finally , the overdensity of optical galaxies in clusters was calculated in the usual way , i.e. , @xmath27 , with corresponding poisson uncertainty of : @xmath28 $ ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the poisson uncertainty of the background optical galaxy density , with a typical value being @xmath31 .",
    "we find that there is a relatively significant x - ray source overdensity in about half of the clusters in our sample , the rest showing the excepted background value of @xmath19 .",
    "this can be realized by inspecting table 1 , where we list the x - ray and optical overdensity values and their uncertainties , as well as from figure 1 where we plot the cluster x - ray point - source overdensities versus the corresponding optical sdss galaxy overdensities , within the indicated @xmath4-band magnitude range .",
    "note that the 6 clusters with effective x - ray flux - limit corresponding to a minimum luminosity of @xmath32 erg s@xmath2 ( see specific values in table 1 ) , at the redshift of the clusters , are indicated by a triangular point type .",
    "although the number of clusters in our sample is quite low to provide stringent population statistics , a secure and important conclusion of our analysis is that the cluster x - ray point - source overdensities are always lower than the corresponding optical sdss overdensities ( with only two clusters having @xmath33 ) . in table 2",
    "we present such population statistics but separately for the two cluster subsamples having different limiting @xmath34 ( as discussed previously ) .",
    "note also that in order to take into account the variable uncertainty of the overdensity values we present in table 2 the poisson uncertainty - weighted mean optical and x - ray overdensities .",
    "a @xmath7-student test comparing the two means , assuming unknown and unequal variances , shows that they are different at a high significance level ( see @xmath35 in table 2 ) .",
    "inspecting table 2 it becomes evident that _ the luminous x - ray agn overdensity is suppressed by a factor of 3 - 4 , on the mean , with what would have been expected from a constant fraction , independent of environment , of x - ray agn to bright optical galaxies .",
    "_ this result is in the same direction with the optical sdss analysis of lee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in order to investigate in more detail the nature of the x - ray overdensities in our cluster sample",
    ", we have also cross - identified all detected x - ray sources with the sdss database , finding in total only six out of the 88 detected x - ray point - sources ( with @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 at the redshift of the cluster ) being clearly associated with the clusters ; among which one spectroscopically confirmed agn ( sy1 ) , 2 galaxies with no apparent emission lines and 3 more galaxies , based on their photometric redshifts ( one of which , in a1689 , is indeed confirmed by the spectroscopic analysis of martini et al .",
    "2007 ) . in table 1",
    "we also present the optical characterization of the x - ray point - sources , the total number of which for each cluster field , @xmath14 , is listed in column 5 .",
    "the 6@xmath36 column indicates the number of probable background qso , @xmath37 , ( mostly determined as such from their point - like images and their @xmath38 versus @xmath39 colors , while @xmath40 are also spectroscopically verified ) , the 7@xmath36 column indicates the number of x - ray sources clearly associated with cluster galaxies , @xmath41 , and the 8@xmath36 column indicates the number of apparently irrelevant associations , @xmath42 , like stars , foreground / background galaxies , no - counterparts , smudges , etc . about @xmath43 of all our agn candidates",
    "appear to be related to background qso , which in many clusters represent the expected background provided by the @xmath44 of kim et al .",
    "therefore , the real overdensity of x - ray agn associated with our cluster sample appears to be significantly smaller than what is listed in column 3 of table 1 , a fact which further strengthens our main result that the rich cluster environment ( within 1 @xmath3 mpc ) strongly suppresses the luminous x - ray agn activity .    in order to provide also a visual example of the source categorization , we present in figure 2 the xmm field of a2065 , the lowest @xmath45 cluster of our sample , together with the sdss composite @xmath46-band images of all the x - ray point - source counterparts .",
    "finally , we stress that the main conclusion of our present analysis is that in the intermediate intracluster distances ( ie .",
    ", between @xmath47 and 1@xmath3 mpc ) , the relatively dense and hot icm environment not only does not enhance agn activity , but it rather strongly suppresses it ( at least its x - ray luminous manifestation ) .     we would like to thank i.georgantopoulos for discussions and the referee for useful suggestions .",
