    "the satellite galaxies are populated via following steps : ( 1 ) obtain the mean number of satellite galaxies according to the integration of eq.([eq : phi_s ] ) with luminosities @xmath26 ; ( 2 ) use a possion distribution with the mean obtained in step ( 1 ) to obtain the number of satellite galaxies ; ( 3 ) assign a luminosity to each of these satellite galaxy according to eq.([eq : phi_s ] ) . note that satellite galaxies are allowed to be brighter than the central galaxy .",
    "however , we note that in our subsequent analysis , following the observational definition , the central galaxy is defined as the brightest galaxy in a halo .",
    "we refer to this set of mock galaxy catalog as ` clf1 ' .",
    "finally , in order to test if our analysis is cosmological dependent or not , we construct another set of mock galaxy catalog which we call as ` clf2 ' .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted for this set of mock galaxy catalog are those given by wmap3 : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath32 and @xmath63 .",

    "again , we use the halo catalog from the ` millennium run ' n - body simulation to construct the mock catalog .",
    "since the cosmology adopted in the millennium simulation is different from the wmap3 cosmology , we scale the halo masses in the millennium simulation to the wmap3 cosmology using abundance matching according to the mass functions of wmap3 cosmology and the millennium simulation .",
    "such abundance matching ignores the difference in the spatial correlations between halos in different cosmologies , but should be valid for our analysis which is based only on galaxy occupation in individual halos .    among the above four mock catalogs , although the sam has more ` physics ' in it , but does nt really fit the data ( e.g. , see weinmann et al .",
    "2006 ; liu et al . 2010 ; nurmi et al . 2013 ) , whereas the clf1 , clf2 and sham mocks are not based on physical models of galaxy formation but do fit the observational data . here in our subsequent probes ,",
    "we make use of clf1 as our fiducial sample , and take others mainly for comparisons .",
    "in order to carry out cosmological and structure formation investigations using observations of galaxy systems , one of the key steps is to obtain reliable estimations of the halo masses of the systems selected .",
    "the kinematics of member galaxies is one of the most commonly used methods to estimate masses of optically selected groups / clusters ( e.g. , van den bosch et al . 2004 ; kargert et al .",
    "2004 ; more et al .",
    "however , this method may be significantly affected by anisotropies of the velocity dispersion ( e.g. biviano et al , 2006 ; white et al .",
    "furthermore , for groups containing only a few members , or when only a few group members can be observed , the estimation of velocity dispersion becomes noisy , making the dynamical mass estimation unreliable .",
    "recently , another halo mass indicator has been used to estimate halo masses for galaxy systems over a large dynamical range .",
    "this method uses the richness or the characteristic group luminosity as the proxy of halo mass , and so can readily be applied once galaxy systems are selected from a redshift survey .",
    "richness is one of the easiest quantities of a galaxy system to observe , but there are different ways to define the richness .",
    "for instance , one can define it as the number of member galaxies within the red sequence or above a certain luminosity threshold .",
    "gladders & yee ( 2000 , 2005 ) used the red sequence richness to measure the mass of the halos from photometric data .",
    "the characteristic group luminosity ( or stellar mass ) , which is defined as the total group luminosity ( stellar mass ) of member galaxies above a certain luminosity threshold , is presumably a better mass indicator than the richness .",
    "this is especially the case for very poor galaxy systems dominated by a single luminous galaxy , where the galaxy luminosity is known to change as a function of halo mass over a large range .",
    "as demonstrated in yang et al .",
    "( 2005a ; 2007 ) using mock redshift surveys , the total luminosity of all member galaxies in a group is tightly correlated with halo mass .",
    "this method needs the determination of the total group luminosity .",
    "however , a limitation of this method is the need of corrections in real observations where only bright galaxies are observed .",
    "although one may make corrections using a luminosity function ( e.g. that for the total galaxy population ) , detailed clf modeling shows that the correction depends significantly on halo mass ( yang et al . 2003 ; van den bosch et al",
    ". 2007 ; yang et al . 2008 ) . to avoid this uncertainty and as a compromise with observational magnitude limit",
    ", one may use a characteristic group luminosity , defined as the total luminosity of member galaxies above a luminosity threshold .",
    "for instance , yang et al . ( 2005a ; 2007 ) used a characteristic group luminosity , @xmath2 , which is defined as the total luminosity of all group members brighter than @xmath65 for the 2dfgrs group catalogue , or of all group members brighter than @xmath3 for the sdss dr7 group catalogue , as the halo mass proxy .",
    "tests using mock galaxy and group catalogues show that the characteristic group luminosity is tightly correlated with the mass of the dark matter halo hosting the group ( yang et al .",
    "once the characteristic group luminosities of all the groups are obtained , one can assign groups with halo masses according to abundance matching ( e.g. mo , mao & white 1999 ) between the group luminosity function and the halo mass function predicted with a given cosmology ( see yang et al .",
    "2007 for details ) .",
    "[ fig : m - lg ] shows the relation between the characteristic group luminosity @xmath2 ( the total luminosity of all group members brighter than @xmath3 ) and the halo mass @xmath8 obtained directly from the clf1 , clf2 , sam and sham mock galaxy catalogs in different panels as indicated , respectively .",
    "the symbols in each panel are the median values while the error - bars are the 1-@xmath66 variation ( 68% confidence level ) .",
    "there is a clear tight correlation between the characteristic luminosity and the halo mass .",
    "the typical 1-@xmath66 variations in @xmath67 given by the sam sample are @xmath68 for massive halos and @xmath69 for intermediate mass ( @xmath70 ) halos .",
    "the corresponding variations given by the clf1 , clf2 and sham samples are @xmath71 for massive halos and @xmath72 in the intermediate mass range .",
    "note that , the very asymmetric error bars at low luminosity end for sam sample are caused by a combination of the color modeling of central galaxies in halos around @xmath73 ( see fig . 2 for such a feature for central galaxies ) , the luminosity cut at @xmath3 and a smaller bin size used here .          in the local universe",
    ", the characteristic group luminosities can be determined for groups down to a halo mass of @xmath74 with surveys like the 2dfgrs and the sdss . however",
    ", if one goes to higher redshift or uses much shallower observations ( e.g. 6dfgrs ) , where only a few brightest members a group can be observed , corrections for the missing members have to be made to obtain the characteristic group luminosity , making the method unreliable . on the other hand ,",
    "investigations with the clf model and observed group and cluster catalogues have shown that the luminosity of the central galaxy @xmath15 of a group is correlated with its halo mass @xmath8 ( e.g. , yang et al .",

    "interestingly , we also noticed that this improvement is not a monotonically growth with the number of member galaxies we concerned .",
    "when the number of member galaxies involved is larger than five , the amounts of improvement actually are quite limited and become negligible when using more than seven members .",
    "this feature is caused by the decomposition of our halo mass estimation method : the median @xmath18 relation together with a gap dependent correction .",
    "this decomposition has the advantage of shrinking the halo mass estimation error only in very poor groups . as we will show in the next section , for groups with more than five members , ` rank ' method still performs better given good survey condition .",

    "the dotted red line in each panel is given by the ` rank ' method using only two , three , five and seven brightest member galaxies .",
    "in general , the performance of the ` gap ' method is somewhat better when only a few ( less than five ) brightest member galaxies are considered . then , this advantage is gradually lost when involving more members . in the row",
    "only five member galaxies are considered , the performance of ` gap ' and corrected ` rank ' method is about the same .",
    "when the number of member galaxies reach to seven , the ` rank ' method tends to be slightly better especially for the sam sample .",
    "meanwhile , we could also see the impact of including different richness for each galaxy group on ` rank ' method is larger than ` gap ' method .",
    "thus , ` gap ' method would be a better option when only a few galaxy members can be obtained , especially for groups with members less than five .      in real observations , one can only observe galaxies brighter than the survey magnitude limit .",
    "this limiting magnitude in - turn allows us to have a complete observation of galaxies of given absolute magnitude to certain redshift . here",
    "we make use of clf1 mock sample to assess the performances of the ` rank ' and ` gap ' methods under different absolute magnitude cuts .",
    "note that , for ` gap ' method , there are several ways to calculate luminosity gap depending on which member galaxy are used . as we found in previous section that the ` gap ' method roughly reaches the best performance at 7th brightest member galaxy , therefore , in what follows , when we refer to ` gap ' method , we mean using the maximum available up to 7th member galaxies to estimate the halo masses .",
    "[ fig : mmagcut ] shows the comparisons between true halo masses directly obtained from the mock samples and the ones estimated using ` gap ' ( left panels ) and ` rank ' ( right panels ) methods , respectively .",
    "we chose the absolute magnitude cuts to be @xmath3 ( top ) and @xmath205 ( bottom ) . using galaxies brighter than these absolute magnitudes in a group",
    ", we estimate the halo masses of the groups according to their characteristic group luminosity and luminosity gap respectively . in general ,",
    "the performances of ` rank ' is slightly better than ` gap ' method , especially with a fainter absolute magnitude cut .",
    "once we go to brighter absolute magnitude cut , both the ` rank ' and ` gap ' methods have worse accuracy of halo mass estimation .",
    "the amount of variance between the true halo masses and the estimated ones increase by about 0.1 dex from @xmath3 to @xmath205 for both estimation methods .",
    "nevertheless , we see that the performance of ` gap ' method is approaching to that of the ` rank ' method . here , compare to results show in fig.[fig : comparemass ] , we do see that the systematic deviation in mass estimation disappears .    to reveal in more detail the impact of different magnitude cuts , we plot the comparison of @xmath66 for both ` rank ' and ` gap ' estimation methods in fig.[fig : msigma ] to much brighter absolute magnitude cuts : @xmath3 , -20.0 , -21.0 and -22.0 .",
    "these absolute magnitude cuts roughly correspond to redshift completeness limit @xmath4 , 0.103 , 0.157 , 0.22 in the sdss observation with apparent magnitude limit @xmath206 ( e.g. wang et al .",
    "the black lines in fig.[fig : msigma ] represent the results given by ` gap ' method , while red lines are given by rank method .",
    "apparently , missing faint member galaxies influences both methods .",
    "compare to ` gap ' method , ` rank ' method is more sensitive to the increasing of luminosity threshold . in @xmath3 panel , ` rank ' method has an obvious advantage over a wide halo mass range , while the situation is inverted at @xmath207 .",
    "these results may indicate that , for very high redshift or very shallow observations where the luminosity threshold is high , ` gap ' method may be a better option .",
    "in addition , the ` gap ' method is not suffered from the volume calculation which is required in the ` rank ' method , thus can be easily implemented to surveys with poor geometry and are flux limited .",

    "the central ( brightest ) galaxies in the dark matter halos have a rough scaling relation with the masses of the halos : brighter galaxies live in more massive halos .",

    ", we make use of four mock galaxy catalogues , one based on the sam , one based on the sham and the other two on the clf , to investigate the central - halo scaling relation and to find out a way that can significantly reduce its scatter . based on these four mock samples",
    ", we probed the impact of the luminosity gap , which is defined as the luminosity ratio between the brightest and other member galaxies in the same dark matter halo . in this paper , we take into account a maximum of nine member galaxies in the modeling .",
    "we find that the scatter in the central - host halo mass relation is luminosity gap dependent , which in turn can be used to reduce this intrinsic scatter .",
    "the main findings of this paper are as follows .    1 .",
    "we find that the median halo mass for a given central galaxy luminosity can be described by simple relation described by eq .",

    "[ eq : dm_func ] which is independent to the detailed galaxy formation models , and thus can be applied to any median halo mass - central galaxy luminosity ( @xmath104 ) relation to get better estimation of the halo masses .",
    "4 .   the correction factors can reduce the scatters in halo mass estimations in massive halos by about 50% to 70% depend on which member ( second or seventh ) galaxies are used .",
    "5 .   comparing this ` gap ' method with traditional ` rank ' method",
    ", we find that the former performs better for groups with less than five members , or in observations with very bright magnitude cut .",

    "<S> we set out to find the way that can improve the halo mass estimation for those galaxy systems with limited brightest member galaxies been observed . using four mock galaxy samples constructed from semi - analytical formation models , the subhalo abundance matching method and the conditional luminosity functions , respectively , we find that the luminosity gap between the brightest and the subsequent brightest member galaxies in a halo ( group ) can be used to significantly reduce the scatter in the halo mass estimation based on the luminosity of the brightest galaxy alone . </S>",
    "<S> tests show that these corrections can significantly reduce the scatter in the halo mass estimations by @xmath0 to @xmath1 in massive halos depending on which member galaxies are considered . comparing to the traditional ranking method , we find that this method works better for groups with less than five members , or in observations with very bright magnitude cut . </S>"
