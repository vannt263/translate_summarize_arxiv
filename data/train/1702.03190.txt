    "during the last two decades , the development of sophisticated experimental techniques allowed one to use ultracold atoms to create two new states of matter that can be manipulated with high precision : the bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite and the degenerate fermi gases ( dfgs )  @xcite . using the deep experimental background obtained with the investigations on bec and on dfg , efforts have been dedicated to achieving a similar degree of control in molecular gases . indeed , the production and manipulation of dense gases of cold and ultracold molecules constitute nowadays an active research field in atomic and molecular physics . in particular , starting from a gas of ultracold atoms , the photoassociation  @xcite , the magneto - association  @xcite and the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite , are among the usual techniques to create cold and ultracold molecules .",
    "these experimental techniques have been successfully applied to form different homonuclear and heteronuclear alkali diatomic molecules in the rovibrational ground state , such as c@xmath0  @xcite , lics  @xcite , krb  @xcite or rbcs  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a number of theoretical studies have guided and promoted many of the experimental achievements . among others",
    "theoretical studies , we refer the reader to refs.@xcite and references therein . for a review about science , technology and applications of cold and ultracold molecules ,",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all the aforementioned techniques to create molecular bound states are based on the external control of the interactions of atoms and molecules with electromagnetic fields . from a classical point of view , it is of particular interest to study how the mechanical forces exerted light on atoms and molecules perturb their motion .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear nature of these forces make these systems very appealing for classical studies because , by the external control of the strengths of the interactions , we have at hand the possibility to tune the system through different classical regimes .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that the use of classical mechanics to study microscopic systems is not new : over the last three decades , a plethora of studies related to the classical dynamics of atoms and molecules in external fields can be found in the literature .",
    "some examples of such as studies can be found in refs .",
    "furthermore , classical studies in microscopic systems have revealed themselves as a power tool to understand quantum mechanical results in many cases ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "here we use nonlinear dynamics to explore the feasibility of creating cold diatomic molecules by using a strong linearly polarized laser pulse .",
    "while the usual techniques to create cold and ultracold diatomic molecules require the use of several excited electronic states , we describe here how the nonlinear mechanical force exerted by a laser field on an initially unbounded pair of cold atoms in their ground electronic state can lead to the formation of a bounded dimer .",
    "more precisely , we focus on the influence of the laser field in the formation of rbcs molecules . besides the kinetic terms , the rovibrational hamiltonian of the system includes two fundamental terms : namely , the potential energy curve between the rb and cs atoms and the interaction between the molecular polarizability and the laser field .",
    "because the laser pulse contains an envelope with ramp - up , plateau and ramp - down , the system depends explicitly on time and the corresponding hamiltonian has 3 + 1@xmath12 degrees of freedom .",
    "however , by using spherical coordinates , the number of degrees of freedom can be reduced to 2 + 1@xmath12 . for a convenient ensemble of initial conditions ,",
    "we compute the formation probability as a function of the laser field strength , for different values of the parameters of the pulse . in all cases",
    "we find that , as the field strength increases from zero , the formation probability first increases before reaching a maximum , and then decreases for larger values of the field strength .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar behavior has been found in the ionization probability of atoms in the presence of an intense laser field  @xcite . from a detailed exploration of the dynamics of the system after the ramp - up ,",
    "plateau and ramp - down sequences of the laser pulse , we infer that the study of the formation mechanism can be reduced to the investigation of the long - range interaction between the two atoms .",
    "indeed , we show that the formation is due to a very small change in the radial momentum of the dimer induced by the laser pulse .",
    "these observations allow us to build a simplified one - dimensional hamiltonian where only the long range terms of the potential energy curve and the molecular polarizabilities are taken into account . from this simplified hamiltonian",
    ", we obtain an analytic approximate expression for the formation probability as a function of the laser intensity .",
    "this analytic expression mimics very accurately the described behavior of the formation probability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the main ingredients of the hamiltonian of the system . in sec .",
    "iii we compute the formation probability as a function of the laser field strength . in order to get some insights into the behavior of the formation probability",
    ", we study the particular role played by the ramp - up , the plateau and the ramp - down of the laser pulse .",
    "the results of sec .",
    "iii allow us to define in sec .",
    "iv a one - dimensional version of the full hamiltonian which captures the main characteristics of the system . in sec .",
    "v we define the simplified hamiltonian with only the long - range terms of the potential energy curve and the molecular polarizabilities .",
    "we show that this asymptotic hamiltonian is sufficient to describe the behavior of the formation probability .",
    "furthermore , we construct an analytic expression for the formation probability which includes the parameters of the laser pulse and the long - range parameters of the potential energy curve and the molecular polarizabilities .",
    "within the born - oppenheimer approximation , we describe the dynamics of the rbcs molecule in its @xmath2 electronic ground state in the presence of a strong linearly polarized laser field . the electric field of the laser is assumed to propagate in the parallel direction of the @xmath3-axis of an inertial reference frame with the origin at the center of mass of the nuclei . for a nonresonant laser field ,",

    "indeed , as we can observe in fig.[fi : potencial ] , for @xmath52 a.u . , the energy surface @xmath11 presents four critical points : two equivalent minima @xmath53 at @xmath54 respectively , a saddle point @xmath55 at @xmath56 and a maximum @xmath57 at @xmath56 .",

    "in other words , we find the expected behavior of a dimer aligned in the @xmath54 directions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when the energy of the system is above the saddle point energy , the molecule can describe complete rotations . due to the  energy hill \" around the maximum @xmath57 created by the polarizability",
