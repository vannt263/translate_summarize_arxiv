    "other early estimates of the disruption rate are due to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in the last of these a binary of age @xmath7 and component masses @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 was estimated to have a 50% survival probability at semi - major axis @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the mean - square relative velocity between the center of mass of the binary and the perturbing stars , and @xmath12 is the second moment over mass of the number density of stars in the solar neighborhood ( cf .",
    "eq.[massdensity ] ) .",
    "this estimate is substantially shorter than pik s , mostly because it includes the cumulative effects of distant , weak encounters ( which pik recognized to be important but did not compute ) .",
    "a closely related problem is to estimate the distribution of semi - major axes of wide binaries .",
    "for relatively small semi - major axes @xmath13 the distribution is presumably primordial , and thus reflects the ( poorly understood ) formation process of wide binaries . at larger semi - major axes @xmath14",
    "the distribution ought to be primarily determined by the disruption process .",
    "the fokker ",
    "planck equation that describes the evolution of the semi - major axis distribution ( eq.[diffcbs ] ) was derived and solved by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who showed that @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "observationally , the distribution of wide binary semi - major axes is determined by measuring the projected separations of common - proper - motion binaries ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein ) . for @xmath17 the distribution of separations or semi - major axes , with other orbital elements assigned as described at the start of  [ simulation ] ,",
    "the median projected separation is @xmath18 .",
    "thus we may assume that the distributions of semi - major axes and separations are nearly the same .",
    "] of disk binaries is approximated well by pik s ( 1924 ) law , @xmath19 at larger semi - major axes , the number of binaries falls more steeply , roughly as @xmath20 for @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the further steepening to @xmath22 that is expected for @xmath23 is much more difficult to detect .",
    "there have been a number of claimed detections of this steepening  often , less accurately , called a `` cutoff''but these are controversial @xcite",
    ". measurements of the semi - major axis distribution are likely to improve dramatically in the next few years because of large , accurate proper - motion surveys .",
    "in particular , the gaia spacecraft will determine both proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes for millions of nearby stars with unprecedented accuracy , allowing a far better determination of the binary population at large separations than the ground - based proper motions and photometric parallaxes that have been used in all studies so far .",
    "large , well - characterized samples of wide binaries have many applications @xcite .",
    "in particular , the distribution of wide binary semi - major axes can be used to constrain the properties of molecular clouds and other massive structures in the disk , and possible compact objects ( machos ) in the dark halo @xcite .",
    "if the distribution of binaries can be measured at separations as large as a few parsecs we expect to see `` tidal tails '' of the kind that have been detected around globular clusters @xcite ; the evolution of these structures offers a prototype for the evolution of the phase - space structures in the solar neighborhood caused by the disruption of stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "almost all theoretical studies of the expected distribution of wide binaries have made two related approximations that compromise their validity at the largest semi - major axes :    * the stars are assumed to disappear instantaneously as soon as their orbits become unbound .",
    "this is unrealistic because the disruption rate is dominated by weak , distant encounters , so most escaping stars have very small relative velocity and only drift slowly apart . * the galactic tidal field",
    "is ignored .",
    "the tidal field becomes stronger than the gravitational attraction between the stars in the binary when the separation is roughly the jacobi or tidal radius , which equals @xmath24 for solar - mass stars in the solar neighborhood ( eq . [ eq : rjacdef ] ) .",
    "thus the tidal field is already significant at the separations ( @xmath25 ) probed by current measurements of the wide binary distribution , and dominates the dynamics at larger separations .",
    "including these two effects is necessary if we are to understand the expected distribution of binary stars  bound and unbound  at semi - major axes of @xmath26 and larger . to achieve",
    "this understanding is the primary goal of this paper .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the evolution of disk binaries under the influence of passing stars , although it is straightforward to extend our methods to include either halo binaries or other perturbers such as molecular clouds or massive black holes .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : basic ] , we describe the basic equations of motion for binary stars in the galactic tidal field and how we calculate the perturbations from other stars that drive the orbital evolution .",
    "we also review the standard analytic treatment of the evolution of bound binaries using a diffusion equation .",
    "then in  [ simulation ] we describe the results from our simulations .",
    "finally ,  [ sec : disc ] contains a discussion and conclusions , and appendix [ diffebs ] derives an analytic model that approximately describes the diffusion of unbound binary stars .",
    "in this section , we describe the details of our numerical simulation .",
    "first , we give the equations of motion of the binary star in hill s approximation .",
    "then , we describe how we include the effects of kicks from other stars .",
    "finally , we describe the diffusion approximation , which should be valid for binaries with small semi - major axes .",
    "we use hill s approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to describe the motion of the binary star in the galaxy .",
    "hill s approximation is valid because the mass of the binary is much less than the mass of the galaxy ( by a factor @xmath27 ) .",
    "let the masses of the two stars in the binary be @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the potential of the galaxy is symmetric about the plane @xmath28 , where @xmath29 or @xmath30 is an inertial cartesian or cylindrical coordinate system with origin at the center of the galaxy .",
    "we introduce a second coordinate system @xmath31 with origin in the @xmath28 plane at distance @xmath32 from the galactic center .",

    "moreover the qualitative effects of molecular clouds may be different because the impact parameter of the most important cloud encounters is much larger than the binary s jacobi radius , whereas the most important stellar encounters have impact parameters smaller than the jacobi radius .",
    "molecular clouds have a much smaller scale height than old stars , so the effects of passing clouds and stars may be disentangled observationally by examining variations in the binary distribution with the vertical amplitude of the center - of - mass motion of the binaries @xcite .",
    "the use of the central limit theorem to model stellar kicks as a gaussian distribution ( eq .  [ distribution ] ) is a plausible first approximation but should eventually be replaced by a monte carlo model of the kicks from individual passing stars . as described in the discussion following equation ( [ eq : follw ] ) the assumption that there are many kicks per interval @xmath122 is not correct at small semi - major axes .",
    "also , for orbits near the critical jacobi constant @xmath255 there may be chaotic phenomena such as resonance sticking that can only be modeled using the actual distribution of velocity kicks @xcite . despite these concerns ,",
    "the tests we have carried out in  [ valuesofparameters ] suggest that our results are not sensitive to the specific value of @xmath122 .",
    "the distinction between evolution due to the galactic tidal field (  [ sec : nokick ] ) and evolution due to impulsive kicks (  [ kick ] ) is artificial , since the same stars in the disk contribute both the tidal field ( apart from a contribution from dark matter ) and the kicks ( apart from a contribution from molecular clouds ) .",
    "the approximation that there is a static tidal field can be misleading on timescales less than the collision time ( [ eq : tcolldef ] ) ; however , we do not believe that this approximation has biased our results significantly . see @xcite and @xcite for further discussions of this issue .",
    "there is a large literature on tidal tails from star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these differ from the binary - star tails discussed here in several ways .",
    "most obviously , clusters contain many stars so the structure of the tail from a single cluster can be mapped in great detail ; in contrast , the tail from a single binary contains only two stars so we must combine many binaries to measure the tail properties .",
    "a second difference is that the kicks to the orbits of stars in a cluster arise from other cluster stars , and therefore cease once the star escapes from the cluster , whereas the kicks to a binary arise from passing stars and continue after disruption .",
    "the most important consequence of this difference is that the length of a cluster tidal tail grows @xmath312 , while a binary - star tail grows @xmath313 .",
    "our results hold only for disk binary stars but it is straightforward to repeat the calculation for halo binaries .",
    "these are of particular interest because the semi - major axis distribution of halo binaries can be used to constrain the mass distribution of compact objects in the dark halo @xcite .",
    "we thank dan fabrycky , mario juri , and yue shen for helpful discussions .",
    "we also thank the referee , winston sweatman , for comments that significantly improved the paper .",
    "this research was supported in part by nasa grant nnx08ah83 g , and used computational facilities supported by nsf grant ast-0216105 .",
    "here we give an approximate analytic treatment of our results , by solving for the evolution of binary stars with @xmath314 and @xmath315 separately , then matching the two solutions at @xmath0 .",
    "the behavior of binary stars with separation much smaller than @xmath0 can be described by the diffusion approximation given in  [ diffusion ] .",
    "the probability @xmath316 for the binary stars to escape in the time interval @xmath317 is ( derivative of eq .",
    "b19 in @xcite , or from eq.[escapetime ] as @xmath318 ) @xmath319    after the stars have escaped to @xmath286 , the gravitational force between the two stars is much smaller than the galactic tidal force .",
    "then the relative motion in the absence of kicks is described by equations ( [ solutionrela ] ) with the right side set to zero .",
    "moreover their separations are dominated by drift along the azimuthal or @xmath34 direction , as seen from figure [ space ] , so @xmath320 . as the amplitude of the epicycle motion is small compared to @xmath34",
    ", we have @xmath321 , where @xmath322 is the position of the guiding center of the relative motion ( cf .  the analogous equations [ solutioncm ] for the motion of the center of mass ) .",
