    "the linear propagation of light at frequency @xmath1 in the @xmath2-direction in a mcf can be described by the coupled amplitude equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the complex amplitude of light in each of the @xmath5 cores .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath6 can be written @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the propagation constant in the @xmath9 core and @xmath10 is the coupling strength between the @xmath9 and @xmath11 cores . in general",
    "the propagation constants and couplings are strong functions of frequency , however we will be considering only narrow wavelength ranges at any one time and therefore the frequency dependence of @xmath6 has been omitted for notational convenience . the propagation constant in the @xmath9 core is defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the effective refractive index in the @xmath9 core . the coupling strength @xmath14 is defined as the overlap of the unperturbed mode profiles of the @xmath9 and @xmath11 cores , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , with the perturbation introduced by the refractive index contrast of the @xmath11 core : @xmath17 \\ , \\bar{\\psi}_i(\\omega , x , y ) \\ , \\bar{\\psi}_j(\\omega , x , y ) .",
    "\\label{eq : general_coupling}\\ ] ] here the unperturbed mode profiles obey the normalization condition @xmath18 .",
    "we model mcf as a nominally regular array of circular cores with step - index refractive index profiles , in which the mode profiles are bessel functions with exponentially - decaying wings . due to the exponential decay of the mode profiles , the dynamics of these structures",
    "are dominated by nearest - neighbour couplings .",
    "non - nearest - neighbour couplings can be ignored to an excellent approximation and we will adopt this convention henceforth .    for a given wavelength , @xmath6 describes everything that we require to describe light propagation through the mcf .",
    "given sufficiently accurate knowledge of the mcf structure we could straightforwardly calculate the propagation constants and mode coupling parameters for the fibre .",
    "this would allow us to solve the propagation equation [ eq : propagation ] , either through finding the matrix exponential of @xmath6 or by a stepwise numerical method , and hence determine the output amplitudes for any number of fibre cores .",
    "however , direct measurement of the structure does not provide sufficient accuracy to determine the values of propagation constant and coupling strength .    in a perfect mcf",
    ", all the fibre cores would be identical , with radius @xmath19 , centre - to - centre separation @xmath20 and index contrast with respect to the surrounding cladding material of @xmath21 . in this ideal situation the propagation constants for each core and the nearest - neighbour coupling strengths would be identical .",
    "light coupling between two cores within the mcf would be perfectly phasematched , and , if light was input to just one core , it would spread symmetrically and eventually re - assemble in phase in the conjugate core after reflecting from the mcf boundaries .",
    "any mcf that we might fabricate will not be ideal ; the structure will inevitably contain some level of variation .",
    "in general this could be either in the longitudinal or transverse direction , corresponding respectively to the @xmath9 core varying along its length ( @xmath22 ) or the propagation constants and coupling strengths varying from core to core ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; note however that for physically realistic systems we always require that the coupling is reciprocal so that @xmath10 and so on ) @xcite .",
    "variations in propagation constant and coupling strength both have the potential to influence the amplitude of light in each core at the output .",
    "local increases in coupling strength create `` preferred '' routes along which the light spreads , whereas differences in propagation constant imperfect phasematching between cores resulting in incomplete transfer of light from one core to the next .",
    "although it may seem at first glance that the latter effect is somewhat secondary , in fact  as we will see  it typically dominates the output intensity distributions .",
    "we can calculate the relative impact of these effects on the flow of light between the cores by considering the analogous case of a two - mode coupler ( equivalent to the simplest mcf containing only two cores ) .",
    "following the analysis in @xcite , the coupling strength between a pair of identical step - index cores , reduces to @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the usual core , waveguide , and cladding parameters also defined in @xcite , @xmath29 are modified bessel functions of the second kind , and the other symbols have the meanings previously defined in the text .",
    "the beat length between the two cores is defined as @xmath30 .",
    "the propagation constants and the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for the unperturbed individual cores are found by solving numerically the eigenvalue equation in the normal manner .",
    "note that the dependence of the coupling strength on both @xmath20 and @xmath19 is to a good approximation exponential when the cores are well - separated ( @xmath31 ) but the dependence on @xmath19 becomes less straightforward as the cores are brought into closer proximity due to the dependence on @xmath19 of many of the parameters in eq [ eq:2-core_coupling ] .",
    "the relative impact of variations in @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be found by examining the response of the two - mode coupler to changes core radii . @xmath32 and @xmath34 are plotted for a range of core radii in figure [ fig : two_core ] . for parameters similar to those of the fabricated fibre presented later in this work ( @xmath35 m , @xmath36 m , @xmath37 = 0.02 ) , we see that a change in core radius of 1% yields a fractional change in propagation constant @xmath38 and a fractional change in coupling strength of @xmath39 .",
    "we then solve equation [ eq : propagation ] for three situations : two identical cores of nominal radius @xmath40 with coupling @xmath41 and propagation constants @xmath42 ; two identical cores of radius @xmath43 with identical propagation constants @xmath44 but reduced coupling strength @xmath45 ; and two slightly different cores of radii @xmath40 and @xmath43 with different propagation constants @xmath42 and @xmath44 but coupling @xmath41 .",
    "for each system we input light to one core only and calculate the fraction that couples into the other after a fixed propagation length .",
    "the results of this are shown in figure [ fig : two_core ] .",
    "it can be seen that in the parameter range of interest , the change in output intensity is dominated by the differences in propagation constant rather than those in the coupling strength .",
    "we would like to find the variations in propagation constant and coupling strength in mcf that result from small structural fluctuations introduced during the fabrication process . to do",
    "so we make the following assumptions : each core can be individually addressed at the input end of the mcf ; the intensity of light exiting each core of the mcf can be measured ; deviations of the output intensity pattern from the ideal are dominated by differences in propagation constant rather than coupling strength ( i.e. all nearest - neighbour coupling strengths are assumed equal ) ; non - nearest - neighbour couplings are zero ; the mcf is sufficiently short that the fibre length is less than the beat length and the fibre properties can be considered constant in the longitudinal direction ( i.e. transverse core - to - core variations dominate ) ; and each core is single - moded over the wavelength range of interest . hence to describe propagation in a mcf with @xmath5 cores we need to find a single nearest - neighbour coupling strength @xmath33 and @xmath5 values of @xmath8 . by addressing each core individually",
    "we construct a set of @xmath5 normalised input intensity patterns @xmath46 , @xmath47 with related input amplitudes @xmath48 , each of which has @xmath5 elements containing a single nonzero entry equal to unity .",
    "these states propagate through a length @xmath49 of mcf according to equation [ eq : propagation ] and form a corresponding set of @xmath5 output states @xmath50 , for which we can measure the power exiting each core to yield @xmath5 output intensity patterns @xmath51 with elements @xmath52 .",
    "we need to find the @xmath6 that relates @xmath46 to @xmath51 .",
    "due to the phase insensitivity of our measurement , the correspondence between any individual pair of input intensity @xmath53 and output intensity @xmath54 is insufficient to define @xmath6 uniquely .",
    "fortunately , the additional information gained from measuring the output intensities related to all @xmath5 input states provides sufficient constraints to determine all @xmath5 values of @xmath8 contained in @xmath6 , however it results in a set of simultaneous equations that can not be solved analytically .",
    "furthermore the problem of minimising the difference between the input and output intensities is not generally convex in each individual @xmath8 ; local minima often do not correspond to the global minimum .",
    "hence to reconstruct @xmath6 we have implemented an iterative monte carlo method known as simulated annealing that is typically applied to multi - parameter optimization problems in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "we know @xmath46 and @xmath51 for a mcf with unknown transfer matrix @xmath6 .",
    "we can approximate the mean nearest - neighbour coupling strength @xmath55 and mean propagation constant @xmath42 of the mcf cores from our imperfect knowledge of the average mcf structure .",
    "we construct a transfer matrix @xmath56 that contains @xmath55 and a set of randomly - selected @xmath57 that vary around @xmath42 .",
    "the input states are propagated subject to @xmath56 using equation [ eq : propagation ] to yield a set of output intensities @xmath58 .",
    "the difference between the calculated output intensities and the measured output intensities is then found using @xmath59 this provides a normalised figure of merit that expresses per input state how much power on average ends up in the `` wrong '' core at the output .",
    "we then implement a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) routine with acceptance criteria inspired by the metropolis algorithm to reconstruct the differences in the propagation constants @xcite .",
    "we randomly perturb the @xmath57 and repeat the propagation ; if @xmath60 decreases the new @xmath57 are accepted .",
    "however , even if @xmath60 increases the move can still be accepted with a small probability to encourage the solution not to become stuck in local minima .",
    "the probability of accepting a poor move is exponentially dependent on a `` temperature '' function , @xmath61 , that decreases with the number of iterations @xmath62 , and the difference in the figure of merit between the current position and the new position , @xmath63 : @xmath64 @xmath65 is a constant and @xmath66 is an integer that increments on every iteration for which the solution is stationary .",
    "we choose a temperature function that decreases exponentially with iteration number : @xmath67}\\right ) , \\label{eq : temperature}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constants , and @xmath70 is the total number of iterations .",
    "the mcmc routine is repeated for @xmath70 iterations during which the magnitude of the random perturbations in @xmath57 is reduced in proportion to the values of @xmath61 and @xmath60 .",
    "the constants @xmath71 are set to obtain optimum performance .",
    "after the algorithm has finished , we are left with a set of reconstructed @xmath72 .",
    "note that , although the output intensity patterns give us information about the relative phase of light that has propagated through each core , there is no sensitivity to global phase .",
    "therefore , the reconstruction can not give any indication of the absolute magnitude of the mean value of @xmath72 , only the differences between the individual @xmath73 .",
    "hence we rescale the @xmath72 to have a mean value equal to @xmath42 ; these then represent our best estimate of the propagation constants in the @xmath5 cores .",
    "we also obtain a figure of merit for the fit , the residual value of @xmath74 , and the reconstruction can be repeated to find the value of the coupling constant , @xmath75 , that yields the smallest residual value .",
    "to test the performance of our algorithm we reconstructed fictional mcfs .",
    "we defined a set of target propagation constants @xmath76 containing both random and systematic variations over a range @xmath77 and found the associated output intensities @xmath78 assuming a uniform coupling strength @xmath79 in equation [ eq : propagation ] .",
    "a random variation of approximately 1% was added to the individual elements of @xmath78 to simulate the effects of measurement noise .",
    "we used these output intensities in the algorithm outlined above to reconstruct a set of @xmath80 and compared them with the known values of @xmath76 .",
    "for each set of propagation constants we ran the reconstruction algorithm 100 times to build up statistics on the quality of the reconstruction .",
    "the results for one particular run of the reconstruction are shown in figure [ fig : sim_rec_1 ] .",
    "the reconstruction was performed on a mcf containing 37 cores in a triangular array ( a `` 3-ring '' mcf ) .",
    "the total run time for the reconstruction was 60 minutes using matlab on a standard laptop computer .",
    "it can be seen that the residual @xmath60 gradually decreased as the space of @xmath81 was sampled , eventually reaching a minimum value .",
    "occasional increases in @xmath60 are observed when the algorithm accepts a bad move .",
    "the reconstructed values of propagation constant @xmath80 are displayed beneath the target set @xmath76 .",
    "the statistical results over 100 reconstructions of the same set of @xmath76 are displayed in figure [ fig : sim_rec_100 ] .",
    "this set of reconstructions was carried out in parallel on a quad - core desktop pc , resulting in a run time of approximately 45 hours .",
    "we envisage that this time could be significantly reduced ; beyond simple parallelisation of independent reconstructions , no particular effort was expended in optimising the code for speed .",
    "91 of the reconstructions satisfied our convergence condition , defined as having a residual @xmath60 within one standard deviation of the mean @xmath82 .",
    "the final set of reconstructed propagation constants @xmath83 plotted in figure [ fig : sim_rec_100 ] are the mean for each core of the @xmath80 values taken from those reconstructions that converged . in the vast majority of cases the target values of @xmath76 are within the standard deviation of the reconstructed values @xmath83 , confirming the validity of the reconstruction algorithm .",
    "we fabricated a 3-ring mcf consisting of 37 cores arranged in a regular triangular array , as shown in figure [ fig : mcf_setup_results ] .",
    "each core began as a graded - index germanium - doped preform that was drawn into a rod , jacketed and re - drawn .",
    "the mcf preform was constructed using 37 of these twice - drawn rods stacked with an additional layer of pure silica rods forming a dummy fourth ring to limit the deformation of the third ring of cores during the fibre draw .",
    "the mcf preform was drawn to a cane , jacketed , and finally drawn to fibre , resulting in cores with diameters of approximately 1.1@xmath84 m and separation of 8@xmath84 m .",
    "these cores can be modelled by step - index cores of radius 0.48@xmath84 m and index contrast 0.02 with an equivalent two - mode beat length of approximately 35 mm at a wavelength of 650 nm .",
    "the measurement apparatus is shown in figure [ fig : mcf_setup_results ] ( a ) . a 6.9 mm length of the mcf was cleaved , taking particular care to obtain cleaves that were flat and perpendicular to the fibre axis . using a femtosecond",
    "amplified fibre laser we generated optical supercontinuum in a photonic crystal fibre ( pcf ) @xcite and butt - coupled it directly to the mcf .",
    "the output from the mcf passed through a 10 nm bandpass filter to select the wavelength range of interest and the output face of the mcf was imaged onto a ccd camera . by scanning the pcf across the input face of the mcf we verified that the supercontinuum was coupled into only one core at a time ; due to the strong frequency - dependence of the coupling strength , the short - wavelength light reflected from the interference filter allowed us to monitor which core the light",
    "was coupled into even when the wavelength reaching the camera had spread across much of the structure .",
    "we moved the pcf between all the cores at the input and hence recorded 37 output intensity patterns @xmath51 for the 37 possible input conditions @xmath46 . with the pcf tip at the mid - point between three of the mcf cores , we recorded a background frame to subtract from the data .",
    "this was repeated for various wavelength ranges in the visible and near infra - red .",
    "we then ran our reconstruction algorithm on the data measured at a wavelength of 650 nm .",
    "the results of 100 runs are displayed in figure [ fig : mcf_setup_results ] .",
    "of these 100 runs , 95 converged and the resulting reconstructed variations in propagation constant for the 37 cores are displayed in panel ( d ) along with their associated standard deviations .",
    "the residual difference @xmath60 between the reconstructed and measured intensities for those runs that converged is larger than that for the simulated reconstruction in the previous section for four reasons : noise in the measured data ; uncertainty in the uniform value of @xmath33 used in the reconstruction ( though we note that the reconstructed @xmath72 are robust to small errors in @xmath33 ) ; variations in @xmath33 between cores in the mcf ; and the effects of averaging the variation in @xmath33 over the 10 nm filter bandwidth .",
    "nevertheless the residual @xmath60 for the runs that converged corresponds to a difference between the reconstructed and measured intensities that is approximately a quarter of its value were the propagation constants assumed to be uniform between all the cores , and the output intensities found using @xmath85 have less than 6% of their light in the `` wrong '' cores .",
    "the variations in @xmath85 are plotted arranged in their position in the mcf structure in figure [ fig : structure_results ] ; it can be seen that , although the differences in propagation constant contain a randomly - varying element , there is also a clear pattern to the variations : cores towards the edge of the fibre tend to have a larger propagation constant than those near the centre .",
    "this suggests a systematic variation in the structure as the mcf and if this pattern were accounted for only by differences in core size , we see from figure [ fig : two_core ] that it would correspond to the outer cores being slightly larger , by a factor of approximately 1.01 , than those at the centre .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the two cores for which the uncertainty in reconstructed propagation constant is largest are both at the corners of the structure ; corner cores have only three nearest neighbours and hence have the smallest interaction with the remainder of the structure .",
    "we have implemented a robust method of determining the variations in propagation constant in mcf that requires only straightforward measurements of intensity with a simple camera .",
    "we outlined an algorithm that allows the variations in propagation constant to be reconstructed if a constant coupling strength is assumed , and demonstrated that the algorithm successfully reconstructs target values of propagation constant .",
    "finally , we applied our technique to a 37-core mcf fabricated in - house and found that the propagation constants vary over a fractional range of @xmath86 .",
    "our method relies upon the mcf cores being strongly coupled .",
    "however , if the cores are similar , there is no fundamental reason why the same technique could not be applied to find the variations in mcf designed to have low coupling strength either by testing it at a longer wavelength or by drawing a section of the fibre preform to a smaller diameter for the purposes of testing .",
    "therefore we anticipate that this method will be of widespread use in characterizing mcf for all application areas .",

    "<S> it can be used to reformat light from a telescope s focal plane and guide it to a sensor , to filter out unwanted emission lines originating in the earth s atmosphere without the need for large monochromators @xcite , and to interface multimode inputs with devices that require single - mode operation @xcite . in quantum optics , coupled - core mcfs provide a platform for extending the dimensionality of quantum walks of single and entangled photons beyond the capabilities of planar @xcite or direct - write waveguide technology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mcf can also be used in optical switching and modelocking applications @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the application of mcf will always be limited by the precision that can be achieved in its fabrication . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if mcf is to be used as a filter for narrowband spectral features , bragg gratings must be written into the cores ; non - uniformity in the propagation constant between cores results in a spread in filter wavelength and a corresponding decrease in extinction across the device @xcite . to carry out a photonic quantum walk in mcf </S>",
    "<S> the cores must be strongly coupled ; any variation in propagation constant from core - to - core will accumulate phase mismatch across the mcf as the probability amplitude propagates . </S>",
    "<S> if this phase mismatch is too great , quantum correlations will no longer be observed at the output of the fibre . </S>",
    "<S> although in the case of sdm data transmission , coupling between the cores is usually undesirable @xcite , accurate characterization of the structural uniformity of the fibre would yield important information about its transmission characteristics .    obtaining information about the inevitable variations in fibre structure that arise during fabrication </S>",
    "<S> is not trivial @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> imaging the structure does not yield the required precision or accuracy . over long fibre lengths where the cores are weakly coupled , </S>",
    "<S> information about the coupling strength may be inferred from optical time - domain reflectometry @xcite though this provides no information about variations in propagation constant , and in some applications a sufficiently long length of mcf may not be available .    in this manuscript </S>",
    "<S> we present a method of determining the differences in propagation constant in mcf . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve this by using a short length of mcf in which the cores are strongly coupled . </S>",
    "<S> we measure output intensity distributions for various input fields , and using a monte carlo technique to reconstruct numerically the differences in propagation constant between the cores . </S>"
