    "hydrodynamic instabilities in the process of accretion onto a compact star may help to understand the time variability of the emission from x - ray binaries .",
    "for example , the supersonic motion of a compact star in a uniform gas , first described by hoyle & lyttleton ( 1939 ) , bondi & hoyle ( 1944 ) , was later found to be unstable in numerical simulations ( matsuda 1987 , fryxell & taam 1988 , matsuda 1992 , ruffert & arnett 1994 ) . in such flows ,",
    "the gas captured by the accretor is first heated and decelerated to subsonic velocities through a shock , and then accelerated to supersonic velocities towards the accretor .",
    "observationnal consequences of the instability were discussed by taam ( 1988 ) , livio ( 1992 ) , de kool & anzer ( 1993 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this instability is still poorly understood even in its simplest formulation . a recent attempt by foglizzo & ruffert ( 1999 ) has led us to look in more detail at the interplay of acoustic and entropy waves in the subsonic flow between the bow shock and the accretor .",
    "we identify in the present paper an entropic - acoustic cycle : entropy perturbations advected with the flow trigger acoustic waves propagating back to the shock , where in turn they trigger new entropy perturbations .",
    "the linear stability of this cycle depends on the efficiencies of these two processes , measuring :    \\(i ) the amplitude of the pressure perturbations @xmath0 propagating against the stream , triggered by the advection of an entropy wave of amplitude @xmath1 ,    \\(ii ) the amplitude of the entropy perturbation @xmath2 triggered by the interaction of an acoustic wave @xmath0 with a stationary shock .",
    "+ the entropic - acoustic cycle is a priori unstable if @xmath3 .",
    "as will be seen throughout this paper , a complete description of the entropic - acoustic instability requires to take into account acoustic waves @xmath4 propagating with the stream , triggered by the interaction of @xmath0 with the shock and refracted out by the flow gradients .",
    "+ since such entropic - acoustic cycles may be present in astrophysical flows other than the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion , the present paper is dedicated to a description of this generic mechanism in its most general formulation .",
    "similar entropic - acoustic cycles have been studied extensively in the context of jet nozzles , where the gravitational potential plays no role . in particular , the first process ( i ) is well known among the combustion community since the works of candel ( 1972 ) and marble ( 1973 ) .",
    "a clear overview of the subject can be found in marble & candel ( 1977 ) .",
    "an example of entropic - acoustic instability in nozzles is the ramjet rumble instability studied by abouseif , keklak & toong ( 1984 ) , where the combustion zone plays the same role as the shock in the second process ( ii ) . + the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",

    "consequently there is no region ii where the flow is uniform as in fig .",

    "the gravitational potential @xmath46 is responsible for both the acceleration and the heating of the flow .",
    "the lengthscale of the flow inhomogeneities decreases towards the accretor , so that we expect a strong refraction at low frequency and a negligible refraction at high frequency .",
    "if the accretion flow is accelerated up to supersonic velocities through a sonic surface , acoustic waves with a high enough frequency to penetrate in the supersonic region can not be refracted out : a frequency cut - off @xmath47 therefore corresponds to the highest frequency above which refraction becomes negligible .",

    "+ the propagation of acoustic waves in the first region is easily described using the conservation of their acoustic flux .",

    "we have described how the interplay of entropic and acoustic waves in a subsonic flow between a shock and a sonic point might lead to an entropic - acoustic linear instability .",
    "the ingredients for this type of instability are    \\(1 ) an accelerated subsonic flow with a significant increase of sound speed ( of temperature ) ,    \\(2 ) an outer boundary , such as a shock , capable of converting acoustic waves into entropy perturbations .",

[ imomegamax ] ) .",
    "the two timescales involved in the entropic - acoustic instability are :    - the period of the most unstable pertubations , of the order of the refraction cut - off ,    - the growth time , comparable to the time needed to advect an entropy perturbation from the shock to the sonic radius .",
    "+      the entropic - acoustic instability might be at work in several astrophysical situations : as already mentionned in the introduction , the supersonic motion of a compact star in a gas leads to the formation of a bow shock ahead of the accretor .",
    "the development of the entropic - acoustic instability in the subsonic region between the shock and the sonic surface is very likely , since @xmath128 in these flows ( ruffert 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "a detailed analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "+ the acoustic - entropic instability might also be present in some accretion discs .",
    "most stability calculations concerning adafs focussed on the _ local _ thermal stability of the disc ( narayan & yi 1995 , abramowicz 1995 , kato 1996 , 1997 , wu & li 1996 ) .",
    "by contrast , the entropic - acoustic instability is a _ global _ instability which depends on the outer boundary condition of the flow .",
    "the excitation of acoustic waves from an advected entropy perturbation in an adaf has already been observed in numerical simulations by manmoto ( 1996 ) , which include the additional effects of radiative cooling ( bremmstrahlung ) and viscous heating .",
    "their work was concerned with the time delay problem of cygnus x-1 and did not involve an outer boundary condition capable of closing the entropic - acoustic cycle .",
    "some global disc solutions match a thin disc to an inner adaf through a shock ( lu , gu & yuan 1999 ) .",
    "the entropic - acoustic cycle could then occur between this shock and the inner sonic surface . on a larger scale ,",
    "the gas falling from the lagrangian point @xmath129 onto the external radius of an accretion disc might also produce a shock capable of closing the entropic - acoustic cycle .",
    "these possible applications deserve a careful analysis which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "our one - dimensional description assumed that all the outgoing acoustic waves reach the shock , and that all the induced perturbations of entropy reach the sonic surface .",
    "depending on the topology of the flow , possible losses from the entropic - acoustic cycle must be taken into account . in the case of bondi - hoyle accretion ,",
    "outgoing acoustic waves reaching the shock out of the accretion cylinder produce entropy perturbations which will not be accreted , thus diminishing the effective efficiency @xmath90 of the cycle .",
    "a 3-d description of the entropic - acoustic cycle should also take into account the effect of vorticity perturbations , which are naturally created when an acoustic wave perturbs a shock with a non vanishing angle of incidence .",
    "like the entropy perturbations , the advection of a vorticity perturbation in a converging flow excites acoustic waves ( howe 1975 ) .",
    "their destabilizing effect will be studied in the particular case of radial accretion ( foglizzo 2000 ) .",
    "understanding the fundamental mechanism of linear instability is only the very first step towards a possible identification of this mechanism in the astrophysical observations . according to our linear description of the entropic - acoustic instability , we expect to observe significant variations of the mass accretion rate and displacements of the shock surface as the acoustic energy increases between the shock and the sonic surface .",
    "the determination of the spectrum of eigenfrequencies should give valuable informations about the timescale of the most unstable modes .",
    "numerical simulations should be the most direct way to describe the ultimate non - linear development of this instability .",
