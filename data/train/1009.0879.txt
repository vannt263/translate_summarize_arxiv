    "hawking s dramatic 1974 announcement that black holes evaporate thermally has led to a much - discussed paradox .",
    "if , as indicated by hawking s semi - classical analysis , the radiation spectrum is exactly thermal ( thus fully characterized by just a single parameter , temperature ) , the consequent loss of information violates a basic quantum principle , unitarity .",
    "a number of resolutions of this puzzle have been proposed , some of them are quite radical @xcite . + a conservative option , developed from 1994 by frank wilczek and his collaborators @xcite , is that back - reaction of the emissions on the geometry and thermal properties of the hole could result in information - carrying departures from thermality .",
    "specifically , emission of each discrete quantum is attended by a jump of hawking temperature , hence no longer definable by a single parameter .",
    "correlations carried by the resulting deviations from thermality , while individually small , could build up to a substantial information capacity over the course of the hole s lifetime .",
    "although earlier studies cast doubt on this possibility @xcite , recent work by zhang et al @xcite has given it credence .",
    "they concluded that up to @xmath0 bits of information can be carried off in the correlations , which can include all of the information in the hole if , as seems reasonable , the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath1 is a measure of the hole s _ information capacity _ , in the sense that @xmath0 is the maximum number of bits that can be accommodated in a black hole formed by an astrophysical collapse .",
    "kraus and wilczek s key result @xcite was their arithmetic - mean prescription ( amp , cf ( [ elcct22 ] ) below ) for the effective action ( including back - reaction ) of a massive particle ( modelled as a spherical shell in the s - wave approximation ) tunneling out of a spherical black hole .",
    "their analysis was encumbered by use of the intricate machinery of spherisymmetric hamiltonian gravity and required a dozen pages of closely reasoned argument even for the simplest example of uncharged ( schwarzschild ) evaporation .",
    "the much simpler and more transparent treatment introduced here calls upon the general - relativistic dynamics of thin shells , together with the analytic properties of schwarzschild s time co - ordinate @xmath2 over the extended kruskal manifold , and occupies just a few lines ( sec .",
    "[ sbk4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , this extends immediately to charged evaporation and brings new aspects of the problem into focus ",
    "breakdown of amp when interactions with nongravitational forces are introduced , the extremal ( zero - temperature ) limit and the possibility of black hole remnants .",
    "these aspects are further discussed ( but not fully resolved ) in sec .",
    "[ sbk4 ] , and the need for further work emphasized .    by way of introduction to this somewhat novel treatment of the black hole tunneling problem , sec .",
    "[ sbk3 ] rederives the classic schwinger formula for charged pair creation by an electric field , using the same ( essentially geometrical ) approach .",
    "comparison is instructive , revealing both the resemblance and at least one sharp difference between the two cases .    sec .",
    "[ sbk5 ] briefly reviews the key question on which the current literature makes a confused impression  does hawking radiation with kraus - wilczek deviations from thermality have information - holding correlations ?  and reaffirms the positive answer given by zhang et al @xcite . sec .",
    "[ sbk6 ] concludes the paper with some open questions .",
    "`` tunneling '' ( or `` barrier penetration '' ) is the term commonly used for energy - conserving quantum transitions that are classically forbidden . in such cases , a path - integral evaluation of the transition amplitude",
    "is hampered by the fact that the sum - over - paths is not dominated by any single(real ) path .",
    "the familiar remedy is analytic continuation of the time coordinate to pure imaginary values . in the resulting euclidean - signature spacetime",
    "a classical tunneling route often exists and dominates the sum - over - paths .",
    "the procedure is analogous to the steepest - descent method for evaluating a real definite integral by diverting the integration contour through a saddle point in the complex plane .",
    "( cf @xcite )    equivalently , one can set out from the time - independent schrdinger equation for a fixed energy .",
    "the ansatz @xmath3 yields the hamilton - jacobi equation for @xmath4 in wkb approximation .",
    "this identifies @xmath4 as the jacobi action or hamilton s characteristic function : @xmath5 among orbits of given energy between two given configurations , @xmath4 is minimized by the classical orbit . for configurations separated by a barrier , but connectable by a classical tunneling orbit in imaginary time , @xmath4 becomes complex and gives a tunneling probability @xmath6 in lowest - order approximation .",
    "( for more detatails , see e.g. @xcite )    equation ( [ tu2 ] ) has rather general validity and is readily applicable in situations where a tunneling path can be clearly defined , as in the case of a particle . for a field",
    ", a reduction procedure is needed to describe the tunneling of a 1-particle excitation . in an s - wave approximation on a spherical background ( e.g. a spherical black hole )",
    "the excitation can be modelled as a spherical shell .",
    "( the reduction is spelled out in some detail by kraus and wilczek @xcite for the special case of a charged scalar field propagating on the classical background of a radial electric field . )",
    "when we treat tunneling out of a spherical black hole in sec.[sbk4 ] we shall circumvent this rather elaborate reduction by inserting into ( [ tu1 ] ) the natural and simplest material action that is minimized by the classical orbit of the shell .",
    "the intuitive picture of tunneling out of a black hole suggested by the parikh - wilczek calculation @xcite is at first glance very different from the familiar one of charged - pair creation by a strong electric field .",
    "there is no black hole counterpart to the finite - width potential barrier that separates the oppositely charged pair . in a black hole",
    "the barrier is a causal one  the light cone that forms the future horizon .",
    "there are nonetheless strong resemblances between the two pictures .",
    "in this section we shall briefly re - derive schwinger s",
    "results @xcite to leading order in a geometrical way that points up the resemblance as well as highlighting an essential difference .",
    "we consider a uniform electric field @xmath7 directed along the positive x - axis of minkowski space - time .",
    "the energy of a point charge @xmath8 moving along the x - axis is @xmath9    ]    intuitively , a virtual pair ( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath11 ) located at @xmath12 and @xmath13 can extract enough energy ( @xmath14 ) to emerge as a real pair if they happen to reach a minimum separation determined by @xmath15 with a convenient choice of origin . assuming ( [ elcct2 ] ) as initial condition , the equation of motion @xmath16 integrates to give the hyperbolic path ( parametrized by proper time @xmath17 ) @xmath18 for the newly created positive charge @xmath8 , with @xmath8 replaced by @xmath19 for its partner .",
    "the two orbits are shown as cd and ab in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is straightforward to recast this picture of pair creation as a one - particle history .",
    "the particle s orbit may be traced through three stages ( ab , bc and cd in fig [ fig1 ] ) , in each of which the orbital equation is given by analytic extension of ( [ elcct2 ] ) in the complex @xmath17-plane , @xmath20 .    in the first stage ab , given by @xmath21 so that ( [ elcct3 ] ) becomes @xmath22 the particle enters from the left , moving backward in lorentz time @xmath2 , and is slowed by the field ( so that its effective charge / mass ratio at this stage is really @xmath23 ) until it comes to momentary rest at b.    the second ( tunneling ) stage is an excursion into imaginary time @xmath24 and imaginary momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the orbit ( [ elcct3 ] ) is now the semicircle bc : @xmath26 + in the third stage cd , given by @xmath27 , the orbit has re - entered real time and ( [ elcct3 ] ) describes the conventional picture of a particle , with charge / mass ratio @xmath28 , being accelerated to the right .",
    "the whole sequence may be interpreted as representing a virtual charge @xmath8 which has increased its effective mass from @xmath29 to @xmath30 by extracting energy @xmath31 from the field during the tunneling phase .",
    "+ from ( [ elcct1 ] ) and ( [ elcct3 ] ) it is easily checked directly that the total energy @xmath32 is conserved and , moreover , vanishing for this virtual particle .",
    "thus we do not need to distinguish between the jacobi and lagrange actions in this instance : @xmath33 setting @xmath34 and recalling that @xmath35 , we easily obtain from ( [ elcct4 ] ) and ( [ elcct5 ] ) for the tunneling phase @xmath36 hence the tunneling probability is @xmath37 in agreement with schwinger s classic result @xcite .",
    "our treatment of gravitational tunneling in the following section will closely follow these lines , but with one key difference . in the electric tunneling phase bc , work done on the rest mass by the field",
    "reversed its sign from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , or ( equivalently ) reversed the sense of proper time @xmath17 .",
    "the effect was a sign reversal of the inertial term @xmath38 in the action ( [ elcct6 ] ) , which was implemented by complexifying @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast , for a particle moving under gravity the gravitational force vanishes in its rest - frame by the equivalence principle and can not affect its rest mass .",
    "thus the inertial action and proper time remain real during the tunneling phase .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] is a kruskal map of an eternal black hole , partitioned by the two horizon sheets(at fixed @xmath39 ) into left , right , future and past sectors l , r , f and p. our universe is taken to be the r - sector ; in terms of this idealized eternal picture , the tunneling and evaporation of a particle can come about in two distinct ways .",
    "r tunneling in an eternal black hole , height=302 ]    energetically , the cheapest(hence most probable ) tunneling route is to a configuration in which the emerging particle has no kinetic energy .",
    "so this mechanism treats transitions between static or momentarily static configurations on opposite sides of the horizon .",
    "a virtual particle ( world line ab in figure [ fig2 ] ) starts from rest in sector l , enters a tunneling mode at b , then circulates in complex time around the semi - circle to c , whence it emerges in sector r as a real static particle . meanwhile , the hole s mass and charge have been reduced , and the surface gravity @xmath41 correspondingly increased , by loss of this particle - from @xmath42 in sector l before the tunneling , to @xmath43 in sector r after the particle has escaped .",
    "this picture closely resembles the schwinger tunneling picture of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "eternal black holes are not formed by real astrophysical collapse .",
    "the initial tunneling state in sector l has no real counterpart .",
    "so this tunneling model is further removed from reality than the picture of direct tunneling from f to r that we shall consider in the next section .",
    "however , it can be formulated completely and precisely , and allows effects of back - reaction to be easily accommodated .",
    "the extra stretch of the tunneling route from l into f en route to r adds no imaginary part to the action , since falling from l into f is classically allowable .",
    "to fix notation , the spherical geometries that we consider in this section have metrics of the general form @xmath44 this includes schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm black holes imbedded in flat , de sitter or ads backgrounds . at the horizon @xmath45 and the surface gravity is @xmath46 ( assumed non vanishing ) .",
    "advanced and retarded eddington - finkelstein coordinates @xmath47 are defined by @xmath48 and the corresponding kruskal coordinates @xmath49 by @xmath50 in theses coordinates , the metric is @xmath51 and is manifestly regular for all points(@xmath49 ) where @xmath52 is regular , including the two horizon sheets @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "schwarzschild time @xmath2 is initially defined only over the r - sector of the extended kruskal manifold of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it will be useful to extend it analytically to the full space in such a way that @xmath55 is positive - frequency with respect to the globally regular times @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this requires that @xmath55 be regular and bounded in the lower halves of the complex @xmath56 and @xmath57 planes .",
    "a definition which achieves this is @xmath58 in which we have selected that branch of @xmath59 which is regular on the lower - half @xmath60-plane , and real on the lower imaginary axis , so that its values , e.g for real @xmath61 ,    @xmath62    are left - right symmetric . the imaginary constant thereby added to @xmath2 in ( [ elcct15d ] ) does not affect time - differences in a given sector .",
    "moreover , it ensures manifest cpt invariance of the analytically extended transition and tunneling amplitudes that we are about to derive , i.e. , invariance under simultaneous reversal of @xmath63 .",
    "schwarzschild time @xmath2 is regular along the entire tunneling path abcd(fig [ fig2 ] ) and the background geometry is static ( apart from small back - reaction effects ) .",
    "it is therefore a suitable candidate to be complexified and used as the parameter for l@xmath40r tunneling .    in an s - wave approximation",
    "the tunneling ( charged ) particle is modeled as a spherical shell . according to ( [ a23 ] ) in appendix [ sdya ] , the appropriate(jacobi ) action is @xmath64 here",
    ", @xmath65 is the proper mass of the shell , @xmath17 its proper time and the bar in @xmath66 an arithmetical average over the two geometries , @xmath67 and @xmath68 exterior and interior to the shell .",
    "finally , @xmath32 is the energy of the shell when it emerges from the tunneling phase at c. if the shell is uncharged , and with just enough energy to reach infinity , this is simply the schwarzschild mass , @xmath69 . for a shell with charge @xmath70 emerging from a charged hole",
    ", @xmath32 is smaller than this by @xmath71 , the work done in lifting the shell from the horizon to infinity .",
    "thus , generally ,    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the electric potential at the horizon . from ( [ elcct15d ] ) , @xmath74 valid for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus , for an emission with schwarzschild mass - energy @xmath32 @xmath78 stemming from the imaginary - time path bc .",
    "this agrees with the parikh - wilczek result @xcite derived in painlev - gullstrand coordinates .",
    "hence the tunneling probability for emission of schwarzschild mass - energy @xmath32 from a charged black hole is , by ( [ tu2 ] ) , @xmath79 in which the effective hawking temperature @xmath80 is given as the harmonic mean of surface gravities @xmath42 and @xmath43 before and after emission .",
    "the energy distribution ( [ elcct17 ] ) was first derived by kraus and wilczek @xcite by a more elaborate route . since @xmath81 depends on @xmath32 , ( [ elcct17 ] )",
    "is no longer a simple boltzmann exponential . as shown by zhang et al @xcite(and as we shall outline in sec .",
    "[ sbk5 ] ) correlations present in these deviations from thermality have the capacity to carry off the maximum information content of the hole .",
    "tunnels through the initial location @xmath82 of the apparent horizon .",
    "finally ( b ) , the inner face @xmath83 tunnels through the shrunken horizon @xmath84 . ]    in a real black hole formed by collapse , the l - sector of the l@xmath40r tunneling scenario does not exist . a picture that corresponds more closely to our intuitive idea of hawking evaporation",
    "is shown in figure [ fig3 ] . a virtual particle , represented by a thin or thick spherical shell ( outer and inner face histories @xmath85 and @xmath83 ) , formed just beneath the future horizon @xmath82 , tunnels through the horizon from sector f to sector r and escapes .",
    "the attendant loss of mass causes the horizon to shrink from @xmath82 to @xmath84 .",
    "( in figs [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) the two face histories @xmath85 and @xmath83 are shown separately for clarity . )    using this overall picture , we shall here derive two formulae for the tunneling probability @xmath86 , based on the thin- and thick - shell models , and follow up with a discussion .",
    "both formulae appear in the literature , sometimes in one and the same paper . in the simplest case of schwarzschild evaporation the two formulae are equivalent , but they differ in general .    for optimum tunneling probability , the outward pre - tunneling velocity should be as large , and post - tunneling velocity as small ( compatible with marginal escape from the horizon ) as possible .",
    "this requires that both pre- and post - tunneling histories should be very nearly surfaces of constant retarded time @xmath87 .",
    "tunneling thus takes place between two given values of @xmath87 , inside and outside that horizon , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the surface gravities before and after the shell has escaped . according to ( [ elcct15f ] ) , in the process @xmath91 jumps from @xmath92 before the horizon shrinks to @xmath93 afterwards .",
    "( one way to visualize the tunneling for a thin shell is to imagine the pre- and post- tunneling histories reslotted so that the @xmath94 and @xmath95 axes are aligned .",
    "this permits both histories to be mapped onto a single kruskal diagram . )    in the appendix it is noted that schwarzschild time @xmath2 may be subjected to arbitrary space - dependent translations @xmath96 without affecting the validity of the expression for the jacobi action @xmath97 or the definition of conjugate variable @xmath32 , the energy measured at infinity .",
    "( we have slightly extended the thin - shell expression ( [ a23 ] ) so as to be applicable also to thick shells with layers of energy @xmath98  not an exact differential in general . )",
    "where , as in ( [ elcct15w ] ) , the tunneling energy @xmath98 is given by the ( inexact for @xmath99 ) differential form @xmath100    for the tunneling episode , the natural choice of parameter is @xmath101 .",
    "this yields for the imaginary part of the thin - shell action @xmath102 and for a thick shell , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the surface gravity after mass @xmath32 has been lost by the hole .",
    "( along the pre- and post- tunneling segments , one could take @xmath105 .",
    "they , of course , do not contribute to @xmath106 . )",
    "we can now go on to consider in turn the thin- and thick- shell tunneling models .    for a _ thin shell _ , we obtain from ( [ elcct15w ] ) , and the work of the appendix , @xmath107 where @xmath108 are the ( negative ) changes in the hole s mass and charge .",
    "this yields the tunneling probability @xmath109 in agreement with our result ( [ elcct17 ] ) for l@xmath40r thin - shell tunneling .",
    "we note that @xmath110 can be written more simply : @xmath111    in the case of a _ thick shell _ , we are faced with the inexactness of @xmath98 when @xmath99 , which makes the line integral ( [ elcct20 ] ) path - dependent and non - unique . if , however , we assume further that the evaporation is , to a sufficient approximation , quasi - stationary ",
    "i.e. , that we can neglect dissipative effects like gravitational radiation as the hole settles into its new configuration  then it follows from the first law of black hole mechanics @xcite that @xmath112 the ( negative ) changes of horizon area and bekenstein - hawking entropy , which _ are _ exact differentials .    the integral ( [ elcct20 ] ) now gives exactly and unambiguously @xmath113    because this derivation does not rely on spherical symmetry in any essential way , ( [ elcct25 ] ) extends readily to the evaporation of holes with spin .",
    "one then replaces ( [ elcct24 ] ) with the extended first law @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the hole s angular momentum and @xmath116 the angular velocity of the horizon .",
    "we forgo further details here , since the extension is straightforward .",
    "( in contrast , the corresponding extension of the thin - shell formula([elcct22 ] ) encounters the difficulty that it is generally impossible to achieve isometry of the two faces of a thin shell sandwiched between different kerr geometries . )    in ( [ elcct23 ] ) and ( [ elcct25 ] ) we have two different formulae , based on a thin - shell and a continuum model respectively , for the emission probability @xmath117 from a charged black hole .",
    "explicitly , the exponents are @xmath118 for the thin- and thick - shell cases respectively",
    ". for uncharged black holes these two expressions agree , but they begin to diverge for non - vanishing charge .",
    "it will require a deeper investigation to decide which of these expressions is more correct , or ( more likely ) to bring to light some more complex formula which amalgamates features of both .",
    "both depend only , as they should , on the observable , i.e. the states before and after emission .",
    "one expects discontinuous aspects of the quantized emission to be more marked at low temperatures , and here the thin - shell formula ( [ elcct23 ] ) , which predicts zero emission probability for zero temperature ( @xmath119 ) , accords well with expectations . in general , however , it is not clear how well a thin - shell idealization is able to handle the complex form of the einstein - maxwell interaction term @xmath120 in ( [ elcct21 ] ) .",
    "the arithmetic - mean prescription ( [ a18 ] ) for the thin - shell action was designed to deliver the right classical equations of motion ( [ a19 ] ) for the shell , but that depends on the simple bilinear form @xmath121 of the interaction ( [ a16 ] ) .",
    "arithmetic - mean recipes are generally limited to linear theories ( like einstein s in the distributional limit  only terms linear in second metric - derivatives survive in the curvature ) and bilinear interactions . on these grounds",
    "we tend to favour the continuum - model formula ( [ elcct25 ] ) over ( [ elcct23 ] ) for charged black holes whose surface gravity is not too small . it is questionable whether naturally evaporating black holes ever approach a state of extremality ( stable or unstable ) ; numerical evidence suggests that angular momentum and charge are evaporated preferentially .",
    "all of this raises questions worth exploring further , in particular the speculative possibility of stable , information - storing black hole remnants .",
    "we found in the previous section that the probability of a black hole of mass @xmath122 and charge @xmath8 ( hence bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath123 ) decaying to a state @xmath124 is @xmath125 according to a thick - shell model for the evaporating particle .",
    "( on the alternative thin - shell model , ( [ elcct61 ] ) becomes an inequality , @xmath126 . )",
    "the result is obviously transitive and leads to @xmath127 for any chain of decays ending in complete evaporation .",
    "if @xmath128 is the number of ways the hole can evaporate , we must have @xmath129 .",
    "hence @xmath130 this gives an interpretation of the bekenstein - hawking entropy in terms of the number of modes of evaporation .",
    "equation ( [ elcct61 ] ) can now be reinterpreted as equating , to leading order ( up to a neglected cross - section factor ) , the transition probability to a statistical factor @xmath131 , equal to the ratio of the number of final states to initial states .",
    "thus , the degrees of freedom in the outgoing radiation equal ( or even exceed , on the thin - shell model ) the maximum information capacity of the hole , as measured by the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "this provides evidence , purely on the basis of counting , that unitarity could be preserved and that the radiation has enough room to accommodate all of the information .",
    "( but this has not been a matter of universal agreement@xcite . )    in a significant paper @xcite , zhang et al have reopened the question whether deviations from exact thermality encoded in ( [ elcct23 ] ) or ( [ elcct61 ] ) produce correlations actually capable of carrying information .",
    "generally , one defines the correlation coefficient @xmath132 between two events @xmath133 and @xmath134 by @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the probability of both @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and @xmath137 the probability of @xmath134 .",
    "conditional _ probability of @xmath134 ( given that @xmath133 has already occurred ) is @xmath138    in our case ( confining the argument to uncharged evaporation for simplicity ) , the probability that a black hole of mass @xmath122 emits a quantum of energy @xmath32 is , by ( [ elcct61 ] ) , @xmath139 \\big\\}\\ ] ] and this yields a nontrivial correlation @xcite @xmath140    it might be thought that one should replace @xmath141 in ( [ elcct65 ] ) by @xmath142 to take account of mass loss from the first emission .",
    "that would be tantamount to replacing @xmath143 in ( [ elcct63 ] ) by the conditional probability @xmath144 .",
    "but one sees at once from ( [ elcct64 ] ) that this would give @xmath145 identically for _ any _ two events .",
    "the argument is clearly circular : it absorbs the correlations themselves into the test for their existence .",
    "thus , as emphasized in @xcite , the original conclusion ( [ elcct65 ] ) is correct .",
    "the radiation does have correlations and , according to ( [ elcct62 ] ) , these have the capacity to carry off the maximum information content of the hole .",
    "the argument for information loss in black hole evaporation rested , first and foremost , on the belief that the emerging spectrum is exactly thermal . since 1994 this main pillar of the argument has toppled .",
    "a series of investigations has shown that , when back - reaction of the emission is allowed for , there are departures from thermality@xcite , and that the associated correlations have the capacity to carry off the maximum information content of the hole @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have reviewed , simplified and somewhat extended this work .    a logically prior issue , not touched on in this work , is the extent to which the emission process can access and extricate information buried in the depths of the hole . the wavelength and period of the radiation when it reaches infinity are of the order of the hole s diameter and characteristic internal time ( i.e. maximum proper free - fall time from the horizon ) , suggesting that access is possible . on the other hand ,",
    "the original mode analyses , ( non - local , but still the best evidence for thermality across the spectrum ) and the usual particle tunneling and pair - creation arguments suggest a localized , near - horizon process with high frequencies at formation that are subsequently redshifted .",
    "this would make the emission an exclusively surface process , without access to the interior .",
    "however , the uncertainty principle forbids such definite allocation of the place and time of emission for a quantum of given energy .",
    "it can not be ruled out that much of the radiation reaches infinity without substantial redshift , having been formed by concerted , coherent action of the entire hole .",
    "the issue clearly needs further study ( cf @xcite ) but may well turn out to be a red herring as a possible culprit for information loss .",

    "( our use of the same symbols @xmath179 for densities per unit volume and unit area in these different contexts should not cause confusion . )    our specific concern in section [ sbk4 ] is with a class of spherical shells moving in spherical geometries of the form @xmath180 with different functions @xmath181 and @xmath182 and time coordinates @xmath76 and @xmath75 in @xmath148 and @xmath147 . in all geometries of the form ( [ a10 ] ) ,",
    "the einstein field equations require @xmath183 , which implies that @xmath184 and @xmath185 at the shell by virtue of ( [ a1b ] ) .",
    "thus in this class of spacetimes , the ambient pressures do no work and the shell s internal energy is conserved .        where @xmath189 is the shell s proper mass , @xmath190 and @xmath191 is the surface pressure . the expression ( [ a11a ] )",
    "follows at once from @xmath192 where @xmath193 the sign factor @xmath194 determines whether @xmath195 is increasing or decreasing outwards ( i.e , in the direction from @xmath148 to @xmath147 ) , and the subscript @xmath17 indicates @xmath196 .",
    "( physically , @xmath197 and @xmath198 could be interpreted as energies of test particles of unit rest mass attached to the inner and outer shell faces . )",
    "the rationalized version of ( [ a11a ] ) is @xmath199 the bar denotes an arithmetical mean @xmath200 and we have defined the schwarzschild mass @xmath201 interior to radius @xmath195 by @xmath202 the simplest illustration is a shell of mass @xmath122 in empty space : ( [ a11 ] ) or ( [ a13 ] ) yields @xmath203 which is a decomposition of the total ( conserved ) mass - energy @xmath122 in a form whose newtonian counterpart is self - evident .",
    "+ these results extend readily to charged shells .",
    "we simply augment the action ( [ a2])+([a6 ] ) with an interaction term @xmath204 plus the usual free - field lagrangian @xmath205 .",
    "our spherical constraint admits only radial electric fields , for which @xmath206 is gauge - reducible in static @xmath207 coordinates to a single component @xmath208 in @xmath209 respectively , up to an additive constant which could be adjusted across the shell .",
    "the shell s charge is @xmath70 and ( [ a14 ] ) reduces to @xmath210 adding ( [ a16 ] ) to the action does not affect the junction conditions or equations of motion in the forms ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a11 ] ) or ( [ a13]).(they were obtained by varying the metric in the action ; however , ( [ a16 ] ) is independent of the metric . )",
    "electric forces are nonetheless now at work in these equations , for instance through the faraday stresses now present in @xmath211 on the right - hand side of ( [ a1b ] ) .",
    "+ our assumption of spherical symmetry has reduced the effective dynamics to one degree of freedom  the shell radius @xmath212 .",
    "we recall that the shell was introduced in the first place in sec .",
    "[ sbk4 ] as an s - wave approximation to the wave function for _ particles _ tunneling radially , so that a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional description is entirely apposite .",
    "however , the action that we have is still ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional , and saddled with elements , such as a 3-dimensional extrinsic curvature , foreign to a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional dynamics .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to seek a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional effective lagrangian which delivers the same equations of motion for r and whose hamiltonian generates the corresponding quantum evolution .",
    "a lagrangian of this sort emerges if we retain just the mechanical , non - geometrical parts ( [ a6])+([a14 ] ) of the original action : @xmath213 to fix the lagrangian we still need to choose a time - coordinate invariant under euler - lagrange variation of the particle s world - line.(proper time @xmath17(=arc length ) is clearly inadmissible ) as we shall see , a formally successful(as well as physically desirable ) choice is a static observer s time @xmath2 , split evenly between the alternatives @xmath75 and @xmath76 by taking the arithmetic mean of the + and - actions .",
    "this prescription leads to the following explicit form of ( [ a17 ] ) : @xmath214 the upper bar denotes an arithmetic mean , @xmath215 ; @xmath216 , where @xmath217 are adjustable constants , and we have used @xmath218 , which follows from ( [ a12 ] ) .      on the other hand , the junction condition ( [ a11a ] ) can be written in either of the forms ( @xmath221 ) @xmath222 addition yields @xmath223 differentiation of this equation yeilds a second order equation of motion identical with ( [ a19 ] ) , when @xmath224 has the reissner - nordstrm form .",
    "@xmath226 is conserved by hamilton s equations for a time - independent background .",
    "explicit evaluation for reissner - nordstrm fields , using definition ( [ a12 ] ) , shows that @xmath227 where @xmath228 , @xmath229 equal to the shell s schwarzschild mass .",
    "it is , incidentally , straightforward to verify that ( [ a17 ] ) is the action , and ( [ a20 ] ) the hamiltonian , for a charged test _ particle _ moving radially in the spherical geometry ( [ a10 ] ) .    the effective action ( [ a18 ] ) is taken between given endpoints@xmath230 . under a change of endpoints , the change of extremal action is given by the hamilton - jacobi formula @xmath231",
    "^ 2_1=[p\\delta r]-e(\\delta t_2-\\delta t_1 ) \\label{a22}\\ ] ] ( where we have assumed @xmath232 )    our interest in section [ sbk3 ] et seq is in the probability for a particle of given _ energy _ @xmath32 to tunnel between given points @xmath233 and @xmath234 straddling a horizon ; the tunneling time is irrelevant . the path which maximizes this probability is the path which minimizes the jacobi action .",
