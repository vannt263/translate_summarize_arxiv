    "one of the most interesting results of the heavy ion program at rhic is the so - called jet quenching @xcite @xcite . the yield of particles produced in @xmath10 collisions at mid - rapidities and large @xmath0 increases with centrality much less than the number of binary collisions @xmath11 . for most central collisions",
    "the large @xmath0 yield is suppressed by a factor 4 - 5 as compared to the result expected from this scaling .",
    "this phenomenon is particularly interesting since it is not observed in deuteron - gold collisions at rhic at mid - rapidities @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the yield with respect to the scaling in @xmath11 is well known in soft collisions . in this case",
    "the phenomenon is observed in hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions at all energies .",
    "it is well described in the framework of string models , such as the dual parton model ( dpm ) and the quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) , when shadowing corrections are taken into account @xcite . with increasing @xmath0 the shadowing corrections decrease @xcite and the scaling with @xmath11 is predicted in perturbative qcd . actually , the observed increase is even faster due to initial state interactions , the so - called cronin effect .    at very high energies the shadowing effects are very important for @xmath12 and @xmath10-collisions",
    "( see for example @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "these nonlinear effects lead , as @xmath13 , to `` saturation '' of the distributions of partons in the colliding hadrons and nuclei @xcite",
    ". detailed calculations of shadowing effects at rhic and lhc energies @xcite , show that these effects are important for the description of inclusive spectra , but the situation is still far from the `` saturation '' limit .",
    "this is true for particles with average momentum transfer . for particles with large momentum transfer , which we study in this paper",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "it is well known that shadowing effects for partons take place at very small @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nucleon mass and @xmath17 is the radius of the nucleus . on the other hand , partons which produce a state with transverse mass @xmath18 and a given value of feynman @xmath19 , have @xmath20 .",
    "thus , at fixed initial energy @xmath21 the condition for existence of shadowing will not be satisfied at large transverse momenta .",
    "for example in the central rapidity region ( @xmath22 ) at rhic and for @xmath0 of jets ( particles ) above 5(2 ) gev / c the condition for shadowing is not satisfied and these effects are absent . it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in this region , where @xmath23 , there are in general final state interactions , which can be treated in a simple quasiclassical way .",
    "these interactions lead , in particular , to an energy loss of a parton ( particle ) in the dense medium produced in the collision .",
    "the situation is very similar to production of heavy quarkonia in @xmath24 and @xmath10 collisions @xcite , where most of the present data correspond to energies below the critical one and a simple probabilistic interpretation can be applied .",
    "note that these `` final state '' interactions are absent in the shadowing region .",
    "hadrons loose a finite fraction of their longitudinal momentum due to secondary interactions with hadrons of the nucleus .",
    "this is a characteristic property of such theoretical models as dpm and qgsm and agrees with approximate feynman scaling of inclusive spectra in the fragmentation regions . from this point of view",
    ", it is natural to expect that a particle scattered at some non zero angle will also loose a fraction of its transfer momentum due to final state interaction .",
    "this is a characteristic property of soft hadronic interactions . in perturbative qcd",
    "the situation is more complicated @xcite . in the following",
    "we will assume that final state interactions are mostly soft ones .",
    "the aim of the present work is to describe the suppression of the yield of pions in a framework , based on final state interactions , similar to the one used by the authors in order to describe the suppression of @xmath1 @xcite . in the latter case , the origin of the suppression is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "the @xmath25-@xmath26 pair interacts with nucleons of the nucleus ( normal absorption or nuclear absorption , controlled by @xmath27 ) . on the other hand , the @xmath25-@xmath26 pair ( at times close to initial time @xmath28 ) or the @xmath1 ( at larger times ) , interacts with the dense medium produced in the collision ( anomalous absorption , controlled by @xmath29 ) . in both cases , as a result of the interaction , a @xmath30 pair is produced instead of a @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that in hadron - nucleus collisions , the density of the medium is small enough and such that the effect of the interaction with the medium is negligible .",
    "thus , this effect is only present in nucleus - nucleus collisions  hence its qualification of anomalous .    in the case of large @xmath0 production",
    "the particle does not disappear as a result of the interaction but its @xmath0 is shifted to smaller values .",
    "due to the steepness of the @xmath0 distribution , the effect may be quite large .",
    "moreover , in this case there is also a gain of the yield at a given @xmath0 due to particles produced at larger @xmath0  which have experienced a @xmath0 shift due to the interaction with the medium .",
    "this gain is significantly smaller than the corresponding loss due to the steepness of the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "another difference with respect to the @xmath1 case is that here the suppression vanishes at low @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , when the @xmath0 of the produced particle is close to @xmath31 , its @xmath0 can either increase or decrease as a result of the interaction , i.e. in average the @xmath0 shift tends to zero .",
    "therefore , the above mechanism will not change the results obtained @xcite in dpm for soft collisions .",
    "it turns out that in our formalism most of the observed suppression takes place at very early times , where the density of the medium is higher .",
    "since hadron formation times are longer , most of the suppression takes place at a pre - hadronic ( partonic ) level .",
    "therefore , the mechanism described below is not a conventional hadronic final state interaction and , qualitatively , is expected to lead to similar results as the jet quenching  based on radiative parton energy loss . further discussion on this point can be found in the conclusions .",
    "the interaction of a large @xmath0 particle with the soft medium is described by the gain and loss differential equations which govern final state interactions . in the following",
    ", the large @xmath0 particle will be a @xmath2 and the medium will be all charged and neutral secondaries produced in @xmath32 collisions at @xmath33  gev . denoting by @xmath34 and @xmath35 the corresponding space - time densities , we have following @xcite    [ 1e ] d_h(x , p_t ) d^4x = - _ s    where @xmath29 is the final state interaction cross - section , averaged over the momentum distribution of the colliding particles .",
    "the first term describes the loss of @xmath2 s with a given @xmath0 , due to its interaction with the medium with density @xmath35 .",
    "the second term describes the ( smaller ) gain in the yield at a given @xmath0 resulting from the @xmath2 s produced at @xmath36 , which have suffered a shift in @xmath0 due to the interaction . in the conventional treatment @xcite of eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) , one uses cylindrical space - time variables with the longitudinal proper time @xmath37 , space - time rapidity @xmath38  to be identified later on with the usual rapidity  and transverse coordinate @xmath39 .",
    "one also assumes longitudinal boost invariance .",
    "therefore , the above picture is not valid in the fragmentation regions .",
    "one further assumes that the dilution in time of the densities is only due to longitudinal motion which leads to a @xmath40 dependence on @xmath41 .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) can then be written in the form @xcite @xcite [ 2e ]  n_^0(b , s , y , p_t ) d = - n(b , s , y )    where @xmath42 @xmath43 is the density of all charged plus neutral particles per unit rapidity and per unit of transverse area at fixed impact parameter , integrated over @xmath0 .",

    "it is invariant under the change @xmath46 and , thus , the result depends only on the ratio @xmath47 .",
    "we use the inverse proportionality between proper time and densities and put @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 is the density of charged and neutral particles per unit rapidity for minimum bias @xmath51 collisions at @xmath52   gev . at @xmath53 , @xmath54  @xmath55 .",
    "this density is about 90 % larger than at sps energies . since the corresponding increase in the @xmath10 density is comparable , the average duration time of the interaction will be approximately the same at cern - sps and rhic , about 5 to 7 fm .",

    "( [ 2e ] ) is the density at time @xmath28 , i.e. the density produced in the primary collisions .",
    "it can be computed in dpm .",
    "the procedure is explained in detail in @xcite . the hard density @xmath57 in the primary collision is assumed to scale with the number of binary collisions broadening , this scaling is not satisfied and its violation depends on the value of @xmath58 ( see column i ot table 1 ) .",

    "since it is not our purpose here to describe the @xmath0 broadening we take it from experiment .",
    "of course , the data also contain the effect of the final state interaction .",
    "however the effect of the latter is only important at medium and large @xmath0 and it hardly changes the value of @xmath31 ( from the calculation in ref .",
    "[ 9b ] this change is of the order of 1 % ) . as discussed above ,",
    "two mechanisms are responsible for the @xmath0 broadening .",
    "first , the decrease of the shadowing with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this produces an increase of the ratio    [ 6e ] r_aa(b , y , p_t ) = dn^aa dy d^2p_t(b)/n(b ) dn^pp dyd^2p_t    from its small @xmath0 value ( substantially lower than unity @xcite ) to one .",
    "this contribution to the @xmath0 broadening can be computed @xcite at each value of @xmath39 , @xmath76 , @xmath0 and @xmath58 without adjustable parameters in terms of the ( experimentally known ) diffractive cross - section .",
    "the shadowing computed in this way describes the emc effect @xcite .",
    "moreover , incorporated in dpm , it gives a good description of the centrality dependence of the charged particle inclusive spectra in nucleus - nucleus collisions both at sps and rhic energies @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism is the cronin effect proper , which produces an increase of @xmath77 above unity .",
    "it turns out that at low @xmath0 , where @xmath77 is below unity , most of the increase of @xmath77 with @xmath0 is due to the first mechanism .",
    "however , the second is not negligible and it is difficult to compute . in view of",
    "that we proceed as follows .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 distribution of @xmath2 s in @xmath32 at each @xmath58 is obtained from the corresponding one in @xmath51 by keeping the same value of @xmath70 and changing the scale @xmath78 into @xmath79 @xmath80 . in this way",
    ", the average @xmath0 of the new distribution coincides with the measured value @xmath81 at the corresponding centrality @xcite .",
    "we can thus compute the ratio @xmath77 , eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) , in the absence of final state interaction . the reasons for assuming that @xmath82 is not changed are twofold .",
    "on the theoretical side , this is needed in order to reproduce the @xmath0 broadening due to the variation of shadowing with @xmath0 . indeed , at large @xmath0 the shadowing vanishes and the ratio @xmath77 is independent of @xmath0  which requires that @xmath82 is constant should tend to unity at large @xmath0 .",
    "however , this may occur at much larger values of @xmath0 than present ones . ] . on the experimental side",
    ", we notice that the value of @xmath82 obtained in @xmath83 is the same as in @xmath51 within errors .",
    "note also that a substantial change in @xmath82 would lead to a strong variation of @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath0 at large @xmath0  which does not seem to be the case experimentally .    in order to fix the absolute normalization we use the value of @xmath77 obtained from dpm in the case of soft collisions ( i.e. integrated over @xmath0 ) which describes well the experimental results at all centralities @xcite . in this way we obtain for the 10  % most central collisions ( @xmath86 )",
    "the result shown in table 1 ( column i ) .    to these values",
    "we apply the correction due to the suppression factor @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ 3e ] ) .",
    "first , we neglect the second term in eqs .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) and ( [ 2e ] ) .",
    "the formula is then identical to the one for the @xmath1 case , as discussed above , and the suppression is independent of @xmath0 . in order to normalize our result to the experimental values of @xmath77 at large @xmath0 , we use @xmath87  mb , which gives a suppression factor @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding results are given by column ii in table 1 .",

    "we obtain the results in columns iii and iv of table 1 , respectively and in fig .  1 .",
    "we observe a slight increase of @xmath77 at large @xmath0 , consistent with the data for @xmath97  gev / c .",
    "the results tend to those in column i with increasing value of @xmath98  as it should be .",
    "the important result here is that , with constant @xmath98 , one obtains a small increase of @xmath77 with @xmath0 consistent with the data at large @xmath0 ( @xmath99  gev / c ) .",
    "the result is rather insensitive to the value of the shift , for any @xmath100  gev / c .",
    "of course , the problem at small @xmath0 remains . in order to cure it , we assume that @xmath101 . in this case",
    "the factor @xmath61 is 1 at @xmath102 as it should be .",
    "taking @xmath103 we obtain the values in column v of table 1 and in fig .  1 .",
    "note that these values are rather insensitive to the fraction ( 5 % ) of @xmath0 lost in each interaction . varying this fraction between 1  % and 10  % the results",
    "do not change substantially .",
    "we see from table 1 and fig .",
    "1 that the slight increase of @xmath77 obtained with constant @xmath98 is changed into a slight decrease , also consistent with the data , and , moreover , the agreement at small @xmath0 is significantly improved . actually , a better agreement in the low @xmath0 region is obtained assuming    [ 7e ] p_t = ( p_t  -  < p_t>_b)^1.5/20  .",
    "the results are given in column vi of table 1 and in fig .",
    "as discussed above , we assume @xmath104 in order to implement the condition @xmath105 as @xmath106 .",
    "the power @xmath107 controls the way in which this limit is reached .",
    "although such a behaviour is needed at low @xmath0 , it does not have to be the same at large @xmath0 .",
    "( in fact a power larger than unity can not be used at large @xmath0 since @xmath98 would be larger than @xmath0 ) .",
    "actually one obtains an equally good agreement with data using @xmath108 for @xmath109  gev / c and @xmath110 for @xmath111  gev / c . in this case the result is given in column vii of table 1 and in fig .  2 .",
    "the important result is that at large @xmath0 ( @xmath99  gev / c ) we obtain a slight increase of @xmath77 with @xmath0 for constant @xmath112 and a slight decrease for @xmath113 ( or @xmath114 ) . in both cases",
    "there is agreement with phenix data [ 1a ] .",
    "the centrality dependence of @xmath115 at large @xmath0 ( @xmath116  gev / c ) is reasonably well described ( see figs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "the constancy of @xmath115 ( @xmath116  gev / c ) for @xmath117 is the result of a cancellation , in this range of @xmath118 , between the increase of the @xmath0 broadening and the increase of the suppression with increasing centrality .",
    "this centrality dependence has been reproduced in a recent work , also based on absorption in a dense medium @xcite .",
    "we turn next to minimum - bias @xmath83 collisions . here",
    "gev / c @xcite . with the same value of @xmath82 as above @xmath120",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath121 .",
    "calculating the ratio @xmath83 to @xmath51 and fixing the normalization from the dpm value ( integrated over @xmath0 ) of this ratio , we obtain the result in table 2 .",
    "these values , obtained without introducing nuclear absorption , are in agreement with experiment in the lower half of the @xmath0 range . at large @xmath0 , nuclear absorption",
    "is expected to be present both in @xmath83 and @xmath32 collisions .",
    "the @xmath83 data at large @xmath0 are consistent with the presence of nuclear absorption . however , the error bars are too large in order to perform a quantitative study of this question  and determine the value of @xmath27 collisions would result in a smaller value of @xmath29 . ] .    finally , we turn to the @xmath83 collisions at forward rapidities .",
    "consider first the ratio @xmath85 integrated over @xmath0 . in our approach , @xmath85 decreases as @xmath122 increases .",
    "there are two effects contributing to this decrease .",
    "the first effect is basically due to energy - momentum conservation .",
    "it has been known for a long time in hadron - nucleus collisions at sps energies ( as well as at lower ones ) and it is well understood in string models such as dpm and qgsm .",
    "recently , it has been referred to as the low @xmath0 `` triangle '' @xcite .",
    "its extreme form occurs in the hadron fragmentation region , where the yield of secondaries in collisions off a heavy nucleus is smaller than the corresponding yield in hadron - proton .",
    "this phenomenon is known as nuclear attenuation .",
    "it turns out , that , at rhic energies , this effect produces a decrease of @xmath85 of about 30  % between @xmath95 and @xmath123 .",
    "the second effect is the increase of the shadowing corrections in @xmath83 with increasing @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "this produces a decrease of @xmath124 between @xmath95 and @xmath123 of about 30  % for pions produced in minimum bias collisions . here",
    "the shadowing decreases with increasing @xmath96 , but its variation is much smaller than in @xmath83 @xcite . ] .",
    "this decrease is practically independent of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we expect a suppression factor of about 1.7 between @xmath124 at @xmath95 and at @xmath123 , practically independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this is consistent with the brahms results [ 2b ] .",
    "the same result is obtained with the procedure used above in @xmath32 collisions , if the @xmath31 of pions in @xmath83 is the same at @xmath125 and at @xmath123 .",
    "this is approximately the case in @xmath32 collisions [ 1b ] and , in our approach , it is expected also in @xmath83 . indeed , as discussed above , most of the @xmath0 broadening at low @xmath0 is due to the variation of shadowing with @xmath0  and this variation is practically the same at @xmath95 and at @xmath123 . on the contrary , the dependence of shadowing on centrality at fixed @xmath96 is quite important and , thus , the centrality dependence of @xmath124 is quite large .",
    "details with be presented elsewhere collisions .",
    "so the authors are unable to describe data at large @xmath96 ( contrary to our approach , where dynamical shadowing is taken into account ) . ] .",
    "in this work the suppression of @xmath2 production at large @xmath0 in @xmath32 collisions is described in terms of final state interaction in the dense medium produced in the collision .",
    "the mechanism is similar to the one responsible for @xmath1 suppression .",
    "a nice feature of our formulation is that it leads to a suppression of @xmath115 at large @xmath0 ( @xmath89  gev / c ) which is rather insensitive to the size and form of the @xmath0 shift produced by the final state interaction .",
    "our approach contains dynamical , non - linear , shadowing .",
    "this shadowing is determined in terms of ( experimentally known ) diffractive cross - sections . as @xmath13",
    ", it leads to saturation of the parton distributions .",
    "however , at both rhic and lhc energies , this shadowing is significantly smaller than the one present in a saturation regime . by itself ,",
    "the shadowing in our approach is not sufficient to explain the difference in @xmath85 between @xmath126 and @xmath123 measured by brahms .",
    "indeed , it produces only about one half of the measured variation .",
    "however , when the effect of shadowing ( i.e. the increase of shadowing with increasing rapidity ) is combined with low @xmath0 effects present in string models such as dpm and qgsm , agreement with the brahms measurement is achieved .",
    "this also shows that decreasing @xmath14 by increasing energy is not equivalent to doing so by going to forward rapidities . in the latter case the value of @xmath85 at low @xmath0",
    "is substantially reduced  which obviously influences its large @xmath0 value .",
    "this is not so in the former case .    in this paper",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the study of the @xmath2 large @xmath0 suppression .",
    "other observables have been measured such as the back - to - back and near side large @xmath0 azimuthal correlations and large @xmath0 azimuthal anisotropy . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the present data on these observables indicate that the suppression takes place at very early times , where the density of the medium is larger .",
    "however , this does not imply that the suppression is due to non - abelian radiative parton energy loss .",
    "indeed , as discussed in section 1 , in our mechanism the suppression also takes place at very early times , at a partonic level . in view of that",
    ", we expect that the results for these observables will be similar to the ones obtained in the radiative jet quenching scenario . in our approach",
    "the back - to - back correlation will be suppressed by the same amount as the single particle one , whereas the near - side one will remain essentially the same  since the two large @xmath0 particles originate from the same jet .",
    "likewise , a high @xmath0 azimuthal anisotropy is expected in our approach due to the asymetry of the dense medium at early times .",
    "the large @xmath0 suppression phenomenon is important in order to determine the properties of the dense medium in which it takes place . in our approach , using the inverse proportionality between density and interaction time , we find that in a central @xmath127 @xmath127 collisions the density of the medium is about 5 times larger than in @xmath51 .",
    "this factor is predicted to be practically unchanged at lhc energies . in a radiative jet quenching scenario",
    "much larger densities have been claimed in the literature .",
    "however , in a recent paper @xcite , the density of the medium has been found to increase by a factor 4 between peripheral and central @xmath127 @xmath127 collisions at rhic ",
    "consistent with our result .    in order to distinguish between radiative jet quenching scenario and collisional energy loss or collisional @xmath0-shift",
    "it will be very interesting to measure the detailed medium modifications of jet shapes and multiplicities @xcite .",
    "while we do not see at present how to disentangle the different scenarios on the basis of qualitative arguments , there will hopefully be differences in their predictions at a qualitative level .",
