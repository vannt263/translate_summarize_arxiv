    "it has been known for a long time that tissue , in particular tumour tissue , is sensitive to ionising radiation .",
    "therefore it is only natural that tumours have been treated with various types of radiation , like @xmath1-rays and electrons .",
    "@xmath1-rays are easily available from radioactive sources , like @xmath2co , and electrons can be accelerated to @xmath3-energies by relatively inexpensive linear accelerators .",
    "the disadvantage of @xmath1-rays and electrons is that they deposit most of their energy close to the surface . to reduce the surface dose in tumour treatment requires rotating the source or the patient so that the surface dose is distributed over a larger volume .",
    "in contrast , protons and heavy ions deposit most of their energy close to the end of their range ( bragg - peak ) .",
    "the increase in energy loss at the bragg - peak amounts to a factor of about 5 compared to the surface dose , depending somewhat on the particle s energy .",
    "heavy ions offer , in addition , the possibility to monitor the destructive power of the beam by observing annihilation radiation by standard positron - emission tomography techniques ( pet ) .",
    "the annihilation radiation is emitted by @xmath4-active nuclear fragments produced by the incident heavy ion beam itself .",
    "a photon beam is attenuated in matter according to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the initial intensity and @xmath7 the beam intensity at the depth @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the linear mass attenuation coefficient which depends on the photon energy @xmath10 and the target charge @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is shown in figure  1 for a target composed of water , which is essentially equivalent to tissue .",
    "the main interaction mechanisms which contribute to @xmath13 are the photoelectric effect @xmath14 , compton scattering @xmath15 and pair - production @xmath16 . for energies typical for radioactive sources @xmath17 compton scattering dominates .",
    "the absorption profile of photons in matter exhibits a peak close to the surface followed by an exponential decay .",
    "charged particles suffer energy loss by ionisation .",
    "this energy loss is described by the bethe - bloch formula :        @xmath18    where @xmath19    [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     for protons @xmath20 interacting in water ( or tissue ) equation ( 2 ) can be approximated by @xmath21}{100 }   \\quad \\left [ \\frac{mev}{cm } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath22 which gives an energy loss of 4.2 @xmath23 for 200 @xmath3 protons at the surface and @xmath24 close to the end of their range . for heavy ions the energy loss",
    "is essentially scaled by @xmath25 .",
    "when charged particles reach the end of their range the energy loss first rises like @xmath26 but when they are very slow they capture electrons from the target material and their effective charge decreases and hence their energy loss rapidly falls to zero .",
    "a typical energy loss curve for ions as a function of their energy is sketched in figure  2 @xcite .",
    "the energy loss of @xmath27c ions as a function of the depth in water is shown in figure  3 @xcite .",
    "the tail of the energy loss beyond the bragg - peak originates from fragmentation products of @xmath27c ions , which are faster than the @xmath27c ions and have a somewhat longer range .    in the ionisation process a generally small fraction of the particle s energy is transferred to the atomic electrons . in rare cases",
    "these electrons can get a larger amount of energy .",
    "the @xmath28-electrons deviate from the main ionisation trail and produce a fuzzy - like track ( figure  4 , @xcite ) .",
    "c ) in water as a function of depth @xcite ]    -rays @xcite ]    in addition to ionisation light particles , like electrons , can also undergo bremsstrahlung @xmath29 .",
    "since the probability for this process is inversely proportional to the square of the mass of the beam particle , bremsstrahlung can be neglected for particles heavier than the electron for energies relevant to tumour therapy @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned fragmentation of heavy ions leads to the production of positron emitters . for the @xmath27c case ,",
    "lighter isotopes like @xmath30c and @xmath31c are produced . both isotopes decay with short half - lives @xmath32 ; @xmath33 to boron according to @xmath34 the positrons have a very short range , typically below @xmath35 .",
    "after coming to rest they annihilate with electrons of the tissue giving off two monochromatic photons of @xmath36 which are emitted back - to - back @xmath37 these photons can be detected by positron - emission tomography techniques and can be used to monitor the destructive effect of heavy ions on the tumour tissue .",
    "the treatment of deep seated tumours requires charged particles of typically 100 to @xmath38 per nucleon , i.e. 100 to @xmath38 protons or 1.2 to @xmath39c ions .",
    "these particles are accelerated in either a linear accelerator or in a synchrotron . as an example figure  5 shows a typical set - up for the production of heavy ions .",
    "@xmath27c atoms are evaporated from an ion source and pre - accelerated .",
    "thin foils are used to strip off all electrons from the ions .",
    "the @xmath27c nuclei are then injected into a synchrotron , where they are accelerated by radiofrequency cavities to the desired energy .",
    "the ions are kept on track by dipole bending magnets and they are focussed by quadrupoles . after having reached the final energy they are ejected by a kicker magnet , which directs the particles to the treatment room .",
    "their path is monitored by tracking        chambers ( multi - wire proportional counteres , ion chambers or drift - chambers ) .",
    "if beam losses occur veto - counters ( mostly scintillation counters ) ensure that only a pencil beam is steered to the treatment room .",
    "nowadays , mainly protons and heavy ions are used for tumour therapy .",
    "other possibilities consist of the use of negative pions @xcite , which are produced by high energy protons in a beam dump according to @xmath40 where the @xmath41 are momentum selected and collimated . after losing their energy by ionisation",
    "the negative pions are captured in the tumour tissue by nuclei at the end of their range and produce so - called ` stars ' in which neutrons are created .",
    "the bragg - peak of the negative pions along with the local production of neutrons which have a high biological effectiveness leads to an efficient cell killing in the tumour at the end of the pion s range .",
    "neutrons are also possible candidates for tumour treatment @xcite . for this purpose",
    "the tumour is sensitized by a boron compound before neutron treatment .",
    "the boron compound must be selected in such a way that it is preferentially deposited in the tumour region .",
    "neutrons are then captured by the boron according to : @xmath42 the produced @xmath43-particles ( he - nuclei ) have a very short range ( @xmath44 several @xmath45 ) and high biological effectiveness . best results are obtained with epithermal neutrons ( @xmath46 ) produced by @xmath47 protons on light targets ( e.g. be ) .    direct irradiation with neutrons  without sensitizing the tumour  has the disadvantage that neutrons show a similar dose depth curve like @xmath2co @xmath1-rays thus producing a high amount of biologically very effective damage in the healthy tissue around the tumour ( see figure 6 @xcite ) .",
    "-rays ( produced by a @xmath48 driven x - ray tube ) , @xmath49 protons , @xmath50 electrons and @xmath51ir-@xmath1-rays ( @xmath52 ) @xcite ]",
    "the target for cell killing is the dna in the cell nucleus ( see figure 7 ( after @xcite ) ) .",
    "the size of the dna - molecule compares favorably well with the width of the ionisation track of a heavy ion .",
    "the dna contains two strands containing identical information .",
    "a damage of one strand by ionising radiation can easily be repaired by copying the information from the unaffected strand to the damaged one .",
    "therefore the high ionisation density at the end of a particle s range matches well with the requirement to produce double strand breaks in the dna , which the cell will not survive .",
    "heavy ions like @xmath27c seem to be optimal for this purpose .",
    "ions heavier than carbon would even be more powerful in destroying tumour tissue , however , their energy loss in the surrounding tissue and in the entrance region already reaches a level where the fraction of irreparable damage is too high , while for lighter ions ( like @xmath27c ) mostly repairable damage is produced in the healthy tissue outside the targeted tumour .",
    "the cell killing rate in the tumour region thus benefits from two properties of protons or ions like carbon :        * the increased energy loss of protons and ions at the end of their range and * the increased biological effectiveness of double strand breaks at high ionisation density .    the cell killing rate is eventually related to the equivalent dose h in the tumour region , which can be expressed by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the tumour mass and rbe the increased relative biological effectiveness .",
    "the integral extends over the tumour region .    as mentioned above the rate and location of cell killing",
    "can be monitored by observing the annihilation photons which result from the @xmath4-decay of fragments formed by the beam .",
    "these physical and biological principles are employed in an efficient way by the raster scan technique @xcite .",
    "a pencil beam of heavy ions ( diameter @xmath55 ) is aimed at the tumour .",
    "the beam location and spread is monitored by tracking chambers with high spatial resolution . in the treatment planning the tumour",
    "is subdivided into three - dimensional pixels ( `` voxels '' ) .",
    "then the dose required to destroy the tumour , which is proportional to the beam intensity , is calculated for every voxel . for a fixed depth in tissue",
    "an areal scan is performed by magnetic deflection sweeping the beam across the area in a similar way as a tv image is produced ( see figure  8 , @xcite ) .",
    "the tumour volume is filled from the back by energy variation ( @xmath44 range variation ) of the beam .",
    "typically 50 energy steps are used starting at the rear plane . for",
    "a depth profile from @xmath56 to @xmath57 one has to cover energies from @xmath58/nucleon to @xmath59/nucleon .",
    "when the beam energy is reduced the required dose for the plane under irradiation is calculated using the damage that the more energetic beam had already produced in its entrance region .",
    "this ensures that the lateral ( caused by magnetic deflection ) and longitudinal scanning        ( by energy variation ) covers the tumour completely . in figure 9",
    "( after @xcite ) the dose distribution for individual energy settings and the resulting total dose is sketched and compared with the damage that x - rays from a @xmath2co - source would produce . an artist impression of the dose distribution for a lung and a brain tumour is given in figure 10 .",
    "berkeley was the birthplace of therapy with hadrons . since 1954",
    "protons and later helium - nuclei were used for treatment . throughout",
    "the world treatment with protons is standard ( sweden , usa , russia , japan , switzerland , england , belgium , france , south africa ) . in some places negative pions",
    "have been used in the past ( usa , canada , switzerland ) .",
    "the most promising results have been obtained with heavy ions             ( berkeley , usa ; chiba , japan ; and darmstadt , germany ) . in total @xmath44  25000 patients",
    "have been treated from 1954 to 1999 .",
    "the inverse ionisation dose profile of charged particles has been known for a long time , from nuclear and particle physics .",
    "the instrumentation originally developed for elementary particle physics experiments has made it possible to design and monitor particle beams with great precision which can then be used for tumour therapy .",
    "heavy ions seem to be ideal projectiles for tumour treatment .",
    "they are suitable for well localized tumours .",
    "the availability of treatment facilities is increasing .",
    "naturally such a facility requires an expensive and complex accelerator for the charged particles . for beam steering and control sophisticated particle detectors and interlock systems are necessary to ensure the safety of patients .",
