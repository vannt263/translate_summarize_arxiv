    "the galactic centre ( hereafter gc ) region is an important place for many reasons . a supermassive black hole exists in the direction of sgr  a@xmath6 within a complex region involving both hot and cold gas ( e.g.  @xcite ; genzel , eisenhauer & gillessen , 2010 ) .",
    "this region hosts the highest density of stars in the galaxy , and furthermore various stellar populations co - exist with different distribution and characteristics ( launhardt , zylka & mezger , 2002 ) .",
    "first , the extended bulge with a scale of a few kilo - parsecs has a triaxial or bar - like shape ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and is populated predominantly by old stars ( @xmath7  gyr , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the nuclear bulge show a disk - like distribution with a radius @xmath8  parsecs , and a significant population of young stars ( a few myr ) are found in this region ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . finally , a dense stellar cluster with numerous massive stars exist within a radius @xmath9  parsecs ( its core radius actually is much smaller , @xmath10  parsec ) around the central black hole @xcite .",
    "the gc region provides us with a unique opportunity to study not only stellar evolution but also phenomena in central parts of galaxies at close hand ( @xmath11  kpc ) .",
    "for instance , the most populous group of known young and massive stars , such as o - type stars and wolf - rayet stars , within the galaxy exists there ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "pulsating variable stars are useful in studies of stellar populations . in particular , cepheids play important roles in a wide range of astronomy .",
    "there are two groups of cepheids , i.e.  classical cepheids ( hereafter cceps ) and type ii cepheids ( t2cs ) .",
    "both of them have period - luminosity relation ( plr ) , but the luminosities at a given period differ by 1.52  mag ( @xcite ; matsunaga , feast & soszyski , @xcite ) .",
    "cceps are pulsating supergiants with periods typically between 3 and 50  d , evolved from intermediate- to high - mass stars ( 410  @xmath12 ) .",
    "on the other hand , t2cs have similar periods to cceps , but are old and evolved from low - mass stars , @xmath13 .",
    "t2cs are conventionally subdivided into the bl  her and w  vir stars at periods less than 20 days and the rv  tau stars with greater periods .",
    "in addition , @xcite identified peculiar w  vir stars which tend to be brighter than the plr and to often show light curves with eclipsing or ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "there remain uncertainties in the properties and the evolution of t2cs ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "a serious difficulty in studying the stars towards the gc lies in observing them beyond the severe interstellar extinction .",
    "the foreground extinction is not uniform and strong ( around 23  mag in the @xmath14 band , @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus , infrared observations are required in order to study stars in the gc region .",
    "in fact long - term infrared observations have made it possible to monitor stellar motions around the central black hole ( @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these and other data were used to search for variable stars in the few parsec ( or smaller ) region around sgr  a@xmath6 ( @xcite ; ott , eckart & genzel , 1999 ; peeples , stanek & depoy , 2007 ; @xcite ) . however , no cepheids were found in these works .",
    "we carried out near - ir observations to investigate stellar variability in the gc region .",
    "our survey covered a much wider area , @xmath1 , than the previous monitoring observations .",
    "a large number of long - period variables including miras were found in the survey region ( @xcite  @xcite , = paper  i ) , and we discovered three cceps , the first of this type in the gc region ( @xcite  @xcite , = paper  ii ) . in the present paper",
    "we describe our data analysis and a catalogue of the short period variables in the field , and also discuss their nature as well as the distance to the gc .",
    "observations were conducted using the irsf 1.4  m telescope and the sirius camera ( @xcite ; @xcite ) which collects images in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands , simultaneously . the observed field composed of 12 fields - of - view of irsf / sirius covered @xmath1 around the gc ( table  [ tab : fields ] ) .",
    "observations at about 90 epochs were made between 2001 and 2008 of which the majority were obtained in 2005 and 2006 .",

    "[ fig : phistt2c ] .",
    "most of our sample have long periods ( @xmath19  d ) .",
    "this bias is caused by the detection limit of our survey as mentioned above .",
    "in contrast , with more than 300 t2cs , the ogle - iii sample clearly shows the distinct groups of bl  her , w  vir , rv  tau stars .",
    "such a feature is well seen in the t2c samples of the magellanic clouds but not in that of globular clusters ( see fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , there are significantly more w  vir stars than rv  tau stars and the periods of w  vir stars show a broad , or even two distinct , peak(s ) , both of which are similar to the case of the lmc t2cs .",
    "the number of bl  her stars is even larger than w  vir stars , i.e.  @xmath20 ( error from poisson noise ) .",
    "this ratio falls between the case of the lmc ( 1.25 ) and the smc ( 0.6 ) given in @xcite .",
    "the reason for these variations in the t2c populations is presumably related to age and/or metallicity , but the lack of theoretical models for t2cs prevents us from further discussion .    ]",
    "it is of interest to examine the surface density of t2cs in the bulge .",
    "we detected 11 t2cs with @xmath21  d , which leads to the density of 66  deg@xmath22 considering the area of our survey towards the gc ( 1/6  deg@xmath22 ) .",
    "however , our survey was not complete even for the relatively long - period t2cs because of thick dark nebulae ( fig .",

    "we consider only the fields in the range of @xmath23 and @xmath24 where the density is high enough . the profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_t2c ] shows , in effect , the variation along the minor axis .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : density_mira ] shows a similar plot of the density profile for miras .",
    "@xcite found 547 miras with period determined in the same irsf survey field , among which 251 objects have periods less than 350  d. whilst the miras have a broad range of age ( from @xmath9  gyr to 1  gyr or even younger ) , such short - period miras are found in globular clusters @xcite and considered to belong to the old stellar population .",
    "the number of the short - period miras towards the gc field corresponds to a surface density of 2200  deg@xmath22 .",
    "the surface densities for the outer region were obtained using the catalogue of the ogle - ii miras compiled by matsunaga , fukushi & nakada  ( 2005 ) . in fig .  [ fig : density_mira ] , the density profile for the ogle - ii miras is well represented by the exponential law , @xmath25 .",

    "note that the exponential and the de voucouleurs law correspond to the sersic law with @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "in contrast , the lower limit inferred by our sample is higher than the exponential law predicted by the ogle - ii miras .",
    "this excess agrees with the idea that an additional population of miras exist in the nuclear bulge , the disk - like system within @xmath8  pc .",

    "we concentrate on data obtained in the areas close to the centre which should be free of any such effects .",
    "in view of the importance of reddening in this region we use a reddening free plr in @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 where the coefficient is taken from the extinction law found by @xcite . as a preliminary",

    "we now concentrate on our t2cs , which are in the vicinity of the gc , and whose periods fall within the range of w  vir stars .",

    "we obtained the average modulus of @xmath38  mag , based on 5 w  vir stars ( @xmath39  d ) excluding # 26 , under the assumption of @xmath40  mag .",
    "the errors in the above estimates account just for statistical errors , and we need to consider systematic uncertainties .",
    "our estimates are affected by errors in the extinction law and the lmc distance as well as the possible population effect on the plr .",
    "we adopt an uncertainty of 0.05  mag for the lmc modulus and 0.07  mag for the adopted reddening law as we did in paper  i for the gc miras",

    "nevertheless , to be conservative we adopt an uncertainty of 0.07  mag for this . considering these errors and the above estimates , the current sample of t2cs results in an estimate of the gc distance modulus to be @xmath41  mag .",
    "there is a further uncertainty due , as discussed above , to our detection limit .",

    "adopted @xmath47 and @xmath48 from theoretical isochrones by ( bonatto , bica & girardi , 2004 ) , whereas @xcite obtained @xmath49 and @xmath50 . using this new calibration leads to @xmath51  mag , that is @xmath52  kpc , without any population effect taken into account .",
    "there is a large scatter in metallicities of red clump giants in the bulge and the median metallicity seems slightly higher than the solar abundance @xcite .",
    "the error , adopted from @xcite , includes and is affected by the uncertainty of a possible population effect .",
    "these estimates based on near - ir data of stellar distance indicators in areas close to the centre are compared with the results from kinematic methods in fig .",

    "these latter methods are : the kepler rotation of the star s2 around sgr  a@xmath6 @xcite , the statistical parallax method applied to the central stellar cluster @xcite and the parallax of sgr  b @xcite .",
    "the photometric and kinematic determinations are in satisfactory agreement and indicate a value of @xmath4 , close to 8.0  kpc .",
    "the uncertainty in the reddening law is the dominant remaining error for the photometric distances discussed here .",

    ", the nishiyama value of @xmath54 is 2.5  mag whereas the @xcite law gives 3.2  mag and would lead to an unacceptably small value of @xmath4(gc ) .     to the gc based on various methods ( see the text for references ) .",

    "[ fig : gcdms ] ]",
    "through our near - ir survey of stellar variability towards the gc , 45 short - period variables have been discovered .",
    "their light curves are investigated to determine the variable types , and for the cepheid candidates their distances and foreground extinctions are also considered based on the plrs .",
    "most of the objects are reasonably classified : three cceps , 16 t2cs , 24 eclipsing binaries , and two others .",
    "the numbers of t2cs and short - period miras in our survey region are higher than the surface density following the exponential law which fits the distribution of t2cs and miras in the outer bulge .",
    "this strongly suggests that the nuclear bulge hosts a significant population of old stars ( @xmath7  gyr ) .",
    "we also discuss the distance to the galactic centre based on stellar distance indicators in the central region .",
    "these are insensitive to problems associated with the three dimensional structure of the bulge which may affect other determinations .",
    "our main result is close to 8  kpc and agrees well with kinematic estimates . since the photometric results are rather sensitive to the infrared reddening law , the result give support to the reddening law of @xcite which we adopted .",
