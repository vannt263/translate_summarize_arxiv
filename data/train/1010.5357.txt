    "the theoretical proposal and experimental discovery of topological band insulators @xcite ( ti ) has been raising increasing interest in the condensed matter physics community . these materials",
    "form a novel topological state of matter , which does not fall into the standard classification of broken symmetries . instead , what distinguishes this phase from a trivial band insulator ( bi ) is the existence of a nontrivial 2 topological index associated with the full band structure .",
    "this distinction is somewhat analogous to the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) , whose distinguished states can be attributed to a 1 topological index associated with full landau levels of noninteracting electrons .",
    "broken symmetry phases are characterized by local order parameters , in what is known as the landau paradigm @xcite .",
    "it is commonly accepted that this paradigm does not apply to the above topological phases . instead",
    ", such phases are described by the more elusive quantity , known as a topological order @xcite .    in iqhe",
    "the quantized hall conductance is a direct manifestation of the topological order , and for the case of free electrons , this response function is a local bulk quantity @xcite . as far as we know , for ti the implication of the topological order is only through edge effects ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) or defect - related effects @xcite . there is no local response function that is known to characterizes this 2 phase , let alone an order parameter .    in this work",
    "we show that both the 2 index of the ti and the 1 index of the iqhe , as well as any gapped insulator with non - zero chern number @xmath2 , can be extracted from a local equal time ground - state correlation function .",
    "this implies that _ in these systems the topological order is in fact a local ground state property_. it also proves a bulk - edge correspondence theorem for such local topological orders .    when interactions are taken into account , the 1 index remains well defined @xcite , while it is yet unclear whether the 2 index does @xcite .",
    "our formulation , however , remains well defined at least for weak interactions , and thus suggests an extension to the definition of the ti to weakly interacting systems . beyond weak interactions , we show that either the energy gap or some  occupation gap \" must be closed during the transition from a ti to a bi .    the theoretical procedure that we provide can be straightforwardly adapted to form an algorithm for numerically determining the 2 and 1 indices .",
    "this algorithm is rather efficient , since one only needs to diagonalize several matrices with dimensions of the order of the correlation length squared ( 2d ) or cubed ( 3d ) .",
    "such an algorithm may help in numerically testing a predicted topological order .",
    "our procedure of extracting the topological index deals with noninteracting lattice - based band insulators .",
    "the required input is the equal time ground - state two - point correlation function @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the many body ground state , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron in site @xmath7 ( for brevity we let @xmath7 encompass also the orbital and spin degrees of freedom ) . for noninteracting electrons",
    "the two - point correlation function coincides with the single - particle spectral projector @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the single - particle wave function associated with @xmath5 , @xmath10 is an eigenstate of the single - particle hamiltonian with an energy @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the chemical potential . since we are interested in local bulk properties , we assume that the sites @xmath7 and @xmath13 reside within the bulk .    in the following ( see property i below ) we show that @xmath14 is exponentially local , namely it decays exponentially with the distance between @xmath7 and @xmath13 within some correlation length @xmath15 and has only an exponentially small dependence on details of the hamiltonian outside a local region around @xmath7 and @xmath13 .",
    "this locality allows us to discuss @xmath14 within some given @xmath16 , without concerning ourselves with details of the edges of the region , boundary conditions , or the hamiltonian outside @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , for any geometry of @xmath16 , we can always consider a subregion with a geometry of a corbino disk , or a thick torus ( corbino donut ) in 3d , which we assume to have circumferences larger than @xmath15",
    ".    given @xmath17 on such a region , we multiply @xmath14 by a geometric phase factor , in a way that we call `` artificial flux insertion '' @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 $ ] is the azimuthal angle from site @xmath7 to site @xmath13 . in the proceeding",
    "we assume for convenience that in 2d @xmath16 is of the topologically equivalent cylindrical geometry .",
    "a key analytical result in this work ( property ii ) is that eq .",
    "( [ eq : pofphi ] ) captures the effect of real magnetic flux insertion , up to @xmath21 corrections , where @xmath22 is the inner circumference of the corbino disk ( or donut ) .",
    "hence the inclusion of flux is merely a transformation of @xmath17 , which yields no extra information in addition to the information already contained in @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the next step is to construct 1d wannier functions out of @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the position operator along the open coordinate @xmath24 .",
    "we define the 1d wannier functions @xmath25 to be the eigenstates of the projected position operator in a given flux @xcite",
    "@xmath26    this definition of the wannier functions has several advantages .",
    "first , it relies on @xmath17 rather than the bloch wave functions , hence the eigenvalues @xmath27 are unaffected by the phase freedom in fourier space , on the one hand , and it remains defined in the presence of disorder , on the other hand .",
    "second , since @xmath28 is a continuous function of @xmath29 , the @xmath30 s are also continuous in @xmath29 .",
    "third , in time - reversal - preserving systems @xmath31 is a time - reversal - invariant operator for @xmath32 , and thus kramers theorem assures that the wannier functions come in time - reversal pairs with doubly degenerate eigenvalues at these points .",
    "last , we prove below ( property iii ) that within the bulk each wannier function is exponentially localized around its eigenvalue along @xmath24 , even for cases of nontrivial chern number .",
    "this implies that the @xmath30 s of the wannier functions that reside within the middle of the region @xmath16 are unaffected by details of the system out of @xmath16 or by the edges of @xmath16 .",
    "so far we have shown that given @xmath33 in a local region @xmath16 , one has sufficient data to extract @xmath34 . in order to extract the 2 index out of the @xmath35 s",
    ", we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and consider the pairs of eigenvalues at @xmath36 and @xmath37 . as mentioned before , at these fluxes",
    "the @xmath30 s come in degenerate pairs .",
    "the difference between a bi and a ti is whether the pairs at @xmath36 are the same as those at @xmath37 ( bi ) or not ( ti ) , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : switching ] .",
    "the 1 index is even simpler to extract , since there is no degeneracy in the @xmath30 s , and all the 1d wannier functions move in the same direction @xcite . according to gauge invariance , the eigenvalues at @xmath36 are the same as those at @xmath38 , but",
    "each @xmath30 may be carried with the flux to @xmath39 . if the labeling of the eigenvalues is such that @xmath40 , then the 1 index equals to @xmath41 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_index ] .    the four 2 indices of the 3d ti @xmath42 can be extracted by generalizing the pair switching criterion @xcite . given a sample with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the wannier centers are carried with two independent fluxes @xmath45 , where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) corresponds to the phase twist in @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "now @xmath48 if the pairs switch partners between @xmath49 and @xmath50 and , accordingly , @xmath51 for switching between @xmath52 and @xmath50 .",
    "if the pair switching in the course @xmath53 differs from that in @xmath54 , then @xmath55 . in order to extract @xmath56 we must have @xmath17 also in a geometry that is periodic in @xmath24 and @xmath43 .",
    "we can see that in 3d ti the geometry on which @xmath17 is given plays an important role .",
    "the 3d generalization of the 2d cylinder is periodic boundary conditions in two directions , while the 3d generalization of the corbino disk is the corbino donut .",
    "the corbino donut can be isolated from any given sample by discarding sites from the projector , and therefore properties inferred from these geometries must be local and isotropic .",
    "on the contrary , the 3d cylinder can not be isolated form larger samples , and therefore properties inferred from this geometry need not be local nor isotropic . in the corbino donut",
    "we consider only the flux that resides inside the donut , and @xmath23 denotes the open radial coordinate .",
    "for @xmath55 we expect pair switching , since gapless states will appear at the surface @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "since a corbino donut can be isolated from a larger sample in any orientation , it is impossible to extract from it the orientation - dependent weak indices .    in the presence of interactions , the ground - state two - point correlation function remains well defined .",
    "however , it no longer corresponds to a projection matrix , which is the requested input to the process .",
    "prior to the addition of interactions all the eigenvalues of the correlation function were either 0 or 1 , corresponding to occupied and unoccupied states .",
    "one can think of this as an occupation gap of exactly @xmath57 .",
    "as interactions are gradually increased , and as long as there is no phase transition , the correlation function is expected to change continuously , and the occupation gap to remain finite . provided that , it is possible to extract a truncated projector out of the correlation function in a way which is independent of the truncation process , as will be proven below .    in general , locality of topological",
    "order implies a bulk - edge correspondence theorem , provided that the topological order is well defined for insulating phases .",
    "assume that two samples which belong to two different classes are attached .",
    "if the entire system remains gapped , it belongs to a single topological class .",
    "however , according to the locality of the order , the system seems to belong to two classes simultaneously .",
    "this contradiction implies a closure of the gap , which can only take place at the interface . in the other way , if the gap can remain open between the two attached samples , the classifying order must be nonlocal .",
    "for example , weak topological insulators may have a gapped surface ( in a stacking direction ) @xcite , which means that the weak order is nonlocal , in agreement to what has been stated above .",

    "however , due to finite size effect , some of the eigenstates of @xmath58 would be localized near the edges of the region @xmath16 .",
    "these eigenstates are edge dependent and , therefore , do not reflect the physical behavior of the bulk .",
    "fortunately , due to the exponential localization of the eigenstates , one can easily distinguish these state from the bulk eigenstates and discard them , as proven in the appendix .",
    "we have carried out this process on the 2d kane and mele model of the ti @xcite in the presence of disorder .",

    "one should relate the upper state before the crossing to the upper state after the crossing and the same for the lower .",
    "this process is equivalent to opening a gap at the crossing point by some small local perturbation .",
    "moreover , due to winger noncrossing theorem @xcite , this gap is probably there , only it is not visible within the numerical accuracy .",
    "now we turn to prove the three properties that have been stated above .",
    "the band insulator lattice hamiltonian @xmath82 is characterized by a spectrum with a finite gap @xmath83 around some value @xmath12 , and a maximal energy in absolute value @xmath84 above @xmath12 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath82 does not couple two sites which are more than @xmath85 sites apart .",
    "since we are interested in bulk properties , we assume that the periodic dimensions of the lattice are of finite size @xmath22 , while the open coordinate is infinite ( finite size systems are discussed in the appendix ) .    the starting point of the proofs is to develop a representation of the projector @xmath17 as a finite polynomial in @xmath82 .",
