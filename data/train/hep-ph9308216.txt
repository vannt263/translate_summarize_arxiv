    "<S> single - lepton plus jets signals from @xmath0 production at hadron colliders generally give more spherically symmetrical events than the principal backgrounds from @xmath1 production . </S>",
    "<S> we show that sphericity and aplanarity criteria , applied to lepton plus neutrino plus four jet final states at the fermilab tevatron @xmath2 collider , help to discriminate ; they can be used either to validate an eventual top signal or simply to reduce background . </S>",

    "<S> the predicted top quark , an essential component of the standard model ( sm ) , is apparently too heavy to have been discovered yet at high energy colliders ; the present experimental limit is @xmath10  gev from the cdf detector  @xcite and independently @xmath11  gev from the d0 detector  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency of radiative corrections to all electroweak data however indicates that @xmath12  gev  @xcite , and hence that the top quark can probably be discovered at the fermilab tevatron @xmath2 collider sooner or later  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the sm predicts mainly @xmath0 pair production via qcd with @xmath13 decays ; the smallest and cleanest signals are expected in two - lepton channels  @xcite , but larger single - lepton  @xcite and all - jet  @xcite signals can also in principle be separated from backgrounds . since the top signals will initially ( and perhaps for a considerable time ) be based on a small number of events , it will be important to suppress the backgrounds as far as possible in ways that do not seriously reduce the signals . in this note </S>",
    "<S> we propose the use of event - shape criteria to distinguish the top signal and reduce backgrounds in the relatively copious single - lepton - plus-4jet channel .    </S>",
    "<S> the underlying idea is that tevatron @xmath0 production will be mainly near threshold in the cm frame of the lowest - order qcd subprocesses @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and hence will mostly lead to rather spherical event shapes in this frame . </S>",
    "<S> phase - space factors favor spherical configurations ; the @xmath0 spin correlations  @xcite and decay matrix elements introduce substructure but do not drastically change this spherical tendency , which can help to distinguish the signal from backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> this idea is very familiar in the context of heavy quark searches at @xmath16 colliders and has recently been applied to 6-jet top signals at the tevatron  @xcite ; we propose here to apply it to lepton - neutrino-4jet signals from @xmath17 decays ( where the neutrino is partially measured via transverse energy balance ) . backgrounds in this channel from @xmath18- and @xmath19-quark semileptonic decays can be removed by lepton @xmath20 and isolation cuts  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the major background then comes from @xmath1 production plus 4 qcd jets , which remains comparable with the signal after all the usual cuts on transverse momenta @xmath20 , pseudo - rapidities @xmath21 , and missing transverse energy @xmath22  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; we neglect contributions from @xmath23 or @xmath24 plus 2 qcd jets  @xcite that are an order of magnitude smaller . </S>",
    "<S> this background can be further suppressed by requiring a @xmath18-jet - tag , costing the signal a tagging - efficiency factor of order 0.3 at present  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we may expect the inherent collinear singularities to cause spatial correlations of qcd jets with each other and with the beam axis , giving less spherical configurations and hence a discrimination between background and signal via an appropriate choice of event - shape variable as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> first we restrict ourselves to momenta in the transverse plane , in order to use the most direct neutrino information contained in its transverse momentum defined by @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the usual  circularity \" event shape variable @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 summed over the lepton , neutrino , and 4  jet transverse momenta and minimized with respect to the choice of the unit vector @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this quadratic variable is unstable against the splitting or combining of jets ; although @xmath26 is well defined for any given jet algorithm , it would be theoretically preferable to use a linearized variable such as @xmath29 both @xmath26 and @xmath30 are normalized to 1 for an ideal circular event and vanish for a linear configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider event shapes in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal neutrino momentum @xmath31 is not measured ; it can be inferred approximately by requiring that the lepton - neutrino invariant mass @xmath32 , but this leaves a two - fold ambiguity . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the solution that allows the most consistent @xmath0 reconstruction ( details below ) and form the conventional normalized @xmath33 momentum tensor @xmath34 from the lepton plus neutrino plus 4jet momenta @xmath35 , in the cm frame of these momenta . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 has three eigenvalues @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; the sphericity @xmath40 and aplanarity @xmath41 are then defined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> ( it would be theoretically preferable to use linearized variables such as thrust and acoplanarity , but for ease of computation we use @xmath40 and @xmath41 here ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath44 for ideal spherical events , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for plane circular events , and @xmath47 for linear events . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect the tevatron top signal to give typically larger @xmath48 and @xmath41 than the @xmath49jets background , and have made quantitative parton - level calculations at @xmath50  tev to confirm this .    for illustration </S>",
    "<S> we compute the @xmath51 production and decay distributions in lowest order with full spin correlation effects  @xcite , using the mrs set @xmath52 parton distributions of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite evaluated at scale @xmath53 , neglecting possible additional qcd jets and taking @xmath54jet final states . </S>",
    "<S> the total @xmath0 production rate is normalized conservatively to the central value of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , although values about 20% higher have recently been proposed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the @xmath55jet background from the full tree - level matrix elements following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , evaluating the parton distributions at scale @xmath56 in accord with tevatron results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we sum lepton flavors and charges @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate calorimeter errors by gaussian uncertainties on jet and lepton energies , following the cdf values tabulated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and calculate the apparent neutrino @xmath20 from overall @xmath58 imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> we impose the following acceptance cuts on transverse momenta , pseudorapidities , and jet multiplicity @xmath59 , selecting regions where the top signal should be strong , @xmath60 we also set minimum jet - jet and lepton - jet separations @xmath61 where @xmath62 , to mimic some effects of jet - finding algorithms and lepton isolation cuts  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that these @xmath63 cuts already introduce some event - shape discrimination .    </S>",
    "<S> we first compare the shapes of the @xmath48 and @xmath41 distributions for @xmath0 signal and @xmath64  jets background , for the case @xmath65  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the means @xmath66 and standard deviations @xmath67 for the signal ( background ) are @xmath68 from which we see that the circularity variables offer little discrimination in this case , whereas the @xmath40 and @xmath41 variables show appreciable displacements between signal and background . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath40 and @xmath41 distributions are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s , a dist ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the signal has significantly different distributions from the background , expecially for @xmath41 ; this could help to validate an eventual top signal ( extracted by @xmath18-tagging say ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , cutting out events below a minimum value @xmath69 or @xmath70 would reduce the background more than the signal ; integrated cross sections for @xmath71 and @xmath72 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma min ] . </S>",
    "<S> we shall illustrate below the effects of a choice @xmath73 ( not specifically optimized ) , similar to cuts suggested for all - jet signals  @xcite ; this reduces the signal ( background ) by 15% ( 36% ) , giving a cleaner result and an increase in its statistical significance ( signal)/@xmath74 .    to extract a top quark mass peak , we introduce a constrained event parameterization as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we first compute the two solutions for @xmath31 by requiring @xmath32 ; if they are formally complex , we set the imaginary parts to zero , getting the single nearest - to - onshell solution . </S>",
    "<S> we then select the pair of jets with invariant mass closest to @xmath75 , and identify them as the @xmath76 decay candidates . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining two jets are candidates for @xmath18 and @xmath77 jets , if this is a @xmath0 event . from the four possible ways of pairing the latter two jets with our unique @xmath76 choice and the two - fold @xmath78 solution , we select </S>",
    "<S> whichever pairing gives the closest agreement between the resultant @xmath79 invariant masses . </S>",
    "<S> the mean of these two closest @xmath80 values is defined as the reconstructed top mass @xmath81 ( following the notation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) ; taking the mean gives a narrower signal peak than either the semileptonic or the hadronic @xmath80 value separately . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath81 variable differs from those proposed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ tilde m ] presents the calculated @xmath81 distribution for signal and background , for @xmath82 , 150 , and 170  gev , first with the standard acceptance cuts of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ accept])([sep ] ) ( upper curves ) , and also with the additional event - shape cuts @xmath83 ( lower curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> hadronization effects have not been included , except in their contributions to calorimeter resolution ; we expect they will somewhat further smear the @xmath81 peak .    </S>",
    "<S> our results show that    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 and @xmath41 distributions of top signals differ significantly from background in the lepton + neutrino + 4jets channel ; 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> these differences could help to validate an eventual top signal or alternatively reduce background and improve significance ; 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the signal would peak in our reconstructed top mass variable @xmath81 .    </S>",
