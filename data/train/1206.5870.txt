    "the formation and the condensation of the cooper pairs are the essence of superconductivity and superfluidity in many - fermion systems@xcite .",
    "the binding energy of the cooper pair is closely related to the pairing gap @xmath3 .",
    "the spatial size of the cooper pair is identified to the coherence length @xmath4 of the superconductors , which plays important roles in many aspects , for instance , in distinguishing the type i and type ii superconductors . what is the size of the cooper pair in the superfluidity of nuclear systems ?",
    "a simple estimate of the coherence length @xmath4 , based on the uncertainty principle in uniform matter , leads to @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the fermi velocity@xcite .",
    "if one considers saturated nuclear matter as a simplification of finite nuclei , and adopts the typical value of the pairing gap @xmath7 mev appropriate for heavy nuclei , the estimate gives @xmath8 fm which is much larger@xcite than the radius of nuclei @xmath9 fm or interparticle distance @xmath10 fm in saturated matter .",
    "however , if one considers extreme situations , such as dilute neutron matter and exotic nuclei with large neutron excess , there appear new features of the nuclear pairing that can be related to the spatial structure of the cooper pair .",
    "it is the aim of this article to illustrate it using a few examples .",
    "the superfluidity in neutron matter is density dependent@xcite .",
    "the pairing gap can be obtained by solving the bcs equations for the bare nuclear force in the @xmath11 channel at each neutron density @xmath12 or the fermi momentum @xmath13 . the gap is small @xmath14 mev at @xmath15 @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , the neutron density at saturation @xmath18 @xmath19 )",
    ". with decreasing the density it first increases , reaching the maximum @xmath20 mev around @xmath21 @xmath16 ( @xmath22 ) , then decreases and approaches to zero at the low - density limit .",
    "other many - body medium effects which are beyond the bcs approximation reduce the gap , but the predictions vary depending on the theoretical methods@xcite .",
    "recent ab initio monte carlo calculations@xcite , on the other hand , predict rather modest reduction by less than 50% , and the qualitative features of the density dependence is kept .",
    "having these reservations in mind , let us consider the structure of the neutron cooper pair in the bcs approximation.@xcite    the cooper pair wave function can be defined , apart from the normalization , as an expectation value of the pair operator with respect to the bcs state : @xmath23 it is a function of the relative coordinate @xmath24 of the two neutrons , and in the momentum space it is a product of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 factors . examples of the cooper pair wave functions are shown in fig . 1 for two different densities@xcite .",
    "the wave function exhibits an oscillatory behavior characterized by the fermi wave length @xmath27 and an overall decay profile whose asymptotic form is exponential @xmath28 ( for large relative distance @xmath29 ) whose length scale is nothing but the coherence length , or the size of the cooper paper@xcite .",
    "more precisely , the coherence length can be calculated as the rms radius of the cooper pair @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "an interesting feature of the neutron cooper pair in superfluid neutron matter is that its size also varies significantly with changing the neutron density ( see fig.1(a ) ) . from a very large value @xmath32 fm at @xmath17 ,",
    "the coherence length @xmath4 decreases sharply with decreasing the density .",
    "the coherence length takes the smallest values @xmath33 fm for a rather wide range of the density @xmath34 , and it increases gradually with decreasing the density .",
    "the cooper pair wave function at densities where the coherence length is the smallest is very different from that of of the electron cooper pair in the traditional metal superconductors .",
    "an example is shown in fig.1 ( c ) , which is for @xmath35 where the coherence length @xmath36 fm is close to the minimum value .",
    "it is seen that the oscillatory behavior is strongly suppressed .",
    "the probability distribution is concentrated ( @xmath37 ) at small relative distances within the first node @xmath38 fm , and the probability at the second and third bumps is very small .",
    "this is because the size of the cooper pair ( @xmath36 fm ) is almost equal to the position of the first node @xmath39 which is nothing but the average interparticle distance @xmath40 .",
    "the size of the cooper pair is `` small '' in this sense .",
    "this is quite contrasting to the metal superconducters where the cooper pair size @xmath4 is thousands times larger than the average interparticle distance @xmath41 .",
    "the situation of the `` small '' cooper pair @xmath42 is seen in a wide interval of densities @xmath43 ( fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "the shape of the cooper pair wave function at these densities is similar to that of fig.1(c ) , and the probability is even more concentrated in the first bump although the absolute size is larger at very low densities @xmath44 .",
    "it is noted that the cooper pair at moderate low densities @xmath45 exhibits also the strong spatial correlation at small relative distances . the wave function at @xmath46 is shown in fig.1(b ) . in this case",
    "the calculated coherence length @xmath47 fm is a few times larger than the average interparticle distance @xmath48 fm .",
    "nevertheless the concentration of the probability within the relative distance @xmath2 fm ( in the first bump ) is signfinicant , and the probability in @xmath49 fm reaches as large as @xmath50 .    the situation of the small cooper pair @xmath51 is related to the so - called bcs - bec crossover phenomenon@xcite , which has been discussed intensively in ultra - cold fermi atom gas in a trap@xcite .",
    "it is a phenomenon which can occur generally in any kind of many - fermion superfuluid systems by changing the strength of the interparticle attractive force or the density . in a situation of the weak interaction , which the original bcs theory has dealt with , the bound pair ( the cooper pair )",
    "can be formed only in the medium . however ,",
    "if the interaction is as strong as to form a bound pair ( a composite boson ) even in the free space , the condensed phase is more close to a condensate of the composite bosons , i.e. the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover is characterized by the ratio @xmath52 of the coherence length and the average interparticle distance and the ratio @xmath53 of the pairing gap and the fermi energy .",
    "the weak - coupling bcs and the bec limits correspond to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively while the region of the crossover may be related to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite at the midway of the crossover , called the unitarity limit , the interaction strength is on the threshold to form the isolated two - particle bound state , and the values are @xmath58 . in the bcs calculation discussed above@xcite , small @xmath52 ratio @xmath59 and large @xmath53 ratio @xmath60 is realized at @xmath61 .",
    "( note that also in an ab initio calculation@xcite , the large gap ratio @xmath62 is obtained in approximately the same but slightly small density region . )",
    "we can regard dilute neutron matter in the wide low - density interval @xmath63 ( or in slightly narrower interval ) as being in the crossover region .",
    "we note here that the nuclear force in the @xmath11 channel has a large scattering length @xmath64 fm , indicating that the interaction strength is very close to the threshold to form a two - neutron bound state .",
    "the small cooper pair @xmath51 at low densities originates from the nature of the nuclear force .",
    "the spatial structure of the correlated two neutrons has been discussed intensively for two neutrons in the light two - neutron halo nuclei @xmath65li and @xmath66he in ( inert or active ) core plus two neutron models @xcite .",
    "a common prediction is that the valence halo neutrons exhibit a spatial correlation favoring the di - neutron configuration with two neutrons coupled at small relative distances .",
    "the spatial correlation is also discussed in stable heavy nuclei with closed - shell core plus two neutrons , e.g. @xmath67pb , by means of shell model approaches.@xcite one can generalize these findings by using the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method , which can be applied to a wide class of open shell nuclei including isotopes very close to the drip - line and also to non - uniform matter .",
    "let us start defining the wave function of the cooper pair in finite nuclei .",
    "it may be given by @xmath68 using the pair correlated ground states @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this represents the probability amplitude of removing two neutrons ( positioned at @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) from the ground state @xmath69 , and leaving the remaining system in the ground state @xmath70 .",
    "provided that the ground state is described within the hfb framework , where the ground states with different nucleon numbers are represented by a single hfb state @xmath73 , the definition eq.([eq.finite ] ) can be replaced with the expectation value as in eq.([eq.matter ] ) .",
    "then , since the hfb state is a generalized slater determinant consisting of the bogolviubov quasiparticle states , this quantity is evaluated@xcite as a sum over all quasiparticle states @xmath74 @xmath75 using the first and the second components of the quasiparticle wave function @xmath76 . in the following",
    "we show the results of our hfb calculation , which adopts the skryme functional and the density - dependent contact interaction as a phenomenological pairing force@xcite .",
    "the parameter set of the pairing interaction is such that it reproduces the scattering length @xmath64 fm in the low - density limit , and reproduces the average pairing gap in known nuclei@xcite .",
    "an example calculated for @xmath77sn is shown in fig.2 . here",
    "one neutron is fixed at the position slightly outside the nucleus @xmath78 fm and the probability distribution @xmath79 is plotted as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "it shows that the second neutron has a large probability ( @xmath50 ) to be correlated at small relative distances @xmath80 fm to the partner neutron .",
    "the spatial correlation seen here is generic in a sense that it is seen systematically in ca , ni , and sn isotopes including both stable and neutron - rich nuclei@xcite .",
    "the strong spatial correlation is also seen in other hfb calculations which adopt the finite - range gogny force as the effective pairing force.@xcite    i emphasize here that a large single - particle space is necessary in describing the spatial correlation@xcite . in order to describe the correlation with the length scale @xmath81 fm , the single - particle basis needs to cover a momentum range up to @xmath82 , which corresponds to a maximal energy @xmath83 mev , or a maximal angular momentum @xmath84 ( for the nuclear radius @xmath85 fm ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.2(right ) , where the summation over the quasiparticle states @xmath74 in eq.([eq.finite2 ] ) is truncated by introducing a cut - off with respect to the orbital angular momentum @xmath86 .",
    "single - particle orbits with large angular momentum up to @xmath87 have sizable contributions .",
    "note that in @xmath77sn with @xmath88 the fermi energy is around the @xmath89 orbit , and the maximal orbital angular momentum of the orbits occupied in the independent particle limit is @xmath90 .",
    "the single - particle states with @xmath91 lie high above the fermi energy .",
    "if one uses the harmonic oscillator basis , it should include @xmath92 10 oscillator quanta .",
    "in fact , all the hfb calculations@xcite where the strong spatial correlation in the cooper pair wave functions is demonstrated adopt such a large single - particle space .",
    "equivalently , a small single - particle space is insufficient .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to a single-@xmath93 shell @xmath94 , i.e. , the sum in eq.([eq.finite2 ] ) is restricted to the magnetic substates of the orbit @xmath94 , we obtain the angular correlation@xcite @xmath95 for small relative angles @xmath96 , but the correlation with respect to the radial direction is not produced .",
    "inclusion of all the orbits in one oscillator shell still has deficiency@xcite .",
    "the cooper pair wave function in this case exhibits an artificial symmetry @xmath97 because of the common single - particle parity , and the probability appears not only around @xmath98 , but also around the mirror reflected position @xmath99 .",
    "the spatial correlation of neutron cooper pairs plays an important role if we consider neutron - rich nuclei with small neutron separation energy .",
    "nuclei of this kind often accompany low - density distribution of neutrons , called skin or halo , extending from the nuclear surface toward the outside .",
    "figure 3(a ) is an example of the pair potential @xmath100 for the very neutron rich nucleus @xmath77sn obtained in the same skyrme - hfb calculation as in fig.2 .",
    "the pair potential @xmath100 exhibits significant enhancement around @xmath101 fm , which is slightly outside the nuclear surface ( the corresponding neutron density there is about 1/2 - 1/10 of the central density ) .",
    "the pair potential decreases rather slowly with moving outside the surface region , and it is about to diminish only at very large distances @xmath102 fm . it is much more extended than the neutron density .",
    "furthermore the spatial correlation persists in this low density region as shown in fig.3(b ) .",
    "we note that the spatial correlation is present also in stable open shell nuclei@xcite , and it is enhanced around the nuclear surface .",
    "however the nucleons ( and hence the cooper pairs ) do not penetrate far outside the surface in stable isotopes ( cf bottom panel of fig.3(b ) ) .",
    "the pair correlations in the dilute surrounding is a unique feature of weakly bound nuclei .",
    "if spatially correlated di - neutrons exist in nuclei , especially in the low - density skin / halo region , there may emerge new modes of excitation reflecting the motion of di - neutron(s ) .",
    "this simple idea@xcite has been a focus of theoretical and experimental studies of the soft dipole excitation in two - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "although the reality is not that simple , the core+n+n models@xcite of @xmath65li explain the observed large e1 strength of the soft dipole excitation@xcite in terms of the pairing and the spatial correlation of the valence halo neutrons .",
    "it is interesting to explore possibility of similar excitation modes in heavier mass neutron - rich nuclei , where more than two weakly bound neutrons contribute to the pair correlation .",
    "a useful scheme to describe excitation modes built on the pair correlated ground state is the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) .",
    "let us take the formulation based on the same skyrme - hfb model that is used for the description of the ground state.@xcite having a qrpa excited state @xmath103 , one can calculate the two - particle amplitude @xmath104 which tells us how two particles move in the excited state @xmath105 in reference to the ground state ( of the @xmath106 system ) . for simplicity",
    "let us look at the zero - range part at @xmath107 of the amplitude : @xmath108 which is called the pair transition density .",
    "figure 4 is an example of soft dipole excitation which suggests motion of the spatially correlated di - neutrons@xcite .",
    "the soft dipole excitation is seen here as a bump of the e1 strength which lies just above the neutron separation energies ( @xmath109 mev ) . in neutron - rich ni isotopes beyond the @xmath110 shell closure",
    "both of the one- and the two - neutron separation energies are calculated to be very low @xmath111 mev . in such weakly bound nuclei ,",
    "the low - lying dipole modes appear just above the separation energy since it is possible to excite a bound neutron to unbound orbits in the continuum , letting the neutron escape from the nucleus . if the pair correlation is taken into account , however , the mode is dominated by the pair motion rather than by a simple particle - hole ( or independent two - quasiparticle excitation ) .",
    "consequently the pair transition density @xmath112 has larger amplitude , especially for @xmath113 , as seen in fig.4(b ) .",
    "it is not explicit in this figure whether the neutron pair in the excited state is spatially correlated , but we can infer it from the observation that a large number of orbital angular momenta @xmath86 reaching more than 10@xmath114 have significant and coherent contributions to the pair transition density . as we discussed above ( cf .",
    "fig.2 ) , large @xmath86 implies a spatial correlation at small distances between the two neutrons .    a similar mode of excitation having the character of di - neutron motion",
    "is predicted also in the octupole response in the same istopes @xmath115ni beyond @xmath110.@xcite it is a smooth distribution of neutron strength lying just above the threshold energy ( like the soft dipole mode ) , and it coexists from the octupole surface vibrational mode of the isoscalar character seen in many of stable nuclei .",
    "in contrast to the light two - neutron halo nuclei , the presence of the spatial correlation does not influence strongly the e1 strength of soft dipole excitation in heavy neutron - rich nuclei such as @xmath116ni .",
    "we need other probes which are directly connected to the pair transition density .",
    "since the soft dipole excitation in @xmath65li and in @xmath115ni is located above the two - neutron separation energy , one can expect that momentum distribution / correlation of two neutrons emitted from the soft mode may carry information on the spatial correlation of the neutron pair .",
    "quantitative theoretical description of the two - neutron correlation is achieved only for the core+n+n models@xcite for @xmath65li and @xmath66he , and experimental information is very scarce so far@xcite .",
    "it is possible to describe the two - neutron correlation in the continuum also in the framework of the qrpa since the information on the directions of two neutrons are contained in the pair transition density @xmath104 especially in its asymptotic form at @xmath117 .",
    "it is an interesting future subject to study in heavier neutron - rich nuclei such as @xmath115ni using the hfb+qrpa formalism .",
    "the two - neutron transfer reactions such as ( p , t ) and ( t , p ) are known as a good probe to the pair correlation in the ground state@xcite . more precisely it can be regarded as a probe of the cooper pair wave function , especially its behavior at small relative distances between the paired neutrons .",
    "consider the ( p , t ) reaction populating the ground state of the neighboring @xmath106 nucleus in the single - step dwba and the zero - range approximation .",
    "then the transition matrix elements involves the form factor@xcite @xmath118 which is the convolution of the cooper pair wave function @xmath119 with the two - particle wave function @xmath120 in the triton . noting the small radius of the triton @xmath121 fm , we see immediately the form factor picks up the correlation at small relative distances in the cooper pair wave functions .",
    "it is then not a very bad approximation to utilize the cooper pair wave function at zero relative distance @xmath122 , i.e. @xmath123 as a substitute of the form factor assuming @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath125 is nothing but the pair density @xmath126 implemented automatically in the skyrme - hfb model using the pairing force of the contact type@xcite .",
    "an example@xcite of the calculated pair transition density @xmath125 is shown in fig.5(a ) for sn isotopes covering from stable isotopes to very neutron - rich @xmath127sn .",
    "it is seen that the radial dependence of @xmath125 suddenly changes at the @xmath128 shell closure ( at @xmath129sn ) . in neutron - rich isotopes beyond @xmath128",
    ", the amplitude extends far outside the nuclear surface @xmath130 fm ( @xmath131 fm ) .",
    "this happens because neutron single - particle orbits above the @xmath128 shell gap are bound only weakly , and the weakly bound neutrons have density distributions extended far outside the nuclear surface .",
    "( the one - neutron separation energy is the order of @xmath132 mev for @xmath133 , while it is more than 8 mev in isotopes with @xmath134 . ) consequently both the pair potential @xmath100 and the cooper pair wave function keep non - negligible magnitude even far outside ( see also fig.3 ) . as seen in the figure the amplitude @xmath125 extends up to @xmath135 fm for the isotopes @xmath136 .",
    "the above observation leads to an expectation that the ( p , t ) and ( t , p ) cross sections may be enhanced considerably as the neutron separation energy becomes small@xcite .",
    "an estimate of the isotopic trend , much simpler than the dwba calculation , is shown in fig.5(b ) .",
    "here is plotted the strength which is defined by @xmath137 it is illuminating to compare it with the isotopic trends of the pairing gap @xmath3 squared ( @xmath3 being an average value of the pair potential @xmath100 ) . if the pair potential and the pair transition density are confined in the nuclear volume , a proportionality relation @xmath138 is expected@xcite in analogy with the @xmath139 of the deformed rotor since the pair gap is a deformation parameter@xcite .",
    "we see in fig.5(b ) that the proportionality @xmath138 valid for @xmath140 is violated for @xmath133 and especially @xmath136 , where the strength @xmath141 significantly increases .",
    "the two - neutron transfer reaction on the neutron - rich isotopes ( e.g. the sn isotopes with @xmath133 ) thus provides us a tool to probe the cooper pair wave function in the low - density region far outside the nuclear surface .",
    "it is predicted@xcite also that the isotopes @xmath142sn with @xmath143 exhibit a precursor phenomenon , i.e. , an anomalously large two - neutron transfer strength of ( t , p ) type for the transitions to the excited @xmath144 states ( fig.5(b ) ) .",
    "recently two - neutron transfer experiment on the halo nucleus @xmath65li has become available , and the crucial role of the pair correlation is demonstrated.@xcite we wait for a future experiment using the radioactive beams of neutron - rich sn isotopes with @xmath133 .",
