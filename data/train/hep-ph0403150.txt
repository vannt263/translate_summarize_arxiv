    "recent experiments clarified that the solar neutrino deficit and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly are strong evidences for the neutrino oscillations with three generations .",
    "the solar neutrino deficit is explained by @xmath7 oscillation @xcite and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is explained by @xmath8 oscillation @xcite . in the recent sno @xcite and kamland experiments",
    "@xcite , the solar neutrino problem has been solved by the large mixing angle ( lma ) msw solution @xcite .",
    "furthermore the upper bound of @xmath9 is given by the chooz experiment @xcite .",
    "thus , there are two small parameters @xmath10 the remaining problems are the determination of sign @xmath11 , the measurement of the 1 - 3 mixing angle @xmath9 and the cp phase @xmath2 @xcite . in the limit of vanishing mixing angle @xmath9 or vanishing mass squared difference @xmath12 ,",
    "the cp violating effects in the oscillation probability disappear .",
    "therefore the magnitude of the two small parameters @xmath13 and @xmath6 controls the magnitude of the cp violation . the lma msw solution in the solar neutrino problem has opened the possibility of the observation of cp violation in the lepton sector . for this purpose , many long baseline neutrino experiments are planned @xcite .",
    "the matter effect received from the earth is important in the long baseline neutrino experiments , because fake cp violation is induced due to matter effect . the preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) is well known as the model of the earth density and is usually used in analysis of long baseline experiments .",
    "however , it has recently been pointed out in geophysical analysis of the matter density profile from j - parc to beijing @xcite that the deviation from the prem is rather large . in this paper",
    ", we derive an approximate formula of neutrino oscillation probability without assuming any specific earth density models .    in constant matter , various approximate formulas have been proposed in low energy @xcite , in intermediate energy @xcite and in high energy regions @xcite . in the case",
    "that the matter density is not constant , approximate formulas have been also derived in @xcite using perturbative calculations to analyze the terrestrial matter effect .",
    "however , the question of how to separate the genuine cp violation due to the leptonic cp phase from the fake cp violation induced by matter effect has not been investigated sufficiently in arbitrary matter .",
    "the next step is to analyze the cp violating effects in more detail in the case of non - constant matter density . in order to obtain a hint for this problem",
    ", we will briefly review the approach applied in the solar neutrino problem .",
    "it is difficult to derive the exact solutions for solar neutrino problem in three generations except for some special matter profile . as an approach to derive the neutrino oscillation probability ,",
    "a low energy approximate formula was proposed in @xcite . by averaging @xmath11",
    ", they derived the formula @xmath14 this is a formula to reduce the calculation of the survival probability @xmath15 in three generations to that of @xmath16 in two generations .",
    "therefore this formula is called the reduction formula @xcite .",
    "this reduction formula is useful for the analysis of solar neutrino experiments , but it is not directly applicable to long baseline neutrino experiments planned in the future , because we can not average @xmath11 in long baseline experiments .",
    "therefore we need to derive the reduction formula which is valid without averaging @xmath11 .    in a series of previous papers",
    "we have calculated the oscillation probability @xmath17 . in the papers @xcite",
    "we have shown that the cp phase @xmath2 dependence of @xmath17 in constant matter is given in the form @xmath18 and have derived an exact but simple expression for the coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the next paper @xcite",
    "we have presented a simple and general formula which does not depend on the matter profile . as a result",
    "we have concluded that the equation ( [ cp - dependence ] ) is valid even in arbitrary matter .",
    "however , in the case of non - constant matter density , there exist no closed - form expressions for the coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we propose a simple method to derive the approximate formula of the coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 taking account of the small parameters @xmath13 and @xmath6 . the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are linear in @xmath13 and @xmath21 .",
    "these coefficients represent the genuine three flavor effect .",
    "therefore it has been considered that the first order perturbative calculations of @xmath13 or @xmath9 are needed for the derivation of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "however it is possible to calculate @xmath0 and @xmath1 _ without the usual first order perturbative calculations _ of small parameter @xmath13 or @xmath6 in our method .",

    "since both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are hamiltonians in two generations , the equations ( [ reduction-1])-([reduction-3 ] ) are formulas in order to reduce the calculation of the coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 in three generations to the oscillation amplitudes in two generations .",

    "next we introduce how to derive an approximate formula from this framework .",
    "we also discuss the difference between our method and usual methods .      in this subsection we briefly review that the cp dependence of the oscillation probability @xmath17 is given in the form as @xmath33 in arbitrary matter .",

    "@xcite , this is pointed out for the case of constant matter density .",

    "first , this formula is derived by using only two small parameters @xmath13 and @xmath6 without assuming a specific matter density model .",

    "second , the reduction formula ( [ kuo - pantareone ] ) applied to the solar neutrino problem is valid only in the case that the averaging for @xmath74 is possible . however , our formula is effective even in the case that the oscillation probability can not be averaged .",
    "namely , it is applicable to long baseline experiments .",
    "third , we derive this formula _ without the first order perturbative calculations _ of small parameter @xmath13 or @xmath6 .",
    "this is the reason why our derivation is easier than usual perturbative methods proposed by other authors .",
    "more detailed discussion is given in the next subsection .",
    "in this subsection , we compare our method with usual perturbative methods and describe the advantage of our method clearly . from the result of the previous subsection , the dependence of the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 on @xmath13 and @xmath21 is given by @xmath75 as both @xmath13 and @xmath21 are small parameters , there are two kinds of perturbative methods .",
    "one method is to consider @xmath13 as a small parameter and treat @xmath9 exactly .",
    "another method is to consider @xmath21 as a small parameter and treat @xmath13 exactly .",
    "the former case means that we consider @xmath42 as a perturbation from @xmath31 @xmath76 we need to perform the first order perturbative calculation to obtain @xmath19 and @xmath20 in this perturbative method .",
    "similarly , the later case means that we consider @xmath42 as a perturbation from @xmath32 @xmath77 in order to calculate @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we need to perform the first order perturbative calculation . in both cases ,",
    "we need to perform the first order perturbative calculation , because the cp violating effects disappear in the limit of vanishing @xmath13 or @xmath9 .",
    "let us interpret the above usual perturbative method by using the general formulation ( [ coefficient - a ] ) and ( [ coefficient - b ] ) as follows .",
    "the expressions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are represented by two kinds of amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the dependence ( [ order - s^h ] ) and ( [ order - s^l ] ) of the two amplitudes on @xmath13 and @xmath21 is rewritten as @xmath78 if we use the expansion in terms of @xmath21 to calculate both amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the amplitude @xmath54 can be calculated in the zeroth order perturbation .",
    "however , @xmath55 need to be calculated in the first order perturbation . in the same way , if we use the expansion in terms of @xmath13 , the amplitude @xmath55 can be calculated in the zeroth order perturbation , but @xmath54 need to be calculated in the first order perturbation .",

    "if we expand @xmath54 in terms of @xmath21 instead of @xmath13 , we do not need to perform the first order perturbation .",
    "similarly , if we expand @xmath55 in terms of @xmath13 instead of @xmath21 , we do not need to perform the first order perturbation to calculate @xmath55 .",
    "one of the essential points of our method is that the hamiltonian to calculate @xmath23 is different from that to calculate @xmath24 .",
    "another point is that we only have to calculate @xmath23 and @xmath24 by using the hamiltonian @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the framework of two generations , respectively .",
    "these ideas make the calculations of the probability easy .",
    "in this section , we calculate the concrete expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 both in vacuum and in constant matter by using the new method .",
    "moreover , we compare the value of these coefficients with exact value by numerical calculation .      at first",
    ", we calculate @xmath23 in vacuum , namely in the case of @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath23 is @xmath80 from the hamiltonian ( [ low - hamiltonian ] ) .",

    "@xmath87 is the eigenvalue given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 and @xmath90 correspond to the sign @xmath91 and the opposite sign @xmath92 , respectively .",

    "moreover we obtain the effective mixing angle @xmath105 is calculated as @xmath106 from ( [ eigenvalue - high ] ) and ( [ eignvector - high ] ) we obtain the relation @xmath107 the amplitude @xmath24 is calculated as @xmath108 substituting ( [ constant - s^l ] ) and ( [ constant - s^h ] ) into ( [ approximate - a ] ) , ( [ approximate - b ] ) and ( [ approximate - c ] ) , we obtain @xmath109 the low and high energy msw effects are contained in @xmath110 and in @xmath111 of the approximate formula , respectively .",
    "this is the reason why this approximate formula is applicable to a wide energy region .",
    "the term including @xmath20 , which is proportional to @xmath112 , is related to t violation @xcite .",
    "however it is difficult to observe only this term in future long baseline experiments .",
    "therefore there are many attempts to extract the information on the cp phase from the terms including both the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "next let us compare our approximate formula with the exact one .",
    "we use the parameters @xmath113 ev@xmath114 , @xmath115 ev@xmath114 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , the oscillation length is @xmath119 km @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the fermi constant and @xmath122 is the electron density in matter calculated from the matter density @xmath123 and the electron fraction @xmath124 .",
    "we plot the coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of the energy within the region @xmath125 .",
    "these coefficients calculated from the exact formula are compared with those from the approximate formula in fig . 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     from this figure we find that the approximate formula almost coincide with the exact formula .",
    "the error is estimated to be less than 20 @xmath126 from fig .",
    "the difference between the exact and the approximate formulas is caused by ignoring the higher order terms in the perturbative expansion on @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "in this section , we derive the approximate formulas given by other authors in constant matter from our formula .",
    "there are formulas for the low energy @xcite , the intermediate energy @xcite and the high energy regions @xcite .",
    "at first we derive a low energy formula with large mixing angle @xmath127 , which is similar to those in @xcite . under the low energy condition @xmath128 the following relation @xmath129",
    "is derived by expanding @xmath130 and @xmath105 in terms of @xmath131 .",
    "namely @xmath130 and @xmath105 in matter can be approximated by the quantities in vacuum .",
    "furthermore , if we take the limit @xmath132 @xmath133 is obtained . by using the relations ( [ ratio31 ] ) and ( [ ratio21 ] ) , the coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath1 for ( [ constant",

    "in addition to this condition , the applicable region of ( [ low - a ] ) , ( [ low - b ] ) and ( [ low - c ] ) is restricted by @xmath137 which comes from the approximation in the oscillation parts of ( [ low - a ] ) , ( [ low - b ] ) and ( [ low - c ] ) .",
    "a similar result can be obtained for the perturbation of @xmath6 @xcite .",

    "the applicable region is rather restricted because of the expansion of the oscillation part . on the other hand , it has the advantage that the contribution of the genuine cp violation can be easily distinguished from that of the fake cp violation .",
