    "nonthermal radiation observed from astrophysical systems containing relativistic jets and shocks , e.g. , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , and galactic microquasar systems usually has power - law emission spectra . in most of these systems ,",
    "the emission is thought to be generated by accelerated electrons through the synchrotron and/or inverse compton mechanisms .",
    "radiation from these systems is observed in the radio through the gamma - ray region .",
    "radiation in optical and higher frequencies typically requires particle acceleration in order to counter radiative losses .",
    "it has been proposed that the needed particle acceleration occurs in shocks produced by differences in flow speed .",
    "fermi acceleration is the most widely known mechanism for the acceleration of particles in astrophysical environments characterized by a power - law spectrum .",
    "this mechanism for particle acceleration relies on the shock jump conditions in relativistic shocks ( e.g. , gallant 2002 ; niemiec & oskowski 2004 ) .",
    "most astrophysical shocks are collisionless since dissipation is dominated by wave - particle interactions rather than particle - particle collisions .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) relies on repeated scattering of charged particles by magnetic irregularities ( alfvn waves ) to confine the particles near the shocks .",
    "however , particle acceleration near relativistic shocks can not be characterized as dsa because the propagation of accelerated particles ahead of the shock can not be described by spatial diffusion .",
    "anisotropies in the angular distribution of the accelerated particles are large , and the diffusion approximation for spatial transport does not apply ( achterberg et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "previous microphysical analyses of the energy conversion in relativistic pair outflows interacting with an interstellar medium consisting of cold protons and electrons ( e.g. , brainerd 2000 ; schlickeiser et al .",
    "2002 ) have demonstrated that the beam excites both electrostatic and low - frequency magnetohydrodynamic alfvn - type waves via a two - stream instability in the background plasma .",
    "this work has also provided the time evolution of the distribution functions of beam particles and the generated plasma wave turbulence power spectra .",
    "while in these simulations the jet front showed some evidence of fermi acceleration , the main acceleration of electrons appeared to take place in the downstream region ( e.g. , brainerd 2000 ; schlickeiser et al .",
    "2002 ; ostrowski & bednarz 2002 ) .",
    "further work in this area is required if significant progress is to be made in unraveling the important collisionless processes in relativistic shocks .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations can shed light on the physical mechanism of particle acceleration that occurs in the complicated dynamics within relativistic shocks .",
    "recent pic simulations using injected relativistic electron - ion jets show that acceleration occurs within the downstream jet , rather than by the scattering of particles back and forth across the shock as in fermi acceleration ( frederiksen et al .",

    "the jet electrons are bunched along the jet direction and expanded transversely due to a two - stream - type instability . in this simulation",
    "the thin jet remains axisymmetric and behaves quite differently from the twisted thin electron - ion jet simulated in paper i. since the radius of the thin jet is of the order of the electron skin depth and underresolved , it is not clear if the weibel instability is excited .",
    "nevertheless , the electron bunching seen in this case as opposed to the electron twisting see in the electron - ion case illustrates the potential effect of ion mass on the two - stream instabilities .",
    "the differences between the two thin jet cases suggest excitation of the electrostatic two stream instability for the electron - positron jet and ambient medium as opposed to the buneman electron - ion drift instability for the case of electron - ion jet and ambient medium .",

    "this simulation system is different from simulations performed using counter - streaming equal number density particles spanning the computational domain in the transverse direction .",
    "the important differences between this type of simulation and previous counter - streaming simulations is that the evolution of the weibel instability is examined in a more realistic spatial way including the motion of the jet head , and we can have different number densities in beam and ambient medium .",
    "electron density and current filaments resulting from development of the weibel instability behind the jet front are shown in figure 2 at time @xmath36 .",
    "the electrons are deflected by the transverse magnetic fields ( @xmath37 ) via the lorentz force : @xmath38 , generated by current filaments ( @xmath39 ) , which in turn enhance the transverse magnetic fields ( weibel 1959 ; medvedev and loeb 1999 ) .",

    "the transverse acceleration seen here is over four times that seen in the comparable electron - ion simulation in paper i at comparable simulation time ( see fig .",
    "3 paper i ) and the deceleration is also much greater . the strongest acceleration and deceleration takes place around the maximum amplitude of perturbations due to the weibel instability at @xmath46 revealed qualitatively in figure 2 and more quantitatively in figure 4 .",
    "since the electrons and positrons have the same mass , they are accelerated equally perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field . at the jet front some jet electrons and positrons are accelerated and some are decelerated .",
    "this acceleration and deceleration is indicated by the slanting of the parallel velocity distribution at the jet head ( fig .",

    "simulations with a longer system and a longer simulation time are required ( @xmath143 ) ( frederiksen et al .",
    "2004 ; hededal et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "calculation of the increase in thermal energy of ambient electrons for the four cases shows that : ( a ) @xmath144 , ( b ) @xmath145 , ( c ) @xmath146 , and ( d ) @xmath147 . in the electron - positron ambient plasma , the thermal energy of electrons and positrons",
    "is increased about 6 times more than thermal energy of the electrons in the electron - ion ambient plasma .",
    "the electron - positron shock is much quicker at converting bulk kinetic energy into thermal energy ( particle acceleration ) and magnetic field energy .",
    "we have performed self - consistent , three - dimensional relativistic particle simulations of relativistic electron - positron jets propagating into magnetized and unmagnetized electron - positron ambient plasmas .",
    "the main acceleration of electrons takes place in the downstream region .",
    "processes in the relativistic collisionless shock are dominated by structures produced by the weibel instability .",
    "this instability is excited in the downstream region behind the jet head , where electron density perturbations lead to the formation of current filaments .",
    "the nonuniform electric field and magnetic field structures associated with these current filaments decelerate the jet electrons and positrons , while accelerating the ambient electrons and positrons , and accelerating ( heating ) the jet and ambient electrons and positrons in the transverse direction .",
    "two new findings are confirmed in this study . as shown in the previous sections , density , current , electric and magnetic field amplitudes for electron - positron jet and plasma are significantly larger than the those for a comparable electron - ion jet and plasma at similar simulation time . in the electron - positron plasma ,",
    "both electron and positrons participate in exciting the weibel instability .",
    "transverse acceleration and deceleration of the jet particles , an acceleration of the ambient particles , and transverse acceleration ( heating ) of jet and ambient particles inside the `` shock '' region is significantly larger than in the electron - ion case as described in the previous sections .",
    "however , we evaluate our electron - ion results at the similar simulation time to our electron - positron results . at this simulation time ions have not yet participated in the dynamics significantly . at long time and longer spatial scales , the ion dynamics becomes dominant ( e.g. , hededal et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "secondly , comparison between simulations with different plasma frequency reveals the expected growth rate decrease as the plasma frequency decreases .",
    "this is accompanied by the expected growth length and filament size increase as the electron skin depth , @xmath148 , increases as shown in figs , 6 , 7 , and 8 .",
    "the weibel instability originates from the fact that the electrons are deflected by the perturbed ( small ) transverse magnetic fields accompanying the current filaments and subsequently enhance the current filaments ( weibel 1959 ; medvedev & loeb 1999 ; brainerd 2000 ; gruzinov 2001 ) .",
    "the deflection of particles due to the lorentz force increases as the magnetic field perturbation grows in amplitude .",
    "our results here are consistent with results from previous simulations ( silva et al .  2003 ;",
    "frederiksen et al .  2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the basic nature of the weibel instability ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ; nishikawa et al .",
    "2003 ) is also confirmed in this study of electron - positron jet cases . in particular , the aperiodic nature of the instability ( @xmath149 = 0 ( convective ) ) is observed in the evolution of the generated transverse magnetic field ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "thus , it can be saturated only by nonlinear effects and not by kinetic effects , such as collisionless damping or resonance broadening .",
    "hence the magnetic field can be amplified to very high values locally as shown in figs . 7b and 7d ..    in general",
    ", we find that the absence of an ambient magnetic field leads to slightly larger maximum values for the perturbations produced by the weibel instability . qualitatively there appears to be little change in the current filament and transverse magnetic field structure resulting from the ambient magnetic field that we have considered here .",
    "this result is similar to that found previously for the flat electron - ion jet injected into a magnetized and unmagnetized electron - ion plasma .",
    "thus , our present ambient magnetic field oriented parallel to the flow direction with alfvn wave speed greater than the thermal speed for the the electron - positron plasma or less than the thermal speed for the electron - ion plasma , has only a minor influence on the results .    the perturbed electron density and filamented currents have a complicated three - dimen - sional structure .",
    "the transverse size of these structures is on the order of the electron skin depth and is somewhat larger if there are no ambient magnetic fields .",
    "however , the length of structures along the jet direction is slightly larger than the transverse scale . at the termination of our simulations , for an electron skin depth @xmath151 the thickness of the unstable region along the jet direction ranges from @xmath152 to @xmath153 , is @xmath154 , and is similar for electron - ion jets and plasma .",
    "the perturbation size in the transverse direction become largest around @xmath155 where nonlinear effects lead to the merging of the smaller scale filaments that first appear behind the jet front .",
    "this result is similar to previous counter - streaming simulations ( silva et al . 2003 ; frederiksen et al .",
    "2004 ; medvedev et al .",
    "2004 ) in which smaller filaments first appear and then merge into larger filaments at a later time .",
    "now we see the temporal development appear as a spatial development and this occurs about eight growth lengths , @xmath156 from the position of the jet injection .",
    "recent observations show that from optical observations alone the wiggles in the light curves of grb 011211 are the result of spherically asymmetric density or energy variations , i.e. variations that cover less than the observed @xmath157 region ( jakobsson et al .",
    "the @xmath157 region has a transverse size of @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the radial distance to the gamma - ray emitting region . with @xmath160  cm the variations need",
    "only be somewhat smaller than say @xmath161  cm .",
    "collisionless shocks mediated by the weibel instability have density and current structures with sizes on the order of the electron skin depth . the typical transverse weibel filament size @xmath162 , where here the relevant value of the plasma frequency in the observer s frame for the weibel instability is @xmath163 .",
    "we note that the length of filaments will be subject to length contraction but since the longitudinal plasma frequency is @xmath164 the filament aspect ratio should be preserved .",
    "the resultant size for any reasonable estimate of the plasma frequency is many orders of magnitude smaller than the asymmetric density variations implied by the light curves .",
    "thus , the gamma - ray burst may be composed of emission from many different regions but with variation from region to region on much larger scales than those we have considered here .",
    "since we found little difference between no magnetic field and modest magnetic field ( the alfvn wave speed was on the order of the thermal speed ) , we might expect our present results to apply in the presence of magnetic fields with magnetic energy in equipartition with the thermal energy in the downstream region .",
    "the generation of magnetic fields both with and without an initial magnetic field suggests that emission in grb afterglows and crab - like pulsar winds could be either synchrotron or jitter emission ( medvedev 2000 ) .",
    "the size of filaments appear to be smaller than can produce observable variations in intensity structure .",
    "however , this small size can mean that the deflection angle , @xmath165 , of particles by weibel filaments is smaller than the radiation beaming angle , @xmath166 ( medvedev 2000 ) . here",
    "@xmath167 , @xmath168 , and the ratio @xmath169 will be less than one when the cyclotron frequency is less than the plasma frequency .",
    "thus , when ambient magnetic fields are moderate , i.e. , the cyclotron frequency is less than the plasma frequency and @xmath170 , the emission may correspond to jitter rather than synchrotron radiation .",
    "our simulation studies have provided a framework for the dynamics of a relativistic shock generated within an electron - positron or an electron - ion relativistic jet .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath0 set of simulations is appropriate to internal shocks resulting from faster material overtaking slower material in the reference frame of the slower material , ambient medium in our simulations . here",
    "the `` shock '' lorentz factor , @xmath171 , can be related most simply to the lorentz factors of high , @xmath172 , and low , @xmath173 , speed material with @xmath174\\ ] ] where @xmath175 .",
    "provided @xmath176 , @xmath177 implies @xmath178 .",
    "for example , our present simulation set is relevant to internal agn jet shocks produced by @xmath179 material overtaking @xmath180 material and to internal grb shocks produced by @xmath181 material overtaking @xmath182 material .",
    "the fundamental characteristics of relativistic shocks are essential for a proper understanding of the prompt gamma - ray and afterglow emission in gamma - ray bursts , and also to an understanding of the particle reacceleration processes and emission from the shocked regions in relativistic agn jets .",
    "since the shock dynamics is complex and subtle , more comprehensive studies are required to better understand the acceleration of electrons , the generation of magnetic fields and the associated emission .",
    "this further study will provide the insight into basic relativistic collisionless shock characteristics needed to provide a firm physical basis for modeling the emission from shocks in relativistic flows .",
