    "a second order phase transition has been observed in the heavy fermion metal uru@xmath0si@xmath0 at @xmath3=17.5  k via a sharp discontinuous jump in the specific heat with about 24% entropy loss.@xcite considering an associated sharp anomaly in the @xmath4axis magnetic susceptibility , it was initially assumed to be an antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase.@xcite however , in subsequent works,@xcite including a very recent one,@xcite the presence of any static magnetic moment has been eliminated .",
    "this apparent ` magnetic dichotomy ' has remained a smoking gun feature of the phase , known as the ` so - called ' hidden order ( ho ) phase of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "additional key fingerprints of the ho state include a relatively weak intensity peak at the commensurate wavevector @xmath5=(001),@xcite and a dispersive collective excitation at an incommensurate vector @xmath6=(1@xmath70.4,0,0),@xcite as probed by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurement .",
    "furthermore , the ins spectral weight loss at the incommensurate wavevector , as opposed to the commensurate one , can fully account for the entropy loss at the ho transition .",
    "direct spectroscopies including angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite and point contact spectroscopy@xcite have found the presence of a fermi surface ( fs ) gapping at the ho state , which is consistent with the bulk measurement of about 40% loss of quasiparticle weight at this phase.@xcite finally , a shubunikov de - hass ( sdh ) measurement finds that the quantum oscillation frequency does not change by any significant amount in going from ho phase at ambient pressure to the large moment af ( lmaf ) phase at high pressure.@xcite considering also the high - magnetic field phase diagram of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 where the ho phase is intertwined with the lmaf and possibly with other unknown phases,@xcite this sdh data can be interpreted along the same line . therefore , a feasible solution to the ho problem lies in a theory which can explain the ` magnetic dichotomy ' , while accounting for the large fs gapping and entropy change , among others .",
    "according to the fermi - liquid theory , the ho phase transition is associated with a symmetry breaking static order parameter .",
    "numerous evidence of anomalies probed by ins@xcite and spectroscopies@xcite at either @xmath5 and/ or at @xmath6 suggest that ho breaks translational symmetry .",
    "recent evidence from ultrasonic measurement@xcite ( and also from arpes@xcite ) points to the presence of a lattice anomaly ( @xmath8-type lattice symmetry breaking ) at the ho transition , suggesting the involvement of orbital degrees of freedom , in addition to spin . as mentioned before ,",
    "no evidence of time - reversal symmetry breaking is reported to date.@xcite interestingly , a recent magneto - torque measurement has reported the presence of an in - plane rotational symmetry breaking in a single crystal sample , which , however , has been placed on hold until reproduced.@xcite    this interesting problem has triggered the development of many novel proposals .",
    "while these proposals are mainly targeted to solve the ho state in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , they are also interesting in a general ground . among them , many multipolar orders , including quadrupoles,@xcite octupoles,@xcite hexadecapoles@xcite to dotriacontapoles or rank-5 orders@xcite can be highlighted .",
    "however , an interesting group analysis study have shown that such higher - rank order parameters are not allowed in uru@xmath0si@xmath0.@xcite among dipole orders conventional and unconventional spin,@xcite orbital,@xcite and other unconventional orders@xcite have been proposed .",
    "variety of theoretical models aiming to explain the ` nematic ' behavior of the ho state ( if indeed exists ) are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in a third paradigm ,",
    "the typical concept of hybridization between light and heavy bands has been extended to be modulated with a specific nesting wavevector without spin,@xcite with 1/2 spins in both bands,@xcite and with integer and 1/2 spins in heavy and light bands , respectively@xcite .",
    "however , multiple spectroscopic data including stm,@xcite point - contact tunneling,@xcite and arpes@xcite as well as resistivity , specific heat and magnetic susceptibility@xcite have demonstrated that the hybridization phenomena is insensitive to the ho temperature , and it starts at a much higher temperature ( about 60 - 100  k ) .",
    "this is supported by good consistency of the arpes data in the paramagnetic phase with first - principles band structure calculation , with some discrepancies lying mainly along the @xmath9 direction.@xcite more interestingly , only the hybridization theory@xcite and the present sodw theory assuming incommensurate nesting can only explain the ins dispersion and the spectral weight loss at this wavevector , while no other theory has succeeded in explaining this crucial experimental signature of the ho phase .    taken together , a consistent and widespread research activity from both theoretical and experimental perspectives have been channeled in the ho research for three decades , and the recent boost to it has been triggered by the high - quality sample preparation and spectroscopic data .",
    "these high - quality data have been successful in narrowing down the possible origin of the ho state , however no consensus about the nature of ho phase has yet been reached . in present author s opinion ,",
    "the solution is hidden in the ` magnetic dichotomy ' associated with the ho state .",
    "these clues have led to the proposal of the sodw which explains this apparent paradox .",
    "the paper includes a coherent combination of new calculations , a review on the prior works , and also hints of future works on sodw .",
    "the first - principles bandstructure calculation and the low - energy modelling presented in secs .  3 , 4 , and a major part of the discussions in sec .",
    "5 are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . a substantial overlap between secs . 6 , 8 and ref .  @xcite can also be expected .",
    "some parts of the application of sodw in other materials which deal with the arpes results for two - dimensional electron gas with rashba - type soc is taken from ref .",
    "the rest of the calculations and figs .  3 , 4 , 5 , 6(e)-(h ) , 7 , 10 are produced here .",
    "recently , it has been shown that soc can drive new states of matter , including quantum spin - hall effect,@xcite and topological insulator,@xcite without electron - electron interaction via symmetry invariance .",
    "another relevant physics of our interest is the theory of weyl semimetal , originally refereed to ` accidental degeneracy in bands'@xcite , in which multiple relativistic dirac points are scattered in the momentum space ( and thus termed ` semimetal ' ) owing to a broken crystal symmetry , but they remain topologically protected via other subjective symmetry invariance . considering the ` magnetic dichotomy ' of the ho phase which apparently breaks time - reversal symmetry ( magnetic anomaly ) and preserves time - reversal symmetry ( no magnetic moment ) , we introduce the concept of sodw .",
    "it breaks translational symmetry by fs nesting , but respects time - reversal invariance owing to the soc.@xcite while the model is originally applied to uru@xmath0si@xmath0,@xcite it has subsequently been extended to two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems in which interface induced rashba - type soc is strong , and finite interaction strength can give rise to the sodw and fs gapping,@xcite consistent with corresponding arpes data.@xcite    the essential ingredient for the sodw is the presence of ( at least ) two spin - orbit split bands in the low - energy spectrum , and the fs nesting between them is to be significantly large",
    ". if the soc strength is larger than the coulomb interaction , an interband spin density wave ( sdw ) which breaks time - reversal symmetry is disfavored .",
    "however , above a critical value of the interorbital coulomb strength , a sodw can emerge .",
    "the schematic view of the sodw is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) , in momentum and real - space , respectively . in the @xmath10-space ,",
    "thin solid blue and red lines are two bands , split by soc @xmath11 , while the corresponding dashed lines are the folded bands shifted by a nesting vector @xmath12 .",
    "the sodw order gaps out the ` accidental degenerate ' points on the fs , and the weight of each orbital is mixed between them .",
    "it is evident that sodw can be thought of as two concomitant sdws with opposite spin state at each spatial point , owing to large soc .",
    "for rashba - type soc , the spin - chirality of each band is different to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and thus the low - energy hamiltonian changes slightly ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : other ] ) , however , the general concept is the same .",
    "the consistency of the sodw properties with many experimental signatures of the ho phase in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is appealing , particularly as it reconciles the apparently contradictory magnetic properties of this phase . among them , we highlight several robust features as : ( 1 ) the present order breaks translational symmetry,@xcite and spin - rotational symmetry , but thanks to soc , the order parameter respects time - reversal symmetry and charge conservation at each lattice point .",
    "( 2 ) as a result , no magnetic moment is induced , in agreement with measurements.@xcite ( 3 ) time - reversal symmetry invariance fosters magnetic field to be a perturbation to the order parameter , and the corresponding critical field primarily depends on the gap value and the @xmath13-factor .",
    "experiments validate the vanishing of the ho around @xmath14  t.@xcite .",
    "( 4 ) as a consequence , as field increases the ho gap decreases ( given other parameters such as temperature is constant ) , and thus the resistivity decreases .",
    "in other words , a large magnetoresistance effect is expected within the sodw framework .",
    "( 5 ) finally , we offer a detectable prediction of a second spin-1 collective mode localized inside the gap at @xmath15 in the sodw state which can be probed via electron spin resonance ( esr ) or nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) at zero magnetic field or polarized neutron scattering measurements .",
    "finally , we envisage to take this model further and apply to laalo@xmath2/srtio@xmath2 ( lao / sto)@xcite and iridium - oxide ( iridate)@xcite where soc and electronic interaction are large and tunable . in these materials , we present evidence of quasiparticle gapping@xcite , and strong reduction of preexisting magnetic moment below critical temperature , magnetic field or carrier density , as seen in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 along the pressure axis .",
    "in order to determine the symmetry properties of the low - lying states , we begin with investigating the _ ab - initio _ ` parent ' band dispersion and the fs of uru@xmath0si@xmath0@xcite in fig .  [ fig2 ] . the electronic structure in the vicinity of the fermi level ( @xmath16 ) ( @xmath70.2ev ) is dominated by the 5@xmath17 states of u atom in the entire brillouin zone.@xcite due to the lack of the ` so - called ' itinerant states of @xmath18- or @xmath19-characters within the @xmath7500  mev vicinity of @xmath16 , the typical hybridization process is weak in this system , and is pushed to a higher temperature @xmath2060 - 80  k @xcite .",
    "furthermore , pertaining to larger atomic size of 5@xmath17-electrons in u - atoms , than in the largely localized smaller 4@xmath17-atoms , the inter - atomic electron hopping is larger here and mobile 5@xmath17 electrons stem within the single - electron picture . in other words , the electronic structure of this actinide compound can be described adequately by first - principles calculation , without invoking kondo - like physics .",
    "in fact , the good consistency between the dft calculation@xcite and arpes data@xcite has excluded the presence of @xmath18-electrons within the @xmath7500  mev vicinity of @xmath16 to cause any significant hybridization .    owing to the soc and the tetragonal symmetry , the 5@xmath17 states split into the octet @xmath21=@xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) states and the sextet @xmath21=@xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) states .",
    "uru@xmath0si@xmath0 follows a typical band progression in which the @xmath23 bands are pushed upward to the empty states while the @xmath25 states drop to the vicinity of @xmath16 .",
    "the dft band structure , calculated by wien2k software,@xcite is shown by blue solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) along several representative high - symmetry momentum directions in the body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) lattice of the crystal .",
    "the corresponding fs topology is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , overlayed by a shifted fs with the ` hot - spot ' wavevector @xmath26 ( red lines ) in this unit cell notation .",
    "paramount fs nesting is evident here between the two spin - orbit split bands , and hence identified it to be responsible for the sodw state .",
    "the fs nesting property is confirmed by static susceptibility calculation , plotted in the basal plane momentum space , in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , exhibiting a dominant peak at this @xmath12 vector .",
    "the band structure shifted by @xmath12 is then plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) in red color which reveals that the low - energy bands are linear in momentum , and the contact points between main- and folded - bands at @xmath16 are in the particle - hole channel along the ( 110 ) direction .",
    "therefore , the nesting condition in this system resembles the so - called ` accidental degenerate points ' or weyl - type dirac cones@xcite .",
    "since the nesting is between different spin - orbit split bands , a typical sdw is prohibited by time - reversal symmetry and the strong soc in this case . on the other hand , a spin - orbit entangled order parameter in the two - particle channel can collectively propagate with alternating sign in the total angular momentum at the wavelength determined by the modulation vector .",
    "this is the guiding instability that drives spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking , while the time - reversal symmetry remains intact .",
    "this is because , both @xmath27 groups for spin and orbital separately are odd under time - reversal , but their product @xmath28 is even .",
    "as the parent state is not a non - trivial topological phase , a gap is opened to lift the fs instability .",
    "motivated by the above - mentioned experimental results and band structure symmetry properties , we write down the effective theory for the sodw using two soc split bands .",
    "we restrict our discussion to the low - lying @xmath25 bands and neglect the unfilled @xmath23 bands . due to the @xmath29-@xmath29-type soc and time - reversal symmetry , the @xmath25 atomic states consist of three doublets , characterized by up and down ` pseudospins ' : @xmath30=@xmath7@xmath24 ,  @xmath7@xmath31 ,  @xmath7@xmath32 , where @xmath30 is the @xmath33 component of @xmath21 .",
    "although we consider all relevant bands that cross @xmath16 directly from the dft results for the numerical calculations , however , to explicate the physical mechanism of sodw , and the role of soc in it , we start from a two - orbital basis with atomistic soc , @xmath11 .",
    "if no other symmetry is broken , the other band ( mostly of @xmath21=@xmath24 character ) remains ungapped and thus not considered in the discussion .",
    "we , however , note that a nesting between @xmath21=@xmath24 and @xmath21=@xmath31 states as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , can also lead to sodw at a different interaction strength .",
    "the purpose here is to derive a general hamiltonian of such kind , in which no particular assumption of the orbital symmetry and the relevant details of the soc are imposed .",
    "our starting noninteracting hamiltonian is thus @xmath34 , \\label{h0}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the electron creation operator in the @xmath36 orbital with spin @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is its corresponding dispersion spectrum in a translational invariant crystal of bloch momentum @xmath10 . with a translational symmetry breaking at the reduced reciprocal wavevector or the `` hot - spot '' vector @xmath12 , the new spin - orbit basis in the nambu - space yields @xmath39 .",
    "the spin - polarized nambu operator is an important consideration which distinguishes the present sodw order parameter from an inter - orbital sdw , and promotes a _ zero _ magnetic moment as will be evaluated rigorously below . in this basis , we express our interacting hamiltonian in a matrix form@xcite as @xmath40 the sodw field parameter @xmath41 is taken to be complex for generality and will be defined below .",
    "this sodw hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) is very similar to the one proposed for the rashba - type soc system,(see sec .",

    "first , we define the bogolyubov spinor for the soc term as @xmath42 after this basis transformation , the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "the canonical density operators @xmath50 take equivalent forms as before , and the corresponding quasiparticle states are replaced by @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . a schematic view of the sodw split bands and the shared orbital character , determined by coherence factors @xmath53 between them is given in fig .",

    "<S> we provide a brief review and detailed analysis of the spin - orbit density wave ( sodw ) , proposed as a possible explanation to the ` hidden order ' phase of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 . due to the interplay between inter - orbital coulomb interaction and spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in this compound , </S>",
    "<S> the sodw is shown to arise from fermi surface nesting instability between two spin - orbit split bands . </S>",
    "<S> an effective low - energy hamiltonian including single - particle soc and two - particle sodw is derived , while numerical results are calculated by using density - functional theory ( dft ) based band structure input . </S>",
    "<S> computed gapped quasiparticle spectrum , entropy loss and spin - excitation spectrum are in detailed agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , despite the fact that sodw governs dynamical spin - excitations , the static magnetic moment is calculated to be _ </S>",
    "<S> zero _ , owing to the time - reversal invariance imposed by soc . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , sodw can be destroyed by finite magnetic field even at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our estimation of the location of the quantum critical point is close to the experimental value of @xmath1  35  t. finally , we extend the idea of sodw to other soc systems including iridium oxides ( iridates ) and two - dimensional electronic systems such as biag@xmath0 surface and laalo@xmath2/srtio@xmath2 interface . we show hints of quasiparticle gapping , reduction of preexisting magnetic moment , large magneto - resistance etc . in these systems which can be explained consistently within the sodw theory .    </S>",
