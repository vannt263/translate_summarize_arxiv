    "we imagine that the strong flare in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 originates in a compact reconnection site elevated to a height @xmath0 above the surface of the accretion disk .",
    "the radiation from this primary source partly shines toward the disk and creates a hot spot . the distance of the spot s center to the disk center",
    "is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the flare is supposed to be in keplerian co - rotation with the disk and we assume that the primary illumination sets on and fades out instantaneously .",
    "the irradiation of the disk then evolves across the hot spot , starting from the spot center and progressing toward the border .",
    "therefore we expect the lightcurve of the reprocessed radiation to be curved even if the time evolution of the primary is box - shaped .",
    "we want to model the exact shape of the lightcurve expected from such a flare setup at different orbital phases of the disk .",
    "we first conduct detailed local radiative transfer computations .",
    "the varying intensity of the irradiation across the hot spot is taken into account as well as the angular dependence of the reprocessed emission .",
    "the vertical structure of the disk is assumed to remain in the same hydrostatic equilibrium as before the onset of the flare .",
    "the profile is computed with an extended version of the code described in ( * ? ? ? * raska  ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "the local spectra across the spot are then computed by the codes titan and noar ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dumont  2000 , 2003 ) ) .",
    "we assume a black hole mass @xmath2 , a disk accretion rate @xmath3 ( in units of the eddington accretion rate ) , and @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) .    based on the local spectra , the relativistic ray - tracing code ky ( ( * ? ?",
    "* doviak  2004 ) ) computes the time evolution of the spectrum seen by a distant observer .",
    "we set the disk inclination to @xmath6 and assume a kerr parameter @xmath7 having known characteristics of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 in mind .",
    "in ky we define the time - dependent disk emission according to the subsequent illumination and fade - out of the spot from its center toward the border .",
    "the duration of this time sequence is normalized by @xmath0 , which we constrain from the observed soft - to - hard time delay of @xmath8  s ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ponti  2004 ) ) .",
    "we assume that this delay is entirely due to the light traveling time between the source and the disk leading to @xmath9 .",
    "the flare lasts for 2000  sec , which at @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath10 of the keplerian time scale .",
    "more details about this type of flare model are given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* goosmann  ( 2006 ) ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lcs ] we show the model lightcurves obtained for flares at 8 different orbital positions .",
    "they show significant differences in shape and in normalization when comparing different orbital phases .",
    "all curves have a broadened maximum which does not match the observed , peaked shape ( see fig .  4 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ponti  2004 ) ) .",
    "thus , even if the flare is reflection - dominated , neither the geometrically evolving irradiation across the spot nor relativistic and doppler modifications can account for the observed shape of the lightcurve .",
    "an intrinsic time evolution of the primary source is therefore required .    ]",
    "* ponti  ( 2004 ) ) conducted a timing analysis for the observed flare and computed cross - correlation functions and time delays between six different energy bands @xmath11 ( see their fig .",
    "we attempt to reproduce the observed time delays using the following , simple mathematical parameterization for the primary radiation @xmath12 and the reprocessed component @xmath13 :          these terms account for the intrinsic change of the primary that is suggested by the modeling presented in section  [ sec : lcs ] .",
    "the overall factor @xmath20 normalizes @xmath13 against the primary and @xmath21 denotes an intrinsic delay between the two components",
    ". the time evolution of the reprocessing can be broadened by choosing @xmath22 .",
    "this represents a spread of the light travel - time between the source and the reprocessing site . for further details on this model see ( *",
    "* goosmann  ( 2007 ) ) .            where the lightcurve @xmath27 belongs to the energy bin @xmath28 .",
    "we adopt here the very same method as was used in the analysis of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ponti  ( 2004 ) ) .",
    "the values for @xmath29  sec and @xmath30  sec are adjusted to the flare lightcurve plotted in fig .  4 of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ponti  ( 2004 ) ) .",
    "the spectral slope of the reprocessed component has a major impact on the obtained energy - dependent time delays .",
    "we choose a rather hard slope of @xmath13 and set @xmath31 .",
    "such a spectral shape corresponds to the reprocessing in a medium of magnetically confined , cold clouds as analyzed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kuncic , celotti , & rees(1997 ) ) . their fig .",
    "2 shows reprocessed model spectra that are much harder than the primary due to multiple soft x - ray absorption by the individual clouds . for the primary slope we set @xmath32 having in mind that for the higher flux state during the flare the spectrum should steepen ( ( *",
    "* shih , iwasawa , & fabian 2002 ) ) .",
    "the model can reproduce the observed time lags for the observed flare of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcg - delay - fit ] we show two examples of satisfactory data representation",
    ". the results account for the slight flattening of the delay curve toward higher energies .",
    "it turns out that different choices of parameters can lead to similar delay curves , as there are three free parameters involved ( @xmath20 , @xmath33 , and @xmath21 ) and the error bars of the data are large .",
    "to distinguish between different parameter sets some fine tuning of the delay curves shape would be necessary .",
    "this is not meaningful with the current data .",
    "the observed time - delay can not be reproduced when the spectral slope of @xmath13 is softer , i.e. adjusted to an ionized reflection scenario as proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ballantyne , vaughan , & fabian(2003 ) ) .",
    "if the primary source is located within @xmath39 of the black hole , the relative variability of the primary and the reflection component can be reproduced ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* miniutti & fabian  2004 ) ) .",
    "such a setup also explains the high equivalent width of the iron k@xmath40 line , which requires a relatively large amount of reflection . while these ionized reflection and light - bending models",
    "are certainly important to explain the behavior of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 on longer time - scales , the data obtained during the 2000  sec flare period does not allow to conclude on the time evolution of the iron k@xmath40 line .",
    "from the results of our delay modeling , we therefore suggest the possibility that the strong individual flare does not originate in the inner accretion flow , where most of the x - ray energy is dissipated .",
    "we rather imagine that the flare occurred farther away from the black hole , in a region where the disk is fragmented and replaced by magnetically confined , cold clumps ."
