    "recently , the titanium perovskites @xmath1tio@xmath2 ( where @xmath1 is the rare - earth element or y ) have attracted considerable attention .",
    "these , formally isostructural and isoelectron materials , crystallize in the orthorhombic space group @xmath4 and have only one electron in the @xmath0-shell of ti - atoms .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic properties of @xmath1tio@xmath2 appear to be extremely sensitive to the magnitude and details of the lattice distortion .",
    "more distorted compounds with @xmath1@xmath3 yb - gd ( including ytio@xmath2 ) appear to be ferromagnetic ( fm ) .",
    "the curie temperature ( @xmath5 ) typically varies from about 30 k ( @xmath1@xmath3 y and gd ) till 60 k ( @xmath1@xmath3 dy , ho , and tm ) @xcite .",
    "less distorted compounds ( @xmath1@xmath3 sm - la ) form the so - called g - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) structure , where all nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spins are coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "the nel temperature ( @xmath6 ) varies monotonously from 146 k ( latio@xmath2 ) till 48 k ( smtio@xmath2 ) .",
    "the complete phase diagram of @xmath1tio@xmath2 can be found in @xcite .    the origin of the fm - afm transition and , more generally , the microscopic physical picture underlying the behavior of these mott - hubbard insulators with partially filled @xmath0-shell is a matter of considerable debates .",
    "different types of theories ranging from the degenerate orbital liquid @xcite to the distortion - controlled crystal - field ( cf ) splitting of the atomic @xmath0-levels @xcite have been proposed .",
    "the main obstacle with the setting of the proper physical model is related to the fact that there are too many model parameters , which can drastically change the picture if they are chosen in a uncontrollable way .",
    "for example , the orbital liquid state is rapidly deteriorated by the lattice distortion away from the simple cubic structure .",
    "the conventional cf theories @xcite crucially depend on the choice of the dielectric constant , which controls the magnitude of the @xmath0-level splitting .",
    "thus , in unbiased theories for @xmath1tio@xmath2 , it is very important to reduce to the minimum all arbitrariness related to the choice of the model parameters by using for these purposes first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "this direction is sometimes called `` the realistic modeling of strongly correlated systems '' @xcite .    our previous works @xcite were devoted to construction of the parameter - free lattice fermion model ( more specifically  the multiorbital hubbard model ) for the low - energy @xmath0-bands of distorted perovskite oxides : @xmath7 the model itself is specified in the basis of six wannier orbitals ( the so - called spin - orbitals ) , which are denoted by greek symbols , each of which is a combination of two spin ( @xmath8@xmath3 @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) and three orbital ( @xmath11@xmath3 @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 ) variables .",

    "other details can be found in the original work @xcite as well as in the review article @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss how the lattice fermion model ( [ eqn : hmanybody ] ) for the @xmath25 compounds can be further mapped onto the the spin-@xmath26 model of the general form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the three - dimensional tensor , describing various interactions between spins at the sites @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "it can be further decomposed into isotropic heisenberg ( @xmath29 , antisymmetric dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( @xmath30 ) , and symmetric anisotropic ( @xmath31 ) interactions , , the single - ion anisotropy term is absent . ] so that the model itself can be rewritten @xmath32 ) + \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle } ( \\hat{\\bsigma}_i , \\hat{\\tau}_{ij } \\hat{\\bsigma}_j ) , \\label{eqn : spinmodel2}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the vector of pauli matrices in the spin subspace and the prefactor @xmath34 for @xmath35@xmath3@xmath26 is included in the definition of the model parameters @xmath28 , @xmath36 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , @xmath36 is the scalar , @xmath37 is the vector , and @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 and @xmath40 stand to denote the @xmath41- , @xmath42- , or @xmath43-components in the orthorhombic coordinate frame ) is the three - dimensional tensor satisfying the condition @xmath44 .",

    "the goal of this work is twofold . on the one hand",
    "we will discuss different levels of approximations for the superexchange ( se ) interactions underlying derivation of the spin hamiltonian ( [ eqn : spinmodel1 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we investigate the accuracy of realistic modeling for different types of materials .",
    "particularly , how far one can go with the description of not only qualitative but also quantitative aspects of interatomic magnetic interactions in @xmath1tio@xmath2 . for these purposes",
    "we will consider four characteristic compounds : fm ytio@xmath2 and gdtio@xmath2 , and g - type afm smtio@xmath2 and latio@xmath2 .",
    "we will also present details of the parameters of the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hmanybody ] ) and interatomic magnetic interactions ( [ eqn : spinmodel1]-[eqn : spinmodel2 ] ) .",

    "sec : structure ] ) and description of parameters of the hubbard hamiltonian as derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hubbardparameters ] ) , we will turn directly to the analysis of the se interactions .",
    "we will start with the one - electron approximation ( referring to the form of the ground - state wavefunction in the atomic limit ) and consider different types of the one - electron theories , such as the conventional cf theory at @xmath49@xmath3@xmath50 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cf ] ) , cf theory with the relativistic so interactions , which explains the appearance of anisotropic and antisymmetric dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cfso ] ) .",
    "we will also estimate the effect of thermal fluctuations of the orbital degrees of freedom on the interatomic interactions between the spins ( sec .",
    "[ sec : multislater ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : singleslater ] we will consider a many - electron extension of the se theory , where the ground - state wavefunction is determined from the diagonalization of two - electron hamiltonians constructed separately for each bond of the system .",
    "particularly , we will argue that the behavior of latio@xmath2 is drastically differrent from other compounds . if in ytio@xmath2 , gdtio@xmath2 , and smtio@xmath2 the type of the magnetic ground state is mainly determined by the cf splitting , which is clearly larger than the energy gain caused by the virtual hoppings underlying the se processes and the relativistic so interaction , in latio@xmath2 all three factors are at least comparable making the situation less straightforward .",
    "this revives the idea of our earlier work @xcite , and now we will explicitly show how the combination of many - electron effects in the bonds and the relativistic so interaction may explain the afm character of interatomic correlations in latio@xmath2 .",

    "nevertheless , we would like to emphasize that apart from these approximations , we did not use any adjustable parameters . in this sense ,",

    "the off - diagonal elements ( @xmath39@xmath19@xmath40 ) describe the transverse correlations , which are related to the noncollinear spin arrangement in the bond @xmath18-@xmath20 .",
    "generally , the longitudinal correlations are strongly anisotropic . for example , within one bond the correlations can easily become either fm or afm , depending on the direction in the orthorhombic lattice .",
    "the transverse correlations , which are solely caused by the relativistic so interaction , can be also strong and comparable with the longitudinal ones .    for the fm systems",
    ", this picture may substantially differ from the one without the so interaction .",
    "however , it should be noted that the details of the ground state in the fm case are determined by the small splitting of the low - lying spin - triplet levels by the so interaction . for the most of the systems",
    "this splitting is small and typically varies from few hundredths of mev to one mev .",
    "for example , for the fm bond 1 - 2 in ytio@xmath2 ( lt ) , the second and third levels are split from the lowest one by 0.56 mev and 0.59 mev , respectively .",
    "therefore , when the temperature exceeds @xmath295 mev@xmath296 k , the proper picture for the magnetic interactions in this compound would correspond to the ( thermal ) average @xmath281 over the low - lying `` spin - triplet '' states .",
    "for example , for the 1 - 2 bond in ytio@xmath2 ( lt ) this procedure yields the following tensor @xmath297 similar results can be obtained for other systems forming the fm bonds .",
    "after the averaging , the longitudinal spin correlations become isotropic , while all transversal correlations are considerably smaller .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the form of the interatomic magnetic interactions tensor @xmath28 obtained on the level of one - electron approximation ( table  [ tab : atensor ] ) .",
    "another effect , which can mix the two - electron states within the lowest manifold of certain bond is related to the virtual hopping in neighboring bonds , which involve one of the atomic sites of the original bond .",
    "note that the many - electron effects will mix the lowest cf orbital at certain atomic site with other states .",
    "the symmetry of these states as well as the magnitude of the mixing will be generally different for different bonds .",
    "since each atom participate in several bonds , this effect will lead to the addition mixing of the low - lying ( spin - triplet ) states obtained from the diagonalization of the two - electron hamiltonian separately for each bond of the system .",
    "nevertheless , the quantitative estimate of this effect requires a more rigorous solution of the many - electron problem , which is beyond the scopes of the present work .    in the case of latio@xmath2 ,",
    "all longitudinal correlations in the bond 1 - 3 are antiferromagnetic , while the transversal correlations are small .",
    "the correlations in the bond 1 - 2 are strongly anisotropic : if @xmath298- and @xmath299-components favor the fm coupling , the @xmath300-correlations are antiferromagnetic .",
    "the splitting between the lowest and the next two two - electron levels in the bond 1 - 2 is about 4 mev , which is considerably larger than the splitting obtained in other ( more distorted ) compounds .",
    "therefore , the effect is expected to be more robust against the thermal fluctuations mixing the spin - triplet states .",
    "strong transversal correlations are also expected .",
    "thus , the @xmath300-correlations appears to be antiferromagnetic simultaneously in the bonds 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 , being consistent with the g - type afm structure .",
    "on the basis of this analysis , we expect that if the g - type afm order took place in latio@xmath2 , it would be more likely developed by the @xmath41- ( @xmath226- ) projections of the magnetic moments in the orthorhombic coordinate frame .",

    "( @xmath1@xmath3 y , gd , sm , and la ) , where all the parameters were derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations , we considered different levels of approximations for the construction of the spin - only superexchange model .",
    "namely , after considering the conventional crystal - field theory , where all interatomic magnetic interactions are solely determined by occupied @xmath0-orbitals , that are split off by the crystal distortion , we consecutively incorporate the effects of the relativistic spin - orbit interaction , thermal fluctuations of the orbital degrees of freedom , and many - electron effects related to the virtual electron hoppings in the bonds .    even in the conventional cf theory ,",
    "the interatomic magnetic interactions appear to be extremely sensitive to the details of the orbital structure , and small change of the orbital structure , caused by either crystal distortions or thermal fluctuations , can have a profound effect on the magnetic properties .",
    "particularly , the use of the room- and low - temperature structure for ytio@xmath2 provides rather different sets of parameters of the spin hamiltonian .",
    "the additional distortion in the low - temperature structure tends to weaken the ferromagnetic interactions : it substantially reduces the fm coupling @xmath123 in the orthorhombic @xmath154-plane and makes the coupling along the @xmath228-axis weakly afm",
    ". similar tendency was reported for latio@xmath2 , where the use of the low - temperature structure @xcite could help to stabilize the g - type afm state @xcite .",
    "apparently , some of the problems encountered in the present work , such as the incorrect magnetic ground state in smtio@xmath2 and the overestimation of the curie temperature in gdtio@xmath2 , may be resolved by using the low - temperature structural data for these compounds , which are not available today .",
    "moreover , the thermal fluctuations of the of the orbital degrees of freedom near the cf configuration can substantially reduce the value of the magnetic transition temperature ( up to 40% ) .",
    "the relativistic spin - orbit interaction , which is responsible for the appearance of anisotropic and antisymmetric dzyaloshinsky - morita interactions , leads to the noncollinear magnetic alignment .",
