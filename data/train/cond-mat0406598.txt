    "a possibility to investigate non  equilibrium critical phenomena is given by absorbing phase transitions .",
    "these are transitions from an active fluctuating phase with a finite particle density to an absorbing state where any dynamics is suppressed .",
    "a central question in the theory of critical phenomena is the determination of the universality class of a given system . in the field of absorbing phase transitions rather robust universality classes",
    "have been found , e.g. the class of directed percolation ( dp ) and the parity conserving universality class ( pc ) . for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in order to determine the respective universality class the calculation of critical exponents plays a central role .",
    "one possibility to determine critical exponents is to consider the scaling of stationary quantities with respect to the distance from the critical point @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the control parameter and @xmath2 the critical point .",
    "one defines the exponents @xmath3 by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the stationary particle density , @xmath6 is the ultimate survival probability , i.e. the probability that a randomly chosen site belongs to an infinite cluster , and @xmath7 are the spatial and temporal correlation lengths .    another possibility is given by dynamical scaling where the time dependence of the quantities when started from an initial seed is used to define the exponents .",
    "at the critical point , @xmath8 , one defines : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the probability that a system survives at time @xmath11 , i.e. that there are still active particles left , @xmath12 is the particle density _ inside _ an active cluster and @xmath13 is the particle number averaged over _ all _ , i.e. , active and inactive , systems .",
    "this set of exponents is not independent of the previous set , one can deduce generally for second order transitions @xcite @xmath14 furthermore the following argument gives another relation between the exponents : the particle density inside an active cluster is given by the particle number in a specific _ active _ system , @xmath15 divided by the spreading region @xmath16 @xmath17 here @xmath18 indicates that the average is taken only over active systems . for large times",
    "one expects that @xmath19 as the spreading region scales like @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dimension and @xmath22 is the dynamical exponent .",
    "thus we get the hyperscaling relation @xmath23    this rather intuitive derivation should hold for first @xcite and second order phase transitions . a more detailed derivation of the hyperscaling relation for second order transitions can be found in refs .",
    "it has also been shown that a hyperscaling relation can be defined for the case of coupled systems , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "as there is hardly any model used for investigating absorbing phase transitions that can be solved analytically , all critical exponents have to be determined numerically .",
    "an exception to this is the bosonic pair contact process with diffusion ( bosonic pcpd ) for which a field theoretic approach due to howard and tuber @xcite is available . in this context",
    "the term bosonic refers to the property that there is no exclusion rule for the particles , each lattice site may be occupied by any number of particles .",
    "this leads to a theoretical description in terms of bosonic operators instead of fermionic operators in the case of exclusion models .",
    "a drawback of this model is that it exhibits a first order transition and is thus not suitable for deciding the universality class of the pcpd with particle number restriction , which is still an open problem @xcite . for a comprehensive review of the current state of the art",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .    however , an exceptional property of the bosonic pcpd is the fact that some of the critical exponents are known exactly @xcite .",
    "this information provides a possibility to test the commonly considered hyperscaling relation eq .",
    "( [ pcpd : eq : hyper ] ) for the critical exponents . as still",
    "some quantities are not accessible analytically monte carlo simulations are used to get the complete set of exponents .",
    "it turns out that in some cases simulations of the bosonic pcpd are misleading in general .",
    "we consider the following process as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite : on a infinite @xmath21dimensional cubic lattice particles ( @xmath24 ) are diffusing with rate @xmath25 , in each spatial direction .",
    "additionally they branch and annihilate : @xmath26 particles @xmath24 are created with rate @xmath27 out of any set of @xmath28 particles , and @xmath29 particles are annihilated with rate @xmath30 out of any set of @xmath28 particles : @xmath31 the number of particles on each lattice site is not restricted  the creation and annihilation processes take place on one lattice site .",
    "thus the bosonic representation of the process is used .",
    "one special case is the pcpd , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for @xmath34 the particles die out according to a power law , while for @xmath35 the particle density diverges .",
    "in analogy to the exclusion model we call the rate which divides the two different behaviors the `` critical '' rate , @xmath36 for given @xmath27 @xcite . for this rate",
    "the total particle number is constant for all times .    for the details of the formalism we refer to refs .",
    "the time evolution of the particle annihilation operators @xmath37 is derived for the case @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath41-th unit space vector .",
    "the particle density is given by @xmath42 and the correlation function by @xmath43 .",
    "in the theory of absorbing phase transitions beneath spatial homogeneous initial conditions often the following scenario is used : initially the lattice is empty except for the origin where just as many particle are located as needed for the dynamics to start .",
    "it is then investigated how this activity spreads into the system . in this section",
    "the question is addressed what can be learned from this initial condition in the bosonic pcpd .    after presenting analytically solvable cases we test the hyperscaling relation of the critical exponents . to this end",
    "additional information is needed which can be obtained from monte carlo simulations .      as initial condition of the system",
    "we choose two particles at the origin @xmath44    for the average particle number @xmath45 we recover the same result as for the density in the case of spatially homogeneous initial conditions : for @xmath35 the particle number diverges ( `` active phase '' ) while all particles die out for @xmath34 ( `` inactive phase '' ) . in the active phase a spreading cone forms ,",
    "i.e. a growing region with non ",
    "zero density .",
    "if @xmath46 is chosen the time evolution of the density is simply a lattice diffusion equation and the solution is given by @xmath47 for large arguments @xmath48 and @xmath11 this function asymptotically approaches a gaussian distribution , thus the dynamical exponent is @xmath49 and the average particle number is constant , @xmath50 .    by defining @xmath51 and rescaling time by @xmath52",
    "the time evolution of the second moment can be rewritten as @xmath53 where @xmath54 we rescaled time by the factor @xmath55 instead of @xmath56 in order to keep the notation consistent with the previous publication , ref .",
    "@xcite .    equation ( [ pcpd_ii : f_dgl ] ) can be solved using a two  component fourier ",
    "transformation @xmath57    the differential equation for the fourier ",
    "transform @xmath58 can be cast into the form @xmath59 with the dispersion relation @xmath60 and @xmath61 integration yields @xmath62 the initial condition equation ( [ pcpd_ii : initial ] ) reads in fourier space @xmath63 .",
    "thus we get for the correlation function @xmath64 where @xmath65    an analytical solution of this integral equation could not be found but for the sum of the autocorrelations , @xmath66 the situation simplifies because of the following identity @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a modified bessel function .",
    "we thus get @xmath69 this equation is exactly the one for the lagrangian multiplier in the mean spherical model and we can use the already known results here @xcite . using a laplace transformation ,",
    "@xmath70 we get @xmath71 an analysis of the behavior for small @xmath1 gives the late time behavior of @xmath72 .",
    "depending on the dimension we find a phase transition with respect to @xmath73 .",
    "the critical point is given by the same @xmath74 as found before for spatially homogeneous initial conditions as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . above the critical point ,",
    "@xmath75 , the sum of the autocorrelations diverges as before . at the critical point @xmath76",
    "the sum of the autocorrelations follows a power law @xmath77 for @xmath78 and approaches a constant for @xmath79 . below the critical point @xmath80",
    "the sum of the autocorrelations follows a power law @xmath81 .",
    "not that for @xmath82 the critical point is zero , @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the behavior below the critical point can be understood using the interpretation from spatial homogeneous initial conditions that in this regime the diffusion is dominant .",
    "a diffusive system without reactions shows the same late time behavior of the autocorrelator : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the probability to find @xmath86 particles at site @xmath48 at time @xmath11 which for independent particles starting from the origin can be expressed as products of the propagator @xmath87 .    above the critical point",
    "the reaction processes are dominant . as on average the particle number in each system is @xmath28 in most of the systems the particles have to vanish in order that in few systems a divergence of the second moment is possible .",
    "this has crucial influence on the possibility to simulate the process as discussed in the next section .",
    "= 3.5 in      = 3.5 in    = 3.5 in    the hyperscaling relation eq .",
    "( [ pcpd : eq : hyper ] ) shall now be verified in the bosonic pcpd where we know after all some of the exponents exactly .",
    "the arguments given for the hyperscaling relation should hold irrespectively of the type of density / number which is measured . while in the description of the process with exclusion interaction there are only two possibilities  the number of particles and pairs , i.e. two particles on neighboring sites  in the bosonic description there are three possibilities .",
    "the number of active sites , these are sites with at least one particle , have to be distinguished from the number of particles .",
    "so one may consider the number of active sites , of particles or of particle pairs .",
    "the number of particles is constant at the critical point , thus we have @xmath88 .",
    "the number of pairs is given by @xmath89 whose behavior is calculated in subsection [ pcpd : subsec : analytical ] : @xmath90 for @xmath75 the number of pairs diverges exponentially and thus no exponent can be defined .",
    "= 3.5 in    in @xmath91 it is expected that @xmath92 : after some initial time there is a fraction of systems consisting only of two particles at different sites .",
    "they are diffusing freely on the lattice and hence their distance vector describes as well a random walk in @xmath21 dimensions . as a random walk is transient for @xmath91 the probability that the two particles ever meet again is zero and consequently those active systems survive for ever and one concludes @xmath92 .",

    "the reaction rates are fixed to @xmath99 and @xmath100 such that the average number of particles remains constant in time . for @xmath97 and @xmath98 the diffusion constant @xmath25 is chosen such that @xmath80 ( @xmath101 for @xmath97 and @xmath102 for d=5 ) , @xmath76 ( @xmath103 for @xmath97 and @xmath104 for @xmath98 ) and @xmath75 ( @xmath105 for @xmath97 and @xmath106 for @xmath98 ) . in the ensemble @xmath107 systems are simulated in parallel .",

    "this is clearly the most fluctuating one .",
    "the simulation indeed fails in reproducing the exponential divergence of the number of pairs for @xmath75 as discussed above . while for @xmath82 the number of pairs is increasing according to a power law , for the higher dimensions it approaches a constant .",
    "interpreting the results for @xmath75 has thus to be done carefully .",
    "the survival probability @xmath10 is shown in fig .",
    "[ pcpd : fig : delta ] .",

    "as most of the exponents take simple values , we conjecture in these cases that @xmath112 and @xmath113 and that the measured deviations result from the numerical problems .",
    "an obvious disagreement between measured values and the hyperscaling relation is found for @xmath114 , where the directly measured value is approximately @xmath115 while the hyperscaling relation predicts it to be approximately zero .",
    "the question arises whether the hyperscaling relation is violated or which of the values is wrong . as the hyperscaling relation turns out to hold in the other cases we believe it to hold in this case as well  the inacuracy in the mc results stems from the fact for @xmath82 the numerical problem is always present because @xmath83 .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this can be imagined as follows : in the surviving systems the active regions spreads diffusively and inside the active region the reaction kinetics generates a constant density .",
    "consequently the particle number increases in these systems proportional to @xmath118 , but as more and more systems die out according to @xmath119 the particle number averaged over all systems remains constant . in @xmath97 and @xmath98 the situation is different , the particle density inside the active region decays and the number of active systems remains constant .",
    "the values for @xmath96 for @xmath120 could not be determined with high accuracy due to the high fluctuations .",
    "it would be surprising if the hyperscaling relation did not hold for this quantity but the accuracy of our data allows neither for proving nor for disproving the relation in this case .",
    "the evolution of the system out of an initial seed ( activity spreading ) is investigated in the bosonic pair contact process with diffusion .",
    "it is shown that the second moment exhibits a phase transition with the same critical point as for spatially homogeneous initial conditions . above the critical point",
    "the sum of autocorrelations diverges and below the critical point it decreases according to a power law .",
    "this power law behavior can be related to purely diffusive dynamics .",
    "this shows that below the critical point it can be neglected that the particles react because most of the time the particles are diffusing freely .",
    "the time during which two particles occupy the same lattice site is too short to react because below the critical point diffusion dominates above reactions .",
    "we tested a hyperscaling relation for the dynamical critical exponents . to this end",
    "exponents have to be determined which are not accessible analytically and are thus calculated numerically in a monte  carlo simulation .",
    "it is shown that for the case of a diverging second moment it is impossible to produce accurate data as the necessary size of the ensemble diverges exponentially in the desired simulation time . at or below the critical point of the divergence of the second moment",
    "the hyperscaling relation can be verified .",
