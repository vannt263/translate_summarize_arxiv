    "although the transformation of luminous cluster disc galaxy populations from mainly spirals to predominantly s0s between intermediate redshifts ( @xmath3 ) and the present is well established ( e.g. dressler 1980 ; dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) , there is as yet no agreed mechanism for this transformation .",
    "one of the earliest explanations proposed was galaxy  galaxy interactions and mergers ( e.g. lavery & henry 1988 ; lavery , pierce & mcclure 1992 ) .",
    "this explanation is attractive both on account of the observed abundance of interacting / merging systems in intermediate redshift clusters ( e.g. dressler et al .",
    "1994a , 1994b ) and because the hubble sequence is readily explainable as a sequence of decreasing merger damage ( schweizer 2000 ) .",
    "nevertheless this explanation was resisted because it was considered that slow galaxy  galaxy interactions and mergers are likely to be rare in virialised clusters ( e.g. ostriker 1980 ; makino & hut 1997 ; ghigna et al .",
    "although many other explanations have been attempted , including ram - pressure stripping of the cold interstellar gas of spirals by the hot ionised intracluster medium ( e.g. quilis , moore & bower 2000 ) , galaxy ` harassment ' , the impulsive heating of a galaxy disc by high - speed encounters ( e.g. moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ) , and ` strangulation ' , the stripping of an ( hypothesised ) hot halo gas from spirals ( e.g. larson et al .",
    "1980 ; bekki , couch & shioya 2002 ) , these explanations are not without difficulties ( for a recent discussion , see mihos 2004 ) .",
    "alternatively , attempts have been made to remove the problem entirely from clusters by proposing preprocessing of disc galaxies to earlier type systems in groups in the field ( e.g. balogh et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "however , as remarked by mihos ( 2004 ) , neglect of slow encounters has been premature .",
    "numerical simulations which track galaxy halos in a rich cluster in an @xmath4 cosmology show that between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , although no mergers occur in the central virialised region of the cluster , in the outskirts the merger rate is 59% ( see ghigna et al .",
    "gnedin ( 2003 ) has similarly studied the interaction and merger rates in clusters under different cosmologies . over the lifetime of a cluster",
    ", the distribution of encounter velocities shows a large tail , but a significant fraction of encounters , largely those in the cluster periphery or those occurring at higher redshift before the cluster has fully collapsed , have relatively low velocity .",
    "for example , for an @xmath7 @xmath8 cosmology , some 42% of encounters have a velocity @xmath9 550 km @xmath10 .    as mihos ( 2004 )",
    "has noted , galaxy clusters form not by accreting individual galaxies randomly from the field environment , but rather through the infall of less massive groups falling in along the filaments that make up the ` cosmic web ' .",
    "such infalling groups provide sites with much lower velocity dispersions than that of the cluster , thus permitting strong , slow encounters more normally associated with the field . for low - redshift clusters",
    ", such infall continues at the present ( e.g. moss & dickens 1977 ; tully & shaya 1984 ; sodre et al .",
    "1989 ; colless & dunn 1996 ; biviano et al . 1997",
    "; rines et al .",
    "2003 ) .    besides the theoretical considerations outlined above ,",
    "there is also accumulating observational evidence of the potential importance of galaxy mergers for morphological transformation of cluster disc galaxies , both at low and intermediate - redshift ( e.g. dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; moss , whittle & pesce 1998 ; moss & whittle 2000 , 2005 ; koopmann & kenney 2004 ; sato & martin 2006 ) .    in the present paper the infall population of nearby clusters",
    "is studied using data from an extensive morphological and star formation survey of 8 low - redshift clusters ( moss & whittle 2000 , 2005 ) .",
    "these data are used to construct an ensemble cluster from which general properties of all the clusters can be deduced .",
    "it is shown that a very high fraction ( @xmath2 5070% ) of the infall population are either interacting or possible mergers .",
    "this interaction / merger rate is too high to be accounted for simply on the basis of infalling groups typical of the field , but implies that the accretion process of the cluster enhances the galaxy  galaxy interaction / merger rate .",
    "it is suggested that galaxy shocking ( struck 2005 ) can provide a mechanism to enhance the interaction / merger rate , and that galaxy  galaxy interactions and mergers can provide an explanation for the transformation of most luminous cluster spirals to s0s over the past @xmath2 10 gyr .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the survey data are summarised and construction of an ensemble cluster is discussed . in section 3 ,",
    "various sub - populations of the ensemble cluster are identified , including that of the infall population .",
    "member galaxies of the infall population are considered in detail and an estimate of the interaction / merger rate for this population is given .",
    "discussion is given in section 4 .",
    "it is shown that there is an enhancement of galaxy mergers in the infall population in comparison to the field ; an explanation ( gravitational shocking ) is proposed for this enhancement ; and finally it is shown that it is entirely plausible that the majority of the current s0 cluster population have resulted from galaxy mergers in the past @xmath2 10 gyr .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "using the 61/94-cm burrell schmidt telescope on kitt peak , an objective prism survey was undertaken of combined h@xmath11 + [ nii ] emission in cgcg galaxies ( zwicky et al .",

    "emission was detected in 5% of early - type ( e  s0/a ) and 41% of late - type ( sa + later ) galaxies respectively .",
    "the survey distinguished between _ compact _ and _ diffuse _ emission .",
    "the former has been identified as predominantly due to circumnuclear starburst emission , while the latter is characteristic of more normal disc star formation .",
    "the compact hii emission is associated with a bar in the galaxy ( significance level @xmath16 ) ; with a tidally - disturbed morphology ( significance level @xmath17 ) ; and with the presence of a nearby galaxy companion ( significance level @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is found that compact emission , particularly that associated with a tidally - disturbed galaxy morphology , is enhanced in clusters as compared to the field ( cf .",
    "papers iv and v ) .      for the present study ,",
    "data for the 8 clusters have been combined into a single ensemble cluster .",
    "this procedure necessarily erases structural details for the individual clusters .",
    "however , as will be shown , important properties of all the clusters can be found from the combined data which would otherwise not be revealed by data from a single cluster alone .",
    "the sample galaxies were combined into an ensemble cluster as follows : velocities were normalised by the cluster velocity dispersion , @xmath18 , and scaled to the cluster mean , @xmath19 ; radial distances from the cluster centres ( abell 1958 ) were normalised by the virial radius , @xmath20 .",
    "as will be shown in what follows , the cluster late  type galaxy population ( types sa + later ) has an infalling component with higher velocity dispersion than the early - type cluster galaxies , as well as a component whose velocity distribution is asymmetric with respect to the cluster mean .",
    "in contrast , the early - type cluster population has a gaussian distribution expected for virially relaxed galaxies in the cluster",
    ". a recent study of 59 clusters in the eso nearby abell cluster survey has also confirmed that deviations from a gaussian velocity distribution for early - type galaxies in the ensemble of these clusters are very small ( cf .",

    "moreover the early - type galaxies are generally considered to be the oldest cluster population and therefore most likely to be in dynamical equilibrium with the cluster potential . for these reasons , cluster mean ( heliocentric ) velocities and velocities dispersions have been determined from the early - type galaxies alone . for each cluster , @xmath19,@xmath18 were determined using biweight estimators of central location and scale ( cf .",

    "it is thus concluded that for @xmath2 50%70% or greater of the cluster disturbed galaxy population , their moderate or severe disturbance is likely to be due to galaxy  galaxy interactions associated with slow encounters .",
    "as noted in section [ cip ] , the infall population for the ensemble cluster is identified as ( predominantly ) comprising those cluster galaxies which have moderate or severe tidal disturbance of their stellar populations .",
    "this identification was made on the basis that these galaxies , which are mainly of type sa and later ( 71% of the sample ) , have a higher velocity dispersion ( @xmath53 ) than all remaining cluster galaxies , with a value in good agreement with that expected for an infall population .",
    "remaining cluster galaxies divided into samples of undisturbed galaxies of types sa + later , with and without emission , have velocity dispersions consistent with that for the cluster early - type galaxies ( @xmath54 ) .",

    "moreover there is a 50% increase in the fraction of disturbed sa + later galaxies which have hii emission from @xmath61 for @xmath62 to @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",

    "the two - body relaxation time , @xmath66 , may be roughly estimated as ,    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the number of cluster galaxies and @xmath69 is the cluster crossing time ( cf .",
    "conselice , gallagher & wyse 2001 ) . for the individual clusters in the survey , @xmath70 especially within the high density core region ( @xmath71 ) of the cluster .",
    "since the infall population is not virialised , this suggests it is on first infall or , at the least , is a relatively recent arrival in the cluster . furthermore the enhanced starbursts associated with this population tend to confirm this , since the disturbed galaxies evidently still retain substantial gas which may be expected to be stripped by tidal , ram - pressure and harassment effects by more prolonged exposure to the cluster environment",
    "many authors have attributed the transformation of cluster spirals to s0s to the effects of galaxy harassment , i.e. frequent high - speed galaxy encounters within the cluster . notwithstanding the strong evidence for galaxy interactions and mergers ( see section [ ggm ] above )",
    ", can this mechanism explain the the tidal disruption and associated circumnuclear starburst emission of the infalling galaxy population ?",
    "originally , galaxy harassment was proposed as a mechanism to explain the origin of dwarf elliptical galaxies in clusters as remnants of harassed low - luminosity ( e.g. @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) bulgeless disc galaxies ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ; moore , lake & katz 1998 ) . the effect of multiple close ( @xmath74 kpc ) fast ( @xmath75 km @xmath76 ) encounters with giant cluster galaxies ( @xmath77 ) on the fragile disc of such a galaxy was shown to drastically alter its morphology to resemble that of a dwarf elliptical .",
    "while galaxy harassment is able to describe the formation of dwarf galaxies as well as the fueling of low luminosity agns and the destruction of low - surface brightness galaxies in clusters , it is evident that this scenario is hardly applicable to the present sample of the cluster infall population . for a value of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 km @xmath10 @xmath80 ) adopted by moore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , their most luminous model disc galaxy has an absolute magnitude , @xmath81 = -18.8 , which is fainter than most disturbed galaxies in the ensemble cluster ( see figure [ amd ] ) .",
    "furthermore most of these disturbed galaxies are not bulgeless disc galaxies of types sc  sd as required by the model ( see figure [ ttd ] ) .    in further work , moore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) discuss the effect of galaxy harassment on luminous ( @xmath82 ) disc galaxies .",
    "their simulations show that luminous disc galaxies with a significant bulge component are stable against the effects of galaxy harassment .",
    "this makes it difficult to induce the non - axisymmetric structures in the discs of these galaxies which are required to provide the gravitational torques to drive gaseous inflow to fuel a central starburst . as mihos ( 2004 )",
    "has noted , it is hard to explain strong starburst activity in luminous spirals by galaxy harassment alone ; rather fast encounters tend to trigger a modest disc - wide response of star formation .",
    "however , as has been seen above ( see figure [ vdd ] ) , most ( 88% ) of the detected hii emission in the disturbed galaxies of the infall population is classified as compact , which has been identified in previous work as most likely due to circumnuclear starburst activity ( see papers iv ,",
    "these disturbed galaxies with compact emission are found more frequently in the cluster than in the field ( see paper v ) .",
    "some 40% of disturbed galaxies show compact hii emission in contrast to only 17% of undisturbed galaxies of types sa + later ( see figure [ vdud ] ) .",
    "these results support a scenario of slow gravitational encounters for the disturbed galaxies rather than that of the fast encounters associated with galaxy harassment .",
    "( for further discussion , see thomas et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "one of the motivations for the development of the theory of galaxy harassment was the claim that , for faint disturbed disc galaxies in intermediate redshift ( @xmath83 ) clusters , there was often no sign of an interacting companion , and that therefore an alternative explanation to such interactions was needed in order to explain the observed disturbance ( cf .",
    "moore et al .",
    "however , whatever may be the case for faint disc galaxies , there has never been any doubt that for _ giant _ cluster galaxies , interactions and on - going mergers in these intermediate redshift clusters are abundant ( e.g. lavery & henry 1988 ; lavery , pierce & mcclure 1992 ; dressler et al .",
    "1994a , 1994b ) .    just as galaxy  galaxy interactions and mergers are common among the giant disc galaxy population in intermediate redshift clusters , so it has been shown above ( section [ ggm ] ) that such interactions and mergers are frequent among the non - virialised infall population of low - redshift clusters and can provide a natural explanation for galaxy disturbance for a high proportion ( @xmath2 5070% ) of the members of this population , without need of any recourse to explanations based on fast encounters , even supposing such explanations could account for the degree of disturbance observed . for the remaining members of this population without an obvious cause of disturbance , neither galaxy harassment nor undetected minor mergers can be ruled out . nevertheless , it can be concluded that slow , rather than fast encounters are the predominant cause of the gravitational disruption of giant disc galaxies in low - redshift clusters .",
    "the results obtained above imply an _ enhancement _ of galaxy  galaxy interactions and mergers in the cluster infall population as compared to the field .",
    "for the field population of sa + later galaxies ( @xmath84 ; @xmath85 ) , some 13% ( @xmath86 ) are disturbed , and may be assumed to be in interacting or merging systems .",
    "in contrast , as has been seen , some @xmath2 5070% of the infall population are either interacting or merging with other galaxies .",
    "this is an enhancement by a factor of @xmath2 45 compared to the field population and is statistically very significant ( @xmath46 test , @xmath87 ) .    what is the cause of this enhancement of galaxy  galaxy interactions and mergers in the infall population ?",
    "it is generally accepted that because of the high cluster velocity dispersion , the interaction / merger rate in ( virialised ) clusters is expected to be low ( e.g. ostriker 1980 ; ghigna et al .",
    "what factors , associated with the infall population , could cause the interaction / merger rate to increase ?",
    "one expected difference between the infall population and the relaxed virialised population of the cluster is the predominance of galaxy groups in the infall population .",
    "these groups are likely to be subsequently destroyed by the tidal field of the cluster .",
    "distortions of the orbits of galaxies in infalling groups by the tidal field of the cluster may increase galaxy  galaxy interactions ( cf .",
    "mihos 2004 ) .",
    "another suggestion , due to sato & martin ( 2006 ) , is that group ",
    "group encounters in the infalling population could enhance galaxy  galaxy mergers .",
    "however it may be questioned whether either of these mechanisms alone would be capable of enhancing the interaction / merger rate by the large factor required .    a promising mechanism",
    "to greatly enhance the interaction / merger rate in the infall population is gravitational shocking as proposed by struck ( 2005 )",
    ". struck notes that cold dark matter simulations and observations are in good agreement regarding a common density profile across a range of structures from galaxy halos to the dark halos of large clusters .",
    "moreover observations suggest that the central density decreases slowly with mass in dark matter halos . accordingly for roughly comparable group and halo core densities , the passage of a group through the cluster core would would substantially increase the instantaneous group halo mass . since the typical core crossing time and group free - fall time are comparable , there is time for group galaxies to be pulled into a much denser and compact configuration . in the case that group and cluster core halo densities are roughly comparable , galaxies could be pulled in to roughly half their distance from the ( group ) core , increasing the galaxy density by nearly an order of magnitude and their collisions by a factor of 100 ( density squared ) . in these encounters , dynamical friction will dissipate relative orbital energy , leading to galaxy  galaxy mergers .",
    "this mechanism would readily explain the enhanced galaxy interaction / merger rate found for the infall population of the ensemble cluster .",
    "the gravitational shocking discussed by struck is for groups passing through the cluster core ; clearly , infalling groups encountering any existing cluster sub - structure may also be expected to experience some degree of gravitational shocking .",
    "thus infalling groups may be subject to a series of gravitational shocking events on their infall to the cluster centre , each contributing to the total interaction / merger rate .",
    "in section [ cip ] it was noted that disturbed hii elgs have a higher velocity dispersion ( @xmath88 ) than for the entire sample of disturbed galaxies ( @xmath89 ) . a similar effect is evident in comparing disturbed hii elgs of types sa + later with all disturbed galaxies of these types ( @xmath90 for the two samples respectively ) .",
    "gravitational shocking may help to explain this effect . since not only the frequency , but also the strength of encounters is dependent on galaxy density , the strongest encounters leading to circumnuclear starbursts are most likely to occur where gravitational shocking is most effective , i.e. near the centres of clusters . since the infalling groups which are the sites of such mergers will be near maximum infall velocity , the resulting hii elgs will generally be expected to have a higher velocity dispersion than the overall population of disturbed galaxies .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that major mergers of equal - mass galaxies can result in the formation of an elliptical galaxy with a de vaucouleurs profile ( e.g. negroponte & white 1983 ; barnes 1988 , 1992 ; hernquist 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "in contrast , mergers of unequal mass spirals are expected to result in an s0 galaxy since the remnant retains significant rotation and disc destruction is not complete ( e.g. bekki 1998 ; bendo & barnes 2000 ; cretton et al . 2001",
    "; bekki et al .",
    "alternatively , an s0 can be formed between the merger of a spiral and its satellite : the satellite can help to ` sweep clean ' the disc of cold gas by means of a gravitationally induced bar driving gas to the nucleus , and the galactic disc is not destroyed , but thickened to one characteristic of an s0 ( e.g. toth & ostriker 1992 ; quinn , hernquist & fullager 1993 ; mihos et al .",
    "1995 ; walker , mihos & hernquist 1996 ; mihos 2004 ) .",
    "thus the interactions and subsequent galaxy mergers identified in the sa + later infall population of the ensemble cluster are potentially the precursors of some fraction of the early - type cluster population , most especially of the s0 population .",
    "what fraction of the present s0 population in low - redshift clusters can be accounted for in this way ?",
    "any such estimate is necessarily very uncertain , but it can be attempted as follows . in figure [ ammerg ] is shown the distribution of combined absolute magnitudes for the components of interacting and merging systems in the ensemble cluster ( viz .",
    "the interacting and merging systems identified as ` confirmed ' , ` probable ' and ` possible ' in section [ ggm ] above ) .",
    "also shown in the figure is the absolute magnitude distribution of the s0 population of the cluster .",
    "the completeness limit for the s0 population is approximately , @xmath91 .",
    "following a merger , the resulting early - type remnant is expected to fade by @xmath2 12 magnitudes ( cf . larson & tinsley 1978 ) .",
    "accordingly , the six interacting / merging systems with @xmath92 are expected to be potential precursors of early - type galaxies brighter than the completeness limit , @xmath91 .",
    "the cluster tidal field can act to lengthen the merger time of interacting galaxies , and may even prevent mergers in the case of very loosely bound interacting pairs ( cf .",
    "makino & hut 1997 ; mihos 2004 ) .",
    "on the other hand , this tidal field is likely to quickly strip loosely bound tidal debris associated with interacting galaxies , which may lead to an underestimation of the interaction rate ( see mihos 2004 ) . for simplicity",
    ", these considerations will be neglected . thus if it is assumed that the merger time @xmath93 years , then , for a uniform infall rate into the cluster , @xmath2 60 mergers are expected over the past 10 gyr .",
    "however the infall rate is expected to be higher at earlier times ( e.g. ellingson et al . 2001 ) . accordingly if it is assumed that the mean integrated infall rate is twice the current observed rate , then @xmath2 120 early - type galaxies resulting from mergers are expected over the past 10 gyr .",
    "now the total number of s0 galaxies with @xmath94 in the ensemble cluster is 92 .",
    "thus if mergers are mainly unequal mass mergers and result predominantly in s0 galaxies , most of the s0 population can be readily accounted for as products of interactions and mergers in the cluster infall population .",
    "analysis of an ensemble cluster comprising a complete magnitude - limited sample of giant galaxies ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) in 8 low - redshift clusters has shown that disturbed galaxies in these clusters form a infall population .",
    "it has further been shown that the disturbance of the stellar populations of these galaxies can readily be explained by slow galaxy ",
    "galaxy encounters in at least 5070% of cases . the resulting enhancement of slow encounters in the cluster infall population can be attributed to gravitational shocking ( struck 2005 ) of infalling galaxy groups .",
    "a simple estimate of the galaxy merger rate demonstrates that the cluster giant s0 population can be accounted for as the outcome of minor mergers over the past @xmath2 10 gyr .",
    "notwithstanding this result , obviously not all cluster s0 galaxies need be products of merging galaxies in the infall population ; some early - type cluster galaxies are expected to result from galaxy interactions in groups or the field ( e.g. zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) and this may help explain the correlation between star formation and radial distance to several virial radii from the cluster centre ( e.g. lewis et al . 2002 ; gomez et al . 2003 ; although for an alternative view , see poggianti 2004 ) .",
    "however , contrary to balogh et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , it is not necessary to assume that the majority of cluster s0s have formed by such preprocessing in the field .",
    "indeed the fact that most galaxies in the infall population are spirals ( see section [ dgin ] above ) , rules out such an explanation .",
    "rather , the bulk of transformation of spirals to s0s takes place during , and as an inherent part of the process of virialisation of the infall population .",
    "moreover , at least for the cluster galaxies , other processes may play a significant role in the formation of cluster giant s0 galaxies . for the virgo cluster ,",
    "the majority of spiral galaxies have their h@xmath11 disks truncated most likely due to intracluster medium - interstellar medium ( icm - ism ) stripping as a cause of the reduced star formation ( koopmann & kenney 2004 ) . a similar effect has been found in other low - redshift clusters ( thomas et al .",
    "such ram - pressure stripping of gas is likely to contribute to the transformation of cluster spirals to s0s .",
    "nevertheless , as the present work has shown , it is plausible to suppose that for most cluster giant s0 galaxies their formation has involved slow galaxy  galaxy interactions and ensuing minor mergers .",
    "i would like to thank d. carter and p.a .",
    "james for useful discussions and an anonymous referee for helpful comments .",
