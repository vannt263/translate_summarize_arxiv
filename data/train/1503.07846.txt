    "movement of _ escherichia coli _ consists of periods of running punctuated by tumbling events where the bacterium randomly changes direction . this can result in successful chemotaxis when the probability of initiating a tumble per short time interval ( the tumbling rate ) is a function of the concentration of attractant experienced by the bacterium . in the absence of attractant , an _ e. coli _ bacterium has a constant , basal tumbling rate .",
    "when the attractant concentration experienced by the bacterium is increasing , tumbling events become less frequent , so the bacterium has longer runs in the direction of increasing attractant .",
    "conversely , when the bacterium detects a decreasing attractant concentration , it tumbles more often , shortening its runs down attractant concentration gradients . in _",
    ", this mechanism involves an excitation pathway , inhibiting tumbling , and an adaptation pathway that methylates the receptors , decreasing their sensitivity and thereby attenuating the excitation pathway in the continued presence of attractant .",
    "this `` adaptive '' response allows the bacterium to locate and stay in regions of high attractant concentration .",
    "when attractant concentration plateaus , the tumbling rate returns to the basal rate , a phenomenon called `` perfect adaptation '' .",
    "a consequence of perfect adaptation is that the response is independent of the absolute concentration of attractant and depends only on differences in concentration experienced by the bacterium .",
    "while _ e. coli _ has been instrumental for our understanding of chemotaxis , other bacteria show a considerable variety of chemotactic mechanisms and behaviors  @xcite .",
    "for example , responses have been identified which show very little adaptation , such as in certain cultures of _ rhodobacter sphaeroides _  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , aerotaxis in _",
    "e. coli _ is thought to involve the aer receptor which lacks methylation sites  @xcite , suggesting a lack of adaptation .",
    "strangely , some bacteria seem to tumble more in the presence of attractant .",
    "this appears to be the case in many mutant strains , such as aerotaxis  @xcite and redox taxis  @xcite in mutated _ e. coli _",
    ", aerotaxis in mutated _ salmonella typhimurium _  @xcite , and phototaxis in mutated halobacteria  @xcite . in",
    "_ s. typhimurium _ chemotaxis , this alternative response can be caused by one of a number of single point mutations  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this behavior was also found in wild - type , aerobically - grown _ r. sphaeroides",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "this response seems paradoxical , as the bacterium might be expected to run in the direction of decreasing attractant concentration and tumble more when it detects an increase in attractant concentration , leading to the accumulation of bacteria away from the attractant .",
    "in addressing these puzzling results , goldstein and soyer demonstrated the chemotactic efficacy of a non - adaptive `` inverted '' response  @xcite . with this strategy",
    ", bacteria respond to the absolute attractant concentration , tumbling more and therefore maintaining their position in regions of higher attractant concentration .",
    "although less effective than the adaptive response , the inverted response requires only low receptor sensitivity , and could function in the absence of effective receptors by coupling to the cell metabolism  @xcite . as we show , there are discrepancies between the inverted response and the response observed in aerobically - grown _",
    "r. sphaeroides_.    why do different bacteria exhibit different chemotactic responses ?",
    "one possible reason is that different bacteria have evolved for different environments .",
    "for example , while _ e. coli _ might be expected to inhabit a resource - rich environment , marine bacteria experience a harsh environment in which attractant is localized in short - lasting patches  @xcite with attractant concentration inside patches being 3 to 6 orders of magnitude higher than outside  @xcite .",
    "this has led to a number of marine - specific evolutionary adaptations such as higher running speed in _ pseudomonas haloplanktis _",
    "@xcite and run - and - reverse ( as opposed to run - and - tumble ) chemotaxis in over 70% of marine bacterial species  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , most experimental and theoretical studies to date consider chemotaxis in response to step functions or simple gradients  @xcite , providing limited insights to how chemotaxis would function in different types of environments .",
    "in particular , there have few studies  @xcite analyzing chemotactic strategies in stochastic environments , which are likely to be the most important environment during the evolution of a chemotactic response .    in this work",
    "we construct a model of a stochastic attractant distribution . by adjusting the manner in which attractant",
    "concentrations vary in time and space , the attractant distribution can mimic a range of environments that one might expect to find in nature .",
    "we use this model to study how performance and optimal properties of various chemotactic strategies vary as a function of environmental conditions .",
    "in particular , we describe a new type of chemotactic strategy called the speculator response .",
    "it differs from the adaptive response in that the tumbling rate increases with increasing attractant concentration ; furthermore , the bacterium makes temporal comparisons of attractant concentration which distinguishes the strategy from the inverted response .",
    "we demonstrate the effectiveness of the speculator strategy and its remarkable match to the paradoxical response seen in wild - type , aerobically - grown _",
    "r. sphaeroides _  @xcite .",
    "to model chemotaxis , we consider a single bacterium in a one - dimensional space with periodic boundary conditions and a distribution of attractant .",
    "the bacterium can run to the left or right , or tumble . @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote the rates at which the bacterium starts and stops tumbling .",
    "while @xmath1 is assumed to be constant , the basal rate @xmath2 is modulated by the chemotactic response of the bacterium to the experienced attractant concentrations . in particular , at time @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the chemotactic response function and @xmath6 is the attractant concentration that the bacterium experiences at position @xmath7 at time @xmath3  @xcite .",

    "the constraint @xmath14 results in equal areas of the positive and negative lobes of @xmath5 , ensuring perfect adaptation and a basal tumbling rate ( @xmath18 ) for @xmath19 . in the inverted response ( figure  [ fig : alpha]a , blue curve ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , leading to a single - lobe response function .",
    "this results in a higher tumbling rate in the presence of attractant and a lower rate when attractant is absent , as the blue curve in fig .",

    "we also investigate a new type of response which we name the `` speculator '' response for reasons explained below . in the speculator response ,",

    "this causes increased ( decreased ) tumbling when @xmath6 is increasing ( decreasing ) in time ( figure  [ fig : alpha]b , green curve ) .",
    "the constraint of perfect adaptation is relaxed in the speculator response , so the areas of the positive and negative lobes are unequal ( figure  [ fig : alpha]a , green curve ) .",
    "this allows the steady - state @xmath0 in the presence of constant attractant concentration to be different from @xmath2 , as shown for times @xmath23 ( figure  [ fig : alpha]b , green curve ) .",

    "@xmath24 is the timescale on which attractant concentrations change , while @xmath25 determines the distance between peaks of attractant concentration ; the shorter @xmath25 , the more numerous and narrow the peaks are and the shorter the distances between them .",

    "performance , or fitness , of a response , is equal to the average cell division rate , which we approximate as the inverse of the time it takes the bacterium to experience a specified amount of attractant . for any chemotactic strategy in any stochastic environment",

    "figure  [ fig : fitness ] shows the optimal fitnesses of adaptive , inverted and speculator responses as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "fitnesses are scaled by the fitness of a non - chemotaxing bacterium , whose fitness is independent of @xmath24 and @xmath25 : a bacterium with a relative fitness of 4 therefore takes 4 times less time to experience the same amount of attractant than a non - chemotaxing bacterium . in all strategies",
    ", fitness increases with increasing @xmath24 and decreasing @xmath25 . as @xmath24 increases ,",
    "attractant concentrations change more slowly , making it easier for bacteria to track attractant peaks . at shorter @xmath25 , fitness is higher because there are more attractant peaks and they are closer to one another .",
    "this means that if a bacterium loses track of a peak , or a peak diminishes in amplitude over time , the bacterium only needs to travel a short distance to reach another peak .",
    "in addition to the previously studied adaptive and inverted responses , we characterize a novel chemotactic strategy .",
    "this `` speculator '' response , despite its seemingly paradoxical nature , is more fit under all studied conditions than the inverted response , although less fit than the adaptive response .",
    "interestingly , at @xmath26 , @xmath27 , the fitness of the speculator response is nearly identical to the fitness of the adaptive response . to understand the mechanism of the speculator response",
    ", we consider the optimal values of response parameters ( table  [ tab : response_parameters ] ) .",
    "the lack of perfect adaptation ( optimal @xmath28 ) means that the bacterium will more often start to tumble when the attractant concentration is high , as shown in green in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha]c ; the low value of @xmath1 means that the bacterium will then continue tumbling , remaining in the region of high attractant .",
    "consequently , the speculator response , like the inverted response ( figure  [ fig : alpha]c , blue curve ) , results in frequent long tumbles at high attractant concentrations .",
    "in contrast to the inverted response , the double - lobe response function of the speculator response results in a tumbling rate sensitive to the rate of change of the attractant .",
    "the long memory of the speculator response ( large @xmath10 ) allows sensitivity to long - term trends ; this sensitivity , combined with the double - lobe response function , results in two important dynamical properties .",
    "firstly , the bacterium compares recent attractant concentrations with a long - term average , tumbling more when the recent past is more favorable than the average , and therefore maintaining its position in regions of higher attractant concentration .",
    "secondly , the bacterium is able to sense improving and worsening conditions at its current location . in particular , a decline in the attractant concentration results in a decrease in @xmath0 , allowing the bacterium to swim away from a peak when conditions are changing for the worse .",
    "swimming away leads to a further decrease in @xmath0 , setting a feedback loop in motion , resulting in continued swimming until a new optimum is reached .",
    "the speculator response is therefore analogous to the behavior of investors in financial markets : when the current performance is lower than the average , or when investment values are falling , speculators seek higher returns by abandoning their current position and investing elsewhere  hence the name `` speculator '' response .",
    "the behavior of the speculator response , compared with the adaptive and inverted responses , is illustrated in  .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : response_parameters ]    significantly , the time course of @xmath0 in the speculator response closely matches the time course of probability of tumbling in aerobically - grown _ r. sphaeroides _",

    "[ fig : fitness ] shows , at @xmath26 , @xmath27 , fitnesses of the adaptive and speculator responses are very similar despite the different mechanisms behind their chemotactic strategies .",
    "to better understand these strategies , we create a simple attractant distribution which consists of two gaussians ( at positions 25 and 75 in a world with a length of 100 ) oscillating in amplitude out of phase with each other : when one gaussian is at full amplitude , the other has amplitude of zero .",
    "amplitude , period of oscillation and width of the gaussians are roughly matched to @xmath26 , @xmath27 of the stochastic attractant distribution .",

    ", the bacterium can not track the top of the gaussian as well as in the adaptive response , as evidenced by the large standard deviation around position 25 ( green shading ) .",
    "however , the bacterium more quickly adapts to the changing attractant levels , leaving the declining left gaussian and moving towards the growing right gaussian sooner .",
    "the strengths of the adaptive and speculator responses therefore lie in exploitation and exploration , respectively . in the adaptive response , the bacterium can track the top of a peak efficiently while in the speculator response , the bacterium is better at leaving the declining peak and finding the increasing peak .",
    "the exploitation behavior of the adaptive response is analogous to a hill - climbing algorithm , which efficiently finds , but may get stuck at , a local optimum .",
    "the exploration behavior of the speculator response is more analogous to a monte carlo search algorithm in that the bacterium may leave a peak in search of a higher peak at the cost of its ability to track the peak top efficiently .",
    "this explains the trend in fig .",

    "the sensitivity is lower than in the adaptive response , in agreement with simple models showing that the inverted response is optimized by lower sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "sensitivity needs to be tailored to the range of attractant concentrations the bacterium experiences : if it is too low , the bacterium will run past high concentrations of attractant ; if it is too high , the bacterium will tumble at low concentrations of attractant , never reaching higher concentrations .",
    "in this work we describe a new chemotactic strategy , termed the speculator response , in which the bacterium compares the current attractant concentration with a long - term average ; if the current concentration is higher than the long - term average , the bacterium tumbles persistently to maintain its position . on the other hand ,",
    "declines in the current concentration will increase the probability that the bacterium will swim away to a higher peak . by considering stochastic attractant distributions ,",
    "we show that under slowly - changing but spatially complex attractant concentrations ( large @xmath24 , small @xmath25 ) , the speculator response is almost as efficient at co - localizing with attractant as the adaptive response of _ e. coli _",

    "in contrast to real bacteria , the optimized bacteria have a lower @xmath8 , and thus tumble less than real bacteria when attractant concentration is increasing ( figure  [ fig : alpha]c , red curve , @xmath16 ) .",
    "this may be an artifact of modeling chemotaxis in a one - dimensional environment : in a three - dimensional environment , tumbling may assist the bacterium in finding even steeper paths to attractant optima .",
