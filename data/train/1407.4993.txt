    "a natural question is how the topology of @xmath0 depends on @xmath7 , and one of the first observations is that @xmath8 is divided into finitely many chambers such that length vectors in the same chamber lead to homeomorphic moduli spaces .",
    "one may then ask whether length vectors from different chambers ( up to permutation of coordinates ) have different moduli spaces . _ _    in the planar case @xmath9 walker @xcite conjectured that the cohomology ring of these spaces is enough to distinguish them , which was then confirmed by farber , hausmann and the author in @xcite . furthermore , in @xcite this was also shown for @xmath10 , with the single exception of @xmath11 where for two different chambers the moduli space is the @xmath12-sphere .",
    "indeed , it follows from the work of schoenberg @xcite that for @xmath13 each non - empty moduli space is a sphere , and for @xmath14 the non - empty ones are discs .",
    "the homology calculations of @xcite indicate that for @xmath15 the topology does depend on @xmath7 , but they also show that homology and cohomology are not enough to distinguish them . in @xcite",

    "the remaining case is when @xmath17 is odd . for @xmath16",
    "the moduli spaces are no longer manifolds , so in @xcite a substitute for the cohomology ring using intersection homology was defined . for @xmath3 even specific generators were found and it was shown that this ring is an exterior face ring similar to the situation when @xmath9 .    for odd @xmath3",
    "this ring has an extra generator , which makes the determination of the ring more difficult .",
    "however , this is the same situation as in the case @xmath10 where the cohomology ring was calculated by hausmann and knutson @xcite .",
    "while we do not determine the ring completely , we do obtain enough information to mimick the proof used in @xcite to get the result for @xmath10 , which relied on the cohomology description of @xcite .",
    "a crucial observation is that the extra generator can be thought of as an euler class of a certain stratified bundle over @xmath0 from which its multiplication with the other generators can be deduced .",

    "<S> we consider the moduli spaces @xmath0 of a closed linkage with @xmath1 links and prescribed lengths @xmath2 in @xmath3-dimensional euclidean space . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath4 these spaces are no longer manifolds generically , but they have the structure of a pseudomanifold .    </S>",
    "<S> we use intersection homology to assign a ring to these spaces that can be used to distinguish the homeomorphism types of @xmath0 for a large class of length vectors . </S>",
    "<S> these rings behave rather differently depending on whether @xmath3 is even or odd , with the even case having been treated in an earlier paper . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference in the odd case comes from an extra generator in the ring which can be thought of as an euler class of a startified bundle .    </S>"
