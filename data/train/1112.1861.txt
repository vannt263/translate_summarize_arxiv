    "when the attention is focused on the dissolution ( or growth by precipitation ) of solid particles in liquids , as especially important in pharmaceutical dosage form development , the mass transfer problem may often be simplified by ignoring the effects of convection and phase - change heating such that the governing equations become linear with the `` quasi - stationary '' treatment . thus , the mathematical problem is tractable for deriving analytical solutions as usually desired for engineering evaluations .",
    "moreover , when the mass transfer is mainly limited by the diffusion process rather than the rate of phase change , as often to be the case in several realistic applications , the solute concentration at the particle - medium interface can be assumed to take a constant value of the so - called solubility .",

    "basic understanding of the accuracy and validity of some approximation formulas seems to be lacking in the literature .",
    "the purpose here is to first present a consolidated mathematical formulation of the spherically symmetric mass - transfer problem , then to derive the quasi - stationary approximating equations mainly based on a perturbation procedure for the leading - order effect , and to provide a complete set of exact analytical solutions for the entire parameter range . because the exact solutions can only be written in implicit forms , effort in semi - empirical construction of explicit formulas for the particle radius as a function of time is also made for convenience in engineering practice .",
    "the diffusion - controlled mass transfer to and from a spherical solid particle of ( a time dependent ) radius @xmath0 in an incompressible continuous fluid medium with a constant density @xmath1 and a constant diffusion coefficient @xmath2 is governed by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the mass concentration of the solute ( namely the dissolved solid from the particle ) , @xmath5 the time , and @xmath6 the radial distance from the center of the sphere . in an incompressible fluid with a spherically symmetric flow , the radial velocity is simply @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the ( constant ) solid particle density , to satisfy the equation of continuity and to account for the effect of volume change during the solute phase change ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the solution of @xmath31 to ( 11 ) , which can also be written as @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 noteworthy here is that treating @xmath34 as a time - independent `` variable '' in the zeroth - order diffusion equation is consistent with the so - called `` quasi - stationary '' approximation often used in engineering practice ( where the convection transport is neglected and the diffusion equation is solved with the particle surface being considered stationary ) . here",
    "we ignore the initial condition @xmath38 and consider @xmath34 as a variable yet to be determined .",
    "to evaluate the dissolution process of a particle , we need to consider the first - order effect of @xmath24 at least for @xmath28 in ( 7 ) where only the zeroth - order @xmath31 given by ( [ zero - order - c ] ) is involved , i.e. , @xmath39    as pointed out by @xcite , @xcite , and more recently @xcite ) obtained by @xcite was not noticed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite used their `` highly nonlinear '' implicit formula merely to iteratively determine the value of diffusion coefficient , while @xcite solved the same equation for an analytical solution with the application in drug particle dissolution in mind .",

    "the formula given by ( [ hode_solution ] ) suggests an easy way of generating curves for @xmath34 as a function of @xmath48 by first selecting a series of values of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) to calculate @xmath48 ( according to ( [ hode_solution ] ) ) , and then from the relationship @xmath51 to calculate the corresponding @xmath28 from the given @xmath49 and known @xmath48 .",

    ", @xcite could also carry out derivations of subsequent higher - order perturbation solutions , which would be very difficulty , if not impossible , with the implicit formula ( [ hode_solution ] ) .",
    "now the question is why we can have two apparently different solutions ( [ hode_solution ] ) and ( [ new_solution_r ] ) for the same order of approximation . to make sure ( [ hode_solution ] ) and ( [ new_solution_r ] ) are reasonably equivalent mathematical solutions , it is helpful to check the numerical values with each of the formulas . assuming @xmath62 ( then @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 , ( [ hode_solution ] ) yields @xmath65 and then @xmath66 but ( [ new_solution_r ] ) gives @xmath67 . at @xmath68 , ( [ tcd ] ) predicts the time to complete dissolution @xmath69 when @xmath70 , but the time to complete dissolution based on ( [ new_solution_r ] ) would be @xmath71 ^ 2 $ ] @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we see that ( [ new_solution_r ] ) can not be the same as ( [ hode_solution ] ) at least for @xmath62 .    a careful examination of the derivation of ( 22 ) , however , reveals an error ( which was somehow not corrected by those authors even in several follow - up publications , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the correct expression of ( 22 ) should be @xmath73 therefore , we should have @xmath74 which leads to the same equation as ( [ first - order - r_eq ] ) and solution as ( [ hode_solution ] ) rather than ( [ new_solution_r ] ) .",
    "thus , the same leading - order result can be obtained via seemingly different treatments . for describing the quasi - stationary dissolution process , ( [ hode_solution ] ) should be taken as the correct leading - order solution ( for @xmath45 ) .",
    "it might be noted that so far consideration is only given to the case of @xmath45 , which describes the quasi - stationary dissolution process of a spherical particle .",
    "mathematically , solution also exists for the case of @xmath75 as well as @xmath76 in ( [ first - order - r_eq ] ) . from a physical point of view",
    ", the case of @xmath75 in ( [ first - order - r_eq ] ) describes the inverse process of precipitation growth of a spherical particle , i.e. , when @xmath77 corresponding to the situation of particle growth in a supersaturated solution .",
    "somehow , the exact analytical solution to ( [ first - order - r_eq ] ) for @xmath75 does not seem to have been presented in published literature , unlike the case of @xmath78 .",
    "here it is derived to complete the mathematical solution for ( [ first - order - r_eq ] ) .",

    "the solution to ( [ hode2 ] ) is then @xmath82 ( \\tilde{u}^2 - 1)}\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{u}+1}{\\tilde{u}-1}\\right)^{\\tilde{\\epsilon } }   \\quad ( \\tilde{u } > 1 , \\epsilon < 0 ) \\ , , \\ ] ] which appears to be quite different from ( [ hode_solution ] ) = 2 \\mbox { coth}^{-1 } \\tilde{u}$ ] is used , we can have ( [ hode2_solution ] ) in a similarly looking form to ( [ hode_solution ] ) as @xmath83 ( \\tilde{u}^2 - 1 ) } \\quad ( \\tilde{u } > 1 , \\epsilon < 0 ) \\,\\ ] ] where coth@xmath84 denotes the inverse hyperbolic cotangent function . ] .",
    "as with the dissolution case , curves of @xmath28 can easily be generated by first selecting a series of values of @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) to calculate @xmath48 from ( [ hode2_solution ] ) , and then from the relation @xmath87 to calculate @xmath28 , for the particle growth case .",
    "although the quasi - stationary diffusion - controlled mass transfer problem can be treated as a leading - order perturbation problem , it is noteworthy that the perturbation procedure is only performed on the convection - diffusion equation ( 6 ) in terms of the small parameter @xmath24 such that the neglection of the convection term can be justified in the zeroth - order equation .",
    "in fact , the convection term may naturally disappear in ( 6 ) when @xmath88 ( which might in fact be a quite reasonable assumption especially for a solid solute particle either dissolving in a liquid solvent or growing by precipitation in a supersaturated liquid solution , because the density of solid solute is usually not much different from that of liquid solution , unlike the situation of a liquid droplet in gas or a gas bubble in liquid with orders of magnitude of density differences ) .",
    "in that case , the perturbation treatment in terms of @xmath24 becomes unnecessary ; the `` leading - order '' solution is the exact solution for any value of @xmath24 .",
    "then , ( [ hode2 ] ) and ( [ hode2_solution ] ) with @xmath89 being replaced by @xmath90 are also valid for the case of @xmath91 but with @xmath92 which becomes zero when @xmath93 , where @xmath94 ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath95 , for @xmath96 .",
    "special attention though should be paid at @xmath97 where @xmath98 which has the ( implicit ) solution @xmath99}{u+2 }   \\mbox { or } t = \\frac{\\exp[-4/(u+2)]}{(u+2)^2 } \\quad ( 0 \\le u < \\infty ) \\",

    "as expected , ( [ hode_solution ] ) indeed approaches ( [ hode3_solution ] ) at the limit as @xmath102 by applying lhspital s rule , and so does ( [ hode2_solution ] ) with @xmath89 being replaced by @xmath90 for @xmath91 by using the relationship @xmath103 .",
    "thus , we have a complete set of solutions to ( [ first - order - r_eq ] ) with ( [ hode_solution ] ) for @xmath45 , ( [ hode2_solution ] ) for @xmath75 and @xmath91 ( with @xmath89 being replaced by @xmath90 ) , and ( [ hode3_solution ] ) for @xmath97 , covering all possible @xmath104 ( whenever ignoring the convection term in ( 6 ) is justifiable in practice ) .",
    "moreover , the case of @xmath32 corresponds to a mathematically trivial solution @xmath105 , if desired to be included for completeness .",
    "due to the awkwardness of practical usage of the implicit solution to ( [ first - order - r_eq ] ) , authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) who derived the analytical solution ( for @xmath45 ) often also suggested explicit `` approximate solution '' with the quasi - steady - state treatment ( when the time derivative term in the diffusion equation ( 11 ) is also neglected ) .",
    "simple as it may appear , however , the explicit quasi - steady - state solution may be found not to offer a satisfactory approximation to ( [ hode_solution ] ) for @xmath106 ( depending on the intended application ) . to provide much improved approximate explicit formulas for practically accurate evaluation of @xmath28 ,",
    "effort is made here via a semi - empirical approach .    in view of the physical meanings , the two terms on the right side of ( [ first - order - r_eq ] ) represent two different aspects of the diffusion process : @xmath107 comes from the spherically symmetric steady - state solution of the laplace equation whereas @xmath108 describes transient diffusion from a planar surface .",
    "initially when @xmath109 , the concentration gradient front has not propagated far enough from the particle surface to bring the curvature effect out yet and thus the effect of transient diffusion from a planar surface dominates . with increasing @xmath48 , at some point @xmath110 is expected to happen especially for @xmath25 ; then the steady - state diffusion term becomes dominant and ( 16 ) can be reduced to @xmath111 which is a so - called `` quasi - steady - state '' approximation commonly seen in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
