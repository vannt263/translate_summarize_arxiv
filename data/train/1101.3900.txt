    "<S> the dispersion relation shows a zero gap for carriers with zero momentum in the direction parallel to the barriers in agreement with the well - known `` klein paradox '' . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results for the energy spectrum and the density of states are presented . </S>",
    "<S> those for fermions are appropriate to graphene in which carriers behave relativistically with the `` light speed '' replaced by the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we evaluate the transmission through a finite number of barriers for fermions and zero - spin bosons and relate it with that through a superlattice .    [ 2 ]    \\ {    c # 1 + # 2    .    </S>",
