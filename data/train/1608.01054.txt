    "in 1951 , @xcite found that the light curve of the eclipsing binary rx cas differed in brightness at the maxima proceeding and following the principal minimum .",
    "it was suggested to be caused by tidal effects and an increase in mutual radiation at periastron between stars moving in eccentric orbits ( the so - called periastron effect in close eclipsing binaries ) by @xcite long time ago .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that the effect had no connection with orbital eccentricity but caused by the circumstellar dust and gas .",
    "then , it was called as the oconnell effect .",
    "the oconnell effect commonly appeared on light curves of contact and near contact binaries , which becomes a challenging problem in modeling the eclipsing binary systems .",
    "several theories have been proposed to explain it .",
    "@xcite assumed that the different brightness between the maxima can be explained in terms of the asymmetry of circumfluence in the contact binary star due to the coriolis force .",
    "@xcite suggested that the circumstellar material of a binary system captured by its components is the key factor to cause the oconnell effect .",
    "a star spot model was proposed for w - type systems with asymmetric light curves by @xcite for the first time , and cool spot or hot spot model was widely used in other binary systems since then .",
    "ucac4 436 - 062932 ( = 2mass j15582807 - 0257536 ) is a newly discovered @xcite late - type w uma contact binary . in the present work ,",
    "two sets of @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 bands light curves of ucac4 436 - 062932 with and without oconnell effect are observed and analyzed using the wilson - devinney ( w - d ) code .",
    "basing on the photometric solutions , the basic properties of the binary system is discussed .",
    "we also focus on the origin and evolution of the oconnell effect appears on the light curves to give some evidence which will support the spot model in oconnell effect explanation .",
    "the ccd photometric observations of the eclipsing binary ucac4 436 - 062932 were obtained on 2014 may 23 , june 18 and june 19 using an eev ccd 42 - 40 camera attached to the newtonian focus of the 1.88 m kottamia reflector telescope in egypt @xcite .",
    "the ccd 42 - 40 camera has a format of @xmath6 pixels with a scale of @xmath7 pixel@xmath8 that was cooled by liquid nitrogen to @xmath9c . during the observation ,",
    "the broadband johnson - cousins @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 filters were used .",
    "phot ( measured magnitudes for a list of stars ) of the aperture photometry package in the iraf was used to reduce the observed images .",
    "ucac4 436 - 062934 and ucac4 436 - 062914 were chosen as the comparison and the check stars .",
    "the coordinates and brightness in @xmath0 band of the variable , the comparison and the check stars are listed in table [ coordinates ] .",
    "one of the ccd image in the field of view around ucac4 436 - 062932 are shown in figure 1 , where``v '' refers to the eclipsing binary system , `` c '' to the comparison star and `` ch '' to the check star .",

    "the standard deviation of the fitting residuals is 0.022 mag for @xmath0 band , 0.020 mag for @xmath1 band and 0.017 mag for @xmath2 band , respectively.,width=529 ]     and @xmath2 bands of ucac4 436 - 062932 with oconnell effect .",
    "the standard deviation of the fitting residuals is 0.015 mag for @xmath0 band , 0.014 mag for @xmath1 band and 0.014 mag for @xmath2 band , respectively.,width=529 ]",
    "the two sets of multi - color light curves give nearly consistent results , indicating that ucac4 436 - 062932 is a shallow contact binary system with a low degree of contact ( about @xmath5 ) . the derived mass ratio @xmath10 implies that the ucac4 436 - 062932 is a w - subtype binary system .",
    "the less massive component is about @xmath4 hotter than the more massive one .",
    "the extremely high orbital inclination ( about @xmath11 ) suggests that the eclipse during the primary minimum is a total eclipse and the obtained parameters are very reliable .    in our two sets of light curves",
    ", oconnell effect appears in the light curves observed on 2014 june 18 and june 19 .",
    "however , the light curves observed on 2014 may 23 and june 19 have almost equal brightness at the two maxima .",
    "we try to model the asymmetric light curves ( with oconnell effect ) with spot model , and it really gives a quite satisfying results .",
    "circumstellar matter model suggested by @xcite and some other models can also give quite well fitting results and explanations to the asymmetric light curves .",
    "as considering the two sets of light curves are observed in such a short time ( cover about 30 days ) , the spot model may be more appropriate in the case of ucac4 436 - 062932 for the lifetime of a star spot can be just several ten days .",
    "it is not possible that the effect of circumstellar matter and coriolis force would appear or disappear in a month .",
    "it means that the star spot is not exist or too small to be considered when ucac4 436 - 062932 was observed on 2014 may 23 .",
    "the star spot appeared when we observed the light curves of ucac4 436 - 062932 on 2014 june 18 , thus we obtained light curves with oconnell effect .",
    "however , we ca nt simply conclude that spot model is the only explanatory mechanism for oconnell effect .",
    "in other binary systems , oconnell effect may be mainly dominated by circumstellar matter or coriolis force . to conform this ,",
    "more photometric observations and analysis of light curves with and without oconnell effect are needed in the future .",
