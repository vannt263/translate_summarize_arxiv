    "galaxy spectra encode information on the age and metallicity distributions of the constituent stars , which in turn reflect the star - formation and chemical histories of the galaxies . retrieving",
    "this information from observational data in a reliable way is crucial for a deeper understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the mapping of observed onto physical properties of galaxies has been a major topic of research for over a generation of astronomers since the pioneering works of morgan ( 1956 ) , wood ( 1966 ) and faber ( 1972 ) on the one hand , and tinsley ( 1968 ) and spinrad & taylor ( 1972 ) on the other .",
    "the first group of authors introduced the so - called empirical population synthesis methods , which aim at reproducing a set of observations of a given galaxy by means of a linear combination of simpler systems of known characteristics , like individual stars or chemically homogeneous and coeval groups of stars .",
    "bica ( 1988 ) , pelat ( 1997 ) , cid fernandes ( 2001 ) , moultaka ( 2004 ) are examples of modern studies following this approach .",
    "the second group pioneered the so - called evolutionary population synthesis methods , which compare galaxy data with models that follow the time evolution of an entire stellar system by combining libraries of evolutionary tracks and stellar spectra with prescriptions for the initial mass function ( imf ) , star formation and chemical histories .",
    "this approach has enjoyed more widespread use in recent years , e.g. , arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) , guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange ( 1987 ) , bressan ( 1994 ) , fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) , vazdekis ( 1999 ) , bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , hereafter bc03 ) , le borgne ( 2004 ) , among many others ( see cardiel 2003 for a large set of references ) .",
    "in short , empirical synthesis relies on nature for its basic ingredients , whereas evolutionary synthesis relies mostly on models .",
    "however , since models are made and calibrated to mimic nature , this difference is gradually vanishing as models improve .    besides different methodologies , there are also differences in what type of data is actually modeled .",
    "colours ( e.g. , wood 1966 ) , absorption line equivalent widths or spectral indices ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ; kauffmann 2003 , hereafter k03 ) and emission features , both stellar ( leitherer , robert & heckman 1995 ; schaerer & vacca 1998 ) and nebular ( mas - hesse & kunth 1991 ; kewley 2001 ) , have all been used in stellar population synthesis .",
    "more recently , the full spectral information has been incorporated in the modeling process , both including ( charlot & longhetti 2001 ) , and excluding emission lines ( vazdekis & arimoto 1999 ; reichardt , jimenez & heavens 2001 ; cid fernandes 2004a , hereafter cf04 ) .    recovering the stellar content of a galaxy from its observed integrated spectrum is not an easy task , as can be deduced from the amount of work devoted to this topic over the past @xmath1 half century .",
    "the situation is however much more favorable nowadays .",
    "huge observational and theoretical efforts in the past few years have produced large sets of high quality spectra of stars ( e.g. , prugniel & soubiran 2001 ; le borgne 2003 ; bertone 2004 ; gonzlez delgado 2004 ) .",
    "these libraries are being implemented in a new generation of evolutionary synthesis models , allowing the prediction of galaxy spectra with an unprecedented level of detail ( vazdekis 1999 ; bc03 , le borgne 2004 ) . at the same time ,",
    "galaxy spectra are now more abundant than ever ( loveday 1996 ; york 2000 ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , in particular , is providing a homogeneous data base of hundreds of thousands of galaxy spectra in the 38009200   range , with a resolution of @xmath2 ( york 2000 ; stoughton 2002 ; abazajian 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "this enormous amount of high quality data will undoubtedly be at the heart of tremendous progress in our understanding of galaxy constitution , formation and evolution .",
    "indeed , significant steps in this direction have recently been made ( k03 ; brinchmann 2004 , tremonti 2004 ; heavens 2004 ; panter , heavens & jimenez 2004 ) .    in order to take advantage of the recent progress in evolutionary synthesis to analyze data sets such as the sdss , a methodology must be set up to go from the observed spectra to physical properties of galaxies . in this paper",
    "we discuss one possible method to achieve this goal .",
    "the method is based on fitting an observed spectrum with a linear combination of simple theoretical stellar populations ( coeval and chemically homogeneous ) computed with evolutionary synthesis models at the same spectral resolution as that of the sdss .",
    "our goal here is to demonstrate that , besides providing excellent starlight templates to aid emission line studies , spectral synthesis recovers reliable stellar population properties out of galaxy spectra of realistic quality .",
    "we show that this simple method provides robust information on the stellar age ( @xmath3 ) and stellar metallicities ( @xmath4 ) distributions , as well as on the extinction , velocity dispersion and stellar mass .",
    "the ability to recover information on @xmath4 is particularly welcome , given that stellar metallicities are notoriously more difficult to assess than other properties . in order to reach this goal",
    "we follow : ( 1 ) _ a priori _ arguments , based on simulations ; ( 2 ) comparisons with independent work based on a different method , and ( 3 ) an _ a posteriori _ empirical analysis of the consistency of results obtained for a large sample of sdss galaxies .",
    "other papers in this series on the semi - empirical analysis of galaxies ( seagal ) will explore various astrophysical implications of the results obtained with this method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : synthesis ] presents an overview of our synthesis method and simulations designed to test it and evaluate the uncertainties involved .",
    "the discussion is focused on how to use the synthesis to derive robust estimators of physically interesting stellar population properties .",
    "section [ sec : syntesis_sdss ] defines a volume limited sample of sdss galaxies and presents the results of the synthesis of their spectra , along with measurements of emission lines . in section [ sec : comparisons ] we compare our results to those recently published by brinchmann ( 2004 ) .",
    "stellar population and emission line properties are used in section [ sec : correlations ] to investigate whether the synthesis produces astrophysically plausible results .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our main findings .",
    "our synthesis code , which we call starlight , was first discussed in cf04 ( see also cid fernandes 2004b and garcia - rissman 2005 for different applications of the same code ) .",
    "starlight mixes computational techniques originally developed for empirical population synthesis with ingredients from evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "briefly , we fit an observed spectrum @xmath5 with a combination of @xmath6 simple stellar populations ( ssp ) from the evolutionary synthesis models of bc03 .",
    "extinction is modeled as due to foreground dust , and parametrized by the v - band extinction @xmath7 .",
    "the galactic extinction law of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) with @xmath8 is adopted .",
    "line of sight stellar motions are modeled by a gaussian distribution @xmath9 centered at velocity @xmath10 and with dispersion @xmath11 . with these assumptions",
    "the model spectrum is given by    @xmath12      \\otimes g(v_\\star,\\sigma_\\star)\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the spectrum of the @xmath14 ssp normalized at @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the reddening term , @xmath17 is the synthetic flux at the normalization wavelength , @xmath18 is the _ population vector _ and @xmath19 denotes the convolution operator .",
    "each component @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) represents the fractional contribution of the ssp with age @xmath22 and metallicity .",
    "] @xmath23 to the model flux at @xmath15 .",
    "the base components can be equivalently expressed as a mass fractions vector @xmath24 . in this work",
    "we adopt a base with @xmath25 ssps , encompassing 15 ages between @xmath26 and @xmath27 yr and 3 metallicities : @xmath28 , 1 and 2.5 @xmath29 .",
    "their spectra , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : base ] , were computed with the stelib library ( le borgne 2003 ) , padova 1994 tracks , and chabrier ( 2003 ) imf ( see bc03 for details ) .",
    "the fit is carried out with a simulated annealing plus metropolis scheme which searches for the minimum @xmath30 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath31 is the error in @xmath5 .",
    "regions around emission lines , bad pixels or sky residuals are masked out by setting @xmath32 .",
    "pixels which deviate by more than 3 times the rms between @xmath5 and an initial estimate of @xmath33 are also given zero weight .",
    "the minimization consists of a series of @xmath34 likelihood - guided metropolis explorations of the parameter space . from each iteration to the next we increase the @xmath35 weights geometrically ( which corresponds to a decrease in the `` temperature '' in statistical mechanics terms ; e.g. , mackay 2003 ) .",
    "the step - size in each parameter is concomitantly decreased and the number of steps is increased .",
    "this scheme gradually focuses on the most likely region in parameter space , avoiding ( through the logic of the metropolis algorithm ) trapping onto local minima .",
    "after completion , the whole fit is fine tuned repeating the full loop excluding all @xmath36 components .",
    "an important difference ( from the computational point of view ) with respect to the code in cf04 is that we now perform a series expansion of the @xmath37 extinction factor , which allows a much faster computation of @xmath38 .",
    "naturally , there are a number of technical parameters in this complex fitting algorithm , which we have optimized by means of extensive simulations ( see cf04 ) . at any rate ,",
    "results reported here are robust with respect to variations in these technical parameters .    figs .",
    "[ fig : examples_fits_1 ] and [ fig : examples_fits_2 ] illustrate the spectral fits obtained for two galaxies drawn from the sdss database .",
    "the top - left panel shows the observed spectrum ( thin line ) and the model ( thick ) , as well as the error spectrum ( dashed ) .",
    "the bottom - left panel shows the @xmath39 residual spectrum , while the panels in the right summarize the derived star - formation history encoded in the age - binned population vector .",
    "these examples , along with those in k03 and cf04 , demonstrate that this simple method is capable of reproducing real galaxy spectra to an excellent degree of accuracy .",
    "an important application of the synthesis is to measure emission lines from the residual spectrum , as done by k03 ( see also section [ sec : emissionlines ] ) .",
    "another , of course , is to infer stellar population properties from the fit parameters .",
    "this was not the approach followed by k03 and their subsequent papers , who prefer to derive stellar population properties mainly from the @xmath40 versus h@xmath41 diagram .",
    "our central goal here is to investigate whether spectral synthesis can also recover reliable stellar population properties . in the remainder of this section",
    "we address this issue by means of simulations .",
    "the existence of multiple solutions is an old known problem in stellar population synthesis .",
    "this multiplicity arises from a combination of three factors : ( 1 ) algebraic degeneracy ( number of unknowns larger than number of observables ) , ( 2 ) intrinsic degeneracies of stellar populations and ( 3 ) measurement uncertainties . unlike in methods which synthesize only a handful of spectral indices ,",
    "algebraic degeneracy is not a problem for the method outlined above , as the number of @xmath5 points in any decently sampled spectrum far exceeds the number of parameters even for large bases .",
    "similarly , by modeling the whole spectrum one should be able to alleviate degeneracies in spectral indices associated with different stellar populations ( jimenez 2004 ) .",
    "measurement errors , however , are still a problem",
    ". a corollary of these complications is that even superb spectral fits as those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : examples_fits_1 ] and [ fig : examples_fits_2 ] do not guarantee that the resulting parameter estimates are trustworthy .",
    "this brief discussion illustrates the need to assess the degree to which one can trust the parameters involved in the fit before using them to infer stellar populations properties .",
    "as posed above , the spectral fits involve @xmath42 parameters : @xmath43 of the @xmath18 components ( one degree of freedom is removed by the normalization constraint ) , @xmath17 , @xmath7 and the two kinematical parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the reliability of parameter estimation is best studied by means of simulations which feed the code with spectra generated with known parameters , add noise , and then examine the correspondence between input and output values .",
    "cf04 performed this kind of simulation for a @xmath44 base and spectra in the 35005200   interval .",
    "their analysis concentrated on how well the method recovers @xmath45 for varying degrees of noise .",
    "the main results of that study are : ( 1 ) in the absence of noise , the method recovers all components of @xmath18 to a high degree of accuracy . ( 2 ) in the presence of noise , however , the individual output @xmath20 fractions may deviate drastically from the input values .",
    "essentially , what happens is that noise washes away the differences between spectrally similar components , so it becomes impossible to distinguish them , and the code splits @xmath20 among neighboring components in spectral space .",
    "this is a common problem in population synthesis ( e.g. , panter 2004 ; tremonti 2003 ; cid fernandes 2001 ) .",
    "once we have identified the origin of the problem , the remedy to fix it is evident : bin - over spectrally similar components .",
    "in other words , instead of attempting a fine graded description of stellar populations mixtures in terms of many ages and metallicities , it is much better to `` marginalize over the details '' and work with a coarser but more robust description based on combined @xmath20 fractions .",
    "as shown by cf04 , condensed versions of the population vector which project its @xmath6 components onto just a few physically interesting axes , yield very reliable results .",
    "our approach and objectives are conceptually similar to those of the moped code of heavens , jimenez & lahav ( 2000 ; see also reichardt 2001 , panter 2004 ) . operationally , however , the two codes differ . moped compresses data on input by degrading the sdss spectral resolution to 20   and performing weighted linear combinations of @xmath5 , reducing its dimension to one datum per output parameter while at the same time minimizing the loss of information .",
    "starlight , on the other hand , works with the spectrum at its full resolution and an overdimensioned set of parameters ( i.e. , large @xmath6 ) , which we compress on the description of the output .",
    "the disadvantage of our approach is computational .",
    "indeed , it is described as a `` slow '' and `` brute force '' method by panter ( 2004 ) .",
    "this , however , is not a severe problem given the abundance of cpus nowadays ( starlight takes about 4 minutes per galaxy on a 2 ghz linux - workstation ) .",
    "furthermore , there is plenty of room for improvement in the efficiency of the algorithm , for instance , by implementing a smarter exploration of the parameter space ( slosar & hobson 2003 ) , to the point that computational constraints could soon become a minor concern .",
    "an advantage of starlight is that it also measures kinematical parameters ( mainly @xmath11 ) and provides a high resolution template spectrum .",
    "we have carried out new simulations designed to test the method and investigate which combinations of the parameters provide robust results .",
    "these simulations differ from those in cf04 in three main aspects : ( 1 ) the spectral range is now 36508000  ; ( 2 ) the new base is larger ; ( 3 ) a more realistic error spectrum was used .",
    "a further difference is that we use a larger number of iterations , partly because we have more base elements than cf04 and partly because the code is now over 200 times faster . at each step in the annealing scheme ,",
    "the number of steps per parameter is set to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the length of the allowed range for the parameter ( e.g. , @xmath48 for @xmath20 fractions , which range from 0 to 1 ) , and @xmath49 is the step - size ( see cf04 for a more detailed description of these technical aspects ) .",
    "this insures that each parameter can in principle random - walk twice its whole allowed range , which is an adequate criterion for metropolis sampling ( e.g. , mackay 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , there are 12 stages in the annealing schedule .",
    "overall , over @xmath50 combinations of parameters are sampled for each galaxy .",
    "several sets of simulations were performed . given our interest in modeling sdss galaxies , here we focus on simulations tailored to match the characteristics of this data set .",
    "test galaxies were built from the average @xmath18 , @xmath7 and @xmath11 within 65 boxes in the mean stellar age versus mean stellar metallicity plane obtained for the sample described in section [ sec : syntesis_sdss ] .",
    "each spectrum covers the 36508000   range in steps of 1  , the same sampling of the bc03 models .",
    "we generate 20 perturbed versions of each synthetic spectrum for each of 5 levels of noise : @xmath51 , 10 , 15 , 20 and 30 , where @xmath52 is the signal - to - noise ratio per in the region around @xmath53  . unlike in cf04 , who used a flat error spectrum ,",
    "the error at each @xmath54 was assumed to follow a gaussian distribution with amplitude obtained by scaling a normalized mean sdss error spectrum to yield the desired @xmath52 at @xmath15 .",
    "this error spectrum decreases by a factor of @xmath55 from 3650 to 6200   and then increases again by @xmath56 towards 8000  .",
    "finally , as for the actual data fits , we mask points around @xmath573726,3729 , @xmath58 , h@xmath49 , h@xmath59 , h@xmath60 , h@xmath61 , @xmath574959,5007 , @xmath62 , nad@xmath63 , @xmath546300 , @xmath54@xmath546548,6583 , h@xmath0 , @xmath576717,6731 .",
    "these new simulations confirm that the individual components of @xmath18 are very uncertain , so we skip a detailed comparison between @xmath45 and @xmath64 and jump straight to results based on more robust descriptions of the synthesis output .",
    "a coarse but robust description of the star - formation history of a galaxy may be obtained by binning @xmath18 onto `` young '' ( @xmath65 yr ) , `` intermediate - age '' ( @xmath66 yr ) , and `` old '' ( @xmath67 yr ) components ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively ) .",
    "these age - ranges were defined on the basis of the simulations , by seeking which combinations of @xmath20 s produce smaller input @xmath71 output residuals .",

    "this is the reason why studies of the stellar populations of galaxies have a much harder time estimating metallicities than ages , to the point that one is often forced to bin - over the @xmath113 information and deal only with age - related estimates such as @xmath112 ( e.g. , cid fernandes 2001 ; cid fernandes , leo & rodrigues lacerda 2003 ; k03 ) .",
    "notwithstanding these notes , it is clear that uncertainties of @xmath114 dex in @xmath111 are actually good news , since they do allow us to recover useful information on an important but hard to measure property .",
    "this new tracer of stellar metallicity is best applicable to large samples of galaxies such as the sdss .",
    "the statistics of samples help reducing uncertainties associated with @xmath111 estimates for single objects and allows one to investigate correlations between @xmath111 and other galaxy properties ( sodr , in preparation ; section [ sec : stellar_x_nebular_metallicities ] ) .",
    "our method tends to underestimate @xmath111 for metal - rich systems and vice - versa .",
    "this bias is due to the infamous age - metallicity degeneracy . in order to verify to which degree our synthesis",
    "is affected by this well known problem ( e.g. , renzini & buzzoni 1986 ; worthey 1994 ; bressan , chiosi & tantalo 1996 ) we have examined the correlation between the output minus input residuals in @xmath115 and @xmath83 .",
    "the age-@xmath113 degeneracy acts in the sense of confusing old , metal - poor systems with young , metal - rich ones and vice - versa , which should produce anti - correlated residuals .",
    "these are indeed seen in figure [ fig : age_z_degeneracy ] , where small symbols represent all 1300 individual simulations and filled circles correspond to the mean residuals obtained for each set of 20 perturbations of the 65 test galaxies .",
    "this anti - correlation is also present with the mass - weighted mean stellar metallicity @xmath116 , but is not as strong as for @xmath117 . on the other hand ,",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath116 is always larger than for @xmath117 ( table [ tab : parameter_uncertainties ] ) .",
    "the age-@xmath113 degeneracy is thus present in our method , introducing systematic biases in our @xmath111 and @xmath112 estimates at the level of up to @xmath1180.2 dex .",
    "none of the results reported in this paper rely on this level of precision .",
    "we have also carried out a separate set of simulations for 100 test galaxies generated by random combinations of @xmath18 , @xmath7 , @xmath11 .",
    "these simulations differ from the ones presented above in that the test galaxies are not restricted to match the range of properties inferred from the application of the synthesis to sdss galaxies ( section [ sec : syntesis_sdss ] ) . given that these random galaxies span a broader ( but less representative of our sample galaxies ) region of the parameter space",
    ", one might expect to find larger uncertainties in the derived properties .",
    "this was indeed confirmed in the numerical experiments , although the effect is small .",
    "the uncertainties in the @xmath119 binned fractions increase by just a couple of percentage points with respect to those in table [ tab : parameter_uncertainties ] .",
    "similarly , the increase in @xmath120 is of just 0.02 mag , while @xmath121 and @xmath122 increase by @xmath123 and 0.03 dex respectively .",
    "the only properties whose uncertainties are substantially larger that those reported in table [ tab : parameter_uncertainties ] are the stellar mass and velocity dispersion . for instance , while the sdss - based simulations for @xmath102 yield @xmath124 dex and @xmath125 km@xmath97s@xmath98 , with random galaxies these errors increase to 0.15 dex and 24 km@xmath97s@xmath98 respectively .",
    "the reason for this apparent discrepancy is due to the fact that the set of random test - galaxies contains a larger proportion of systems dominated by very young stellar populations than we find for sdss galaxies .",
    "an error @xmath126 in the light fraction associated to these populations must be compensated by errors in the older components , which carry most of the mass , even when @xmath68 is large .",
    "as illustrated by the size of the error - bars in figure [ fig : input_x_ouput_1 ] , @xmath126 increases as @xmath68 increases , so the errors in the mass fractions components increase too , leading to larger dispersion in @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , galaxies with large @xmath68 have few absorption features to constrain the kinematical broadening of the spectrum , which explains the larger dispersion in our @xmath11 estimates .",
    "to prove this point , we have re - evaluated the uncertainties in @xmath92 and @xmath11 excluding test galaxies with @xmath127% , which corresponds to systems which formed @xmath128% of their stellar mass over the past @xmath129 yr . for this subset of the simulations , which comprise 72 galaxies ( each one split onto 20 different spectra corresponding to independent monte carlo realizations of the noise ) , the uncertainties in mass and velocity dispersion decrease to @xmath130 dex and @xmath131 km@xmath97s@xmath98 ( for @xmath132 ) , only slightly larger than those reported in section [ sec : mass_and_vd ] . uncertainties in other properties",
    "also decrease to values very similar to those listed in table [ tab : parameter_uncertainties ] .",
    "we thus conclude that the parameter uncertainties studied in section [ sec : robustdecription ] and summarized in table [ tab : parameter_uncertainties ] are only moderately affected by the design of the simulations , and represent fair estimates of the limitations of our synthesis method .",
    "finally , we have carried out simulations using the @xmath133 bc03 ssps to generate further test galaxies .",
    "galaxies with such low metallicity are not expected to be present in significant numbers in the sample described in section [ sec : sample_definition ] , given that it excludes low luminosity systems like hii galaxies and dwarf ellipticals ( which are also the least metallic ones by virtue of the mass - metallicity relation ) .",
    "still , it is interesting to investigate what would happen in this case . when synthesized with our 0.2@xmath134 base ( fig .",
    "[ fig : base ] ) , these extremely metal poor galaxies are modeled predominantly with the @xmath135 components , as intuitively expected .",
    "moreover , the mismatch in metallicity introduces non - negligible biases in other properties , like masses , mean ages and extinction ( @xmath92 , for instance , is systematically underestimated by 0.3 dex ) .",
    "similar problems should be encountered when modeling systems with @xmath136 .",
    "these results serve as a reminder that our base spans a wide but finite range in stellar metallicity , and that extrapolating these limits has an impact on the derived physical properties .",
    "while there is no straightforward _ a priori _ diagnostic of which galaxies violate these limits , in general , one should be suspicious of objects with mean @xmath4 too close to the base limits .      summarizing this theoretical study ,",
    "we have performed simulations designed to evaluate the accuracy of our spectral synthesis method .",
    "the simulations mimic in as much as possible the wavelength range , spectral resolution , error spectrum , and @xmath52 of the actual sdss data studied below .",
    "several physically motivated combinations of the synthesis parameters were investigated to establish their precision at different @xmath52 .",
    "table [ tab : parameter_uncertainties ] summarizes the uncertainties in these quantities and a few additional ones not explicitly mentioned above . in what follows we focus on 5 parameters : stellar mass , velocity dispersion , extinction , mean",
    "stellar ages and metallicities , all of which were found to be adequately recovered .",
    "this exercise demonstrates that we are capable of producing reliable estimates of several parameters of astrophysical interest , at least in principle .",
    "we must nevertheless emphasize that this conclusion relies entirely on models and on an admittedly simplistic view of galaxies .",
    "when applying the synthesis to real galaxy spectra , a series of other effects come into play .",
    "for instance , the extinction law appropriate for each galaxy likely differs from the one used here : in our galaxy , the ratio of total to selective extinction of stellar sources , @xmath137 , is known to depend on the line of sight ( cardelli 1989 ; patriarchi 2001 ) ; in addition , the wavelength dependence of the attenuation of light from an extended source such as a galaxy includes the effects of scattering back into the light beam , and depends on the relative distribution of stars and dust ( witt 1992 ; gordon 1997 ) .",
    "also , one might expect that each population of stars is affected by a distinct extinction ( panuzzo 2003 ; charlot & fall 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , while in the evolutionary tracks adopted here the metal abundances are scaled from the solar values , non - solar abundance mixtures are known to occur in stellar systems ( e.g. , trager 2000a , b ) , not to mention uncertainties in the ssp models and the always present issue of the imf . in short , evidence against these simplifying hypothese abound .",
    "accounting for all these effects in a consistent way is not currently feasible .",
    "we mention these caveats not to dismiss simple models , but to highlight that all parameter uncertainties discussed above are applicable within the scope of the model . hence , while the simulations lend confidence to the synthesis method , one might remain skeptical of its actual power .",
    "the next sections further address the reliability of the synthesis , this time from a more empirical perspective .",
    "in this section we apply our synthesis method to a large sample of sdss galaxies to estimate their stellar population properties .",
    "we also present measurements of emission line properties , obtained from the observed minus synthetic spectra .",
    "the information provided by the synthesis of so many galaxies allows one to address a long menu of astrophysical issues related to galaxy formation and evolution . before venturing in the exploration of such issues , however , it is important to validate the results of the synthesis by as many means as possible .",
    "hence , the goal of the study presented below is not so much to explore the physics of galaxies but to provide an empirical test of our synthesis method .",
    "the results reported in this section are used in sections [ sec : comparisons ] and [ sec : correlations ] with this purpose .",
    "the spectroscopic data used in this work were taken from the sdss .",
    "this survey provides spectra of objects in a large wavelength range ( 38009200  ) with mean spectral resolution @xmath138 , taken with 3 arcsec diameter fibers .",
    "the most relevant characteristic of this survey for our study is the enormous amount of good quality , homogeneously obtained spectra .",
    "the data analyzed here were extracted from the sdss main galaxy sample available in the data release 2 ( dr2 ; abazajian 2004 ) .",
    "this flux - limited sample consists of galaxies with reddening - corrected petrosian @xmath139-band magnitudes @xmath140 , and petrosian @xmath139-band half - light surface brightnesses @xmath141 mag arcsec@xmath142 ( strauss 2002 ) .    from the main sample , we first selected spectra with a redshift confidence @xmath143 .",
    "following the conclusions of zaritsky , zabludoff , & willick ( 1995 ) , we have imposed a redshift limit of @xmath144 ( trying to avoid aperture effects and biases ; see e.g. gmez 2003 ) and selected a volume limited sample up to @xmath145 , corresponding to a @xmath139-band absolute magnitude limit of @xmath146 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes used here are k - corrected with the help of the code provided by blanton ( 2003 ; ` kcorrect v3_2 ` ) and assuming the following cosmological parameters : @xmath147 = 70 km",
    "s@xmath98 mpc@xmath98 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "we also restricted our sample to objects for which the observed spectra show a @xmath52 ratio in @xmath150 , @xmath139 and @xmath151 bands greater than 5 .",
    "these restrictions leave us with a volume limited sample containing @xmath152 galaxies , which leads to a completeness level of @xmath1 98.5 per cent .",
    "all 50362 spectra were brought to the rest - frame ( using the redshifts in the sdss database ) , sampled from 3650 to 8000   in steps of 1  , corrected for galactic extinction using the maps given by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) and the extinction law of cardelli ( 1989 , with @xmath153 , and normalized by the median flux in the 40104060   region .",
    "the @xmath52 ratio in this spectral window spans the 530 range , with median value of 14 . besides the masks around the lines listed in section [ sec : simulations ] , we exclude points with sdss flag @xmath154 , which signals bad pixels , sky residuals and other artifacts .",
    "after this pre - processing , the spectra are fed into the starlight code described in section [ sec : synthesismethod ] . on average ,",
    "the synthesis is performed with @xmath155 points , after discounting the ones which are clipped by our @xmath156 sigma threshold ( typically 40 points ) and the masked ones .",
    "the spectral fits are generally very good , as illustrated in figs.[fig : examples_fits_1 ] and [ fig : examples_fits_2 ] .",
    "the mean value of @xmath89 is 0.78 .",
    "in fact , this is somewhat too good , since from the simulations we expect @xmath157 .",
    "this is a minor difference , which could be fixed decreasing the errors in @xmath5 by @xmath158% .",
    "we further quantify the quality of the fits by @xmath90 , the mean value of @xmath159 over all non - masked points . from the simulations we expect this alternative figure of merit to be of order of 0.6 times the noise - to - signal ratio at @xmath15 ( table [ tab : parameter_uncertainties ] ) .",
    "this is exactly the mean value of @xmath160 in the actual fits , again indicating acceptable fits .",
    "the total stellar masses of the galaxies were obtained from the stellar masses derived from the spectral synthesis ( which correspond to the light entering the fibers ) by dividing them by @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the fraction of the total galaxy luminosity in the @xmath163-band outside the fiber .",
    "this approach , which neglects stellar population and extinction gradients , leads to an increase of typically 0.5 in @xmath80 .",
    "we did not apply any correction to the velocity dispersion estimated by the code given that the spectral resolution of the bc03 models and the data are very similar .",
    "we point out that we did not constrain the extinction @xmath7 to be positive .",
    "there are several reasons for this choice : ( a ) some objects may be excessively dereddened by galactic extinction ; ( b ) some objects may indeed require bluer ssp spectra than those in the base ; ( c ) the observed light may contain a scattered component , which would induce a bluening of the spectra not taken into account by the adopted pure extinction law ; ( d ) constraining @xmath7 to have only positive values produces an artificial concentration of solutions at @xmath164 , an unpleasant feature in the @xmath7 distribution .",
    "interestingly , most of the objects for which we derive negative @xmath7 ( typically @xmath165 to @xmath166 mag ) are early - type galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are dominated by old populations , and expected to contain little dust .",
    "this is consistent with the result of k03 , who find negative extinction primarily in galaxies with a large @xmath40 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 for these objects , which can be selected on the basis of spectral or morphological properties , is strongly peaked around @xmath167 , so that objects with @xmath168 can be considered as consistent with having zero extinction . in any case",
    ", none of the results reported in this paper is significantly affected by this choice .",
    "besides providing estimates of stellar population properties , the synthesis models allow the measurement of emission lines from the `` pure - emission '' , starlight subtracted spectra @xmath169 .",
    "we have measured the lines of @xmath573726,3729 , @xmath544363 , h@xmath61 , @xmath574959,5007 , @xmath546300 , @xmath546548 , h@xmath0 , @xmath546584 and @xmath576717,6731 .",
    "each line was treated as a gaussian with three parameters : width , offset ( with respect to the rest - frame central wavelength ) , and flux .",
    "lines from the same ion were assumed to have the same width and offset .",
    "we have further imposed @xmath170/@xmath171 and @xmath172/@xmath173 flux ratio constraints .",
    "finally , we consider a line to have significant emission if its fit presents a @xmath52 ratio greater than 3 .    in some of the following analysis ,",
    "galaxies with emission lines are classified according to their position in the /h@xmath61 versus /h@xmath0 diagram proposed by baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( 1981 ) to distinguish normal star - forming galaxies from galaxies containing active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "we define as normal star - forming galaxies those galaxies that appear in this diagram and are below the curve defined by k03 ( see also brinchmann 2004 ) .",
    "objects above this curve are transition objects and galaxies containing agn .",
    "a point that deserves mention here is the bias that may be introduced in the analysis due to the use of small fibers to measure the galaxy spectra .",
    "this effect , known as aperture bias , may introduce a redshift dependence in the measured galaxy spectra , since the fraction of galaxy light received by a fiber increases with increasing distance .",
    "zaritsky ( 1995 ) , based on an analysis of spectra from the las campanas redshift survey , find that a lower limit on redshifts of @xmath174 minimizes the aperture bias .",
    "this effect has also been discussed by k03 , gmez ( 2003 ) and tremonti ( 2004 ) for sdss spectra .",
    "for instance , these authors found that the galaxy @xmath163-band @xmath101 ratio and the gas - phase oxygen abundance decrease by @xmath1 0.1 dex over the redshift range of the survey , indicating that these quantities are moderately affected by aperture bias . the redshift range considered in our study is smaller than that of the entire survey , implying that the aperture effects are expected to be even smaller in our sample .    in order to verify whether our results are significantly affected by this bias , we investigated the behaviour of some of the quantities resulting from our analysis ( @xmath92 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath7 ) as a function of redshift for galaxies with luminosities above and below @xmath175 , the median luminosity of our sample .",
    "we divided the sample in several redshift bins containing the same number of objects , and computed the median value and the quartiles of each quantity in each bin .",
    "[ fig : aperturebias ] shows as solid lines the median values of each distribution , as well as their respective quartiles .",
    "none of the quantities seems to be strongly affected by this bias .",
    "the largest correlation with @xmath163 appears for light - weighted ages , corresponding to a change along our redshift distribution of about @xmath176 and @xmath177 dex for faint and bright galaxies , respectively .",
    "this is a plausible result since the light of nearby objects seen by the fiber aperture is dominated by the older stellar populations of their bulges . for the other quantities the variations are well below 0.1 dex .",
    "the sdss database has been explored by several groups , using different approaches and techniques .",
    "the mpa / jhu group has recently publicly released catalogues of derived physical properties for 211894 sdss galaxies , including 33589 narrow - line agn ( k03 , see also brinchmann 2004 ) .",
    "these catalogues are based on the k03 method to infer the star formation histories , dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies from the simultaneous analysis of the 4000   break strength , @xmath40 , and the balmer line absorption index h@xmath41 .",
    "these two indices are used to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few gyr , and a comparison with broad - band photometry then allows to estimate the extinction and stellar masses .",
    "the mpa / jhu catalogues provide very useful benchmarks for similar studies . in this section",
    "we compare the values of some of the parameters from these catalogues with our own estimates .",
    "catalogues of galaxy properties obtained with our synthesis method will be made available in due course . besides comparing directly measurements of physical quantities ,",

    "this discrepancy is only apparent .",
    "the galactic extinction law is substantially harder than @xmath181 .",
    "one thus expects to need less extinction when modeling a given galaxy with the former law than with the latter .",

    "since the @xmath186 conversion factors are 0.7030 and 0.4849 for the @xmath181 and cardelli laws , one finds that the @xmath180 values obtained for the two laws should differ by a factor of @xmath187 .",
    "this is very close to the empirically derived factor of 2.51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comparisons_av ] ) .",

    "it is worth stressing that these two quantities are obtained independently , since the spectral synthesis does not include emission lines .",
    "another quantity that is considered a good age indicator , even for galaxies without emission lines , is the 4000   break , d4000 .",
    "we measured this index following bruzual ( 1983 ) , who define d4000 as the ratio between the average value of @xmath208 in the 40504250 and 37503950   bands .",

    ", @xmath11 has contributions of isotropic motions in the bulges , as well as of the rotation of the disks , and is also expected to relate with galactic mass .",
    "another aspect that it is interesting to point out in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass - sigma ] is that the dispersion in the @xmath92@xmath11 relation decreases as we go from low - luminosity , rotation - dominated systems , for which the values of @xmath11 depend on galaxy inclination and bulge - to - disk ratio , to high - luminosity , mostly early - type systems , which obey a much more regular ( and steeper ) relation between @xmath11 and @xmath92 .",
    "this relation , between a quantity that is not directly linked to the synthesis , @xmath11 , and another one that is a product of our synthesis , @xmath92 , is yet another indication that the results of our starlight code do make sense .    .",
    "we have developed and tested a method to fit galaxy spectra with a combination of spectra of individual simple stellar populations generated with state - of - the art evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "the main goal of this investigation was to examine the reliability of physical properties derived in this way .",
    "this goal was pursued by three different means : simulations , comparison with independent studies , and analysis of empirical results .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "simulations tailored to match the characteristics of sdss spectra show that the individual ssp strengths , encoded in the population vector @xmath18 , are subjected to large uncertainties , but robust results can be obtained by compressing @xmath18 into coarser but useful indices . in particular ,",
    "physically motivated indices such as mean stellar ages and metallicities are found to be well recovered by spectral synthesis even for relatively noisy spectra .",
    "stellar masses , velocity dispersion and extinction are also found to be accurately retrieved .",
    "we have applied our starlight code to a volume limited sample of over 50000 galaxies from the sdss data release 2 .",
    "the spectral fits are generally very good , and allow accurate measurements of emission lines from the starlight subtracted spectrum .",
    "catalogues of physical and emission line properties derived for this sample will be made available in due course .",
    "we also report that work is underway to produce a flexible , user friendly and publicly available version of starlight .",
    "we have compared our results to those obtained by the mpa / jhu group ( k03 ; brinchmann 2004 ) with a different method to characterize the stellar populations of sdss galaxies .",
    "the stellar extinctions and masses derived in these two studies are very strongly correlated .",
    "furthermore , differences in the values of @xmath7 and @xmath92 are found to be mostly due to the differences in the model ingredients ( extinction law ) .",
    "our estimates of stellar velocity dispersions and emission line properties are also in good agreement with those of the mpa / jhu group .",
    "the confidence in the method is further strengthened by several empirical correlations between synthesis results and independent quantities .",
    "we find strong correlations between stellar and nebular metallicites , stellar and nebular extinctions , mean stellar age and the equivalent width of h@xmath0 , mean stellar age and the 4000   break , stellar mass and velocity dispersion .",
