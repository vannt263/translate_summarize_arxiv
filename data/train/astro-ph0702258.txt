    "globular clusters are dense spherical gravitationally - bound stellar clusters . by virtue of the age of the oldest clusters ( @xmath10gyr ) , they are invaluable probes into the earliest evolutionary stages of their host galaxy . in that context however",
    ", the original properties of ( systems of ) globular clusters will have been modified by the effects of a hubble - time of evolution in their galactic environment .",
    "it is essential to disentangle formation from evolution . how the present - day globular cluster mass distribution in a large galaxy compares with the initial one constitutes one such striking example .",
    "the cluster mass function , , while we refer to the mass _ function _ to describe the number of objects per _ logarithmic _ mass interval @xmath11 . ]",
    "namely , the cluster number per constant logarithmic cluster mass interval @xmath12 , which is proportional to the number of objects per magnitude unit , constitutes a primary characteristic of any globular cluster system hosted by a massive galaxy .",
    "intriguingly , it shows only a weak dependence on the size , the morphological type or the environment of the host galaxy ( ashman & zepf 1998 , harris 1999 ) . this universal globular cluster mass function",
    "is usually fitted with a gaussian with a mean of @xmath13 and a standard deviation of @xmath14 .",
    "the underlying mass spectrum ( i.e. , the number of objects per _ linear _ mass interval ) is well described by a two - index power - law , with exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 above and below @xmath17 m@xmath18 , respectively ( mclaughlin 1994 ) .",
    "the peak of the gaussian function in fact coincides with the cluster mass at which the slope of the mass spectrum changes .    individual globular clusters and globular cluster systems having evolved over a hubble - time in their galactic environment , the globular cluster initial mass function has remained model - dependent , with two competing hypotheses .",
    "it may have been a featureless power - law with a slope of @xmath19 , the gaussian function characteristic of old globular cluster populations then resulting from evolutionary effects , predominantly the preferential removal of the more vulnerable low - mass clusters ( fall & zhang 2001 ) . in that case , the cluster mass at the turnover of the present - day mass function depends on the age of the cluster system as well as on the cluster disruption time - scale in the galaxy of relevance . the older the cluster system and/or the shorter the disruption time - scale , the higher the cluster mass at the mass function turnover . in this situation ,",
    "vesperini ( 2001 ) shows that it is not straightforward to produce ( almost ) universal globular cluster mass functions in very different types of galaxies if starting from an initial featureless power - law .",
    "alternatively , vesperini ( 1998 ) demonstrates that the present - day cluster mass function represents an equilibrium state `` able to preserve its initial shape and parameters for one hubble - time through a subtle balance between disruption of clusters and evolution of the masses of the surviving ones '' , even though a significant fraction of the initial cluster population has been destroyed .",
    "that is , the initial cluster mass function may also be a gaussian similar to that today .",
    "should that be the case , the observed gaussian shape of the cluster mass function and its universality among galaxies are the preserved imprints of the globular cluster formation process .",
    "parmentier & gilmore ( 2005 ) and vesperini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) provide evidence for a gaussian cluster initial mass function in the galactic halo and in the giant elliptical m87 , respectively . theoretical support for a general bell - shaped cluster initial mass function",
    "has been missing so far however .",
    "the cluster initial mass function has often been assumed to mirror the mass function of the cluster gaseous progenitors ( mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 , elmegreen & falgarone 1996 , elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .",
    "however , this is true only if all the cluster forming clouds turn the gas they are made of into bound star clusters with roughly the same efficiency . at its earliest stages , a protostellar cluster is embedded in the left - over star forming gas . that residual gas is blown away once the newly formed massive stars explode as supernovae . as a result of the corresponding weakening of its gravitational potential , the protocluster can emerge unbound from the violent relaxation phase which follows . by means of analytical computations , hills ( 1980 )",
    "predicted that , in the case of instantaneous gas removal , shorter than a protocluster crossing - time @xmath20 , implying that the stars do not have time to adjust to the new gravitational potential .",
    "their velocity dispersions before and immediately after gas loss are thus considered to be the same . ]",
    "initially virialized systems eventually dissolve for star forming efficiencies ( i.e. , the mass fraction of gas ending up in stars , hereafter @xmath0 ) smaller than 50% .",
    "that is , star forming clouds must be better than 50% efficient in converting gas into stars in order to produce bound stellar clusters . the limited variations in @xmath0 ( i.e. , less than a factor of 2 ) may then guarantee that the initial mass function of the clusters is that of their parent clouds , shifted downwards by a factor of @xmath21 .",
    "using @xmath22-body simulations however , lada , margulis & dearborn ( 1984 ) revisited that issue and pointed out that a system which becomes globally unbound due to a less than 50% efficiency is not necessarily completely disrupted and may retain a core of bound stars .",
    "conversely , even a star forming efficiency larger than 50% does not prevent the protocluster from losing a fraction of its stars .",
    "this is due to the fact that the protocluster stars are characterized by a velocity distribution .",
    "the stars in the low - velocity tail of the distribution tend to survive as a gravitationally bound entity even if @xmath23 , while high - velocity stars escape even if @xmath24 . as a result",
    ", the initial mass of a stellar cluster is not determined by the star formation efficiency only .",
    "it depends on the mass fraction of the cluster parent cloud which is turned into stars _ which remain bound after the dispersal of the gaseous component_.    modelling the dynamical evolution of gas - embedded clusters , that is , how they respond to supernova activity , has since then attracted considerable attention ( verschueren 1989 , goodwin 1997 , geyer & burkert 2001 , boily & kroupa 2003 , fellhauer & kroupa 2005 ) .",
    "surprisingly however , whether the early evolution of gas - embedded protoclusters influences the cluster initial mass function , that is , the mass function of the emerging gas - free bound groups of stars , has remained poorly explored ( kroupa & boily 2002 ) . since the initial mass of a star cluster depends on gas removal , gas mass loss is actually worth being put to the test as a possible controlling mechanism of the globular cluster initial mass function .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "impact ] , we present the results of monte - carlo simulations highlighting the impact of gas removal upon the shape of the globular cluster initial mass function with respect to that of their gaseous progenitors .",
    "we also discuss how variations in the different model parameters affect the cluster initial mass function . in sect .",
    "[ sec : gal_halo ] , we apply our model to the specific case of the galactic stellar halo . finally , we present our conclusions in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclu ] .",
    "the formation of a stellar cluster is terminated when the newly formed massive stars go supernovae and blow away the gas left - over by the star formation process . following the dispersal of that residual gas ,",
    "the stars suddenly find themselves in a shallower gravitational potential , entailing either the escape of some of them , or even the complete destruction of the protocluster . if the gas is removed explosively ( i.e. @xmath25 )",
    ", the star formation efficiency must be larger than a threshold value @xmath26% ( see below and fig .  [ fig : fb_sfe ] ) for the protocluster to retain a bound core of stars .",
    "the mass fraction @xmath27 of stars remaining bound after gas removal ranges from zero ( when the efficiency @xmath0 is at its threshold value , or lower , i.e. @xmath28 ) up to unity ( when @xmath29 , so that gas removal is just a small perturbation of the stellar system ) . considering the case of initially virialized gas - embedded protoclusters , various studies ( lada et al .",
    "1984 , geyer & burkert 2001 , boily & kroupa 2003 , fellhauer & kroupa 2005 ) have led to fairly consistent results regarding the @xmath27 vs. @xmath0 relation ( see the plain symbols in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the knowledge of this relation enables us to relate the initial mass @xmath30 of a gas - free bound star cluster to the mass @xmath31 of its gaseous progenitor , namely : @xmath32 as a result of the large variations in the bound star formation efficiency @xmath33 , an assumed simple mapping between the mass function of the cluster gaseous precursors on the one hand and the initial mass function of the clusters on the other hand can no longer be taken for granted .",
    "we now investigate how the cluster initial mass function differs with respect to the protoglobular cloud mass function as a result of gas removal .      in what follows ,",
    "we assume that the protoglobular cloud mass spectrum obeys a power - law @xmath34 with @xmath35 varying between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as is observed for giant molecular clouds and their star forming cores in the local group of galaxies ( e.g. rosolowski 2005 , see also section [ subsec : isoqfgc_mlowmup ] ) .",
    "a power - law mass spectrum may result from the coalescence of initially small equal - mass cores into a system of more massive objects with a wide range of masses ( mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 ) .",
    "alternatively , elmegreen & falgarone ( 1996 ) and elmegreen & efremov ( 1997 ) suggest that a power - law mass spectrum with @xmath38 for the cluster gaseous progenitors is an imprint of the fractal structure of the star forming gas . as for the lower and upper limits of the cloud mass range , we adopt @xmath39 and @xmath40 , that is , the jeans mass range ( see section [ subsec : proto_gx ] ) . in the next section",
    ", we will explore how the mass function of the newly - born star clusters depends on these mass limits .",
    "star forming regions are characterized by a range in their respective star formation efficiency @xmath0 , so that the protoglobular cloud mass spectrum is convolved with an @xmath0 probability distribution function , which we describe by a decreasing power - law of slope @xmath7 and core @xmath41 , that is : @xmath42 the two parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 are determined so as to satisfy the two following constraints : ( 1 ) the integration of the probability distribution over the range @xmath45[0,1 ] is unity , and the probability @xmath46 is zero when @xmath47 .",
    "the formation of a bound star cluster requires its gaseous progenitor to achieve @xmath48 ( where `` th '' stands for `` threshold '' ) , i.e. , the _ local _ star formation efficiency must be greater than @xmath49 . on the scale of a galaxy ,",
    "star formation proceeds inefficiently , so the _ global _ star formation efficiency may be of order a few per cent only .",
    "the core @xmath41 and the slope @xmath7 of the efficiency distribution @xmath50 are thus bounded so that the mean star formation efficiency @xmath51 , namely , the mass fraction of gas converted into stars for an entire system of protoglobular clouds , is one per cent : @xmath52    for a given system of protoglobular clouds , the slope @xmath7 determines the fraction @xmath53 of clouds achieving a star formation efficiency larger than the threshold @xmath54 and , therefore , the initial size of the cluster system . combined with the @xmath27 vs. @xmath0 relation , it also determines the mean bound star formation efficiency @xmath55 , @xmath56 that is , the total mass fraction of gas converted into stars residing in bound systems after gas removal . to illustrate this with specific examples , table [ tab : sfe_dist ] lists the values of @xmath53 and @xmath55 for different triples ( @xmath7 , @xmath41 , @xmath54 ) ( see section [ subsubsec : sfeth ] for the case of non - explosive gas removal leading to @xmath54 significantly less than 0.33 ) .",
    "+    .fraction @xmath53 of protoglobular clouds giving rise to bound stellar clusters and mean bound star formation efficiency @xmath55 for various distributions @xmath46 and thresholds @xmath54 of the star formation efficiency , that is , for various triples ( @xmath7 , @xmath41 , @xmath54 ) . if @xmath57 , the core @xmath41 and the slope @xmath7 are bounded so that the mean star formation efficiency @xmath58 across the whole galaxy is 0.01 .",
    "the threshold @xmath54 depends on the gas removal timescale @xmath59 ( see section [ subsubsec : sfeth ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the present - day galaxy , the formation of unbound stellar groups is the rule and not the exception ( see section [ subsubsec : delta ] ) .",
    "most field stars in the galactic disc likely originate from embedded clusters which either lost a fraction of their original members or were disrupted while emerging out of their natal clouds .",
    "embedded clusters may therefore well be the fundamental units of star formation in the sense that they may account for the formation of the vast majority of all stars in the galaxy ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "it is likely that that paradigm also characterizes the formation of the stellar halo .",
    "actually , 98% of its mass consists of field stars and so large a mass fraction can not be accounted for by the secular evaporation and disruption of globular clusters over a hubble - time , regardless of the shape of the cluster initial mass function ( e.g. vesperini 1998 , baumgardt 1998 , parmentier & gilmore 2005 ) .",
    "for instance , tables [ tab : discretness_pl ] and [ tab : discretness_g ] demonstrate that the initial total mass in halo clusters is at most @xmath60 ( see the survival rate @xmath61 ) , which is an order of magnitude lower than the mass of the stellar halo .",
    "the present - day overwhelming fraction of field stars thus constitutes an `` _ ab initio _ '' feature of the galactic halo .",
    "it is worth noting that this may help understand why field stars and globular cluster stars sometimes show different patterns in their light element abundances . for instance , the group of o - poor and na - rich stars observed in some globular clusters is hardly detected in the field ( carretta , gratton & sneden 2000 ) .",
    "chemical abundance anomalies observed in globular cluster stars are usually ascribed to the accretion onto their surface of stellar winds of intermediate mass stars ascending the asymptotic giant branch , a process made feasible by the dense stellar environment characteristic of globular clusters . with the possible exception of binary systems , _ ab initio _ field stars remain unaffected by this external pollution , their external layers having never been exposed to any accretion process . if most present - day field stars have actually never belonged to bound globular clusters , then the absence of abundance anomalies characteristic of the asymptotic giant branch phase for these stars is not surprising .",
    "the violent relaxation phase affecting protoclusters following the expulsion of their residual star forming gas constitutes a prime candidate to explain the origin of field stars in the galactic halo , without conflicting with the well - accepted paradigm following which most stars form in clusters . in our fiducial cases , at an age of 13gyr , the total mass fraction of field stars @xmath62 in the halo arises from the three following contributions ( results for the power - law cloud mass spectrum and the gaussian cloud mass function are similar ) :    1 .   the disruption of protoclusters in the @xmath63 regime ( infant mortality ) : @xmath64 , 2 .   the loss of stars by protoclusters for which @xmath48 ( infant weight - loss ) : @xmath65 , 3 .   the evaporation and the disruption of globular clusters over a hubble - time ( adult mortality ) : @xmath66 .",
    "most halo field stars would thus be given off by star forming regions whose efficiency @xmath0 is less than the star formation efficiency threshold @xmath54 . in this respect ,",
    "the large value for @xmath67 directly results from the steep slope of @xmath68 , namely , @xmath69 ( combined with the assumption of instantaneous gas removal , that is , @xmath54 takes its highest possible value and , thus , strongly limits the number of clouds with @xmath48 ) .",
    "we caution however that this result is utterly model - dependent , having been derived under the assumption of a single functional form for the star formation efficiency distribution @xmath68 valid over the entire range @xmath70 , which may not be true .",
    "in this paper , we have presented simulations highlighting how the mass function of protoglobular clouds evolves into that of gas - free bound star clusters as a result of the expulsion of the residual star forming gas due to supernova activity .",
    "the initial mass of a star cluster depends on the mass fraction of its gaseous precursor which is turned into _ bound _ stars . to retain a bound core of stars ,",
    "a star forming region must achieve a star formation efficiency threshold @xmath54 of about 33% ( although this threshold gets lower if the gas is removed non - explosively , see section [ subsubsec : sfeth ] , and/or if the number of stars in the embedded cluster is a few thousands only ) . above this critical value ,",
    "the fraction @xmath27 of bound stars steadily increases from 0 ( when @xmath71 ) up to 1 ( when @xmath29 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fb_sfe ] ) .",
    "therefore , the initial mass of a star cluster does not depend on the star formation efficiency only .",
    "it is the bound star formation efficiency @xmath33 which is important ( equation [ eq : minit ] ) . by virtue of the large variations in @xmath33",
    "( i.e. between 0 and 1 ) , the cluster initial mass function does _ not _ necessarily mirror the cluster forming cloud mass function . in order to investigate this effect",
    ", we have convolved cloud mass spectra @xmath72 with star formation efficiency distributions @xmath68 , each value of the star formation efficiency @xmath0 being coupled to the corresponding fraction @xmath27 of stars remaining bound following gas removal .",
    "we have explicitely assumed that @xmath0 is independent of the cloud mass ( section [ subsec : pl_g ] ) .",
    "starting the simulations with power - law cloud mass spectra truncated at a lower - mass limit @xmath73 , we have shown that the resulting cluster initial mass functions are bell - shaped .",
    "since the gaseous precursors of old globular clusters ( i.e. those formed during the protogalactic era ) may actually be characterized by a lower mass limit ( section [ subsec : proto_gx ] ) , this result provides support to the early suggestion made by vesperini ( 1998 ) that the globular cluster initial mass function is a gaussian similar to that observed today ( i.e. an equilibrium cluster mass function , see section [ subsec : eqmf ] ) .",
    "that is , the present - day gaussian mass function is the preserved imprint of the cluster formation process rather than the imprint of cluster system dynamical evolution .",
    "consequently , our model also provides a new approach to investigate the origin of the universal location of the globular cluster mass function turnover .    in this respect , we have discussed how the cluster initial mass function responds to variations in the input parameters of our model ( see section [ subsec : to ] ) .",
    "we have successively varied the slope @xmath35 of the cloud mass spectrum , its lower and upper limits @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the slope @xmath7 and the scale - length @xmath41 of the star formation efficiency distribution @xmath68 , and the efficiency threshold @xmath54 required to retain a bound core of stars ( equivalently the gas removal time - scale @xmath59 measured in units of the protocluster crossing - time @xmath20 ) .",
    "we find that the turnover location is mostly sensitive to the lower limit @xmath73 of the protoglobular cloud mass spectrum .",
    "the observed universality of the turnover of the old globular cluster mass function would therefore originate from a common value among galaxies for the lower mass limit of protoglobular clouds , possibly with second - order variations driven by differences in the slopes of the cloud mass spectrum , that of the efficiency distribution @xmath68 , as well as by differences in the gas removal time - scale .",
    "combining our model generating cluster initial mass functions with the cluster evolutionary model of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) , we have subsequently investigated which input parameters reproduce both the present - day mass function of the old halo clusters and the present - day mass fraction in the stellar halo ( section [ subsec : isoqfgc_mlowmup ] ) . considering the case of a power - law mass spectrum for the protoglobular clouds with a spectral index @xmath1 ( as is often reported for the present - day giant molecular clouds and their cores ) and explosive gas removal ( i.e. the @xmath27 vs. @xmath0 relation considered is the solid curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : fb_sfe ] ) , we find a good fit for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . with respect to the cluster mass function",
    ", the most critical parameter is the cloud mass lower limit @xmath73 , since it sets the turnover location .",
    "the cloud mass upper limit @xmath74 affects the detailed shape of the mass function beyond the turnover without altering the location of the latter .",
    "variations in @xmath74 may thus explain why the high - mass regime of the cluster mass function differs among galaxies , even though the turnover remains unaffected ( see section [ subsec : mup ] ) .",
    "variations in the slope @xmath7 and core @xmath41 of the probability distribution @xmath68 of the star formation efficiency weakly influence the shape of the cluster mass function at an age of 13gyr ( see e.g. table [ tab : ohmf_var_pl ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ohmf ] ) .",
    "these parameters are mostly used to fix the global star formation efficiency @xmath58 ( i.e. the mass fraction of gas turned into stars at the scale of the protoglobular cloud system ) and the mean bound star formation efficiency @xmath75 ( i.e. , the mass fraction of gas ending up in clustered stars following gas removal ) ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : isoqfgc_mlowmup ] ) .",
    "specifically , for a given value of @xmath58 , the slope @xmath7 sets , in turn , the fraction of protoglobular clouds achieving @xmath48 , @xmath75 and the present - day mass fraction of clusters in the halo ( see equation [ eq : fgc2 ] ) .",
    "the total mass of the stellar halo is dominated by field stars and this overwhelming mass fraction ( 98% ) can not be accounted for by the secular dynamical evolution of globular clusters .",
    "the galactic stellar halo has thus been dominated by field stars since its earliest stages . in our model , this feature is accounted for by a steep value for the slope of @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "this results in the vast majority of the protoglobular clusters going into the infant mortality regime , that is , they are dislocated following gas removal and their stars are scattered into the field .    finally , we have also investigated whether a bell - shaped cluster initial mass function similar to that observed in old clusters today may arise from a characteristic cloud mass , the cluster mass spread resulting from the range in the bound star formation efficiency @xmath33 . actually , an ensemble of protoglobular clouds with a mass function centered around @xmath8 and a standard deviation @xmath9 reproduces the old halo cluster mass function , the turnover location being mostly driven by @xmath76 ( see section [ subsec : cloud_g ] ) .    in order to generate a gaussian globular cluster initial mass function similar to that today",
    ", our model thus requires a protoglobular cloud mass - scale of order @xmath77 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath78 1-decade cloud mass distribution ( truncated power - law or gaussian ) is of little relevance , as gas removal broadens it and turns it into a bell - shaped cluster initial mass function ( although the shape of the cloud mass distribution does influence the detailed shape of the cluster initial mass function ) .",
    "the observed location of the turnover at a cluster mass of @xmath79 stems from the @xmath77 mass - scale .",
    "therefore , the universality of the turnover of the globular cluster mass function would originate mostly from a common protoglobular cloud mass - scale among galaxies . that such a high mass - scale did actually exist remains debated ( section [ subsec : proto_gx ] ) .",
    "in contrast , present - day giant molecular clouds and their cores show no such cut - off at high mass .",
    "if their power - law mass spectrum is truncated at , say , @xmath80 , the turnover generated by our model gets located at similar a cluster mass and the inferred cluster initial mass spectrum is a power - law down to @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , with the mass - scale of the cluster gaseous progenitors as its key - parameter , our model can account for both the gaussian globular cluster initial mass function and the observed power - law mass spectrum of young massive star clusters formed in starbursts and mergers .",
    "we emphasize however that the gas - removal phase of our model does not include the impact of external effects , e.g. , the tidal field of the host galaxy .    while the mass function of globular clusters is a bell - shape , that of open clusters is a power - law ( van den bergh & lafontaine 1984 , battinelli , brandimarti , capuzzo - dolcetta 1994 ) . as for massive young clusters formed beyond the local group ,",
    "the difference may be driven by the presence or not of a lower mass limit for the cluster forming clouds / cores . additionally , we caution that the application of our model is necessarily restricted to the initial mass function of _ massive _ star clusters . actually , as for low - mass clusters ( e.g. open clusters ) , their relaxation time - scale is significantly shorter by virtue of their smaller number of stars . as a result ,",
    "the gravitational interactions between stars contribute to cluster dynamical evolution at an earlier time , while the exposed cluster is attempting to settle to a new state of equilibrium .",
    "this eases the formation of a bound core of stars , thereby altering the @xmath27 vs. @xmath0 relation with respect to what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fb_sfe ] . for instance , despite applying a tidal field and despite considering instantaneous gas removal , kroupa , aarseth & hurley ( 2001 ) find that a substantial bound core of stars @xmath82 remains even if @xmath0 is as low as @xmath83 .",
    "accounting for the variations in the bound fraction of stars as a function of the protocluster mass will eventually lead to a picture of the overall cluster mass function , from the low - mass regime ( @xmath84 - @xmath85 ) up to the high - mass one ( @xmath86-@xmath87 ) ( kroupa & boily 2002 ) .",

    "<S> evidence favouring a gaussian initial mass function for systems of old globular clusters has accumulated over recent years . </S>",
    "<S> we show that an approximately gaussian mass function is naturally generated from a power - law mass distribution of protoglobular clouds by expulsion from the protocluster of star forming gas due to supernova activity , provided that the power - law mass distribution shows a lower - mass limit . as a result of gas loss </S>",
    "<S> , the gravitational potential of the protocluster gets weaker and only a fraction of the newly formed stars is retained . </S>",
    "<S> the mass fraction of bound stars ranges from zero to unity , depending on the local star formation efficiency @xmath0 . assuming that @xmath0 is independent of the protoglobular cloud mass , we investigate how such variations affect the mapping of a protoglobular cloud mass function to the resulting globular cluster initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> a truncated power - law cloud mass spectrum generates bell - shaped cluster initial mass functions , with a turnover location mostly sensitive to the lower limit of the cloud mass range . assuming instantaneous gas removal and a slope @xmath1 for the cloud mass spectrum , we evolve the derived cluster initial mass functions up to an age of 13gyr in a potential like that of the milky way . we obtain a good match to the old halo cluster mass function , with a present - day mass mass fraction of clusters in the halo of @xmath2 , as is observed , with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively the lower and upper limits of the cloud mass range , the slope and the core of the power - law spectrum for the star formation efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the steep slope @xmath7 means that most protoglobular clouds achieve too low a star formation efficiency to give rise to bound star clusters following gas removal . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , most newly formed stars are scattered into the field soon after their formation . </S>",
    "<S> gas removal during star formation in massive clouds is thus likely the prime cause of the predominance of field stars in the galactic halo . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the present - day cluster mass function depends weakly on the underlying distribution of the star formation efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that a gaussian mass function for the protoglobular clouds with a mean @xmath8 and a standard deviation @xmath9 provides results very similar to those resulting from a truncated power - law cloud mass spectrum , that is , the distribution function of masses of protoglobular clouds influences only weakly the shape of the resulting globular star cluster initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> the gas removal process and the protoglobular cloud mass - scale dominate the relevant physics .    </S>",
