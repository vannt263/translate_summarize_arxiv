    "surely , we can define locally minimal embedding analogously .",

    "we remark that this approach to estimate the genus range can be optimized in the similar manner as in corollary  [ 4cor22 ] , i.e. , the minimum ( resp .",
    "maximum ) can take over all @xmath3-facial disjoint covers , where a @xmath3-facial disjoint cover is a set of mutually @xmath3-facial disjoint vertices such that the union of their incident faces is the set of all faces of @xmath3 .",
    "additionally , it may be possible to obtain a more efficient procedure to determine @xmath332 $ ] if we combine our approach here and other algorithms to generate an embedding ( if there is ) of @xmath1 on a given surface of genus @xmath2 , e.g. , the linear algorithm in  @xcite . a rough idea could be as follows : suppose we know that @xmath333 .",
