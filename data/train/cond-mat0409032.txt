    "the inelastic scattering processes occurring in mesoscopic samples as a consequence of a finite non - zero temperature can noticeably change the coherent transport fingerprints of these structures .",
    "the worsening of electronic transmission due to such effects is expected but in some situations the competition between the phase - breaking mechanisms and the quantum coherent interferences can improve conductance in certain energetic regimes .",
    "this is the case , for example , of disordered structures .",
    "this fact has attracted much attention in the study and modelling of dissipative transport in one - dimensional structures .",
    "interest is also prompted by experiments currently being carried out on real atomic chains @xcite .",
    "a model of parametrized scatterers coupled through additional side channels to electron reservoirs incorporating inelastic events was initially proposed by bttiker @xcite , and much work has been done along this line @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", inelastic processes can be modelled by small absorptions which in turn can be described by extending the nature of the quantum potentials to the complex domain .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to include absorptive processes by performing these complex extensions on previous quantum wire models developed by the authors @xcite and also on other atomic potentials .",
    "the use of complex site energies and frequencies has already been considered in the study of electronic conductivity through one - dimensional chains @xcite , but non - hermitian hamiltonians have also been used to account for a large variety of phenomena , ranging from wave transport in absorbing media @xcite , violation of the single parameter scaling in one - dimensional absorbing systems @xcite , appearance of exceptional points in scattering theory @xcite and quantum chaology @xcite , description of vortex delocalization in superconductors with a transverse meissner effect @xcite and more phenomenologically with nuclear optical potentials .",
    "special mention is required for the framework of @xmath0-symmetry @xcite , where it is possible to consider periodic wires under complex potentials showing real band spectra @xcite .",
    "there is nothing wrong in principle with the use of non - hermitian hamiltonians as long as their properties are controlled by a sufficient knowledge of the full spectrum .",
    "indeed , renormalization group calculations have been carried out giving rise to imaginary couplings as a result of quantum dressing of the classical real potentials @xcite .    an interesting modern review on absorption in quantum mechanics",
    "has appeared recently @xcite and we address the interested reader to this publication and references therein .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mct ] we briefly review the multiple collision technique based on the transfer matrix method , and in section [ sec : schro ] we show how unitarity can be easily restored in the presence of absorption and how the general unitarity condition can be generalized accordingly .",
    "we then turn our attention to arrays of delta potentials and calculate and draw the scattering and absorption probabilities in section [ sec : deltas ] . in section [ sec : posch ] , the pschl - teller potential is used to build atomic chains , and its complex extension the complex scarf potential is fully developed in section [ sec : scarf ] .",
    "the analytical scattering probabilities are shown for a variety of composite potential profiles and the effect of the imaginary parts on the transmission is analyzed .",
    "the calculations concerning exact wave functions and analytical conditions are offered in two appendices .",
    "the paper ends with several concluding remarks .",
    "the time - independent scattering process in one dimension can be described using the well known continuous transfer matrix method @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2@xmath3 mean the amplitudes of the asymptotic travelling plane waves @xmath4 at the left ( right ) side of the potential .",
    "whatever the nature of the potential is , real or complex , the transmission matrix always verifies @xmath5 as a consequence of the constant wronskian of the solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the transmission and reflection amplitudes then read , @xmath6 where the superscripts @xmath7 stand for left and right incidence .",
    "the insensitivity of the transmission amplitude to the incidence direction is a universal property that holds for all kind of potentials .",
    "however , the reflectivity , although symmetric for real potentials , changes with the incidence side for a complex one unless it is symmetric @xcite .",
    "the effect of a composition of @xmath8 different potentials can then be considered as the product of their transmission matrices , @xmath9 the transmission matrix formalism is an important tool for the numerical treatment of different problems .",
    "an intuitive and general interpretation of the composition procedure can be given in the following form .",
    "consider two potentials @xmath10 characterized by the scattering amplitudes @xmath11 and joined at a certain point .",
    "then , the scattering amplitudes of the composite potential can be obtained by considering the coherence sum of all the multiple reflection processes that might occur at the connection region ,    [ eq : comp ] @xmath12    replacing the scattering amplitudes with the elements of the corresponding transmission matrices @xmath13 , one can trivially check that in fact these last formulae are the equations of the product @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the composition rules given by are not restricted to the convergence interval of the series @xmath15 .",
    "they provide an explicit relation of the global scattering amplitudes in terms of the individual former ones and can be easily used recurrently for numerical purposes .",
    "this composition technique was first derived for a potential barrier @xcite and has been used for designing absorbing potentials @xcite .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional complex potential of finite support @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "for the stationary scattering states , the density of the current flux is proportional to the imaginary part of the potential @xmath18 where @xmath19 is defined as , @xmath20 therefore , in the presence of a non - vanishing @xmath21 the unitarity relation regarding the transmission and reflection probabilities @xmath22 is no longer valid .",
    "one can still recover a pseudounitarity relation by defining a quantity that accounts for the loss of flux in the scattering process .",
    "dealing with the asymptotic state @xmath23 , @xmath24 , one can write the asymptotic values of the flux as , @xmath25 yielding the relation , @xmath26 this latter equation remains the same for the right incidence case ( with @xmath27 ) when the asymptotic state takes the form @xmath28 , @xmath29 .    using eq . the flux term reads , @xmath30 and it is usually understood as the probability of absorption @xcite .",
    "but @xmath31 must be a positive defined quantity in order to be strictly considered as a probability and this is not ensured by the definition ( unless @xmath32 ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath31 depends on both the changes in sign of the imaginary part of the potential and the spatial distribution of the state .",
    "although a negative value for @xmath31 could be viewed as emission ( because it means a gain in the flux current ) it also leads the transmitivity and the reflectivity to attain anomalous values @xmath33 , which are difficult to interpret .",
    "let us also note that the integral representation of the absorption term is useless for practical purposes because to build the correct expression of the state @xmath34 one needs to impose the given asymptotic forms to the general solution of the schrdinger equation , therefore obtaining the scattering amplitudes , so one can not calculate the absorption probability without knowing @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "let us consider a potential constituted by a finite array of dirac delta distributions , each one with its own coupling @xmath37 and equally spaced at a distance @xmath38 .",
    "this is probably the simplest one - dimensional model imaginable , but in spite of its apparently simplicity it supports an unexpected physical richness .",
    "it has been successfully used to model band structure in a periodic quantum wire @xcite and has proved its usefulness when considering uncorrelated and correlated disorder structures @xcite , showing interesting effects such as the fractality of the density of states and the different localization regimes for the electronic states .",
    "the global potential will be characterized by the arranged sequence of the parameters @xmath39 , where @xmath40 means the `` effective range '' of the @xmath41th delta , in the order they appear from left to right .",
    "the transmission matrix for a delta potential preceded by a zero potential zone of length @xmath38 reads , @xmath42 considering a chain of @xmath43 different deltas and applying the composition rules to this type of matrices one finds that it is possible to write a closed expression for the scattering amplitudes .",
    "they are given by ,    [ eq : tyr ] @xmath44    with the definitions    [ eq : fool ] @xmath45\\right\\ } \\\\",

    "the @xmath52 amplitude up to a phase is obtained from @xmath53 for the reverse chain .",
    "these latter formulae resemble the equations for the band structure and eigenenergies of the closed system @xcite . in spite of their formidable aspect , eqs .",
    "are easy to program for sequential calculations , providing the transmitivity and reflectivity of the system with exact analytical expressions .",
    "let us now incorporate the dissipative processes that are always present in real wires , causing energy losses .",
    "we have modelled that effect by including an imaginary part in the potential . in this case",
    "the natural complex extension of our system consists in promoting the delta couplings from real to complex , thus writing @xmath54 .",
    "we also take @xmath55 for all @xmath46 in order to avoid anomalous scattering . the effect of including",
    "complex couplings on the spectrum of an infinite periodic delta chain has recently been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "let us see what happens in a chain with open boundaries . in fig.[fig : delper ] the usual scattering diagram is shown for a short periodic chain with real potentials . including a small imaginary part in the couplings we see how the transmission pattern is altered with a non - negligible absorption that peaks at the incoming band edges while the reflectivity is not noticeably changed .",
    "this tendency of the absorption term also appears when several species are included in the periodic array , and its pattern does not change much if only some of the couplings are complexified .",
    "when the array presents no ordering at all , the graph is quite unpredictable and different configurations can be obtained . in fig.[fig : delran](a ) a peaky spectrum with very sharp absorption resonances is shown .",
    "the scattering process in this case is strongly dependent on the direction incidence , as can be seen . on the other hand ,",
    "smoother diagrams are also possible in which the effect of the complex potential manifests through an almost constant absorption background and a small change depending upon the colliding side , like the one in fig.[fig : delran](b ) .",
    "this naive potential , apart from being exactly solvable , is powerful enough to account for very different physical schemes , which makes it a very useful bench - proof structure .",
    "let us go one step further and consider a potential that resembles the profile of an atomic quantum well with analytical solutions , the well - known pschl - teller potential hole .",
    "it reads , @xmath56 and it is shown in fig.[fig : poteler ] .",
    "the probability of asymptotic transmission is well known@xcite , @xmath57 one characteristic feature of the pschl - teller hole is that it behaves as an absolute transparent potential for integer values of @xmath58 , as can be seen from eq .. from the wave functions one can also obtain the asymptotic transmission matrix , @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "let us try to build a chain with these atomic units .",
    "in order to do so , one has to include a sensible cut - off in the potentials to ensure first that the wave function takes a proper form at the junction regions and second that the resulting potential hole can still be described by a handy transmission matrix , so that eqs . can be applied easily",
    ". the cut - off will be placed at a distance @xmath61 from the center of the potential ( fig.[fig : poteler ] ) .",
    "the wave function in the interval @xmath62 $ ] is @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the even and odd solutions respectively of the schrdinger equation . outside that interval the wave function",
    "is assumed to be a superposition of the free particle solutions , regions 1 and 3 in fig.[fig : poteler ] .",
    "the connection equations at the cut - off points lead to a relationship between the amplitudes of the wave function in sectors 1 and 3 in terms of the values of @xmath65 and their spatial derivatives at @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the distance @xmath61 must be such that the asymptotic form of the solutions of the schrdinger equation can be used at that point in order to ensure a sensible transition to the free particle state and to obtain a transmission matrix as simple as possible .",
    "the solutions @xmath64 as well as their asymptotic forms are found in reference ; nevertheless they are also reproduced in appendix [ ap : apenpoteler ] .    after some algebra one finds the transmission matrix for the cut - off version of the potential hole ,",
    "@xmath67 the matrix is the same as for the asymptotic case in eq . plus",
    "an extra phase term in the diagonal elements that accounts for the distance @xmath68 during which the particle feels the effect of the potential .",
    "these phases are the key quantities for the composition procedure since they will be responsible for the interference processes that produce the transmission patterns . due to the rapid decay of the pschl - teller potential ,",
    "the distance @xmath61 admits very reasonable values .",
    "in fact , we have seen that for a sensibly wide range of the parameters @xmath69 $ ] , @xmath70 $ ] one can take as a minimum value for the cut - off distance @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the half - width ( fig.[fig : poteler ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath73 the connection procedure works really well , as we have checked in all cases by comparing the analytical composition technique versus a high precision numerical integration of the schrdinger equation , obtaining an excellent degree of agreement .",
    "composing two potential holes and applying eqs . together with eq .",
    "one finds for the transmission probability , using the previously defined quantities @xmath74,@xmath75    @xmath76    which is a handy expression that can hardly be obtained by trying to solve the schrdinger equation for the double potential hole . to our knowledge",
    "this calculation has not been made before .",
    ". clearly shows the interference effect depending on the distance @xmath77 between the centers of the holes .",
    "an example of transmission is shown in fig.[fig : postel1 ] .",
    "the composition procedure can be applied with a small number of atoms to study the transmitivity of different potential profiles resembling molecular structures such as those in fig.[fig : molecules ] .",
    "the transmission matrix can also be used to consider a continuous disordered model in the form of a large chain of these potential holes with random parameters .",
    "so far , in the literature only two kinds of potentials have been used to build continuous disordered models , namely the dirac delta potential and the square well(barrier ) , due to their well known and easy to manipulate transmission matrices .",
    "we recall the fact that handy transmission matrices can be obtained for other potential profiles using reasonable approximations , such as the one described here .",
    "the next step for our purpose is to consider dissipation in these one - dimensional composite potentials .",
    "we shall consider the extension of the pschl - teller potential given by the complexified scarf potential , @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "it is a proper complex extension for two reasons : it admits analytical solutions @xcite and its imaginary part is somehow proportional to the derivative of the real potential .",
    "this latter criterion has been considered in nuclear optical potentials to choose adequate complex extensions .",
    "it seems reasonable to measure the strength of the dissipation processes in terms of the `` density '' of the real interaction and therefore writing an imaginary potential that is proportional to the spatial derivative of the real one .",
    "the potential profile is shown in fig.[fig : potscarf ] .",
    "the scarf potential has been extensively considered in the literature , mainly dealing with its discrete spectrum , either in its real and complex forms , from the point of view of susy quantum mechanics @xcite or focusing on its @xmath0-symmetric form @xcite .",
    "first , a detailed mathematical analysis of the potential , regarding its scattering properties , must be made to discuss some new features and some assertions that have been made .",
    "the left scattering amplitudes of the real scarf potential have been obtained in terms of complex gamma functions @xcite .",
    "recently , a considerable simplification has been pointed out by ahmed@xcite .",
    "in fact , the asymptotic transmitivity and reflectivity for the complex scarf can be written as ,    @xmath80    where @xmath81 and @xmath27 is recovered from @xmath82 by interchanging @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( which is equivalent to substituting @xmath85 and therefore changing the direction of incidence ) .",
    "these expressions derive from the asymptotic transmission matrix , which is obtained here using the asymptotic form of the schrdinger equation solutions ( appendix [ ap : scarf ] ) , @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 with the definitions @xmath89 it immediately follows from the transmission matrix that the absorption probabilities read , @xmath90    unlike the complex delta potentials example this potential has some drawbacks that must be carefully solved .",
    "its imaginary part is non - negative defined in its domain , which might cause anomalous scattering .",
    "only some values of @xmath91 will be physically acceptable . to ensure that @xmath92 , it is clear from eq . that the necessary and sufficient condition is @xmath93 .",
    "the functions @xmath83 , @xmath84 can be real or pure imaginary depending on the values of @xmath94 and @xmath91 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the conditions for physical transmission is presented in appendix [ ap : scarf ] . as a summary ,",
    "let us say that for @xmath95 ( barriers ) , the evaluation of the condition translates into , @xmath96\\cup\\\\ & [ 2n(2n-1)+v_1,2n(2n+1)+v_1 ]      \\quad n\\in\\mathbb{z}^+ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] for @xmath97 ( wells ) the situation becomes more complicated and the result can only be expressed through several inequalities , each one adding a certain allowed range for @xmath91 ( see appendix [ ap : scarf ] ) . as an example , in table [ tab : v2 ] we show the compatible ranges of @xmath91 for a few negative values of @xmath94 .",
    "one can trivially check the compatibility of the intervals presented for @xmath91 with the condition @xmath98 by plotting eq .. in a two dimensional plot of @xmath99 vs. @xmath94 , the physical ranges for the transmission distribute as alternating fringes and a funny chessboard like pattern ( fig.[fig : chess ] ) .",
    ".ranges of @xmath91 compatible with the condition @xmath100 for the complex scarf potential for certain negative values of @xmath94 .",
    "the last column includes the intervals providing physical scattering from the emissive side of the potential . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the absorption obviously vanishes for all @xmath101 when considering these special resonant values of the potential amplitudes .",
    "surprisingly , there also exists another set of non - trivial correlated values of @xmath102 for which the potential is non - dissipative ( @xmath103 ) without being fully transparent .",
    "this set of values satisfies @xmath104 , as can be seen from eqs .. non - trivial solutions exist when @xmath105 , yielding , @xmath106 let us also notice from eqs . that these solutions are also the borders where the physical scattering changes from the absorptive side to the emissive side or vice versa .",
    "we shall refer to these borders as inversion points ( ip ) .",
    "therefore , whenever we encounter an ip we can say @xmath103 without a fully transparent behaviour , and hence a non - dissipative scattering process for all energies with a non - vanishing imaginary part of the potential .",
    "let us note that from eq .",
    "the ip only appears in the case of scarf potential wells and only for @xmath107 . in fig.[fig : plains ] the characteristic scattering probabilities are shown for a scarf barrier and a scarf well , and in fig.[fig : camel ] the maximum value of the physical absorption is plotted versus @xmath99 for different values of @xmath94 .",
    "when @xmath94 is positive the absorption grows with the amplitude of the imaginary part of the potential . on the other hand , for negative @xmath94 a strikingly different pattern arises , with transparencies ( t ) and inversion points ( ip ) and the absorption does not increase monotonically with @xmath99 .",
    "the whole behaviour of the scattering can be clearly understood by building a two dimensional diagram @xmath99 vs. @xmath94 ( fig.[fig : chess ] ) , including physically permitted ranges , inversion lines and the points of transmission resonance .",
    "the complex scarf potential shows two opposite faces to scattering , namely barrier and well , and a much richer structure in the latter case .",
    "after this detailed analysis of the peculiarities of the complex scarf , that to our knowledge have not been reported before , let us continue with our work on connecting several potentials to model dissipative atomic chains .",
    "the procedure is the same as the one described for the pschl - teller potential hole in section [ sec : posch ] .",
    "only the portion of the potential included in the interval @xmath62 $ ] is taken ( fig.[fig : potscarf ] ) . making use of the asymptotic forms of the wave functions , and after some algebra",
    ", one finds the transmission matrix for the complex scarf potential with a symmetrical cut - off , @xmath108 the matrix proves to be the same as for the asymptotic case ( eq . ) , but with the extra phase @xmath109 in the diagonal terms .",
    "it can be checked that the half - widths @xmath72 of both the real and imaginary parts coincide and that the decay of the imaginary part of the potential is always slower than that of the real part ( fig.[fig : potscarf ] ) .",
    "this causes an increase in the minimum value of the cut - off distance @xmath110 with regard to the pschl - teller case . for sensible values of the potential amplitudes",
    "we have found that considering @xmath111 is enough in most cases .",
    "in fact , this minimum value can be relaxed in the case of potential barriers ( @xmath95 ) , whereas for potential wells taking @xmath61 below this value to apply the connection equations may sometimes distort the results .",
    "the correct behaviour of the connection procedure for @xmath73 can be observed in fig.[fig : transition ] where the scattering probabilities obtained upon integrating the schrdinger equation numerically are compared with those given by the analytical composition technique , for two potential barriers and two potential wells with different choices of the cut - off distance and with high values for @xmath99 . notice how in the barrier example convergence between the methods is completely reached for @xmath112 whereas for potential wells a further step is needed because the convergence is much slower .",
    "once the connection of potentials has been successfully made , one should ask which are the ranges of the potential amplitudes that provide an acceptable physical scattering in this new framework .",
    "analysis of this issue is very non - trivial and quite complex analytically , but also very important because it determines whether this model remains useful when considering atomic chains .",
    "first , in the case of two potentials we have observed that choosing each individual pair of amplitudes @xmath113 belonging to a physical range , and selecting the signs of the imaginary parts so that the physical faces of both potentials point in the same direction , then an acceptable scattering for the composite potential can always be recovered at least from one of the two possible orientations ( both physical faces to the right or to the left ) .",
    "in other words , considering that the incident particle always collides with the left side ( it comes from @xmath114 ) and therefore orientating the individual physical faces to the left , then at least one of the sequences @xmath115 or @xmath116 gives an acceptable scattering for all energies .",
    "we have checked this assertion for a broad variety of scarf couples . for a higher number of potentials",
    "the situation becomes more complex but a few pseudo - rules to obtain physical scattering can be deduced . for an arbitrary chain we have found that in many cases the left scattering remains physical as long as : the left scattering of each individual potential is physical and the left scattering of each couple of contiguous potentials is physical .",
    "this recipe seems completely true when composing potential barriers only , whereas when wells are included it fails in some situations , especially when several contiguous wells are surrounded by barriers .",
    "although at the beginning it may appear almost random to recover a physical scattering from a large composition of scarfs , following the given advices it turns out to be more systematic .",
    "let us remember that the composition procedure , apart from being a powerful tool for numerical calculations also provides analytical expressions for the scattering probabilities , which of course adopt cumbersome forms for a large number of potentials but are useful for obtaining simple expansions for certain energetic regimes . just as an example , the transmitivity and left reflectivity for the double scarf read ,    @xmath117    making use of the previously defined terms @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "one important feature of the formulae for the composite scattering probabilities is the fact that they analytically account for the fully transparent behaviour of the whole structure as long as there is resonant forward scattering of the individual potential units , as can be seen from the latter equations and also from eq . for the double pschl - teller .",
    "another curious feature arises when composing different potentials whose amplitudes describe an ip . in this case",
    "the whole structure remains non - dissipative ( fig.[fig : ips ] ) .",
    "moreover , the complex scarfs at these points behave completely as real potentials , providing an acceptable scattering for the composition that is independent of the incidence direction for any sequence of the individual scarfs .",
    "considering larger scarf chains with small imaginary parts of the potentials , in the case of a periodic array we observe that the absorption term remains flat over a wide range of forbidden bands and oscillates inside the permitted ones .",
    "the variations in the absorption are entirely balanced by the reflectivity while the transmitivity is surprisingly not affected by the presence of a small complex potential ( fig.[fig : blochscarf ] ) .",
    "this behaviour contrasts strongly with the complex delta potentials periodic chain where the absorption was completely different and it was the reflectivity that was little affected by the dissipation .    for an aperiodic sequence",
    "the situation is quite different , as expected . in fig.[fig : scarmole ] a type of molecular aggregate is modelled with complex scarfs .",
    "it exhibits a peaky absorption spectrum and a strongly oscillating transmitivity with sharp resonances . in fig.[fig : scaraggre ] a symmetric atomic cluster has been considered in which the dissipation only occurs at both ends .",
    "different transmission and absorption configurations can be obtained by building different structures .",
    "this shows the usefulness and versatility of this model for being able to account for a variety of possible experimental observations .    as a final exercise",
    ", two examples are included in fig.[fig : damping ] showing the evolution of the transmitivity of two different scarf compositions as a function of the imaginary part of the potential .",
    "the transmission patterns are plotted for different values of the parameter @xmath120 , which measures the strength of the imaginary part .",
    "the transmission efficiency is evaluated using an averaged transmitivity @xmath121 corresponding to the area enclosed by @xmath36 per energy unit in a characteristic energy range , namely the zone where @xmath122 evolves until it becomes saturated .",
    "the imaginary potential tends to smooth the transmission pattern in the first example ( corresponding to a sequence of barriers ) , causing a slight decrease in the averaged transmitivity for low @xmath123 , although it is finally improved . for a double well",
    "a different effect occurs .",
    "@xmath124 is always enhanced with increasing @xmath123 until it reaches a maximum , after which the transmitivity falls with the imaginary potential . with these results in mind",
    "one could speculate that these models might also be useful to describe the phase - breaking inelastic scattering processes in atomic chains .",
    "especially when one treats disordered arrays where the break of the localization regime could arise as a result of the loss of coherence due to inelastic collisions .",
    "in this work we have used the transfer matrix formalism in the form of the multiple collision technique to model dissipative scattering processes by using complex potentials in various models of atomic chains .",
    "the absorption probability has been rigorously included to recover unitarity for the non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "new exact analytical expressions are given for the scattering amplitudes of an arbitrary chain of delta potentials .",
    "the absorption effects arising by promoting the delta couplings to the complex domain have been shown , revealing the flexibility of this simple model to account for very different physical schemes .",
    "handy expressions for the transmission matrices of the pschl - teller and the complex scarf potential have been constructed in their asymptotic as well as their cut - off versions for the first time .",
    "these latter matrices have made feasible , via the composition technique , the assembly of an arbitrary number of potentials to build atomic one - dimensional wires that can incorporate absorptive processes .",
    "different absorption configurations are presented in several examples that show the versatility of the model to account for a variety of possible experimental observations .",
    "the procedure developed is not only useful for numerical calculations but also provides analytical formulae for the composite scattering probabilities , which have not been obtained by other methods , and whose significance has been checked by numerical integrations of the schrdinger equation .    from a more mathematical view ,",
    "a complete and rigorous analysis of the scattering properties of the complex scarf potential has been carried out .",
    "the ranges of physical transmission have been obtained and a group of novel features have arisen such as the presence of perfect transparencies and inversion points .    apart from being able to include dissipation in the systems in a tractable way , the tools and methods provided may have direct applicability for considering molecular aggregates @xcite and other structures with explicit potential profiles and also to build a new kind of continuous disordered models .    future work seems promising since we are already in progress on the assembly of the one - dimensional structures to quantum dots in order to analyze the effect of dissipation on the conductance .",
    "our aim is also to treat long disordered wires within this framework , and in particular to study the applicability of these potentials to account for the loss of coherence due to inelastic scattering process in the electronic localization regime .",
