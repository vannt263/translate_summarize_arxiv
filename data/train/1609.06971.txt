    "this paper investigates the behaviour of the liouville function which is connected to riemann s zeta function , @xmath3 , defined by@xmath8    where @xmath9 is a positive integer and @xmath2 is a complex variable , with the series being convergent for @xmath10 .",
    "this function has zeros ( referred to as the trivial zeros ) at the negative even integers @xmath11riemann s hypothesis claims that the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function all occur on the critical line which occurs at @xmath12 it has been shown that there are an infinite number of zeros on the critical line .",
    "the claim that these are the only nontrivial zeros has eluded proof to date , and this paper demonstrates that the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) is resolvable by tackling the liouville function s dirichlet series generated by @xmath13 , which is readily rendered in the form@xmath14    where @xmath15 is the liouville function defined by @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being the total number of prime numbers in the factorization of @xmath9 , including the multiplicity of the primes .",
    "we would also need the summatory function @xmath18 , which is defined as the partial sum upto @xmath19 terms of the following series : @xmath20    since the function @xmath4 will exhibit poles at the zeros of @xmath21 , we seek to identify where @xmath3 can have zeros by examining the region over which @xmath4 is analytic . by demonstrating that a sufficient condition , derived by littlewood ( 1912 ) , for the rh to be true is indeed satisfied ,",
    "we show that all the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function occur on the critical line @xmath7 .    briefly , our method consists in judiciously partitioning the set of positive integers into sets of sub - series and couching the infinite sum in ( 2 ) into an infinite number of sums over these sub - series , with each such series being uniformly convergent .",
    "this method of considering a slowly converging series as a sum of many sub - series was used by the author in problems where neumann series were involved.(eswaran ( 1990 ) ) .    in this paper",
    "we were able to break up the sum of the liouville function into sums over many sub - series whose behaviour is predictable .",
    "it so turns out that one prime number @xmath22 ( and its powers ) which is associated with a particular sub - series controls the behaviour of the sub series .",
    "each sub - series is in the form of rectangular functions ( waves ) of unit amplitude but ever increasing periodicity and widths -we call these as ` harmonics ' , so every prime number is thus associated with such harmonic rectangular functions which then play a role in contributing to the value of @xmath18 .",
    "it so turns out that if n goes from n to n+1 , the new value of @xmath23 solely depends upon the factorization of n+1 , and the particular harmonic that contributes to the change in @xmath18 is completely determined by this factorization . since factorizations of numbers involve primes which are uncorrelated , we are to deduce that the statistical distribution of @xmath18 when n is large is like that of the cumulative sum of n coin tosses , ( a head contributing + 1 and a tail contributing -1 ) , and thus logically lead to the final conclusion of this paper .",
    "we found a new method of factorizing every integer and placing it in an exclusive subset , where it and its other members form an increasing sequence which in turn factorize alternately into odd and even factors ; this method exploited the inherent symmetries of the problem and was very useful in the present context .",
    "once this symmetry was recognized , we saw that it was natural to invoke it in the manner in which the sum in ( 2 ) was performed .",
    "we may view the sum as one over subsets of series that exhibit convergence even outside the domain of the half - plane @xmath10 .",
    "we were rewarded , for following the procedure pursued in this paper , with the revelation that the liouville function ( and therefore the zeta function ) is controlled by innumerable rectangular harmonic functions , whose form and content are now precisely known and each of which is associated with a prime number and all prime numbers play their due role . and in fact all harmonic functions associated with prime numbers below or equal to a particular value n determine the present value of l(n ) .    when we are oblivious to the underlying symmetry being alluded to here , we render the summation in ( 2 ) less tractable than necessary .",
    "this is precisely what happens when we perform the summation in the usual manner , setting @xmath24 in sequence .",
    "the liouville function @xmath15 is defined over the set of positive integers @xmath9 as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of prime factors of @xmath9 , multiplicities included and by definition @xmath27 . thus @xmath28 when @xmath9 has an even number of prime factors and @xmath29 when it has odd .",
    "it is a completely arithmetical function obeying @xmath30 for any two positive integers @xmath31 .",
    "we shall consider subsets of positive integers such as @xmath32 arranged in increasing order and are such that their values of @xmath33 alternate in sign : @xmath34    it turns out that we can label such subsets with a triad of integers , which we now proceed to do .",
    "to construct such a labeling scheme , consider an example of an integer @xmath9 that can be uniquely factorized into primes as follows:@xmath35    where @xmath36 are prime numbers and the @xmath37 are the integer exponents of the respective primes , and @xmath38 is the largest prime with exponent exceeding @xmath39 .",
    "integers of this sort , with at least one multiple prime factor are referred to here as class i integers . in contrast",
    ", we shall refer to integers with no multiple prime factors as class ii integers .",
    "a typical integer , @xmath40 , of class ii may be written@xmath41    where , once again , the prime factors are written in increasing order .",
    "we now show how we construct a labelling scheme for integer sets that exhibit the property in ( 2.3 ) of alternating signs in their corresponding @xmath42 s .",
    "first consider class i integers .",
    "with reference to ( 2.4 ) , we define integers @xmath43 as follows:@xmath44    in ( 2.6 ) , @xmath45 is the product of all primes less than @xmath38 , @xmath22 is the largest multiple prime in the factorization , and @xmath46 is the product of all prime number larger than @xmath38 in the factorization .",
    "thus the class i integer @xmath9 can be written@xmath47hence we will label this integer @xmath9 as @xmath48,using the triad of numbers@xmath49 and the exponent @xmath50 .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath46 will consist of prime factors all larger than @xmath22 and @xmath46 can not be divided by the square of a prime number .",
    "consider the infinite set of integers , @xmath51 , defined by@xmath52    the class i integer @xmath9 necessarily belongs to the above set because @xmath53 . since the consecutive integer members of this set have been obtained by multiplying by @xmath22 , thereby increasing the number of primes by one , this set satisfies property ( 3 ) of alternating signs of the corresponding @xmath33 s .",
    "note that the lowest integer of this set @xmath54 of class i integers is @xmath55 .",
    "we may similarly form a series for class ii integers .",
    "the integer @xmath40 in ( 5 ) may be written @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "this class ii integer is put into the set @xmath51 defined by@xmath60    the set containing class ii integers is distinguished by the facts that @xmath59 for all of them , their largest prime factor is always @xmath22 and none of them can be divided by the square of a prime number @xmath61 , s.t .",
    "@xmath62 , in other words the factor @xmath45 can not be divided by the square of a prime . in this",
    "set , too , the @xmath33 s alternate in sign as we move through it and so property ( 2.3 ) is satisfied .",
    "again , note that the lowest integer of this set @xmath63 is class ii integer : @xmath64 , all the others are class i.    in what follows , we shall find it handy to refer to the set of ascending integers comprising @xmath51 as a ` tower ' .",
    "it is important to distinguish between a tower ( or set ) described by a triad like @xmath49 and an integer belonging to that set .",
    "the set or tower of class i integers described by the label @xmath49 is the infinite series @xmath65 , the first element of which is @xmath55 and all other members of which are @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .",
    "a set or tower containing a class ii integer described by @xmath68 is the infinite sequence @xmath69 , eq.(2.9),of which only the first element @xmath64 is a class ii integer and all other members , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , are class i , because the latter have exponents greater than 1 . for convenient reference",
    ", we shall refer to the first member of a tower as the base integer or the base of the tower .",
    "it is also worth noting that when we refer to a triad like @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , we are invariably referring to the integer @xmath66 and not to any set or tower .",
    "labels for sets do not contain exponents ; only those for integers do .",
    "of course , the particular integer @xmath74 belongs to set or tower @xmath49    two simple examples illustrate the construction of the sets denoted by @xmath54 :    ex . 1 : the integer @xmath75 , which factorizes as @xmath76 , is clearly a class i integer since it is divisible by the square of a prime number  in fact there are two such numbers , @xmath77 and @xmath78but we identify @xmath22 with @xmath78 as it is the larger prime .",
    "it is a member of the set @xmath79 .",
    "2 : the integer @xmath80 , which factorizes as @xmath81 , is a class ii integer because it is not divisible by the square of a prime number .",
    "it belongs to the set @xmath82 .",
    "note that two different integers can not share the same triad .",
    "is the product @xmath83 , which obviously can not take on two distinct values . ] and two different triads can not represent the same integer . and",
    "@xmath84 represent the same integer , say @xmath9",
    ". then we must have @xmath85it follows that at least two numbers of the tetrad @xmath86 must differ from their counterparts in the tetrad @xmath87 .",
    "since the factorization of @xmath9 is unique , this is impossible . ]",
    "thus the mapping from a triad to an integer is one - one and onto .",
    "a formal proof is in the appendix .",
    "the following properties of the sets @xmath51 may be noted :    \\(a ) the factorization of an integer @xmath9 immediately determines whether it is a class i or a class ii type of integer .",
    "\\(b ) the factorization of integer @xmath9 also identifies the set @xmath51 to which @xmath9 is assigned .",
    "\\(c ) the procedure defines all the other integers that belong to the same set as a given integer .",
    "\\(d ) every integer belongs to some set @xmath51 ( allowing for the possibility that @xmath59 )  and only to one set .",
    "this ensures that , collectively , the infinite number of sets of the form @xmath51 exactly reproduce the set of positive integers @xmath88 , without omissions or duplications .    our procedure , taking its cue from the deep connection between the zeta function and prime numbers , has constructed a labeling scheme that relies on the unique factorisation of integers into primes . in what follows",
    ", we shall recast the summation in ( 2 ) into one over the sets @xmath51 .",
    "the advantage of breaking up the infinite sum over all positive integers into partial sums over the @xmath51 sets will soon become clear .",
    "we shall now implement the above partitioning of the set of all positive integers to examine the analytic properties of @xmath4 in ( 1.2 ) .",
    "we shall rewrite the sum in ( 1.2 ) into an infinite number of sums of sub - series , ensuring that each sub - series is uniformly convergent even as @xmath89 .",
    "we begin , however , by assuming that @xmath10 , which makes the series in ( 1.2 ) absolutely convergent .",
    "we write the right hand side in sufficient detail so that the implementation of the partitioning scheme becomes self - evident:@xmath90    we have explicitly written out a sufficient number of terms of the right hand side of ( 1.2 ) so that those corresponding to each of the first 30 integers are clearly visible as a term is included in one ( and only one ) of the sub - series sums in ( 3.10 ) . on the right hand side ,",
    "the second term contains the integers @xmath91 ; the third contains @xmath92 ; the fourth contains @xmath93 ; the fifth contains @xmath94 ; sixth contains @xmath95 ; the seventh contains @xmath96 ; the eighth contains @xmath97 ; the ninth contains @xmath98 ; and so on .",
    "note that in the ninth , fifteenth , and twentieth terms the running index is deliberately switched from @xmath99 to @xmath100 to alert the reader to the fact that the summation starts from @xmath77 and not from @xmath101 as in all the other sums .",
    "( note that , in the ninth term , the class i integer @xmath102 is assigned to the set @xmath103 and not to the set @xmath104 , because the first term identifies @xmath22 as @xmath77 and @xmath46 as @xmath78 where as the second term onwards @xmath78 has exponents , which violates our rules of precedence and would be an illegitimate assignment given our partitioning rules . )",
    "the sub - series in ( 3.10 ) have one of two general forms:@xmath105 \\notag\\ ] ] or @xmath106\\ ] ] the above geometric series occurring within square brackets in the above two equations can actually be summed ( because they are convergent),(see whittaker and watson ) but we will refrain from doing so , and ( 1.2 ) can be rewritten as @xmath107    where the first group of summations pertain to class i integers @xmath9 characterized by the triad @xmath108 and the second group pertain to those integers which are characterized by set @xmath109 the first member in the set is a class ii integer andothers class i.    in the above we have defined the function @xmath110 of the complex variable @xmath2 which is a sub - series involving terms over only the tower @xmath49 for a class i integer as follows@xmath111    and the function @xmath112 of the complex variable @xmath2 which is a sub - series involving terms over only the tower @xmath113 whose 1st term is a class ii integer as@xmath114    with the understanding that when @xmath59 we use the function in ( 3.14 ) instead of ( 3.13 ) , we may write @xmath4 as@xmath115    comparing the above eq.(3.15 ) with eq(3.10 ) one can easily see that each term which appears as a summation in ( 3.10 ) is actually a sub - series over some tower which we denote as @xmath116 in ( 3.15 ) .",
    "so we see that @xmath4 has been broken up into a number of sub - series . the important point to note that the @xmath117 value of each term in the sub - series changes its sign from + 1 to -1 and then back to + 1 and -1 alternatively",
    ". therefore if the starting value of @xmath117 at the base was + 1 then the cumulative contribution of this tower ( sub series ) to @xmath18 as n , the upper bound , increases from @xmath19 to @xmath118 will fluctuate between be 0 and 1 .",
    "for some other tower whose base value of @xmath117 is @xmath119 then its cumulative contribution to l(n ) will fluctuate between or 0 and @xmath119 , these cumulative contributions can be represented as in the form of a rectangular wave.(figure 1 )    we have arrived at a critical point in our paper .",
    "we have cast the original function @xmath13 as a sum of functions of @xmath2 .",
    "since the triad @xmath74 uniquely characterises all integers , the summations over @xmath120 and @xmath46 above are equivalent to a summation over all positive integers @xmath9 , as in ( 1.2 ) , though not in the order @xmath121",
    ". the manner in which the triads were defined ensures that there are neither any missing integers nor integers that are duplicated .",
    "although we did not explicitly do it , we mentioned in passing that the sum over @xmath100 in ( 3.13)and ( 3.14 ) is readily performed since it is a geometric series ( see ( 3.11 ) that rapidly converges .",
    "this is true not merely for @xmath10 but also as @xmath122 . whether @xmath4 converges when the summation is carried out over all the towers @xmath49 and ,",
    "if so , over what domain , of @xmath2 is the central question that we seek to answer in the next section .",
    "the answer to which as we shall see determines the analyticity of f(s ) and thus resolves the riemannian hypothesis .",
    "we can recast ( 3.15 ) , still in the domain @xmath10 , in the form@xmath123    where @xmath124 is a function appropriately defined below .    by construction ,",
    "every @xmath9 in the above summation can be written as@xmath125    where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 are positive integers , @xmath127 is the largest prime in the factorization of @xmath9 , with either ( _ i _ ) an exponent @xmath129 , and @xmath130 is the product of primes larger than @xmath131 but with exponents equal to @xmath101 ( for class i integers ) or ( _ ii _ ) it is the largest prime factor with @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( for class ii integers ) .",
    "we define @xmath124 as follows:@xmath134    the factors @xmath135 and @xmath136 in the denominators of ( 3.13 ) and ( 3.14 ) are simply @xmath137 , where @xmath9 is the integer characterized by the @xmath72 triad ( with @xmath59 in the latter case ) .",
    "we are now in a position to examine the summatory liouville function @xmath18 by actually summing up the individual contribution from each sub - series .    to do all this systematically",
    ", we will explicitly illustrate the process starting from @xmath138 up to @xmath139 .",
    "each of these numbers is factorized and expressed uniquely as a triad .",
    "the n=1 is a constant term , which is the trivial @xmath140 , then the next number @xmath141 , is contained in the tower shown below the one corresponding to @xmath142 ; and @xmath143 , is the tower below the previous ; @xmath144 however @xmath145 is already contained in the tower @xmath146 as its second member ; the next n s : @xmath147 , give rise to the new towers @xmath148 of course is the third member of the old tower @xmath146 similarly @xmath149 is the 2nd member of @xmath150 .",
    "after this the new towers which make their appearance are : @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "now each tower @xmath49 contributes to @xmath18 ( consider n fixed in the following ) according to the following rules :    \\(i ) a particular tower will contribute only if its base number is less than or equal to n i.e @xmath153    \\(ii ) and the contribution @xmath154 , to @xmath18 from this particular tower will be exactly as follows :    case a ; class ii integer @xmath155",
    "@xmath156 , where r is the largest integer such that @xmath157    case b ; class i integer @xmath158    @xmath159 , where k is the largest integer such that @xmath160    now since each successive @xmath33 changes sign from @xmath161 to @xmath119 or vice a versa , the contributions of each tower can be thought of as a rectangular wave of ever increasing width but constant amplitude @xmath119 or @xmath161 , see figure .    to find the value of l(n )",
    "( n fixed),all we need to do is count the jumps of each wave , as we move from n=0 a jump upwards is called a positive peak a jump downwards is a negative peak . draw a vertical line at n , we are assured that it will hit one and only one peak ( positive or negative ) in one of the sub - series ; then count the total number of positive peaks p(n ) and negative peaks q(n ) , of the waves on and to the left of this vertical line , then @xmath162 ; the reason for this rule will be clear after the next section .",
    "let us take an example let s take @xmath163 , there is a positive peak for the constant term ( 1,1,1),the next wave ( 1,2,1 ) contributes one negative peak ( at 2)and a positive peak ( at 4),the wave ( 1,3,1 ) contributes a @xmath119 peak ( at 3)and ( 5,1 ) contributes a @xmath119 ( at 5)thus a total of three negative peaks and two positive peaks adding up we see that @xmath164 , which is of course correct . now",
    "if we take @xmath165,let us now draw a vertical line at n=10 , looking at this line and to its left we see that there are additionally three positive and two negative peaks thus adding this contribution of+1 to the previously calculated value @xmath166 we get @xmath167.(two red vertical lines just just beyond n=5 and n=10 are drawn for convenience ) now if wish to compute l(15 ) we see that there are three more negative peaks and two positive peaks thus giving a value @xmath168 .",
    "counting the peaks further on it is easy to check that @xmath18 is correctly predicted for every value of n up to 30 and in particular : @xmath169 ; @xmath170 and @xmath171 .    in summary to calculate l(n )",
    "we merely need to count the negative and positive peaks of the waves on n and to the left of n. in the figure we have drawn a number of waves and labeled the tower to which each belongs using a triad of numbers .",
    "they are sufficient for one to easily calculate l(n ) up to n=30 and check them out by comparing the numbers with the plot of l(n)shown on the top of the figure .",
    "we turn to a more fundamental point : we now show the distribution of value l(n ) as equivalent to the distribution obtained by summing n coin tosses .",
    "we shall now examine the analyticity of the function @xmath172 utilizing a technique introduced by littlewood ( 1912 ) . in this , we follow the treatment of edwards ( 1974 , pp .",
    "260 - 261 ) .",

    "( recall that the members of a given tower are constructed by repeated multiplication of @xmath22 . )",
    ": suppose @xmath45 is even . in this case",
    ", we need to ascertain the highest power of @xmath77 that divides @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath45 is divisible by @xmath77 but not by @xmath226 , assign @xmath227 .",
    "( so @xmath228 gets assigned to @xmath229 , and @xmath230 , by case 1 above , gets assigned to @xmath231 . ) more generally , suppose the even @xmath45 is divisible by @xmath232 but not by @xmath233 , where @xmath100 is an integer .",
    "then , if @xmath100 is even , assign @xmath234 ; and if @xmath100 is odd , assign @xmath227 .",
    "( so @xmath235 gets assigned to @xmath236 . and , in reverse",
    ", @xmath237 gets assigned to @xmath238 . )",
    "thus for odd @xmath45 the following sequence of pairs ( twins ) hold :    @xmath49 and @xmath239 are twins at bases of different towers having @xmath42s of opposite signs ,    @xmath240 and @xmath241 are twins at bases of different towers having @xmath33s of opposite signs ,    @xmath242 and @xmath243 are twins at bases of different towers having @xmath33s of opposite signs ,    and so on .    : now consider the case where the triad describes a prime number , that is , it takes the form @xmath221 .",
    "for the moment , suppose this prime number is not @xmath244 in this case , where @xmath245 , we simply assign @xmath246 .",
    "clearly ,    @xmath247 , and the numbers @xmath248 and @xmath249 are at the bases of different towers .    : finally , consider the case where the prime number is 2 , that is , the integer @xmath146 , for which @xmath250 .",
    "we match this prime to the integer @xmath101 . by definition @xmath251 .",
    "thus the first two integers have opposite signs for their values of @xmath42 . @xmath252",
    "so , in partitioning the entire set of positive integers , the number of towers that begin with integers for which @xmath253 is exactly equal to those that begin with integers for which @xmath254 .",
    "the consequences of the above theorem is that each integer has a unique twin whose @xmath33 value is of the opposite sign .",
    "this is because if the base of two towers are twins the next higher number in the first tower is the twin of the next higher number in the second tower , and so on .",
    "theorem 2 has the immediate implication that , we believe , has never been established to date ( see borwein et al ( 2006 ) ) :    _ theorem 3 : in the set of all positive integers , for every integer which has an even number of primes in its factorization there is another unique integer ( its twin ) whose factorization has an odd number of factors . _    in the first part of this section we detailed littlewood s proof of his criteria ( theorem 1 ) for the condition that must hold for a function such as @xmath4 , to be analytically continuable to the line @xmath255 , when it is known that it is analytic in the region @xmath10 .",
    "the need to do this was because we wished to use his criteria for our function @xmath4 which is given in the form ( 3.10)or ( 3.15 ) above .",
    "so we have to find whether @xmath256 the crucial value is the exponent @xmath190 which needs to be found,(of course r.h predicts @xmath257 , but this has to be confirmed ) . in other words",
    "we need to study the growth of @xmath18 as @xmath19 becomes very large .    in this section",
    "we also derived two more theorems , viz theorem 2 and theorem 3 , which we will be needing to find the value of this exponent @xmath190 .",
    "we are nearing the final leg of our journey .",
    "however , to come to a proper conclusion regarding the riemann hypothesis we need some more investigations to determine the proper behavior of l(n ) in order to find the true value of the exponent @xmath190 and thereby settle the riemann hypothesis .",
    "hence this will be our task in the next sections .",
    "now we will investigate the properties of the summatory liouville function @xmath258 .",
    "we perform the investigation under two separate ( exclusive cases ) case 1 , when the sequence is expected to be non - random and case 2 , when the sequence is expected to be random .",
    "we are forced to resort to this because the literature is ambivalent about the random nature of prime numbers and prime factorization . and as there is no telling ab initio whether the lioville sequence behaves like case 1 or as case 2 .",
    "so we investigate both the cases and report our findings .",
    "we need to define precisely what we mean by a ` non - random behavior ' so that we can proceed with our mathematical investigation . here",
    "we follow the criteria of many computer scientists , who believe that a sequence can be considered truly random if the sequence does not repeat and any sequence that repeats no matter how much later , should not be considered random .",
    "( see press.etal or donald knuth ) we will adopt this definition because it seems appropriate and precisely definable .",
    "so in this subsection we assume that the sequence of lambdas is inherently cyclic and repeats after some @xmath259 consecutive numbers .",
    "our first step is to verify if this scenario is really possible at all .",
    "we do this by using the fact that every @xmath260 can be calculated if we know which tower the particular number @xmath9 belongs to",
    ". then we check out if two numbers belonging to the sequence but occurring in different cycles can really be members of the same tower(we are really checking for consistency as the foregoing will clarify ) . after",
    "that we estimate the contribution to l(n ) from such a hypothetical sequence and then examine the consequences .    *",
    "a non - random sequence * is a sequence of @xmath259 consecutive integers    @xmath261 which are such that the related sequence : generated by the liouville function viz : @xmath262 repeats .",
    "since the integers are consecutive @xmath263 and the @xmath117 seuence repeats : @xmath264 for ever positive integer @xmath100 , @xmath265 .",
    "now if we denote    @xmath266    for all integer @xmath267 , therefore the entire sequence after @xmath268 , has the form :    @xmath269    @xmath270    we then call the set of consecutive numbers @xmath271 , these are of course a collection of @xmath161 s and @xmath119 s in random order .    and",
    "in ( 4 ) we call the first @xmath259 numbers as the first cycle , the next @xmath259 numbers as the 2nd cycle and so on , of course the overall sequence has a period @xmath259",
    ".    * a.1 investigation : *    we will now investigate belonging to a cycle the probability of @xmath272 , is exactly equal to the probability of @xmath273 . but",
    "this already follows from theorem 3 which is for the general case , so if @xmath259 is finite this conclusion is inescapable and one can skip all this and goto the paragraph final conclusion: preceding eq . 6.11 .",
    "the only reason why the author has included this subsection in this paper is because of the curious appearance of fermat s little theorem into the argument to satisfy consistency . ] the conditions under which a tower @xmath274 can generate numbers which belong to @xmath275 , ( note we do not assume a single tower can generate all numbers in the cycle ) .",
    "let us suppose @xmath275 as defined above , is really such a sequence .",
    "let us take some prime p which belongs to a tower @xmath49 , and consider the terms in the tower of class i integers    @xmath276    now since @xmath259 is finite it is obvious that @xmath277 must be a number somewhere in some cycle let us say it is equal to the @xmath278 @xmath279 term in the @xmath280 cycle . but",
    "the integer value of the @xmath278 @xmath281 term is : @xmath282 therefore we must have the value of @xmath277 equal the former :    @xmath283 @xmath284 of course by the very definition of the sequence and its periodicity we will have    @xmath285    now the list of numbers in ( 5 ) are infinite but the cycle length @xmath259is finite ; also all the numbers in ( 5 ) occur as a term in some cycle , so there is bound to be some cycle n where the term : @xmath286 where @xmath287 again is equal to the @xmath278 @xmath279 term :    so we then have :    @xmath288    subtracting ( 7 ) from ( 8) we have the following requirement for consistency :    @xmath289    there is no loss in generality if we assume , for the time being , the length of a cycle is a prime , is not a multiple of a prime say @xmath290 , b an integer , we can just define @xmath9 as @xmath291 , so the eq .",
    "following has the same form .",
    "] so let us put @xmath292 , and @xmath293 and @xmath294 we then have from ( 9 ) :    @xmath295    but we have assumed @xmath22 to be an arbitrary prime and equation ( 6.10 ) tells us that all primes @xmath22 are such that there exists two exponents @xmath296 such that they are multiples of a fixed prime q. at first sight this seems to be a rather remote possibility , but we will now prove that this will actually happen not for just some rare primes but actually for every prime p and any given prime q which we consider as fixed .",
    "this consequence is due to fermat s little theorem .",
    "there is no loss if we consider that p and q are prime to each ( other wise we can write q = gq,and the gcd g can be absorbed in n ) .",
    "fermat s little theorem states that under these conditions we can always choose @xmath297 then @xmath298 will always be divisible by q , this permits us to divide ( 6.10 ) out by q then choose @xmath9 such that the consistency test ( 6.10 ) is satisfied .",
    "so we have arrived at our following theorem .",
    "* theorem : * given a repeating sequence of type ( 6.4 ) with fixed periodicity , @xmath259 , then every tower of type @xmath49 , for every prime p , is contained in the sequence in the sense given by eq(6.8 ) .",
    "now we argue using the following facts :    \\(i ) the number of towers are infinite and    \\(ii ) the length @xmath259 is finite , further we know that    \\(iii ) the sequence(6.4 ) contains identical cycles each of which is actually repetitions of :    @xmath299 ,    but we have already proved ( theorem 3)that    \\(iv ) the total number of @xmath300 which are equal to @xmath161 is exactly equal to the total number which are equal to@xmath119 .",
    "this means that    \\(v ) the number of + 1 s within @xmath301 is exactly equal to the number of -1s.,but we have proved that    ( vi)each of these members can be generated by some or other tower of type @xmath49 , but    \\(vii ) these towers are infinite in number and the members belonging to a cycle are only @xmath259 ( finite ) in number .",
    "@xmath302    * final conclusion : therefore the only minimal conclusion * that we can come to is that given some fixed number @xmath303 belonging to a sequence of consecutive integers @xmath304 the chances of @xmath305 being equal to @xmath161 is exactly equal to the probability that @xmath305 is equal to @xmath119 . and",
    "this is true for all members @xmath303 in the cycle and since we have assumed that the whole sequence is cyclic , this statement is true for every integer @xmath9 .",
    "( except of course , for the finite number which are less than @xmath306 - the beginning of the sequence .",
    "we ignore these because they are only finite in number ) .",
    "so we can then assume as we compute    @xmath307    starting from @xmath308 up to @xmath19 , step by step , then the answer that we will get is like computing a sum of @xmath309 random variables defined as :    @xmath310    where @xmath189 is a random variable and its @xmath311 value takes on the values @xmath161 or @xmath119 with equal probability .",
    "this is exactly the same as summing up to n , however since we are dealing with a cyclic sequences whose @xmath117 values have exactly @xmath312 @xmath161 s and @xmath119 s within one cycle .",
    "therefore if we sum up to @xmath313 , we would get@xmath314 as exactly zero ( ie if we stop summing @xmath19 exactly after @xmath315 cycles ) , but this will not happen often so we would usually find that after summing to a random @xmath19 a value which varies from 0 to @xmath312 , since every cycle has @xmath312 , @xmath161 s and @xmath312 , @xmath119 s , in random order within the length @xmath312 , therefore if you add consecutive values of say @xmath316 terms you will get a minimum value of 0 when all of them cancel and a maximum value of @xmath312 , if all the @xmath161 occur together in the first half of a cycle and also @xmath317 , @xmath100 : an integer .",
    "@xmath318    though we have gone about deriving the above in a rather long - winded manner , this final result is not surprising because it is what one would expect to get when we sum a cyclic sequence which has equal number of @xmath161 s and @xmath119 s terms in one cycle ( albeit randomly distributed within the length @xmath319 ) .    but",
    "now if this value is substituted to littlewood s condition , and we take the limit @xmath320 we get zero .",
    "this means that we should be able to analytically continue @xmath321 left - words from @xmath322 to @xmath323 .",
    "but it is common knowledge ( see hardy)that there are very many zeros at @xmath324 and these will appear as poles in @xmath4 , hence we really can not continue @xmath4 to @xmath325 , this fact indicates that the period @xmath319 can not be a finite number . in other words",
    "it is the nature of the number system that a sequence of consecutive lambdas can never be cyclic with a finite sequence of length @xmath259 .",
    "so in this section we have concluded the only viable case to be examined is the case when the sequence of lambdas is noncyclic or `` random '' .",
    "this is done in the next section .",
    "we now again consider the series @xmath326    it has already been proved in this paper that , over the set of all positive integers , the respective probabilities that an integer @xmath9 has an odd or even number of prime factors are equal .",
    "that is , the probability of @xmath260 being + 1 or -1 are both 1/2 .",
    "so , @xmath327 where @xmath328 , can with equal probability , be either + 1 or -1 .",
    "if , in addition , it is assumed that the probabilities affecting the values of @xmath329 and @xmath330 , @xmath331 , are independent of each other , then we could deduce    @xmath332    and then through an application of littlewood s argument , rh can be proved .",
    "we will show below that @xmath329 and @xmath330 are indeed _ independent _ random variables that are _ uncorrelated _ with each other as @xmath19 tends to infinity .",
    "+      we have seen in a previous section that each tower makes it appearance , while computing @xmath18 , from @xmath333 the criteria was the tower with the base value @xmath334 makes its appearance when @xmath335 .",
    "now the summation in the figure is actually performed as : @xmath336 to appreciate the relevance of the independence of the @xmath329 s in eq .",
    "( 7.14 ) , consider the series : @xmath337 where again @xmath9 is a positive integer , and the summation ( partial ) is being taken over a single tower and @xmath338 is + 1 or -1 depending on whether @xmath9 is even or odd",
    ". therefore @xmath339 it is evident that the probabilities that @xmath338 is + 1 or -1 are equal , as was the case with @xmath260 . however , here for any @xmath19 , @xmath340 can either be 0 or 1,(we assume for convenience the base value of the tower has @xmath341 else the oscillations will be between 0 and -1 ) and certainly does not scale as @xmath342 .",
    "this is because the @xmath343 s are perfectly correlated , and we are certain that if @xmath344 is 1 then @xmath345 and vice versa .",
    "here we see that the _ correlation interval _ , which we will define as the shortest distance along the ordered set of integers for which by knowing one value of a random variable we can predict ( or predict with better than even probability ) the value of another . to invalidate the equivalence of ( 7.15 ) , it matters little if the correlation interval is 1 or 100 , or @xmath346 , as any finite correlation interval would negate the independence of the random numbers making up the sequence in ( 7.17 ) or ( 7.16 ) + we have earlier demonstrated that all positive integers can be partitioned into subsets @xmath347 such that @xmath348 where the prime factorisation of @xmath349    with @xmath350 , is used to define    @xmath351 and @xmath352 ,    where @xmath353 is the highest prime in the factorization with multiplicity greater than one .",
    "we have also shown that every consecutive pair in either of these types of subsets are  twins \" with opposite values , and thus are perfectly correlated  by knowing the value of one we know the value of the other .",
    "+ now consider the correlation interval of a pair of twins ( @xmath354 ) in an arbitrary subset @xmath347 .",
    "we see that this is @xmath355 now consider that every subset @xmath347 , except the trivial single - element one containing the integer 1 , is infinite and is ordered by @xmath100 which increases to infinity . as @xmath356 and @xmath357",
    ", the correlation interval will increase without bound , as @xmath100 increases , so @xmath358 in _ every _ subset @xmath347 . as the sum in ( 7.16 )",
    "is over all such subsets , it follows that the correlation interval for the entire set of @xmath260 s tends to infinity , when @xmath359 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath260 s are not correlated with each other and are independent random variables with equal probability of being + 1 or -1 , and so should sum to @xmath342 , ( see chandrasekhar ( 1943)),thus we have at last established that the exponent @xmath257.invoking littlewood s theorem ( sec.5 ) , we deduce that @xmath360 is analytic in the region @xmath361 which implies @xmath362 has no zeros in the same region .",
    "but riemann had shown by using symmetry arguments is the euler gamma function , then showed that this xi function has the symmetry property @xmath363 which in turn implied that that the zeros of @xmath362 ( if any ) which are not on the critical line will be symmetrically placed about the point s=1/2 , ie.if @xmath364 is a zero then @xmath365 ) is a zero see whittaker and watson page 269 . ]",
    "that if @xmath362 has no zeros in the latter region then it will have no zeros in the region @xmath366 , taking both these results together we are lead to the inevitable conclusion : that all the zeros can only lie on the critical line @xmath7 , thus proving the riemann hypothesis .      in this section",
    "we give a reason as to why things worked so well and and we could actually prove what we have proved .",
    "we have already seen that as @xmath19 tends to infinity there will be an ever increasing number of rectangular waves , see figure 1 ( or eq.(5.23b)for details ) , participating in the summatory liouville function @xmath18 and each of these contributions make @xmath18 completely uncorrelated with l(n-1),l(n-2),etc and rh follows .    in the following we will be arguing by using an analogy from information theory first discovered by shannon,(shannon ( 1948 ) )",
    "we will call a tower which contributes @xmath161 s and @xmath119 s to @xmath18 as a broadcaster of bits and the contribution @xmath367 , increases or decreases the collection of bits @xmath18 collated by the listener according as @xmath161 arrives first or @xmath119 arrives first at @xmath368 . essentially , each tower is a broadcaster of rectangular waves of ever increasing periods . according to shannon",
    "every sequence is information . and",
    "the ` message ' in a sequence of bits can be said to contain information if there is at least some relationship between the present group of bits to the preceding group of bits ( like words in a sentence ) .",
    "we show in the argument following that the nature of the towers in ( 5.23 b ) destroy this information as @xmath19 tends to infinity .",
    "the situation is describable as follows :    \\(i ) it has been revealed that the contributions to @xmath18 , is coming from towers .",
    "if we keep @xmath19 fixed then the contribution @xmath367 to the previous summed value @xmath369 is exactly equal to @xmath370 , so @xmath371 .",
    "but we know that the integer @xmath19 is a member of a unique tower which we denote as the set @xmath49 and some member in this is exactly equal to @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath372 , in fact the triad @xmath49 and exponent @xmath373 are uniquely obtained by factorizing @xmath19 .",
    "we then have @xmath374 , which is completely determined .",
    "we had represented these contributions from a particular tower as rectangular waves in fig 1 .",
    "\\(ii ) the contributions from the rectangular wave associated with a fixed @xmath49 change with the sign of the positive or negative peak arriving at @xmath19 and as @xmath373 increases from @xmath375 their duration exponentially increases thus delaying their arrival times and drastically increasing their correlation lengths .",
    "( iii)but each tower contributes to different @xmath19 s but the distance along @xmath19 increases exponentially as @xmath373 increases i.e.the arrival times at the listener increases .",
    "\\(iv ) the same situation as ( i),(ii ) and ( iii ) happens for every other time @xmath368 from 1 to infinity , while @xmath18 takes contributions from other towers .",
    "\\(vi ) each tower @xmath49 comes into play as soon as @xmath368 reaches the base value of the tower i.e.@xmath376 after this @xmath19 , this particular tower broadcasts bits in ever increasing time intervals forever .",
    "\\(vii ) as @xmath19 tends to infinity in - numerable towers come into play and each broadcasted bit received at time @xmath19 becomes completely uncorrelated to the bit received at time @xmath377 , so @xmath367 has no relation to @xmath378 essentially because @xmath367 and @xmath378 come from different towers .",
    "@xmath283    @xmath283 and according to shannon s information theory there will be no pattern in the bits and the entropy of the signal approaches infinity . at this point @xmath367",
    "behaves like a coin toss and @xmath18 as the cumulative summation of @xmath19 coin tosses , ( see chandrasekhar ( 1943)),thus we have @xmath379 as @xmath19 tends to infinity proving rh .",
    "so we have seen that the rh is because of inherent randomness of factorization of @xmath19 into primes .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the analyticity of the dirichlet series of the liouville function by constructing a novel way to sum the series .",
    "the method consists in splitting the original series into an infinite sum over sub - series , each of which is convergent .",
    "it so turns out each sub - series is a rectangular function of unit amplitude but ever increasing periodicity and each along with its harmonics is associated with a prime number and all of them contribute to the summatory liouville function and to the zeta function .",
    "a number of arithmetical properties of numbers played a role in the proof of our main theorem , these were : the fact that each number can be uniquely factorized and then placed in an exclusive subset , where it and its other members form an increasing sequence and factorize alternately into odd and even factors ; and each subset can be labelled uniquely using a triad of integers which in their turn can be used to determine all the integers which belong to the subset , even fermat s little theorem played a role in our proof .",
    "in this paper we have also demonstrated that for every integer that has an even number of primes as factors ( multiplicity included ) , there is an integer that has an odd number of primes .",
    "this provides a proof for the long - suspected but unproved conjecture  until now  that the summatory liouville function and therefore the riemann hypothesis bears an analogy with the coin - tossing problem , denjoy had long suspected this as far back as 1931 .",
    "further , it has now been revealed that the randomness of the occurrence of prime numbers plays an important role in determining the analyticity of the zeta function , and in establishing the riemann hypothesis : the zeta function has zeros only on the critical line:@xmath12 .",
    "truth to tell even this connection of the role of the randomness of the primes to the rh problem was long suspected and even a book called the  music of the primes \" by marcus du sautoy , had appeared in 2003 ( harper collins ) , i could not help but recall the title of his book when i saw the rhythms of the harmonic functions , generated by prime numbers , that are depicted in fig 1 .",
