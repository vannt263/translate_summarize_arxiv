    "the multiphase nature of the intracluster medium ( ) in cooling flows was demonstrated a decade ago when deprojections of x - ray surface - brightness profiles showed that mass cools and is deposited from the flow in a distributed manner , @xmath4 ( thomas , fabian & nulsen 1987 ) .",
    "however , the complexity of the theory and lack of data with high spatial resolution means that the single - phase approximation is still widely adopted . in this paper",
    "i show how the use of self - similar density distributions can lead to a relatively simple form for the multiphase cooling flow equations whilst spanning the whole range of expected behaviours in the more general case . in combination with the emissivity profile ( for a spherically - symmetric flow )",
    ", the equations can be solved to yield the gas temperature and mass profiles within the cooling flow .    in section",
    "[ sec : dd ] , i introduce the concept of the volume fraction to describe the distribution of density phases in the .",
    "the self - similar forms of the volume fraction are determined and shown to span all reasonable behaviours for the more general situation . the steady - state , self - similar form of the cooling flow equations",
    "are derived in  [ sec : theory ] and it is shown how these can be solved in the spherically - symmetric case if the emissivity profile is known .",
    "the behaviour of the solutions is examined in detail : not every emissivity profile is consistent with these models . in",
    "[ sec : abell ] , the theory is applied to rosat hri data for three abell clusters with some success .",
    "finally , the results are summarised and further discussed in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the theory of multiphase cooling flows was set out by nulsen ( 1986 ) .",
    "he introduced the concept of the volume fraction , @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 is the fractional volume occupied by phases with densities in the range @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "it is assumed that the phases comove but are thermally isolated from one another  these can be regarded as empirical facts as otherwise the flow would rapidly evolve to a single - phase state .",
    "given these assumptions then it is relatively straightforward to derive an equation for the evolution of the volume fraction ( see appendix ) .",
    "writing f=(2-)_0w^(4-)/(2-)g(w,,t ) , where w=(_0)^2- and @xmath9 , then + ( 3-)_0- 2-p+.=0 [ eq : gdot ] where the dot refers to a covariant derivate , following the flow .    in general @xmath10 is a complicated function of position and time .",
    "however , we can look for solutions in which @xmath10 has a constant functional form , @xmath11 . only the first term in  [ eq : gdot ] depends upon @xmath12 .",
    "hence we require that @xmath13 .",
    "there are two kinds of solution :    1 .",
    "this is the most extended distribution which is convectively stable ( it gives @xmath15 ) .",
    "it includes phases of arbitrarily low density .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 ; @xmath18 .",
    "these solutions possess a minimum density , @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the least extended , consisting solely of the power - law cooling tail . as @xmath3",
    "the solutions resemble @xmath21 .",
    "for other forms of @xmath10 one must resort to numerical integration to follow their evolution .",
    "thomas ( 1988b ) looked at the steady - state evolution of a range of distributions with a sharp cut - off at low densities and reached the following conclusions :    * all distributions develop a high - density tail , @xmath22 , as they cool . *",
    "sufficiently narrow distributions resemble the pure power - law @xmath23 by the time they begin to be deposited .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath21 bound all reasonable solutions of the cooling flow equations , be they self - similar in form or not . in principle , @xmath0 could be less than unity ( as @xmath24 the flow tends to the homogeneous case ) but it is difficult to see how such distributions could arise .",
    "if the large density variations inferred within the cooling radius result from amplification of an initially much narrower distribution , then values of @xmath0 of order unity are to be preferred . without a plausible formation history for the icm , however , it is better to leave @xmath0 as a free parameter to be determined empirically .",
    "i will argue below that low values of @xmath0 fit the observations of cooling flows in abell clusters better than high values .",
    "the self - similar density distributions derived in  [ sec : dd ] lead to particularly simple forms of the steady - state cooling flow equations .",
    "i derive these below and then show in the next section how they can be combined with the emissivity profile to provide strong constraints of the mass distribution within the cooling radius .      substituting the functional form of @xmath25 into  [ eq : mass1 ] , [ eq : beta ] and [ eq : gdot ]",
    "we see that the self - similar forms of the cooling flow equations are : -1p- ( 2-)k=0 and + .+=0 , where = ( 2-)k-1n_0 ^ 2(t_0)p . to these",
    "may be added the equation of hydrostatic support , + p|=0 , where @xmath26 is the gravitational potential .",
    "i assume here that the inflow is subsonic  this turns out to be a good approximation in all multiphase cooling flow models .    in a steady - state and spherical symmetry",
    "the above equations reduce to = -2 , = -2 - 2- , and = -2 + 2 + ( 12-+k ) , where = gm2r.m_hk_bt is the ratio of the virial to the thermal temperatures , and = ( 2-)-1n_0 ^ 2(t_0)p ru=1kr is the ratio of the inflow time to the constant - pressure cooling time .",
    "although there appear to be three equations here , the dimensionless ratios @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the only important variables .",
    "the third equation merely acts as a scaling ( for fixed @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "hence the physics can be captured in just two equations : = -1 + 2 - 1- 2- and = 3- 2- ( 3 - 2-+k)where @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath21 equations can be recovered by letting @xmath3 and using @xmath31 in place of @xmath28 as the second dimensionless variable .",
    "the usual way of proceeding when solving the single - phase equations is to pick a functional form for the mass profile , @xmath32 , and mass deposition rate , @xmath33 , then to solve for @xmath27 and @xmath28 . from this one can generate an emissivity profile , @xmath34 , for comparison with the data . here",
    "i adopt a different approach : because @xmath33 is fixed ( for a particular value of @xmath0 ) in the multiphase models , one can specify @xmath34 and _ determine _ the mass profile .",
    "suppose that @xmath35 is known .",
    "then @xmath36 furthermore this is an eigenvalue problem : requiring that the solution extend to @xmath37 fixes the outer boundary condition .",
    "hence we can solve for @xmath28 , @xmath27 and @xmath32 .",
    "we can get a good idea of the behaviour of the solutions to  [ eq : tau ] by looking at the case of constant @xmath38 . imposing the physical constraints @xmath39 ( a non - negative temperature ) and @xmath40 ( mass constant or increasing with radius ) restricts @xmath38 to lie in the range [ eq : krange ] ( in this expression and henceforth i set @xmath41 and @xmath42 rather than including them explicitly ) .",
    "thus steep emissivity profiles , @xmath43 , are incompatible will all steady - state cooling flow models ( larger values can occur , however , outside the cooling radius ) .",
    "in addition , the inner value of @xmath38 can be used to constrain @xmath0 : flat cores are inconsistent with small values of @xmath0 and a central decrease in emissivity would be incompatible with all models . if we assume that the virial temperature drops ( @xmath44 ) within the cluster core , then the central value of @xmath38 provides a _ measure _ of @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical solutions of  [ eq : tau ] in the case of non - constant @xmath38 are illustrated in  [ fig : test ] . here",
    "i have set @xmath45 and @xmath20 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the speed at which solutions diverge away from the desired one ( the one which extends to @xmath37 ) as @xmath46 decreases .",
    "this ensures that the solutions are insensitive to the inner boundary condition and are stable to small variations in the value of @xmath38 in the inner bin ( which is most likely to be affected by the point - spread function , uncertain absorption correction , ) .",
    "the difference in the two values of @xmath28 at @xmath47 in the figure is less than one percent .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that the solutions are able to cope with quite large variations in @xmath38 : in this case 100 fluctuations drawn from a uniform distribution of extent @xmath48 have been added to each decade in @xmath46 . despite the fact that @xmath38 now varies outside both ends of the physical range described in  [ eq : krange ] , it remains true to the smooth solution .    in this paper",
    "we will fit smooth functions to observed emissivity profiles before attempting to solve the cooling flow equations .",
    "i will now apply the above theory to three cooling flow clusters : a85 , a745 and a2025 .",
    "the rosat hri data were kindly supplied to me by clovis peres in the form of deprojected density and temperature profiles .",
    "this has the advantage that conversion of the counts into emissivity , including correction for the spectral response and absorption , has already been included .",
    "provided that the cooling flow solutions resemble the deprojected one , then these corrections will hold good .",
    "i will consider each of the clusters in turn .",
    "the emissivity profile is shown in  [ fig : a85xi ] .",
    "there are 23 annular bins , each 12 arcsec wide , of which the inner 9 have cooling times less than @xmath49yr ( throughout this paper i take @xmath50kms@xmath51mpc@xmath51 ) .",
    "the profile is well - fit by a simple broken power - law fit , ^-1 .",
    "the asymptotic slope of @xmath52 as @xmath24 is very close to the minimum permitted for @xmath20 which suggests that the solution will require an inner core in the mass distribution .",
    "this is illustrated in  [ fig : a85k001 ] .",
    "note that @xmath27 drops very close to zero at @xmath53kpc ( it tends to a small constant value within this radius ) . the gravitational density profile ( that of the total mass , not just the gas ) is well - fit at radii greater than 20kpc by a king model , _",
    "grav ^-1.25 . within this radius the density",
    "is poorly constrained .",
    "although it appears to rise , only a small change in the slope of @xmath52 would cause it to level off or even fall  all we know for sure is that the virial temperature becomes very small .",
    "note also that there is only one bin within 20kpc and this one is most likely to be affected by smoothing by the point - spread function , uncertain correction for excess absorption , etc .",
    "the temperature of the gas is approximately constant outside the core radius , but drops by a factor of five in to 10kpc .",
    "a temperature decline in the centre of clusters is typical of cooling flows observed by asca .",
    "note that the slope of the mass - deposition profile , @xmath28 , is close to unity within the cooling radius , @xmath54kpc .",
    "this radius is not a special one for our solutions as we have assumed the cooling flow solution holds everywhere .",
    "for this reason the asymptotic slope of the gravitational density profile at larger radii should be taken with a pinch of salt .",
    "the corresponding solution for @xmath55 is shown in  [ fig : a85k100 ] .",
    "there in no core in the gravitational mass profile in this case , with @xmath56 rising as @xmath57 all the way into 10kpc .",
    "this is reflected in the temperature profile , however , which also rises by a factor of 5 between 150 and 10kpc , unlike any observed cluster .",
    "the emissivity profile , shown in  [ fig : a745xi ] , has 19 bins of width 8 arcsec , with 912 bins interior to the cooling radius ( @xmath58240kpc ) .",
    "the first thing to note is that @xmath52 flattens considerably in the innermost bin .",
    "this is incompatible with density distributions with small values of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact the fit shown by the solid line , ^-1 admits solutions which extend to @xmath37 only for @xmath55 .",
    "unfortunately , just as for a85 , large values of @xmath0 give steeply rising dark - matter density and temperature profiles at small radii .",
    "if we ignore the inner bin , however , then it is possible to find solutions for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "the dotted line in  [ fig : a745xi ] shows the emissivity profile which corresponds to a mass density _ grav ^-1.57 . and @xmath20 .      for a2029",
    "there are 79 bins of width 12 arcsec within the cooling radius , @xmath59210kpc .",
    "the emissivity profile ^-1 . shown in  [ fig :",
    "a2029xi ] is again too shallow in the central bin , but the inconsistency is this time so slight that it strengthens the case for @xmath20 ( as discussed in  [ sec : behaviour ] the slope of the emissivity profile within the cluster core provides a measure of @xmath0 ) .",
    "[ fig : a2029k001]a shows that @xmath27 drops to a value close to zero within 30kpc .",
    "this indicates that the virial temperature has sunk well below the gas temperature ( the flow is isobaric within this radius ) .",
    "this is reflected in  [ fig : a2029k001]b which shows the corresponding density profile .",
    "the latter is well - fit at radii greater than 80kpc by a mass - density _ grav ^-1 but declines rapidly within this radius .",
    "only a small change in the emissivity profile is required to generate solutions in which the gravitational mass has a constant core density , as indicated by the dotted line in  [ fig : a2029xi ] which reproduces the above density profile exactly .",
    "* i have rederived the cooling flow equations for self - similar density distributions .",
    "two of these in particular are expected to bound the behaviour of all possible flows . *",
    "the steady - state cooling flow equations are _ not _ compatible will all conceivable emissivity profiles .",
    "thus they can be used as a test of the theory .",
    "* the solutions provide bounds on @xmath60 within the cooling radius and given @xmath0 can be used to measure @xmath60 .",
    "* rosat hri surface brightness data from three abell clusters are best - fit by models in which @xmath61 .",
    "the measured core radii are then 110140@xmath62kpc .",
    "larger values of @xmath0 give smaller ( or non - existent ) core radii , but have gas temperatures which rise sharply at small radii , in contrast with the observations .",
    "it is unfortunate that the core radii deduced for the matter distributions for the abell clusters under investigation are only slightly smaller than the radii of the cooling flows .",
    "it is possible that the self - similar , steady - state assumption is a poor one at the edge of the flow ( it is also possible that it is valid well beyond the cooling radius ) and that models could be found which were consistent with a much larger core radius .",
    "ideally , one would like a much better resolution at smaller radii , so that the tendency of the emissivity profile to a constant slope , indicative of the particular value of @xmath0 , could be checked .",
    "this should be possible for some of the closer clusters , such as virgo .",
    "note that the solutions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 given in this paper do not depend upon the normalisations of the gas and total gravitational masses .",
    "if desired , these can be determined by fixing the overall temperature and luminosity .",
    "the analysis of gunn & thomas ( 1996 ) shows that the gas density will be slightly lower and the total mass density slightly higher than in the equivalent single - phase analysis .",
    "cooling flows in individual galaxies are much better resolved than those in clusters and so look like promising candidates for the kind of modelling discussed here .",
    "however , the lower temperatures leads to complications such as a varying slope , @xmath63 , for the cooling function , and larger corrections for absorption and emission lying outside the pass - band of the detector .",
    "there may also be sources of mass and energy injection into the flow .",
    "this paper was prepared using the facilities of the starlink minor node at sussex .",
    "it was written while pat was holding a nuffield foundation science research fellowship .",
    "we assume an emulsion of density phases which comove with the flow .",
    "the distribution is described by the volume fraction , @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 is the fractional volume occupied by phases with densities in the range @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath64 , and the mean density is @xmath65 .",
    "mass conservation gives ( f)+.(f)+ ( f)=0 , [ eq : mass ] where @xmath66 is the rate of change of position and @xmath67 is the rate of change of density following the flow . the final term in  [ eq : mass ] is the equivalent in density space of the divergence in velocity space .",
    "integrating over all densities we obtain + .+=0 , [ eq : mass1 ] where _ ( f ) .",
    "[ eq : beta ] this is equivalent to the usual single - phase equation ( thomas 1988a ) except that the mass deposition rate is specified in terms of @xmath68 rather than being a free parameter .    to find how the volume fraction changes with time we use the energy equation , = -n^2 , [ eq : sdot ] where @xmath69 is",
    "the entropy and @xmath70 is the radiated power per unit volume . for a fully - ionised plasma s(p^ ) .",
    "[ eq : entropy ] where @xmath71 is the pressure , @xmath72 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath73 is the mass per particle and @xmath41 . then = 1p+ -1n^2p .",
    "[ eq : energy ]    over a wide temperature range appropriate to clusters the cooling function can be approximated by a power - law , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "then  [ eq : energy ] can be simplified by moving to a new density variable .",
    "writing = _ 0(,t)w^-1/(2- ) , [ eq : wdef ] we obtain = ( 2-)(_0- 1p)w- ( 2-)-1n_0 ^ 2(t_0)p .",
    "[ eq : wdot ] if the adiabatic compression term is removed by setting @xmath15 , then the energy equation takes a particularly simple form , @xmath76constant .",

    ", we see that at high density when cooling is dominant , then @xmath78constant .",
    "this motivates the substitution f=(2-)_0w^(4-)/(2-)g(w,,t ) .",
