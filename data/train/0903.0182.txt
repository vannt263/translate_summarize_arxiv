    "we begin by noting that under hypotheses @xmath16 and @xmath17 the pair - specific ground state energy @xmath8 defined in ( [ pairspecpotenergy ] ) is well - defined ; i.e. @xmath18 .    to prove the monotonicity of @xmath15 , with @xmath19 , let @xmath5 denote the @xmath1-body ground state energy , i.e. @xmath20 . using the definition of @xmath5 and the elementary graph - theoretical identity that the sum over all bonds in a complete @xmath1-graph ( @xmath21 ) equals @xmath22 the sum over all bonds of all its complete @xmath23-subgraphs , and using the single inequality that the minimum of a sum is not less than the sum of the minima , we find @xmath24 \\nonumber\\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\ ! & & \\geq { \\textstyle{\\frac{1}{n-1}}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\sum_{\\quad 1\\leq k \\leq n+1 } \\biggl [ \\min_{\\{{{{\\boldsymbol { { q } } } } } _ 1,\\dots,{{{\\boldsymbol { { q } } } } } _ { n+1}\\}\\backslash\\{{{{\\boldsymbol { { q } } } } } _ k\\ } } \\sum\\sum_{\\hskip-.7truecm \\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1\\leq i < j\\leq n+1 } { i\\neq k\\neq j } } { u}_\\lambda({{{\\boldsymbol { { q } } } } } _ i,{{{\\boldsymbol { { q } } } } } _ j ) \\biggr ] \\nonumber\\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\ ! & & = { \\textstyle{\\frac{n+1}{n-1 } } }   \\min_{\\{{{{\\boldsymbol { { q } } } } } _ 1,\\dots,{{{\\boldsymbol { { q } } } } } _ { n}\\ } } \\sum\\sum_{\\hskip-.7truecm { 1\\leq i < j\\leq n } } { u}_\\lambda({{{\\boldsymbol { { q } } } } } _ i,{{{\\boldsymbol { { q } } } } } _ j ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!&&=\\ { \\textstyle{\\frac{n+1}{n-1}}}\\,{{\\cal e}}_g(n ) . \\label{potenergymono}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] dividing ( [ potenergymono ] ) by @xmath25 yields @xmath26 , and the proof of the monotonicity of @xmath27 is complete .    as already remarked in appendix a of @xcite , proposition [ prop : upernsqminusn ] and its proof are quite elementary and presumably known , yet after a serious search in the pertinent literature i came up empty - handed , and additional consultation with several of my local expert colleagues have given me the impression that proposition [ prop : upernsqminusn ] is perhaps not known , and in any event not widely known .    in this brief note",
    "we will be concerned with a very practical application of proposition [ prop : upernsqminusn ] which certainly is not generally known , as we will demonstrate .",
    "namely , the monotonic increase with @xmath1 of the true pair - specific ground state energies @xmath8 furnishes a whole family of _ necessary criteria for minimality _ which any empirical list of computer - experimental data @xmath28 for such ground state energies needs to satisfy ; put differently , we have the following _ sufficient criterion for failure to be minimal _ : @xmath29 for each @xmath30 one can use ( [ failurecrit ] ) as a test for any computer - experimentally produced list of putative ground state energies @xmath31 .",
    "of course , if any particular @xmath3 passes the @xmath32-th test for each @xmath33 ,",
    "i.e. if @xmath34 , this does not mean that this @xmath3 is a true ground state energy ; only _ failing a test is significant _",
    ", for ( [ failurecrit ] ) asserts that _ a test - failing @xmath3 is surely not a ground state energy_. moreover , whenever @xmath3 fails any such test , then by proposition [ prop : upernsqminusn ] we also get a better empirical upper bound on the true ground state energy @xmath5 than @xmath3 from the remaining data of the computer - generated list @xmath35 : @xmath36 note that ( [ upperboundegn ] ) is always true , but it only leads to a better empirical upper bound on @xmath5 than @xmath3 when @xmath3 fails a test .",
    "note also that the computer - experimental data supply empirical upper bounds to the actual ground state energies within the numerical accuracy , i.e. we always have @xmath37 .",
    "subjecting some publically available lists of computer - generated data of putative ground state energies @xmath2 for various @xmath1-body systems to the above tests has yielded several dozen instances of @xmath3 which failed one of these tests ; i.e. , for those @xmath1 we conclude that @xmath4 strictly , and we get an improved empirical upper bound on @xmath5 through ( [ upperboundegn ] ) .",
    "the surveyed @xmath1-body systems are @xmath1 point charges with @xmath38-dimensional coulomb pair interactions ( @xmath39 ) , placed either on the unit 2-sphere or on a 2-torus ( variably known as ( elliptic ) fekete , thomson , and riesz problems ) .",
    "the analysis of the sphere data is reported in the next section ; for the torus data see section 3 .",
    "-.3truecm finding the minimum energy configuration(s ) of @xmath1 point charges placed on the unit 2 sphere @xmath40 is a beautiful , intriguingly rich , and hard mathematical problem which in addition is relevant to many fields of science ; see the survey articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and the website @xcite .",
    "one can either interpret @xmath40 as a two - dimensional `` physical space '' in its own right with @xmath41 given by the @xmath42-dimensional coulomb pair interaction @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the cordal distance on @xmath40 ; incidentally , the cordal distance on @xmath40 coincides with the three - dimensional euclidean distance between two points @xmath45 and @xmath46 on @xmath47 , but the embedding can be avoided in the discussion . or , one can interpret @xmath48 for @xmath49 as a proper submanifold , with @xmath41 given by the @xmath38-dimensional coulomb pair interaction @xmath50 , where @xmath44 is the @xmath38-dimensional euclidean distance between two points @xmath45 and @xmath46 on @xmath48 . for small @xmath1 the ground state configuration ( a.k.a .",
    "an @xmath1-tuple of fekete points ) can easily be characterized explicitly , the first dozen minimizers are discussed in the delightful article @xcite . ] and the asymptotic large @xmath1-dependence of @xmath5 can be , and to some extent has been @xcite determined analytically without seeking the exact fekete points , the voronoi cells around the charges are mostly hexagons of a certain size ; see @xcite for an enlightening discussion .",
    "we also remark that the leading order term in the asymptotics can be determined with the help of a very general variational principle , see @xcite . ] but in general the problem defies analytical treatment .",
    "computer experiments ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) help finding candidates for the minimizing configuration and in any event yield empirical upper bounds @xmath3 on the ground state energy @xmath5 . but even computers are soon overwhelmed because the number of local minimum energy configurations which are not global seems to grow exponentially with @xmath1 @xcite so that a computer algorithm is more and more likely to find one of these non - global minima .",
    "indeed , our tests have successfully detected a couple dozen non - global minimum energy values because their pair - specific value surpassed an ensuing empirical pair - specific energy value in some computer - generated list .",
    "tables of computer - experimental ground state energies @xmath51 for @xmath1 point charges on @xmath40 with two - dimensional coulomb pair interaction @xmath52 can be found on the website @xcite , more precisely :    http://physics.syr.edu/condensedmatter/thomson/shells/ ...    ... shelltable.php?topology=sphere&potential=0&start=0&end=5000 ,    and in @xcite , which contains many references to earlier studies .",
    "a value of @xmath3 is listed in @xcite for 199 consecutive values of @xmath1 starting at @xmath53 ; one also finds there three additional @xmath3 values for @xmath1 which correspond to the icosahedral group . on p.116 of their article ,",
    "the authors describe various careful tests which they have undertaken to increase the chances of their @xmath3 actually being @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to their tests i now have subjected their list of data @xmath54 to the @xmath55 monotonicity test ( which , apparently , is not among the tests which the authors of @xcite have used ) .",
    "their data passed the @xmath55 test ( there is no point , then , to test with @xmath56 ) .    while all tables in @xcite are of course permanent , those at @xcite , according to these authors , are interactive and are updated whenever some user finds a new and better pair @xmath57 .",
    "therefore it is mandatory to also give the information on which day one downloaded the data from @xcite for study , which for the computer - experimental data on the @xmath42 coulomb ground state energies i did on feb .",
    "21 , 2009 ; yet , on feb .",
    "24 , 2009 the crucial data i will be talking about below were still the same . at the time of writing of this paper , this data list @xmath58 has ( had ) plenty of gaps , i.e. putative ground state energies @xmath3 are absent for many values of @xmath1 . while the absence of the case @xmath53 is not a problem , as @xmath59 is exactly known ,",
    "the first real gap is the absence of any @xmath60 , any @xmath61 , and soon the gaps become larger and larger .",
    "the larger the gaps , the less likely one is to detect non - globally minimizing @xmath3 with the monotonicity tests , yet two data points `` got caught in this net '' : @xmath62 , for @xmath63 ; and @xmath64 , for @xmath65 .",
    "notice that while there is only a gap of 2 missing data between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the gap between @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a whopping 2211 .",
    "since the non - globally minimizing @xmath68 was detected by the @xmath70 test , it must be quite far away from the actual ground state energy @xmath71 . by ( [ upperboundegn ] ) , and using @xmath72 from @xcite , we find the upper bound , @xmath73 similarly , with @xmath74 from @xcite , ( [ upperboundegn ] ) with @xmath75 yields @xmath76 ; however , this upper bound is certainly beaten by @xmath77 in @xcite .",
    "incidentally , several other non - globally minimizing data @xmath3 in the list at @xcite which actually pass the monotonicity tests can be detected by simply comparing with the list in @xcite ( at the time of writing , the non - global data at @xcite are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath67 ) ; yet , no such comparison is possible for @xmath68 as the data reported in @xcite do not go beyond @xmath83 .",
    "we end this subsection with an illustration of the monotonicity of the sequence @xmath27 by plotting the monotonically increasing sequence @xmath84 using the data in @xcite , with `` @xmath85 '' for @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "= 13.5 cm = 4.5 cm    already for @xmath87 this empirical curve seems to agree to within less than @xmath88 absolute error with the large @xmath1 asymptotics of the actual sequence @xmath15 , given by @xmath89 and obtained through dividing by @xmath90 the large-@xmath1 asymptotic formula for @xmath91 @xcite , @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "in @xcite it is also conjectured that , actually , @xmath95 and rigorous upper and lower bounds on @xmath96 are given there .",
    "@xmath97 problem for the 21@xmath98 century asks for an algorithm which upon input @xmath1 returns an @xmath1-point configuration on @xmath40 for which @xmath3 does not deviate from @xmath5 by more than the fourth term in the conjectured expansion ( [ asympconjlogs2 ] ) ( possibly up to a different coefficient @xmath99 ) , and which does so in polynomial time ; see @xcite .",
    "we next discuss the data for @xmath1 point charges on the sphere @xmath40 with three - dimensional coulomb interactions @xmath100 , since @xcite referred to as `` thomson s problem '' even though thomson s `` plum pudding model of the atom '' @xcite is not quite the same problem . be that as it may , there seem to be many more studies of this thomson problem than of its variants with other pair interactions and geometries .",
    "i perused a sample of those studies and eventually found data which failed a monotonicity test .",
    "starting at @xmath53 , in @xcite one finds 111 , and in @xcite 199 consecutively computed putative ground state energies @xmath3 for the thomson problem ( as just defined ) . since the authors in @xcite mention that within numerical precision their data agree with those on sloan s home page @xcite ( actually , at the time : its predecessor via netlib.att.com ) , i opted for analyzing the data on @xcite which are stored ( much ) more userfriendly than those in @xcite and @xcite , even though for only 129 consecutive values of @xmath1 some value @xmath3 is listed , starting with @xmath101 , plus a handful of other values for @xmath1s up to @xmath83 .",
    "all data at @xcite passed the @xmath55 monotonicity test .",
    "a wonderful treasure of data for the thomson problem is listed on the website @xcite , more precisely :    http://physics.syr.edu/condensedmatter/thomson/shells/ ...    ... shelltable.php?topology=sphere&potential=1&start=0&end=5000 .",
    "i downloaded the data on feb.09 , 2009 , and on feb.24 the relevant data were still present .",
    "starting with @xmath102 , one finds computer - experimental ground state energies @xmath3 for an amazing 1488 consecutive values of @xmath1 , the first gap occurring at @xmath103 .",
    "in addition one finds almost 300 wider spaced @xmath3 up to @xmath104 .",
    "quite remarkably , all the consecutive values up to @xmath105 passed the monotonicity test , and so did an additional 70 values of @xmath3 which are listed with gaps up to @xmath106 .",
    "the computer - experimental @xmath107 is the first in the list which failed a monotonicity test , in fact the @xmath55 test , with @xmath108 .",
    "of course , there is also a better upper bound on @xmath109 via ( [ upperboundegn ] ) , but it is not much of an improvement .",
    "the story is quite different for the next failling , which is @xmath110 , which failed the 10@xmath111 and the 20@xmath111 monotonicity tests , with @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this time we obtain two upper bounds from ( [ upperboundegn ] ) ( for @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) , and the better one is for @xmath114 , viz .",
    "@xmath116 which is also a considerable improvement over the listed @xmath117 .",
    "not surprisingly , in this long list of computer - experimental data our harvest is richer than in the previous log list .",
    "an additional nine valus of @xmath3 failed one or more of the monotonicity tests ( indicated by @xmath118 behind @xmath3 ) , namely    @xmath119    @xmath120    @xmath121    @xmath122    @xmath123    @xmath124    @xmath125    @xmath126    @xmath127 .    we leave it to the interested reader to use ( [ upperboundegn ] ) to compute upper bounds on @xmath5 for the @xmath1 showing in this table and the pertinent @xmath128 at @xcite .    all the data in @xcite",
    "pass the monotonicity test , but these data are few and far between so that it is actually quite unlikely for any of them to fail a monotonicity test .",
    "in fact , @xcite in their table list only five different @xmath129 ( ! ) , with two different @xmath3 each ; @xcite point out that they found a lower energy @xmath130 than did @xcite .",
    "also @xcite provided a putative value for @xmath131 , and their @xmath132 is even lower than the one in @xcite , which is @xmath133 .",
    "incidentally , there is also a moral here , to be told in the last section .    to illustrate the monotonicity of the sequence @xmath27 i plot the monotonically increasing sequence @xmath84 , this time using the data in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath86 also these two sequences are identical @xcite .",

    "for the perhaps most prominent non - spherical topology , the 2-torus @xmath140 , we found data lists at @xcite .",
    "however , these lists are clearly preliminary .",
    "curiously , at @xcite putative ground state energies @xmath3 are only listed for four different values of @xmath1 , and all of them are obtained with different aspect ratios of the tori .",
    "hence , no meaningful monotonicity test can be applied .",
    "a visualization of a putative ground state configuration of @xmath1 point charges with logarithmic coulomb interactions on a 2-torus can be found in @xcite and on the cover of that issue of the notices , and also at @xcite .      at",
    "@xcite one finds about 50 data of putative ground state energies @xmath3 for the aspect ratio @xmath141 , which are computed for sparcely placed @xmath1 up to @xmath104 . for sparsely placed data one would expect it to be less likely to find some which fail a monotonicity test . however , the data @xmath3 for nine @xmath1 failed a monotonicity test for one or more @xmath32 , namely :    @xmath142    @xmath143    @xmath144    @xmath145    @xmath146    @xmath147    @xmath148    @xmath149    @xmath150 .",
    "again , we leave it to the interested reader to use ( [ upperboundegn ] ) and the above table to compute upper bounds on @xmath5 from the pertinent data list at @xcite .",
    "two- and three - dimensional coulomb pair interactions and 2-sphere and 2-torus domains are merely the most prominent examples of pair interactions @xmath151 and @xmath152-dimensional domains @xmath153 to which proposition [ prop : upernsqminusn ] applies .",
    "other , though physically less important , examples of interactions are @xmath38-dimensional coulomb interactions with @xmath154 , and more generally the so - called riesz interactions , computed with @xmath155 , for any real @xmath156 ; see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic coulomb interaction is usually considered to be the special case @xmath157 , in the sense that @xmath158 ; for @xmath159 the riesz energy gives @xmath160 , in which case proposition [ prop : upernsqminusn ] may shed some new light on the question of the maximum average pair - wise distance of points in @xmath153 and related problems ; beside the cited general survey articles , also see @xcite .",
    "proposition [ prop : upernsqminusn ] applies also to other bounded domains , in particular curves !",
    "i should emphasize that the logarithmic interactions between charges constrained to ( planar ) curves can be studied in quite some detail with complex variable techniques , see @xcite .",
    "proposition [ prop : upernsqminusn ] can easily be generalized to unbounded domains , with lower semi - continuity replaced by another appropriate condition guaranteeing minimizing configurations for all @xmath1 .",
    "a physically important example is @xmath161 with @xmath162 , which has minimizing @xmath1-body configurations for each @xmath1 , known as lennard - jones clusters , see @xcite for a recent survey . at the expense of replacing the minimum by an infimum , pair interactions which are merely bounded below",
    "can be handled also , but minimizing sequences which do nt converge to a minimizing configuration are perhaps less interesting .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to draw attention to the monotonicity tests implied by proposition [ prop : upernsqminusn ] and to emphasize the ups and downs of this monotonicity test family , not to report on an exhaustive series of such tests covering all available data .",
    "in fact , having demonstrated the utility of these tests , it is much more efficient when they are being directly implemented in the computer experiments rather than being run by a third person afterwards .",
    "i still owe the reader the moral announced earlier .",
    "originally i had analyzed the data of computer - experimental ground state energies @xmath3 reported in @xcite which , divided by @xmath90 , arranged themselves monotonically increasing when plotted vs. @xmath1 ; in fact , this prompted me to conjecture and then prove proposition [ prop : upernsqminusn ] .",
    "but , as we saw , those data are not the correct ground state energies .",
    "with hindsight i was quite lucky , for such widely spaced data almost inevitably form a pair - specific monotonic sequence .",
    "had i hit upon a more closely spaced list of non - optimal data which would not have been pair - specifically monotonic , i may not have conjectured the monotonicity in the first place !",
