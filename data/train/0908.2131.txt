    "it is of great interest to understand the low - energy behavior of asymptotically free gauge theories .",
    "analyzing such theories in the strong - coupling regime is generally quite difficult , but can become tractable with a sufficient amount of symmetry .",
    "strongly - coupled gauge theories with @xmath0 supersymmetry are particularly interesting in that they are both amenable to analysis and potentially relevant for phenomenology .",
    "possible applications include dynamical supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , conformal sequestering  @xcite , dynamical solutions to the @xmath7-problem  @xcite , dynamical explanations of the flavor hierarchies  @xcite , dynamical solutions to the doublet - triplet splitting problem  @xcite , and so on .",
    "when analyzing a supersymmetric gauge theory , a first - order question is to determine what kind of phase the theory flows to at low energies .",
    "possibilities include that the theory is infrared ( ir ) free , the theory flows to an interacting conformal ( non - abelian coulomb ) phase , the theory has a dual description that is ir free , the theory confines , the theory dynamically generates a superpotential that breaks the gauge group , or that the theory enters a pure abelian coulomb phase ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "in addition , it is possible that the theory enters a mixed phase consisting of decoupled sectors that are in some combination of the above phases .",
    "this can occur , e.g. , when the theory is in an interacting conformal regime but some set of operators have become free fields and decoupled from the cft .",
    "more exotically , the theory could have a dual description containing a product gauge group in which one gauge group is interacting and one gauge group is ir free .",
    "this was argued to occur , e.g. , in @xmath8 gauge theories with an anti - symmetric tensor  @xcite .    an important tool for studying theories in a conformal regime , a - maximization ,",
    "was introduced by intriligator and wecht in  @xcite , and further developed in  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the correct superconformal @xmath9 symmetry can be determined by maximizing a(r_t ) = over all possible trial r - symmetries @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is any initial r - symmetry and @xmath12 are the ir flavor symmetries .",
    "this is an extremely powerful technique provided that one understands the ir flavor symmetries .",
    "unfortunately , one can not always identify the ir flavor symmetries as a subset of the uv flavor symmetries ",
    "accidental symmetries can arise ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a number of interesting examples ) .",
    "how can one gain evidence for accidental symmetries ?",
    "one way is to check whether there are any gauge - invariant operators in the chiral ring of the theory that violate the unitarity bound , given by @xmath13 for scalar operators  @xcite . if this bound appears to be violated , then one plausible interpretation is that @xmath14 is becoming a free field with @xmath15 . in this case",
    "there is an accidental symmetry associated with rotations of @xmath14 , and one must include this symmetry when maximizing @xmath16 . in practice , this requires one to instead maximize  @xcite ( r_t ) = a(r_t ) + ( 2 - 3 r_)^2(5 - 3 r _ ) .    however , not all accidental symmetries manifest themselves through apparent violations of unitarity .",
    "this happens for example in @xmath8 gauge theories with @xmath3 flavors of vector - like quarks @xmath17 in the range @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "since the anomaly - free @xmath9 symmetry is @xmath19 , the mesons @xmath20 appear to violate the unitarity bound in this range and presumably become free fields",
    ". however , this is only part of the story , as it is also believed that the entire dual @xmath21 gauge group and the corresponding dual quarks are also becoming free fields , yielding many more accidental symmetries .",
    "this is not obvious in the original electric description of the theory , but becomes apparent when the dual magnetic description is analyzed .",
    "when studying similar theories , it is clearly of great interest to have dual descriptions available that can be studied , as they may contain evidence for the emergence of non - obvious accidental ir symmetries .    in the present work we will use a - maximization to study @xmath22 supersymmetric @xmath6 gauge theory with @xmath23 fundamentals @xmath24 and an adjoint @xmath25 .",
    "while the theory with superpotential @xmath26 is fairly well understood  @xcite , the theory with vanishing superpotential has not been as easy to analyze .",
    "an attempt to study this theory using deconfinement  @xcite was made in  @xcite , where it was proposed that the theory has a sequence of dual descriptions , the first of which is based on an @xmath27 gauge theory . however , because the @xmath9 symmetry of the theory was unknown it was not possible to determine which operators , if any , gave apparent violations of the unitarity bound as one varies @xmath3 and @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , it was not possible to explicitly check the dual descriptions for evidence of additional accidental symmetries , as would occur if either of the dual gauge groups were becoming free .",
    "as we will see , such an analysis is now possible using a - maximization , and we will here present an attempt to map out the phase structure of the theory .",
    "similar studies of other theories have appeared in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sp2n ] we use a - maximization to study @xmath6 gauge theory with an adjoint . in sections  [ sec : dual ] and  [ sec : seconddual ] we perform a similar analysis of the first two dual descriptions of the theory , comparing the results and looking for evidence of accidental ir symmetries .",
    "we give concluding remarks in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we are interested in studying @xmath22 supersymmetric @xmath29 gauge theory . ] with @xmath2 fundamentals @xmath24 and an adjoint @xmath25 .",
    "the field content and anomaly - free symmetries are given in table  [ fields ] .",
    ".field content of the theory .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can again begin by assuming that each of the @xmath30 gauge groups are interacting and that the entire superpotential in eq .  [ seconddualw ] is marginal .",
    "this gives 3 constraints from anomaly cancellation and 11 constraints from the superpotential on 15 unknown r - charges , causing @xmath31 to again be a function of a single variable ( as expected ) .",
    "the r - charges of each field are then easily obtained in terms of @xmath32 by considering the linear combination [ rchargesseconddual ] r_i[r_a_2 ] = r_i - x_i r_a_2,where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the @xmath35 and @xmath36 charges given in table  [ fieldsseconddual ] .",
    "alternatively , this parametrization could be obtained by using the 14 constraints to solve for the 15 unknown r - charges in terms @xmath32 , as we did in the previous section .",
    "it is then straightforward to verify that the function a^dual_2(r_a_2 ) & = & is exactly equal to the functions given in eqs .",
    "( [ afunction ] ) and  ( [ dualfunction ] ) .",
    "in particular , maximizing it gives rise to the same @xmath9 symmetry as was found in the previous sections .",
    "furthermore , the operators @xmath37 become free fields at the same thresholds as before as we lower @xmath3 from @xmath38 .",
    "appears to badly violate the unitarity bound , since it has @xmath39 .",
    "however , if the duality is to be believed , non - perturbative effects in this description should cause this operator to be zero in the chiral ring in order to avoid a contradiction . ]    when the operator @xmath40 hits the unitarity bound we assume that the coupling @xmath41 is simply flowing to zero so that @xmath40 can become a free field .",
    "note that this is unlikely be the result of the @xmath42 gauge coupling flowing to zero because this would also force @xmath43 to be a free field and one would expect that @xmath44 close to this threshold , which is not the case .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath45 gauge group going free would not cause this operator to become irrelevant .",
    "thus we first consider the possibility that , similar to the hypothetical mixed phase considered in the previous section , the @xmath46 gauge group is becoming free when @xmath40 hits the unitarity bound .",
    "if this is the case , unitarity requires that @xmath47 and forces the couplings @xmath48 and @xmath49 to become irrelevant .",
    "the interacting superpotential of the mixed phase then becomes [ wmixedsecdual ] w_mixed & = & ( _ 1 _ 2)(_1 _ 2)+ n_1 _ 1 _ 1 + a_2 _ 2 _ 2 + m_1 _ 1 _ 1 + & & + n_3 _ 2 _ 2 + n_2 _ 2 _ 1 + n_4 _ 1 _ 2 + n_5 _ 1 _ 2 , along with the free fields @xmath50 and potentially free operators @xmath51 .",
    "the superpotential combined with anomaly cancellation then give 10 constraints on 11 unknown r - charges , with the same parametrization for the r - charges of the interacting fields as in eq .",
    "[ rchargesseconddual ] .",
    "however , again we can rewrite the condition that @xmath52 < 0 $ ] as [ ra2bound ] r_a_2 < - ( ) , and this scenario is disfavored for the same reason as in first dual .",
    "it is straightforward to additionally verify that no subset of the couplings in eq .",
    "[ wmixedsecdual ] lead to an ir attractive fixed point .",
    "next we would like to investigate the possibility that when @xmath43 becomes a free field the @xmath42 gauge coupling is flowing to zero .",
    "note that in this case unitarity is forcing the @xmath53 coupling to become irrelevant . to see",
    "if this is plausible we can again attempt to determine the @xmath9 symmetry of the hypothetical mixed phase and check the sign of the @xmath42 @xmath54-function .",
    "if it is correct that the @xmath42 gauge coupling flows to zero , unitarity also requires that @xmath55 in addition to @xmath56 .",
    "these conditions imply that the couplings @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 should become irrelevant , and thus it is reasonable to assume that the interacting superpotential becomes [ seconddualwmixed ] w_mixed & = & ( _ 1 _ 2)(_1 _ 2 ) + n_1 _ 2 ^ 2 p_3 + n_1 _ 1 _ 1 + a_2 _ 2 _ 2 + n_2 _ 2 _ 1 + n_4 _ 1 _ 2 , along with the free fields @xmath60 and potentially free operators @xmath61 .",
    "since we now have 8 constraints and 10 unknown r - charges , @xmath62 will be a function of 2 variables and is best maximized numerically . doing this , however , we find that the function has no stable maximum and thus the fixed point does not exist .",
    "if we turn off one additional coupling , we find that the only ir stable choice is to assume that @xmath63 is flowing to zero  i.e. , only this operator has @xmath64 in the hypothetical cft in which it is absent from the superpotential .",
    "however , in this case one can then check that @xmath65 > 0 $ ] for all @xmath28 and @xmath3 , and hence the assumption that @xmath66 is not correct . to illustrate this , in figure  [ traceplot ] we plot",
    "@xmath67 $ ] as a function of @xmath3 in the limit of large @xmath28 .",
    "we have also checked that no subset of these couplings leads to an ir stable fixed point .",
    "we thus do not find any evidence for a mixed phase in this description of the theory .",
    "[ traceplot ]    $ ] as a function of @xmath3 in the large @xmath28 limit of the hypothetical mixed phase .",
    "because it is always positive the @xmath42 gauge coupling can not flow to zero and the mixed phase does not exist . ]",
    "in this work we have attempted to map out the phase structure of supersymmetric @xmath6 gauge theories with @xmath2 fundamentals , an adjoint , and vanishing superpotential .",
    "the ir behavior of this theory has an incredibly rich structure and has previously been difficult to analyze . using a - maximization , however ,",
    "we have been able to check the conjectures of  @xcite as well as look for evidence that the theory enters a mixed phase below some value of @xmath3 .",
    "we have not found any such evidence in the simplest known dual descriptions of the theory .",
    "it is thus tempting to believe ( though far from proven ) that the original electric description of the theory is a good description for all @xmath28 and @xmath3 .",
    "a straightforward extension of the present work would be to construct the deconfined dual descriptions of the @xmath8 version of this theory and perform a similar analysis .",
    "it would also be quite interesting to find dual descriptions of these theories in which the operators @xmath68 appear as elementary fields so that one could better understand the way in which they decouple from the theory .",
    "more generally , it would be interesting to find new examples of theories that possess mixed phases ( as in  @xcite ) so that one could better understand and classify the situations under which they can occur .",
    "these possible directions are left to future work .",
