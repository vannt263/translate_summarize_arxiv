    "the pioneer anomaly@xcite ( pa ) consists of an unmodelled almost constant and uniform acceleration approximately directed towards the sun of magnitude = ( 8.741.33)10 ^ -10  2detected@xcite in the radiometric data from the pioneer 10 ( launched in march 1972 ) and pioneer 11 ( launched in april 1973 ) spacecraft after they passed the @xmath4 20 au threshold moving with speed @xmath5 along roughly antiparallel escape hyperbolic paths undertaken after their previous encounters with jupiter ( @xmath6 au ) and saturn ( @xmath7 au ) , respectively .",
    "concerning the possibility that pa started to manifest itself at shorter heliocentric distances@xcite , efforts to retrieve and analyze early data from pioneer 10/11 are currently being performed@xcite .",
    "the pioneer spacecraft were particularly well suited for radioscience celestial mechanics experiments because they were spin - stabilized ; in practice , they could be regarded as gyroscopes so that only a few orientation maneuvers , easily modeled , were needed every year to keep the antenna pointed towards the earth . on the contrary ,",
    "3-axis stabilized spacecraft like voyager 1/2 undergo continuous , semi - autonomous , small gas jet thrusts to maintain the antenna facing the earth ; as a consequence , their navigation is not as precise as that of the pioneer 10/11 .",
    "the attempts performed so far to explain pa in terms of known effects of gravitational@xcite and/or non - gravitational@xcite origin were found to be not satisfactory@xcite , so that a vast number of exotic explanations based on modified models of gravity were proposed ( see , e.g. , , and references therein ) .",
    "if pa is due to some modifications of the known laws of gravity , this must be due to a radial extra - force affecting the orbits of the planets as well , especially those moving in the region in which pa manifested itself in its presently known form .",
    "the impact of a pioneer - like additional acceleration on the motion of major and minor bodies in the outer regions of the solar system was recently studied by numerous authors with different approaches@xcite : it turned out that a constant and uniform extra - acceleration with the magnitude of would produce huge secular effects which are neatly absent in the planetary data .",
    "it was recently suggested@xcite that , from a purely phenomenological point of view , test bodies moving in the ( outer ) solar system could experience velocity - dependent extra - accelerations of the form a_v=-|v_r| ( ) , a_v =- v_r ( ) , and  a_v^2=-v_r^2 ( ) ,  a_v^2=-|v_r|v_r ( ) where @xmath8 is the radial component of the test particle s velocity @xmath9 ; and would reduce to for the pioneer 10/11 spacecraft whose velocities can be assumed entirely radial in the outer regions of the solar system in which pa was detected .",
    "standish in put on the test such a hypothesis by fitting huge planetary data sets with the dynamical force models of the latest jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) de ephemerides modified @xmath10 according to and and examining the results in terms , e.g , of the reliability of the estimated parameters .",
    "his conclusion was that the existence of extra - accelerations like those of and at heliocentric distances @xmath11 au can not be ruled out by the present - day available data of the outer planets because and , especially , would induce orbital effects on them too small to be detected .",
    "their existence in the inner regions of solar system is , instead , ruled out .    in this paper we will follow a different approach by using the epm2006 ephemerides produced by e.v .",
    "pitjeva@xcite at the institute of applied astronomy ( iaa ) of the russian academy of sciences ( ras ) .",
    "first , we will analytically work out the secular effects of small perturbing accelerations like those of and on the keplerian orbital elements of a planet in order to gain as clear as possible insights about the modifications which the orbits would undergo if and were real ; should some implausible physical feature turn out , it would be more difficult to trust such proposed anomalous forces .",
    "then , we will compare some of such predictions with the latest observational determinations for the outer planets estimated by pitjeva with the epm2006 ephemerides in a purely phemomenological way as corrections to the known effects due to usual newton - einstein laws , without modelling any additional force . in table",
    "[ pittable ] we quote some quantities we will use .",
    "they are the outcome of a global fit of more than 400,000 data points ( 1913 - 2006 ) performed by pitjeva@xcite with the epm2006 ephemerides ; about 230 parameters were estimated .    it must be noted that the uncertainties @xmath12 in the estimated corrections to the perihelion precessions are the formal ones re - scaled by a factor 10 in order to obtain realistic evaluations for them .",
    "according to the classification of , the first two kinds of extra - forces are linear in @xmath8 being a_v^(2 ) = -|v_r|,a_v^(3 ) = -v_r , with = = 7.310 ^ -14  rad  s^-1 = 47.4  arcsec  cy^-1.the radial acceleration of is constantly inward , i.e. directed towards the sun , while the one of is directed towards the sun when @xmath13 , i.e. when the planets gets farther from the sun , while is directed away the sun when @xmath14 , i.e. when the planet gets closer to the sun . indeed , for an unperturbed keplerian ellipse@xcite v_r = = , where @xmath1 is the semimajor axis",
    ", @xmath2 is the eccentricity , @xmath15 is the mean motion , @xmath16 is the true anomaly counted anticlockwise from the perihelion , and @xmath17 is the eccentric anomaly .",
    "@xmath13 for @xmath18 , i.e. , from the perihelion to the aphelion , and @xmath14 for @xmath19 , i.e. from the aphelion back to the perihelion .    in view of the smallness of and for the planets of the solar system",
    ", we will treat them perturbatively .",
    "indeed , the radial velocities for the outer planets amount to @xmath20 m s@xmath21 only , so that @xmath22 m s@xmath23 , while the newtonian attraction of the sun is for them of the order of @xmath24 m s@xmath23 .",
    "let us work out the secular precession of the longitude of perihelion @xmath0 .",
    "the gauss equation for its variation due to an entirely radial perturbing acceleration @xmath25 is@xcite t = -a_rf.by inserting into , evaluating the r.h.s over the unperturbed keplerian ellipse characterized by @xmath26 and averaging over one orbital period one gets = - < 0.we have used the fact that |v_r| = v_r ,  0f ;  |v_r| = -v_r ,  f 2 .    instead , yields no perihelion precession .",
    "indeed , = -_0 ^ 2de = 0 .",
    "the gauss equation for the variation of the semimajor axis due to the a radial perturbing acceleration is@xcite a t = a_rf.by proceeding as before it turns out that does not yield secular variations of @xmath1 ; instead , induces a secular decrease of @xmath1 according to a= 2a(-1).note that for circular orbits , i.e. @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "since e t = ( ) a twhen @xmath29 , also the eccentricity decreases : e= ( -1).as expected for a central force , the orbital angular momentum @xmath30 is conserved , on average : indeed , and yield t= gm= 0.instead , the energy @xmath31 is not conserved ; according to , = a= ( -1 ) < 0.such a result is certainly suspect from a physical point of view .    in order to independently check the results obtained analytically we performed two numerical integrations of the equations of motion adding to the newtonian monopole term the perturbing accelerations of and :",
    "the qualitative features of the resulting motions are depicted in figure [ figtype2 ] and figure [ figtype3 ] .",
    "let us now consider the problem of the existence of the accelerations of and from a phenomenological point of view according to the present - day planetary data available . in table",
    "[ tavola23 ] we quote the predictions for the outer planets of the centennial shifts in m of the semimajor axis , according to , and of the secular perihelion precessions in arcsec cy@xmath21 , according to .    such predictions must be compared with the observationally determined parameters quoted in table [ pittable ] .",
    "concerning the semimajor axis , the present - day accuracy in determining them would clearly allow to detect shifts as large as those of table [ tavola23 ] for all planets from jupiter to pluto with the exception of neptune , even by re - scaling the values of @xmath32 of table [ pittable ] by a factor 10 or more .",
    "the situation is less neat for the perihelion precessions .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the present - day accuracy in determining them does not allow to rule out , with exception of jupiter .",
    "thus , we conclude that the acceleration of proportional to @xmath33 is to be considered ruled out by observations ; it is true that , in principle , adjusting the ephemerides ( without modifying their dynamical force models as done with epm2006 ) may absorb the exotic signatures , but we do not believe that could occur because of the huge size of them . instead , the effects induced by , proportional to @xmath34 , are still compatible with data . of course , in drawing such conclusions we are tacitly assuming that the pioneer - type anomalous accelerations of and exist since one century at least .",
    "let us assume that they act since much longer time , say 500 myr ; and tell us that , in this case , 500 myr ago the semimajor axes of the outer planets were equal to 19 au ( jupiter ) , 44 au ( saturn ) , 68 au ( uranus ) , 32 au ( neptune ) and 2,983 au ( pluto ) .",
    "we have used the simple formula a_0 = a -at , in which @xmath35 represents the semimajor axis in the past while @xmath1 denotes its current value .",
    "concerning the eccentricities , they would have been larger than 1 according to and @xmath36 . with regard to the future evolution of the orbits of the outer planets ,",
    "the time required to circularize their orbits with respect to the present - day values of the eccentricities is of the order of @xmath37 yr , provided that the pioneer - type forces considered here will continuously act upon the planets for a so long time span . of course",
    ", issues concerning a theoretical justification for and remain : suffices it to say that they are not , in general , lorentz - invariant , as can be straightforwardly shown by using ^ = ( r -v t ) + ( -1 ) ,  t^ = ( t - ) , ^ = , with @xmath38 .",
    "the conclusions by standish@xcite are that and can not exist for planets up to jupiter and saturn , while their existence at heliocentric distances @xmath11 au is virtually undetectable from the motion of uranus , neptune and pluto .",
    "the other two anomalous radial accelerations examined in , quadratic in the radial velocity , are a_v^2^(4 ) = -v_r^2,a_v^2^(5 ) = -|v_r|v_r , with = = 6.0710 ^ -18  m^-1.the acceleration of is always directed towards the sun , while the one of is inward when the planet moves away from the sun , while it is directed outwards when the planet approaches the sun , as in the case of .",
    "an acceleration like was theoretically obtained by jaekel and reynaud in the framework of their linear@xcite and non - linear@xcite metric extensions of general relativity .",
    "its orbital effects were worked out in : neither the semimajor axis nor the eccentricity undergo secular variations , while the longitude of perihelion precesses according to = ( -2 + e^2 + 2 ) < 0.in figure [ figtype4 ] we show the results of the numerical integration of the equations of motion with added to the newtonian monopole : the results obtained analytically in are confirmed .    in it",
    "was shown that the inner planets perihelion precessions predicted by are neatly ruled out by the corrections to the perihelion precessions estimated by pitjeva@xcite with the epm2004 ephemerides . in table",
    "[ neo ] we quote the predictions for the outer planets ;    it turns out that they are compatible with the results of table [ pittable ] , apart from jupiter .",
    "note that it is true also by considering the formal uncertainties in the estimated corrections to the perihelion precessions , i.e. the values of @xmath12 in table [ pittable ] reduced by 10 times .",
    "such a conclusion substantially agrees with that by standish@xcite .    , contrary to , induces no secular perihelion precession and a secular variation of the semimajor axis and the eccentricity which decrease according to a= , e= .note that @xmath28 for circular orbits .",
    "thus , also does not conserve the total energy .",
    "such analytical results are confirmed by a numerical integration of the equations of motion showed in figure [ figtype5 ] .    in table",
    "[ tavola5 ] we quote the predictions for the centennial semimajor shifts according to .",
    "a comparison with the table [ pittable ] shows that the formal uncertainties @xmath32 are always quite smaller than such anomalous shifts , apart from neptune .",
    "however , it must taken into account that realistic errors may be up to one order of magnitude larger : if so , it would not be possible to rule out the results of table [ tavola5 ] , apart from jupiter . in this case",
    ", our conclusions would agree with those by standish@xcite .",
    "of course , serious issues concerning theoretical justifications of and the temporal extent of its existence remain open .",
    "indeed , given the present - day values of the planetary semimajor axes and eccentricities and assuming that existed unchanged in the deep past , about 100 myr-1gyr ago @xmath39 for the planets from jupiter to pluto .",
    "since , instead , the semimajor axes would have remained almost unchanged , this means that the perihelion distances vanished .",
    "an ingenious attempt recently proposed to explain the pioneer anomaly as due to a modification of the usual newton - einstein laws of gravitation consists in postulating the existence of some velocity - dependent extra - forces linear or quadratic in the radial component @xmath8 of the velocity of a test body .",
    "we put on the test such empirical models in the outer regions of the solar system in which the pioneer anomaly manifested itself in its presently known form with the latest observational determinations of the planetary motions obtained by e.v .",
    "pitjeva with the epm2006 ephemerides .",
    "it turns out that the models yielding anomalous perihelion precessions can not yet be ruled out , at least phenomenologically , for heliocentric distances larger than 5 au . on the contrary ,",
    "the models predicting secular variations of the semimajor axis @xmath1 and the eccentricity @xmath2 are much more difficult to be trusted not only because they would violate the conservation of energy but also because the centennial shifts for @xmath1 predicted by them are so large that they should have been detected , given the present - day accuracy in determining such orbital element .",
    "however , it must be considered that sound theoretical justifications for such models must be given .",
