    "a detailed knowledge of gas statistics in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is pivotal for theories of star formation and the stellar initial mass function ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the difficulty in understanding these statistics arises because much of the ism is in a state of _ supersonic turbulence_a highly chaotic tangle of interacting shocks with structure spanning an enormous range in scale .",
    "however , despite a wide range of work on the subject , enabled in large part by the explosive growth in computational power ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , much less is known about the statistical properties of supersonic turbulence in comparison to its subsonic cousin @xcite .",
    "for example , despite some promising results ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we currently lack a well - accepted theory for the velocity power spectrum , similar to the standard kolmogorov phenomenology for subsonic turbulence @xcite .",
    "further , an important aspect of supersonic turbulence theory , which is much less relevant in subsonic turbulence , is the density statistics .",
    "these are crucial for star - formation applications and directly observable in the ism . however , although there are certain well - established results ",
    "most importantly the _ density variance ",
    "mach number relation _ : that the density distribution is approximately log - normal with a variance that increases with mach number @xcite  we lack detailed understanding of many important issues .",
    "for example , the power spectrum of density and its variation with mach number is not well understood @xcite .",
    "further , an important limitation of the density variance - mach number relation is that the density can be quite _ intermittent _ , viz . , it is not distributed log - normally .",
    "this behavior manifests itself in a significant negative skewness in the probability density function ( pdf ) @xcite , enhancing the probability of low density regions while decreasing the probability of high density regions .",
    "the purpose of this work is to propose and examine a simple phenomenological model for the turbulent density field that encompasses all such statistics : the power spectrum , the density pdf and intermittency , and how these vary with turbulent mach number .",
    "it is worth elaborating on the density intermittency mentioned in the previous paragraph : is this important , or simply a formal nuisance to occupy the idle theorist ?",
    "for some applications , in particular those that depend on events that occur regularly ( i.e. , with high probability ) , the answer is probably that intermittency is not important : so long as the density pdf is approximately log - normal near its peak , high - probability events will be well - characterized purely by the variance .",
    "however , many physically interesting properties that one might wish to derive from turbulent pdfs involve rare events , in particular those involving high - density regions . as a simple example",
    ", if we were interested in regions with a factor @xmath3 enhancement in density over the mean at a turbulent mach number @xmath4 ( e.g. , to push the density above the jean s density and enable gravitational collapse ) , the probability of finding such a region could easily be over - estimated by @xmath5 to @xmath6 orders of magnitude by a log - normal model , compared to a more realistic intermittent model with the same variance .",
    "gaining a better understanding of the density pdf can also be motivated by other more fundamental interests .",
    "for instance , averaged over scale @xmath7 , the pdf of the density field _ can not _ be log - normal ( note that @xmath7 could be the grid scale here ) : by predicting a nonzero probability of finding densities greater than the ratio between the box volume and @xmath8 , a log - normal pdf violates mass conservation ( see also @xcite ; hereafter ) .",
    "further , we shall find that the process of understanding the origin of the density intermittency using the properties of shocks leads to various other insights ; for example , the origins of the qualitatively different pdf shapes seen in non - isothermal or magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence .",
    "this work involves an extension of the supersonic density pdf model proposed by to multi - point statistics .",
    "specifically , this involves specifying the properties of the pdf _ as a function of scale _ , viz . , after averaging the density field over scale @xmath7 ( which is some fraction of the box scale @xmath9 ) what is its pdf ? such a model completely specifies the statistical properties of the turbulent density field and contains significantly more information than the 1-point pdf that is usually calculated from numerical studies .",
    "for example , it allows the prediction of the density variance - mach number relation , a similar relation for the intermittency , density power spectra , and structure functions .",
    "further , these predictions are made with just one or two physically motivated free parameters , that are independent of mach number @xmath1 once this is large . extending the discussions in and based on she - leveque intermittency models that have been successful for subsonic turbulence @xcite , the model relies on a simple physical picture in which the density field is made up of a series of shocks covering a wide range of scales down to where the turbulence becomes subsonic .",
    "starting from the box scale , at which the density field is simply constant , the shocks add density variance in the form of discrete multiplicative events , where the size of individual events is related to the physical properties of a shock .",
    "this predicts a strong relationship between the size of individual events  which controls the intermittency and the variance of the density pdf , governed by the range of scales ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) and the mach number .",
    "comparison to various well - known results and trends , as well as our own numerical simulations , illustrates reasonable agreement across a range in mach numbers .",
    "in addition , given the simple physical reasoning used to derive model parameters from isothermal shock properties , we extend the model to more complex and realistic physics ",
    "for example , a non - isothermal gas equation of state , or mhd  explaining various aspects of the density pdfs and why these are different from isothermal turbulence .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : general considerations ] , we outline a few general considerations that will be used to motivate various choices in our model . in sec  [ sec : model ] we explain the model , in particular how the mathematical structure of a ( compound ) log - poisson random process can be related to the properties of individual shocks .",
    "we take particular care here to outline the choices necessary for various parameters , and how these may be motivated or phenomenologically derived from physical properties of the turbulence .",
    "we then outline a variety of predictions of the model  including the density variance ",
    "mach number relation , intermittency predictions , and power spectra  and compare these to numerical simulations .",
    "this comparison involves both previous results and a variety of new simulations using the lagrangian meshless - finite - mass method in the gizmo code @xcite , which we use to directly compute the density pdf as a function of scale .",
    "we also measure the physical size of shock structures , which forms an important part of our argument , in app .",
    "[ app : shock sizes ] .",
    "overall , model predictions seem to match with numerical results up to numerical uncertainties , although more detailed comparisons will be necessary to understand its successes and failures more completely .",
    "we finish with an extension to non - isothermal turbulence ( illustrating reasonable qualitative agreement with the simulations of @xcite ) and a discussion of mhd , before concluding by reiterating the model s main predictions .",
    "before continuing , it seems worth enumerating several general points about supersonic turbulence . while some of these are well known , given that each plays some crucial role in the derivation of our model , it is helpful to clearly explicate these ideas early on in our discussion .    1 .",
    "supersonic turbulence is not scale invariant , except in the infinite mach number limit .",
    "this arises because of the importance of the sonic scale @xmath11 , which is the scale at which @xmath12 ; i.e. , the scale at which the turbulence becomes subsonic . for modest mach numbers common in nature or numerical experiments , the scale separation between @xmath11 and the driving scale is also modest , challenging the relevance of the concept of a supersonic `` inertial range . ''",
    "this feature necessarily leads to some important differences in the theoretical treatment of supersonic turbulence in comparison to subsonic turbulence .",
    "2 .   since density",
    "is effectively defined with reference to a volume ( it is the mass per unit volume ) , the density itself , and its pdf , are naturally defined with reference to an averaging scale .",
    "this density pdf as a function of scale encodes a wide variety of useful statistical information about the density field . by only ever studying the pdf with respect to some arbitrary scale ( usually the grid scale in numerical simulations ) ,",
    "one risks missing important trends or effects , particularly considering that the sonic scale is often close to the grid scale for mach numbers of @xmath13 at currently available numerical resolutions ( see point 1 ) . as an example , in the numerical simulations in this work , we find that the density pdf becomes significantly _ less _ intermittent below @xmath11 , presumably because the density field on subsonic scales involves nearly gaussian fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the density averaged over scale is also relevant for applications , being an important quantity for studying gravitational collapse .",
    "for example , a region is of ( linear ) size @xmath7 is unstable to collapse if @xmath7 is larger than the jean s length @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the average density over @xmath7 , so to understand the statistics of gravitational collapse in a turbulent cloud , we require an understanding of the density pdf as a function of scale .",
    "3 .   a pdf that appears more log - normal",
    "does not necessarily imply that the underlying statistics are closer to gaussian .",
    "instead , the apparent gaussianity of the pdf may be a result of the suppression of low densities compared to the isothermal case .",
    "this point is important for mhd and non - isothermal turbulence .",
    "the assumption that the shock width is equal to the sonic scale  while useful as a phenomenological tool for deriving density variance  mach number relations @xcite  is inconsistent with log - normal density statistics .",
    "in particular , for isothermal shocks with a density contrast @xmath16 , such a model involves _ all _ of the mass being concentrated in a single shock , which leads to an unphysically intermittent density distribution . in our model , we take the shock width to be some small fixed fraction @xmath17 of @xmath11 , and it will transpire that the @xmath17 parameter controls the intermittency .",
    "the success of density variance estimates using @xmath11 as the shock width may then be related to @xmath18 being approximately universal , even in more complex physical situations ( e.g. , mhd ) .",
    "the infinite - mach - number limit is not equivalent to burger s turbulence ( where the pressure term is neglected in the navier - stokes equations ) .",
    "this is because there are always some regions , no matter how large @xmath1 , where the pressure forces becomes important ; see @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the mathematical structure and physical motivation for the density model .",
    "we shall denote the scale over which the density is averaged as @xmath7 , the box scale as @xmath9 , the pdf of the density averaged over scale @xmath7 as @xmath19 , and assume that the volume average of @xmath20 over the whole box is @xmath21 .",
    "start by considering the density averaged over the scale of the box @xmath22 , which by definition is @xmath23 with the pdf @xmath24 .",
    "the model then provides a description of the density pdf averaged over successively smaller subvolumes of the box , @xmath19 , a full knowledge of which effectively provides a full description of the statistical state of the turbulent density field .",
    "this process is described mathematically by a series of @xmath25 steps , each of which decrease the volume over which @xmath26 is averaged by a factor @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 .",
    "the basic idea is that as one makes a jump down in scale from @xmath7 to @xmath29 , there is some probability , scaling with @xmath30 , of an `` event '' that changes the density by @xmath31 .",
    "this event will be related to a shock structure that was previously in the larger volume ( at scale @xmath7 ) being lost from the smaller volume ( at scale @xmath29 ) , thus causing a decrease in density in the volume being considered .",
    "this shock is related to velocity and density structures that vary over scale @xmath7 , since smaller structures can not contribute significantly due to their smaller size , while there are too few larger structures ( since these vary over scales @xmath32 ) .",
    "the size of this `` jump '' decrease in density @xmath31 is related to the proportion of mass that resides in the shock that is lost in the step , and is itself a random variable . assuming that most of the mass in the system is tied up in shocks ,",
    "steps with no event will cause the average density to increase slightly , because the density in the volume that is lost in the step is less than the average density in the system .",
    "we graphically illustrate such a process in fig .  [",
    "fig : lambda jumps ] , showing how in a volume filled with high density shocks , some steps will cause a large decrease in the mass enclosed by the new volume ( i.e. , an event ) , while other steps will not ( no event ) .     can change as @xmath7 decreases , projected into the 2-d plane .",
    "the brightness illustrates the density field , which is dominated by thin shock structures with a large proportion of the total mass . in the hypothetical step in scale from @xmath7 to @xmath29",
    "the difference in volume ( between the squares ) covers a very high density shock region ( upper right ) , implying the average density at scale @xmath29 is _ less _ than that at @xmath7 , since a significant proportion of the mass is lost in the jump . in contrast , in the jump from @xmath29 to @xmath33 , which entails the same proportional volume change , there is not a significant change in density because all high density regions remain inside the new volume at scale @xmath33 . ]",
    "the process we have just described is known mathematically as a _ compound - log - poisson _ random process .",
    "such processes are well characterized and have been particularly successful in phenomenological turbulence intermittency models for velocity structure functions @xcite .",
    "the process occurs in log space because we consider multiplicative changes to the volume and density ( which are additive in log space ) , while it is a poisson process because the probability of an event is proportional to the size of the jump in volume ( with infinitesimally small jumps being considered ) .",
    "if the size of each density jump , @xmath34 , is fixed ( i.e. , if @xmath35 is a number ) , then the resulting distribution will be log - poisson , @xmath36 where the @xmath37 accounts for a mean shift in the distribution ( required to keep @xmath38 ; see below ) .",
    "however , the distribution has the unphysical property of being discrete , since the jump sizes are discrete , and is thus somewhat inconvenient as a model for density .",
    "this issue may be circumvented by postulating that the size of each jump @xmath35 is itself a random variable , with probability distribution @xmath39 .",
    "this leads to a `` compound - log - poisson '' distribution , where `` compound '' refers to the idea that the distribution is formed as a random process of a random variable .",
    "following , we take the jump sizes to be distributed exponentially @xcite , @xmath40 & \\delta \\ln \\rho - \\epsilon<0\\\\ 0 & \\delta \\ln \\rho - \\epsilon>0\\\\ \\end{cases},\\label{eq : step pdf}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the mean jump size and @xmath42 is a constant that is used to ensure @xmath43 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : steppdf ] .",
    "this leads to a convenient form for the pdf that matches density pdfs measured from simulations remarkably well .",
    "can be motivated as the only choice other than a delta - function distribution ( i.e. , a standard log - poisson process ) that leads to a single fractal dimension for the most singular structures @xcite . however , since the system we model is not scale invariant anyway , our motivation for this choice is primarily simplicity  the pdf may be written in a simple closed form without unphysical discrete jumps  and",
    "other choices give similar results . ]",
    "we now derive the pdf of @xmath44 , @xmath45 . that arises from this process . assuming that the parameter @xmath41 does not depend on scale , @xmath45 is the convolution of @xmath46 @xmath47 distributions shifted by the total number of steps @xmath48 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the convolution power and @xmath51 is the gamma distribution . as one takes the limit @xmath52 , @xmath53 with @xmath54 ,",
    "the number of events @xmath46 is itself is a poisson - distributed random variable with mean @xmath55 ( this will depend on scale @xmath7 and is specified below ) , so the full pdf for @xmath44 is simply a sum of the pdfs for a given @xmath46 , weighted by the probability that such an @xmath46 occurs @xmath56 . putting this together ,",
    "one obtains @xmath57,\\label{eq : phils}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the first - order modified bessel function of the first kind , and @xmath60 is nonzero only for @xmath61 .",
    "we may then fix @xmath62 using the constraint @xmath63 , which leads to the density pdf proposed in .",
    "the volume - weighted variance is @xmath64 , while @xmath41the mean size of the jumps  is an intermittency parameter that skews the distribution towards higher probability at @xmath65 . in line with our intuition ,",
    "small numbers of large density jumps ( e.g. , large shocks ) lead to highly intermittent distributions , while a large number of small jumps leads to distributions that are very close to log - normal .",
    "the mass - weighted variance is @xmath66 , so @xmath67 in the @xmath68 ( log - normal ) limit as expected .",
    "also note that , unlike a log - normal pdf , this distribution has a maximum value @xmath69 above which @xmath70 .",
    "this property is entirely physical : the probability of encountering @xmath71 is identically zero , since there is not enough mass in the system .    to relate the mathematical model to the physical properties of supersonic turbulence , we require two extra pieces of information : ( i ) how the average number of events @xmath55 relates to the physical scale @xmath7 , and ( ii ) how the parameter @xmath41 ( the size of an event ) relates to the physical properties of a shock structure .",
    "we tackle these issues in the next two sections .      , where @xmath72 is a small parameter proportional to the size of the step in volume @xmath73 .",
    "the maximum @xmath42 is chosen as @xmath74 , which correctly captures the true maximum of @xmath20 when @xmath75 , and otherwise describes how the maximum density changes with scale . when coupled with the constraint @xmath43 , @xmath76 sets the proportionality between @xmath72 and @xmath77 as @xmath78 . ]    in this section , we relate the average number of events @xmath55 to the physical scale @xmath7 . to explore this , it is helpful to consider the pdf of @xmath35 for a single step , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : steppdf ] .",
    "this is a mixture distribution of @xmath47 with probability @xmath79 ( there is an event ) , and a ( shifted ) @xmath80-function distribution with probability @xmath81 ( there is no event ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 thus determines the mean number of events over a given number of steps , implying the relation between @xmath55 and @xmath7 is controlled by the proportionality constant between @xmath72 and the ( log ) differential change in scale between @xmath7 and @xmath29 , @xmath82 .",
    "the first constraint we can apply to the single - step pdf is that the total mass must conserved , @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 indicates the mean over the single - step pdf ) .",
    "this leads to the constraint @xmath85 the second mass - conservation - related constraint we apply is that the _ maximum _ density scales as @xmath86 ; i.e. , @xmath87 , or @xmath88 this constraint simply states that the increase in density when there is no event is proportional to some power of the change in linear dimension .",
    "if @xmath89 , this implies that _ all _ of the mass from the old volume is contained into the new volume when there is no event , which will give a density pdf with the true ( physical ) density maximum @xmath90 .",
    "however , we find empirically ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : numerics ] ) that @xmath91 predicts a pdf that is insufficiently intermittent , and that @xmath92 provides a closer fit to data , a value @xmath93 fits our intuitive picture of a collection of shocks .",
    "in particular , even in the case when all of the mass is contained in infinitely thin shocks , most of these will be at some angle to the changing volume and thus a `` no event '' step will involve losing a small part of this mass .",
    "for example , if such shocks on average intersect one dimension of the changing volume , this would imply @xmath94 , while if they intersect two it would imply @xmath95 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 is related to the density in unshocked regions , the dimensionality of the shocks , and their distribution in angle . ] ( for the model of @xmath41 proposed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : t discussion ] below ) .",
    "we thus consider @xmath76 to be a parameter of our model , which should be universal for all turbulence with @xmath96 .",
    "note that a deviation from this general form ( i.e. , if @xmath42 was not taken proportional to @xmath97 but chosen through some other method ) would imply that the geometrical properties and distribution of the shocks was a function of scale",

    "`` shocks '' will be taken as regions that are extended across the volume being considered ( i.e. , of size @xmath7 ) in two - dimensions , and be of small but finite extent in the other dimension @xcite .",
    "concentrating for now on the simplest isothermal equation of state , the rankine - hugoniot conditions for mass and momentum conservation of @xmath20 and @xmath100 on either side of a shock are @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the velocity on side @xmath103 in the direction perpendicular to the shock .",

    "[ sec : model ] , as to provide useful models for turbulent pdfs . with this in mind , some of the ideas discussed can likely be applied more rigorously if so desired ; for example , to derive scalings for the low or high density tails of the pdf .",

    "[ fig : pdf scales 1.3](a ) ) . ]    the key idea of the method  which is effectively that proposed in @xcite extended to non - lognormal isothermal pdfs  is to assume that the primary effect of the non - isothermal equation of state is to modify the sound speed with the density .",
    "this in turn modifies the local mach number and causes the shock density contrast to depend on the local value of the density . as shown in @xcite , this behavior",
    "is indeed seen as a correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath1 in the turbulent joint mach number - density pdf , as well as leading to a useful estimate for the modified density variance - mach number relation when applied to the shock - jump condition .",

    "although working this out correctly will certainly change the functional dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath1 , as well as adding @xmath311 dependence into the shock jump size ( @xmath17 or some similar parameter ) , the key differences compared to an isothermal equation of state  in particular the reduction in the size of jumps at low ( high ) density for @xmath312 ( @xmath313) are retained in the much simplified version . ]",

    "finally , we note that similar ideas can be applied to mhd turbulence .",
    "a simple method , used in @xcite for the density variance - mach number relation , is again to consider how the mach number is altered by the influence of the magnetic field on the total pressure , @xmath321 where @xmath322 is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure and @xmath323 is the sound speed without the magnetic field . to apply this form of @xmath1 to the density pdf model",
    ", we need a prescription for how @xmath324 changes with @xmath20 .",
