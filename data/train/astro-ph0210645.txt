    "one of the major thrusts in modern cosmology is an accurate census of star formation and star - forming galaxies in the universe .",
    "this endeavor forms the backbone for a slew of methods ( observational , analytical , and numerical ) to study the process of galaxy formation and evolution over cosmic time . to date",
    ", star - forming galaxies have been selected and studied mainly in two observational windows : the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) , and rest - frame radio and far - infrared ( fir ) . for galaxies at high redshift these bands",
    "are shifted into the optical and radio / sub - mm , allowing observations from the ground .",
    "still , the problem of translating the observed emission to star formation rate ( sfr ) involves large uncertainty .",
    "this is partly because each band traces only a minor portion of the total energy output of stars .",
    "moreover , the optical / uv band is significantly affected by dust obscuration , thus requiring order of magnitude corrections , while the sub - mm and radio bands lack sensitivity , and therefore uncover only the most prodigiously star - forming galaxies .",
    "the main result that has emerged from star formation surveys over the past few years is exemplified in the so - called madau diagram .",
    "namely , the sfr volume density , @xmath10 , rises steeply to @xmath11 , and seemingly peaks at @xmath12 .",
    "there is still some debate about the how steep the rise is , with values ranging from @xmath13 @xcite to @xmath14 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution beyond @xmath15 is even less clear since optical / uv observations indicate a decline @xcite , while recent sub - mm observations argue for a flat @xmath10 to higher redshift , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "consistency with this trend can be obtained by invoking large dust corrections in the optical / uv @xcite . for general reviews of star formation surveys",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    despite the significant progress in this field , our current understanding of star formation and its redshift evolution",
    "is still limited by the biases and shortcomings of current optical / uv , sub - mm , and radio selection techniques . in particular , despite the fact that the optical / uv band is sensitive to galaxies with modest star formation rates ( down to a fraction of a m@xmath3 yr@xmath5 ) at high redshift , these surveys may miss the most dusty , and vigorously star - forming galaxies .",
    "moreover , it is not clear if the simple , locally - calibrated prescriptions for correcting the observed _ un - obscured _ sfr for dust extinction ( e.g.  @xcite ) , hold at high redshift ; even if they do , these prescriptions involve an order of magnitude correction .",
    "finally , the optical / uv surveys are magnitude limited , and therefore miss the faintest sources .",
    "sub - mm surveys have uncovered a population of highly dust - extincted galaxies , which are usually optically faint , and have star formation rates of several hundred m@xmath3 yr@xmath5 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , unlike optical / uv surveys , sub - mm surveys are severely sensitivity limited , and only detect galaxies with @xmath17 l@xmath3 .",
    "more importantly , current sub - mm bolometer arrays ( such as scuba ) have large beams on the sky ( @xmath18 arcsec ) making it difficult to unambiguously identify optical counterparts ( which are usually faint to begin with ) , and hence measure the redshifts @xcite ; in fact , of the @xmath19 sub - mm galaxies identified to date , only a handful have a measured redshift . finally , translating the observed sub - mm emission to a sfr",
    "requires significant assumptions about the temperature of the dust , and the dust emission spectrum ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "surveys at decimeter radio wavelengths also suffer from low sensitivity , but the high astrometric accuracy afforded by synthesis arrays such as the vla allows a sub - arcsec localization of the radio - selected galaxies . as a result , it is easier to identify the optical counterparts of these sources .",
    "recently , this approach has been used to pre - select sources for targeted sub - mm observations resulting in an increase in the sub - mm detection rate @xcite and redshift determination @xcite . however , this method is biased toward finding luminous ( high sfr ) sources since it requires an initial radio detection .",
    "an additional problem with radio , even more than with sub - mm , selection is contamination by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "an examination of the x - ray properties of radio and sub - mm selected galaxies reveals that of the order of @xmath1 can have a significant agn component @xcite .    the most significant problem with current star formation studies , however , is that the link between the optical and sub - mm / radio samples is still not well understood .",
    "the hubble deep field provides a clear illustration : the brightest sub - mm source does not appear to have an optical counterpart @xcite , and only recently a detection has been claimed in the near - ir ( @xmath20 mag ; @xcite ) . along the same line",
    ", sub - mm observations of the optically - selected lyman break galaxies have resulted in very few detections @xcite , and even the brightest lyman break galaxies appear to be faint in the sub - mm band @xcite . in addition , there is considerable diversity in the properties of optical counterparts to sub - mm sources , ranging from galaxies which are faint in both the optical and near - ir ( nir ) to those which are bright in both bands @xcite .    as a result of the unclear overlap , and the sensitivity and dust problems in the sub - mm and optical surveys , the fractions of global star formation in the optical and sub - mm / radio selected galaxies",
    "is not well constrained .",
    "it is therefore not clear if the majority of star formation takes place in ultra - luminous galaxies with very high star formation rates , or in the more abundant lower luminosity galaxies with star formation rates of a few m@xmath3 yr@xmath5 .",
    "given the difficulty with redshift identification of sub - mm galaxies , the redshift distribution of dusty star forming galaxies remains highly uncertain .",
    "one way to alleviate some of these problems is to study a sample of galaxies that is immune to the selection biases of current optical / uv and sub - mm / radio surveys , and which may draw a more representative sample of the underlying distribution of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the host galaxies of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) may provide one such sample .",
    "the main advantages of the sample of grb host galaxies are : ( i ) the galaxies are selected with no regard to their emission properties in any wavelength regime , ( ii ) the dust - penetrating power of the @xmath0-ray emission results in a sample that is completely unbiased with respect to the global dust properties of the hosts , ( iii ) grbs can be observed to very high redshifts with existing missions ( @xmath21 ; @xcite ) , and as a result volume corrections for the star formation rates inferred from their hosts are trivial , ( iv ) the redshift of the galaxy can be determined via absorption spectroscopy of the optical afterglow , or x - ray spectroscopy allowing a redshift measurement of arbitrarily faint galaxies ( the current record - holder is the host of grb990510 with @xmath22 mag and @xmath23 ; @xcite ) , and ( v ) since there is excellent circumstantial evidence linking grbs to massive stars ( e.g.  @xcite , the sample of grb hosts is expected to trace global star formation @xcite .    of course , the sample of grb hosts is not immune from its own problems and potential biases .",
    "the main problem is the relatively small size of the sample in comparison to both the optical and sub - mm samples ( although the number of grb hosts with a known redshift exceeds the number of sub - mm galaxies with a measured redshift ) . as a result ,",
    "at the present it is not possible to assess the sfr density that is implied by grb hosts , or its redshift evolution .",
    "a bias towards sub - solar metallicity for grb progenitors ( and hence their environments ) has been discussed @xcite , but it appears that very massive stars ( e.g.  @xmath24 m@xmath3 ) should produce black holes even at solar metallicity .",
    "the impact of metallicity on additional aspects of grb formation ( e.g.  angular momentum , loss of hydrogen envelope ) is not clear at present .",
    "finally , given the observed dispersion in metallicity within galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , it is likely that even if grbs require low metallicity progenitors , this does not imply that the galaxy as a whole has a lower than average metallicity .    to date ,",
    "grb host galaxies have mainly been studied in the optical and nir bands .",
    "with the exception of one source ( grb020124 ; @xcite ) , every grb localized to a sub - arcsecond position has been associated with a star - forming galaxy @xcite .",
    "these galaxies range from @xmath25 mag , have a median redshift , @xmath26 , and are generally typical of star - forming galaxies at similar redshifts in terms of morphology and luminosity @xcite , with star formation rates from optical spectroscopy of @xmath27 m@xmath3 yr@xmath5 . at the same time , there are hints for higher than average ratios of [ neiii]3869 to [ oii]3727 , possibly indicating the presence of massive stars @xcite .",
    "only two host galaxies have been detected so far in the radio ( grb980703 ; @xcite ) and sub - mm ( grb010222 ; @xcite ) .    here",
    "we present sub - mm and radio observations of a sample of @xmath28 grb host galaxies , ranging in redshift from about @xmath29 to @xmath30 (  [ sec : obs ] ) ; one of the 20 sources is detected with high significance in both the sub - mm and radio bands , and an additional source is detected in the sub - mm (  [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "we compare the detected sub - mm and radio host galaxies to local and high-@xmath31 ultra - luminous galaxies in  [ sec : sed ] , and derive the sfrs in  [ sec : sfr ] .",
    "we then compare the inferred sfrs of the detected host galaxies , and the ensemble of undetected hosts , to optical estimates in  [ sec : opt ] .",
    "finally , we compare the optical properties of the grb host galaxies to those of sub - mm and radio selected star - forming galaxies (  [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "at the time we conducted our survey , the sample of grb host galaxies numbered 25 , twenty of which had measured redshifts .",
    "these host galaxies were localized primarily based on optical afterglows , but also using the radio and x - ray afterglow emission .",
    "of the 25 host galaxies we observed eight in both the radio and sub - mm , seven in the radio , and five in the sub - mm .",
    "the galaxies were drawn from the list of 25 hosts at random , constrained primarily by the availability of observing time .",
    "thus , the sample presented here does not suffer from any obvious selection biases , with the exception of detectable afterglow emission in at least one band .",
    "sub - mm observations of grb afterglows , and a small number of host galaxies have been undertaken in the past . starting in 1997 , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have searched for sub - mm emission from the afterglow of thirteen grbs .",
    "while they did not detect any afterglow emission , these authors used their observations to place constraints on emission from eight host galaxies , with typical @xmath32 rms values of 1.2 mjy .",
    "since these were target - of - opportunity observations , they were not always undertaken in favorable observing conditions .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported targeted sub - mm observations of the host galaxies of four optically - dark grbs ( i.e.  grbs lacking an optical afterglow ) .",
    "they focused on these particular sources since one explanation for the lack of optical emission is obscuration by dust , which presumably points to a dusty host .",
    "none of the hosts were detected , with the possible exception of grb000210 ( see  [ sec:0210 ] ) , leading the authors to conclude that the hosts of dark bursts are not necessarily heavily dust obscured .",
    "thus , the observations presented here provide the most comprehensive and bias - free search for sub - mm emission from grb host galaxies , and the first comprehensive search for radio emission .",
    "observations in the sub - mm band were carried out using the sub - millimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ; holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "we observed the positions of thirteen well - localized grb afterglows with the long ( 850 @xmath33 m ) and short ( 450 @xmath33 m ) arrays .",
    "the observations , summarized in table  [ tab : submm ] , were conducted in photometry mode with the standard nine - jiggle pattern using the central bolometer in each of the two arrays to observe the source . in the case of grb000301c",
    "we used an off - center bolometer in each array due to high noise levels in the central bolometer .    to account for variations in the sky brightness , we used a standard chopping of the secondary mirror between the on - source position and a position 60 arcsec away in azimuth , at a frequency of 7.8125 hz .",
    "in addition , we used a two - position beam switch ( nodding ) , in which the beam is moved off - source in each exposure to measure the sky .",
    "measurements of the sky opacity ( sky - dips ) were taken approximately every two hours , and the focus and array noise were checked at least twice during each shift .",
    "the pointing was checked approximately once per hour using several sources throughout each shift , and was generally found to vary by @xmath34 arcsec ( i.e.  less than one quarter of the beam size ) .",
    "all observations were performed in band 2 and 3 weather with @xmath35 .",
    "the data were initially reduced with the scuba data reduction facility ( surf ) following the standard reduction procedure .",
    "the off - position pointings were subtracted from the on - position pointings to account for chopping and nodding of the telescope .",
    "noisy bolometers were removed to facilitate a more accurate sky subtraction ( see below ) , and the data were then flat - fielded to account for the small differences in bolometer response .",
    "extinction correction was performed using a linear interpolation between skydips taken before and after each set of on - source scans .",
    "in addition to the sky subtraction offered by the nodding and chopping , short - term sky contributions were subtracted by using all low - noise off - source bolometers ( sky bolometers ) .",
    "this procedure takes advantage of the fact that the sky contribution is correlated across the array . as a result",
    ", the flux in the sky bolometers can be used to assess the sky contribution to the flux in the on - source bolometer .",
    "this procedure is especially crucial when observing weak sources , since the measured flux may be dominated by the sky .",
    "we implemented the sky subtraction using surf and our own routine using matlab .",
    "we found that in general the surf sky subtraction under - estimated the sky contribution , and as a result over - estimated the source fluxes .",
    "we therefore used the results of our own analysis routine . for this purpose",
    "we calculated the median value of the two ( three ) outer rings of bolometers in the 850 @xmath33 m ( 450 @xmath33 m ) array , after removing noisy bolometers ( defined as those whose standard deviation over a whole scan deviated by more than 5@xmath36 from the median standard deviation of all sky bolometers ) .",
    "following the sky subtraction , we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the mean ( sdom ) for each source in a given observing shift .",
    "noisy data were eliminated in two ways .",
    "first , the data were binned into 25 equal time bins , and the sdom was calculated step - wise , i.e.  at each step the data from an additional bin were added and the mean and sdom were re - calculated . in an ideal situation where the data quality remains approximately constant , the sdom should progressively decrease as more data are accumulated .",
    "however , if the quality of the data worsens ( due to deteriorating weather conditions for example ) the sdom will increase .",
    "we therefore removed time bins in which the sdom increased .",
    "following this procedure , we recursively eliminated individual noisy data points using a sigma cutoff level based on the number of data points ( chauvenet s criterion ; @xcite ) until the mean converged on a constant value . typically , two or three iterations were required , with only a few data points rejected each time . typically , only a few percent of the data were rejected by the two procedures .",
    "finally , flux conversion factors ( fcfs ) were applied to the resulting voltage measurements to convert the signal to jy . using photometry observations of mars and uranus , and/or secondary calibrators ( oh231.8 + 4.2 , irc+10216 , and crl618 )",
    ", we found the fcf to vary between @xmath37 jy / v at 850 @xmath33 m , consistent with the typical value of @xmath38 . at 450 @xmath33 m ,",
    "the fcfs varied between @xmath39 jy / v .",
    "_ very large array ( vla ) : _ we observed @xmath40 grb afterglow positions with the vla from april 2001 to february 2002 .",
    "all sources were observed at 8.46 ghz in the standard continuum mode with @xmath41 mhz bands .",
    "in addition , was observed at 1.43 and 4.86 ghz , and grb0010222 was observed at 4.86 ghz . in table",
    "[ tab : rad ] we provide a summary of the observations .    in principle , since the median spectrum of faint radio sources between 1.4 and 8.5 ghz is @xmath42 @xcite , the ideal vla frequency for our observations ( taking into account the sensitivity at each frequency ) is 1.43 ghz .",
    "however , we chose to observe primarily at 8.46 ghz for the following reason . the majority of our observations were taken in the bnc , c , cnd , and d configurations , in which the typical synthesized beam size is @xmath43 arcsec at 1.43 ghz , compared to @xmath44 arcsec at 8.46 ghz .",
    "the large synthesized beam at 1.43 ghz , combined with the larger field of view and higher intrinsic brightness of radio sources at this frequency , would result in a significant decrease in sensitivity due to source confusion .",
    "thus , we were forced to observe at higher frequencies , in which the reduced confusion noise more than compensates for the typical steep spectrum .",
    "we chose 8.46 ghz rather than 4.86 ghz since the combination of @xmath1 higher sensitivity and @xmath45 lower confusion noise , provide a more significant impact than the typical @xmath46 decrease in intrinsic brightness .",
    "the 1.43 ghz observations of were undertaken in the a configuration , where confusion does not play a limiting role .    for flux calibration we used the extragalactic sources 3c48 ( j0137 + 331 ) , 3c147 ( j0542 + 498 ) , and 3c286 ( j1331 + 305 ) , while the phases were monitored using calibrator sources within @xmath47 of the survey sources .",

    "one additional source , grb000210 , is detected with @xmath51 when combining our observations with those of @xcite .",
    "two hosts have radio fluxes with @xmath52 ( grb000301c and grb000926 ) , but as we show below this is due in part to emission from the afterglow .",

    "one obvious source for the observed radio and sub - mm fluxes ( other than the putative host galaxies ) is emission from the afterglows . to assess the possibility that our observations are contaminated by flux from the afterglows we note that the observations have been undertaken at least a year after the grb explosion . on this timescale",
    ", the sub - mm emission from the afterglow is expected to be much lower than the detection threshold of our observations .",
    "in fact , the brightest sub - mm afterglows to date have only reached a flux of a few mjy ( at 350 ghz ) , and typically exhibited a fading rate of @xmath56 after about one day following the burst @xcite .",

    "the radio emission from grb afterglows is more long - lived , and hence posses a more serious problem . however , on the typical timescale of the radio observations the 8.46 ghz flux is expected to be at most a few @xmath33jy ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in the following sections we discuss the individual detections in the radio and sub - mm , and also provide an estimate for the radio emission from each afterglow .",

    "in addition , the small offset of grb980703 relative to its radio host galaxy ( @xmath240 arcsec ; @xmath241 kpc at the redshift of the burst ) , combined with the negligible extinction , indicates that while the burst probably exploded in a region of intense star formation , it either managed to destroy a large amount of dust in its vicinity , or the dust distribution is patchy .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to evaluate the potential of dust destruction by grbs ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , but it is clear that the grbs that exploded in the detected sub - mm and radio host galaxies , did not occur in the most heavily obscured star formation sites .",
    "as we noted in  [ sec : sed ] , the optical / nir colors of the detected grb host galaxies are bluer than those of arp220 ( @xmath242 mag ) and hur10 ( @xmath243 mag ; @xcite ) . in this section",

    "to facilitate a more direct comparison with the grb sample we calculate the mean values for the sub - mm sample in the same redshift range as the grb hosts : @xmath250 mag and @xmath251 . moreover ,",
    "if we examine only the host galaxies that were detected in the radio and sub - mm with high significance we find @xmath9 colors of : 2.2 mag ( grb000418 ) , 2.8 mag ( grb980703 ) , 2.1 mag ( grb010222 ) , and 2.6 ( grb000210 ) .",
    "the bluest sub - mm galaxies , on the other hand , have @xmath252 mag . in general , the grb hosts that are detected with @xmath51 in the sub - mm and radio have a distribution of @xmath9 that is indistinguishable from the general grb host galaxy sample .",
    "the obvious difference in @xmath9 color indicates that the grb and radio / sub - mm selections result in a somewhat different set of galaxies .",
    "the red colors of the sub - mm selected galaxies are not surprising since these sources are expected to be dust obscured .",
    "on the other hand , the mean color of the grb hosts is bluer by about 2.5 mag ( @xmath253 significance ) compared to sub - mm galaxies in the same redshift range , indicating a bias towards less dust obscuration . a more patchy dust distribution , or intrinsically bluer colors .",
    "it is possible that there is a bias toward less dust obscuration in the general grb host sample because the bursts that explode in dusty galaxies would have obscured optical afterglows , and hence no accurate localization .",
    "however , this is not a likely explanation since the grbs which exploded in the sub - mm and radio bright hosts are not significantly dust obscured (  [ sec : opt ] ) .",
    "moreover , it does not appear that the hosts of dark grbs are brighter in the sub - mm as expected if the dust obscuration is global @xcite .",
    "finally , the localization of afterglows in the radio and x - rays allows the selection of host galaxies even if they are dusty .",
    "in particular , the only two grbs in which significant obscuration of the optical afterglow has been inferred ( grb970828 : @xcite ; grb000210 : piro et al .",
    "2002 ) , have been localized thanks to accurate positions from the radio and x - ray afterglows , and have host galaxies with @xmath9 colors of 3.7 and 2.6 mag , not significantly redder than the general population of grb hosts .",
    "therefore , a bias against dust obscured host galaxies is not the reason for the bluer color of the sample .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the distribution of dust in grb hosts is different than in the radio pre - selected and sub - mm selected galaxies",
    ". this may be in terms of a spatially patchy distribution , which will allow more of the uv light to escape , or a different distribution of grain sizes ( i.e.  a different extinction law ) , possibly due to a different average metallicity .",
    "however , in both cases it is not clear why there should be a correlation between the dust properties of the galaxy and the occurence of a grb .",
    "finally , it is possible that grb host galaxies are preferentially in an earlier stage of the star formation ( or starburst ) process . in this case",
    ", a larger fraction of the shorter - lived massive stars would still be shining , and the overall color of the galaxy would be bluer relative to a galaxy with an older population of stars . one way to examine the age of the stellar population",
    "is to fit population synthesis models to the broad - band optical / nir spectra of the host galaxies .",
    "this approach has recently been used by @xcite who find some evidence that the age of the stellar population in some grb host galaxies ( including the host of grb980703 ) is relatively young , of the order of @xmath254 myr .",
    "this result is also expected",
    "if grbs arise from massive stars , as indicated by recent observations ( e.g.  @xcite ) , since in this case grbs would preferentially select galaxies with younger star formation episodes .",
    "regardless of the exact reason for the preferential selection of bluer galaxies relative to the radio pre - selected sub - mm population , two results seem clear : ( i ) the grb host galaxies detected in the sub - mm and radio are likely drawn from a population that is generally missed in current sub - mm surveys , and ( ii ) grb host galaxies may not be a completely bias - free sample .",
    "the first point is particularly interesting in light of the fact that optical observations of these host galaxies do not identify them as particularly exceptional in terms of sfr .",
    "therefore , while similar galaxies are not necessarily missed in optical surveys , their star formation rates are likely under - estimated .",
    "we presented the most comprehensive scuba , vla , and atca observations of grb host galaxies to date .",
    "the host galaxy of is the only source detected with high significance in both the sub - mm and radio , while the host galaxy of grb000210 is detected with @xmath255 in the sub - mm when we combine our observations with those of @xcite .",
    "when taken in conjunction with the previous detections of grb980703 in the radio @xcite and grb010222 in the sub - mm @xcite , these observations point to a @xmath256 detection rate in the radio / sub - mm .",
    "this detection rate confirms predictions for the number of sub - mm bright grb hosts , with @xmath257 mjy , based on current models of the star formation history assuming a large fraction of obscured star formation @xcite .",
    "the host galaxies detected in the sub - mm and radio have star formation rates from about @xmath258 to @xmath259 m@xmath3 yr@xmath5 , while statistically the non - detected sources have an _ average _ sfr of about @xmath6 m@xmath3 yr@xmath5 . these star formation rates exceed the optically - inferred values by over an order of magnitude , pointing to significant dust obscuration within the grb host galaxies detected in the sub - mm and radio , and possibly the sample as a whole .    still , the optical afterglows of the bursts that exploded in the sub - mm / radio bright host galaxies did not suffer significant extinction , indicating that : ( i ) the grbs did not explode in regions where dust obscuration is significant , or ( ii ) the uv and x - ray emission from the afterglow destroys a significant amount of dust in the local vicinity of the burst .",
    "we have also shown that grb host galaxies , even those detected in the sub - mm / radio , have bluer @xmath9 colors compared to galaxies selected in the sub - mm or radio bands in the same redshift range .",
    "this is not the result of an observational bias against dusty galaxies in the grb host sample since the afterglows of grbs which exploded in the radio / sub - mm bright hosts were not significantly obscured .",
    "more likely , this is the result of younger stellar populations in these galaxies , or possibly a patchy dust distribution .",
    "if the reason is younger stellar population then this provides additional circumstantial evidence in favor of massive ( and hence short - lived ) stars as the likely progenitors of grbs .",
    "a potential bias of the grb host galaxy sample is that the popular `` collapsar '' model of grbs calls for high mass , low metallicity stellar progenitors @xcite .",
    "this may result in preferential selection of low metallicity ( and hence less dusty ) host galaxies .",
    "however , it appears that grb progenitors can even have solar metallicity , and that a very low metallicity is unfavored by the required initial conditions for a grb explosion .",
    "moreover , studies of the milky way ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , local galaxies ( e.g  @xcite ) , and high-@xmath31 galaxies",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , indicate that there are considerable variations in metallicity within galaxies",
    ". this may be especially true if several independent episodes of star formation have occured within the galaxy .",
    "thus , even if there is a bias towards low metallicity for grb progenitors ( and hence their immediate environments ) it is not obvious that this introduces a bias in the host galaxy sample .",
    "nonetheless , while the observations presented in this paper clearly indicate the potential of grb selection of high-@xmath31 galaxies for the study of star formation , a much larger sample is required to complement existing optical and sub - mm surveys .",
    "this may become possible in the near future with the upcoming launch ( sep .",
    "2003 ) of swift . with an anticipated rapid ( @xmath260 minute ) and accurate localization of about 150 bursts per year",
    ", the grb - selected sample will probably increase to several hundred galaxies over the next few years .",
    "the rapid localization would most likely result in a large fraction of redshift measurements thanks to the bright optical afterglows .",
    "in addition to the localization of a large number of grb hosts , the study of these galaxies ( as well as those in other samples ) would greatly benefit from the advent of new facilities , such as sirtf , alma , evla , and the ska . in figure",

    "the contributions of these new facilities to star formation studies are threefold : ( i ) increased sensitivity , ( ii ) increased resolution , and ( iii ) increased frequency coverage .",
    "these improvements will serve to ameliorate the main limitations of present radio , sub - mm , and ir observations (  [ sec : intro ] ) , by allowing the detection of more representative star forming galaxies at high redshift , in addition to a better constraint on the total dust bolometric luminosity and accurate localizations , which would facilitate follow - ups at optical wavelengths . in conjunction with increasingly larger samples of galaxies selected in the optical , the radio / sub - mm / ir , and by grbs",

    "<S> this possibly indicates that the stellar populations in the grb hosts are on average younger , supporting the massive stellar progenitor scenario for grbs , but it is also possible that grb hosts are on average less dusty . beyond the specific results presented in this paper , the sub - mm and radio observations serve as an observational proof - of - concept in anticipation of the upcoming launch of the swift grb mission and sirtf . </S>",
