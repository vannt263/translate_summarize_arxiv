    "an important open problem in quantum information concerns the feasibility of a _ self - correcting quantum memory_. finding a system that protects a quantum state from decoherence induced by a thermal bath , without the need for active monitoring and error - correction , proves much more difficult than in the classical case . on the most basic level , this is due to the fact that a classical bit only needs protection against logical @xmath2 operations while a qubit needs protection against a logical @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "if a state is stored in a many - qubit system , a desirable feature is _ topological protection _ of the stored ( qu-)bit : we want a logical error @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 in the quantum case ) to necessitate a number of single - qubit errors @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) that scales with @xmath0 , the linear size of the memory .",
    "the simplest model that energetically penalizes @xmath4 errors and offers topological protection of a stored classical bit is the 1d ferromagnetic ising model .",
    "the simplest model that penalizes @xmath4 and @xmath5 errors and topologically protects a qubit is given by kitaev s 2d toric code hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in fact , the latter can be mapped exactly to two independent copies of the former @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , both of these systems are not thermally stable .",
    "once a topological defect ( a pair of domain walls in the 1d ising model or a pair of anyons in the 2d toric code ) has been created , it can spread and lead to a logical error without any further energy cost .",
    "the lifetime of a qubit stored in the degenerate ground states of the 2d toric code is thus for any finite temperature upper - bounded by a constant independent of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the 2d toric code can therefore not serve as a ` quantum hard drive ' .",
    "these difficulties can be overcome if the dimensionality of the systems is increased . in the 2d ising model and the 4d toric code",
    ", any sequence of single - qubit pauli operators that leads to a logical error has to surpass an energy barrier whose size scales with @xmath0 .",
    "since the number of error paths connecting two distinct ground states is exponentially large in @xmath0 , these systems are thermally stable below some critical temperature @xmath6 , meaning that the lifetime of the stored information grows exponentially with @xmath0 @xcite .    whether a similar degree of protection for a quantum state can be achieved in less than four dimensions",
    "is not clear .",
    "one can show that for _ every _ 2d local stabilizer hamiltonian the height of the energy barrier separating orthogonal states stored in a degenerate ground state is upper bounded by a constant independent of @xmath0 @xcite , ruling out the possibility of using such systems for the fault - tolerant storage of quantum information by self - correction . in principle , these no - go results leave two ways out : either one abandons the locality of the terms in the hamiltonian or one goes to dimension 3 .",
    "indeed , both of these routes have been followed in the recent literature . while the 3d toric code is not thermally stable , haah showed in a recent breakthrough the existence of 3d hamiltonians with local interactions that have no string - like logical operators @xcite . unlike anyons in the 2d toric code , defects can not move further than a certain constant distance away without creating other defects .",
    "this property implies a logarithmically growing energy barrier between orthogonal ground states , leading one to expect a lifetime that grows polynomially with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , the best known lower bound on the memory lifetime of haah s hamiltonian is upper - bounded by a constant independent of @xmath0 @xcite and further improvement is not expected @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a 3d architecture may lead to practical difficulties when accessing the physical qubits for syndrome measurement and error correction .",
    "we therefore believe that the most promising route to follow in search for a realistic proposal for a quantum memory is to start from the 2d toric code hamiltonian and add terms to it that    * can be physically motivated , and * lead to a memory lifetime that becomes arbitrarily large as @xmath7  .",
    "long - range repulsive interactions ( @xmath8-potential with @xmath9 ) between the anyons lead to a logarithmically - growing self - consistent mean field gap for anyon creation , yielding a polynomially increasing lifetime @xcite , see sec .  [ sec : longrange ] below .",
    "so rather than trying to find a hamiltonian with a macroscopic energy barrier between orthogonal ground states , this approach seeks to suppress the anyon creation rate .",
    "the toric code hamiltonian ( involving local _",
    "four_-qubit couplings ) with non - interacting anyons can be obtained as an effective hamiltonian of the kitaev honeycomb model , which involves nearest - neighbor _ two_-qubit ising couplings @xcite .",
    "how an @xmath10 interaction between the anyons can be obtained through such a honeycomb model coupled to electromagnetic modes has been studied in detail in @xcite , see sec .",
    "[ sec : honeycomb ] below .",
    "in an alternative approach it was shown that coupling the toric code to a bosonic field leads to an effective gravitational potential between the anyonic defects @xcite .",
    "below some critical temperature , all anyons coalesce to a single point .",
    "however , the time the system needs to approach this metastable state and how to best perform error correction in this system have not been investigated so far .",
    "self - correcting quantum memories are usually discussed with periodic boundary conditions , giving the toric code its name .",
    "this way , the complications that arise with the possibility of creating unpaired topological defects at the boundaries can be avoided .",
    "one expects that the influence of the boundaries becomes negligible if @xmath0 becomes large enough , which is certainly correct for hamiltonians with local interactions .",
    "however , here we study memories with long - range interactions between the anyons as proposed in @xcite and show that for these systems the influence of the boundary becomes in fact _",
    "dominant _ for large enough @xmath0 .",
    "it can be beneficial and detrimental . specifically , unpaired anyons from the boundary lead to an effective bias for anyons from the bulk to move to the closest boundary , thus prolonging the time until error correction becomes ambiguous ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : longrange ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", the ability to create unpaired anyons at the boundaries halves the energetic gap above the anyonic vacuum .",
    "this becomes especially relevant if this gap is so strong that the anyonic system is basically restricted to its ground state and first excited state ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : honeycomb ] ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : correction ] we discuss how error correction can be performed in the planar code ( a toric code with open boundaries ) in contact with a thermal environment . in section [ sec : longrange ]",
    "we study the influence of the boundaries for a hamiltonian with spatially constant repulsion between the anyons , while in section [ sec : honeycomb ] an effective hamiltonian that describes repulsion between anyons and anyon holes is investigated .",
    "a self - correcting quantum memory is supposed to protect a quantum state from a thermal environment by means of its internal dynamics and without need for active error - correction .",
    "a single error correction step may be performed before the stored state is read out .",
    "we shall use here a version of the toric code first introduced in @xcite , which , contrary to what the name suggests , is not periodic but does have a boundary .",
    "we will refer to this as the _ planar code_. consider a grid with quadratic cells and physical qubits placed on the edges , as depicted in figure  [ fig : stabilizers ] .",
    "we call the four qubits around one unit cell a ` plaquette ' and the four qubits around a vertex a ` star ' .",
    "we define plaquette operators @xmath11 , where the tensor product runs over the four qubits around some plaquette @xmath12 and star operators @xmath13 , where the tensor product runs over the four qubits around some vertex @xmath14 .",
    "plaquette operators on the left and right boundary and star operators on the top an bottom boundary are tensor products of three pauli operators only .",
    "all of these operators are commuting since they overlap at zero or two qubits .",
    "let the space @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the total number of qubits ) be defined as the space stabilized by all plaquette and star operators .",
    "that is , @xmath17 is the space of all states @xmath18 such that for each three- or four - qubit plaquette or star operator @xmath19 or @xmath20 we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 . since all the plaquette and star operators are independent ( unlike in the toric code where the product of all plaquette and star stabilizer operators is the identity ) , one easily verifies that @xmath23 , independent of the height and width of the grid @xcite , such that one logical qubit can be stored in this space .",
    "states in @xmath17 are _ topologically protected_. they can not be distinguished by any local observable and not be evolved into each other by any local unitary .",
    "we then define a hamiltonian that imposes an energy penalty for the violation of every stabilizer condition .",
    "let @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the tensor products run over the qubits depicted in figure  [ fig : stabilizers ] .",
    "these operators have eigenvalue @xmath28 for states that satisfy the corresponding stabilizer conditions and eigenvalue @xmath29 for states that violate it . for some state @xmath30",
    "we say that an anyon is present at plaquette @xmath12 ( vertex @xmath14 ) if @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and that no anyon is present if @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , i.e.  we interpret stabilizer violations as the presence of anyons .",
    "we then use the well - known toric code hamiltonian @xmath35 which simply counts the total number of anyons . the code subspace @xmath17 , which is the degenerate ground state of this hamiltonian , corresponds to the anyonic vacuum .",
    "this hamiltonian is stable against weak local perturbations in the sense that the lifting of the ground state degeneracy through such a perturbation is exponentially small in @xmath0 @xcite .    .",
    "depicted are a four - qubit plaquette operator @xmath36 , a three - qubit plaquette operator @xmath37 , a four - qubit star operator @xmath38 , and a three - qubit star operator @xmath39 .",
    "the logical operator @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is given by any chain of pauli operators @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) connecting the top and bottom ( left and right ) boundary.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    starting from the anyonic vacuum , if a qubit suffers a spin - flip error @xmath4 ( phase - flip error @xmath5 ) , two plaquette ( star ) anyons are created on the two adjacent plaquettes ( vertices ) .",
    "once an anyon exists , it can move on the surface without any further energy cost , whereby creating further spin- or phase - flip errors along its path .",
    "two anyons of the same kind can fuse to the vacuum . on the two horizontal ( vertical ) boundaries of the grid in figure  [ fig : stabilizers ] a single plaquette ( star )",
    "anyon can be created .",
    "similarly , the boundaries can absorb single anyons .",
    "if two anyons are jointly created from the vacuum , move around and then fuse to the vacuum , the produced error path can be expressed as a product of stabilizers and therefore acts trivially on the code subspace @xmath17 .",
    "the same holds if a single anyon is created on a boundary and then is absorbed by the same boundary again .",
    "the only possibility to act non - trivially on the state stored in @xmath17 is if an error path connects the two opposite boundaries .",
    "we therefore define the logical operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 acting on all qubits along the paths depicted in figure  [ fig : stabilizers ] . since all such products that connect",
    "the two opposite boundaries are identical up to multiplication with stabilizers , the precise form of the path does not matter .",
    "these operators commute with all the stabilizers ( i.e.  they are elements of the centralizer of the stabilizer group ) though are not products of stabilizers .",
    "they allow thus to act non - trivially on the state stored in @xmath17 without leaving any smoking guns in the form of anyons .",
    "they satisfy @xmath42 and @xmath43 and may therefore be seen as pauli operators acting on the encoded qubit .    at the read - out step , all the operators @xmath38 and @xmath36 are measured and the presence of anyons ( the _ syndrome _ ) is detected .",
    "the goal is then to annihilate all anyons ( either by fusing them to the vacuum or by moving them to a boundary that can absorb them ) and thereby to undo the errors caused by the diffusion of the anyons .",
    "more precisely , the goal is that the total unitary formed by the natural anyon dynamics ( creation , diffusion , and annihilation ) plus the error correction procedure is equal to a product of stabilizers and thus acts trivially on the code space .",
    "even more precisely , the dynamics induced by the thermal environment are in fact a probabilistic mixture of different unitary evolutions , this will be discussed in more detail later on .",
    "we will study planar codes of different sizes @xmath0 , by which we mean that the number of plaquette operators from top to bottom as well as the number of star operators from left to right is given by @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , there are @xmath44 four - qubit plaquettes and @xmath45 three - qubit plaquettes from left to right and thus a total of @xmath46 plaquettes . the total number of qubits is then given by @xmath47 .",
    "it is well - known that in the limit of large @xmath0 error correction in the toric code is unambiguously possible if less than @xmath48 of the physical qubits are subject to uncorrelated bit- and phase - flip errors @xcite .",
    "however , qubit errors induced by a thermal environment _ are _ correlated due to the diffusion of the anyons .",
    "error correction therefore typically becomes impossible if a few percent of the qubits have suffered errors @xcite .",
    "the error correction step consists of three substeps . in a first step ,",
    "the anyon configuration or syndrome is determined by measuring all the operators @xmath38 and @xmath36 .",
    "this means that we project to the subspaces @xmath49 with a given anyon configuration .",
    "since there are @xmath46 potential locations for anyons of each kind , there are @xmath50 such spaces , each of which has dimension @xmath45 ( they can be obtained from @xmath17 by applying single - qubit errors ) , so @xmath51 indeed , one verifies that @xmath52 equals @xmath53 . in a second step ,",
    "a classical computation is performed on the error syndrome whose output tells how to best annihilate the anyons by fusing them with each other or moving them to a boundary of the type that can absorb them , which is then done in a third step .    in a more formal language , let @xmath54 denote the initial state stored in the memory with @xmath55 .",
    "the influence of errors on this state is then captured by a quantum channel ( cptpm ) @xmath56 .",
    "the goal of the classical computation is then , given knowledge about the error model @xmath56 and the syndrome ( the space @xmath49 , that is ) , to find a sequence of single - qubit pauli operators @xmath57 which corrects the errors .",
    "in other words , we want @xmath57 to map @xmath49 to @xmath17 .",
    "now let @xmath58 denote the projector onto @xmath49 .",
    "formally , we can write the error - correction procedure performed on the corrupted state @xmath59 as @xmath60 . at the end of the day , we want the error @xmath61 to be as small as possible for any given encoded state @xmath54 .",
    "in the corrected state @xmath62 no anyons are left .",
    "we therefore either have successfully corrected all errors , performed a logical @xmath2 , a logical @xmath3 or both , thus @xmath63 ( assuming that the error correction procedure treats plaquette- and star - anyons independently ) . we therefore have @xmath64    in order to obtain simple scalar functions that characterize the decay of the stored quantum information , we study the autocorrelation functions @xmath65\\\\   & c^z_{{\\mathrm{corr}}}(t ) : = 2^{-n}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}\\left[z\\cdot\\left(\\phi_{{\\mathrm{corr}}}\\circ\\phi_{{\\mathrm{err}}}^t\\right){^{\\dagger}}(z)\\right]\\ .\\label{eq : czcorr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the prefactor is such that @xmath66 , assuming that no operation is performed on the stored information if no anyons are measured .",
    "this assumption is in fact less trivial than it may seem .",
    "performing a logical operation in the error correction step is beneficial if an odd number of logical operators have been performed by the bath .",
    "assume that the bath induces logical errors that leave no anyons with rate @xmath67 .",
    "then , the probability that no logical error has been performed is in fact small for times @xmath68 .",
    "the probability that after time @xmath69 @xmath70 logical errors have been performed is given by the poisson distribution , @xmath71 the poisson distribution is peaked around @xmath72 , which may be an odd integer .",
    "however , the probability @xmath73 of an even number of errors is greater than @xmath74 for any @xmath72 , such that the optimal strategy is , indeed , not to do anything if no anyon is detected .",
    "@xmath75 is @xmath29 if after error correction at time @xmath69 no logical @xmath3-operator has been applied and @xmath76 if one has been applied ( i.e.  an odd number of @xmath5-operators has been applied to any line connecting the left and right boundary ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath77 and analogously @xmath78 . in conclusion",
    "we have @xmath79 we define the lifetime @xmath80 of the memory as the maximal time such that @xmath81 for all @xmath82 , implying that @xmath83 for @xmath82 .",
    "the total evolution @xmath84 is a statistical mixture of different unitary evolutions . in the numerical simulations , we will in each run",
    "follow a definite unitary evolution , such that @xmath85 is at any time given by @xmath86 .",
    "the probability of a certain unitary is thereby determined by the error model @xmath56 . sampling over a large number of runs , we obtain a smooth function @xmath85 .",
    "we say that two sequences of single - qubit pauli operators are equivalent if they are identical up to multiplication with stabilizers . for every given anyon configuration , there are four equivalence classes of errors that produce it from the vacuum .",
    "these equivalence classes can be mapped onto each other by application of the logical operators @xmath87 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath88 .",
    "given a syndrome , the goal is to guess the most likely equivalence class of errors that has produced it , which one allows to remove the anyons without disturbing the stored quantum information .",
    "calculating the probabilities of the four equivalence classes is numerically too costly to be performed with current technology .",
    "we thus make the simplifying assumption that the most likely error path that has led to the given syndrome is an element of the most likely equivalence class",
    ". this may not be true for every possible anyon configuration but seems a reasonable approximation . applying stabilizers to the most likely error path",
    "will produce further error paths with identical or slightly lower probabilities that are elements of the same equivalence class .",
    "rather than finding the error path with maximal probability , we may equivalently find the error path with _ minimal weight _",
    ", if we define the weight to be the negative logarithm of the probability that a certain error chain has occurred . taking the negative logarithm ensures that the weight is additive for independent error chains .",
    "this is known as the shannon information content of an event in classical information theory @xcite and up to a constant factor the only function having the additivity property .    to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider a concrete simple error model .",
    "we assume that each physical qubit suffers a spin - flip error with probability @xmath89 and a phase - flip error with probability @xmath90 , @xmath91 the weight of an error chain involving @xmath92 spin - flips and @xmath93 phase - flips is then @xmath94 allowing us to minimize ( for @xmath95 ) @xmath92 and @xmath92 independently .",
    "the number of single - qubit pauli operators necessary to connect two anyons with each other is given by the so - called ` manhattan distance ' of the anyons , i.e.  the sum of the horizontal and the vertical coordinate difference of two anyons .",
    "similarly , the weight of a chain connecting an anyon to a boundary is given by the horizontal or vertical distance .",
    "in detail , our minimal weight matching of @xmath96 anyons ( of one kind ) then works as follows .    1 .",
    "perform a delaunay triangulation on the set of anyon coordinates , thereby restricting the full graph of @xmath97 edges between anyons to @xmath98 edges .",
    "calculate the manhattan weights of all edges in the restricted graph .",
    "2 .   for every anyon , add a ` virtual ' partner on the closer boundary able to absorb it and add an edge to the graph with weight given by the distance to the boundary .",
    "3 .   connect all virtual anyons with zero - weight edges .",
    "perform a minimum - weight matching of the graph obtained this way .",
    "points 1 .  and 4 .  are identical to the methods used in @xcite .",
    "we perform the delaunay triangulation using the library ` triangle ` @xcite while for the minimal - weight perfect matching we employ the library ` blossom v ` @xcite implementing the ` blossom ' algorithm due to edmond s @xcite .",
    "the numerical cost of this procedure is strongly dominated by the last step .",
    "adding the virtual anyons ensures that each real anyon can be connected to the closest edge able to absorb it and that there is always an even number of points in the graph entering the perfect matching algorithm . giving the edges between virtual anyons",
    "weight zero ensures that those virtual anyons that are not connected to a real one can be removed at no cost .",

    "the curves correspond to different lattice sizes @xmath99 ( blue ) , @xmath100 ( magenta ) and @xmath101 ( red ) .",

    "thus also reduces the exponentially increasing factor in the lifetime of the memory to ( almost ) its square root .",
    "the above results apply to the code during its thermalization . however , it is also interesting to study its properties once it reaches thermal equilibrium .",

    "let us consider the thermal state of the hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian is symmetric under exchange of anyons and anyon holes . since the gap above the ground states with all anyons or all holes grows as @xmath1 , the thermal state in the thermodynamic limit will be an equally weighted mixture of the all hole or all anyon states .",
    "as such , measurement of the occupancy of any plaquette can be used to determine the occupancies of all plaquettes .",
    "the region @xmath151 used in the definition of the anyonic topological entropy can then clearly deduce the net occupancy of the region @xmath150 .",
    "the value for this entropy therefore takes its maximum value of @xmath274 , and the state is found to be topologically ordered .",
    "stabilizer hamiltonians with local interactions in 2d do not , and in 3d seem not to , offer the possibility to passively store quantum states for a time that can be made arbitrarily larger than the relevant microscopic time - scales . inducing long - range interactions between the excitations of a 2d hamiltonian",
    "whose ground states are topologically ordered seems thus the most promising approach towards a realistic proposal for a quantum memory . for such long - range interactions , the influence of the boundary of the memory ( which every realistic memory will have ) is not negligible even for large @xmath0 .",
    "we discussed two hamiltonians proposed in the recent literature and showed that for those the boundary becomes in fact dominant .",
    "operationally , this fact becomes relevant during the error correction step before the read - out of the stored quantum state .",
    "we showed that the classical algorithm that determines how to best remove the anyonic defects has to depend on the error model , the memory hamiltonian and the boundary conditions .    with long - range repulsion between the anyons , the energy to add a further anyon increases with the number of already existing anyons , leading to a vanishing anyon production rate .",
    "if the production rates approach their equilibrium values , the production of unpaired anyons on the boundaries will outweigh the production of anyon pairs in the bulk .",
    "the influence of the boundary anyons is beneficial since they lead to an effective bias of the bulk anyons to move towards the closer boundary .",
    "we discussed how a planar code with topological protection of the stored qubit can be obtained from a honeycomb model with two - qubit ising coupling and the ability to perform single - qubit measurements on boundary qubits . in a resonant regime of a coupling of the honeycomb to cavity modes a very strong suppression of the anyon creation rate",

    "furthermore , most created anyons will immediately be reabsorbed by their creating boundary . in conclusion , we have found in this regime a lifetime that grows exponentially in @xmath1 , allowing in principle to reach macroscopic storage times even at moderately high temperatures .",
