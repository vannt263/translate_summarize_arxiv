    "wormhole physics dates back to the formulation of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "indeed , in 1916 , months after einstein presented his gravitational field equations , karl schwarzschild found the first solution of einstein s equations , which described the gravitational field of a vacuum non - rotating spherically symmetric solution . in the same year , ludwig flamm published a paper in which the geometry of the schwarzschild solution was studied more closely .",
    "he pointed out a `` tunnel - shaped '' nature of space near the schwarzschild radius , this being perhaps the first move towards the modern concept of the `` throat '' in wormholes @xcite .    paging through the literature , one finds next that tunnel - like solutions were considered , in 1935 , by einstein and rosen , where they constructed an elementary particle model represented by a bridge  connecting two identical sheets @xcite .",
    "they considered the possibility that fundamental particles such as the electron could be represented as microscopic spacetime tunnels that convey fluxes of the electric field .",
    "these tunnels were later denoted the _ einstein - rosen bridge_. in fact , the einstein - rosen bridge is a coordinate artifact arising from choosing a coordinate patch , which is defined to double - cover the asymptotically flat region exterior to the black hole event horizon .",
    "the field had lain dormant for about twenty years when , in 1955 , john wheeler , who was beginning to be interested in topological issues in gr , explored solutions of the coupled einstein  maxwell equations , which he denoted _ geons _",
    "( gravitational - electromagnetic entities ) @xcite .",
    "these were considered to be objects of the quantum foam connecting different regions of spacetime at the planck scale .",
    "however , the term ` wormhole ' was only used for the first time in 1957 @xcite , where misner and wheeler presented a tour de force wherein riemannian geometry of manifolds of nontrivial topology was investigated with an ambitious view to explaining all of physics .",
    "the aim was to use the source - free maxwell equations , coupled to einstein gravity , with nontrivial topology , to build models for classical electrical charges and all other particle  like entities in classical physics .",
    "subsequently to the geon concept , several wormhole solutions were obtained and discussed within different contexts @xcite .",
    "however , it was only in 1988 that the full - fledged renaissance of wormhole physics took place through the seminal morris - thorne paper @xcite , and the theme is still in full flight .",
    "morris and thorne , considered static and spherically symmetric traversable wormholes , and thoroughly analysed their fundamental properties .",
    "it was found that these traversable wormholes possess a stress - energy tensor that violates the null energy condition ( nec ) , a property that was denoted _",
    "exotic matter_. beside being hypothetical short - cuts in spacetime and consequently useful for inter- and intra - universe travel , they were found to possess other intriguing applications , such as , the usage for time - travel @xcite and investigating the interior of a black hole @xcite , amongst others .",
    "thus , a fundamental ingredient for the morris - thorne wormhole , i.e. , for static and spherically symmetric wormhole solutions , is the violation of the nec @xcite .",
    "exotic matter is particularly troublesome for measurements made by observers traversing through the throat with a radial velocity close to the speed of light , as for sufficiently high velocities , @xmath0 , the observer will measure a negative energy density @xcite .",
    "although classical forms of matter are believed to obey these energy conditions , it is a well - known fact that they are violated by certain quantum fields , such as the casimir effect .",
    "in fact , the recent discovery that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite may be due to an exotic cosmic fluid that lies in the phantom regime .",
    "the realization of this fact has led to the study of wormhole solutions supported by different kinds of phantom fluids ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "indeed the violation of the energy conditions is a subtle issue , as almost all known and physically possible forms of matter satisfy these energy conditions , and we recall that their imposition is one of the necessary assumptions for proving the hawking - penrose singularity theorems @xcite .",
    "thus , one may adopt the approach of minimizing the usage of exotic matter @xcite . in this context",
    ", a plethora of solutions have been investigated , using a wide variety of approaches diffpo , diffpo0,diffpo2,diffpo3,18 .",
    "more specifically , in rotating solutions it was found that the exotic matter lies in specific regions around the throat , so that it is possible for a certain class of infalling observers to move around the throat as to avoid the exotic matter supporting the wormhole @xcite . using the thin shell formalism , solutions where the exotic matter is concentrated at the throat",
    "have also been extensively investigated @xcite . in the context of modified gravity",
    "it was shown that one may impose that the matter threading the wormhole satisfies the energy conditions , so that it is the higher order curvature terms that sustain these exotic geometries @xcite .",
    "astrophysical signatures have also been explored in the literature harko:2008vy .    for dynamic wormholes , the nec , or more precisely the averaged null energy condition ,",
    "can be avoided in certain regions hochvisserprl98,hochvisserprd98,kar , kar - sahdev , kim - evolvwh , arellano:2006ex .",
    "a particularly interesting case is that of a wormhole in a time - dependent inflationary background @xcite , in which the primary goal was to use inflation to enlarge an initially small and possibly submicroscopic wormhole .",
    "it is also possible that the wormhole will continue to be enlarged by the subsequent frw phase of expansion .",
    "one could perform a similar analysis to @xcite by replacing the desitter scale factor by an frw scale factor @xcite . in particular , in kar , kar - sahdev specific examples for evolving wormholes that exist only for a finite time were considered , and a special class of scale factors that exhibit ` flashes ' of the wec violation were also analyzed .    the present paper investigates the possibility and naturalness of expanding wormholes in higher dimensions which is an important ingredient of the modern theories of fundamental physics , such as string theory , supergravity , kaluza - klein , and others .",
    "one of our motivations for considering wormhole solutions in an expanding cosmological background refers to the inflation theory guth where the quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field are considered as the seed of large scale structures in the universe .",
    "as mentioned above , the non - trivial topological objects such as microscopic wormholes may have been formed during inflation and enlarged to macroscopic ones as the universe expanded @xcite .",
    "we also explore the possibility that these higher - dimensional wormholes satisfy the nec , and we explicitly show that this is indeed the case .    this paper is organized in the following way : in section [ secii ] , we present the @xmath1dimensional field equations for the specific case of a spatially - independent curvature scalar . in section [ seciii ] ,",
    "we analyse the two - way traversability conditions of the wormhole structure . in section [ seciv ] , we explore wormhole solutions in different expansionary regimes , and finally in section [ conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "the action of gr in @xmath2dimensions is written as @xmath3where @xmath4 is the scalar curvature and @xmath5 is the matter lagrangian density ; we have considered @xmath6 . varying this action with respect to the metric",
    ", we obtain the @xmath2-dimensional einstein equations @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the matter stress - energy tensor .",
    "since we are looking for expanding wormhole solutions in a cosmological background , we use the metric@xmath10 ,   \\label{metn}\\]]in which @xmath11 is the scale factor and @xmath12 is an unknown dimensionless function , defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the shape function @xcite . note that this metric is a generalization of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , although being less symmetric than the latter . with this generalization ,",
    "metric ( [ metn ] ) is still isotropic about the center of the symmetry , though not necessarily homogeneous .",
    "when the dimensionless shape function vanishes , @xmath15 the metric ( metn ) reduces to the flat frw metric ; and as @xmath16 it approaches the static wormhole metric .    to see that the `` wormhole '' form of the metric is preserved with time , consider an embedding of @xmath17 and @xmath18 slices of the spacetime given by eq .",
    "( [ metn ] ) , in a flat 3-dimensional euclidean space with metric @xmath19 in this context , the metric of the wormhole slice is @xmath20 now , comparing the coefficients of @xmath21 , one has @xmath22 it is important to keep in mind , in particular , when considering derivatives , that eqs .",
    "( [ coef1:phi])-([coef2:phi ] ) do not represent a `` coordinate transformation '' , but rather a `` rescaling '' of the @xmath23 coordinate on each @xmath24 slice @xcite .",
    "with respect to the @xmath25 coordinates , the `` wormhole '' form of the metric will be preserved if the metric on the embedded slice has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 has a minimum at some @xmath29 .",
    "equation ( [ slice ] ) can be rewritten in the form of eq .",
    "( [ whslice ] ) by using eqs .",
    "( [ coef1:phi])-(coef2:phi ) and @xmath30 the evolving wormhole will have the same overall size and shape relative to the @xmath25 coordinate system , as the initial wormhole had relative to the initial @xmath31 embedding space coordinate system .",
    "this is due to the fact that the embedding space corresponds to @xmath32 coordinates that `` scale '' with time ( each embedding space corresponds to a particular value of @xmath24 ) . following the embedding procedure @xcite , using eqs .",
    "( [ barredslice ] ) and ( [ whslice ] ) , one deduces that @xmath33 which implies @xmath34    therefore , we see that the relation between the embedding space at any time @xmath35 and the initial embedding space at @xmath36 , from eqs .",
    "( [ coef2:phi ] ) and ( [ embed : relation ] ) , is given by the following @xmath37\\,.\\ ] ] relative to the @xmath25 coordinate system the wormhole will always remain the same size , as the scaling of the embedding space compensates for the evolution of the wormhole .",
    "however , the wormhole will change size relative to the initial @xmath36 embedding space .",
    "writing the analog of the `` flaring out condition '' @xcite for the evolving wormhole we have @xmath38 , at or near the throat . from eqs .",
    "( [ coef1:phi ] ) , ( [ coef2:phi ] ) , ( [ bar : b ] ) , and ( [ barredembedding ] ) , it follows that @xmath39 at or near the throat , where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "note that this also implies @xmath40 , at or near the throat .",
    "taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ coef1:phi ] ) , ( [ bar : b ] ) , and @xmath41 , one may rewrite the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ barred : flareout ] ) relative to the barred coordinates as @xmath42 or @xmath43 at or near the throat .",
    "one verifies that using the barred coordinates , the flaring out condition eq .",
    "( [ barred : flareout2 ] ) , has the same form as for the static wormhole .",
    "thus , it can be shown that metric ( [ metn ] ) represents a traversable wormhole provided@xmath44where @xmath45 is the wormhole throat , which represents a minimum radius in the wormhole space - time @xcite .",
    "the second condition is imposed in order to avoid a change in the metric signature .",
    "the third condition is the flaring - out condition and plays a fundamental role in the analysis of the violation of the energy conditions .",
    "note that the comoving radial distance defined by @xmath46should be real and finite everywhere in spite of the fact that the @xmath47-component of the covariant metric diverges at the throat ; the @xmath48 signs denote the upper and lower parts of the wormhole .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 , so that using the einstein field equations and eq .",
    "( [ metn ] ) , the ( @xmath54)dimensional field equations are satisfied by the following stress - energy profile @xmath55where the overdot denotes a derivative with respect to time .",
    "the ricci scalar will play a fundamental role in our analysis , so we write it down explicitly as @xmath56since the ricci scalar is only a function of time in standard cosmological models , it provides a motivation to use this property as a simplifying assumption in our calculations , in the presence of a wormhole . in other words",
    ", we are looking for classes of solutions corresponding to the choice of a homogeneous ricci scalar , i.e. , @xmath57 , which implies @xmath58    the above differential equation yields the following solution @xmath59where the condition @xmath60 was used to eliminate the integration constant .",
    "we point out that although @xmath61 can , in principle , be a continuous variable , we have used the fact that the space - time is asymptotically frw and applied the normalization @xmath62 for the curvature constant .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that it is common to consider static wormholes supported by radiation that have a traceless stress - energy tensor @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the ricci scalar vanishes if there is no cosmological constant within the framework of gr .",
    "our assumption leads to the same situation , if the scale factor is assumed to be independent of time , i.e. , for a static case .",
    "as mentioned before , the dimensionless shape function @xmath12 should satisfy the conditions ( [ 3 - 3 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that for @xmath63 and @xmath64 these conditions are satisfied whereas for @xmath65 they are not .",
    "therefore we continue our discussions using @xmath63 and @xmath64 which present flat and open universes , respectively .    with @xmath12 in hand , given by eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , one can rewrite the field equations for the spatially flat background ( @xmath63 ) as : @xmath66where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the respective flat background  components given by @xmath69respectively .    for the specific case of the open background ( @xmath70 )",
    ", we have @xmath71where the @xmath72 and @xmath73 components correspond to the `` open background '' , and are given by @xmath74 since our solutions are in a spherically symmetric cosmological background , the components of the stress - energy tensor should be asymptotically independent of @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to see this expected behaviour is obeyed by them .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of a wormhole as pointed out by morris and thorne @xcite is its two - way traversability . in this section",
    ", some proofs will be presented to show that the wormholes discussed in this paper are indeed two - way traversable .",
    "consider a radially moving light signal emitted from a co - moving source .",
    "we assume that the signal is emitted at @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is a co - moving coordinate ) and received by a distant co - moving observer at @xmath77 . using the metric ( [ metn ] ) and eq . ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) for a radial beam , we have @xmath78where @xmath79 is the comoving radial distance defined in eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath80 and @xmath76 can belong to either side of the throat .",
    "it is obvious that the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ 42 ] ) is independent of time .",
    "therefore , the lhs should also be so and a signal which is emitted in an interval @xmath81  should be received in an interval @xmath82  such that ( @xmath83 ) @xmath84since @xmath82  and @xmath85  are very short time intervals , one deduces that @xmath86where @xmath87 is the scale factor at the time of observation , @xmath88 is the scale factor at the time of emission , and @xmath89 is the cosmological redshift .",
    "this shows that the redshift is the same as the cosmological redshift and no extra redshift is caused by the wormhole .",
    "it remains to examine whether the signal ever reaches the throat in a finite time or not .",
    "this will be addressed below .",
    "since @xmath23 is greater than @xmath90 on both sides of the throat , one can not trivially deduce whether the light signal passes through the throat or not using the @xmath23  coordinate .",
    "therefore , we need to transform from the radial coordinate @xmath23 to the comoving radial coordinate @xmath91 in order to analyse this behavior . using eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 1 ] ) , the analysis is more transparent . consider radial motion so that the geodesic equation reads @xmath92and @xmath93equation ( [ 49 ] ) yields the first integral @xmath94equation ( [ 50 ] )",
    "shows that @xmath95 does not undergo a sign change along the path and neither does it vanish .",
    "this shows that the particle or signal continues its path , passes the throat and goes to the other side of the wormhole and therefore the wormhole is two - way traversable .      in order to prove that there is a finite proper distance between a specific point and the throat , eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 1 ] ) should be solved explicitly . for arbitrary @xmath96",
    ", there is no analytical solution for the integral ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , one could obtain @xmath79 in the vicinity of the throat , which is sufficient for our purpose . using the approximate relation @xmath97 , one obtains @xmath98which are clearly finite distances .",
    "therefore , the throat is not located at spatial infinity and a finite time is required to reach it .    we should mention that horizons are theoretical constructs that qualitatively have two main specific properties : first , they are one - way membranes , and second , the corresponding redshift ( as observed by a distant observer ) is infinite .",
    "more precise mathematical details can be found in @xcite .",
    "since it is common to consider the singularities of the metric as candidates of being horizons , one might ask whether the coordinate singularity at the throat forms a horizon . based on the above - mentioned general qualitative features of horizons and according to the results obtained in subsections ( [ sub-51 ] ) and ( [ sub-52 ] ) , it is justified that there is no horizon at or around the throat .",
    "the possibility of the existence of a cosmological horizon , however , depends on the behavior of the scale factor @xmath99 and is not essentially affected by the presence or absence of the wormhole .",
    "one of the properties of normal matter is that it satisfies the energy conditions , in particular , the null energy condition ( nec ) and the weak energy condition ( wec ) .",
    "it was mentioned in the introduction that the matter that supports the static wormhole geometry violates the nec and is therefore denoted ` exotic matter ' .",
    "the nec requires that @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is _ any _ null vector . in terms of the energy density , radial pressure and tangential pressure the nec becomes @xcite @xmath102note that the wec , in addition to the conditions considered above , also imposes a positive energy density , @xmath103 . in what follows ,",
    "we investigate the nec for the wormhole solutions in different expansion regimes .      in the case of a flat background , one can obtain two different solutions for the scale factor @xmath11 by applying the equation of state @xmath104 , given by @xmath105the specific case of @xmath106 represents the inflationary regime . the case of",

    "<S> in this work , we consider the possibility of expanding wormholes in higher - dimensions , which is an important ingredient of modern theories of fundamental physics . </S>",
    "<S> an important motivation is that non - trivial topological objects such as microscopic wormholes may have been enlarged to macroscopic sizes in an expanding inflationary cosmological background . </S>",
    "<S> since the ricci scalar is only a function of time in standard cosmological models , we use this property as a simplifying assumption . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we consider a particular class of wormhole solutions corresponding to the choice of a spatially homogeneous ricci scalar . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of obtaining solutions with normal and exotic matter is explored and we find a variety of solutions including those in four dimensions that satisfy the null energy condition ( nec ) in specific time intervals . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for five dimensions , we find solutions that satisfy the nec throughout the respective evolution . </S>"
