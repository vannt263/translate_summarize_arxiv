    "the present impact crater size frequency distribution , n is the result , on one hand , of a rate of crater formation , @xmath0 , and , on the other hand , the elimination of craters , as time goes by , due to effects like erosion and obliteration .",
    "therefore if we want to understand the crater formation history we will need to know how these forming and erasing factors combine to create @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in this work the above problem is analyzed , and in section 2 we find that n can be expressed in terms of @xmath0 and the fractional reduction of craters per unit of time , c. then , a simple model is discussed that describe the crater size distribution in mars data , collected by barlow @xcite , where it is assumed that @xmath0 is independent of time .",
    "the above model is realistic , since according to several investigations @xmath0 has remained nearly constant for the last 3 to 3.5 billion years @xcite .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this model implies that @xmath0 and @xmath2 are given as the following inverse power of the diameter , @xmath3 , of the crater : @xmath4 , @xmath5 . in section 3 the model",
    "is applied to craters data on earths , and it is concluded that also in our planet @xmath5 .",
    "this result is interpreted to mean that on mars and earth we have @xmath6 , or equivalently the crater mean life @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "investigations of geometric properties of martian impact craters reflect values of the average height @xmath9 consistent with the above conclusion .",
    "in what follows we will present theoretical and analytical curves which will reproduce the essential features of the martian crater - size frequency distribution empirical curves ( figure 1 ) , based on barlow s ( 1987 ) @xmath10 of about 42,000 impact craters .",
    "the models will be derived using reasonable simple assumptions , that will allow us to relate the present crater population with the crater population at each particular epoch .    to this end , let @xmath11 represents the number of craters of diameter @xmath12 formed during the epoch @xmath13 , where we are assuming that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are sufficiently large that is justified treating @xmath16 as a statistical continuous function , but , on the other hand , they should be sufficiently small ( @xmath17,@xmath18 ) to be able to treat them as differentials in the following discussion . this initial population will change as time goes on due to climatic and geological erosion , and the obliteration of old craters by the formation of new ones .",
    "then , we expect that the change in @xmath19 during a time interval @xmath20 will be proportional to itself and @xmath20 :    @xmath21    where c is the factor that takes into account the depletion of the craters , and should be a function of the diameter , since the smaller a crater is the most likely it will disappear . furthermore , c could also depend on time however , we will ignore such changes here , which we believe is a good starting approximation to the general problem .",
    "it is easy to integrate equation ( 1 ) in time to obtain :    @xmath22,\\ ] ]    @xmath23    equation ( 2 ) gives the number of craters , as a function of @xmath3 , observed at time t , that were produced at the time interval @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the total contribution to the present ( t=0 ) population due to all the epochs @xmath25 is :    @xmath26,\\ ] ]    or in the continuous limit @xmath27 ,    @xmath28 \\,d{\\tau},\\ ] ]    where    @xmath29    @xmath30 is the rate of crater formation of diameter @xmath3 at the epoch @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the total time of crater formation .    in the next section",
    "we will determine the function @xmath33 and @xmath0 for a model where we assumed that the rate of crater formation , @xmath0 , is independent of @xmath31 .",
    "investigations of the time dependance of cratering rate of meteorites have concluded @xcite that the impact rate went through a heavy bombardment era that decayed exponentially until about 3 to 3.5 gy , and since then has remained nearly constant until the present .",
    "therefore , for surfaces that are younger than 3 to 3.5 gy we can reasonably assume that @xmath0 is independent of @xmath31 , and hence from equation ( 5 ) immediately obtain    @xmath34.\\ ] ]    we then find that the simplest model that essentially reproduces the data in figure 1 , for @xmath35 km , is given by equations ( 8)and ( 9 ) :    @xmath36    @xmath37    we see that the theoretical curve ( 7 ) , shown in figure(2 ) , differs significantly from the observed curves for @xmath3 less than about 6 km .",
    "however , according to barlow @xcite the empirical data is undercounting the actual crater population for @xmath3 less than @xmath38 km , and therefore no meaningful comparison is then possible between models and data for this region of small craters .    equation ( 2 ) implies that the fraction of craters of diameter @xmath3 formed at each epoch @xmath31 that still survive at the present time @xmath39 is given by : @xmath40\\,\\approx\\,{\\rm exp}\\left[{-\\left(\\frac{57}{d}\\right)}^{2.5}\\,\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_f } \\right]\\ ] ]    and thus we have that the mean life for craters of diameter @xmath3 , @xmath41 , is    @xmath42    hence , craters with @xmath43 57 km have @xmath44 , while    @xmath45    the region @xmath46 km is approximately described by the limit of equation ( 7 ) when @xmath47 :    @xmath48    which corresponds to a straight line of slope -4.3 in a log n vs log d plot , and that would be the form of equation ( 7 ) in the absence of erosion and obliterations ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "hence , we have that the bending of the empirical curve ( figure 1 ) for @xmath50 is explained in this model as the result of the elimination of smaller craters as they get older .",
    "we also see from equations(13 ) that when the effect of @xmath2 can be ignored we have @xmath51 , and therefore the actual crater density @xmath1 is proportional to the age of the underlying surface @xmath32 . on the other hand , when for smaller craters @xmath52\\,<<\\,1 $ ] we will have from ( 7 ) that    @xmath53    and in this limit the crater density @xmath54 is proportional to the survival mean life , @xmath41 , of the craters of size @xmath3 .",
    "thus , when saturation occurs and hence n is independent of @xmath32 , we have , instead , that @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "this feature is called by hartmann @xcite``crater retention age '' , and in mars this effect shows , according to this model , in craters smaller than about 57 km .",
    "the model given by equations ( 7 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) assumed a simple polynomial form for @xmath0 and @xmath2 , however , alternative models can be also considered .",
    "for instance , by assuming that    @xmath55,\\ ] ]    we will reproduce the mars crater data , exactly as in model given by equations ( 7),(8),(9 ) but now with @xmath56 , and the change in slope in figure ( 1 ) around @xmath57 km will now be interpreted as intrinsic behavior of @xmath58 rather than due to the erosion and obliteration of smaller craters .",
    "how can we then discriminate between these two alternative views ? .",
    "we see that in the model given by equation ( 7 ) the fraction of craters of a given diameter , @xmath3 , produced at a time @xmath31 , decreases with time according to equation ( 10 ) as    @xmath59,\\ ] ]    while in the model of equation ( 15 ) this fraction is independent of time . therefore we can put to test the validity of equation ( 16 ) by studying crater size frequency distributions as a function of time .",
    "this is possible to do in our planet , and in this section we will investigate the consistency of the hypothesis ( 16 ) with the earth craters data .    thus consider the average diameter of craters observed today that were formed during a given time @xmath60 , which is given , according to equation ( 16 ) , by    @xmath61    assuming that @xmath2 and @xmath0 behave in the form    @xmath62    @xmath63    we can rewrite equation ( 17 ) in the form ( appendix )    @xmath64    where    @xmath65    and    @xmath66    is the gamma function",
    ". equation ( 20 ) can be rewritten as    @xmath67    which represents a linear relation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 with slope @xmath70 . in figure ( 3 ) we plot @xmath71 vs @xmath69 from data of crater size vs @xmath31 on earth , and the straight line best fitting gives @xmath72 , which is the value determined for model ( 7 ) for mars .",
    "this result is interpreted as follows .",
    "if we assume that , as expected , @xmath73 is a function of the volume of the crater , @xmath74 , that decreases with decreasing @xmath74 , then it is reasonable to expand it in terms of powers of @xmath75 , and thus we will have    @xmath76    furthermore , for sufficiently small volumes we would have , as a good approximation to @xmath2 , that    @xmath77    where we are writing    @xmath78    with @xmath79 as the average height of the crater of size @xmath3 .",
    "the comparison of equation ( 25 ) with equations ( 19 ) , with @xmath80 , imply that    @xmath81    which is a prediction that can be investigated , and we have found that indeed equation ( 27 ) is consistent with results from studies of impact crater geometric properties on the surface of mars , by j.b .",
    "garrin @xcite .",
    "therefore it appears that the age distribution of craters on earth favor the simple model considered for mars , where there is an erosion and obliteration factor @xmath2 with the approximate form    @xmath82    it is also suggested here that the above behavior for @xmath2 follows from a relation of the form    @xmath83    with    @xmath84    further investigations and observations of the crater data on the terrestrial planets , the moon and the asteroids are necessary for additional tests of the validity of the model ( 7 ) and its interpretation .",
