    "thermoelectric ( te ) devices for clean , environmentally - friendly cooling and power generation are a topic of considerable research activity .",
    "@xcite the te figure of merit , determining the efficiency of a te device , is defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the seebeck coefficient ( also known as thermopower ) , @xmath6 is electrical conductivity , @xmath7 is thermal conductivity , and @xmath8 is the operating temperature .",
    "highly doped semiconductors are the materials with the highest @xmath3 , because heat in semiconductors is carried mostly by the lattice ( @xmath9 ) , so electronic and thermal transport are largely decoupled ; therefore , the power factor , @xmath10 , and thermal conductivity can , in principle , be separately optimized .",
    "@xcite in order to improve @xmath3 , we need to increase the power factor and reduce thermal conductivity .",
    "@xmath11 is needed to replace conventional chlorofluorocarbon coolers by te coolers , but increasing it beyond @xmath12 has been a challenge.@xcite    nanostructuring has the potential to both enhance the power factor and reduce the thermal conductivity of te devices.@xcite the seebeck coefficient and the power factor could be higher in nanostructured te devices than in bulk owing to the density - of - states ( dos ) modification , as first suggested by hicks and dresselhaus .",
    "@xcite while this effect is expected to be quite pronounced in thin nanowires ( nws ) , where the dos is highly peaked around one - dimensional ( 1d ) subband energies , @xcite surface roughness scattering ( srs ) of charge carriers counters the beneficial dos enhancement.@xcite the field effect has also been shown to enhance the power factor in nanostructures , @xcite as it provides carrier confinement and charge density control without the detrimental effects of carrier - dopant scattering . moreover , nanostructured obstacles efficiently quench heat conduction , as demonstrated on materials with nanoscale inclusions of various sizes,@xcite which scatter phonons of different wavelengths , and on rough semiconductor nanowires , in which boundary roughness scattering of phonons reduces lattice thermal conductivity by nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "@xcite    power generation based on te energy harvesting requires materials that have high thermoelectric efficiency and thermal stability at high temperatures , as well as chemical stability in oxide environments .",
    "@xcite bulk iii - nitrides fulfill these criteria and have been receiving attention as potential high - temperature te materials .",
    "@xcite bulk gan , in particular , has excellent electron mobility , but , like other tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors , it also has high thermal conductivity,@xcite so its overall te performance is very modest ( @xmath13 at 300 k and @xmath14 at 1000 k , as reported by liu and balandin @xcite ) . recently ,",
    "sztein _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that alloying with small amounts of in can considerably enhance the te performance of bulk gan . here , we explore a different scenario : considering that nanostructuring ,",
    "in particular fabrication of quasi-1d systems such as nws , has been shown to raise the @xmath3 of other semiconductors , @xcite it is worth asking how well gan nws could perform in high - temperature te applications .",
    "@xcite there have been a number of advances in the gan nw growth and fabrication , @xcite as well as their electronic characterization , @xcite but very few studies of gan nws for te applications.@xcite    in this paper , we theoretically investigate the suitability of rough @xmath15-type gan nws for high - temperature te applications .",
    "to that end , we simulate their electronic , thermal , and te properties over a wide range of thicknesses ( 39 nm ) , doping densities ( @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath2 ) , and temperatures ( 3001000 k ) .",
    "electronic transport is simulated using ensemble monte carlo ( emc ) coupled with a self - consistent schrdinger ",
    "poisson solver . the electronic seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity",
    "are calculated by solving the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) under the relaxation - time approximation ( rta ) .",
    "lattice thermal conductivity is calculated using a phonon ensemble monte carlo simulation , with a real - space rough surface described by a gaussian autocorrelation function . throughout the temperature range , the seebeck coefficient increases while the lattice thermal conductivity decreases with decreasing wire cross section . at room temperature these benefits",
    "are eventually overcome by the detrimental effect of srs on the electron mobility , so the peak @xmath16 is achieved at 4 nm , with further downscaling lowering the @xmath3 . at 1000 k , however , the electron mobility varies very weakly with the nw thickness owing to the dominance of polar optical phonon scattering and multiple subbands contributing to transport , so @xmath3 keeps increasing with increasing confinement , reaching 0.8 for 3-nm - thick nws at 1000 k and for optimal doing .",
    "the @xmath3 of gan nws increases with temperature past 1000 k , which highlights their suitability for high - temperature te applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the model used to calculate the electron scattering rates is explained in sec . [",
    "sec : electronic ] , followed by a discussion of the simulation results for the electron mobility ( sec .",
    "[ sec : mobility ] ) and the seebeck coefficient ( sec .",
    "[ sec : seebeck ] ) as a function of wire thickness , doping density , and temperature . in section",
    "[ sec : thermal ] , we discuss the phonon scattering models used in this paper and then show the calculated values of phononic and electronic thermal conductivity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zt ] , we show the calculation of the thermoelectric figure of merit and discuss its behavior .",
    "we conclude with a summary and final remarks in sec . [",

    "bulk gan can crystalize in zincblende or wurtzite structures , the latter being more abundant . in bulk",
    "wurtzite gan , the bottom of the conduction band is located at the @xmath17 point .",
    "the next lowest valley , located at @xmath18 , is about 1.2 ev higher than @xmath17 , @xcite so it does not contribute to low - field electron transport .",
    "the electron band structure in the @xmath17-valley can be approximated as non - parabolic , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ev@xmath21 is the non - parabolicity factor and @xmath22 is the isotropic electron effective mass , @xcite given in the units of @xmath23 , the free - electron rest mass .",
    "wurtzite gan nws are usually grown @xcite or etched vertically , @xcite along the bulk crystalline _ c_-axis , and can have triangular , hexagonal , or quasi - circular cross - sections , depending on the details of processing.@xcite in silicon , simulation of electronic transport in rough cylindrical , square , and atomistically realistic nanowires yields results that are remarkably close to one another , both qualitatively and quantitatively , when these differently shaped wires have similar cross - sectional feature size and similar edge roughness features ; for instance , the electron mobility in a rough cylindrical wire of diameter equal to 8 nm @xcite is very close to the mobility in a square nw with an 8-nm side.@xcite therefore , in order to simplify the numerical simulation of electron and phonon transport in gan nws , we consider a square cross section , with the understanding that the wire thickness or width stands in for a generic characteristic cross - sectional feature size .    in the",
    "_ n_-type doped square gan nws considered here , electrons are confined to a square quantum well in the cross - sectional plane and are free to move along the wire axis . in the envelope function approximation ,",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) electron wave functions have the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) wavefunction of the @xmath15-th 2d subband calculated from the schrdinger - poisson solver .",
    "the corresponding electron energy is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the bottom - of - subband energy .",
    "the 2d poisson s and schrdinger equations are solved in a self - consistent loop : poisson s equation gives the hartree approximation for the electrostatic potential , which is used in the schrdinger equation to calculate electronic wave functions and energies in the cross - sectional plane ; electronic subbands are then populated to calculate the carrier density and fed back into the poisson solver .",
    "more details regarding the numerical procedure can be found in refs . .",
    "electrons in gan nws scatter from acoustic phonons , impurities , surface roughness , polar optical phonons ( pop ) , and the piezoelectric ( pz ) field .",
    "@xcite gan nws have only a few monolayers of native oxide around them ; @xcite therefore , for the purpose of srs , we will treat them as bare ( i.e. surrounded by air ) .",
    "the scattering rates are calculated using fermi s golden rule .",
    "@xcite the constants used in the scattering rate calculations are taken from refs . , and shown in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    ".gan material parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     surface roughness scattering is often modeled using the rta and a specularity parameter that accounts for diffuse scattering at the surface .",
    "@xcite here , we have accounted for srs more realistically by generating a rough surface with specific rms roughness and correlation length .",
    "@xcite when a phonon hits the rough surface , it will reflect specularly at the point of impact ; this approach is reminiscent of ray - tracing ( see , for instance , refs . ) .",
    "the phonon can undergo multiple reflections before it returns inside the wire ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "we used a quadratic dispersion relationship , @xmath28 , fitted to the experimental data of ref .",
    ", for transverse and longitudinal bulk phonons .",
    "the quadratic dispersion is quite accurate in wurtzite gan , as shown , for example , by ma _",
    "et al_.@xcite @xmath29 is the the sound velocity ( i.e. the phonon group velocity at the @xmath17 point ) .",
    "the material parameters are listed in table [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "+   +    figure [ fig : fig10 ] shows thermal conductivity as a function of temperature and wire thickness , for rms roughness of 0.3 nm and a correlation length of 2.5 nm . for these roughness parameters , thermal conductivity in gan nws shows a reduction by a factor of 20 with respect to bulk at 300 k , which emphasizes the dominance of srs in phonon transport over other processes .",
    "the slight waviness in the 1000 k in fig .",
    "10b is of numerical origin ; with increasing temperature the number of real phonons represented by one numerical phonon increases rapidly , which affects accuracy . while the error bars on the 300 k data are too small to be visible , the 1000 k values are of order a few percent ( figure [ fig : fig10]b ) .",
    "using the calculated electron mobility , seebeck coefficient , and lattice thermal conductivity , we compute the te figure of merit .",
    "figure [ fig : fig11 ] shows the variation of room - temperature @xmath3 as a function of wire thickness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11a ] ) , doping density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11b ] ) , and temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11c ] ) .",
    "the highest room - temperature @xmath3 values in gan nws of approximately 0.2 are two - orders - of - magnitude greater than the bulk @xmath3 value of 0.0017 reported by liu and balandin , @xcite an increase that stems both from the thermal conductivity reduction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10b ] ) and the seebeck coefficient increase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8b ] ) with decreasing wire thickness .",
    "wires with characteristic cross - sectional features of about 4 nm have the highest @xmath3 values at room temperature ; the decrease in @xmath3 with further reduction in thickness comes from the overall detrimental effect of srs on the electron mobility , which overshadows the beneficial effects of thermal conductivity reduction and @xmath30 increase .    in contrast , at 1000 k , the transport window contains multiple subbands and pop scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism , so the electron mobility is nearly independent of both thickness and doping density . as a result , the @xmath3 of gan nws continues to increase with decreasing thickness , and reaches 0.8 in 3-nm - thick gan nws for the @xmath31 @xmath2 doping density .",
    "( for wires thinner than 3 nm , changes in the phonon dispersion and electronic band structure become considerable and atomistic approaches ought to be employed,@xcite which may quantitatively change the te figure of merit . )",
    "the @xmath3 of gan nws continues to rise with increasing temperature beyond 1000 k , which should ensure efficient energy harvesting with these devices up to high temperatures .",
    "we presented a comprehensive computational study of the electronic , thermal , and thermoelectric properties of gan nws over a broad range of thicknesses , doping densities , and temperatures .    at room temperature ,",
    "srs of electrons in thin gan nws competes with polar optical phonon scattering , and results in a decrease of the electron mobility with decreasing thickness .",
    "roughness also decreases thermal conductivity in thin wires , which is beneficial in thermoelectric applications .",
    "reduced wire thickness improves the seebeck coefficient , which is considerably higher in thin wires over in bulk , owing to the combined effects of the 1d subband density - of - states and the increasing subband separation that follows a reduction in the wire cross section .",
    "cumulatively , reducing the wire cross - sectional features down to 4 nm results in the room - temperature @xmath3 increasing , with a maximum of 0.2 obtained for wires of 4-nm thickness doped to @xmath31 @xmath2 , a two - orders - of - magnitude increase over bulk .",
    "below 4 nm , the room - temperature @xmath3 does not improve with further confinement , as the detrimental surface - roughness - scattering of electrons and the drop in mobility win over the beneficial effects that confinement has on the seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity .    at high temperatures , the highest in this study being 1000",
    "k , the electron mobility flattens as a function of thickness , as many subbands start to contribute to transport and pop scattering wins over the temperature - insensitive srs .",
    "the seebeck coefficient is higher at 1000 k than at 300 k and increases with decreasing wire thickness , although less dramatically than at lower temperatures , while thermal conductivity beneficially decreases with increased confinement .",
    "overall , at 1000 k the thermoelectric figure of merit increases with increasing confinement ( i.e. decreasing nw thickness ) , reaching a value of 0.8 for 3 nm wires .",
    "the @xmath3 of gan nws continues to increase with the temperature increasing beyond 1000 k , owing to the negligible minority carrier generation across the large gap , which underscores the suitability of these structures for high - temperature energy - harvesting applications .",
    "extrapolation of the trend would yield @xmath32 at 2000 k for 4-nm - thick nws .",
    "further improvements in @xmath3 might be achieved by additional alloy scattering of phonons by introducing in , as demonstrated in ref . .",
    "combined with nanostructuring , ingan nws might prove to be a particularly interesting choice for high - temperature power generation .",
