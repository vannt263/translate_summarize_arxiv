    "studies of various properties of graphene and its applications have attracted much attention in the last years , as it is well - known @xcite . in this paper , it is proposed for an approach based on the use of closed clusters ( cc ) to calculate the energy band structure of graphene .",
    "we have developed this approach earlier in application to the one - dimensional and three - dimensional crystals with diamond structures @xcite .",
    "the essence of the cc approach is to bring together all bonds of atoms which are located on the edge of a cluster in order to eliminate the `` dangling '' bonds .",
    "this approach is found to be especially useful for calculation of the energy spectrum of crystals with point defects , such as vacancies or impurity atoms . the simplest and most widespread approach to calculate such impurity states",
    "is known to be the effective mass method .",
    "this approximation works sufficiently well in cases of impurity levels being located along the borders of the energy zones .",
    "however , it is inapplicable to the description of so - called `` deep levels '' , which lie far from the zone borders @xcite .",
    "one of the methods used for those levels is the cluster approach , in which a group of atoms - the cluster - is mentally picked from a crystal lattice .",
    "this cluster is considered as a separate `` molecule '' and for its calculation the usual quantum chemistry methods are applied .",
    "the advantage of the clusters approach is its applicability for modelling real situations of impurity atoms and - if necessary - taking into consideration a possible distortion of the crystal lattice .",
    "however , the usual cluster approach has a deficiency . is the `` infinity '' crystal substituted by a group of atoms , a problem with atoms lying on the edge of the cluster arises .",
    "the presence of such atoms with torn bonds distorts the energy spectrum of the crystal .",
    "this distortion can be diminished by increasing the size of the cluster , but the approximation to the exact value is very slow .",
    "this deficiency can instead be removed by connecting the torn bonds with each other and hereby closing them . a similar procedure , the so - called `` periodical boundary conditions '' , is applied in studying the energy spectrum of the infinite ideal crystals .",
    "the special feature of our approach is the application the closing procedure of these bonds to small clusters to study crystals with distorted regularity properties ( such as impurity , edges and other ) . in this paper ,",
    "the cc approach is applied to graphene , a relatively new material with numerous of unique properties @xcite . in section[sec : essence ] the fundamental idea of the cc approach is presented as well as the rules for the construction of diagrams corresponding to the various clusters . in section[sec : ham ] examples of building hamiltonian matrices and solutions for the secular equations in case of periodical structures without edges and defects are given .",
    "the aim of this section is to test our approach by means of comparison of the results with those obtained by other methods . in section[sec : bilayer graphene ] the cc approach is applied to bilayer graphene . in section[sec : wave functions ] we present wave functions at symmetry points of the brillouin zone . in section[sec : nanoribbons and nanotubes ] we study nanoribbons and nanotubes by means of closed clusters .",
    "section[sec : impurity ] contains the calculations of the graphene energy spectrum in the presence of impurity .",
    "finally , in [ sec : monoatomic layer ] we study the energy band structure of the hypothetic monoatomic layer c@xmath0 si@xmath1 @xmath3 .",
    "section[sec : con ] concludes with a discussion of the obtained results and furthermore describes a possibility for making the approach more precise as well as the application of the cc approach to other problems .",
    "by the term `` closed cluster '' we mean a group of n atoms which reflects the structure of the crystal and furthermore the atom bonds which are present within the group - at the same time the torn bonds are absent .",
    "a similar procedure of closing the bonds known as  periodical boundary conditions is often used in one - dimensional atom chains when atom n+1 is identical to the first one .",
    "such a procedure is also possible for 3d - systems , but is rarely applied here , since closing a 3d cluster is much more difficult . in 2d cases",
    "however , closing can be realized very easily - therefore , application of the cc approach to graphene and other 2d structures seems to be very effective .    while constructing clusters corresponding to graphene one must start out from its crystal structure .",
    "the latter is well - known , a hexagonal layer which is formed by two sublattices , here a and b @xcite .",
    "the simplest unclosed cluster corresponding to such a structure is shown in fig.[fig1a ] .",
    "the main idea of the closed cluster approach is the necessity of closing the torn bonds shown in fig.[fig1a ] in the way shown in fig.[fig1b ] . in case of an endless graphene layer",
    "the structure of the lattice requires the following rules regarding the construction of a closed cluster with approximation of the nearest neighbors .",
    "* * _ rule 1 .",
    "_ * each atom of sublattice a is bonded with three atoms of sublattice b and vice versa . * * _ rule 2 .",
    "_ * all real and closing bonds have the same energy levels . * * _ rule 3 . _",
    "* the number of atoms in a cluster n must be divisible by six .",
    "the last rule is explained in detail in section[sec : wave functions ] .",
    "all three rules in fact are satisfied within the construction in fig.[fig1b ] , although the second rule seems to be broken at first sight : for example , the closing bond between atoms 1 and 4 looks different from that between 1 - 2 or 1 - 6 , since atom 4 is further away from 1 .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that the bond 1 - 4 is not a real bond . in distinction from fig.[fig1c ] , the closed cluster 1(b ) must be understood as a diagram or graph , which makes it easier to obtain the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "furthermore , if these hamiltonian matrix elements corresponding to the closing bonds are chosen the same as for existing bonds , then the `` interaction '' between atoms like 1 and 4 in 1(b ) in fact describes the interaction between 1 and 1 in 1(c ) , latter of which is absent in cluster @xmath4 .",
    "it must be noted , that for the numbers of atoms in sublattices a and b it is necessary to be equal , as closing bonds is only possible between atoms of different sublattices .",
    "for example , in cluster 1(b ) it is only possible to close the bonds of atom 1 with atom 4 , but not with 3 or 5 .",
    "this restriction is necessary to satisfy rule 1 .",
    "we also note that energy values obtained from the solution of secular equations are independent from the choice of the cluster in case of an `` infinite '' ideal lattice , but are only dependent from the number n. they are as well independent from the numeration of the atoms , since changes in numeration only cause determinant permutations .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows some of the possible clusters with @xmath5 with dissimilar ways of closing .    to conclude this section , we note , that the name `` closed cluster '' which we use is different from the term `` closed walk '' used in graph theory @xcite .",
    "for example , the cluster shown in fig.[fig1a ] is a `` closed walk '' , but not a closed cluster - the latter is shown in fig.[fig1b ] .",
    "one definition of a closed cluster can be given as a cluster , where each atom is linked to the same number of neighbor atoms as in the corresponding crystal .",
    "the basic idea underlying the cc approach is the same as in the usual molecular orbital approach ( mo ) @xcite . in particular , this is the representation of the wave function of the cluster @xmath6 as a linear combination of the wave functions of the atoms @xmath7    functions @xmath8 in graphene are @xmath9 - orbitals of carbon atoms , with axis z being perpendicular to the layer .",
    "we designate wave functions along and opposed this axis as `` + '' and `` - '' .",
    "the standard procedure of obtaining secular equations leads to a system of linear equations which help to find the coefficients @xmath10 in @xmath11    where @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    with    @xmath16 - energy of an electron    @xmath17 - energy of an electron in the @xmath18 state in an isolated carbon atom .",
    "we use @xmath19    and    @xmath20 - the transfer integral between neighbor atoms with wave functions with the same sign , @xmath21 .    the problem of calculating the corresponding values of energy @xmath22 ( in @xmath23 units )",
    "is then reduced to solving the secular equation @xmath24    now we consider some examples of applications of the approach .",
    "we begin with the simplest closed cluster @xmath4 , which is shown in fig.[fig1b ] .",
    "the secular equation ( 4 ) has the form ( empty matrix cells standing here and further for zeroes ) : + @xmath25    calculating the determinant leads to the following equation for finding @xmath22 : @xmath26    the solutions of @xmath273,0,0,0,0 are exactly those energy values at bottom , top and dirac points of two energy bands , which are obtained from a tight binding and nearest neighbor approximations [ 5 ] .",
    "the fact , that the cc approach provides exact values of energy band boundaries already at a minimal cluster size is very important in the calculation of the energy of impurity states , as the energy of such states are counted from the bands boundaries .",
    "let us consider the next example with @xmath5 . if we proceed from the clusters from fig.[fig2",
    "] , then the secular equation has the form +    @xmath28     + the solution of equation is given by following values of energy @xmath22 : @xmath29 .",
    "the determinant of cluster n=24 has a form which is analogous to @xmath30 .",
    "the obtained energy values are shown in table[table1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table5 ]    the relation between @xmath31 and @xmath32 in table[table5 ] can be written as    @xmath33    this formula differs from @xmath34 in @xcite , which is maybe due to the different definition of the ribbon width in @xcite .",
    "figure shows the dependence between the energy gap @xmath35 and the ribbon width .",
    "here it is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the nearest level to zero and is found via .     and the ribbon width . ]",
    "the values of @xmath38 and l , where @xmath39 are not marked , they can be obtained from equations and .",
    "this described approach of the calculation of nanoribbons by the means of ladder clusters may also be applied to nanotubes , with some modifications .",
    "the formal transition from the nanoribbon to the nanotube consists in closing a cluster of the type shown in fig.[fig7b ] , so that closing happens between atoms 1 - 6 and 7 - 12 - this way we get the cluster from , fig.[fig2b ] .",
    "if we wrap it up into a cylinder form , we obtain a cluster with three hexagons .",
    "it can be easily verified that in clusters of this type the number of hexagons in the cylinder section is always an integer .",
    "however , a cluster of type as in fig.[fig8 ] can not be wrapped up in such a way , because the atoms of the upper and lower edge are from the same sublattice , a or b - and nearest neighbors always have to be from different sublattices .",
    "therefore , in order to wrap up a cluster into a cylinder one must add a row of atoms .",
    "these atoms need to belong to a different sublattice than the atoms at the edges of the initial cluster . in an @xmath40 example",
    "this means that the number @xmath41 of atoms situated along the circle cylinder section must equal six .",
    "it may also be easily verified that for clusters of both types @xmath41 must be even ( which is a consequence of the equal number of a and b atoms ) and the number of hexagons @xmath42 along the circle has to be an integer .",
    "hereat , beginning with the smallest value @xmath43 it is @xmath44 .",
    "in case of metallic conductivity ( @xmath45 ) as well as in the infinite layer ( section[sec : wave functions ] ) , it is necessary for @xmath41 to contain an integer number of atomic triplets @xmath46 , that is , @xmath41 needs to be not only even but also divisible by three . all in all @xmath47 has to be divisible by six , and therefore we can write the criterion of metallic conductivity of nanotubes as    @xmath48    for all other values of @xmath41 there is @xmath49 .",
    "for example , in case of the least values @xmath50 one must consider the closed cluster @xmath51 .",
    "it is possible to calculate a cluster of type from figure [ fig2b ] , but for @xmath51 .",
    "solving equation for this case gives us the following energy spectrum :    @xmath52    hence , the value of the energy gap for @xmath53 is @xmath54 , which is the maximum value of @xmath55 for nanotubes . with an increasing @xmath41 the value of @xmath55 decreases .",
    "it should be noted , that @xmath56 in and @xmath55 are scaled by @xmath57 : @xmath58 , where @xmath57 is the tube s transfer integral ( hopping energy ) .",
    "this latter value is different from the value of @xmath23 for the infinite layer and is dependent from @xmath41 , which should be taken into the account when @xmath59 in @xmath60 needs to be obtained .",
    "however , this dependence does not exert any influence on the criterion @xmath39 .",
    "the cluster approach is , as already mentioned , especially appropriate for studying the impurities in crystals .",
    "that is connected with the fact that the impurity influence on the crystal depends mainly on the interaction with atoms , which are located in the nearest environment of this impurity .",
    "exactly those atoms together with the impurity are the ones which can be considered as a cluster with n atoms .",
    "the study of this cluster is the essence of the impurity problem in the present approach .    in this paper",
    "we restrict the consideration to the simplest cluster @xmath4 .",
    "let us assume , that in the first lattice point of this cluster atom c is substituted by another one .",
    "this atom only differs from c in terms of the @xmath9-electron energy of an isolated atom , which is @xmath61 instead of just @xmath17 .",
    "it is also assumed , that this impurity atom is silicon , although is also might be germanium or any other atom with the same outer electron shell structure as c. furthermore , we assume the transfer integral @xmath23 equal between all neighbor atoms . in order to account for the difference in these parameters within the cluster approach , one simply has to replace the ones in the corresponding hamiltonian matrix elements with parameters , which characterize the transfer integral between the impurity and the surrounding atoms .",
    "the issue of the influence of these parameters on the energy spectrum in 3d crystals has been investigated by us earlier by means of green s functions @xcite . for the purpose of this paper , however , this problem is not of a fundamental meaning , in so far as the main parameter is @xmath62 .",
    "an example of a closed cluster with one impurity atom si is shown in fig.[fig11 ] .     with one impurity atom si.,width=86 ]",
    "the secular equation for this cluster has the form    @xmath63    where @xmath64 .",
    "this sixth degree equation is reduced to a cubic equation , which can be solved analytically . as result",
    "we get following solutions    @xmath65,\\\\ & \\textit { } \\quad n=0,1,2\\ldots \\end{aligned } \\label{eq:33}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath66    it is easy to see that under @xmath67 there is    @xmath68    that is we obtain the result . + the numerical calculations of the dependence of @xmath22 from @xmath69 , which may be obtained from and or , simpler , directly from the calculation of the determinant , are shown in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "as one can see , we get a result which is typical for the perturbation process : the fourfold degenerate level @xmath70 splits partially and the non - degenerate level moves . at the same time level",
    "@xmath70 still remains threefold degenerate .",
    "that is why there is no arising gap between the valence and conduction bands .",
    "the level , which is split from the originally fourfold degenerated level @xmath70 is the impurity level in the conduction band , that is the resonance level .",
    "by means of the cc approach one may as well calculate the energy spectrum of a hypothetical object , a monoatomic layer of the type c@xmath0 si@xmath1 . that such an object can be created results from the following reasoning : by obtaining by means of epitaxi",
    ", graphene can be formed on the surface of sic .",
    "the monolayer of si , which appear hereat as a buffer layer , has also a hexagonal structure @xcite .",
    "that is why by means of epitaxi , perhaps not only graphene can be formed but also the monoatomic layer of the type c@xmath0 si@xmath1 @xmath71 , with a hexagonal structure similar to graphene .    in the study of this problem",
    "we restrict ourselves to consider only the simplest structure @xmath4 .",
    "this is found to be sufficient for describing in outline the energy band structure of c@xmath0 si@xmath1 .",
    "we consider the cases separately when in a cluster of 6 c - atoms one , two , three , four or five atoms are replaced by si - atoms .",
    "this corresponds to the values @xmath72 , respectivaly .",
    "the case of @xmath73 has been already considered in the preceding section . it should be noted that under `` impurity '' we mean the atoms which are present in a lesser number .",
    "that is at @xmath74 the impurity atoms are those of si and at @xmath75 those of c.    the clusters , corresponding to these @xmath76-values , can be of two types .",
    "namely , by @xmath74 two impurity si - atoms can interact with each other ( type @xmath77 ) or not interact ( type @xmath78 ) .",
    "the same can be obtained for c - atoms by @xmath75 .",
    "first we study the clusters of type @xmath78 , which are shown in fig.[fig13 ] .",
    "the secular equations for clusters shown in fig.[fig13 ] can easily be estimated .",
    "for example , by @xmath74 we obtain    @xmath79    for other values of @xmath76 the equations have the similar form . in all cases the equations of the sixth degree are to be reduced to equations of the third degree and",
    "are solved analytically .",
    "the results of these calculations are :    @xmath80    @xmath81 are determined by formula , but with other @xmath8 , namely    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84;\\\\ & n=0,1,2\\ldots \\end{aligned } \\label{eq:38}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the same as in    @xmath85;\\\\ \\text{where}\\\\ & \\cos\\varphi=\\frac{\\delta(\\delta^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}3 ^ 4)}{(\\delta^{2}+27)^\\frac{3}{2}};\\\\ & \\textit { } n=0,1,2\\ldots \\end{aligned } \\label{eq:39}\\ ] ]    the dependence of the energy bands of c@xmath0 si@xmath1 on @xmath76 is shown in form of a diagram in fig.[fig14 ] .",
    "this diagram is obtained from formulas , , - for @xmath86 which corresponds roughly to the value of @xmath69 for si in graphene .",
    "checkered : valence band ; striped : conduction band ; plain : forbidden band , width=264,height=434 ]    the main feature of this band structure rises from forbidden band with the typical tunnel form . from this one can suggest , that in principle it is possible to create a tunnel diode on the basis on a c@xmath0 si@xmath1 layer . in the ground of such a diode can be a tunnelling between si- and c - domains of the layer in which the concentration of @xmath76 changes with the coordinate @xmath76 .",
    "that is , if in fig[fig14 ] @xmath76 is not only the concentration , but as well the coordinate @xmath76 .",
    "next we study the clusters of type @xmath77 in which impurity atoms interact not only with basic atoms of the layer but also with each other .",
    "the latter is possible , if the impurities are in the lattice points of different sublattice : a and b , because the atoms of the same sublattice do not interact with each other in the nearest neighbors approximation .    in case of @xmath74",
    "the cluster of type @xmath77 can be obtained from the cluster in fig.[fig13a ] , if place the atoms si in the lattice points , for example 2 and 5 instead of 1 nad 3 .",
    "c - atoms with @xmath75 in the cluster in fig.[fig13c ] can be treated the same way . as a result",
    "we obtain following solutions for clusters of type @xmath77 :    @xmath87    @xmath88    from formulas [ eq:40 ] and [ eq:41 ] one can obtain the energy of impurity states , which at @xmath86 can be found most within valance and conduction bands .",
    "the single level which can be found in the forbidden band appears when @xmath74 .",
    "this level can take part in tunnelling , which we discussed above .",
    "in this paper , the cc approach has been applied to some problems of calculation of the grpahene energy spectrum .",
    "this approach seems to be especially appropriate both for problems of the breach of the graphene s periodical structure ( point defects , boundaries ) and for problems besides monolayer graphene ( bilayer graphene , compound c@xmath0 si@xmath1 ) .    as for the precision of the approach",
    ", it may easily be increased by considering clusters of larger sizes and interaction not only with the nearest neighbors . besides , it is not difficult to study the cluster with a distortion of the lattice near the point defect .",
    "one can also consider the conglomerates of point defects in a graphene lattice .    except various problems with the calculation of electron energy spectrum , the closed cluster approach may as well be applied to calculate of the vibration spectrum in graphene , likewise as it is done for one - dimensional and three - dimensional crystals in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank olga talianska and raisa kociurzynski for the interest and informative support , alexander talyanski for help with the numerical calculations and ludmila swarytsch for the motivation of this work .",
