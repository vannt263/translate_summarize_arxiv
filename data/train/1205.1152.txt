    "<S> we close by summarising the achievements of this work . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that mode - coupling theory adapted to describe non - stationary states captures the key features of the emergence and coarsening of glassy order from a liquid . through the evolution of a three - point function </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the glassy correlation volume grows as @xmath7 with waiting time @xmath1 , slower than domain volumes in conventional coarsening , and the relaxation time of the glass grows as @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> these theoretical growth laws are supported by simulation studies @xcite , and the broad features we observe are similar to those in @xcite . in an experimental realization , </S>",
    "<S> if the quench is below the mct transition but above a putative ideal glass transition at , say , the kauzmann temperature @xmath99 , activated processes @xcite outside the scope of mct should cut off the growth . </S>",
    "<S> presumably a quench below @xmath99 will give indefinite growth of a different glassy length scale @xcite with a form not predicted by mct . in results to be presented separately @xcite we find further that an imposed shear - rate @xmath100 cuts off aging and coarsening at @xmath101 in the glassy region and @xmath102 in the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> since the relaxation time goes as @xmath8 , this should imply that @xmath17 or @xmath44 should vary as @xmath103 . </S>",
