    "these high values are the result of the features seen in the rotation curve around 2.5 kpc that can not be fit by smooth dark matter density profiles",
    ". however , the velocity profiles do follow the overall shape and turnover of the observed rotation curve .",
    "given a candidate dark matter particle with primordial phase space density @xmath4 , any halo with total gravitationally bound mass @xmath26 must have a minimum constant density core radius that scales inversely with the total halo mass as @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this relation follows from dimensional analysis given our assumption that the shape of the density profile only depends on a scale density and scale radius .",
    "it can also be explicitly calculated in the context of the `` excess mass function '' of @xcite , as shown by @xcite .",
    "given the total mass and primordial phase space density , a lower bound on the core size can be placed because entropy increases or , equivalently , because `` phase space density '' decreases .",

    "for the ed4 and th2 models we also list the total mass of the galaxy - halo system , @xmath26 , inferred from the best - fit density profile .",
    "the masses determined in this way are consistent with and only marginally larger than the enclosed mass determined using the last observed rotation curve point .",
    "the ed3 and th1 models formally have divergent masses because of the assumed profile shape at large r and are not listed in table 1 .",
    "the halo parameters presented in table 1 do not seem to obey the @xmath37 scaling relation that is expected if the cores are set by the requirement of no phase - space mixing .",
    "the observed core radii of our galaxy sample span a range of about a factor of ten , which would require a factor of @xmath38 variation in total mass from system to system to be explained by the same primordial phase space density . given that these galaxies are so similar in luminosity and asymptotic rotation speeds ( figure 1 ) , this is highly implausible .",
    "we note that this argument does not rule out the possibility that the underlying dark matter is warm , but only that core sizes are not set by the primordial phase space density of dark matter particles .",
    "in particular , some of the cores could be due to phase - space mixing as a result of mergers , but this makes the attribution of cores to fundamental dark matter physics ambiguous .",
    "in addition , we will show that the values of the primordial phase space density required are much too small to be consistent with constraints arising from the matter power spectrum .    in figure 2 , we present a more detailed comparison of theory and data by plotting the inferred total mass of each galaxy - halo system , @xmath26 , against the measured halo core radii . for clarity",
    "we plot only the results for the early decay @xmath19 and thermal wdm @xmath11 cases .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained for the ed3 and th1 cases if we use @xmath39 rather than @xmath26 and do not modify the conclusions . for each galaxy , we plot the combined range of core radii and masses for the two dark matter models . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the @xmath26 vs. ( minimum ) @xmath9 relationship that is expected for early - decay dark matter for two choices of @xmath4 .",
    "it is immediately obvious from figure 2 that 1 ) the data span a range of only about one order of magnitude in mass , 2 ) the data are not consistent with a single value of @xmath4 , and 3 ) mass and core radius are not anti - correlated as would be expected from equation [ eq : edq ] .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this result in the context of dark matter models is that the cores in these galaxies @xmath40 be set directly by the primordial phase space density of dark matter and therefore must be the result of baryonic processes . if , however , we insist that a wdm model explain these data , then to have a single value of @xmath4 for this sample , galaxies with small cores must preferentially lose more than 2 orders of magnitude in mass , while galaxies with large cores lose very little .",
    "this is highly unlikely in these undisturbed disk galaxies , as feedback from powerful radio sources is observed to occur almost always only in elliptical galaxies or obvious recent mergers @xcite .",
    "additionally , feedback from supernova winds is also unlikely to affect these galaxies , as the star formation rates in lsbs are known to be lower than the rates in high surface brightness galaxies of similar morphological type @xcite .",
    "we note here that recent high resolution hydrodynamical simulations have produced galaxies with cored cdm halos by including baryonic processes that effectively remove mass @xcite , though @xcite reach a different conclusion .",
    "finally , even if there were a plausible model to explain figure 2 , we show below that the required value of @xmath4 is in strong disagreement with lyman alpha forest data .    in figure 3",
    ", we plot the range of @xmath4 for the galaxies and again find that , for a given dark matter model , the data are _ not _ consistent with a single @xmath4 value . for our sample of galaxies , @xmath4 ranges between @xmath41 and @xmath42 in units of @xmath43 .",
    "this result does not change when the baryons are accounted for by assuming a non - zero stellar mass - to - light ratio , as shown for f583 - 1 in figure 3 .",
    "these limits on @xmath4 are about 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the lower limit on thermal wdm implied by the lyman alpha forest power spectrum of @xmath44 @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "thus , even if there were a wdm model whose primordial phase space density value was in tandem with some other process that sets the core sizes in these galaxies , we would have a model that is inconsistent with the lyman alpha forest data by orders of magnitude .",
    "we now consider the sidm model predictions .",
    "this is easier to analyze because the sidm models predict a correlation between core size and core density . in most models of dark matter with large self - interactions , all dark matter halos",
    "are predicted to either have the same core density or to show a trend in @xmath8 as a function of velocity dispersion of the halo @xcite .",
    "one reason for this trend is the dependence of the scattering or annihilation cross section on relative velocity .",
    "additionally , adiabatic expansion due to particle loss will result in a systematically smaller core density in less massive halos @xcite .",
    "we note that a monotonic relation between the cross section and the velocity translates to a monotonic relation between the core density and the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles in the core .",
    "we expect the velocity dispersion in the core to be isotropic and proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "it therefore follows that the expectation from sidm models is that the inferred core density should be either roughly constant or exhibit a monotonic trend with @xmath45 .",
    "we note that if the self - interaction process has been operating for differing times in these galaxies , for example as the result of a recent major merger , then some dispersion may be introduced into the inferred @xmath8 versus @xmath45 relation",
    ". however , this seem unlikely given the uniformity of the sample and the lack of observational evidence for any recent disturbance .    in figure 4 , we plot @xmath8 against @xmath45 for each galaxy and show a representative example of how @xmath8 changes if a non - zero stellar mass - to - light ratio is assumed .",
    "we find that @xmath8 is not constant across the sample , nor is there evidence for a systematic trend in @xmath8 as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "this indicates that the inferred cores in these lsb galaxies can not be directly set by large self - interactions ( scattering or annihilation ) of dark matter .",
    "warm dark matter models and strongly self - interacting dark matter models have been proposed to alleviate some of the difficulties that cdm faces on small scales .",
    "we have tested models of thermal wdm and non - thermal wdm from early decays with high - resolution rotation curves for lsb galaxies .",
    "we infer the observed halo core radii to span about an order of magnitude around a kpc , while wdm models would predict a spread of only about a factor of 2 .",
    "additionally , the values of @xmath4 inferred from these lsb galaxies are orders of magnitude smaller than the lower limits implied by the lyman alpha forest power spectra . taken together , we interpret these results to mean that the cores in these lsb disk galaxies can not be a direct result of wdm particle properties .",
    "we also find the data to be inconsistent with a single value of core density @xmath8 and find no evidence for a trend in @xmath8 with the maximum circular velocity .",
