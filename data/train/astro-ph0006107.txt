    "since the discovery of the gravitational radiation driven instability of the @xmath0-modes by andersson ( 1998 ) and friedman & morsink ( 1998 ) , a large number of studies on the properties of @xmath0-modes and inertial modes of rotating stars have been done to prove their possible importance in astrophysics ( for a recent review see , e.g. , friedman & lockitch 1999 ) .",
    "although early investigations of the @xmath0-mode instability were mainly applied to young hot neutron stars ( e.g. , lindblom , owen , & morsink 1998 ; owen et al .",
    "1998 ) , recently some authors have also discussed possible roles of the @xmath0-mode instability in old and cool neutron stars with a solid crust and a magnetic field , as those found in low mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ( e.g. , andersson , kokkotas , & stergioulas 1999 ; bildsten & ushomirsky 2000 ; rezzolla , lamb , & shapiro 2000 ) .",
    "for example , bildsten & ushomirsky ( 2000 ) have suggested that the @xmath0-mode instability can be largely weakened by the effects of viscous damping in the boundary layer at the interface between the solid crust and the fluid core .",
    "rezzolla et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have also suggested that amplitude of @xmath0-mode oscillations tends to reduce due to the coupling to the magnetic field of a star .",
    "it is well known that neutron stars with a solid crust show a rich spectrum of nonradial oscillation modes , for example , nonradial modes associated with the solid crust and those associated with the fluid core and the surface fluid ocean ( mcdermott et al .",
    "if the effects of rotation are taken into account , it is quite common to find avoided crossings , as functions of @xmath1 , between various oscillation modes of the neutron star model with a solid crust ( lee & strohmayer 1996 ) .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath0-modes .",
    "when the angular rotation frequency @xmath1 of the star is small , the @xmath0-mode frequency observed in the corotating frame may be given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the indices of the spherical harmonic function representing the dominant toroidal component of the displacement vector .",
    "on the other hand , the crustal toroidal mode frequency may be given by ( e.g. , strohmayer 1991 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the oscillation frequency of the mode at @xmath8 .",
    "the frequencies of the two modes get close to each other at @xmath9 as shown by mcdermott et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and lee & strohmayer ( 1996 ) , the oscillation frequency of the crustal toroidal mode that has no radial nodes of the eigenfunction is of order of @xmath10 for @xmath11 , and hence we have @xmath12 for the modes with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mass and radius of the neutron star , and @xmath16 is the gravitational constant .",
    "this suggests that the mode crossing can happen between the two modes at sufficiently small rotation rates .",
    "almost all previous discussions on the @xmath0-mode instability , however , did not take account of the effects of mode crossing between the two different kinds of modes",
    ".- modes in a constant density neutron star with a constant shear modulus crust . ] in fact , the discussions have been based on the assumptions that the modal property of the @xmath0-modes is almost independent of the rotation frequency @xmath1 and hence that an extrapolation formula , obtained in the limit of @xmath2 , is applicable to rapidly rotating neutron stars with @xmath17 .",
    "obviously these two assumptions are not necessarily correct for the @xmath0-modes that experience mode coupling with other kinds of oscillation modes .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the @xmath0-mode instability of neutron stars that have a solid crust , by considering the effects of the mode crossing between the @xmath0-modes and the crustal toroidal modes .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we show the modal properties of the @xmath0-modes of neutron stars with a solid crust . in  3 , we discuss the dissipation timescales of the @xmath0-modes .",
    " 4 is for discussions and conclusions .",
    "neutron star models we use in this paper are the same as those used in the modal analysis by mcdermott et al .",
    "the models are taken from the evolutionary sequences for cooling neutron stars calculated by richardson et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , where the envelope structure is constructed by following gudmundsson , pethick & epstein ( 1983 ) .",
    "these models are composed of a fluid core , a solid crust and a surface fluid ocean , and the interior temperature is finite and is not constant as a function of the radial distance @xmath0",
    ". the models are not isentropic and the schwarzschild discriminant @xmath18 has finite values in the interior ( see , e.g. , yoshida & lee 2000b ) .",
    "the method of calculation of nonradial oscillations of rotating neutron stars with a solid crust is the same as that used by lee & strohmayer ( 1996 ) , in which the cowling approximation is employed .",
    "the terms due to the coriolis force are included in the perturbation equations but no effects of the centrifugal force are considered .",
    "this approximation may be justified for low frequency modes satisfying @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the oscillation frequency observed in the corotating frame of the star ( unno et al .",
    "the eigenfunctions are expanded in terms of spherical harmonic functions @xmath22 with different values of @xmath23 for a given @xmath5 .",
    "here spherical polar coordinates @xmath24 are used .",
    "for example , the lagrangian displacement vector , @xmath25 is expanded as @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 for even modes and @xmath31 and @xmath32 for odd modes where @xmath33 ( lee & strohmayer 1996 , see also lee & saio 1986 ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath34 denotes the oscillation frequency observed in an inertial frame , and we have @xmath35 . in this paper , to obtain a good convergence of the eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies at a given @xmath1 , we keep an enough number of terms in the series expansion of the eigenfunctions .",
    "we computed frequency spectra of @xmath0-modes , inertial modes , and crustal toroidal modes for the three - component neutron star models called ns05t7 , ns05t8 , and ns13t8 ( see , mcdermott et al .",
    "the obtained mode spectra for the three models are qualitatively the same . in this paper",
    ", we therefore show the mode spectrum for the model ns13t8 , because this is the most compact model among the three .",
    "the mass @xmath14 and the radius @xmath15 of the model ns13t8 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , and the central temperature is @xmath38 .    in figure 1 ,",
    "scaled eigenfrequencies @xmath39 of @xmath0-modes , inertial modes , and a crustal toroidal mode of the model ns13t8 are given as functions of @xmath40 for @xmath41 , where @xmath21 is the frequency observed in the corotating frame of the star . here only the fundamental @xmath0-modes with @xmath42 are considered since they are most important for the @xmath0-mode instability of neutron stars ( see lockitch & friedman 1999 ; yoshida & lee 2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "the crustal toroidal mode shown in figure 1 is the fundamental mode with no radial nodes of the eigenfunction and has the smallest oscillation frequency of the mode of this kind for a given @xmath4 at @xmath8 ( see mcdermott et al .",
    "note that at @xmath43 it is practically impossible to correctly calculate rotational modes because of their coupling with high overtone @xmath44-modes . in this figure ,",
    "we have used the notation given by @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the @xmath0-modes , @xmath47 for the crustal toroidal modes , and @xmath48 for the inertial modes , where @xmath4 denotes the index of the spherical harmonic function associated with the dominant toroidal component of the displacement vector , @xmath49 is the number of radial nodes of the eigenfunction , and @xmath50 is the number introduced to classify the inertial modes ( see , e.g. , yoshida & lee 2000a ) . note that the mode classification has been done at sufficiently small values of @xmath51 .",
    "since there appear surface @xmath0-modes and core @xmath0-modes for the three - component neutron star models , we have also introduced the superscripts @xmath52 and @xmath53 to distinguish the two kinds of @xmath0-modes .",
    "the oscillation energy of the core @xmath0-mode is predominantly confined in the fluid core , and that of the surface @xmath0-mode is confined in the surface ocean .",
    "a typical eigenfunction of a surface @xmath0-mode is given in lee & strohmayer ( 1996 ) .",
    "the modes in the figure are all odd modes ( with @xmath54 for the toroidal modes ) and they are retrograde modes propagating in the opposite direction to that of stellar rotation .",
    "figure 1 clearly shows that the mode crossing between the @xmath55-mode and the @xmath56-mode , as predicted by equations ( [ om - r ] ) to ( [ om - cross ] ) , leads to an avoided crossing of their frequencies as functions of @xmath51 . at the avoided crossing ,",
    "the modal properties of the two modes are exchanged .",
    "this is understood by examining the eigenfunctions of the two modes before and after the crossing , which are indicated by the filled circles in figure 1 , where the labels ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) attaching to the filled circles are corresponding to the panels ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) in figure 2 . note that the @xmath56-mode at @xmath57 , which should carry the label ( b ) , is not shown in figure 1 , because @xmath58 . in figure 2 , the expansion coefficients @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 of the two modes with @xmath42 at @xmath57 in panels ( a ) and ( b ) and at @xmath62 in panels ( c ) and ( d )",
    "are given as functions of the fractional radius @xmath63 , where the eigenfunctions are normalized as @xmath64 with @xmath65 being the bottom of the solid crust of the model .",
    "when @xmath51 is sufficiently small , the @xmath55-mode in panel ( a ) and the @xmath56-mode in panel ( b ) have their typical eigenfunctions and the influence of other modes on the eigenfunction is negligible . through the avoided crossing ,",
    "however , the modal properties of the two modes are exchanged along the frequency curves as @xmath51 increases . as shown by figure 2",
    ", the mode in panel ( d ) , which is corresponding to the mode ( d ) on the frequency curve of @xmath56 in figure 1 , has in the fluid core the eigenfunction characteristic of the @xmath55-mode . on the other hand ,",
    "the mode in panel ( c ) , which corresponds to the mode ( c ) on the frequency curve of @xmath55 , has in the crust the eigenfunction characteristic of the @xmath56-mode .",
    "however , this avoided crossing between the two modes is not sharp in the sense that the eigenfunction of each of the two modes suffers the contamination of the other mode after the avoided crossing .",
    "for example , the mode ( d ) , which may be regarded as a core @xmath0-mode , has also oscillation amplitudes in the solid crust .",
    "this is in a sharp contrast with avoided crossings , for example , between @xmath66 and @xmath55 and between @xmath67 and @xmath55 , for which the mode properties are almost completely exchanged through the crossings .",
    "because of the avoided crossing between the @xmath55-mode and the crustal toroidal modes , the @xmath55-mode will lose its simple modal property of the eigenfrequency and the eigenfunction as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "we note that the fundamental @xmath0-mode with @xmath13 of fluid stars has such a simple modal property as a function of @xmath51 ( e.g. , yoshida & lee 2000b ; karino et al .",
    "2000 ) .    avoided crossing between the @xmath68 and @xmath69 modes with @xmath13 may be common for neutron stars with a solid crust . to show this , we calculate the @xmath68 modes with @xmath42 for @xmath70 polytropic neutron star models in which a solid crust is artificially embedded and isentropic structure is assumed .",
    "we assume the same physical parameters , such as the mass , radius , and the crust thickness , as those of the model ns13t8 .",
    "for the shear modulus @xmath71 , we assume that the ratio @xmath72 is constant in the crust where @xmath73 is the mass density ( see e.g. , mcdermott et al .",
    "1988 ) . in table 1 , we tabulated the values of @xmath72 in the crust and the frequencies @xmath7 of the fundamental @xmath56 mode at @xmath74 .",
    "we note that @xmath7 of the polytropic model is approximately proportional to the value of @xmath75 .",
    "figure 3 gives the scaled frequencies @xmath76 of the @xmath55-mode as functions of @xmath51 for the polytropic models .",
    "the bends of the frequency curves of the @xmath0-modes as @xmath1 increases are caused by the avoided crossing with the crustal toroidal modes @xmath56 , as found in fig.1 for a realistic neutron star model .",
    "as figure 3 indicates the avoided crossing between the @xmath55-mode and the @xmath56-mode is a common phenomenon and occurs at around @xmath77 , which is determined by @xmath7 for given @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see equation ( [ om - cross ] ) ) .",
    "the apparent difference in behavior of the @xmath0-mode frequencies as a function of @xmath1 between the three polytropic models is therefore attributable to the difference in the location @xmath78 of the avoided crossing , that is , to the difference in the property @xmath72 of the solid crust .",
    "here , it is worth while to note that , as shown by yoshida & lee ( 2000b ) , the deviation of the model from isentropic structure is not important for the fundamental @xmath0-modes with @xmath13 and inertial modes , if the schwarzschild discriminant @xmath18 of the nonisentropic model has sufficiently small absolute values as is expected in neutron stars . as a matter of fact ,",
    "we can obtain similar results to those shown in figure 1 , even if we artificially set @xmath79 in the model ns13t8 .",
    "for comparison with other studies on the @xmath0-mode instability , let us derive an extrapolation formula for the damping timescale of the fundamental core @xmath0-mode with @xmath42 by calculating the @xmath0-modes at sufficiently small values of @xmath51 , for which the mode coupling with the crustal toroidal mode is negligibly weak . then , using the same shear and bulk viscosity coefficients as those employed in yoshida & lee ( 2000a ) and taking account of the viscous boundary layer ( vbl ) damping effects following the formulation given in bildsten & ushomirsky ( 2000 ) ( see also andersson et al ( 2000 ) for a correction ) , we may approximately express the formula as ( see e.g. , lindblom et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the average density of the star , and @xmath82 is the central temperature .",
    "the same viscosity coefficients are used both in the fluid and solid regions , and no effects of superfluidity in the core and in the inner crust are considered . here ,",
    "the first , second , third and fourth terms in the right - hand side of equation ( [ tau ] ) are contributions from the shear viscosity , the bulk viscosity , the shear viscosity in vbl and the current quadrupole radiation , respectively .",
    "the factors containing the ratio @xmath83 have been introduced in equation ( [ tau ] ) to extrapolate the damping rates with respect to the central temperature @xmath82 .    in table 2 ,",
    "the various dissipation timescales @xmath84 of the @xmath55 modes with @xmath42 are tabulated for the model ns13t8 and a simple @xmath70 polytropic model with a static solid crust . for the polytropic model ,",
    "we employ @xmath85 and @xmath86 and assume that a solid crust forms in the density region of @xmath87 . note that no wave propagation is assumed in the static crust of the polytropic model employed in this section .",
    "bildsten & ushomirsky ( 2000 ) ( see also anderson et al .",
    "2000 , and rieutord 2000 for more detailed treatment of vbl ) used the similar polytropic model with a static solid crust to estimate the vbl damping effects on the @xmath0-modes . to compute the @xmath0-modes of the simple polytropic model ,",
    "the method given in yoshida & lee ( 2000a ) , in which effects of the centrifugal force and perturbations of the gravitational potential are taken into account , has been employed . as shown by table 2 , all the dissipative timescales , except that due to the bulk viscosity , have similar values both for the simple polytropic model and for the model ns13t8 .",
    "we note that although the destabilization due to the current quadrupole radiation for the model ns13t8 is by one order of magnitude stronger than that for the polytropic model , the vbl damping timescales , which are most important among the damping mechanisms of the @xmath0-modes , are almost the same for the two models .",
    "we consider that the difference in @xmath88 between the two models is caused by the difference in the compactness @xmath89 of the models , where @xmath53 denotes velocity of light .",
    "the huge difference in the damping timescales associated with the bulk viscosity between the two models may come from the difference in the treatment of the modes in the crust . although we count the damping contributions in the crust for the model ns13t8 , we do not count them for the polytropic model because we have assumed that the crust is static and allows no oscillations .",
    "in addition to this , the model ns13t8 in an evolutionary sequence of cooling neutron stars has the crustal temperature that is higher by a factor 7 than the core temperature . since the bulk viscosity coefficient is proportional to @xmath90 , the contribution of the bulk viscosity in the crust",
    "is largely enhanced for the damping of the @xmath0-modes .",
    "it is well known that retrograde oscillations whose frequency @xmath21 satisfies the condition @xmath91 are unstable to the gravitational radiation reaction ( friedman & schutz 1978 ) . using equation ( [ om - t ] )",
    ", we can show that the retrograde crustal toroidal modes satisfy this condition and become unstable to the gravitational radiation reaction when @xmath92 where @xmath7 denotes the oscillation frequency of the mode at @xmath8 .",
    "this instability can happen at slow rotation rates of the star if @xmath7 is sufficiently small .",
    "note that all crustal toroidal modes shown in figure 1 are unstable to the gravitational radiation reaction .",
    "our preliminary stability calculation , however , shows that the instability of the crustal toroidal mode is very weak and may not be important .    in this paper",
    ", we have investigated the properties of @xmath0-modes of slowly rotating neutron stars with a solid crust .",
    "we have found that the mode property of the core @xmath93 mode with @xmath42 , which is most important for the @xmath0-mode instability of neutron stars , is strongly affected by mode coupling with the crustal @xmath56 modes as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this means that we can not assume a simple mode property of the core @xmath93 modes with @xmath13 as a function of @xmath51 . to discuss the @xmath0-mode instability of rotating neutron stars it has been common to derive an extrapolation formula for the damping timescale of the @xmath0-modes ( e.g. , lindblom et al .",
    "the extrapolation is usually carried out about the interior temperature @xmath94 and the rotation frequency @xmath1 . the extrapolation with respect to the temperature",
    "may be justified if the stars have an isothermal structure characterized , for example , by the central temperature @xmath82 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the mode properties of the @xmath0-mode are well known only in the limit of @xmath95 , the damping timescales are calculated in this limit and are extrapolated to rapidly rotating neutron stars with @xmath96 .",
    "this process of the extrapolation with respect to @xmath1 is justified if the mode frequency @xmath21 is well approximated by @xmath97 and the eigenfunction has the dominant toroidal component , independent of @xmath1 . we know that the above two assumptions are satisfied for the fundamental @xmath0-modes with @xmath13 for fluid stars ( yoshida & lee 2000b ; yoshida et al .",
    "2000 ; karino et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the case of neutron stars with a solid crust , however , the two assumptions are not satisfied except when @xmath98 and no mode couplings are expected .",
    "for example , when the @xmath0-mode is near the avoided crossing with the crustal @xmath56 mode , the eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of the @xmath0-mode behave peculiarly and change rapidly as functions of @xmath1 .",
    "this makes it difficult to predict reliably the evolution of a neutron star driven by the @xmath0-mode instability through the avoided crossing by simply extrapolating the damping timescales obtained at small @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to this , the eigenfunctions of the @xmath0-modes are contaminated by the crustal torsional modes at large @xmath1 , and the extrapolated damping timescales are not necessarily accurate enough to give the useful estimations .",
    "these difficulties mean that the extrapolation formula of the damping timescales of the @xmath0-modes , derived in the limit of @xmath95 , is not applicable to the discussion on the @xmath0-mode instability of the rapidly rotating neutron stars with a solid crust unless the effects of the avoided crossings with and the contamination of the eigenfunctions by the crustal torsional modes are correctly taken into account . in this sense ,",
    "discussions based on the extrapolation formula of the damping timescales are not fully justified for neutron stars with a solid crust .",
