    "<S> thin , solid bodies with metric symmetries admit a restricted form of reparameterization invariance . their dynamical equilibria include motions with both rigid and flowing aspects . on such configurations , </S>",
    "<S> a quantity is conserved along the intrinsic coordinate corresponding to the symmetry . as an example of its utility , this conserved quantity is combined with linear and angular momentum currents to construct solutions for the equilibria of a rotating , flowing string , for which it is akin to bernoulli s constant .    </S>",
    "<S> the mechanics of thin bodies are amenable to a description in which energies are effectively expressed with an integral over a surface or curve . on sufficiently long time scales , and when longitudinal waves are not important , the effective action is often taken to be metrically constrained , with a low - dimensional body stress tensor enforcing local distances between moving pieces of material . </S>",
    "<S> this approach , either at the level of the action or equations of motion , has been used to describe systems at many scales , from the overdamped motions of flagella @xcite , filaments @xcite , or macromolecules @xcite , to the inertial dynamics of elastic rods @xcite , soft robot links @xcite , yarn @xcite , flags @xcite , or sonar and telegraph cables in the ocean @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thin bodies such as rods and solid membranes moving in a higher - dimensional space share characteristics with both rigid bodies and fluids . the metric constraints of inextensible solids preclude the broad reparameterization invariance inherent to fluids and fluid membranes , leaving only highly restricted reparameterization invariance associated with any metric symmetries the body may possess . </S>",
    "<S> effectively one has global , rather than local , symmetries on the body . </S>",
    "<S> however , these intrinsic symmetries are not trivially identifiable with rigid transformations of embedding coordinates , because a lower - dimensional body can adopt extrinsic curvature in the surrounding space . </S>",
    "<S> thus , unlike space - filling rigid continua , the body may display additional material flows in equilibrium in addition to , and distinct from , rigid motions . </S>",
    "<S> simple examples include a string being unspooled @xcite , a cable being laid down on the ocean floor @xcite , or the flowing skirt of a rotating dancer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ rot ] is a schematic of such a combined rigid - flowing configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> rot.pdf ( 30,100)@xmath0 ( 60,120)@xmath1 ( 157,100)@xmath0 ( 187,120)@xmath1 ( 176,90)@xmath2 ( 195,50)@xmath3 ( 213,112)@xmath4    we will describe such a system using several types of coordinates . aside from a time coordinate , there are three important sets of spatial coordinates to consider . </S>",
    "<S> first , there are time - independent coordinates attached to pieces of material . for an inextensible body , </S>",
    "<S> these can also be associated with geometric parameters , such as arc length . </S>",
    "<S> second , there are coordinates for which material motions tangent to the body have been removed . </S>",
    "<S> these are effectively eulerian from the intrinsic viewpoint of the body , but they are attached to a body moving through an embedding space , so have some lagrangian character as well . </S>",
    "<S> this viewpoint is called the `` orthogonal gauge '' in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , there are the embedding coordinates , which we will assume to be the simple cartesian coordinates associated with an inertial frame in @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> . we will refer to these three sets of spatial coordinates as material or body ( lagrangian ) , body - eulerian , and embedding ( eulerian ) , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the action of a continuum may possess symmetries in any of these coordinates , and corresponding conserved quantities may be extracted by application of noether s theorems . </S>",
    "<S> translational and rotational symmetries with respect to embedding coordinates correspond to familiar conservation laws for linear and angular momentum . for solids , symmetries with respect to material coordinates imply symmetries of the body metric . for space - filling inextensible solids @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , these must necessarily coincide with rigid motions of the embedding coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> fluids have a greater range of allowable reparameterizations or `` relabelings '' , namely any transformations that conserve the density of labels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some workers have investigated symmetries of thin solid - like or fluid - like bodies in a higher - dimensional background , including relativistic extended objects @xcite , energy - bearing curves @xcite , or fluid membranes @xcite . in this note , we introduce a conserved quantity for thin body dynamical equilibria , corresponding to a symmetry with respect to either body or body - eulerian coordinates . in the former case , which corresponds to rigid motions , the quantity is identical to a flux derived in a non - variational manner for uniform rods by maddocks and dichmann @xcite . in either case , it is a useful tool in the search for solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these ideas with the concrete example of a rotating , flowing string , known as a `` yarn balloon '' in textile processing applications @xcite . in this example </S>",
    "<S> , the conserved quantity is constructed from portions of the kinetic energy and body stress . </S>",
    "<S> related problems involving axially moving structures such as belts have stimulated discussion of eulerian action principles and the boundary conditions they produce @xcite . other related work seeks to extend action principles and noether s theorems to general non - material volumes @xcite .    without loss of generality , we will discuss a one - dimensional body such as that of figure [ rot ] . </S>",
    "<S> let us begin by describing the body with a cartesian embedding vector @xmath6 , parameterized by a material coordinate @xmath7 and time @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> consider the action of a classical string , which is an integral over a constrained kinetic energy density @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is a uniform mass density , and the stress or tension @xmath11 is a multiplier enforcing the metric constraint @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the string is inextensible , and the material coordinate is also the arc length . </S>",
    "<S> the rather trivial metric of the body , @xmath13 , is symmetric in @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> the variation of body coordinates will be performed in an analogous manner to the time variation that leads to the temporal boundary term representing the total energy ( hamiltonian ) of a classical action . </S>",
    "<S> recall that for an action of the form @xmath14 a time shift @xmath15 results in a new action @xmath16 after integration by parts , the integral term may contribute to the temporal boundary term . </S>",
    "<S> in our case , @xmath17 we are only interested in the temporal boundary term , which has contributions from the shift in endpoints as well as an integration by parts of the kinetic term inside the integral .. ] this boundary term can be set equal to a constant , @xmath18 this is the total energy of the body , purely kinetic in this case because the constraints store no energy .    </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath19 is an integral over the entire body , it is not very useful in solving for the local dynamics of an extended object like a string . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we would like to find quantities that are uniform along the string , that is , conserved along a body coordinate rather than in time . </S>",
    "<S> now consider an analogous variation of the material coordinate @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath21 \\ , , \\\\      & = -\\int_{t_1}^{t_2 } \\!\\!dt \\left [ \\left . </S>",

    "<S> a uniform reparameterization @xmath22 is a symmetry of the action , and yields the constant @xmath23 this is identical to the constant @xmath24 in @xcite , and to the constant @xmath25 in @xcite if @xmath11 is replaced with the appropriate component of the surface stress there . </S>",
    "<S> it is a particular manifestation of a conservation law for uniform , hyperelastic rods @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we may also vary the position vector , as if to derive momentum balance equations . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 if @xmath28 corresponds to a continuous symmetry of the system , we may obtain new constants . for a system rigidly rotating about an axis @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , there are two such symmetries , namely translations @xmath29 along @xmath1 and infinitesimal rotations @xmath30 about @xmath1 . thus , @xmath31 these constants were called @xmath32 and @xmath33 in @xcite , and @xmath34 here is analogous to @xmath35 in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we may now easily obtain a quadrature for rigidly rotating string equilibria . </S>",
    "<S> note that we can form an orthonormal triad of @xmath1 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , and that with the origin of @xmath38 on the @xmath1 axis , @xmath39 and , thus , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for a string rigidly rotating with angular frequency @xmath0 about @xmath1 , @xmath42 , </S>",
    "<S> so @xmath11 may be written as a function of a single variable @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> now use the three constants , , and to write : @xmath44 this can also be reformulated in terms of an elliptic integral in @xmath45 @xcite , but we need not do that here . solving for @xmath46 , one then obtains @xmath11 directly from , and the other two coordinates by quadratures using and or . </S>",
    "<S> nondimensionalizing , using some chosen length scale along with @xmath10 and @xmath0 , will lead to a family of equations with our three constants @xmath47 , @xmath34 , and @xmath48 as parameters . ) </S>",
    "<S> was absorbed into the others , effectively eliminating a scaling degree of freedom . in the analysis of a flowing skirt @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the shapes were presumed to have an additional symmetry , allowing description in terms of a spherical curve rather than a space curve ; this yields equations with one less parameter . ] </S>",
    "<S> these three constants were found a century ago by gray @xcite , who used them to construct a quadrature akin to , but for the radial coordinate @xmath46 in terms of the coordinate @xmath49 along the axis of rotation , rather than in terms of the arc length @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider rigid motion of a _ shape _ , with flow of material along it . in the case of an inextensible string , this must be a uniform flow along the tangent vectors , as illustrated in figure [ rot ] for a rotating shape . </S>",
    "<S> this is a trivial example of a killing flow , a velocity field on a manifold that preserves its metric . </S>",
    "<S> such rigid - flowing equilibria occur during the controlled , rapid unspooling of yarn @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> gray discussed properties of such a configuration , but did not construct the solutions @xcite .    the symmetry of this system is not in the material coordinate @xmath7 , but in a body - eulerian coordinate @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a constant tangential velocity on the string . </S>",
    "<S> is like the @xmath52 of @xcite , and should not be confused with the @xmath51 that briefly appears in @xcite and there represents the total velocity in the direction of the tangents , including any contribution from rigid motion . ] </S>",
    "<S> we must consider a body - eulerian action integral describing a rigidly moving shape into , along , and out of which material is flowing . </S>",
    "<S> we write @xmath53 the velocity appearing in the kinetic energy term is made up of a piece @xmath54 describing the motion in our case , rigid rotation of a point on the shape , plus a tangential flow @xmath55 on the shape . if we were integrating over a material volume </S>",
    "<S> , the limits of integration of the @xmath56 integral would be time - dependent , and we would simply be rewriting the previous action . </S>",
    "<S> this is a different action , one that has a symmetry in @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is reminiscent of many engineering problems involving a finite window of an axially moving system @xcite , or a garden hose or other conduit @xcite .    under the variation @xmath57 , the spatial boundary term is @xmath58 the regrouping of terms between and anticipates subsequent expressions </S>",
    "<S> . it will be helpful to rewrite the current in terms of the original material description of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath59 the constants @xmath60 and @xmath48 coincide when @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> note the resemblance of and to bernoulli s equation , applied to ideal fluid flowing along a fixed or rotating streamline . </S>",
    "<S> in fluid or solid , coriolis terms arising from simultaneous flow and rotation do not contribute to the conserved quantities . because @xmath62 is a constant , expressions and are consistent with the ( unnumbered ) expression for the related constant @xmath63 derived in a different manner in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several results in fluid mechanics , including conservation of potential vorticity and the kelvin circulation theorem , are derivable either through relabeling symmetry or alternate approaches @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the other constants are also modified by the flow , and our new choice of action integral . in terms of the body - eulerian @xmath64 , @xmath65\\cdot{\\bm{\\mathrm{\\hat z } } } \\ , ,   \\\\      </S>",
    "<S> j_z & = \\left[-\\mu t\\left(\\partial_t{{\\bf x}}+ t\\partial_\\eta{{\\bf x}}\\right)+ \\sigma\\partial_\\eta{{\\bf x}}\\right]\\cdot\\left({\\bm{\\mathrm{\\hat z } } } \\times { { \\bf x}}\\right ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and in terms of the material @xmath6 , @xmath66 equation above corresponds with equation ( 21 ) in @xcite . both expressions and </S>",
    "<S> will simplify further after explicit insertion of the material velocity @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate system constructed earlier is still useful here . </S>",
    "<S> we now have a shape rigidly rotating with angular frequency @xmath0 about @xmath1 , with an additional uniform flow @xmath51 along it . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 this new expression for @xmath34 already tells us that for nonzero @xmath51 , generic solutions are three - dimensional , rather than coplanar with the axis of rotation . </S>",
    "<S> note also the expression @xmath70 , reflecting the routhian symmetry of inertial frames @xcite . without the non - inertial frame created by rotation @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the equilibrium shapes would be unaffected by the flow @xmath51 along the shape , the centripetal forces arising from this motion balanced merely by a shift in the tension @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> let us rescale using an arbitrary length scale @xmath71 and the natural parameters of the problem : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 . then , proceeding in a similar manner as before , we obtain @xmath78 again , the stress and other coordinates follow directly or by quadratures . </S>",
    "<S> equation represents the full four - parameter family of equilibria of the rotating , flowing string . </S>",
    "<S> this new result extends prior work by several authors @xcite . to straight lines perpendicular to the rotation axis </S>",
    "<S> there are many other two - dimensional and three - dimensional equilibria with vanishing @xmath51 @xcite . in writing @xcite , one of the authors misinterpreted mack s expression in a favorable light it does not , in fact , </S>",
    "<S> coincide with the general coplanar limit in @xcite , but only with a single special case . </S>",
    "<S> gray s solution @xcite was at that time unknown to the author and , apparently , to the others as well . ] </S>",
    "<S> the geometries and stress distributions of the resulting curves are an interesting topic in their own right , and will be the focus of a future paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the solutions can also be obtained by manipulating variations of multiple auxiliary fields @xcite , or through extensive calculations involving integrations of projections of equations of motion @xcite . however , here we have introduced a minimum of variables into the actions , and have not solved or even invoked an equation of motion . symmetries and kinematical information are enough to directly reduce the problem to quadratures , using only a few lines of calculation . presumably , this approach has general utility , and may be exploited for many other problems involving dynamical equilibria of thin bodies . </S>",
    "<S> valuable extensions might include consideration of dissipative dynamics governed by nonconservative action principles @xcite , or nonuniform potentials corresponding to the presence of a body force @xcite . </S>"
