    "in the recent years the concept of lower ricci - curvature bounds has been generalized from the riemannian setting to the setting of geodesic metric measure spaces , most prominently in the works of sturm @xcite and lott and villani @xcite .",
    "different authors have studied slightly different definitions of curvature bounds . what is common to all these definitions is that they strive to fulfill the same set of criteria : to naturally extend ricci - curvature bounds of riemannian manifolds , to be stable under the measured gromov - hausdorff convergence , and to provide enough structure for meaningful analysis on the metric space .",
    "the first two criteria are well met @xcite , whereas the third one has so far been met only partially . from a classical result by buser @xcite we know that a riemannian manifold with nonnegative ricci - curvature supports a poincar inequality . moreover , in the case of measured gromov - hausdorff limits of riemannian manifolds with ricci - curvature bounded below we know that a local poincar inequality always holds @xcite . in order to prove a local poincar inequality for a larger class of metric spaces with ricci - curvature lower - bounds the stability under measured gromov - hausdorff convergence had to be sacrificed in @xcite by assuming the spaces to be nonbranching .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to complete this part of the theory for some versions of curvature - dimension conditions by proving local poincar inequalities without the unnatural extra assumption of nonbranching .",
    "the local poincar inequality together with a doubling measure constitute the very foundation of analysis on metric spaces which was pioneered by heinonen and koskela @xcite and cheeger @xcite . for an introduction to analysis on metric spaces we refer to the book by heinonen @xcite .",
    "poincar inequalities have been proven in many classes of metric spaces , for example in locally linearly contractible ahlfors - regular metric spaces @xcite .",
    "a metric measure space @xmath3 admits a weak local @xmath4-poincar inequality with @xmath5 if there exist constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 such that for any continuous function @xmath8 defined on @xmath9 , any point @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 such that @xmath12 and any upper gradient @xmath13 of @xmath8 we have @xmath14 where the barred integral denotes the average integral and @xmath15 denotes the average of @xmath8 in the ball @xmath16 .",

    "inequality it follows immediately that a weak local @xmath21-poincar inequality implies a weak local @xmath22-poincar inequality for every @xmath23 . in this paper",
    "we consider weak local @xmath24-poincar inequalities which we simply call weak local poincar inequalities .",
    "the word _ weak _ in the weak local poincar inequality refers to the fact that we allow the ball on the right - hand side of to be larger than the one on the left .",
    "if the balls on both sides of the inequality can be taken to be the same , meaning that we can take @xmath25 , the inequality is called a strong local poincar inequality . in a doubling geodesic metric space",
    "the weak local poincar inequality implies the strong one , with possibly a different constant @xmath26 , see @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "we say that a measure @xmath27 is doubling ( with a constant @xmath28 ) if for all @xmath10 and @xmath29 we have @xmath30    lott and villani gave in @xcite a definition for nonnegative @xmath31-ricci curvature with @xmath32 and a definition for @xmath33-ricci curvature being bounded below by @xmath34 . in their definition they required weak displacement convexity for a collection @xmath35 of suitable convex functionals .",
    "( for the precise definitions , see section [ sec : definitions ] . )",
    "more specifically they required that between any two probability measures that have bounded wasserstein distance between them there is at least one geodesic in the wasserstein space of probability measures along which all the functionals in @xmath35 satisfy a convexity inequality .",
    "at the same time when lott and villani defined their curvature - dimension bounds another definition was given by sturm @xcite .",
    "he defined spaces where @xmath31-ricci curvature is bounded from below by a constant @xmath34 . in sturm s definition",
    "the displacement convexity is also required along only one geodesic but for only one critical functional .",
    "later lott and villani combined the two different definitions by considering what we call here @xmath0 spaces with @xmath34 referring to the lower bound on curvature and @xmath36 $ ] to the upper bound on dimension . in this definition weak displacement convexity",
    "is again required for the whole collection @xmath35 .",
    "the assumptions in the definition by sturm are a priori weaker . however , in nonbranching metric spaces the two notions agree , see for example @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that our point is to avoid making the nonbranching assumption .",
    "therefore the results we get for @xmath0 spaces do not necessarily hold under the definitions of sturm .",
    "let us present the poincar inequalities we are able to obtain .",
    "the first result is for the large class of @xmath37 spaces .",
    "[ thm : cd1 ] suppose that @xmath3 is a @xmath37 space with @xmath38 .",
    "then the weak local poincar inequality @xmath39 holds for any continuous function @xmath8 defined on @xmath9 , any upper gradient @xmath13 of @xmath8 and for each point @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 .",
    "we do not have average integrals in theorem [ thm : cd1 ] like we had in .",
    "if we were to write the average integrals here we would have to multiply the right - hand side of the inequality by a factor @xmath40 .",
    "this factor could well be unbounded as @xmath41 in an infinite dimensional space .",
    "although for @xmath37 spaces the assumption for @xmath27 to be doubling is not very natural we always have doubling for @xmath0 spaces when @xmath42 : by the bishop - gromov inequality any @xmath0 space @xmath3 is doubling with a constant @xmath43 , see for example @xcite .",
    "therefore for @xmath0 spaces we can write our local poincar inequalities in a more standard form .    [ thm : cd2 ] any @xmath0 space with @xmath38 supports the weak local poincar inequality @xmath44 in particular , any @xmath45 space supports the uniform weak local poincar inequality @xmath46    notice that the constant @xmath47 here is better than the constant @xmath48 obtained in @xcite for nonbranching @xmath45 spaces .",
    "so far we have considered @xmath0 spaces where the weak displacement convexity is required for a class of functionals .",
    "we are unable to prove the previous two theorems from the curvature - dimension conditions of sturm where the weak displacement convexity is required for only one functional .",
    "the nonnegativity of @xmath31-ricci curvature can also be generalized to metric measure spaces using gradient flows .",

    "condition to the previous two curvature - dimension conditions after noticing that it implies the strong displacement convexity of the entropy functional corresponding to the e.v.i .",
    ", see @xcite .",
    "this means that the functional is not only displacement convex along one geodesic between any two measures , as was required in the definitions by sturm , and lott and villani , but it is in fact displacement convex along any geodesic between any two measures .",
    "this strong displacement convexity is not by itself stable under the measured gromov - hausdorff convergence and therefore it is a poor notion of curvature - dimension bound . clearly",
    "the curvature - dimension condition of sturm is also weaker than strong displacement convexity and thus weaker than the e.v.i .",

    "in other words , @xmath212 using the median @xmath211 we split the ball @xmath165 into two borel sets @xmath175 and @xmath176 so that @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 these sets exist because the measure @xmath27 has no atoms and thus we can split the level set @xmath217 , if necessary , so as to make the sets @xmath175 and @xmath176 have the same measure . let @xmath218 be the geodesic given by lemma [ lma : cd ] and let @xmath170 be the density of @xmath171 with respect to @xmath27 . by lemma",
    "[ lma : cd ] we have for all @xmath98 $ ] at @xmath27-almost every @xmath219 @xmath220 now observe that from we get an equality @xmath221 for @xmath166-almost every @xmath222 .",
    "therefore @xmath223 the rest of the proof follows the same lines as the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.5 ) .",
    "let us repeat the key steps here for the convenience of the reader .",
    "notice that @xmath166-almost every @xmath222 is contained in the ball @xmath224 . thus @xmath225",
    "\\(i ) in the proof of theorem [ thm : cd1 ] above we obtained only a weak version of the local poincar inequality because in general it might be that a geodesic between two points @xmath226 does not stay inside the ball @xmath16 .",
    "in a metric space @xmath72 where balls are convex in the sense that all the geodesics between any two points in a ball stay inside the ball the above proof immediately gives a strong local poincar inequality .",
    "for example in those @xmath56 spaces where the balls are convex we have @xmath227    \\(ii ) in a doubling geodesic metric space a weak local poincar inequality implies a strong local poincar inequality .",
    "when we move from the weak inequality to the strong inequality the constant usually has to be enlarged .",
    "however , from the assumption that the entropy @xmath53 is strongly displacement convex we can directly prove a strong local poincar inequality with the same constant as in corollary [ cor : evi2 ] : @xmath228 with two simple observations we can modify the proof of theorem [ thm : cd1 ] to give this inequality .",
    "the first observation is that we do not have to use geodesics in the proof but instead we can take a collection of curves whose lengths are uniformly bounded from above . as we will shortly see , suitable curves can be constructed by combining geodesics .",
    "the second observation is that a geodesic from a point @xmath229 to the center @xmath163 always stays inside the ball @xmath16 .    with a similar proof as for lemma [ lma : evi",
    "] we can show that for a geodesic @xmath230 from @xmath231 to @xmath167 we have for all @xmath232 $ ] at @xmath27-almost @xmath219 the estimate @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the density of @xmath171 with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "the same argument works for a geodesic @xmath235 from @xmath236 to @xmath167 .    by lemma [ lma : evi ] we know that for any @xmath237 we have for every @xmath98 $ ] at @xmath27-almost every @xmath238 the same bound for the density of @xmath239 with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "if we combine these three geodesics to a rectifiable curve @xmath240 \\to \\mathcal{p}(x)$ ] by defining @xmath241 we get a curve in @xmath70 joining @xmath231 to @xmath236 so that the support of @xmath242 is always inside @xmath165 and we have for all @xmath243 $ ] the upper bound @xmath244 for the density of @xmath242 at @xmath27-almost all @xmath238 .",
    "also , when we consider the curve @xmath136 as a measure on the rectifiable curves of @xmath9 , this measure is concentrated on curves in @xmath9 that have length bounded above by @xmath245 .",
    "therefore , the same estimates as in the proof of theorem [ thm : cd1 ] give us the strong local poincar inequality .",
    "let us now turn to the proof of theorem [ thm : uniqueness ] .",
    "we explain the idea behind the proof with the help of figure [ fig : idea ] . by assumption",
    "the entropy functional @xmath53 is convex along the geodesic in the space of measures which connects measure @xmath156 to @xmath246 using only geodesics in the upper part of the space .",
    "the graph of @xmath53 along this geodesic is drawn on the right with a dashed line . now consider a new geodesic between @xmath156 and @xmath154 that moves half of the measure using the upper part and half of the measure using the lower part of the space . with this geodesic",
    "the support of the transported measure is split to the upper and lower parts of the space . at the time when the measure is fully split",
    "the entropy is @xmath247 times the entropy of the corresponding measure along the geodesic which uses only the upper part of the space . on the graph in the figure [ fig : idea ]",
    "the entropy along this new geodesic is drawn with a solid line . on the time intervals",
    "@xmath248 $ ] and @xmath249 $ ] , when the support of the measure travels past the branching points of the space , the entropy has a dramatic change .",
    "this change contradicts the convexity of the entropy functional along the new geodesic proving that such branching space does not satisfy the strong convexity assumption .      guided by the idea presented above we try to reduce the general case to a situation corresponding to that in figure [ fig : idea ] .",
    "the first step is to show that if there are multiple geodesics joining many points in the space then there are also geodesics which agree on some initial time interval and then branch out .",
    "next we choose a subset from these geodesics for which the branching happens roughly at the same time and so that all of these geodesics branch out sufficiently . the first requirement guarantees that the large change in the entropy happens on a small enough time interval , as in figure [ fig : idea ] .",
    "the second requirement tells us that the supports of the two branches of the measure are really disjoint , justifying the calculations for the drop in the entropy .",
    "let us now make these steps rigorous .",
    "we already know that the measure @xmath27 is doubling so in particular it is outer regular .",
    "let us use this to show that there are lots of points @xmath251 where the two distinct geodesics from @xmath164 to @xmath163 agree on a small initial time interval .",
    "let @xmath252 and @xmath253 be so that @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "( actually , we know from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) that either @xmath27 is a point mass or @xmath255 for all @xmath252 and @xmath253 . )",
    "take a small @xmath256 and @xmath257 from the convexity of @xmath53 we get @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the absolutely continuous part of the measure @xmath260 with respect to @xmath27 . on the other hand , we always have by jensen s inequality @xmath261 combining the previous two estimates we see that @xmath262 as @xmath263",
    ". we also have @xmath264 with @xmath265 as @xmath263 . recalling that @xmath255 we get @xmath266 as @xmath263 , implying that @xmath267 for sufficiently small @xmath268 .",
    "therefore also the set @xmath269 has positive @xmath27-measure .",
    "the open interval @xmath270 can be covered by a countable number of intervals of the form @xmath271 $ ] with the restriction @xmath272 therefore there exist some such @xmath273 and @xmath274 for which the set @xmath275\\text { but not on } [ 0,t_2]\\ }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has positive @xmath27-measure .",
    "now let @xmath276 so that the set @xmath277\\text { and } d(\\gamma(t),\\gamma'(t ) ) > 2\\delta \\text { for some } t \\in [ t_1,t_2]\\ }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has positive @xmath27-measure .        because @xmath283 , there is some @xmath284 so that the set @xmath285 has positive @xmath27-measure .",
    "let us then select for all @xmath286 a pair of geodesics @xmath287 , @xmath288 so that @xmath289 , @xmath290 , @xmath291 for all @xmath292 $ ] , @xmath293 and @xmath294 . using these pairs we write @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",
    "next we define two measures @xmath297 .",
    "the first one is defined as @xmath298 and the second one as @xmath299    the definition of @xmath300 and @xmath301 guarantee that @xmath302 . here",
    "@xmath303 and @xmath304 are the absolutely continuous parts of @xmath305 and @xmath306 with respect to the measure @xmath27 . using the convexity of @xmath53 first to the geodesic @xmath307 between times @xmath308 and @xmath282 and then separately to the geodesics @xmath309 and @xmath310 between times @xmath281 and @xmath311 , and finally using the inequality we arrive at the contradiction @xmath312 thus proving the claim .",
