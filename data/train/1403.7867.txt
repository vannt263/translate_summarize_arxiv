    "the hypothesis testing theory is a well developed branch of mathematical statistics  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic approach allows to find satisfactory solutions in many different situations .",
    "the simplest problems , like the testing of two simple hypotheses , have well known solutions . recall that if we fix the first type error and seek the test which maximizes the power , then we obtain immediately ( by neyman - pearson lemma ) the most powerful test based on the likelihood ratio statistic .",
    "the case of composite alternative is more difficult to treat and here the asymptotic solution is available in the regular case .",
    "it is possible , using , for example , the score function test ( sft ) , to construct the asymptotically ( locally ) most powerful test .",
    "moreover , the general likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) and the wald test ( wt ) based on the maximum likelihood estimator are asymptotically most powerful in the same sense . in the non regular cases the situation became much more complex .",
    "first of all , there are different non regular ( singular ) situations . moreover , in all these situations",
    ", the choice of the asymptotically best test is always an open question .",
    "this work is an attempt to study all these situations on the model of inhomogeneous poisson processes .",
    "this model is sufficiently simple to allow us to realize the construction of the well known tests ( sft , glrt , wt ) and to verify that these test are asymptotically most powerful also for this model , in the case when it is regular . in the next paper",
    "we study the behavior of these tests in the case when the model is singular .",
    "the `` evolution of the singularity '' of the intensity function is the following : regular case ( finite fisher information , this paper ) , continuous but not differentiable ( cusp - type singularity , @xcite ) , discontinuous ( jump - type singularity , @xcite ) . in all the three cases",
    "we describe the tests analytically .",
    "more precisely , we describe the test statistics , the choice of the thresholds and the behavior of the power functions for local alternatives .",
    "note that the notion of _ local alternatives _ is different following the type of regularity / singularity .",
    "suppose we want to test the simple hypothesis @xmath0 against the one - sided alternative @xmath1 . in the regular case ,",
    "the local alternatives are usually given by , @xmath2 .",
    "in the case of a cusp - type singularity , the local alternatives are introduced by @xmath3 , @xmath2 . as to the case of a jump - type singularity ,",
    "the local alternatives are @xmath4 , @xmath2 . in all these problems ,",
    "the most interesting for us question is the comparison of the power functions of different tests . in singular cases ,",
    "the comparison is done with the help of numerical simulations .",
    "the main results concern the limit likelihood ratios in the non - regular situations .",
    "let us note , that in many other models of observations ( i.i.d .",
    ", time series , diffusion processes etc . )",
    "the likelihood ratios have the same limits as here ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the results presented here are of more universal nature and are valid for any other ( non necessarily poissonian ) model having one of considered here limit likelihood ratios .",
    "we recall that @xmath5 is an inhomogeneous poisson process with intensity function @xmath6 , @xmath7 , if @xmath8 and the increments of @xmath9 on disjoint intervals are independent and distributed according to the poisson law @xmath10 in all statistical problems considered in this work , the intensity functions are periodic with some known period @xmath11 and depend on some one - dimensional parameter , that is , @xmath12 .",
    "the basic hypothesis and the alternative are always the same : @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "the diversity of statements corresponds to different types of regularity / singularity of the function @xmath14 .",
    "the case of unknown period @xmath11 needs a special study .",
    "the hypothesis testing problems ( or closely related properties of the likelihood ratio ) for inhomogeneous poisson processes were studied by many authors ( see , for example , brown @xcite , kutoyants @xcite , lger and wolfson @xcite , liese and lorz @xcite , sung",

    "for simplicity of exposition we consider the model of @xmath15 independent observations of an inhomogeneous poisson process : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , are poisson processes with intensity function @xmath14 , @xmath19 . here",

    "we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mathematical expectation in the case when the true value is @xmath24 .",

    "the measures corresponding to poisson processes with different values of @xmath35 are equivalent .",

    "the comparison of tests can be done by comparison of their power functions .",
    "it is known that for any reasonable test and for any fixed alternative the power function tends to  @xmath46 . to avoid this difficulty , as usual",

    "we call a test @xmath56 locally asymptotically uniformly most powerful ( laump ) in the class @xmath57 if its power function @xmath58 satisfies the relation : for any test @xmath59 and any @xmath60 we have @xmath61\\geq 0.\\ ] ]    below we show that in the regular case many tests are laump . in the next paper @xcite , where we consider some singular situations , a `` reasonable '' definition of asymptotic optimality of tests is still an open question .",

    "the key propriety of statistical problems in the regular case is the _ local asymptotic normality _ ( lan ) of the family of measures of corresponding inhomogeneous poisson processes at the point @xmath74 .",
    "this means that the normalized likelihood ratio @xmath75 admits the representation @xmath76 where ( using the central limit theorem ) we have @xmath77\\\\ & \\longrightarrow \\widetilde{\\delta } \\sim \\mathcal { n}\\left(0,{\\rm    i}\\left(\\vartheta _ 1\\right ) \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( convergence in distribution under @xmath68 ) , and @xmath78 ( convergence in probability under @xmath68 ) .",
    "moreover , the last convergence is uniform on @xmath79 for any @xmath60 .",
