    "in the past two decades , the camassa - holm ( ch ) equation @xcite @xmath0 with @xmath1 being an arbitrary constant , derived by camassa and holm @xcite as a shallow water wave model , has attracted much attention in the theory of soliton and integrable system .",
    "the ch equation was first included in the work of fuchssteiner and fokas on hereditary symmetries as a very special case @xcite . since the work of camassa and holm @xcite , more diverse studies on this equation have remarkably been developed @xcite-@xcite . the most interesting feature of the ch equation ( [ ch ] ) is admitting peaked soliton ( peakon ) solutions in the case of @xmath2 .",
    "a peakon is a kind of weak solution in some sobolev space with corner at its crest .",
    "the stability and interaction of peakons were discussed in several references @xcite-@xcite .    as extension of the ch peakon equation ,",
    "other integrable peakon models have also been found , such as the degasperis - procesi ( dp ) equation @xcite @xmath3 the cubic nonlinear peakon equation @xcite @xmath4_x , \\quad   m = u - u_{xx},\\label{mch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the novikov s cubic nonlinear equation @xcite @xmath5 then , a naturally interesting theme is to study integrable multi - component peakon equations .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors proposed the two - component generalizations of the ch equation . in @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the two - component extensions of the cubic nonlinear equations ( [ mch ] ) and ( [ cchn ] ) were investigated , and while in @xcite , the three - component extensions of ch equation are derived .    in this paper , we propose the following three - component system @xmath6_x \\\\&+\\frac{1}{2}m_{12}(u_{11,x}u_{21}-u_{11}u_{21,x})-\\frac{1}{2}m_{21}(u_{11}u_{12,x}-u_{11,x}u_{12 } ) , \\\\ m_{12,t}=&\\frac{1}{2}[m_{12}(u_{11}^2-u_{11,x}^2+u_{12}u_{21}-u_{12,x}u_{21,x})]_x \\\\&+m_{11}(u_{11}u_{12,x}-u_{11,x}u_{12})+\\frac{1}{2}m_{12}(u_{12,x}u_{21}-u_{12}u_{21,x } ) , \\\\ m_{21,t}=&\\frac{1}{2}[m_{21}(u_{11}^2-u_{11,x}^2+u_{12}u_{21}-u_{12,x}u_{21,x})]_x \\\\&+m_{11}(u_{11}u_{21,x}-u_{11,x}u_{21})+\\frac{1}{2}m_{21}(u_{12}u_{21,x}-u_{12,x}u_{21 } ) , \\\\",

    "therefore , it is a three - component formation based on the ch equation ( [ ch ] ) and the cubic nonlinear ch equation ( [ mch ] ) , and we may call equation ( [ ceq ] ) the 3ch model .",
    "we show that the 3ch system is hamiltonian and possesses a lax pair and infinitely many conservation laws .",
    "furthermore , this three - component system admits the single peakon of traveling wave type as well as multi - peakon solutions .",
    "additionally , we pay attention to the reductions of the 3ch system so that a new integrable perturbed ch equation with cubic nonlinearity is generated to possess peakon solutions .",
    "the whole paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , a lax pair , hamiltonian structure , and conservation laws of equation ( [ ceq ] ) are presented . in section 3 , the single - peakon and multi - peakon solutions of equation ( [ ceq ] ) are given .",
