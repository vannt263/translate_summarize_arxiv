    "the core - level spectroscopy techniques , x - ray emission and absorption spectroscopy ( xes and xas ) , are two complementary methods , allowing to get the full information about the electronic structure of the system ( solids , molecules in gas or adsorbed phase , surfaces , interfaces , etc . ) in a whole range of occupied / unoccupied valence states , including the vicinity of the fermi level , i.e. the energy distributions of occupied and unoccupied electronic states , respectively  @xcite .",
    "recently these methods became especially interesting and attractive with the development of the next generation of x - ray sources , the x - ray free - electron lasers  @xcite , and the further development of the spectroscopic techniques allowing to study collective excitations in solids  @xcite .",
    "spectral photon intensity distribution in characteristic x - ray emission bands ( xeb ) contains information on the local characteristics of the valence band ( vb ) electron density of states ( dos ) distribution in crystals . despite a considerable success of one - electron methods in the description of the electronic structure of metals , for reliable interpretation of features of the experimental xeb",
    "it is necessary to use theoretical methods allowing , along with one - electron description of the xeb shapes , to consider many - electron effects which are consequences of the dynamical processes accompanying the x - ray transition . in particular , l@xmath0-xebs of simple na , mg and al metals contain features which are poorly described by the one - electron model and are attributed to the many - electron processes .",
    "for the first time , the theoretical consideration of the xeb features of metals near the fermi edge , caused by many - electron processes , was undertaken in refs .",
    "it was shown that in the characteristic l@xmath0-xeb and l@xmath0-absorption spectra of simple metals a narrow peak must be present in a small energy range near the fermi energy ( @xmath1 ) , while in k - xeb , this feature should be absent . in ref .",
    "@xcite this effect was associated with a dynamical screening of the core vacancy during the x - ray radiative transition .",
    "this vacancy occurs in the initial state of the emission transition or in the final state in the process of absorption .",
    "the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite was later generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite and is presently known as the mnd ( mahan - nozieres - de dominicis ) theory .",
    "it qualitatively describes the behaviour of the x - ray emission and absorption spectra near @xmath1 , in the range of about @xmath2ev . in refs .",
    "@xcite a number of semi - empirical parameters were introduced , which were chosen to provide the best fit of the theoretical spectrum to the experimental one . in refs .",
    "@xcite a quantitative one - band scheme of the mnd calculation was proposed .",
    "only recently  @xcite , the mnd theory was successfully applied for the calculation of the x - ray absorption spectra of graphite , where the electronic structure obtained from density functional theory ( dft ) calculations was used as an input .",
    "another feature of the xeb of metals , governed by many - electron processes , is a prolonged `` tail '' in the low - energy part of the emission spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it is accepted that this feature is a consequence of the nonradiative auger process in the valence band of the metal .",
    "indeed , the vacancy , appeared in the vb after the x - ray emission transition , can decay due to the auger process characterising by the excitation of one more vb electron into conduction band above the fermi level .",
    "when moving from the fermi level to the bottom of the vb a lifetime of the hole in the final state of the emission transition decreases and the energy width increases .",
    "to date non - empirical _ ab  initio _ treatment of this effect is too complicated and time consuming .",
    "therefore in this study we used a semi - empirical method  @xcite , which allows to reproduce accurately the shape of metal xeb in low - energy range of a spectrum .    according to the original mnd theory , in the free - electron approximation the dynamical screening of a core hole by valence electrons has to affect the shape of l@xmath0 xeb , but should not significantly distort the k - absorption and emission spectra  @xcite . in the case of k - spectra mnd singularity near the fermi level is suppressed because of the orthogonality between the vb many - electron wave function before and after an x - ray transition ( anderson s theorem  @xcite ) . at the same time , in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the mnd effect contributes significantly to the spectral distribution of the absorption coefficient of graphite near the k - threshold of carbon .",
    "however , the experimental k - xeb of carbon in graphite  @xcite does not contain signatures of the mnd singularities .",
    "therefore we calculated the k xeb of graphene to determine the degree of influence of the @xmath3 core hole dynamical screening on the shape of this band .",
    "in this paper we present the results of _ ab  initio _ calculations of xeb accounting for the mnd scattering employing the computational scheme presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . here _",
    "ab _ calculations of the k- and l@xmath4- xeb of the simple metals , as well as k- xeb of carbon in graphene were carried out including the mnd effect for the first time .",
    "the calculated xeb were compared with the experimental results .",
    "let us consider the radiative x - ray transitions of an electron from the band states @xmath5 on the core vacancy , localized on the atom @xmath6 with the quantum numbers @xmath7 . in the tight - binding approximation , neglecting the `` cross '' transition contribution to the intensity of radiation , the xeb intensity @xmath8 can be represented as the sum of the products of the electric dipole probabilities of transition @xmath9 from the atom - like valence band state @xmath10 on the core vacancy and partial density of states @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where the amplitude @xmath14 of transition is given by @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the atomic wave functions of valence electron and core hole , respectively . in the framework of the one - particle approximation",

    "it may be considered as an assumption that the lifetime of the core hole is much smaller than the relaxation time of the system ( an approximation of the final state ) .",
    "another extreme case takes place when the band wave functions are completely changed because of the core hole coulomb potential ( initial state approximation ) .",
    "then the expression for the green s function takes the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are perturbed band energies and wave functions , respectively . for pdos in the presence of the core hole one",
    "gets @xmath27 mnd theory  @xcite considers the core hole filling completely in the dynamical way . the specific calculation scheme , which implements the mnd theory in the framework of one - band model is presented in ref .",

    "@xcite a generalization of this scheme for the multiband x - ray absorption spectra calculations was performed . following the notation of refs .",

    "there are two ways to define input data for the mnd calculations expressed by eqs.([i_mnd])([i_fun ] ) .",
    "the first approach is to use the expressions ( [ g_final ] ) , ( [ g_initial ] ) , and ( [ core_potential ] ) to introduce the green functions @xmath38 and the core potential @xmath39 .",
    "it works well if the band wave functions basis set is large enough .",
    "if it is not the case , the core hole potential @xmath39 depends on energy@xcite . to minimize the error caused by the energy dependence of the potential",
    "one can use a second approach .",

    "the auger process in the vb ( radiationless decay of a hole state ) can affect the k- and l - edge xeb of the metals .",
    "it leads to the suppression of the intensity at the bottom of the vb . as a result",
    "a tightened low - energy tail appears .",
    "indeed , the initial state just before the emission process is characterized by a vacancy in the atomic core shell , which is filled by radiative transition of an vb electron .",
    "the resulting vacancy in the vb can be filled by auger transition of an electron from the high - lying occupied vb states and the released energy is transferred to an auger electron , which is excited into an empty state of the conduction band .",
    "the additional decay channel decreases the lifetime of the valence hole .",
    "therefore the natural width of the vb vacancy is increased .",
    "such mechanism of the vb hole states decay is especially important in metallic systems where there are no energy gaps .",
    "actually , this effect is implemented by the additional convolution of the spectrum @xmath8 with the lorentzian function @xmath44 , which full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) depends on energy . following the described mechanism of vb hole decomposition we conclude that fwhm , @xmath45 , is increased with the difference @xmath46 .",
    "usually this dependence is approximated by a quadratic function  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a semi - empirical fitting parameter . in the framework of this approach the xeb including auger correction @xmath49",
    "is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 fitting the @xmath48 parameter , which provides the best agreement between theory and experiment , the lifetime of the valence state @xmath52 depending on energy might be obtained @xmath53 this expression is valid away from the fermi level in order to avoid the infinity .",
    "to account for the mnd effect the dft calculations were carried out using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite with plane wave basis set and the generalized gradient approximation parameterized by perdew _ et al . _",

    "the supercells of a ( @xmath54 ) periodicity , containing @xmath55 mg atoms , and a ( @xmath56 ) periodicity , containing @xmath57 al atoms , were used .",
    "the cut - off energy was set to @xmath58ev in both cases , and the @xmath59-mesh sampling of the brillouin zone was as dense as @xmath60 and @xmath61 for mg and al , respectively . in the xes simulations for graphene , the supercell was chosen to be as large as ( @xmath62 ) and consists of the @xmath63 carbon atoms .",

    "the `` z+1 '' approximation was used for the central atom of the supercell .",
    "the perturbed local dos @xmath67 was obtained for an atom in the center of the supercell and containing the hole .",
    "unperturbed dos @xmath68 was obtained using the same band calculation by projecting the kohn - sham band wave functions onto the valence atomic orbital of an atom situated far away from one with core hole . in order to get the appropriate input data for the mnd calculations we used the second approach described in the end of sec.[par2 ] .",

    "the contribution of @xmath85-pdos to l@xmath75 xeb of mg is small .",
    "therefore , the single - electron emission spectrum of mg obtained in the present study is in good agreement with the spectra calculated with dipole transition probabilities from @xmath84- and @xmath85-states of vb  @xcite .    as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ l_mg_many ] and [ l_al_many ] for l@xmath75- xeb , the one - electron approximation poorly describes the features and the shape of the experimental spectra .",

    "this behaviour may be explained by the auger decay of vacancies in vb of the metals  @xcite .",

    "the intensity of k xeb near the fermi level should be somewhat suppressed  @xcite and gradually falls to zero .",
    "indeed , it was shown that the screening valence band states have predominantly @xmath84-character . since x - ray transitions from @xmath84-vb states onto @xmath3 core - hole ( k - xeb ) are forbidden by dipole selection rules , dynamical screening is suppressed by orthogonality .",
    "obviously , this is not the case for l - xeb ( transitions onto @xmath86 core - hole ) . in our approach",

    "in order to account for the influence of the auger effect in the vb of metals on the shape of l@xmath75 xeb , we calculated the convolution ( [ convolution ] ) of mnd xeb with a lorentz function ( [ lorentz ] ) which takes into account the broadening of the valence levels due to existence of the additional auger decay channel .",

    "was taken into account in the range of ( e@xmath91 ,  e@xmath92 - 2ev ) , where e@xmath91 is energy of the bottom of the conduction band of the metal .",
    "this choice of the interval on the one hand allows to exclude from consideration the mnd peak and on the other hand provides a smooth behaviour of the many - electron spectrum at the point of `` switch on '' of the auger effect .",
    "the phenomenological parameter @xmath48 values for l@xmath75- emission band of metallic al and mg are @xmath93ev@xmath94 and @xmath95ev@xmath94 , respectively , and the widths of the valence levels as functions of energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ auger ] . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ auger ] the probability of the auger process in the vb of magnesium is larger compared to aluminium for the states with the same energy .",
    "however , due to significantly greater width of the vb and the l@xmath75 xeb of aluminium , the auger effect has a more pronounced influence on the shape of low - energy part of the al l@xmath75 xeb .",
    "this estimation of the widths is correct only for @xmath84-states since only these states form the bottom of the crystal vb  @xcite .",
    "indeed , contribution of @xmath85-states to the low energy parts of the vb and to the intensity of low energy part of mg and al l@xmath75 xeb is negligibly low . as follows from figs .",
    "[ l_mg_many ] and [ l_al_many ] , auger process significantly distort the shape of l - spectra of metals , but its influence on mg and al k xeb is very low if not negligible .",
    "this may be due to low density of @xmath96-states in the vb  @xcite .",
    "calculated single - electron k - xeb themselves form tight `` tails '' in the low - energy part of the spectra ( @xmath97 ) , so the effect of the additional auger broadening leads only to a slight delay in the `` tail '' while the low - energy region of l - spectra is deformed significantly .",
    "such behaviour of @xmath96-pdos and single - electron k - xeb in the low - energy part of the distributions may mask the distortions introduced by the realization of the auger process in the vb .",
    "it is clear , however , if the auger - process in the valence band is indeed possible it should take place for the initial states of any symmetry including the @xmath96-states .",
    "therefore the absence of the requirement to introduce corrections for this many - electron effect into the k - xeb of magnesium and aluminium casts some doubt on the universality of the auger mechanism of the decay of the final states of electron transitions from the valence band to the core shell vacancies of atoms in metals .",
    "as was already mentioned , according to the original theory of mnd scattering in the free - electron approximation , the dynamical screening of the core hole by conduction electrons should not appreciably distort the k xeb and k absorption edge of metallic systems .",
    "however , as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the mnd effect contributes significantly to the spectral distribution of the absorption coefficient of graphite near the c k - absorption threshold . on the other hand , the experimental carbon k - xeb of graphite  @xcite",
    "does not demonstrate any obvious signatures of the mnd singularities .",
    "this asymmetry of mnd scattering has been seemed us rather unexpected and it was decided to check its existence via calculations of the graphene emission and absorption spectra with insertion of the mnd dynamical screening of the carbon @xmath3-hole .    graphite is a set of graphene layers which are shifted relative to each other forming the structure of the abab type .",
    "the interaction between layers is relatively weak and its existence possesses only small influence on the electronic structure of graphite which is almost completely determined by the electronic structure of one graphene layer . for",
    "this reason one can assume that the x - ray spectra of graphene and graphite should be very similar .",
    "k - edge absorption spectrum of graphene was calculated using the method described in ref .",

    "theoretical c k - spectra of graphene were convoluted with a lorentzian function ( fwhm=@xmath90ev , a lifetime width of the c @xmath3 level in graphite  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a convolution with a gaussian of @xmath103ev fwhm for the calculation of the emission band and @xmath104ev for the absorption spectrum have been made in order to account for the instrumental resolution .    in fig .",

    "the mnd effect only slightly distorts the shape of the spectrum near the high - energy edge .",
    "this is not the case when analysing the absorption spectrum : one - electron approximation reproduces only the energy positions of @xmath105 and @xmath106 peaks , but does not describe their relative intensities .",
    "accounting for the mnd scattering significantly improves agreement with experiment .",
    "this so strong asymmetry in the manifestation of the mnd singularities in the absorption and emission is observed for the first time in graphene .",
    "obviously this effect is related to the peculiarities of the band structure of graphene near the fermi level .",
    "indeed , the linear electron dispersion in graphene leads to zero effective mass of electrons with energies close to @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the electronic subsystem instantaneously respond to any small changes in the crystal potential including a core shell vacancy creation caused by the absorption of x - rays .",
    "the suddenly appearing vacancy attracts a screening cloud of conduction electrons , which are excited from the occupied states below the fermi energy into the conduction band states above it .",
    "this local increase in the unoccupied dos near @xmath21 , in which the core electrons can be optically excited , leads to appearance of the mnd singularity in the absorption spectrum of graphene .",
    "in other words , the near edge x - ray photon absorption takes place in a dynamical screening of carbon @xmath3 vacancy conditions . in the emission spectrum",
    "a core hole ( the initial state of the radiative decay ) is almost completely screened due to the high mobility of the conduction electrons near the dirac point .",
    "therefore the radiative x - ray transition arises in the conditions of the almost complete static screening of the @xmath3-vacancy and does not influenced by the dynamical mnd scattering .",
    "this effect may be important in characterization of the conduction electrons dynamics , their mobility and the characteristic relaxation times in graphene - like systems .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ c_k ] that neither one - electron nor mnd spectra do not describe experimental @xmath107 peak of the k absorption of graphene .",
    "the detailed discussion of this phenomenon was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite briefly , this comes from the fact that the @xmath107 peak is due to nonexcitonic states , which are delocalized .",
    "therefore it can not be described neither by mnd theory ( which take into account only exitonic states ) nor by final - state one - electron approximation ( in the static core - hole field ) . on the other hand , this peak can be taken into account by initial - state one - electron approximation  @xcite .",
    "in order to account for the influence of the many - electron effects of the core hole dynamical screening by valence electrons on the shape of characteristic xeb of metals we combined mnd theory with the _ ab  initio _ electronic structure calculations of crystals .",
    "auger effect in the valence band was taken into account in a phenomenological way . within these approaches",
