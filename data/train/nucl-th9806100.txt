    "the newly established electron and photon facilities have made it possible to investigate the mechanism of vector meson photoproductions on nucleons with much improved experimental accuracy .",
    "this has been motivated in part by the puzzle that the nrqm  @xcite predicts a much richer resonance spectrum than has been observed in @xmath7 scattering experiments .",
    "quark model studies have suggested that those resonances missing in the @xmath8 channel may couple strongly to , for example , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels .",
    "experiments have been performed at elsa  @xcite and will be done at tjnaf in the near future  @xcite . therefore , a theory on the reaction mechanism that highlights the dynamical role of s - channel resonances is crucial in order to establish the  missing resonances \" in the forthcoming experimental data for the vector meson , in particular @xmath2 and @xmath5 , photoproductions .",
    "the experimental and theoretical studies on vector meson photoproductions have been a long history since the first experiment carried out on the cambridge electron accelerator in 1964 .",
    "there have been some experimental data of the vector meson photoproductions in their threshold regions where the s - channel resonances are expected to play an important role , for instance , the data from ref.@xcite for the @xmath2 and @xmath5 photoproduction ( @xmath11 1.11gev ) , and the data from ref.@xcite for the @xmath6 photoproduction ( @xmath11 1.57gev ) . historically , these studies have concentrated on the diffactive behavior in the small @xmath4 region for the neutral meson ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath6 ) productions , in which it has been shown that the vector meson dominance model ( vmd )  @xcite gives a good description in the low energy region , while the pomeron exchange becomes more important as the energy increases@xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is not on the large diffractive behavior in the small @xmath4 region , but rather on the non - diffractive s- and u- channel contributions in the large @xmath4 region in which the t - channel pomeron exchange becomes less significant .",
    "furthermore , we will attempt to provide a unified framework for both neutral and charged vector meson productions . since the t - channel exchanges responsible for",
    "the large diffractive behavior in the small @xmath4 region , such as the pomeron exchange , does not contribute to the charged meson productions , the non - diffractive s- and u - channel resonances become more dominant , thus they provide a crucial test to any model that concentrates on the role of the s- and u - channel resonances in the vector meson photoproductions .",
    "the quark model approach provides an ideal framework to investigate the dynamical role of the s- and u - channel resonances in the vector meson photoproductions .",
    "the studies in the pseudoscalar photoproductions have shown@xcite that every s- and u - channel resonance , particularly those high partial wave resonances such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , can be taken into account , and this has been proven to be very difficult for the traditional approach at the hadronic level .",
    "moreover , it introduces the quark degrees of freedom directly into the reaction mechanism , thus gives a very good description to the pseudoscalar meson productions with much less parameters than the models at the hadronic level .",
    "it is therefore natural to extend this approach to the vector meson photoproductions in the resonance region .",
    "a major difference for the vector meson production from the pseudoscalar meson case in the quark model is that the interaction between the vector mesons and the quarks inside the baryon is largely unknown .",
    "although phenomenological models have been developed to evaluate baryon resonance decaying into a nucleon and a vector meson , such as the quark pair creaction model  @xcite or the @xmath14 model , these approaches are unsuitable for the description of vector meson photoproductions .",
    "this is due to the fact that they only yield transition amplitudes for s - channel resonances , but contain no information on how to derive the non - resonant terms in the u- and t - channels .",
    "therefore , we choose an effective lagrangian here as our starting point that satisfies the fundamental symmetries and determines the transition amplitudes not only in the s - channel but also in the u- and t- channels .",
    "even though the effective lagrangians are different from each other for pseudoscalar and vector meson photoproductions , the implementation follows the same guidelines .",
    "the transition amplitudes for each resonance in the s - channel below 2 gev will be included explicitly , while the resonances above 2 gev for a given quantum number @xmath15 in the harmonic oscillator basis of the quark model are treated as degenerate , so that their transition amplitudes can be written in a compact form .",
    "similarly , the excited resonances in the u - channel are assumed to be degenerate as well .",
    "only the mass splitting between the spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 resonances with @xmath16 in the harmonic oscillator basis , such as the splitting between nucleon and @xmath17 resonance , is found to be significant , thus , the transition amplitudes for the spin 3/2 resonance with @xmath16 in the u - channel will be included separately .",
    "the effective lagrangian employed here generates not only the s- and u - channel exchanges but also a t - channel term containing the vector meson exchange .",
    "for charged vector mesons gauge invariance also mandates a seagull term .",
    "although in principle , all the contributions from resonances have been included in the effective lagrangian , we do nt expect that such an approach can give an agreement with the data in the small @xmath4 region in the neutral vector meson photoproductions since additional t - channel contribution , such as the pomeron exchange , will responsible for the strong diffractive behavior in the small @xmath4 region . as it has been shown in ref.@xcite and also in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite about the diffraction duality , there can be a non - resonant imaginary background amplitude in neutral vector meson , such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 photoproductions , but not in the charged vector meson @xmath18 photoproductions .",
    "therefore , the large difference of the cross section between the neutral and charged @xmath5 meson photoproduction , observed in the direct channel resonance region , is due to such a background amplitude , and it should be from the large contribution of the pomeron singularity in the neutral photoproduction from high energies down to the threshold .",
    "this has been one of our concerns in the numerical investigations .",
    "therefore , we add a t - channel @xmath0 exchange to the amplitude for @xmath2 photoproduction and a @xmath1 exchange term to the amplitude for @xmath3 photoproduction suggested by friman and soyeur  @xcite who showed these two terms play dominant roles in @xmath2 and @xmath3 productions respectively , over other meson exchange processes near the threshold .    with the above considerations ,",
    "we apply our model to the five isospin channels , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . with the same set of parameters introduced in our model",
    ", we obtained an overall agreement with the differential cross sections in the large @xmath4 region for the first four channels , while with relatively smaller parameters in the @xmath6 photoproduction , we predict the behavior of the differential cross section in the large @xmath4 region . with the additional t - channel @xmath0 and @xmath1 exchanges included in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 photoproduction respectively ,",
    "we obtain an overall agreement with the available data from small @xmath4 to large @xmath4 region . the overall agreement between the theoretical predictions and the data available not only for the neutral meson @xmath2 and @xmath3 but also for the charged meson @xmath18 productions in which the s- and",
    "u - channel contributions become more dominant is remarkable .",
    "it is even more remarkable that both @xmath2 and @xmath5 productions can be described by the same set of parameters , which is by no means trivial .",
    "it suggests that quark model approach provides a very good framework to investigate the resonance structure in the vector meson photoproductions .",
    "our results also show that polarization observables is crucial in determining the resonance structure , which has been shown to be the case in the pseudoscalar meson photoproductions .    in the reaction @xmath23 .",
    "since the threshold energy of the @xmath6 production is above the resonance region , the primary focus here is the @xmath24 coupling constant . because the production of @xmath25 from the nucleons should be suppressed under the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule , the @xmath24 coupling constant is expected to be smaller than the @xmath26 or @xmath27 couplings .",
    "the recent experiment on the @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) @xcite has shown a significant violation of the ozi rule , and it can not be explained by the diffractive process , such as pomeron exchange .",
    "thus , large contributions from the non - diffractive processes are expected to contribute to the @xmath6 photoproduction near the threshold .",
    "this has been the subject of many studies , such as the recently developed quantum hadrodynamical(qhd ) model approach@xcite . in our framework , it could be achieved by fitting the s- and u- channel contributions to the differential cross sections of @xmath6 productions in the large @xmath4 region@xcite , where the contributions from the pomeron exchange become less significant .",
    "the initial results show that the @xmath24 couplings in the quark model are small but significant which is consistent with those in the qhd approach .    in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly discuss some of the observables used in our approach , which have been developed extensively in ref .",
    "the framework for the vector meson photorpductions with effective lagrangian for the quark - meson interaction is presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we show our numerical studies of the @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 photoproductions in the five isospin channels .",
    "finally , conclusions will be presented in section 5 .",
    "before presenting our quark model approach we introduce some general features of vector meson photoproduction on the nucleon . the basic amplitude @xmath30 for @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the momenta of the incoming photon and outgoing vector meson .",
    "the helicity states are denoted by @xmath35 for the incident photon , @xmath36 for the outgoing vector meson , and @xmath37,@xmath38 for the initial and final state nucleons , respectively .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the amplitude @xmath30 can be expressed as a @xmath39 matrix in the helicity space , @xmath40 because of the parity conservation , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the jacob - wick(jw ) convention , the @xmath44 in eq.([2 ] ) reduces to 12 independent complex helicity amplitudes :    @xmath45    each experimental observable @xmath46 can be written in the general _ bilinear helicity product_(bhp ) form , @xmath47 for example , the differential cross section operator is given by : @xmath48 where the box frames denote the diagonal structure of the matrices .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath2 matrices labeled by different @xmath50 and @xmath51 correspond to different spin observables . with the phase space factor",
    ", the differential cross section has the expression , @xmath52 in the center of mass frame , where @xmath53 is the total energy of the system , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the energies of the nucleons in the initial and final states , respectively .",

    "system , and @xmath68 and @xmath6 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the @xmath69 which is produced by the @xmath3 decay in the @xmath3 rest frame .",
    "the starting point of the quark model approach is the effective lagrangian , @xmath70 where the quark field @xmath71 is expressed as @xmath72 and the meson field @xmath73 is a 3@xmath743 matrix , @xmath75 in which the vector mesons are treated as point - like particles . at tree level , the transition matrix element based on the effective lagrangian in eq.([3.0 ] ) can be written as the sum of contributions from the s- , u- and t- channels , @xmath76 where the s- and u - channel contributions in eq.([3.1 ] ) have the following form , @xmath77 and the quark - meson coupling vertex is @xmath78 where @xmath79 in is the quark mass and the constants @xmath80 and @xmath81 in eq.([3.0 ] ) and ( [ hm ] ) are the vector and tensor coupling constants , which will be treated as free parameters in our approach .",
    "the initial and final states of the nucleon are denoted by @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , and @xmath84 is the intermediate resonance state while @xmath54 and @xmath85 are the energies of the inital nucleon and the intermediate resonance .",
    "an important test of the transition matrix elements @xmath86 would be gauge invariance : @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 are the polarization vectors of the vector mesons and photons .",
    "however , we find that the condition @xmath90 is not satisfied for the t - channel vector meson exchange term , @xmath91 based on the feynman rules for the photon - vector meson coupling , and the relation @xmath92 to remedy this problem , we add a gauge fixing term , so that @xmath93    the techniques of deriving the transition amplitudes have been developed for compton scattering  @xcite .",
    "follow the same procedure as given in eq.(14 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can divide the photon interaction into two parts and the contributions from the s- and u- channel can be rewritten as : @xmath94|n_i\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\    & & + i\\omega\\sum_{j}\\langle n_f|h_m|n_j\\rangle\\langle     n_j|\\frac{1}{e_i+\\omega - e_j}h_e|n_i\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\    & & + i\\omega\\sum_{j } \\langle n_f|h_e\\frac{1}{e_i-\\omega_m - e_j }      \\label{3.2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97    the first term in eq.([3.2 ] ) can be identified as a seagull term ; it is proportional to the charge of the outgoing vector meson . the second and third term in eq.([3.2 ] ) represents the s- and u - channel contributions . adopting the same strategy as in the pseudoscalar case",
    ", we include a complete set of helicity amplitudes for each of the s - channel resonances below 2gev in the @xmath98 symmetry limit .",
    "the resonances above 2gev are treated as degenerate in order to express each contribution from all resonances with quantum number @xmath15 in a compact form .",
    "the contributions from the resonances with the largest spin for a given quantum number @xmath15 were found to be the most important as the energy increases  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to spin @xmath99 with @xmath100 for the reactions @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and @xmath103 with @xmath104 for the reactions @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "similar to the pseudoscalar case , the contributions from the u - channel resonances are divided into two parts as well .",
    "the first part contains the resonances with the quantum number @xmath16 , which includes the spin 1/2 states , such as the @xmath107 , @xmath108 and the nucleons , and the spin 3/2 resonances , such as the @xmath109 in @xmath110 photoproduction and @xmath111 resonance in @xmath5 photoproduction .",
    "because the mass splitting between the spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 resonances for @xmath16 is significant , they have to be treated separately .",
    "the transition amplitudes for these u - channel resonances will also be written in terms of the helicity amplitudes .",
    "the second part comes from the excited resonances with quantum number @xmath112 .",

    "before discussing the details of the @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 productions , it should be pointed out that the nonrelativistic wave function in the quark model becomes more inadequate as the energy of the system increases . a procedure to partly remedy this problem is to introduce the lorentz boost factor in the spatial integrals that involve the spatial wavefunctions of nucleons and baryon resonances , @xmath228 where @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "a similar procedure had been used in the numerical evaluation of pseudoscalar meson photoproduction@xcite .",
    "there are two overall parameters from the quark model formalism ; the quark mass @xmath79 and the parameter @xmath50 related to the harmonic oscillator strength , and we adopt the values commonly used in the quark model approach for these parameters , @xmath231 now , we turn our attention to the details of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath18 and @xmath6 photoproductions .      the t - channel exchange of @xmath232 in eq.([3.1 ] ) would correspond to @xmath2 exchange which is absent since the amplitude is proportional to the charge of the outgoing @xmath2 meson . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0 exchange is dominant in the small @xmath4 region over other meson exchanges and largely responsible for the large diffractive scattering behavior near the threshold .",
    "the lagrangian for the @xmath0 exchange model has the following form  @xcite , @xmath233 for the @xmath234 coupling vertex , and @xmath235 for the @xmath236 coupling vertex , where the @xmath237 and @xmath0 represent the @xmath2 and @xmath0 fields , the @xmath238 denotes the electromagnetic field , and @xmath239 is the levi - civita tensor , and @xmath240 is the mass of @xmath2 meson . the @xmath241 and @xmath242 in eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) denote the coupling constants at the two vertices , respectively .",
    "therefore , the transition amplitudes of t - channel @xmath0 exchange have the following expression , @xmath243 for the transverse transition , and @xmath244 for the longitudinal transition , where @xmath2 in the transition amplitudes denotes the energy of the photon with momentum @xmath33 , and @xmath245 , and @xmath246 .",
    "the factor @xmath247 in eqs .",
    "( [ t ] ) and ( [ l ] ) is the form factor for both @xmath234 and @xmath248 vertices , if we assume that the wavefunctions for nucleon , @xmath2 and @xmath249 have a gaussian form .",
    "the constant @xmath250 in this form factor is treated as a parameter .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath241 and @xmath242 have the values as used in @xcite . therefore , @xmath251 note that the values of @xmath252 and @xmath253 were fixed by separate experiments and , therefore , are not free parameters in ref.@xcite .",
    "qualitatively , we would expect that @xmath254 be smaller than the parameter @xmath255 mev , since it represents the combined form factors for both @xmath234 and @xmath236 vertices while the parameter @xmath50 only corresponds to the form factor for the @xmath234 or @xmath26 vertex alone .",
    "following the same procedure as in section 2 , the explicit expressions for the operators in terms of the helicity amplitudes can be obtained .",
    "they are listed in tables 2 and 3 for the transverse and longitudinal amplitudes , respectively .    as shown in table 4 .",

    "of course , configuration mixing will lead to additional contributions from these resonances which , however , can not be determined at present due to the poor quality of data . only the resonances @xmath259 and @xmath260 , at present classified as 2-star resonances in the 1996 pdg listings , have masses above the @xmath2 decay threshold , and therefore have branching ratio into the @xmath9 channel .",
    "we have not performed a rigorous numerical fit to the available data because of the poor quality of the data .",

    "@xcite though the form factor in our calculation is different .",
    "1 clearly demonstrates that the t - channel @xmath0 exchange is dominant in the small @xmath4 region , while the s- and u - channel resonance contributions become more important as the momentum transfer @xmath4 increases . to test the sensitivity of s - channel resonances to the differential cross section",
    ", the differential cross section without the contribution from the resonance @xmath260 at 1.675 gev ( near the threshold of @xmath260 ) is presented in fig .",
    "1-(c ) as well .",
    "the results indicate that the differential cross section data alone are not sufficient to determine the presence of this resonance considering the theoretical and experimental uncertainties . since our numerical calculation shows that the resonance couplings of the @xmath260 are larger than those of other resonances in this mass region , the sensitivity of the differential cross section to other resonances around 2 gev is even smaller .",
    "in contrast to the differential cross section , the polarization observables show a much more dramatic dependence on the presence of the s - channel resonances .",
    "we present results of four single polarizations at 1.7 gev in fig .",
    "2 . the absence of the resonance @xmath260 leads to a sign change in the target polarization , and the variations in the recoil as well as the meson polarization observable are very significant as well .",
    "the absence of the resonance @xmath259 , also shown in fig .",
    "2 , leads to very significant changes in the recoil polarization .",
    "although we do not expect our numerical results to give a quantitative prediction of polarization observables at the present stage , since the calculations are limited to the @xmath98 symmetry limit that should be broken in more realistic quark model wavefunction , our results clearly suggest that the polarization observables may be the best place to determine s - channel resonance properties .",
    "our results for the total cross section are shown in fig .",
    "3 , in which the contributions from the s- and u - channel resonances alone are compared to the full calculation . our results indicate an increasing discrepancy between theory and the data  @xcite with increasing energy @xmath263 , this discrepancy comes mainly from the small angle region where the @xmath0 exchange alone is not sufficient to describe the diffractive behavior at higher energies .",
    "one might expect that pomeron exchange@xcite plays a more important role in the higher energy region",
    ". however , fig .",
    "1 shows that our results for the differential cross section at the large angle region are in good agreement with the data , and it suggests that contributions from the s- and u- channel resonances which are the main focus of our study , give an appropriate description of the reaction mechanism .",
    "it is interesting to note that the small bump around 1.7 gev in the total cross section comes from the contributions of the resonance @xmath260 . as discussed above , our calculations find that the resonance @xmath260 has a strong coupling to the @xmath9 channel .",
    "thus , this resonance is perhaps the best candidate whose existance as a  missing \" resonance can be established through @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "@xmath3 meson photoproduction has some similar features as @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "the most significant one is that it also has strong - forward - peaking diffractive behavior in the differential cross section .",
    "the t - channel vector meson exchange is proportional to the meson charge in ( [ 3.1 ] ) , therefore has no contributions to the transition amplitudes .",
    "however , since @xmath5 meson is an isovector , its photoproduction has also shown some different characters from @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "there are more s - channel resonances , such as the @xmath17 resonances , will contribute to the @xmath3 productions due to the isospin couplings .    from the lagrangian introduced in our quark model approach , the amplitudes from s- and u - channel are not sufficient to reproduce the diffractive behavior in the small @xmath4 region .",
    "following what we have discussed at the beginning of this section , it is reasonable to include an additional t - channel meson exchange term in the transition amplitude@xcite . as friman and soyeur@xcite",
    "has discussed in their work that @xmath1 meson plays dominant role over other t - channel processes in the @xmath3 photoproduction . as a phenomenological approach , @xmath1 exchange",
    "is included to give the small @xmath4 diffractive behavior which can be understood as the still sizable contribution from the pomeron exchange from high energies down to the threshold@xcite .",
    "in terms of regge phenomenology , it corresponds to the nontrivial background integral of the regge trajectory expansion@xcite which contributes to the diffractive behavior at small @xmath4 region .",
    "however , we have to mention that , only the resonance contributions have been taken into account consistently , could the proper large @xmath4 behavior be described .",
    "the followings are the transverse and longitudinal transition amplitudes of @xmath1 exchange , @xmath265 @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the form factor for t - channel @xmath1 exchange .",
    "@xmath268 is treated as the parameter . @xmath269 and @xmath270 are the coupling constants of the vertex @xmath271 and @xmath272 , respectively , which are determined by the experimental analysis . as a phenomenological freedom , the mass of @xmath1 meson @xmath273 has the same values as in @xcite , @xmath274gev .",
    "@xmath269 and @xmath270 have the following values , @xmath275    numerical investigation indicates that @xmath0 exchange contribution in @xmath3 photoproduction is so small that can be neglected in the first order approximation . with the same values for parameter @xmath80 and @xmath276 , we fit the differential cross sections , total cross section and the single spin polarizations in @xmath20 . for @xmath277 , there are 27 resonances given by the quark model .",
    "however , moorhouse selection rule will eliminate those belonging to the representation @xmath278_1,\\quad [ { \\bf 70 } , 0^+]_2 $ ] and @xmath257_2 $ ] , in which there are @xmath279 and @xmath280 belonging to @xmath278_1 $ ] , but those belonging to @xmath281_2 $ ] and @xmath257_2 $ ] have not been determined very well in experiments .",
    "the experimental data from@xcite have been reproduced in our model at @xmath2821.225 , 1.305 , 1.4 , 1.545 , 1.730 , 1.925gev for the differential cross sections .",
    "we find that the same set of parameters in the @xmath2 could also be used to describe the @xmath5 productions as well .",
    "the additional parameter @xmath283 is found to be @xmath284 the fact that both @xmath2 and @xmath3 productions can be described by the same set of the parameters is by no means trivial .",
    "it shows the advantage of the introduction of the quark degrees of freedom so that the @xmath2 and @xmath5 can be described by a unified framework , moreover , the isospin mixings between @xmath2 and @xmath5 is small and they have very similar masses .",
    "although the @xmath1 exchange dominates in the small @xmath4 region , s- and u - channel contributions play obviously important roles in the large @xmath4 region .",
    "in fact , it is the s- and u - channel contributions that result in the backward peaking behavior which is similar to the compton scattering phenomenon@xcite . in fig4 .",
    ", the individual results from @xmath1 exchange and s- and u - channel are presented as well .",
    "it shows that the cross sections are mainly from the diffractive process .",
    "moreover , since the number of contributing resonances is large , the contribution effects from individual resonance are not significant .",
    "that is to say , it is quite impossible to derive the resonance informations from the differential cross sections .",
    "the polarization results are provided in fig 5 .",
    "much attention has been paid to the  missing resonance \" @xmath260 .",
    "it shows that the polarization observables are quite sensitive to the presence of this state , especially in the recoil polarization and meson polarization .",
    "double spin polarization investigations are in progress in our framework and they should be more sensitive to the resonances .    in fig 6 .",
    "all available data@xcite for @xmath20 are present . with the same set of parameters ,",
    "the theoretical result give a good description of the experimental data .",
    "in fig 6 . the dotted line denotes the contributions from s- and u- channel which shows that the cross section of producing @xmath3 through resonance channel is quite small in contrast with that through diffractive process .",
    "this also explains the reason that the effects of an individual resonance is not significant in the differential cross sections .      in the charge",
    "meson productions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the three channels s- , u- and t- have contributions to the transition amplitudes .",
    "the charge exchange process has eliminated contributions from such diffractive behaviors as in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 photoproductions while the t - channel charged vector meson exchange and the seagull term will account for the small forward peaking shapes of the differential cross sections , and this is also required by the duality hypothesis when we have taken the contributions from all the s- and u - channel processes into account .",
    "therefore , the charged meson productions provides an important test of this approach , as every term in these two reactions are generated by the effective lagrangian , and there is no additional free parameters .    in @xmath22 , for the moorhouse selection rule at the photon interaction vertex ,",
    "those resonances belonging to @xmath278_1,\\quad [ { \\bf 70 } , 0^+]_2 $ ] and @xmath257_2 $ ] are eliminated from contributing to the amplitudes .",
    "but in @xmath21 , without the constraint from moorhouse selection rule , more resonances have contributions to the amplitudes .",
    "as we have shown in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 photoproductions , the same set of parameters @xmath80 and @xmath276 gives an overall agreement with the available data , the challenge is that whether we can reproduce the data@xcite in the @xmath18 channels with the same parameters , because they possess the same isospin symmetry .",
    "this should be one crucial test for the model .",
    "as expected , the data in the reaction @xmath21 are in very good agreement with the quark model predictions , indicating that the quark model wave functions appear to provide the correct relative strengths and phases among the terms in the s- , u- and t - channels . in fig",
    ", the experimental data for @xmath21 from ref.@xcite are presented at @xmath286gev , which is the average of the measurement realm . in fig .",
    "7(b ) . , we present the prediction of the differential cross section in @xmath22 , and it shows a similar behavior as in @xmath21 .    in fig .",
    ", the total cross sections for @xmath18 @xcite are presented . in fig .",
    "8(a ) , the cross section of @xmath287 photoproduction with @xmath288 is well reproduced , along which the total cross section is also consistent with the experimental estimation@xcite .",
    "the prediction of the total cross section of @xmath289 photoproduction is given in fig .",
    "while the shapes and magnitudes of the differential cross sections are well reproduced within our approach we find little sensitivity to individual resonances .",
    "for example , in the energy region of @xmath290gev , removing the @xmath260 state - one of the  missing \" candidates - changes the cross section very little , indicating the differential cross section may not be the ideal experimental observable to study the structure of the baryon resonances .",
    "in contrast to the cross sections , the polarization observables show a more dramatic dependence on the presence of the s - channel resonances . to illustrate their effects , as an example , the target polarizations for @xmath287 and @xmath289 production with and without the contribution from the @xmath260 resonance are shown in fig .",
    "we do not expect the quark model in the @xmath98 limit to provide a good description of these observables .",
    "however , it demonstrates the sensitivity of these observables to the presence of s - channel resonances .",
    "this shows that polarization observables are essential in analyzing the role of s - channel resonances .",
    "because the isospin of the @xmath6 is the same as that of the @xmath2 , the formalism for the s- and u- channel contributions to the @xmath6 productions should be the same as that of the @xmath2 productions except the different threshold energies .",
    "the major difference between the @xmath2 and the @xmath6 productions is the mechanism of generating @xmath291 ( @xmath160 ) and @xmath292 ( @xmath293 ) quarks for the @xmath2 productions and the @xmath294 and @xmath295 quarks for the @xmath6 production that are suppressed by the ozi rule .",
    "such a difference will be reflected in the difference of the coupling constants between @xmath2 and @xmath6 productions , of which the coupling constant for the @xmath24 vertex is expected to be much smaller than that for the @xmath26 vertex .",
    "thus , we shall concentrate on the non - diffractive effects generated from the effective lagrangian in the s- and u - channel reaction .",
    "since we have not included the pomeron exchange term to give the strong diffractive behavior in the small @xmath4 region , our results thus could only be regarded as an estimation .",
    "the numerical results with the following two sets of parameters are shown in comparison with the data@xcite in fig.10 .",
    "they represent the @xmath296 coupling constants in the non - diffractive processes of the @xmath6 production , @xmath297 and @xmath298 it should be note that the same value of @xmath50 as that in the @xmath2 production has been used in the evaluations at present stage .",
    "our results show that the differential cross sections are very senstive to the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath276 in the large @xmath4 region , where the pomeron exchange is expected to be small .",
    "thus , the data in the large @xmath4 region could provide an important constraint to the @xmath24 coupling constants .",
    "moreover , the coupling constants in eqs .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) are indeed significantly smaller than those for the @xmath2 photoproductions in eq.([omega ] ) .",
    "these results are also consistent with those obtained in the qhd approach@xcite .",
    "in this paper we have developed the framework and formalism for the description of the vector meson photoproductions in the constituent quark model .",
    "consequently , the application of this approach to the @xmath2 and @xmath5 meson photoproductions have produced very encouraging results .",
    "the use of an effective lagrangian allows the gauge invariance to be satisfied straightforwardly .",
    "the advantage of using the quark model approach is that the number of free parameters is greatly reduced in comparison with hadronic models which introduce each resonance as a new independent field with unknown coupling constants . in our approach ,",
    "only three parameters appear in the @xmath98 symmetry limit , the coupling constants @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( or @xmath276 ) which determine the coupling strengths of the vector meson to the quark , and the harmonic oscillator strength @xmath50 .    with @xmath0 and @xmath1 exchange taken into account ,",
    "an overall description of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath289 and @xmath287 photoproduction with the same set of parameters has been obtained in this framework .",
    "it shows that intermediate resonance contributions have played important roles in the @xmath2 and @xmath5 meson photoproductions especially in large @xmath4 regions .",
    "this shows that our effective lagrangian approach in the quark model has provided an ideal framework to investigate the reaction mechanism and the underlying quark structure of the baryon resonances . the crucial role played by the polarization",
    "observables in determining the s - channel resonance properties is demonstrated .",
    "data on these observables , expected from tjnaf in the near future , should therefore provide new insights into the structure of the resonance @xmath260 as well as other  missing \" resonances .",
    "the introduction of t - channel @xmath0 and @xmath1 exchange in the neutral productions can be quanlitively understood in the picture of the regge phenomenology@xcite or the diffraction duality picture of freund@xcite and harari@xcite .",
    "in such a picture , the large difference of the cross section between @xmath3 and @xmath18 is due to such a background amplitude which originates from a sizable contribution of the pomeron singularity in @xmath3 photoproduction from high energies down to the threshold .",
    "our numerical investigation has really shown the case , therefore , to some extent , suggests that the duality hypothesis@xcite constrains also the vector meson photoproductions .    in the reaction of @xmath6 photoproduction , the sizable non - diffractive contributions can be phenomenologically interpreted as the s- and u- channel contributions generated from the effective lagiangian . further studies that includes the pomeron exchange in this approach will be persued later .",
    "one significant approximation inherent in the presented approach is the treatment of the vector mesons as point particles , thus , the effects due to the finite size of the vector mesons that were important in the @xmath14 model are neglected here . a possible way that may partly compensate",
    "this problem is to adjust the parameter @xmath143 , the harmonic oscillator strength . in general",
    ", the question of how to include the finite size of vector mesons while maintaining the gauge invariance is very complicated and has not yet been resolved . moreover , as configuration mixing effects for the resonances in the second and third resonance region are known to be very important , more precise quantitative agreement with the data can not be derived from the current form . but such effects could be investigated in our approach by inserting a mixing parameter @xmath299 in front of the transition amplitudes for the s - channel resonances , as has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fact that the @xmath2 and @xmath5 productions can be described by the same set of the parameters shows the successes of the quark model appraoch .",
    "thus , the model presented here could provide a systematic method to investigate the resonance behavior in the vector meson photoproductions for the first time , which will help us to identify the  missing resonances \" .",

    "<S> a quark model approach to the photoproduction of vector mesons off nucleons is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> its starting point is an effective lagrangian of the interaction between the vector meson and the quarks inside the baryon , which generates the non - diffractive s- and u- channel resonance contributions . </S>",
    "<S> additional t - channel @xmath0 and @xmath1 exchanges are included for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 production respectively to account for the large diffractive behavior in the small @xmath4 region as suggested by friman and soyeur . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are presented for the @xmath2 and @xmath5 productions in four isospin channels with the same set of parameters , and they are in good agreement with the available data not only in @xmath2 and @xmath3 productions but also in the charged @xmath5 productions where the additional t - channel @xmath1 exchange does not contribute so that it provides an important test to this approach . the investigation is also extended to the @xmath6 photoproduction , and the initial results show that the non - diffractive behavior of the @xmath6 productions in the large @xmath4 region can be described by the s- and u- channel contributions with significantly smaller coupling constants , which is consistent with the findings in the similar studies in the qhd framework . </S>",
