    "in the last few years a new phenomenon has attracted attention of the community of soft condensed matter physicists  appearance of attraction between like charged macromolecules in solutions containing multivalent ions .",
    "the problem is particularly fascinating because it contradicts our well established intuition that like charged entities should repel  @xcite . the fundamental point , however , is that the electrolyte solutions are intrinsically complex systems for which many body interactions play a fundamental role .",
    "the attraction between like charged macromolecules is important for many biological systems .",
    "one particularly striking example is provided by the condensation of dna by multivalent ions such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and various polyamines  @xcite .",
    "this condensation provides an answer to the long standing puzzle of how a highly charged macromolecule , such as the dna , can be confined to a small volume of viral head or nuclear zone in procaryotic cell .",
    "evidently , the multivalent ions serve as a glue which keeps the otherwise repelling like - charged monomers in close proximity  @xcite . in eukaryotic cells , the cytosol is traversed by a network of microtubules and microfilaments  rigid chains of highly charged protein ( f - actin )  which in spite of large negative charge agglomerate to form filaments of cytoskeleton  @xcite .",
    "the actin fibers are also an important part of the muscle tissue , providing a rail track for the motion of molecular motor myosin .",
    "although the nature of attraction between like charged macromolecules is still not fully understood , it seems clear that the attractive force is mediated by the multivalent counterions  @xcite .",
    "a strong electrostatic attraction between the polyions and the oppositely charged multivalent counterions produces a sheath of counterions around each macromolecule .",
    "the condensed counterions can become highly correlated resulting in an overall attraction .",
    "it is important to note that the complex formed by a polyion and its associated counterions does not need to be neutral for the attraction to arise . under some conditions",
    "the correlation induced attraction can overcome the monopolar repulsion coming from the net charge of the complexes .",
    "recently a simple model was presented to account for the attraction between two lines of charges  @xcite .",
    "each line had @xmath3 discrete uniformly spaced monomers of charge @xmath4 , and @xmath5 condensed counterions of charge @xmath6 free to move along the rod .",
    "the net charge of such a polyion - counterion complex is @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , it was found that if @xmath8 and @xmath9 , at sufficiently short distances , the two like - charged rods would attract  @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the attraction resulted from the correlations between the condensed counterions and reached maximum at zero temperature . if @xmath10 the force was always found to be repulsive .",
    "clearly , a one dimensional line of charge is a dramatic oversimplification of the physical reality .",
    "if we are interested in studying the correlation induced forces between real macromolecules their finite radius must be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "thus , a much more realistic model of a polyion is a cylinder with a uniformly charged backbone  @xcite or with an intrinsic charge pattern  @xcite as , e.g. , the helix structure of dna molecule .",
    "furthermore , the condensed counterions do not move along the line , but on the surface of the cylinder . unfortunately , these extended models are much harder to study analytically .    in this paper we explore the effects of finite polyion diameter on the electrostatic interactions between the two polyions using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we find that the finite diameter and the associated angular degrees of freedom of condensed counterions significantly modify the nature of attraction .",
    "thus , although there is still a minimum charge which must be neutralized by the counterions in order for the attraction to appear , this fraction is no longer equal to @xmath11 as was the case for the line of charge model .",
    "we find that the critical fraction depends on the valence of counterions and is less than @xmath11 for @xmath9 . for monovalent counterions",
    "no attraction is found .",
    "the crystalline structure of the condensed counterions , as first suggested by simulations of gronbech - jensen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite , is also not very obvious .",
    "in particular we find very similar distributions of condensed counterions in the regime of attractive and repulsive interactions .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the model and the method of calculation are described in section  [ model ] . in section  [ results ] , we present the results of the simulations .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the dna model considered here is an extension of the one proposed earlier by arenzon , stilck and levin  @xcite .",
    "a similar model has been recently discussed by solis and olvera de la cruz  @xcite .",
    "the polyions are treated as parallel rigid cylinders of radius @xmath12 and @xmath3 ionized groups , each of charge @xmath4 , uniformly spaced  with separation @xmath13  along the principle axis , fig .",
    "[ modelfig ] . besides the fixed monomers ,",
    "each polyion has @xmath5 condensed counterions with valence @xmath14 and charge @xmath6 , which are constrained to move on the surface of the cylinder . to locate a condensed counterion",
    "it is necessary to provide its longitudinal position , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , and the transversal angle , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . to simplify the calculations , the angular and the longitudinal degrees of freedom",
    "are discretized , see fig .",
    "[ modelfig ] .",
    "the surface of the cylinder is subdivided into @xmath3 parallel rings with a charged monomer at the center of each ring .",

    "[ modelfig ] and [ rings ] .",

    "note that the core charge is always `` occupied '' , while the counterions are free to move between the @xmath29 ring sites of each polyion .",
    "the hamiltonian for the interaction between the two polyions is , @xmath30 with the @xmath31 .",
    "all lengths are measured in units of @xmath13 ( for dna , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the dimensionless quantity , @xmath33 , is the manning parameter , which for dna is @xmath34 .",
    "the partition function is obtained by tracing over all the possible values of @xmath21 consistent with the constraint of fixed number of counterions per polyion , @xmath35 clearly , this is a very crude model of the interaction between two macromolecules in a polyelectrolyte solution .",
    "the molecular nature of the solvent is ignored .",
    "also the number of condensed counterions is fixed instead of being dependent on the separation between the particles . nevertheless , we believe that this simple model can provide some useful insights for the mechanism of attraction in real polyelectrolyte solutions .",
    "= 0.35      we are interested in statistical averages of observables such as the energy and the force between the two polyions . furthermore , to understand the nature of the interaction between the two macromolecules it is essential to study the correlations between the condensed counterions on the two polyions .",

    "only the @xmath37-component is different from zero .    for finite macromolecules the symmetry between the two polyions",
    "can not be broken  @xcite .",
    "hence it is impossible to produce a true crystalline order in a finite system at non - zero temperature . since within our simplified model",
