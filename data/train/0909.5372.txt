    "[ sec : introduction ]    spiral waves are types of self - organization observed in physical @xcite , chemical @xcite , and biological @xcite systems , where wave propagation is supported by a source of energy stored in the medium .",
    "the interest in the dynamics of spiral waves has significantly broadened in the last decade as the development of experimental techniques has permitted them to be observed and studied in an ever increasing number of diverse systems such as magnetic films  @xcite , liquid crystals  @xcite , nonlinear optics  @xcite , novel chemical systems  @xcite , and in subcellular  @xcite , tissue @xcite and population biology  @xcite .    in the ideal unperturbed medium",
    ", the core of a spiral wave may be anywhere , depending on initial conditions .",
    "however , real systems are always subject to a perturbation .",
    "a typical result of a symmetry - breaking perturbation is drift of the spiral waves , which has two components , temporal drift , which is shift of spiral wave rotation frequency , and spatial drift , that is slow movement of the spiral s rotation centre . drift of spiral waves , particularly the spatial drift , is of great practical interest to applications . in cardiac tissue , drift of re - entry circuits may be caused by internal tissue inhomogeneities , or by external perturbations , such as electrical stimulation .",
    "the possibility of control of arrhythmias by weak electrical stimulation has been a subject of intensive research for decades .",
    "understandably , the drift of spiral waves was mostly studied in the bz reaction , which is the easiest excitable system for experimental study , and in the heart tissues and tissue cultures , which represents the most important application area .",
    "examples of drift observed in experiments and numerical simualtions include `` resonant '' drift caused by ( approximately ) periodic modulation of medium properties through external forcing  @xcite , constant uniform electric field that causes electrophoresis of charged ions taking part in the chemical reactions  @xcite , a spatial gradient of medium properties @xcite and pinning ( anchoring , trapping ) to a localized inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "interaction with a localized inhomogeneity can be considered to be a particular case of the general phenomenon of vortex pinning to material defects , ranging from convective microvortex filaments in nanosecond laser - matter interaction to magnetic flux strings in the sun s penumbra  @xcite .",
    "a most intriguing property of spiral waves is that despite being propagating waves affecting all accessible space , they , or rather their cores , behave like point - like objects .",
    "correspondingly , three - dimensional extensions of spiral waves , known as scroll waves , act as string - like objects .",
    "there have been several ad hoc  theories of drift of spiral and scroll waves exploiting incidental features in selected models ,  @xcite .",
    "our present study is based on an asymptotic theory applicable to any reaction - diffusion system of equations in which a rigidly rotating spiral wave solutions exist .",
    "the theory was first proposed for autonomous dynamics of scroll waves for the case of small curvatures and small twists  @xcite and then extended to the drift of spiral waves in response to small perturbations  @xcite . in this theory",
    ", the particle - like behaviour of spirals and string - like behaviour of scrolls corresponds to an effective localization of so called response functions ( rfs , see exact defininition later in this paper ) .",
    "the localization of rfs is the crucial assumption , which underpins the entire analysis .",
    "originally  @xcite this property was only a conjecture based on the phenomenology of spiral waves in experiments and numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the analytical calculation of the response functions appears to be infeasible .",
    "numerical calculations in the barkley model  @xcite and the complex ginzburg - landau equation  @xcite have confirmed that indeed they are essentially localized in the vicinity of the core of the spiral .",
    "the asymptotic theory based on the response functions has been successfully used to quantitatively predict drift of spirals , for resonant drift and drift due to parametric inhomogeneity in the cgle  @xcite and for drift in response to a uniform electric field in barkley model  @xcite . despite this success , so far the asymptotic theory has not become a generally used tool for the prediction of spiral wave drift .",
    "this is partly due to difficulties in the numerical calculation of the response functions . in our recent publication  @xcite",
    "we have presented an efficient numerical method of calculating response functions in an arbitrary model with differentiable right - hand sides .",
    "the complexity of calculating response functions with this method is similar to the complexity of calculating spiral wave solutions themselves . in the present paper ,",
    "we describe the application of the asymptotic theory using the response functions for the prediction of several types of drift and show how it works for two of the most popular generic excitable models , the fitzhugh - nagumo system  @xcite , and the barkley system  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that predictions of the asymptotic theory are in good quantitative agreement with direct numerical simulations .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate that the response functions are capable of predicting nontrivial qualitative phenomena , such as attachment of spiral waves to stepwise inhomogeneity and orbital movement around a localized inhomogeneity .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we briefly recapitulate the asymptotic theory of the drift of spiral waves in response to small perturbation and present explicit expressions for drift parameters in terms of the spiral wave s response functions for several sorts of drift . in section",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we describe the numerical methods used for calculating the response functions , for direct numerical simulations , and for processing of the results . the results are described in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude the paper by discussion of the results and their implications in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "[ sec : theory ]      we consider reaction - diffusion partial differential equations , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a column - vector of the reagent concentrations , @xmath3 is a column - vector of the reaction rates , @xmath4 is the matrix of diffusion coefficients , and @xmath5 is the vector of coordinates on the plane .",
    "a rigidly clockwise rotating spiral wave solution to the system ( [ rds ] ) has the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the center of rotation , @xmath8 is the initial rotation phase , and @xmath9 are polar coordinates centered at @xmath10 . for a steady , rigidly rotating spiral ,",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath8 are constants .",
    "the system of reference co - rotating with the spiral s initial phase and angular velocity @xmath11 around the spiral s center of rotation is called the system of reference of the spiral . in this system of reference ,",
    "the polar angle is given by @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in this frame , the spiral wave solution @xmath15 does not depend on time and satisfies the equation @xmath16 where the unknowns are the field @xmath15 and the scalar @xmath11 .    in a slightly perturbed problem @xmath17 where @xmath18 is some small perturbation , spiral waves may drift ,  change rotational phase and/or center location .",
    "then , the center of rotation and the initial phase are no longer constants but become functions of time , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the co - rotating system of reference , time dependence will take form of a phase depending on time @xmath21 .",
    "thus , we consider three systems of reference :    1 .",
    "laboratory , : :    @xmath22 ; 2 .",

    "we shall look for a solution to ( [ rds_pert ] ) in the form of a slightly perturbed steady spiral wave solution @xmath28 where @xmath29 .    then , assuming that @xmath30 at leading order in @xmath31 , the solution perturbation @xmath32 will satisfy the linearized system    @xmath33    where @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the perturbation @xmath36 , considered in the co - rotating frame of reference .",
    "the linearized operator @xmath37 has critical ( @xmath38 ) eigenvalues @xmath39 which correspond to eigenfunctions related to equivariance of ( [ rds ] ) with respect to translations and rotations ,  `` goldstone modes '' ( gms ) @xmath40 in this paper we do not consider perturbations @xmath36 that depend on @xmath41 other than @xmath42-periodically ( for a more general version of the theory free from this assumption see @xcite ) .",
    "then @xmath35 is a @xmath43-periodic function in @xmath44 , and we look for solutions @xmath45 to equation ( [ g_eqn_1 ] ) with the same periodicity .",
    "a solvability condition leads to the following system of equations for the drift velocities , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the complex coordinate of the instant spiral centre , the inner product @xmath48 stands for the scalar product in functional space @xmath49 and the kernels @xmath50 , @xmath51 , are the response functions , that is the critical eigenfunctions @xmath52 of the adjoint operator @xmath53 , @xmath54 chosen to be biorthogonal @xmath55 to the goldstone modes ( [ goldstone ] ) .",
    "the drift velocities can be written as ( henceforth we shall drop the @xmath56 terms ) @xmath57 where the `` forces '' @xmath58 and @xmath59 are defined by @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the above formulae , the dependence on @xmath62 is explicitly included to emphasize that the response functions depend on coordinates @xmath63 in the corotating frame of reference whereas the perturbations are typically defined in the laboratory frame of reference , and the two systems of references are related via @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "below we show how the forces ( [ forces ] ) , determining the velocity of the drifting spiral wave subject to a variety of perturbations , can be calculated using the computed response functions @xmath64",
    ". we also compare the quantitative analytical prediction of drift velocities with the results of direct simulations .",
    "let us consider a spiral wave drifting due to the perturbation @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant vector . in the co - rotating frame the perturbation ( [ hres ] ) will be @xmath67    substitution of ( [ hres_2 ] ) into ( [ alphan ] ) gives @xmath68 and , by ( [ forces ] ) , @xmath69 hence the _ speed _ of the resonant drift of the spiral is @xmath70 whereas its _ direction _ is constant and arbitrary , @xmath71 as it is determined by the inial phase of the spiral @xmath8 , or , rather , by the phase difference between the spiral and the perturbation , ( [ res - direction ] ) is only valid in the asymptotic sense , and a more accurate formulation is @xmath72 hence , at finite @xmath31 the resonance is expected to be imprecise , and a typical trajectory of a resonantly drifting spiral is a circle of radius @xmath73 .",
    "here we consider an anisotropic perturbation which breaks rotational symmetry @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a constant matrix .",
    "this perturbation corresponds to action of an external electric field on a chemical reaction where some of the species are electrically charged . in this case matrix @xmath76",
    "is diagonal and its nonzero elements represent motilities of the ions of the reaction species .",
    "the same sort of perturbation appears in the asymptotic dynamics of scroll waves  @xcite , where @xmath77 .    in the co - rotating system of reference",
    ", the perturbation ( [ helec ] ) can be written using the goldstone modes ( [ goldstone ] ) , as @xmath78 which , by substituting into ( [ alphan ] ) , gives @xmath79 thus , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , which following ( [ ptb ] ) and ( [ forces ] ) gives the velocity of the electrophoretic drift @xmath82 which remains constant in time .",
    "we now consider the case when the reaction kinetics @xmath83 in ( [ rds ] ) depend on a parameter @xmath84 , and the value of this parameter varies slightly in space , @xmath85 substitution of ( [ inhom ] ) into ( [ rds ] ) gives , to the first order in @xmath31 , @xmath86 with the perturbation in the laboratory frame of reference @xmath87    substitution of ( [ hinhom ] ) into ( [ alphan ] ) gives @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the parameter perturbation considered in the co - moving frame of reference . the final equations for the drift velocities can then be written in the form @xmath91 where for brevity we introduce @xmath92^+{{\\partial}_{{p}}{{\\mathbf{f}}}}(\\rho,\\theta;{p}_0 ) .\\ ] ]      let @xmath93 vary linearly in a sufficiently large region containing the spiral tip and its subsequent drift trajectory .",
    "specifically we consider @xmath94 , where the @xmath95-coordinate of the trajectory remains near @xmath96 . in the co - moving reference frame",
    ", the linear gradient perturbation will be @xmath97 substituting ( [ hlinear ] ) into ( [ kn_inh ] ) gives @xmath98 then , by ( [ alpha_inh ] ) , ( [ ptb ] ) and ( [ forces ] ) , the velocity of the drift due to gradient of a model parameter will be @xmath99    an important feature of equations ( [ speed_gradient ] ) is that the first of them depends on @xmath100 while the second does not .",
    "the dependence on @xmath100 means that the drift velocity changes during the drift , unless the drift proceeds precisely along the @xmath101-axis .",
    "as it happens , at first order in @xmath31 , only the temporal drift , that is the correction to the frequency , shows this dependence .",
    "namely , the first of equations ( [ speed_gradient ] ) shows that the instant rotation frequency corresponds to the parameter value at the current centre of rotation , @xmath102 .",
    "the spatial drift , described by the second of equations ( [ speed_gradient ] ) , does not depend on @xmath100 .",
    "that means that while the drift proceeds , its speed and direction remain the same , at least at the asymptotic order considered .",
    "this is an important observation , firstly , because it allows us to treat linear gradient induced drift in the same way as the electrophoretic drift , expecting drift along a straight line , and secondly , that unlike electrophoretic drift , the assumption is inherently limited to such @xmath100 that @xmath103 remains sufficiently small .      here",
    "we consider a step perturbation located at @xmath104 , @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the heaviside unit step function . in the co - moving frame of reference",
    "we have @xmath107 substitution of ( [ hstep_1 ] ) into ( [ kn_inh ] ) gives @xmath108    we consider three intervals for @xmath109 .    1 .   @xmath110 .",

    "we now consider an inhomogeneity which is unity within a disc of radius @xmath126 centered at @xmath127 , and which is zero outside the disc .",
    "thus we have @xmath128 then calculations , similar to those for a stepwise inhomogeneity , lead to @xmath129 @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 designate the distance and the direction from the current centre of the spiral to the centre of the inhomogeneity ,  @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "this leads to the equations for the drift velocities in the form    @xmath135    it is straightforward to verify that if @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , that is when the disk is so large it turns into a half - plane at @xmath139 , then expressions ( [ disk - k0 ] ) and ( [ disk - k1 ] ) tend to expressions ( [ step - k0 ] ) and ( [ step - k1 ] ) respectively , as should be expected .",

    "as expected , differences appears for larger @xmath31 with the disagreement occurring sooner ( for smaller values of drift speed ) for the linear gradient inhomogeneity drift .",
    "this is related to an extra factor specific to the inhomogeneity - induced drift : the properties of the medium where they matter ,  around the core of the spiral , changes as the spiral drifts .",
    "since we require a certain number of full rotations of the spiral for fitting , faster drift meant longer displacement along the @xmath95 axis and more significant change of the spiral properties along that way , which in turn affects the accuracy of the fitting .",

    "because now the medium is inhomogeneous in the presence of the perturbation , the velocity depends on the instant position of the spiral center and as a result the spiral trajectories can be quite complex .",
    "qualitative comparisons between theory and simulations can be made in the general case , but for detailed quantitative comparison we focus on the cases where the theory predicts simple attractors ,  a straightforward drift along the step for the stepwise inhomogeneity .",

    "the centre of spiral wave rotation may either be attracted to one side of the step where it gradually `` freezes '' , or it may get attached to the step and drift along it with the constant velocity . in the latter case , the speed of the drift is proportional to the inhomogeneity strength , whereas the distance at which the attachment happens , does not not depend on the inhomogeneity strength at leading order . if the sign of inhomogeneity is inverted , the attachment occurs on the opposite side of the step and proceeds in the opposite direction .    in disk - shape inhomogeneity ,",

    "overall , based on results considered , orbital motion around a localized inhomogeneity seems to be more prevalent than attachment to a stepwise inhomogeneity .",
    "moreover , the typical situation seems to be that there are multiple stationary orbits around a disk inhomogeneity .",
    "we have already discussed this situation in our recent preliminary short communication  @xcite where we have also illustrated how for the initial conditions between two stationary orbits , the spiral wave launched into one orbit or the other depending on the sign of the inhomogeneity .    the possibility of orbital drift , related to a change of sign of an equivalent to the function @xmath255 , has been discussed at a speculative level in  @xcite .",
    "the sign change of translational response functions was observed in oscillatory media described by cgle  @xcite .",
    "the examples we consider here suggest that this theoretical possibility is in fact quite often realized in excitable media , and even multiple orbits are quite typical .",

    "so , the version of kinematic theory of spiral waves suggested in  @xcite produces an equivalent of response functions , which is not only quickly decaying , but also periodically changing sign at large radii , with an asymptotic period equal to the quarter of the asymptotic wavelength of the spiral wave . other variants of the kinematic theory ,  @xcite did not , to our knowledge , reveal any such features on a theoretical level . however , numerical simulations of kinematic equations presented in  @xcite showed attachment of spiral waves to non - flux boundaries , which in a sense is similar to attachment to stepwise inhomogeneity . on a phenomenogical level ,",
    "such attachment is , of course well known since the earliest simulations of excitable media ,  @xcite .    [",

    "in particular , depending on the detail of the feedback , this planar system may have limit cycle attractors , dubbed `` resonant attractors '' in  @xcite , which may have circular shape if the system with the feedback has an axial symmetry . apart from this being a completely different type of drift",
    ", we also comment that the second order ode system is an approximation subject to the assumption that the feedback is instant , and in the situations when the delay in the feedback is significant due to the system size and large distance between spiral core and feedback electrode , the behaviour becomes more complicated .    for some combination of parameters , the trajectory of an orbiting spiral may also resemble meandering and may be taken for this in simulations or experiments .",
    "so , it is possible that orbital movement was actually observed by zou  @xcite where they reported spiral `` meandering '' around a `` partially excitable defect '' ; although it is difficult to be certain as no details are given .",
    "the difference is that spiral meandering , in the proper sense , is due to internal instabilities of a spiral wave , whereas orbital motion is due to inhomogeneity .",
    "e.g. in orbiting , the `` meandering pattern '' determined by @xmath272 will change depending on the inhomogeneity strength .",
    "the phenomenon of `` pinning '' of spiral waves to localized inhomogeneities has important practical implications for the problem of low voltage defibrillation  @xcite . in terms of spiral wave dynamics",
    "this is usually understood as attraction of the spiral centre towards the inhomogeneity locus .",
    "practically interesting cases of pinning are usually associated with inexcitable obstacles , which are not small perturbations and therefore not amenable to the asymptotic theory considered in this study .",
    "however , the possibility of orbital motion around a weak inhomogeneity suggests that a similar phenomenon may be observed in strong inhomogeneities as well .",
    "this offers an unexpected aspect on the problem of pinning .",
    "instead of a simplistic  binary \" viewpoint , that a local inhomogeneity can either be attractive , which is the case of pinning , or repelling , which is the case of unpinning , there is actually a third possibility , which can in fact be more prevalent than the first two , namely , that at some initial conditions the spiral may orbit around one of a number of circular orbits , regardless of whether or not it is attracted to the center , which can be considered just as one of the orbits that happens to have radius zero .",

    "the key objects of the asymptotic theory are the response functions ,  the critical eigenfunctions of the adjoint linearized operator .",
    "the rfs have been found to be localized in most models where they have been calculated ; however there are counterexamples demonstrating that surprises are possible  @xcite .",
    "physical intuition tells that for the response function to be localized , the spiral wave should be indifferent to distant perturbations , which will be the case if the core of the spiral is a `` source '' rather than a `` sink '' in the sense of the flow of causality , for example as defined by the group velocity .",
    "indeed , this localization property has been proven for one - dimensional analogues of spiral waves  @xcite and there is hope that this result can be extended to spiral and scroll waves .",
    "the effective spatial localization of the rfs on the mathematical level guarantees convergence of the integrals involved in asymptotic theory , and on the physical level explains why wave - like objects like spiral and scroll waves , while stretching to infinity and synchronizing the whole medium , behave respectively as particle - like and string - like localized objects .",
    "this macroscopic dissipative wave - particle duality of the spiral waves has been previously demonstrated for the complex ginzburg - landau equation @xcite which is the archetypical oscillatory media model .",
