    "the interaction between electrons may give rise to three different types of order parameters describing superconductivity , magnetism or a modulation of the charge density .",
    "as an example let us consider the heisenberg interaction , @xmath1 the sum in eq.([hh ] ) runs over nearest neighbor sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the vector of pauli matrices , and @xmath5 are creation and annihilation operators for electrons at site @xmath2 with spin projection @xmath6 . in a mean - field treatment the expectation value of the two creation ( or annihilation ) operators , i.e. , the order parameter , may be non - zero which leads to singlet superconductivity with extended s - wave or d - wave symmetry or triplet superconductivity with p - wave symmetry . if the average of two operators from the same site is non - zero we have a modulation of finite local spin moments describing a magnetic state . if the expectation value of two operators with the same spin projection is non - zero we deal with a charge - density wave ( cdw ) with an internal symmetry , because the two operators in the order parameter belong to different sites .",
    "this case will be considered in the following .",
    "for a square lattice with 4 nearest neighbors there are four different local order parameters associated with each of the four bonds which are in general complex valued but also subject to the condition that the resulting mean - field hamiltonian must be hermitian .",
    "the imaginary parts correspond to circulating currents expressing the breaking of time reversal symmetry .",
    "@xcite the order parameters of a cdw may be classified by the point group symmetry and have in our case extended s - wave , d - wave or p - wave symmetries .",
    "moreover , they show a modulation throughout the crystal with a wave vector @xmath7 corresponding to the total momentum of electron - hole pairs .",
    "cdw systems with an internal structure are called unconventional charge - density waves@xcite to distinguish them from conventional ones where the electron and hole sit at the same site and do not exhibit any internal structure .",
    "unconventional charge - density wave systems have been invoked to explain experimental features in organic conductors , @xcite 2d transition metal dichalcogenides@xcite and high - t@xmath8 superconductors .",
    "@xcite in particular , it has been shown that a charge density wave with d - wave symmetry ( d - cdw or , shortly , ddw ) competes with d - wave superconductivity in the @xmath9 model in the large-@xmath10 limit where @xmath10 is the number of spin projections.@xcite the phase diagram of this model has a quantum critical point ( qcp ) separating at @xmath11 the normal phase at large doping from a d - cdw state at lower doping if superconductivity is disregarded . allowing also for superconductivity the qcp separates a pure superconducting state from a ground state where superconductivity and a d - cdw coexist .",
    "due to the presence of the d - cdw the transition temperature for superconductivity exhibits a maximum , to be identified with optimal doping , and then decreases strongly in the underdoped regime .",
    "the d - cdw state exists above t@xmath8 near optimal and the underdoped region which means that the pseudogap phase should be identified with the d - cdw in this model .",
    "various observable quantities have been calculated within this picture and compared with experimental data but no final conclusions have been reached .    in the following we will study the optical conductivity of a d - cdw system .",
    "in contrast to other recent work@xcite vertex corrections will be taken into account within a conserving approximation scheme.@xcite otherwise a proper definition of the current already poses a problem . within a mean - field theory",
    "the current can be defined via the continuity equation for the charge density .",
    "the explicit calculation of the time derivative of the charge density using the mean - field hamiltonian of a d - cdw yields the following expression for the longitudinal current in @xmath12 space , @xcite @xmath13 . \\label{j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath14 and @xmath15 are one - particle energies and the d - wave order parameter , respectively . the first term in eq.([j ] )",
    "is the standard expression for the current , the second one is unconventional and due to the momentum dependence of the order parameter . the use of the current definition eq.([j ] ) in calculating the optical conductivity guarantees that the continuity equation is satisfied@xcite but it is not apriori clear whether it is at finite frequencies more correct than the usual procedure based only on the first term in eq.([j ] ) . in particular",
    ", one can argue that the exact interaction term in the hamiltonian should be used in defining the current .",
    "one would then obtain only the first term in eq.([j ] ) because the interaction , for instance , a heisenberg term , commutes with the density operator .",
    "below we will show that a correct treatment defines the current only via the first term in eq.([j ] ) but takes vertex corrections ( vc ) into account . in this way",
    "the effective current at low - frequency is of the form of eq.([j ] ) and satisfies the continuity equation whereas it resembles more a bare current at high frequencies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we introduce some properties of the hamiltonian of a d - cdw system . in section",
    "iii we derive and solve the equation for the current vertex . in section iv the optical conductivity is calculated and several limiting cases such as high and low frequencies are considered as well as the weight of the drude peak , optical transitions and the optical sum rule .",

    "it is a consequence of the continuity equation for charge and current densities .",
    "since the self - energy matrix is always non - zero in the ddw state it means that the current vertex is always renormalized and never equal to the bare one .",

    "this increase is due to the renormalization of the one - particle energies .",

    "on the other hand , the use of a current derived from the continuity equation as in eq.([j ] ) would yield the dashed curve in fig.[fig : drude ] and would thus overestimate @xmath187 at large frequencies .",

    "thus the enhancement of @xmath234 and its stronger temperature dependence by vc should be related to the low - frequency part of @xmath187 , i.e. , to @xmath182 , which is in agreement with the dashed and dotted curves in fig.[fig : weights ] .",

    "the solid line in fig.[fig : temp ] , calculated with @xmath241 , illustrates that this indeed is the case .",
    "most of the spectral weight resides now in a very broad and extended high - frequency structure above @xmath242 , only a small part of @xmath234 is left for the drude peak . with increasing temperature the length of the fermi lines increases and the spectral weight is shifted from the optical region to the drude peak , as shown by the dashed and dot - dashed lines in this figure .    in conclusion",
    ", we have calculated the optical conductivity @xmath187 of a two - dimensional d - cdw conductor taking into account vertex corrections .",
    "the employed formulation can easily be generalized to an arbitrary symmetry of the cdw state and to a general band structure .",
    "we have addressed and solved the problem of a proper definition of the current to be used in calculating @xmath187 . defining the current via the continuity equation both the renormalization of the one - particle energies due to the interaction causing the cdw as well as an additional term due to the momentum dependence of the cdw order parameter enter .",
    "using this renormalized current and bare vertices yields a @xmath187 which is shown to be correct only in the limit @xmath243 . on the other hand , using bare vertices and the bare electron dispersion violates in general the continuity equation for the charge density and gives a @xmath187 which is correct only at large frequencies . the proposed solution is to use bare current vertices but to include vertex and the corresponding self - energy corrections . in this way",
    "the continuity equation is explicitly fulfilled and the frequency dependence of the vertex interpolates smoothly from the strongly renormalized regime at low to the unrenormalized regime at high frequencies .",
    "this behavior is also visible in the numerically calculated conductivity curves .",
    "these calculations show the spectral features of the drude - like peak at low and the transitions across the gap at high frequencies and their dependence on temperature and the next - nearest neighbor hopping constant @xmath0 .",
    "remarkable is also that the temperature dependence of the restricted optical sum @xmath234 ( i.e. , the spectral weight integrated over all frequencies ) between @xmath11 and @xmath244 is enhanced by vertex corrections .",
    "this may be interpreted as a violation of the sum rule by about 10 per cents in that interval .",
    "this as well as the other above predictions may help to identify experimentally unconventional cdw s ."
