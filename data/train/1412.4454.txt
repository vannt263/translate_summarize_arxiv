    "the discovery of cosmic acceleration @xcite has inspired numerous theoretical explanations for its existence .",
    "on one hand , the acceleration can be caused by a new , unknown force that exhibits negative pressure called _ dark energy _",
    "the cosmological constant , a special case of dark energy , is a major component of the @xmath9cdm framework that explains the expansion history and the growth history of the universe @xcite and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible that the dynamics of gravity deviate from general relativity ( gr ) on cosmological scales @xcite , a concept called _ modified gravity_. in observations of the universe s expansion history , these two effects are degenerate with one another .",
    "however , we expect the growth of structure to differ between dark energy and modified gravity models such that the degeneracy is broken .    an observable that probes the expansion history and growth of structure simultaneously is @xmath1 @xcite , which is related to the ratio of the laplacian of the difference between the two scalar potentials @xmath10 to the peculiar velocity perturbation field @xmath11 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 depends on how gravity behaves on large scales .",
    "traditionally , when measuring @xmath1 , @xmath10 is probed by a galaxy lensing correlation with a tracer of large - scale structure ( lss ) , while the peculiar velocity field is probed by either a galaxy - velocity cross - correlation or , equivalently , a galaxy autocorrelation times the redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) parameter @xmath12 , where @xmath3 is the growth rate and @xmath13 is the clustering bias of the galaxies .",
    "a major advantage of @xmath1 over other observables is that it is independent of clustering bias on linear scales , reducing the model uncertainty .",
    "@xmath1 was first measured in @xcite , using galaxy - galaxy lensing exhibited by sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) @xcite to find @xmath14 , consistent with @xmath9cdm .    in this analysis",
    "we assess the possibility of using cmb lensing cross correlated with galaxies as a probe of @xmath10 instead of the traditional method of using galaxy lensing .",
    "one advantage of using cmb lensing over galaxy lensing is that the cmb lensing kernel is very broad over redshift , allowing probes of @xmath1 at much higher redshifts than with galaxy lensing . at these higher redshifts",
    ", cmb lensing also has the added bonus of probing more linear scales , reducing systematic effects due to nonlinear clustering . also , since the cmb propagates throughout all of space , all of lss sampled by the survey lenses the cmb , allowing us to measure the lensing part of @xmath1 at much higher redshifts .",
    "we also do not have to worry about complex astrophysical uncertainties of the source galaxies , _ i.e. _ intrinsic alignments , since the cmb is simple .",
    "finally , we know the cmb redshift , so we can avoid determining the photometric redshift distribution of the sources .",
    "we construct an estimator for @xmath1 in terms of the angular cross - power spectrum between the cmb lensing convergence @xmath0 and galaxies , the angular auto - power spectrum of the same galaxies , and the rsd parameter @xmath4 .",
    "next , we derive @xmath1 for general relativity ( gr ) , as well as modified gravity using the @xmath15 formalism from @xcite .",
    "while @xmath16 can be written as @xmath17 for @xmath9cdm , where @xmath18 is the matter density today relative to the critical density and @xmath19 is the growth rate at redshift @xmath20 , @xmath1 for modified gravity models is expected to differ from this value .",
    "we also found that @xmath1 for @xmath2 gravity @xcite and chameleon gravity @xcite can exhibit scale - dependence through @xmath3 , which could potentially help differentiate between these gravity models and gr .",
    "next , we consider the prospect of measuring @xmath1 with cmb lensing by forecasting errors for an @xmath1 measurement using the current _ planck _ cmb lensing map along with the cmass galaxy ( @xmath21 ) , lowz galaxy ( @xmath22 ) , and boss quasar spectroscopic samples from data release 11 ( dr11 ) @xcite of the sdss - iii @xcite baryon oscillations spectroscopic survey ( boss ) @xcite",

    "planck _ lensing map cross - correlated with spectroscopic surveys , specifically the dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ) @xcite , _ euclid _ @xcite , and the wide field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) @xcite .",
    "we find , however , that an @xmath1 measurement using the _ planck _ cmb lensing map and upcoming spectroscopic surveys is not sensitive enough to differentiate between gr and @xmath2 gravity at current limits , and that the new limits on chameleon gravity would be modest .",
    "we find that spectroscopic surveys with advanced actpol can differentiate between gr and @xmath2 gravity at the level of @xmath6 , with higher significances for the chameleon gravity model .",
    "we also consider the cmb lensing maps cross - correlated with photometric surveys , specifically the dark energy survey ( des ) @xcite , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) @xcite , and _",
    "euclid_. we find that for the scales which @xmath1 dominates , being small but still only quasi - linear , the lensing measurement dominates the error in @xmath1 as opposed to the rsd .",
    "thus , reducing the shot noise by increasing the survey number density is more important than having more precise redshifts for rsd .",
    "we find des is comparable in power to desi , and lsst and photometric _ euclid _ can discriminate between gr and @xmath2 gravity at very high significance using lensing from adv .",
    "however , this will require an rsd precision on the order of 10% , which is difficult but possible for _ euclid _ and lsst .",
    "photometric surveys combined with cmb lensing experiments can produce significant constraints to @xmath1 that could help uncover the true nature of gravity .",

    "this approximation works well when the galaxy redshift distribution is highly peaked , which is especially true when we use small redshift bins in forecasts for upcoming surveys . also , we assume from linear theory @xmath46 . in that case , eq .",

    "the error is mainly dominated by the cmb lensing , which is a measure independent of @xmath4 and @xmath74 .",

    "a precise measurement of @xmath1 will be slightly biased from the true value due to several reasons similar to those outlined in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "for one , galaxy redshift distributions can exhibit a spread and skewness , causing the approximation in eq .",
    "[ e : clapprox ] to break down .",
    "however , we can characterize this deviation analytically as a function of angular scale .",
    "also , in order to extend our measurement of @xmath1 to small scales , we must correct for the scale - dependence of the bias due to clustering at nonlinear scales .",
    "we may also need to consider scale - dependent @xmath4 due to nonlinear density and velocity perturbations , although velocity perturbations tend to stay linear at smaller scales than for density perturbations .",
    "in addition , constraints on modified gravity parameters will have to account for the scale dependence of @xmath4 due to the growth rate .",
