    "the scope of this paper is neutrino astronomy for @xmath5  mev .",
    "our main interest is neutrinos from energetic astrophysical sources such as binary stars and accreting black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "we will also discuss atmospheric neutrinos at some length because they are the only neutrinos with @xmath6  mev that have yet been detected .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are both background and calibration beam for high energy neutrino astronomy .",
    "they are of interest in their own right because they probe an uncharted range of neutrino oscillation parameter space . for stellar collapse neutrinos and solar neutrinos",

    "_  @xcite and turck - chieze _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .    in his classic review of cosmic ray showers in 1960 @xcite , greisen ends with a discussion of the prospects for gamma ray and neutrino astronomy at very high energy .",
    "he notes that `` since photons and neutrinos propagate in straight lines , success in their detection will open up broad new areas of astronomy . ''",
    "he discussed the relation between photons and neutrinos from decay of pions produced in the interstellar medium or near a source .",
    "he described a detector very much like the present water cherenkov detectors ( complete with veto shield against entering muons ) , and he estimated the rate of interactions of atmospheric neutrinos in 3 kilotons of sensitive volume to be 500 events per year .",
    "the idea of detecting neutrinos by looking for neutrino - induced upward or horizontal muons was suggested by markov & zheleznykh @xcite at about the same time .",
    "the process is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a nucleon in the material surrounding the detector . the muon range increases with energy .",
    "this extends the effective target volume and makes it possible to see neutrino - induced muons with detectors of moderate size .",
    "two groups ( kolar gold fields @xcite and case - wittwatersrand @xcite ) reported the first observations of atmospheric neutrinos with the detection of horizontal muons in detectors so deep that the muons could not have been produced in the atmosphere .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are of current interest , despite their long history and apparently mundane origin , because of the anomalous flavor ratio observed for neutrino interactions in the large proton decay detectors , kamiokande @xcite and imb @xcite .",
    "the essential point is that , because of their large volume , these detectors can measure interactions of neutrinos inside the detector .",
    "they need not depend on the large external target mass provided by the long range of energetic muons produced in charged current interactions of muon - type neutrinos .",
    "they can therefore study both @xmath9 and @xmath10 interactions . in all , more than a thousand atmospheric neutrino events have now been measured by the various underground experiments@xcite the anomaly is that the observed ratio of events produced by electron neutrinos to those from muon neutrinos is significantly larger than expected .    several new detectors designed specifically for high energy neutrino astronomy are about to come into operation .",
    "the baikal experiment @xcite has already reported some muon measurements @xcite .",
    "the dumand @xcite and amanda @xcite are being partially deployed at present , and other detectors , such as nestor @xcite are in advanced prototype stages .",
    "a major stimulus for this activity is the prospect that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may be prolific particle accelerators and beam dumps , and therefore intense sources of high energy neutrinos .",
    "we have divided our review into three major sections : ( _ a _ ) atmospheric neutrinos , ( _ b _ ) possible sources of high energy neutrinos of extraterrestrial origin and ( _ c _ ) neutrino detection .",
    "we include some comments about high energy gamma ray astronomy relevant to possible neutrino sources at the beginning of part  ( _ b _ ) .",
    "we begin with a brief treatment of neutrino production in cosmic ray cascades , which is relevant both for atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "unlike the typical monoenergetic beam produced by a machine , cosmic accelerators produce power law spectra of ions at high energy , @xmath11 the observed high energy cosmic ray spectrum at earth is characterized by @xmath12 . in general , a cosmic accelerator in which the dominant mechanism is first order diffusive shock acceleration ( first order fermi mechanism ) , will produce a spectrum with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a small number .",
    "the observed spectrum is thought to be steeper than the accelerated spectrum because of the energy dependence of the cosmic ray diffusion in the galaxy . the simplest way to understand",
    "this is to think of the observer as inside a volume of `` containment '' from which the characteristic escape time decreases with energy @xmath15 if @xmath16 is the rate of production of cosmic rays per unit volume , then the observed cosmic ray density will be @xmath17 for @xmath18  gev , a value of @xmath19 can be inferred from observed ratios of secondary cosmic ray nuclei ( e.g. li , be , b ) to their progenitors ( e.g. carbon and oxygen ) @xcite .",
    "production of secondary particles ( @xmath20 ) is related to the spectrum of accelerated primaries ( @xmath21 ) by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the probability of interaction in traversing a small amount ( @xmath24 ) of target .",
    "if the distribution of secondaries depends only on the ratio of energies , @xmath25 , then the integral in eq .",
    "( [ dp / de ] ) becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27 for @xmath28 does not contribute to the integral , and the scaling approximation made here is an adequate approximation for rough estimates .",
    "this treatment generalizes readily to decay chains , such as @xmath29 , etc . , and it can be applied to cascades in galactic and stellar environments as well as in the earth s atmosphere . in case of a thick target",
    "in which the primary beam is fully attenuated , the production spectrum of secondaries is given by eq .",
    "( [ dp / de ] ) with the replacement @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the attenuation length of the primary .    in general ,",
    "the flux of neutrinos from decay of pions is given by  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a constant that depends on nucleon and pion attenuation lengths .",
    "the first term inside the curly brackets represents neutrinos from decay of pions .",
    "the energy @xmath36 is a characteristic energy that reflects the competition between decay and interaction in the medium . for cascade development in the earth s atmosphere @xmath37  gev ; it is larger for more tenuous media , such as the atmosphere of the sun .",
    "the @xmath38 represents the contributions of other mesons , with @xmath39  gev and @xmath40  gev in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "each term also contains the appropriate branching ratio , e.g.  0.635 for @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , all parent mesons decay , and",
    "the neutrino spectrum is parallel to the primary nucleon flux . for @xmath43",
    "the neutrino spectrum steepens by one power of @xmath44 . in the atmosphere ,",
    "muons with @xmath45  gev reach the surface and stop before they decay .    in the energy range important for contained events ( @xmath46  gev )",
    "decay in flight of atmospheric muons is the dominant source of @xmath9 , and an important source of @xmath10 . at much higher energy ,",
    "the dominant source of atmospheric @xmath9 is    @xmath47    the relative contributions of the various decay modes to lepton spectra in the earth s atmosphere are discussed in detail by lipari  @xcite .",
    "if we consider neutrino production in astrophysical settings , with typical matter densities of 10@xmath48  atoms/@xmath49 , pions and kaons will always decay and the neutrino spectrum will follow the nucleon spectrum also at very high energy .",
    "in addition , muon decay will continue to be an important source of neutrinos at high energy as well as low .",
    "thus we can define three types of neutrino spectra that can be produced by cosmic rays :    1 .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos , which follow the incident cosmic ray spectrum with @xmath50 up to @xmath51100  gev and steepen toward @xmath52 at higher energy .",
    "the position of the bend increases with increasing zenith angle , which generates a characteristic angular dependence of the atmospheric neutrino spectrum described by the angular factor in eq .",
    "( [ dn / de ] ) .",
    "electron neutrinos , that come mostly from muon decays have a spectrum with one power of @xmath53 steeper .",
    "2 .   neutrinos produced by galactic cosmic rays in interactions with interstellar gas .",
    "these extraterrestrial neutrinos should follow the cosmic ray spectrum up to the highest energies , since all interaction products , including muons , decay .",
    "neutrinos produced by cosmic rays _ at their acceleration sites _ and following the hard ( @xmath542.2 ) cosmic ray source spectra , which are not yet affected by the energy - dependent escape from the galaxy .",
    "these three types of neutrino fluxes are illustrated schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos have been detected and studied extensively .",
    "diffuse galactic neutrinos should exist with intensities comparable to the diffuse galactic gamma ray background  @xcite .",
    "they should be detected by a future generation of detectors of sufficient size to see neutrinos at a rate of several per 10@xmath55  m@xmath56 per year  @xcite .",
    "these two fluxes can be used for calibration of high energy neutrino telescopes , which have as their principal goal the search for high energy neutrinos from energetic astrophysical systems .",
    "the existence of neutrinos associated with cosmic ray sources is more problematic .",
    "it requires substantial acceleration in compact sources with sufficient local gas to act as a beam dump .",
    "the _ possibility _",
    "( not certainty ) of such point sources is suggested by the fact that the standard model of cosmic ray acceleration by supernova blast waves in the diffuse interstellar medium can not accelerate particles to the highest observed energies .",
    "an alternative for the higher energy cosmic radiation is acceleration in compact sources .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "first order fermi acceleration at supernova blast shocks offers a very attractive model for a galactic acceleration mechanism , providing about the right power and spectral shape .",
    "shock acceleration takes time , however , because the energy gain occurs gradually as a particle diffuses back and forth across the shock front .",
    "the finite lifetime of the shock thus limits the maximum energy per particle that can be achieved at a particular supernova .",
    "the acceleration rate is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the shock velocity , @xmath59 the charge of the particle being accelerated and @xmath60 the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the numerical constant @xmath61 depends on the details of diffusion in the vicinity of the shock . the crucial length scale in eq .",
    "( [ emax ] ) is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63  yrs for the free expansion phase of a supernova .",
    "using this kind of argument , lagage &  cesarsky  @xcite show that , in its simplest version ( shock velocity parallel to magnetic field direction , @xmath64gauss ) @xmath65 can only reach energies @xmath66ev@xmath67 for an accelerated nucleus . that leaves a large gap of some three orders of magnitude that can not be explained by the `` standard model '' of cosmic ray origin . to reach",
    "a higher energy one has to increase significantly @xmath60 and/or @xmath68 .",
    "one possibility is to use the much higher magnetic fields associated with some energetic astrophysical systems .",
    "there is no shortage of such objects in the galaxy , the most obvious being neutron stars and black holes , as well as young supernova remnants .",
    "some examples of possible acceleration sites will be discussed in section  6 below .",
    "any such compact region with active particle acceleration would be a likely site for production of high energy neutrinos and photons through interactions of the accelerated particles with the ambient gas and radiation fields .",
    "we emphasize that this is not the only possibility .",
    "some argue @xcite that explaining the higher energy cosmic rays by a new source is unnatural because it requires fine tuning to produce a smooth spectrum where cosmic rays from the second source join onto those from the first .",
    "there are several ways to extend the basic supernova mechanism to higher energies .",
    "one possibility @xcite takes advantage of the fact that some supernovas explode into the stellar wind of a progenitor star rather than the interstellar medium .",
    "if the progenitor wind carries a high enough magnetic field , then higher top energies can be achieved ( see eq .  [ emax ] ) .",
    "other possibilities involve a configuration in which the magnetic field is quasi - perpendicular to the shock normal @xcite or the interaction of high energy cosmic rays with expanding shocks of several supernovas in an active region @xcite .",
    "mechanisms such as these would not be correlated with point sources of high energy gamma rays and neutrinos .",
    "perhaps the most exciting possibility at present is the suggestion @xcite that particle acceleration plays a central role inside agn and that interactions of these high energy particles with dense photon fields and gas in the central regions of agn @xcite will lead to production of neutrinos of very high energies .",
    "this possibility is the subject of  6 .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the window of opportunity for high energy neutrino astronomy .",
    "the steepening at high energy of the spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos , which dominate the total neutrino flux at low energy , allows the possibility of reasonable signal / background ratios , shown schematically by the shaded area on fig .  1 .",
    "the small angle between the parent neutrino and the secondary lepton in charged current interactions at high energy allows for accurate source location and enhanced signal / background ratio in the case of point sources .",
    "the exact position of the crossover from atmospheric to astrophysical neutrinos , depends on luminosity , distribution and distances of potential sources and on energy response and , in the case of point sources , angular resolution of the detectors .",
    "these will be discussed for a number of sources in sections  68 below .",
    "the atmospheric cascade that produces the cosmic ray neutrino beam is depicted in eq .",
    "( [ cascades ] ) : @xmath69 protons also produce negative mesons and neutrons produce positive mesons , but the same charge processes are slightly favored by the steep spectra and the excess of same - charge mesons in the forward fragmentation region .",
    "although analytic expressions like eq .  ( [ dn / de ] ) are qualitatively correct , more detailed calculations are needed for a precise evaluation of the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "several complications must be accounted for :    * the primary cosmic ray spectrum is not a simple power law , especially @xmath70  gev and @xmath71  tev .",
    "moreover , it depends on location and direction ( because of the geomagnetic cutoff ) and on the epoch of the solar cycle . *",
    "muon energy loss , decay and polarization must be accounted for .",
    "* the inclusive cross sections do not have exactly scale - invariant forms .",
    "furthermore , nuclei , as well as nucleons , are involved in the collisions .",
    "contained events are those neutrino interactions that originate within the detector s fiducial volume and whose interaction products are all contained within that volume .",
    "most such events have lepton energies in the gev range or less . in this case , most muons decay , and all the complications listed above come into play .",
    "qualitative expectations for the neutrino ratios follow from simple kinematics of the @xmath72 decay chain . because of the asymmetry of the @xmath73 decay mode , each of the two neutrinos from muon decay has about the same energy as the neutrino from pion decay . thus in a given energy range @xmath74 the excess of @xmath9 to @xmath75",
    "is a consequence of the excess of protons to neutrons in the incident cosmic ray beam .",
    "several detailed calculations @xcite of the @xmath51gev neutrino fluxes agree with each other in finding a value for the neutrino flavor ratio within 5% of each other .",
    "attention is focussed on the flavor ratio because most of the sources of uncertainty in the calculation of neutrino fluxes cancel in calculating the ratio .",
    "( these uncertainties include normalization of primary spectrum , treatment of geomagnetic effects and parameterization of pion production in collisions of cosmic ray protons and helium with nuclei of the atmosphere . ) specifically , the neutrino flux calculations give    @xmath76    for @xmath77  gev @xcite . the fact that this expectation is apparently significantly violated  @xcite is largely responsible for the great interest in atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the water cherenkov detectors @xcite in fact see as many @xcite or more @xcite electrons than muons .",
    "part of the difference between expectation and observation is a consequence of the fact that the acceptance of the detectors spans a larger energy range for electrons than for muons . even after accounting for flavor - dependence of the acceptance , however , a significant discrepancy remains .",
    "detailed simulations of the detector response , including acceptance effects , lead to the result that the ratio of ratios for charged leptons from interactions of @xmath78 and @xmath79 is @xmath80 for kamiokande with 6.2 kt - yrs of data ( 389 contained , single - ring events ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding imb result is    @xmath81    for 7.7",
    "kt - yrs of data ( 507 contained , single - ring events @xcite ) .",
    "the water detectors thus show at least a @xmath82 discrepancy between observation and expectation for the @xmath83 ratio .",
    "measurements with tracking calorimeters give mixed results , and the statistical uncertainties are significantly larger than for the water detectors .",
    "nusex ( 0.74 kt - yrs , @xcite ) and frejus ( 1.56 kt - yrs , @xcite ) are both consistent with expectation .",
    "in contrast , soudan 2 ( 1.0 kt - yrs , @xcite ) finds a ratio of ratios similar to kamiokande .",
    "the number of events is relatively low in all three experiments , and the systematic effects are also different .    in view of the complexity of the analysis involved , it is of interest to ask to what extent the data from the two water detectors are consistent with each other .",
    "@xcite compared the imb and kamiokande data at stage when kamiokande had 4.92 kt years of data @xcite and imb had 3.4 kt years @xcite .",
    "they found the data to be fully consistent between the two experiments .",
    "table  [ cont_t ] shows a comparison based on the more complete data sets , 7.7 kt years for imb @xcite and 6.2 kt years for kamiokande @xcite .",
    "the comparison is made by converting kamiokande data to imb .",
    "three factors are involved : + 1 ) the larger exposure of imb ( 7.7/6.2 = 1.24 ) .",
    "+ 2 ) higher muon threshold at imb  the muon threshold is 300 mev / c for imb as compared to 200 mev / c for kamiokande . using the momentum spectra of ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate that this reduces the kamiokande muon rate by 0.79 .",
    "+ 3 ) the lower geomagnetic cutoffs at imb . using the cutoff effects from ref .",
    "@xcite , this increases the muon rate by a factor 1.23 and the electron rate by 1.34 . the larger correction factor for electrons is a consequence of the fact that the electron threshold ( 100 mev / c for both experiments ) is lower than the muon threshold , and the geomagnetic filter affects low energies more than high .",
    "+ these three correction factors are applied successively to the kamiokande column to obtain the converted kamiokande numbers that may be compared directly with the imb column .    .",
    "[ cont_t ] comparison of contained event rates . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     both imb @xcite and kamiokande @xcite used low values of the cross section @xcite and the neutrino flux @xcite as central values for comparison with their data . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , with this input the kamiokande data on throughgoing muons rule out a region of parameter space for @xmath84 oscillations for @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this is very similar to the excluded region obtained by the imb group starting from the same assumptions .",
    "when a better representation of the cross section @xcite and a higher neutrino flux @xcite are used , however , the region excluded by upward , throughgoing muons is much smaller . in particular , much of the region `` allowed '' by",
    "the kamiokande contained events @xcite is also allowed by the kamiokande measurement of upward muons . in the further numerical examples below the neutrino cross section and flux used for calculations",
    "correspond to these higher inputs @xcite .",
    "although consistent conclusions seem to emerge from interpretation of the kamiokande and imb data on upward muons , the same can not be said for baksan .",
    "the baksan group still exclude most of the kamiokande `` allowed '' region even when they use the highest neutrino flux calculation @xcite . the baksan limit on @xmath84 oscillations is based on upward events near the vertical , specifically zenith angles in the interval @xmath87 .",
    "they observe 161 upward muons in this angular range during a live time of 7.15 years . with the low neutrino flux",
    "@xcite they expect 142 , as compared to 163 with the high neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "in the comparable angular region the kamiokande measurement is @xmath88 upward muons per ( cm@xmath56  s  sr ) .",
    "the calculated result with high flux is 1.76 and with low flux 1.55 .",
    "the prediction of kamiokande with the high neutrino flux but assuming @xmath84 oscillations is 1.34 ( instead of 1.76 ) , which is completely consistent with the experimental value of @xmath90 .",
    "this is for @xmath91 and @xmath92  ev@xmath56 .",
    "the preliminary result from macro  @xcite is similar to the kamiokande result : they measure @xmath93 events as compared to a calculated number for the same exposure of @xmath94 .    in summary ,",
    "therefore , we conclude that the present data on upward muons _ do not _ rule out a @xmath84 oscillation at a level sufficient to explain the contained event anomaly .",
    "a tenfold increase in statistics would help resolve the situation , particularly if the full zenith angle range can be measured accurately .",
    "for example , with @xmath95  ev@xmath56 the flux would be significantly suppressed near the horizontal as well as for @xmath96 , but for @xmath97  ev@xmath56 the near horizontal flux would not be suppressed .",
    "the imb group points out that the fraction of upward muons that stop in the detector is relatively insensitive to uncertainties in the calculation because the flux normalization cancels .",
    "they find  @xcite that the measured fraction of stopping muons rules out a portion of the ( @xmath98 ) plane for @xmath99  ev@xmath56 and large mixing angle .",
    "the constraint on the @xmath100 parameter from the fraction of stopping muons comes from the absence of a distortion of the muon energy spectrum .",
    "the relevant neutrino energies are illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . for example ,",
    "if @xmath101  ev@xmath56 the transition probability ( [ p_nu ] ) is relatively large for @xmath102  gev ( and @xmath103  km ) but negligible for @xmath104  gev . in this case",
    "one would have a significant distortion of the energy spectrum of upward muons and hence an anomaly in the stopping fraction provided the mixing angle is sufficiently large . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath105 then both the high and low energy portions will be affected similarly and no distortion of the stopping / throughgoing ratio would occur .",
    "it should be mentioned that the imb constraint from the stopping fraction is based on use of a single neutrino flux calculation  @xcite .",
    "it therefore reflects a particular assumption about the slope of the primary cosmic ray spectrum and other factors that could affect the shape of the neutrino spectrum .",
    "one example of such a factor is the uncertainty in the production of kaons , because kaons contribute about 50% of the throughgoing signal but only about 25% of the stopping muons .",
    "nevertheless , as table  [ upp_t ] illustrates , the uncertainty in shape is less than the uncertainty in normalization .",
    "so far in discussing atmospheric neutrinos we have considered only those which come from decay of pions , kaons and muons .",
    "the ( semi)-leptonic decay of charmed particles , produced in the interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere , is also a source of atmospheric muons and neutrinos  the `` prompt '' leptons .",
    "these prompt leptons are also described by eq .",
    "( [ dn / de ] ) , but with a much larger value of @xmath106  tev , which is a consequence of the short lifetime of charmed particles .",
    "charmed particles almost always decay before they interact in the atmosphere .",
    "thus , whereas the spectrum of conventional muons and neutrinos becomes one power of energy steeper than the primary spectrum for @xmath107  tev , the prompt leptons continue with the same power as the primary spectrum to much higher energy .",
    "prompt leptons eventually dominate the atmospheric spectra at energies above 10100  tev as a result of their flatter energy spectrum .",
    "for this reason , an estimate of prompt neutrinos is important for estimating the background for astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "prompt neutrinos and muons have a characteristic isotropic angular distribution , in contrast to the characteristic @xmath108 dependence of the decay products of pions and kaons above @xmath109  tev ( see eq .  [ dn / de ] ) .",
    "searching for an isotropic component of the atmospheric muon spectrum with deep underground detectors is a traditional technique to look for a prompt component and hence to estimate the charm cross section .",
    "underground detectors exploit the depth - intensity relations for muons in order to obtain different muon thresholds .",
    "there is some weak evidence @xcite for a prompt muon component at a level corresponding to one prompt muon for every 1000 pions produced at the same energy .",
    "because of the small probability for pion decay at high energy , this would actually correspond to a rather large charm cross section .",
    "the raw measurements are , however , difficult to interpret  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising as there are many problems in detecting prompt muons with underground experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is also difficult to predict accurately the flux of prompt leptons because the experimental status of charm production at laboratory energies is rather confusing .",
    "especially large uncertainties are associated with the production of mesons and baryons in the feynman @xmath110 region . as is the case for strange particles ,",
    "the ( forward ) @xmath110 behavior is expected to vary strongly with the nature of the produced particle .",
    "neutrino and muon fluxes are rather sensitive to the behavior of the cross section at large @xmath111 because of the steep parent cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "theory can not come to the rescue .",
    "perturbative calculations are unreliable at low energies because of their sensitivity to the assumed quark mass and renormalization scale . because charm is predominantly produced by the fusion of gluons at high energies , the cross section critically depends on the low-@xmath112 behavior of the gluon structure function which is poorly or totally unknown depending on the energy@xcite .",
    "a calculation of the high - energy charm cross section is actually beyond the scope of perturbative qcd because it requires the resummation of large logarithms of @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "prompt neutrino ( or muon ) fluxes corresponding to five parametrizations of the high energy behavior of the charm production cross section @xcite are shown in fig .  5 ( solid lines ) .",
    "for comparison , we also show the conventional muon flux from the decay of pions and kaons .",
    "the left dashed line is for vertical muons and the right for horizontal .",
    "the prompt curves represent both neutrino and muon fluxes which are very nearly identical for two - body decays of massive particles into light leptons .",
    "the prompt muon flux from charm decay is independent of zenith angle up to @xmath114  gev .",
    "in contrast , the conventional muon and neutrino fluxes have a strong dependence on zenith angle , with a ratio of vertical to horizontal fluxes approaching an order of magnitude at high energy .",
    "prompt production dominates above an energy whose value depends on zenith angle and , of course , on the assumption for the high - energy charm cross section .",
    "this cross - over energy is lower for neutrinos than for muons because the conventional muon flux exceeds the conventional neutrino flux .",
    "the five models for the hadroproduction of charm are discussed in detail in reference  @xcite . as an extreme guess on the high side they assume a charm production cross section which is 10% of the total inelastic cross section , @xmath115  @xcite .",
    "it behaves like @xmath116 at high energies .",
    "the model is inspired by the fact that a high energy gluon fragments 10% of the time into charm particles , and its applicability is limited to energies above a few tev since at lower energies it violates charm cross - section measurements from accelerator experiments  @xcite . as a lower limit they evaluated the charm cross section from leading order perturbation theory  @xcite using relatively hard parton distributions .",
    "some interesting results have been obtained by an x - ray chamber array measuring the vertical muon spectrum up to 50  tev  @xcite .",
    "these data rule out the highest parametrization shown in fig .  5 , which is not totally surprising as it also overestimates the accelerator data at low energy .",
    "we therefore consider the curve labelled _ b _ in fig .  5 to be the upper limit for the atmospheric background of neutrinos above 100 tev .      cosmic rays with energy of order @xmath117  tev and higher",
    "initiate air showers which penetrate deeply enough to be studied with particle detectors at ground level .",
    "the detected flux is a steeply falling function of zenith angle because the depth of atmosphere traversed by a cascade reaching the ground rises rapidly from 1030 to 36000  g  @xmath118 as the zenith angle varies from zero to 90 degrees . thus near the horizon ( @xmath119 ) , close to a thousand radiation lengths of matter",
    "separate the interaction from the detector , and the configuration of the experiment is analogous to that of any accelerator - based beam dump experiment .",
    "most secondaries such as pions and kaons are absorbed in the dump and only penetrating particles , such as muons and neutrinos produced in the initial interaction , reach the detector .",
    "high energy muons will traverse the atmosphere and occasionally lose energy by catastrophic photon bremsstrahlung .",
    "if the photon shower is produced close to the detector it will be recorded and is referred to as a horizontal air shower . because horizontal air showers are a signature for penetrating particles in general , they can also be used to search for cosmic neutrinos , so we discuss them in some detail . for comparable muon and neutrino spectra , muons will dominate the horizontal air shower flux as a result of their larger interaction cross section .",
    "therefore energetic atmospheric muons constitute the main background for horizontal air showers from cosmic neutrinos .",

    "for example , from eq .",
    "( [ phi_gamma ] ) , and assuming a threshold of @xmath158  tev , we can estimate the number of neutrino events from within 10  degrees of the disc as 5  events per year for a 10@xmath55m@xmath56 detector at the south pole which views 1.1  steradian of the outer galaxy with an average density of 0.013  grams / cm@xmath56 .",
    "this would be increased to 15  events per year if the spectral index in the outer galaxy were indeed as small as 1.4 , as suggested by an analysis  @xcite of the gev @xmath143-ray results of the cos - b satellite .",

    "although these rates are significantly below the atmospheric background , the source is guaranteed and the event rate might be significantly higher if there are regions of the galaxy where the spectrum is flatter than the local spectrum .",
    "the above estimates assume a cosmic ray intensity that is constant throughout the disk of the galaxy and equal to that measured at earth .",
    "a recent comptel  @xcite observation of 3 to 7 mev fluxes from the region of orion may suggest , however , that the cosmic ray energy density could be significantly higher in that region . the observed @xmath143-ray line intensities ( from excited @xmath164c and @xmath185o nuclei ) would correspond to cosmic ray energy density of more than 50 ev @xmath186 , a factor of 100 higher than in the vicinity of the earth .",
    "although the lines are generated by cosmic ray nuclei of kinetic energy around 10 mev , which are subject to strong solar modulation inside the solar system , it is quite possible that the cosmic ray density in a wider energy range is significantly higher in this active star - formation region .",
    "the limits derived from the cos - b data@xcite allow a cosmic ray intensity and respectively neutrino fluxes higher by factor of 5 in the region of orion .",
    "the other guaranteed extraterrestrial source of high energy neutrinos is the sun .",
    "the production process is exactly the same as for atmospheric neutrinos ",
    "cosmic ray interactions in the solar atmosphere .",

    "the scaleheight of the chromosphere is @xmath51115 km , compared with 6.3 km for the upper atmosphere .",
    "as a result @xmath36 is higher by a factor of @xmath5120 , as is the energy where the slope of the neutrino spectrum increases .",
    "the difference is even larger for cosmic rays that enter the sun at large angles and never reach atmospheric densities higher than 10@xmath187 g/@xmath49 .",
    "a detailed calculation of the neutrino production by cosmic rays in the solar atmosphere  @xcite shows a neutrino spectrum higher than the angle averaged atmospheric flux by a factor of @xmath512 at 10 gev and a factor of @xmath513 at 1000 gev .",
    "the decisive factor for the observability of this neutrino source is the small solid angle ( 6.8@xmath18810@xmath189 sr ) of the sun . although the rate of the neutrino induced upward going muons is higher than the atmospheric emission from the same solid angle by a factor of @xmath515 , the rate of muons of energy above 10 gev in a 10@xmath55 m@xmath56 detector is only 5 per year . taking into account the diffusion of the cosmic rays in the solar wind , which decreases significantly the value of the flux for energies below one tev , cuts this event rate further by a factor of 3 . folded with a realistic angular resolution of 1 degree , observation of such an event rate also requires a 1 km@xmath56 detector .",

    "this source will resupply the galaxy and compensate for the loss of cosmic rays resulting from their limited confinement time  @xcite .",
    "let us next assume that a comparable amount of energy is absorbed by collisions of protons with gas near the high energy accelerators .",
    "then the total power in neutrinos is related to the neutrino flux at earth from all compact sources by @xmath199 here @xmath200 is the fraction of energy in an accelerated proton spectrum @xmath201 that goes into @xmath202 , @xmath203 describes the fraction of neutrinos that escape from the sources and @xmath204 is the distance to the @xmath205th source .",
    "if there are @xmath206 such sources distributed throughout the galactic plane , then an estimate of the distance to the nearest source is @xmath207 where @xmath208  kpc is a nominal radius of the disk in which the sources are concentrated .",
    "if each source has a particle luminosity of @xmath209 , then number of sources cancels in the relation between the total cosmic ray luminosity @xmath210 and the neutrino luminosity of a `` nearest neighbor '' source @xcite .",
    "one has @xmath211 from which we estimate the neutrino flux from a nearby source as @xmath212 assuming an @xmath213 spectrum .",
    "such a flux of high energy @xmath154 would give some 300 events per year in @xmath132  m@xmath56 .",

    "absorption arguments depend strongly on the exact mechanism",

    "it is , however , not only possible , but likely  @xcite that the high energy @xmath143-rays would be absorbed in @xmath215 collisions on the strong radiation field at the source . in this case the protons will not be absorbed since the photoproduction threshold is @xmath216 higher and the protons lose very little energy in @xmath217 collisions .",
    "the preceding argument is based on an assumed random distribution of point sources in the disk of the galaxy .",
    "because of the cancellation of the number @xmath206 of sources in eq .",

    "there could , however , be significant absorption of a high energy photon source from the galactic center .",
    "thus , as pointed out by berezinsky  @xcite , _ not _ seeing high energy neutrino emission from the center of the galaxy would be an interesting result .",

    "x - ray binaries consist of a compact object ( neutron star or a black hole ) and a non - compact companion star .",
    "such systems are dynamically complicated , involving mass transfer from the companion onto the compact object through an accretion disk .",

    "the existence of high magnetic fields and plasma flows creates the environment necessary for the formation of strong shocks , and corresponding particle acceleration .",
    "the companion star itself , the accretion flow , or the heavy stellar winds might be targets for inelastic nucleon interactions and neutrino production .",
    "calculations of the neutrino flux expected from cygnus x-3 were done independently by different authors  @xcite , and the results agree to better than a factor of two for similar assumptions about the input parameters and the configuration of the accelerated beam and beam dump .",

    "the estimated flux is a factor @xmath5110 lower here , however , because the models typically assume a 10% duty cycle for the beam to intercept the target mass ( e.g. the companion star ) .",
    "models motivated by the original cygnus x-3 observations in which the high energy gamma rays emerge from source obviously can not be correct for cygnus x-3 in view of the current limits from air shower observations .",
    "emission of neutrinos in other models in which the photons are absorbed can , however , be obtained by scaling from these calculations by an assumed proton luminosity and the distance of any potential source .",
    "the crucial question then is the luminosity that might be expected from such systems . for accretion powered sources the luminosity",
    "is limited by the eddington luminosity @xmath225 which is the maximum x - ray luminosity that will not prevent accretion .",
    "since the proton inelastic cross - section is lower than the thomson cross section @xmath226 , technically the proton luminosity can exceed @xmath227 . on the other hand @xmath227 can only be achieved at the surface of the neutron star and a realistic luminosity limit depends on the ratio of the neutron star radius to the shock radius @xmath228 .",
    "thus a reasonably optimistic limit for the proton luminosity will be @xmath229 i.e.  of the order of or lower than @xmath230  erg / s , corresponding to a rate of upward tev muons @xmath231 events per year in a @xmath132  m@xmath56 detector for a source at 10 kpc .    another potential source of energy in an x - ray binary is pulsar rotation .",
    "harding & gaisser  @xcite have studied proton acceleration at x - ray binaries powered by the pulsar through a pulsar wind shock .",
    "an absolute upper bound on the energy is the power released by magnetic dipole radiation , @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the pulsar surface magnetic field strength in 10@xmath164  g and @xmath234 is the pulsar period in milliseconds . discussing different x - ray systems , however , they end up with a maximum proton acceleration luminosity of @xmath235  erg / s for cygnus x-3 with a pulsar period of 12.8  ms @xcite .",
    "this is still factor of 2 smaller than the luminosities used in the cygnus x-3 estimates above and illustrates that an x - ray binary has to put almost all of its energy in high energy protons to be detectable in neutrinos . for a more modest x - ray binary at the galactic center that accelerates 1/10 @xmath227 in high - energy protons",

    "if the accelerated protons are not confined in the shell , the duration of the signal would be 12 years @xcite .",

    "although it is clear now that sn1987a does not contain a strong pulsar , it is still of interest to discuss the signal that could be expected from a a young galactic supernova ( @xmath5110  kpc ) with a rapidly spinning , strongly magnetized pulsar .",

    "berezinsky & ptuskin  @xcite argued that acceleration at the supernova blast wave could also produce an observable signal , even though in this case the accelerated particles are not deep inside the expanding shell .",
    "when a supernova expands into the surrounding medium it drives a blast wave ahead .",
    "there is also a reverse shock in the supernova ejecta .",
    "particle acceleration occurs at both shocks , with the accelerated particles injected into the respective downstream regions , which are contained between the two shocks .",
    "the kinetic energy of the expanding shell is huge ( of order @xmath244  erg / s ) but the rate at which it is dissipated is limited by the rate at which matter is swept up by the expanding shell .",
    "thus the luminosity from accelerated particles in this region is quite sensitive ( quadratically  @xcite ) to the mass loss rate of the progenitor star , which was relatively low for sn1987a .",
    "for what is considered a `` typical '' mass loss rate of @xmath245  @xcite , the estimated neutrino flux for a supernova at 10  kpc corresponds to several hundred upward muons with @xmath246 in the first 100 days @xcite .",
    "the rate falls off slightly faster than 1/t .",
    "the big disadvantage of young supernova remnants as potential neutrino sources is , of course , that supernova explosions are rare events .",

    "shock acceleration models were at least crudely incorporated into the agn models , and the photoproduction process was shown to be the most important one for proton energy loss .",
    "this led to estimates of the maximum proton energy achievable in acceleration at agn shocks and to the prediction of high energy neutrino fluxes .",
    "active galactic nuclei have luminosities ranging from 10@xmath248 to 10@xmath249 erg / s , which corresponds to black hole masses from 10@xmath250 to 10@xmath48 @xmath251 @xcite on the natural assumption that they are powered by eddington limited accretion onto a black hole .",

    "x - rays have a hard , nonthermal spectrum , variable on even shorter timescales@xcite , which often cuts off at several mev .",
    "agn s have been extensively studied at radio frequencies , where the most general identification is as radio-_loud _ or radio-_quiet _ , depending on the fraction of energy in the radio portion of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "roughly 10% of all observed agn s are classified as radio - loud @xcite .",
    "blandford @xcite suggests that radio - loud agn s have rapidly spinning black holes and therefore also strong jets .",
    "the uv bump is not always easy to see in radioloud agn s .",

    "the model is based on work performed by kazanas , protheroe and ellison @xcite .",
    "they assume that close to the black hole the accretion flow becomes spherical and a shock is formed where the ram pressure of the accretion flow is balanced by radiation pressure near the black hole .",
    "the shock radius is parameterized by @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is the gravitational ( schwarzschild ) radius of the black hole , and @xmath255 is estimated to be in the range @xmath256 to @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "the continuous emission is dominated by the ultraviolet and x - ray radiation , which are assumed to emanate from inside the radius enclosed by the shock .",
    "since the region inside the shock is optically thick , the radiation density at the shock can be estimated from the surface brightness of the agn .",

    "thus , estimates of expected neutrino fluxes from individual agn s are normalized through the model to their observed x - ray luminosities .",

    "the flux is shown by a dotted line in fig .",
    "this model @xcite of the proton acceleration and interactions envisions a bulk flow of magnetized plasma , streaming from the base of the jet towards its end ( the hot spot ) .",

    "the radiating sheet thickness should be @xmath374 cm , much smaller than its radius ( @xmath375 cm ) .",
    "the acceleration of protons ( and possibly nuclei ) proceeds _ via _ first order fermi acceleration in the frame of the flowing plasma . as usual , the acceleration rate is given by ( compare eq .",

    "the fact that the dominant energy loss process for high energy protons in the hadronic model of agn jets is photoproduction at threshold in collisions on a power law spectrum of photons ( rather than a thermal spectrum ) has an interesting consequence also for the shape of the produced spectrum of secondary pions .",
    "if , as expected in first order shock acceleration , the differential proton spectrum is @xmath213 , then the differential pion production spectrum will be harder by one power of energy , i.e. @xmath382 . occasionally energetic protons also collide with thermal gas in the jet , which leads to an @xmath213 spectrum of pions .",

    "neutralino masses less than a few tens of gev have been excluded by unsuccessful collider searches .",

    "the angular response of the detector is being tuned to be much more isotropic than either amanda or dumand , which will give it advantages in , for instance , the study of neutrino oscillations .",
    "secondly , nestor will have a higher density of photocathode ( in some substantial volume ) than the other detectors , and will be able to make local coincidences on lower energy events , even perhaps down to the supernova energy range ( tens of mev ) .",

    "even if any of these are built it would seem that the costs may be too large to contemplate a full , kilometer - scale detector .    in summary",
    ", there are four major experiments proceeding with construction , each of which has different strengths and faces different challenges . for the construction of a 1  km scale detector one can imagine any of the above detectors being the basic building block for the ultimate 1  km@xmath488 telescope . the redesigned amanda detector ( with spacings optimized to the attenuation length in excess of 60  m ) , for example , consists of 5 strings on a circle with 60  meter radius around a string at the center ( referred to as a @xmath489 configuration ) .",
    "each string contains 13 oms separated by 15 - 20  m. its effective volume is just below @xmath490 .",
    "imagine amanda `` supermodules '' which are obtained by extending the basic string length ( and module count per string ) by a factor close to 4 .",
    "supermodules would then consist of @xmath489 strings with 51 oms separated by 20  meters on each string , for a total length of 1  km .",
    "a 1  km scale detector then might consist of a @xmath491 configuration of supermodules , with the 7 supermodules distributed on a circle of radius 250  m and 7 more on a circle of 500  m. the full detector then contains 4590 phototubes , which is less than the 7000 used in the sno detector . such a detector ( see fig .",
    "17 ) can be operated in a dual mode :    * it obviously consists of roughly @xmath492 the presently designed amanda array , leading to an effective volume of @xmath493  m@xmath488 .",
    "importantly , the characteristics of the detector , including threshold in the gev - energy range , are the same as those of the amanda array module .",
    "* the @xmath491 supermodule configuration , looked at as a whole , instruments a 1  km@xmath488 cylinder with diameter and height of 1000  m with optical modules .",
    "high - energy muons will be superbly reconstructed as they can produce triggers in 2 or more of the supermodules spaced by large distance .",
    "reaching more than one supermodule ( range of 250  m ) requires energy of 50  gev .",
    "we note that this is the energy for which a neutrino telescope has optimal sensitivity to a typical @xmath213 source ( background falls with threshold energy , and until about 1  tev little signal is lost ) .",
    "alternate methods to reach the 1  km scale have been discussed by learned and roberts  @xcite .",
    "how realistic are the construction costs for such a detector ?",
    "amanda s strings ( with 10 oms ) cost $ 150,000 including deployment . by naive scaling",
    "the final cost of the postulated @xmath491 array of supermodules is of order $ 75 million , comparable to that of superkamiokande  @xcite ( with @xmath494  inch photomultiplier tubes in a 40  m diameter by 40  m high stainless steel tank in a deep mine ) .",
    "it is clear that the naive estimate makes several approximations over- and underestimating the actual cost .    in the next and final section of this paper",
    "we will briefly review alternate ideas for making a kilometer - scale neutrino detector in a cost - effective manner .",
    "over 30 years ago the suggestion was first made that radio antennas might be able to detect microwave emission from neutrino - induced cascades  @xcite .",
    "this method can in principle lead to the construction of relatively inexpensive neutrino telescopes . until recently only rough estimates have been made of the power",
    "emitted  @xcite .",
    "they indicated that the detection threshold is quite high , so high that the technique is probably insensitive to the atmospheric neutrinos .    that the radio signals emitted by neutrino - induced electromagnetic cascades are even close to observability is the result of interesting physics .",
    "according to the frank - tamm formula the power radiated by a particle with charge @xmath495 travelling a pathlength @xmath496 in a medium of refractive index @xmath206 is given by  @xcite @xmath497z^2\\nu \\left[1-{1\\over\\beta^2 n^2}\\right]l\\ ; , \\label{dw / dnu }   \\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the frequency and @xmath498 .",
    "naively one might expect the power generated in a shower of @xmath8 charged particles to be proportional to @xmath499 .",

    "if the emitted wavelength is large compared to the physical dimensions of the shower , or equivalently , the electric pulse generated by the shower is short compared to the period of the waves observed , then the emission by the shower particles is coherent and the power is of order @xmath500  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath501 is the excess negative charge in the shower @xmath502 which enters in the coherent case because the electric fields from opposite charges cancel for the same @xmath503 .",

    "the technique has been successfully tested in experiments measuring radio emission by air showers observed in coincidence with particle arrays  @xcite . whereas atmospheric fluctuations make the systematics of the radioemission difficult to handle , this is not a problem in denser material , like ice .",
    "the physical dimension of the shower is reduced because the radiation length is only 39  cm .",
    "the coherence is retained to higher frequencies , where more energy is available .",
    "determination of the precise threshold for observation in a medium like ice depends on the details of the cascade and one has to perform a real time numerical simulation of electromagnetic cascades in ice .",
    "the calculations  @xcite show that to a very good precision the enhancement factor from coherence @xmath504 is proportional to the primary energy , and therefore the power of the radioemission is proportional to the square of the cascade energy .    the critical parameter is the energy threshold for detection which not only depends on the power generated but also on the absorption in the ice and the background noise from the apparatus and its environment .",

    ", neutrino - induced showers can dominate at sufficiently high energies .",
    "in addition to charge current @xmath202 interactions , there will be a contribution from @xmath516 .",
    "for flat spectra and @xmath517 and @xmath9 fluxes of a similar order of magnitude , the resonant @xmath518 production dominates the rate of @xmath78-induced horizontal air showers for shower sizes in the narrow range @xmath519  to  @xmath520 $ ] .",
    "horizontal shower measurements  @xcite have been compared to expectations from diffuse agn fluxes in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the potential of air shower arrays for detection of diffuse neutrino fluxes was demonstrated .",
    "similar limits have been obtained recently by the eastop collaboration  @xcite .",
    "muon - poor showers are selected in the tokyo data  @xcite , so that the limit is stronger for @xmath516 fluxes , which actually dominate the neutrino - induced horizontal air shower signal .    figure 18 shows the rate of ( muon - poor ) horizontal showers associated with the neutrino emission by active galaxies .",
    "also shown is the background from atmospheric muons .",
    "the signal - to - background increases with shower size and exceeds unity for shower sizes exceeding @xmath484 for the prediction of reference  @xcite .",
    "the figure illustrates the kind of sensitivity air shower arrays can reach in the detection of cosmic neutrinos .",
    "an improved detection method would be to select all , not only muon - poor , showers that are very close to the horizon .",
    "this would avoid any contamination from cosmic rays without rejecting hadron - like neutrino induced showers . unless prompt muon production by charm turns out to be unexpectedly large , the larger of the range of agn isotropic backgrounds of szabo and protheroe  @xcite should be detectable by a horizontal shower measurement with enough exposure to detect showers with @xmath521 .",
    "a flux peaked at energies exceeding 1  pev , will be strongly attenuated in the earth and only detectable in upward going muons close to horizontal angles . under these circumstances , neutrino detection via horizontal air showers may be a useful alternative detection method . +",
