    "last ideas in these series are suggestions by n. arkani - hamed ,  @xcite and by l. randall and r. sundrum  @xcite for using large extra dimensions and localized matter to solve mass hierarchy problem inspired by some previous works of v. rubakov and m. shaposhinkov  @xcite on domain walls in higher dimensional spaces and p. horava and e. witten  @xcite on m - theory models with compactification in spaces with d - brane boundaries .    in the first proposals only gravity could propagate in the bulk .",
    "it has been however found that the total localization of all fields except graviton on 3-branes is not realistic .",
    "in fact brane solution are cosmologically unstable and at least one scalar bulk field ( radion )  @xcite  @xcite is necessary to stabilize the distance between branes . in some brane models",
    "inflaton  @xcite also has to propagate to the bulk to make inflation with necessary properties",
    ". a deeper insight to the propagation of gravitational waves and massive particles with bulk modes in models with infinite bulk has illustrated that even the warping of the bulk can not stop their escape from branes  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "most of localization mechanisms are evolutionary i.e. based on special configuration of matter fields with localized properties like topological defect solutions which can arise during phase transitions in the early universe  @xcite . in these models",
    "the real dimensionality of the space - time is larger than @xmath1 but our universe is confined to a domain wall ( 3-brane ) where fields specially at low energies ( with respect to quantum gravity scale ) are geometrically or gravitationally localized .",
    "however , geometrical settings like a warped metric are not always enough to confine fields on the branes .",
    "it has been shown that in spaces with @xmath2 extra - dimensions gravity can not be geometrically confined to a 3-brane and p - form fields in the bulk must be added to stabilize the brane ( defect )  @xcite . in 5-dim .",
    "models gravity and scalar fields can be localized on the brane with negative tension  @xcite ( or the brane with smallest value of warp factor in 2-brane models of  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "warp geometry can localize fermions only on the positive tension brane ( which can not solve the hierarchy problem ) .",
    "vector fields can not be geometrically confined .",
    "localization of gauge fields and fermions on the negative tension brane is achievable through special particle physics setups  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the localization scale however is considered to be not much higher than warping scale , otherwise a new hierarchy can appear  @xcite . at higher energies",
    "one expects that symmetry restoration ( e.g. chiral symmetry of fermions ) leads to escape of particles from the brane .",
    "even when a warped geometry is enough to confine fields on the brane , the wave function of the zero mode can penetrate to the bulk ( but has an exponential maximum on the brane )  @xcite . in infinite bulk models kk continuum begins from @xmath3 and this affects the long range behavior of gravity and other massless fields  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "massive fields if they have bulk modes can decay to the bulk with a life time which depends on the fundamental scale of gravity  @xcite  @xcite . for orbifoldized models",
    "the spectrum of kk modes is discrete .",

    "a detail investigation of observable signal of the rs type models in tevatron and lhc are performed in  @xcite and kk - mode production in the early universe in  @xcite .",
    "the existent and near future accelerators can constrain the scale of gravity ( and thus the size of the extra - dimensions ) up to @xmath5 .",
    "the interaction of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) with protons in the terrestrial atmosphere has a cm energy close to @xmath6 and is the most energetic interaction of elementary particles we can study today .",
    "it can be used to constrain the fundamental scale of gravity and the compactification scale up to much higher energies .",
    "the mass of kk modes detected by an observer on the brane is the result of smeared dimensions in the wave function .",
    "classically however , it can be interpreted as a delay in the displacement of particles .",
    "for the observer on the brane if the delay slightly modifies the propagation of the particle in the detector , it is interpreted as a larger particle mass , otherwise it is seen as an arrival delay , specially with respect to the particles which propagate only on the brane . in the case of an air shower , the time coherence of the showers will be destroyed .    in this work",
    "we calculate the minimum propagation time of particles ejected to extra - dimensions for a number of warped brane models and compare them with arrival time resolution of present air shower detectors .",
    "we restrict our study to @xmath7 models .",
    "this is enough for understanding the general characteristics of the propagation in extra - dimension from the point of view of an observer on a @xmath8-brane and can be considered as a special configuration for models with higher dimensions .",
    "our attention is mostly concentrated on the classical structure of the brane models because results are independent of the detail of quantum field contents and origin of the branes . however , before doing this we must assess the possibility and the probability that uhecrs interaction in the atmosphere can produce bulk modes i.e. escaping particles .",
    "given the rarity of uhecrs , only models in which the probability of production of bulk modes is very high can be constrained by this method .",
    "the whole idea of constraining brane models with uhecrs depends on the possibility and probability that remnants of uhecr interaction in the atmosphere can penetrate into the extra - dimensions . in this section",
    "we review the localization of fields on the brane with a special attention on models which provide bulk modes i.e. not all fields are confined to the visible brane at all energies .",
    "we estimate the probability of producing these modes at energy scale of interaction between uhecrs and nucleons in the terrestrial atmosphere .    by definition in universal models",
    "@xcite any field has bulk modes and propagates in all space - time dimensions .",
    "the interesting case for solving the hierarchy problem is when the size of the compactified dimensions are of the order of weak interaction or lower is much larger than @xmath9 ( see sec .   for definition )",

    "this is @xmath10 orders of magnitude smaller than the cm energy of uhecrs interaction .",
    "therefore in the case of universal models , uhecrs can produce lowest kk - modes abundantly . in  @xcite it",
    "is argued that uhecrs can not probe the physics at very high energies simply because their interactions is dominantly electromagnetic .",
    "it is true that probability of the exchange of a heavy particle e.g a massive boson related to symmetries beyond standard model is very small with respect to a low transverse momentum em cascade .",
    "however , in universal models as sm fields have bulk modes at very high energies all dimensions are `` seen '' as to be the same and the parameter space of em cascades with non - zero momentum component in the extra - dimensions is much larger than cascades restricted to the three infinite dimensions . in the language of kk - modes , with a good accuracy the lowest modes can be considered as massless and they can be produced with the same probability as zero modes . in the following subsections",
    "we argue that for non - universal models one expects that at the cm energy of uhecrs interaction , most of localization mechanisms be no longer active and standard model particles can escape to the bulk .      in warped models scalars and spin-2 fields",
    "can be confined geometrically .",
    "the zero mode of these fields has an exponentially decreasing wave function in the bulk  @xcite  @xcite . for models with infinite bulk",
    "the kk - spectrum begins from zero and therefore there is not a real confined zero mode .",
    "in addition , if the field has a non - zero 5-dim .",
    "mass , it has been shown  @xcite that 4-dim mass eigen modes on the brane are complex and decay to the bulk with a width : / m_4 ( m_4/)^2 m_4 ^ 2 = m_5 ^ 2 / 2 [ mwidth ] where @xmath11 is the real part of the 4-dim .",

    "massive modes have a yukawa type potential and their coupling is exponentially suppressed  @xcite .",
    "however , if the @xmath11 is much smaller than cm energy , the effect of exponential term in yukawa potential is negligible . for most energetic uhecrs",
    "this means that the coupling to modes as massive as @xmath15 is roughly the same as massless modes .",
    "the width in depends on the effective 5-dim .",
    "mass of the field and the warping scale .",
    "we discuss their implication on the decay of massive modes to the bulk and on the test of brane models in section [ secmodels ] .",
    "the above argument is also true in the case of 2-brane models where the spectrum is discrete .",
    "we show briefly that in static / quasi - static models the zero mode of scalar / spin-2 fields with @xmath16 has an imaginary part i.e. it decays to the bulk ( see also  @xcite ) .",

    "to one finds that on the brane at @xmath42 for @xmath43 : ~ [ couple ] in our approximation @xmath44 , @xmath45 and it can be even larger than 1 .",

    "the detail of the formalism is very similar to the case of a scalar field except that the mass eigenstate equation includes a chiral mass term due to interaction of fermion modes with a bulk scalar responsible for the symmetry breaking .",
    "the width of the zero mode depends on the coupling between fermions and the inferred scalar field and without detail knowledge of underlying particle physics it is difficult to assess the probability of decay to the bulk . for 2-brane models",

    "do nt fix the scale of the symmetry breaking . for not creating a new hierarchy",
    "however it can not be much larger than compactification scale  @xcite or fundamental scale of gravity @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , at energy scale of uhecrs interaction in the atmosphere , not only it is possible to produce kk - modes , it is very probable that at such energies the restoration of chiral symmetry completely removes the confinement of fermions and open the extra - dimension even to fermionic zero modes ( presumably sm matter ) .    as for gauge bosons , the most successful scenario for their confinement on the branes",
    "is based on adding an induced kinetic term to the action of bulk gauge fields on the brane .",
    "it appears due to the interaction of these fields with confined charged scalar or fermions on the branes  @xcite .",
    "other suggestions are mostly equivalent to this scenario  @xcite .",
    "once the charged fields become able to escape to the bulk , they drag their interaction vertex with gauge fields to the bulk and release them from confinement .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the coupling of gauge boson kk - modes to fermions on the brane is stronger than coupling of their corresponding zero - mode ( similar to the self coupling of scalars ) .",
    "the general conclusion of this section is that regarding :    * _ _ *    - very high cm energy of interaction of most energetic cosmic rays in the atmosphere which is much higher than natural confinement scale of standard model particles on the brane and natural fundamental scale of gravity to solve the hierarchy problem ;    - the fact that confinement of sm fields is not intrinsic but the result of either a broken symmetry ( for fermions ) or interactions ( for bosons ) ;    - that the particle physics in 5-dim can not be completely massless and at least part of the particle spectrum must acquire mass as it is the case in observable 4-dim universe .",
    "in fact as radion is in fact the scalar component of 5-dim .",
    "metric perturbations  @xcite , it couples to all bulk fields and radiatively induces a small mass term .",
    "consequently , zero - modes ( presumably sm particles ) are not stable and in a finite time decay to the bulk unless another phenomenon like symmetry breaking prevent it ;    the phase space of production of bulk modes at high energy tail of uhecrs spectra seems to be higher than confined modes .",
    "until now more than 100 coherent air showers have been observed with @xmath52 ( assuming interaction with nucleons in the atmosphere ) , 17 between them have energies more than @xmath53 and one has a cm energy close to @xmath54  @xcite . assuming that uhecrs interaction with @xmath52 produces bulk modes abundantly , the mere observation of coherent showers up to energies close to @xmath55 constraints the parameter space of brane models .    as the assessment of cross - sections and other details are model dependent , in the rest of this work we simplify the problem of constraining brane models and consider only the classical propagation of the bulk modes .",
    "this method has been already used by other authors to study some of cosmological consequences of brane models  @xcite  @xcite .",

    "one brane models with interesting range of @xmath51 are ruled out .",
    "this study has an additional interesting conclusion : the close relation between a very small but non - zero cosmological constant and the smallness of the newton coupling constant ( i.e. the hierarchy problem ) .",
