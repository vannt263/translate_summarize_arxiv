    "young open clusters have become a fertile hunting ground for very low - mass ( vlm ) star and brown dwarf ( bd ) surveys .",
    "they offer the advantage that the vlm members are relatively bright and share the distance and metallicity derived from higher mass stars . the successful identification of bds in the pleiades ( basri , marcy & graham 1996 , hereafter @xcite ; rebolo et al .",
    "@xcite ) is a good example of how this advantage can be exploited .",
    "the open cluster @xmath0  persei ( melotte 20 ) is one of the youngest open clusters within a radius of 200  pc from the sun .",
    "it is listed with an age of 50  myr and a true distance modulus of m - m=6.36 in the catalogue of lynga ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the trigonometric parallax observations of the hipparcos satellite have yielded a true distance modulus of 6.33@xmath30.09 ( mermilliod et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which is consistent with previous estimates . being younger than the pleiades , and only a little more distant , @xmath0  per offers the opportunity of studying vlm objects at an earlier evolutionary stage .",
    "the `` lithium test '' for substellarity was first proposed and applied to a bd candidate found in @xmath0  persei ( rebolo , martn & magazz @xcite ) . since then",
    ", it has been applied to bd suspects in the pleiades and the field ( basri @xcite ) , and has been used for constraining their ages and masses ( @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we search for lithium in several of the faintest candidate members of @xmath0  per taken from rebolo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and prosser ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the faintest of these objects ( ap270 in prosser s list ) is indeed a ` bona fide ' cluster member and has a detectable lithium line .",
    "we discuss the age and mass of this object using recent evolutionary models , and the methodology of `` lithium dating '' developed by @xcite ( cf .",
    "basri @xcite ) .",
    "that work has shown that the pleiades is substantially older than thought based on classical analysis of the upper main sequence turnoff ( umst ) stars . because lithium dating can provide a means of calibrating the convective overshoot in umst stars ( which affects their ages ) , it is important to confirm that this effect is generally seen in young clusters . by studying enough such clusters , the value of the overshoot parameter as a function of stellar mass could in principle be determined .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic observations of five of the faintest candidate members of @xmath0  persei from the list of prosser ( @xcite ) were obtained at the keck  i telescope , using the hires echelle spectrometer ( vogt et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the instrumental configuration and data reduction procedure were the same as in @xcite . with a dispersion of about 0.01 nm per ( binned ) pixel ,",

    "the targets observed are listed in table  [ tab1 ] ; the typical exposure time for the ap stars was about one hour .",

    "wavelength coverage provided by this instrumental setup was 0.88 nm and 472.61023.2  nm , respectively .",
    "standard reduction and calibration procedures were accomplished with iraf routines .",
    "we corrected for the instrumental response using the flux standard hd  84937 ( stone @xcite ) .",
    "near - infrared observations of 12 candidate members from prosser ( @xcite ) were carried out on 1997 sept 10 and 12 at the lick 1  m telescope with the lirc  2 camera ( gilmore , rank & temi @xcite ) .",
    "the detector is a nicmos-3 256@xmath6 pixel array with a field of view of 7.2 arcmin@xmath6 .",
    "we used the standard @xmath7 and @xmath8 filter set .",
    "total exposure times ranged from 60  s to 300  s in each filter .",
    "we dithered the telescope making a square of 30 arcsec on the side .",
    "the iraf daophot package was applied to reduce the frames and extract the photometry .",
    "instrumental aperture magnitudes were corrected for atmospheric extinction and transformed into the ukirt system ( leggett @xcite ) using observations of the stars in the field of the pleiades bd calar  3 as standards ( zapatero osorio , martn & rebolo @xcite ) .",
    "we found that our @xmath8 photometry was useless because the background was too high and variable .",
    "thus , we give only the @xmath7-band photometry in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the  1  @xmath9 error is @xmath100.1 mag .",
    "we measured heliocentric radial velocities for the five @xmath0  persei candidate members observed with hires by cross - correlating the spectra of three echelle orders with our spectrum of the m6v template gl  406 obtained during the same run ( on dec .",
    "the spectral orders chosen cover the wavelength ranges 786.4797.5  nm , 804.2815.6  nm , and 822.9834.6  nm which contain hundreds of sharp molecular lines ( mainly tio and vo ) .",
    "they are not contaminated by strong telluric lines .",
    "the errors were estimated from the dispersion among radial velocities obtained from the different echelle orders , and are always @xmath101 pixel .",
    "we adopt a radial velocity for gl  406 of @xmath11=19.2@xmath30.15 km s@xmath5 from x. delfosse ( personal communication ) .",
    "it supersedes his published value with a new determination based on four more observations and a better template .",
    "we also derived our own independent absolute radial velocity for gl 406 using several atomic lines , obtaining 18.4@xmath31 km s@xmath5 .",
    "our radial velocity determinations for the program stars are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "our hires spectra are also useful for measuring the rotational broadening ( _ v _  sin_i _ ) .",
    "we used the same echelle orders as for the radial velocity measurements described above . for calibration",
    "we convolved the spectrum of gl  406 ( _ v _",
    "sin_i_@xmath102.9  km  s@xmath5 ; delfosse et al .",
    "@xcite ) with successive values of _ v _",
    "sin_i _ in intervals of 10  km  s@xmath5 , and cross - correlated these convolved spectra with the original spectrum .",
    "the resulting correlation functions were compared with each of the correlation functions between a program star and the spectrum of gl  406 to find the best the rotational velocity . in particular ,",
    "a gaussian was fit to the core of each correlation function , and the gaussian width used to make the comparison .",
    "this procedure is similar to that employed by basri & marcy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the _ v _",
    "sin_i _ values obtained for the program stars are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the errors reflect the dispersion in values obtained from the different orders , while the value itself is found by first averaging all the correlation functions for a given star .",
    "the hires spectra were also used for measuring the strength of selected atomic lines .",
    "several interesting optical lines present in late m - type stars were included in our spectral range .",
    "we focus on three features : h@xmath0 , lii at 670.8 nm , and ki at 769.9 nm , because they are indicators of chromospheric activity , nuclear burning in the interior , and surface gravity , respectively .",
    "all our program stars showed h@xmath0 in emission with single - peaked profiles .",
    "the equivalent widths are given in table  [ tab1 ] , along with upper limits for the equivalent width of the lii in the stars where we do not detect it .",
    "these were measured by making estimates of the pseudocontinuum by eye and taking a reasonable range of possibilities to estimate the errors .",
    "the spectra are noisy , and many features are not real , so the error estimate may be liberal . only in ap270",
    "is there a detection of lithium , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the apparent absorption features on either side of the line are not real , and its asymmetry should not be taken seriously .",
    "we note that our upper limits to the lii equivalent width are substantially lower than those obtained by zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) from lower - resolution spectra of ap275 and ap279 . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we present the ki region .",
    "much of the blue wing of the ki feature lies outside the recorded spectral domain .",
    "nevertheless , we can clearly see that the ki line in ap270 is narrower than in the m6 dwarf gl406 .",
    "this difference is due to the lower gravity in the young @xmath0  per object compared to the older main sequence star .",
    "we used our kast spectra to measure pseudocontinuum ratios that are known to be good spectral type indicators for m - type stars ( martn et al .",
    "we used the published values of the pc2 , pc3 , and pc4 indices for field dwarfs of known spectral type .",
    "the pc1 and pc5 indices are within our spectral range but our spectra are too noisy at those wavelengths .",
    "the mean spectral subclass and 1  @xmath9 dispersion obtained from the pc2 , pc3 and pc4 indices are shown in table  [ tab2 ] . for ap275",
    "our spectral type is consistent with that of zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "according to prosser ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the mean heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath0  persei members is -2  km s@xmath5 .",
    "the radial velocities of ap270 and ap275 are close to the cluster mean , supporting membership . on the other hand , ap273 and ap279 have much too high radial velocities , indicating nonmembership .",
    "no radial velocity change larger than the measurement uncertainty was detected between the two spectra of ap273 ( or those of ap270 ) taken on different nights .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the high radial velocity of ap273 is due to a close companion .",
    "the radial velocity of ap281 is higher than any of the high confidence @xmath0  per members .",
    "nevertheless , we consider this star a possible member because of its very high rotation velocity and good agreement with the cluster photometric sequence ( see below ) .",
    "it is conceivable that the radial velocity is variable due to an unresolved companion .",
    "we do not find any trace of the companion in our spectrum so it would have to be much fainter than the primary ( possibly a bd ) .",
    "more high resolution spectra are needed in order to test this hypothesis .",
    "a color - color diagram displaying the locus of kinematically young disk field dwarfs ( leggett @xcite ) is presented in figure  [ fig3 ] together with the ap stars that we have measured at the lick 1-m telescope .",
    "we have dereddened the ap stars by the mean color excess of e(v - i)@xmath12=0.16 ( prosser @xcite ) .",
    "most of the ap stars are located around the young disk star locus .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two most deviant stars are ap273 and ap279 which are nonmembers according to their radial velocities .",
    "these examples show that color - color diagrams can be provide a very useful diagnostic of cluster membership , particularly in a cluster of low galactic latitude like @xmath0  per ( b=-5.9@xmath13 ) where there can be a significant amount of contamination from galactic disk stars .",
    "we deem ap276 to be a nonmember of @xmath0  per because it has too early a spectral type for its ( v - i ) color .",
    "our final judgments concerning the membership of the ap stars studied in this paper are provided in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "stars for which we believe there is a high confidence of membership are flagged with ",
    "y , while those with less confidence are flagged with ` y : ' , usually due to lack of kinematic information .",
    "ap281 is kinematically a nonmember unless its radial velocity is variable .",
    "our results further confirm that @xmath0  persei vlm members have h@xmath0 in emission as expected for their young age .",
    "this diagnostic in young clusters has been discussed by eg .",
    "prosser , stauffer & kraft @xcite , and for @xmath0  per in particular by prosser @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the nonmembers ap273 and ap279 also have h@xmath0 in emission .",
    "hence , h@xmath0 does not seem to be a powerful criterion for cluster membership .",
    "zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found that the maximum h@xmath0 emission equivalent widths among @xmath0  persei stars occur around spectral type m4 , and does not rise or even declines toward cooler members .",
    "our h@xmath0 measurements are consistent with this .",
    "a similar behavior has also been observed among vlm members of the pleiades cluster ( hodgkin , jameson & steele @xcite ; stauffer , liebert & giampapa @xcite ) .",
    "the decrease in h@xmath0 emission could be due to a reduction of the efficiency of the turbulent dynamo in generating chromospheric activity . in field stars",
    "the decline of h@xmath0 emission has also been observed , although at cooler temperatures ( spectral type m7 or later ; basri et al .",
    "the difference in the spectral type at which h@xmath0 emission becomes very weak between the young open clusters and the field vlm stars indicates that this phenomenon may be time - dependent .",
    "the rotation velocities of the faintest @xmath0  per members observed by us are moderately high , which is not surprising because the stars are young .",
    "the rotation velocity of ap275 is lower than the equatorial rotation velocity derived from the photometric period ( martn & zapatero osorio @xcite ) , indicating that the star is viewed at a moderate inclination .",
    "what is surprising is that the radial velocity nonmembers ap279 and especially ap281 have rather high _ v _",
    "sin_i_. rotational velocities",
    "@xmath1420  km  s@xmath5 are unusual among m5m6 dwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( delfosse et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since ap279 and ap281 were discovered in a photometric survey , which is unbiased with respect to rotation or chromospheric activity , there is no reason that they should be young if they do not belong to the cluster .",
    "as noted above , ap281 might be cluster member if it is a spectroscopic binary .",
    "but this possibility is unlikely for ap279 because it fails to match the cluster sequence in the color - color plot ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we do not have a firm explanation for why these stars are rotating so fast if not members of @xmath0  per .",
    "the hyades ( @xmath4600 myr ) contains some m5 members with _",
    "v_sin_i _ in the range 2040  km  s@xmath5 ( jones , fischer & stauffer @xcite ) .",
    "even higher velocities appear to be the norm at the age of the pleiades ( oppenheimer et al .",
    "the latter paper discusses stars which satisfy almost all cluster membership criteria , yet are very unlikely to be members .",
    "we can speculate ( as did oppenheimer et al .",
    "@xcite ) that there is an enhancement in the number of relatively young field stars in the general direction of these northern winter clusters .",
    "the location of our program stars in a color - magnitude diagram is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we have also plotted the positions of pleiades stars from the proper motion study of hambly , hawkins & jameson ( @xcite ) with ir photometry provided by steele , jameson & hambly ( @xcite ) . also shown",
    "are pleiades bds with lithium detections ( rebolo et al .",
    "@xcite ; martn et al .",
    "@xcite ) including ir photometry from zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "if we disregard the kinematic nonmembers ap273 and ap279 , the rest of the ap objects define a relatively narrow sequence in this diagram , including the uncertain member ap281 .",
    "on the other hand , the pleiades stars occupy a much wider region .",
    "the @xmath15-band photometry for many of these stars comes from photographic plates and could be inaccurate ( steele & jameson @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that there are contaminating field stars in the pleiades sample , even though it has been selected from a proper motion study .",
    "for instance , martn et al . ( @xcite ) recently found that hhj  7 is a nonmember on the basis of low - resolution spectroscopy , and several other hhj stars are suspected nonmembers because they lie below the main - sequence .",
    "furthermore , steele & jameson ( @xcite ) have shown that part of the spread is due to unresolved binaries .    the @xmath0  persei stars overlap with the brighter half of their pleiades counterparts , suggesting that it is on the average a younger sample .",
    "however , the scatter seen in the pleiades prevents a more detailed comparison .",
    "theoretical isochrones for 30 , 50 , 70 and 100  myr ( baraffe et al .",
    "@xcite ) computed using nextgen model atmospheres ( allard et al .",
    "@xcite ) are superimposed on the data in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the isochrones are parallel to the general observed sequence .",
    "all the @xmath0  per members lie above the 70  myr isochrone , and most are even above the 50  myr one .",
    "however , we do not think that @xmath0  per stars are younger than 50  myr because it would not be consistent with any other age estimates , as discussed below .",
    "we note that there could be problems with the isochrones of baraffe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) mainly due to the water absorption line list which affects the ir colors ( allard et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the dispersion of the data points in figure  [ fig4 ] might suggest that there could be a spread in ages among @xmath0  persei members of @xmath1620  myr .",
    "however , this can not be taken at face value because there are several factors producing uncertainties in estimating the ages of individual objects from a color - magnitude or an h - r diagram .",
    "in addition to the sources of dispersion already cited above for the pleiades ( photometric errors and contamination from field stars ) , there could easily be some unresolved binaries .",
    "it is also the case that these young stars are intrinsically variable .",
    "martn & zapatero osorio ( @xcite ) have shown that the vlm @xmath0  per members can have brightness changes of order 0.10.2 mag . in the @xmath17 and @xmath15 filters .",
    "for ap275 they found average magnitudes of @xmath18 in their 1994 data , and @xmath19 in their 1995 data , while prosser ( @xcite ) obtained @xmath20 in his 1991 data .",
    "we have adopted the value of @xmath18 because it is intermediate between the other two and has a lower formal error .",
    "a more precise method of dating vlm cluster members is by ` lithium dating ' ( @xcite ; bildsten et al .",
    "@xcite ; basri @xcite ) .",
    "this exploits the fact that the luminosity at which lithium is efficiently depleted in fully convective objects is a steep function of time and fairly model independent . using analytical calculations , ushomirsky et al .",

    "( @xcite ) and inferred a minimum age of 61@xmath37  myr for the cluster ( if coeval ) from ap279 .",
    "unfortunately , we have found ap279 to have a radial velocity inconsistent with cluster membership .",
    "the next faintest @xmath0  per star with a radial velocity fully consistent with membership and a lithium nondetection is ap275 . using figure  4 of ushomirsky et al .",

    "this age estimate is also quite insensitive to the actual lithium abundance , as demonstrated in equation 40 of ushomirsky et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it does depend on the effective temperature calibration for these pre - main sequence objects , which is still subject to some uncertainty , and on the assumption of evolution at constant effective temperature needed for the analytic analysis .",

    "it is reasonable to use these models because they provide a good fit to the photometric cluster sequence of @xmath0  per members .",
    "a further advantage is that the authors directly provide the theoretical absolute magnitudes in several passbands because they use model atmospheres which provide reasonable good fits to the observed spectra of vlm stars and bds ( allard et al .",

    "the age is unlikely to be lower than 60  myr , and could be as high as 75  myr or more if ap281 is a member ( or if other stars of similar brightness and better pedigree are found not to have lithium )",
    ". in the pleiades cluster lithium dating has led to an age estimate for the members around the substellar limit of 115@xmath310  myr ( @xcite ; martn et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which is about 1.5 times older than the canonical age ( mermilliod @xcite ) .",
    "this is roughly the same effect that we are finding for @xmath0  per . as discussed by @xcite and basri ( @xcite ) ,",
    "this discrepancy can be solved with convective core overshooting in evolutionary models of umst stars .",
    "meynet , mermilliod & maeder ( @xcite ) computed models with moderate overshooting and obtained older ages for the galactic open clusters .",
    "in particular , they found 100  myr for the pleiades and 52  myr for @xmath0  persei .",
    "these ages are more in agreement with the ages inferred from lithium in vlm members than the previous ones obtained without overshooting .",
    "the lithium results actually indicate that the cluster ages are somewhat older than the meynet et al .",
    "( @xcite ) scale , suggesting that stronger overshooting is necessary in their models . on the other hand ,",
    "the overshooting employed by mazzei & pigatto ( @xcite ) was too strong because it yielded a pleiades age of 150  myr .",
    "very recently ventura et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have redone the convective overshoot calculations using the `` full spectrum turbulence '' treatment of canuto , goldman & mazzitelli ( @xcite ) . with approximately the same amount of overshoot as maeder et al .",
    "they find the same ages for the pleiades and @xmath0  per as we do ( presuming ap281 is indeed a member ) . while such good agreement may be fortuitous , it does indicate that the lithium dating technique is robust , and that the source of its disagreement with classical umst ages almost certainly lies in the stellar evolution treatment of high mass stars .    we conclude that the lithium observations of vlm cluster members can provide the best way of empirically calibrating the amount of convective overshooting in high - mass stars , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "obviously we should continue trying to define the lithium boundary in open clusters of various ages to refine these conclusions , and in @xmath0  per itself it is important to locate a number of other stars near the substellar boundary and test them for lithium .",
    "the mass of any vlm cluster member can be estimated from its luminosity , once the cluster age is established ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . with our adopted age of 65  myr ,",
    "the mass of ap275 is a little over 0.1  m@xmath25 , the mass of ap270 is right at the substellar limit of 0.075  m@xmath25 ( 75 jupiters ) , and if ap281 is a member its mass would be around 0.087  m@xmath25 .",
    "if the cluster is yet older , then all 3 objects are stellar . on the other hand , if the age is any less than 65  myr , then ap270 moves more comfortably into the substellar domain .",
    "the boundary of lithium reappearance is not expected to coincide with the substellar boundary in this cluster ; at the bottom right corner of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the depletion line crosses the substellar boundary at about 120  myr ( the age of the pleiades ) .",
    "thus we would expect stars a little brighter than ap270 to also show lithium .",
    "alternatively , if the cluster is 75  myr old then ap270 is itself a star which shows lithium . in any case , ap270 is a benchmark object defining the reappearance of lithium in the @xmath0  persei open cluster .",
    "brown dwarf candidates fainter than ap270 have not been identified yet .",
    "they should be well within the capabilities of present ccd imaging systems on 2  m class telescopes , and we are conducting a program to find them .",
    "the mass estimated from the presence of lithium in ap270 allows us to test the predictions of theoretical evolutionary models at the substellar boundary .",
    "for an age of 65  myr and a mass of 0.075  m@xmath25 , the baraffe models predict absolute magnitudes of m@xmath26=14.55 , m@xmath27=11.50 , and m@xmath28=9.37 ; which can be compared with m@xmath26=15.24 , m@xmath27=11.40 , and m@xmath28=9.25 for ap270 obtained using a distance modulus of 6.33 and an interstellar reddening of a@xmath26=0.3 , e(v - i)=0.16 .",
    "the predicted magnitudes are only 0.1 mag faint in @xmath21 and @xmath7 , but for @xmath29 the predicted magnitude is uncomfortably bright . the use of atmospheric opacities which include the effects of dust may help to reduce the discrepancy in @xmath29 . increasing",
    "the brightness of the models in @xmath15 and @xmath7 would help in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] to reconcile the isochrone age with the lithium age .",
    "this would also help with the problem that the faintest 2 @xmath0  per members appear to be substellar in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , while we have argued above that they are not so low in mass .",
    "the increase needed is 0.3 magnitudes , however .",
    "the burrows models are brighter , but we do not have the specific color predictions which would allow us to make the comparison with our photometry .    a fine analysis of our high - resolution spectra using spectral synthesis should be able to determine the surface lithium abundance of ap270",
    ". the same kind of analysis should provide good estimates of the temperature and gravity of ap270 , which would be very useful for testing evolutionary models .",
    "it would also result in improved estimates of its age and mass .",
    "we are beginning a larger program of fine analysis for several of the currently known bds , using models of allard and hauschildt including the effects of dust .",
