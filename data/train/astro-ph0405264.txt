    "the measurement of the doppler wobble of more than 120 nearby stars induced by the presence of a planetary - mass companion has revealed a population of extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) that is the focus of an increasing fraction of the world s astronomers .",
    "however , due to the fact that for the vast majority of these egps the orbital inclination ( @xmath0 ) is not known , only a lower limit , the projected mass ( sin(i ) ) , constrains the actual planetary mass ( ) . though the orbital distances ( @xmath1 ) , periods ( @xmath2 ) , and eccentricities ( @xmath3 ) are well determined , to study an egp in physical detail requires physical information , such as the actual mass , the radius , and the spectrum .",
    "the detection of planetary transits across the face of the parent star provides the first two of these desiderata and with both masses and radii the structural ( and to some degree compositional ) character of the egp can be studied ( guillot et al .",
    "hd209458b was the first egp to be detected to transit its primary ( henry 2000 ; charbonneau 2000 ) and at a distance of only @xmath447 pc , it is bright enough to yield ( using hst / stis ) a transit light curve with @xmath4100-_micro_magnitude precision ( brown 2001 ) .",
    "proximity also enables precise radial velocity measurements . as a consequence ,",
    "the data for this radial - velocity - selected transiting egp are some of the best we can expect ( brown 2001 ; mazeh 2000 ; cody & sasselov 2002 ) . furthermore",
    ", the overall transit probability for an egp in the doppler surveys is very roughly 0.1 ( fraction close enough ) @xmath5 0.1 ( fraction near @xmath6 inclination ) = 0.01 . since of order",
    "100 egps have been detected , and the doppler surveys of nearby stars are approaching completeness , we ca nt expect too many more like hd209458b .",
    "it is in this context that the photometrically - selected transiting egps ogle - tr-56b ( konacki 2003 ; sasselov 2003 ; torres 2004 ) , ogle - tr-113b ( bouchy 2004 ; konacki 2004 ) , and ogle - tr-132b ( bouchy 2004 ) should be viewed .",
    "the small subset of the stars in the ogle galactic survey that show periodic photometric dips , but that also survive close scrutiny for false positives ( stellar binarity , confusion , etc . ) , has the potential to add considerably to our knowledge of the radius - mass relation for egps .",
    "table 1 gives relevant stellar and planetary data for the known transiting systems , along with associated references .",
    "however , at distances of perhaps 1500 pc , even 8-meter class telescopes ca nt provide the level of doppler precision necessary to compete on a regular basis with that achievable by the ongoing radial - velocity surveys in the solar neighborhood .",
    "moreover , at a distance of @xmath41500 pc , an accurate measurement of the depth of the photometric transit is a major challenge .",
    "nevertheless , the large volume surveyed by the ogle team , and the large volumes that can be surveyed using similar photometric approaches , imply that such programs have the potential to yield a rich harvest of transiting egps .",
    "ground - based photometric transit surveys will pave the way for the more precise space - based surveys to be conducted by kepler ( koch et al .",
    "1998 ) and corot ( antonello & ruiz 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , we can expect in the years to come a large family of egps for which both radii and masses are known and , hence , for which a robust theory of egp radii will be required .",
    "theories for the radius of hd209458b in particular ( burrows 2000 ; hubbard 2001 ; fortney 2003 ; burrows , sudarsky , & hubbard 2003 ; bodenheimer , lin , & mardling 2001 ; bodenheimer , laughlin , & lin 2003 ; guillot & showman 2002 ; showman & guillot 2002 ; allard et al .",
    "2003 ; baraffe 2003 ) and for irradiated egps (  roasters \" ) in general ( guillot 1996 ; burrows , sudarsky , & hubbard 2003 ; baraffe 2003 ; chabrier 2004 ) are appearing that address many of the issues that surround theoretical calculations of the radii of irradiated egps and their evolution . we refer to the discussion in burrows , sudarsky , & hubbard ( 2003 , bsh ) for a critique of the literature and a summary of the various methods .",
    "the apparent anomaly of the ogle transits is the small inferred transit radii in the optical ( table 1 ) , given the larger measured radius for hd209458b . since the orbital distance of ogle - tr-56b in particular is half ( 0.0225 au ) that of hd209458b ( 0.045 au ) , it might have been expected that the greater stellar insolation would have  expanded \" its radius even more than that of hd209458b . to explain the large radius of hd209458b",
    ", a number of theorists have invoked an additional heat / power source in the core , due either to the conversion of a fraction of the intercepted stellar light into deeply - penetrating mechanical waves ( baraffe 2003 ; guillot & showman 2002 ; showman & guillot 2002 ) , or to the presence of an as - yet - unseen companion that induces a slight eccentricity in hd209458b ( bodenheimer , laughlin , & lin 2003 ) .",
    "such an eccentricity can result in tidal heating .",
    "chabrier ( 2004 ) have calculated models for ogle - tr-56b , but have suggested that the injection of added power might be needed to compensate for what would otherwise be a @xmath40.1 km , jupiter s radius ] discrepancy between their determination and the central value of the measured transit radius . however , their numbers do clip the lower end of the error bar range . in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to explain the measured radius of ogle - tr-56b using the tools and approximations described in bsh , without invoking any additional heat source .",
    "we find that the radius of ogle - tr-56b can indeed be fitted comfortably using this theory .    in  [ review ] , we summarize our approximations and approach . in  [ results ] , we present our theoretical results for the evolution with age of the radius ( r@xmath7 ) of the transiting planet ogle - tr-56b and compare theory with observation . in ",
    "[ conclusion ] , we review our conclusions and attempt to put them , as well as our physical theory , into the broader context of the family of irradiated egps , both those that are known and those to be discovered .",
    "we end with a synopsis of the improvements in the theory of irradiated egps that are necessary to make further progress .",
    "the evolution of an egp in isolation requires an outer boundary condition that connects radiative losses , gravity ( @xmath8 ) , and core entropy ( @xmath9 ) . in this case , the radiative losses are given by @xmath10 , where is the effective temperature , r@xmath7 is the planet s radius , and @xmath11 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "when there is no irradiation , the effective temperature determines both the flux from the core and from the entire object . a grid of , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , derived from detailed atmosphere calculations ,",
    "can then be used to evolve the egp ( burrows 1997 ) .",
    "stellar irradiation can drastically alter an egp s atmosphere and the relationship between the core entropy , gravity , and core luminosity .",
    "the latter can be tied to an effective temperature ( ) , but this is now very much lower than the equilibrium temperature ( sudarsky , burrows , and hubeny 2003 ) achieved in the roaster s upper atmosphere .",
    "it is this that determines the rate with which the irradiated planet s core cools ( bsh ) and it is the core entropy that dominates the determination of the radius of a planet of a given mass .",
    "hence , when there is stellar irradiation , gives the flux from the core and determines the inner boundary condition for the atmosphere problem , but does not determine the total emergent flux .",
    "this is given by the sum of the irradiation flux and core flux .",
    "as a result , a more careful atmosphere calculation , one that penetrates deeply into the convective zone to rosseland optical depths of @xmath12 and pressures of @xmath13 bars , is required to establish the boundary conditions necessary for evolutionary calculations of severely irradiated egps .",
    "we use a specific variant of the stellar atmosphere code tlusty ( hubeny 1988 ; hubeny and lanz 1995 ) , called cooltlusty ( briefly described in sudarsky , burrows , hubeny 2003 ) , to calculate t / p profiles and evolutionary boundary conditions for irradiated egps such as ogle - tr-56b , the evolutionary code of burrows ( 1997 ) , the @xmath14 equation of state of saumon , chabrier , & van horn ( 1995 ) , the opacity library described in burrows ( 2001 ) , an updated version of the thermochemical database of burrows & sharp ( 1999 ) , and a stellar spectrum for ogle - tr-56 ( with an assumed spectral type of g2 v ) from kurucz ( 1994 ) .    as bsh",
    "have shown , the transit radius is not the standard  1-bar \" pressure radius ( lindal 1981 ) , nor the  @xmath15 \" photospheric radius .",
    "it is the radius at which the optical depth ( at a given frequency ) along the chord perpendicular to the radius vector is of order unity . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of the photospheric pressure to the  transit pressure \" is near ( @xmath16 r@xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the pressure scale height ( smith & hunten 1990 ) .",
    "this adds @xmath45 pressure scale heights to the @xmath410 pressure scale heights between the canonical photosphere and the radiative / convective boundary .",
    "as found in bsh , the upshot for hd209458b is an increase of @xmath410% in its transit radius . for this paper ,",
    "we have calculated the transit pressure for ogle - tr-56b using the methodology of fortney et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and find an average value in the optical of @xmath420 to 30 millibars for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "this translates into an increase of @xmath43 - 4.5% in the transit radius of the more massive ogle - tr-56b .    to carry out calculations of the evolution of r@xmath7 with age for a given and irradiation regime",
    ", we must assume a helium fraction ( y@xmath21 ) , address the issue of the possible presence of a rocky core , account for variations in the angle of incidence of the stellar radiation across the planet s surface , and address the issue of the difference between the day- and night - side cooling .",
    "for these calculations , we take y@xmath22 .",
    "this is larger than the y@xmath21 expected , but can account for the effect of a rocky core . as shown by bsh for hd209458b , a 10-earth - mass core shrinks the planet by only @xmath43 - 4% .",
    "this is similar to the effect of increasing y@xmath21 by 0.02 . for the more massive ogle - tr-56b ( table 1 ) , the effect of a rocky core is smaller still .",
    "as described in bsh , we have introduced the flux parameter @xmath23 which accounts in approximate fashion for the variation in incident flux with latitude when using a planar atmosphere code .",
    "a value of @xmath24 assumes that there is little sharing of heat between the day and night sides .",
    "a value of @xmath25 assumes that in the calculation of the @xmath26 profile the heat from irradiation is uniformly distributed over the entire sphere . in this paper , we show the results for both assumptions , but favor @xmath25 to approximately account for what may be significant redistribution to the night side .",
    "the issue of the value of @xmath23 is tightly coupled to the day - night cooling difference .",
    "the for the core in each hemisphere depends upon the strong atmospheric circulation currents that advect heat from the day to the night sides ( bsh ; guillot & showman 2002 ; showman & guillot 2002 ; menou 2002 ; cho 2003 ; burkert 2004 ) .",
    "a three - dimensional radiation / hydrodynamic study or global - climate - model ( gcm ) is beyond the scope of this paper . in lieu of that , we assume as in bsh and as do baraffe ( 2003 ) that the flux from the core in both hemispheres is the same .",
    "this does not mean that the @xmath26 profiles are the same at altitude , only that the flux at depth at the radiative / convective boundary is the same .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] depicts evolutionary trajectories of the transit radius r@xmath7 in the optical versus age for the @xmath28 and @xmath29 models of ogle - tr-56b ( gold ) . for both models , y@xmath21 = 0.30 and = 1.45 .",
    "included is the corresponding trajectory for an isolated planet with ogle - tr-56b s characteristics .",
    "irradiation is seen to increase r@xmath7 by @xmath40.2 - 0.3 , depending upon age and @xmath23 .",
    "we have used the theory of fortney ( 2003 ) with our derived @xmath26 and optical depth profiles to calculate a transit pressure level and , hence , the magnitude of the  impact parameter \" that is the transit radius . despite the larger insolation flux , ogle - tr-56b s larger gravity results in a slightly smaller  atmospheric thickness \" effect ( 3 - 4.5% ) than for hd209458b ( @xmath410% ) . superposed on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] are the ogle - tr-56b data from table 1 , where the age of ogle - tr-56b is ascribed to sasselov ( 2003 ) . for comparison ,",
    "[ fig:1 ] includes two representative models ( black ) from bsh for the evolution of hd209458b s transit radius , with y@xmath21 = \\{0.25,0.30 } and @xmath24 .",
    "the age and r@xmath7 estimates for hd208458b listed in table 1 are plotted .",
    "the lowest 1-@xmath11 error bar for hd209458b is from cody & sasselov ( 2002 ) , under the assumption that the lower estimate of the corresponding stellar radius ( @xmath41.1 ) obtains ( bsh ) .    as fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] indicates , our theoretical curves are quite consistent with the ogle - tr-56b data .",
    "the higher @xmath23 gives larger r@xmath7 , but by only 4% after a gigayear ( gyr ) . at a young age of @xmath30 years , r@xmath7 can be near 1.5 , but it is @xmath41.2 - 1.25 after 2 gyrs .",
    "we have calculated trajectories ( not shown ) for the ogle - tr-56b irradiation regime , but for = 1.68 and 1.22 .",
    "after @xmath31 years , they are within less than 1% of that for = 1.45 .",
    "r@xmath7 is a very weak function of planet mass , reflecting the general  @xmath32 \" polytropic character of egps ( burrows 1997 ; burrows et al . 2001 ) .",
    "even if  for ogle - tr-56b were 0.7 , r@xmath7 would be larger by only @xmath40.05 or @xmath40.1 for ages of 3 gyr and 0.1 gyr , respectively . on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the small black arrow on the right indicates the effect of a 10 earth - mass rocky core on models for hd209458b . for ogle - tr-56b , at twice the mass and @xmath42.5 times the gravity",
    ", the arrow would be less than half as long . the weak dependence on age , ,",
    "y@xmath21 , and the possible presence of a rocky core implies that we have in our calculations incorporated the essential physics , chemistry , and radiative effects necessary to explain the transit radius of ogle - tr-56b , without invoking an added power source in the core .",
    "the major effects are the stanching of core cooling ( and the decrease in ) by irradiation s effect on the atmospheric @xmath26 profile ( burrows 2000 ; bsh ) and the 0.04 - 0.05 difference due to the proper definition of the transit radius ( bsh ; baraffe 2003 ) . for ogle - tr-56b",
    ", the pressure at the radiative / convective boundary is between 600 and 900 bars , depending upon true age and @xmath23 .",
    "this is slightly lower than that for hd209458b , reflecting the larger mass .",
    "the rate with which the radiative front is now penetrating ogle - tr-56b is @xmath4200 bars per gyr , equivalent to a scant @xmath33 per gyr .",
    "we have shown that our theory , which couples spectral , atmospheric , and evolutionary calculations in a straightforward manner , can explain the measured transit radius of ogle - tr-56b .",
    "our calculations yield values for r@xmath7 that are @xmath40.1 higher than those of chabrier ( 2004 ) , which without an extra heat source undershoot by @xmath410% the central value of the ogle - tr-56b r@xmath7 measurement .",
    "since they are using a similarly sophisticated approach , the source of this difference is unknown .",
    "the larger radius of hd209458b is still problematic , but even it can be fitted without an ad hoc extra power source , if its true transit radius is at the lower end of the measured range ( bsh ) .",
    "it is important to remember that systematic errors still dominate estimates of r@xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , not only is ogle - tr-56b smaller than hd209458b , but so too seem ogle-113b and ogle-132b ( however , note the large error bars in table 1 ) .",
    "curiously , all the ogle roasters have smaller orbital distances .",
    "this implies that hd209458b is the anomaly , perhaps due to tidal heating caused by an as - yet - unseen second companion ( bodenheimer , laughlin , & lin 2003 ) or to residual systematic errors .",
    "hence , a compelling argument can be made that the transit radii of all the ogle egps are consistent with a model that does not require any extra heating term beyond that supplied quite naturally through the standard effects of irradiation and radiative transfer into the convective core .",
    "the remaining theoretical uncertainties are the actual day - night cooling differences , the 3d effects of atmospheric circulation and zonal heat transport , and the early history of the planet .",
    "as shown by burrows ( 2000 ) , and as is implied on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , if the egp were born at large orbital distances , but took more than @xmath34 years to migrate in to its present distance , then its radius would have shrunk below a value consistent with the measured r@xmath7 ( for any of the objects listed in table 1 ) .",
    "one could then accommodate an extra heat source , since it would be needed to compensate for the early loss of core entropy .",
    "however , such a migration time is deemed rather long , and we prefer to shave with occam s razor .",
