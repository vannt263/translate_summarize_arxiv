    "modern quantum field theories are based on fundamental symmetries .",
    "this holds for quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) as well as for the standard model of elementary particle physics . whenever physicists talk about symmetries they usually think of gauge invariance or the discrete symmetries charge conjugation _ c _ , parity _ p _ , and time reversal _ t_. however , there is one symmetry that often takes a back seat : lorentz invariance .",
    "this is not surprising , since until now there had been no convincing experimental evidence for a violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "however , a violation of other symmetries is part of the everyday life of any high - energy physicist .",
    "for example , violations of _ p _ and _ cp _ were measured long ago @xcite and a broken electroweak gauge symmetry with massive @xmath0 , and @xmath1 bosons is an experimental fact .",
    "why then should lorentz symmetry and its violation not be of interest ?    there exist good theoretical arguments for lorentz invariance being a symmetry that is restored at low energies @xcite . at the planck length",
    "the topology of spacetime may be dynamical , which could lead to it having a foamy structure .",
    "the existence of such a spacetime foam @xcite may define a preferred reference frame  as is the case for water in a glass  and thus violate lorentz invariance .",
    "since a fundamental quantum theory of spacetime is still not known , we have to rely on well - established theories such as the standard model or special relativity for a description of lorentz violation . by introducing new parameters that deform these theories it is possible to parameterize lorentz violation on the basis of standard physics .",
    "one approach is to modify dispersion relations of particles .",
    "however , such a procedure is very _ ad hoc _ and it is not evident where the modification comes from .",
    "therefore , a more elementary possibility is to parameterize modifications on the level of lagrange densities .",
    "a collection of all lorentz - violating deformations of the standard model that are gauge invariant is known as the lorentz - violating extension of the standard model @xcite .",
    "the minimal version of this extension relies on power - counting renormalizable terms , whereas the nonminimal version also includes operators of mass dimension @xmath2 ( see e.g. the analyses performed in @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical consistency of the standard model itself has been verified by investigations based on lorentz - invariant quantum field theory that were performed over decades ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , it is not entirely clear if a lorentz - violating theory is consistent .",
    "some results on certain sectors of the standard model extension already exist @xcite , but there still remains a lot what we can learn about lorentz - violating quantum field theories . because of this it is very important to check lorentz - violating deformations with respect to fundamental properties such as microcausality and unitarity .",
    "furthermore , it is of significance whether the modified theory approaches the standard theory for arbitrarily small deformations . the purpose of this paper is to investigate these questions .    especially in the case where lorentz violation resides in the photon sector",
    ", it can lead to a variety of new effects , for example a birefringent vacuum @xcite , new particle decays @xcite , and `` aetherlike '' deviations from special relativity , which are modulated with the rotation of the earth around the sun ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . from an experimental point of view",
    ", photons produce clean signals making the photon sector very important , in bounding lorentz - violating parameters .",
    "there exist two gauge - invariant and power - counting renormalizable deformations of the photon sector : maxwell  chern  simons theory ( mcs - theory ) @xcite and modified maxwell theory @xcite .",
    "each lagrangian contains additional terms besides the maxwell term of standard electrodynamics .",
    "the consistency of the isotropic and one anisotropic sector of modified maxwell theory was already shown in @xcite . in this article a special sector , that violates parity and is supposed to show no birefringence , will be investigated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 modified maxwell theory is presented and restricted to the parity - odd nonbirefringent case .",
    "additionally , it is coupled to a standard dirac theory of massive spin-1/2 fermions , which leads to a theory of modified qed . in secs . 3 and 4 , we review the nonstandard photon dispersion relations and the gauge propagator , which are determined from the field equations @xcite .",
    "that completes the current status of research concerning this special sector of modified maxwell theory .",
    "the successive parts of the article deal with the main issue , beginning with the deformed polarization vectors , which can also be obtained from the field equations . after setting up the building blocks we are ready to discuss unitarity in sec . 6 and microcausality in sec .",
    "the subsequent two sections are devoted to the polarization vectors themselves . since their form is rather uncommon",
    " even when considering lorentz - violating theories  we make comparisons with mcs - theory and other sectors of modified maxwell theory .",
    "it will become evident that the polarization vectors have a property that distinguishes them from the polarization vectors of standard electrodynamics , even in the limit of vanishing lorentz violation .",
    "to test , whether or not some residue of the deformation remains in this limit , in sec .",
    "9 we compute the cross section of the simplest tree - level process involving external modified photons that is also allowed by standard qed : compton scattering .",
