    "statistical correlation and shannon information entropies in both the position and momentum spaces are the key quantities in the understanding of quantum mechanical systems which measure information regarding localisation of the position and momentum distribution . an important step in this direction is the entropic uncertainty relation ( eur ) . using the position and momentum space entropies ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively ) , bialynicki - birula and mycielski ( bbm ) derived a stronger version of the heisenberg uncertainty relation  @xcite . for a three - dimensional system",
    "the total entropic sum has the form @xmath3 this means that the conjugate position and momentum space information entropies @xmath0 and @xmath1 maintain an inverse relationship with each other .",
    "it signifies that when a system is strongly localised in position space , the corresponding information entropy and uncertainty in position space decrease .",
    "the corresponding momentum distribution becomes delocalised , i.e. the information entropy and uncertainty in momentum space increase .",
    "it is important to note that bbm inequality  ( eq.(1 ) ) presents a lower bound and the equality is maintained for a gaussian wave function .    in the past",
    ", work has been devoted to the study of the shannon entropies in various quantum mechanical systems like nuclei , atomic clusters , fermionic and bosonic systems  @xcite .",
    "the universal property of total entropy @xmath4 for the total density distribution in different quantum systems is proposed which takes the form  @xcite @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the parameters which depend on the given systems .",
    "information theory in a system of correlated bosons in a trap and various features of information entropy of different atomic systems are well studied  @xcite .",
    "entanglement which is a central issue in quantum information theory has also been studied in different context  @xcite .",
    "shannon entropy has also been interpreted as a measure of electron correlation which is directly related to the strength of the interaction between the electrons  @xcite . in our present study",
    "we consider interacting trapped bosons in external confinement at zero temperature .",
    "the gas is considered to be extremely dilute as the inter - atomic separation is quite large compared to the range of interatomic interaction and the fundamental features of such trapped bosons are accurately described by a single parameter @xmath8 , the @xmath9-wave scattering length .",
    "this is quite different from the dipolar bosons for which interaction potential includes long - range anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction ( in addition to the short - range @xmath10 interaction ) which has significant effect on the phase transition of the dipolar bec in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "the choice of our system is quite similar to that of earlier studies  @xcite , however the motivation of our present work is quite different , as follows .",
    "first : we are interested in the study of dynamics of shannon entropies and the eur in a fixed confinement but with a varying effective interaction @xmath11 . for weakly interacting large number of bosons in the external confinement , the ground state properties",
    "are quite accurately explained by the nonlinear equation , known as time - independent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath12\\psi(\\vec{r } ) = \\mu \\psi(\\vec{r})\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the interaction strength parameter given by @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the number of atoms , @xmath16 is the atomic mass , @xmath8 is the dimer scattering length , and @xmath17 is the trap frequency . in the earlier works in this direction , eq .",
    "( 3 ) has been solved and the eur is tested for various number of atoms  @xcite .",
    "however in the earlier study the effect of nonlinearity in the dynamical feature of information entropies is not focussed . for",
    "this one should solve the time - dependent gp equation and using the dynamics of the many - boson wave function one can directly observe the effect of nonlinearity in the time evolution of information entropy and the eur .",
    "although the nonlinear effect in the time evolution of the condensate has been studied earlier  @xcite , the dynamics of information entropy and the validity of the eur with evolution in time is a stronger tool to manifest the effect of nonlinearity and it deserves special interest .",
    "second : we study the dynamics of information entropies in very tight trap . in the present day experiment , by controlling the external magnetic field",
    ", one can virtually manipulate the external trap size . in very tight trap ,",
    "the atoms will be highly correlated and strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "the calculation of shannon entropies will be very informative to describe such a highly localised and strongly inhomogeneous system .",
    "the study of dynamical features of information entropies and the dynamics of eur will give rich physics .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "ii deals with the brief review of time dependent gp equation and calculation of dynamics of shannon entropies . sec .",
    "iii deals with our results . here",
    "we analyze the dynamics of eur in different trap sizes for various interaction strength parameters  @xmath13 .",
    "we also present our calculated values of landsberg s order parameter @xmath18 for various interaction strength parameters  @xmath13 at time @xmath19 .",
    "iv concludes with summary .",
    "we start with the zero temperature condensate in the harmonic trap described by the time dependent gross - pitaevskii equation as @xmath20\\psi({\\vec{r}},t ) , \\ ] ] to solve eq .",
    "( 4 ) we start with the analytic and normalized ground state solution in the absence of the nonlinear term and propagate the gp equation with time .",
    "the numerical integration of the time - dependent gp is obtained by using a finite - difference crank - nicolson algorithm with a split operator technique  @xcite .",
    "we have verified that the numerical solution of gp equation is consistent with various sets of radial grids and time steps . in the time - dependent solution",
    "although the probability is time independent , i.e stationary in time , the condensate wave function has time dependent phase factor as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the energy in oscillator unit .",
    "thus the effect of perturbation comes through the nonlinear term which involves the time dependent wave function in the previous time step and allows us to monitor the condensate motion with time .",
    "+ next we calculate the time - dependent momentum space wave function @xmath23 by taking fourier transformation of the time - dependent position space wave function @xmath24 at each time step as @xmath25 here @xmath24 is the normalized ground state solution of eq .",
    "( 4 ) and is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the radial part of the wave function .",
    "the angular part of the ground state solution is a constant and is taken care by the constant pre - factor along with the normalization .",
    "now due to the presence of spherically symmetric trap , all directions are equivalent and we set the polar axis of the spherical polar coordinate along the direction of @xmath28 . then performing the integrals over the angular coordinates first , the @xmath29 integral of eq .  ( 5 ) simplifies to an integration over the radial coordinate only .",
    "@xmath30 here @xmath31 is the magnitude of @xmath28 .",
    "we perform this integral over @xmath32 by using a 32-point gaussian quadrature .",
    "we truncate the sum at @xmath33 which is detrmined from the asymptotic behavior and normalization of @xmath27 .    for a three - dimensional system",
    "the information entropy in the position space is calculated from the density distribution @xmath34 = @xmath35 as @xmath36 the corresponding information entropy in the momentum space is determined from the momentum distribution @xmath37= @xmath38 as @xmath39 if @xmath34 and @xmath37 are normalized to unity , the joint entropy at time @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 . at @xmath19 as there is no effect of nonlinear terms , @xmath42 should obey the existing entropic uncertainity relation ( eur )  @xcite given as @xmath43 it is already pointed out in the study of different quantum systems that the eur is stronger than the heisenberg s uncertainity relation due to the following reasons  @xcite .",
    "first : heisenberg s relation can be derived from the eur but its reverse is not true .",
    "second : heisenberg s relation depends on the state of the system but the eur does not  @xcite .",
    "although eq .",
    "( 5 ) - ( 9 ) have been used earlier in the study of interacting bosonic systems , however it needs additional discussion regarding the validity of the expression for a condensate having finite size .",
    "although eq .",
    "( 7 ) and eq .",
    "( 8) are apparently valid for single particle only , however its extension and use for the condensate is equally valid . above the critical temperature @xmath44",
    "although there is a contribution coming from non - condensed atoms , but at the critical temperature @xmath44 ( @xmath45 nk ) there is a macroscopic occupation of the bosons . at such low temperature , the de broglie",
    "wave - lengths of the neighbouring atoms overlap , the individual atoms lose their quantum identity .",
    "thus the whole bosonic cloud is treated as a single quantum stuff which is well described by the zero - temperature gp equation .",
    "this is also in perfect agreement with the framework of generalized bogoliubov prescription , where the condensate wave function is the expectation value of the field operator .",
    "thus the fluctuation in field operator is neglected .",
    "this is quite justified as the depletion of the condensate at the the temperature @xmath45 nk is negligible .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( 7 ) and eq .",
    "( 8) basically determines the information entropy associated with the whole condensate and not of individual bosons .",
    "we consider the condensate of @xmath46rb atoms with @xmath8 = 100 @xmath47 and initially choose the trap frequency @xmath17 as 77.87 hz which mimics the jila experiment  @xcite . with these parameters",
    "we solve numerically eq .  ( 4 ) for various number of bosons in the trap .",
    "we calculate the condensate wave function in the coordinate space with varying nonlinearity @xmath13 . in this work",
    "we express all the quantities in oscillator unit ( o.u . ) . in oscillator units ( o.u . )",
    "all lengths are expressed in units of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) and all energies in units of @xmath50 , @xmath17 being the trap frequency . since the oscillator units ( o.u . ) are frequency dependent , for our present work we define them ( _ i.e. _ @xmath48 and @xmath50 ) with respect to the frequency @xmath51 ( = 77.87 hz ) of the jila trap  @xcite . first to check the consistency of our results with earlier published results  @xcite , we solve the time - independent gp equation ( eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) with varying number of bosons @xmath15 ( or equivalently with varying strength of interatomic interaction @xmath13 ) for pure harmonic trap . in fig .",
    "1(a ) we plot the condensate wave functions @xmath52 for various number of atoms in the trap . for a fixed external trap",
    "the wave function @xmath52 gradually expands with increase in number of bosons as the strength of repulsive interaction @xmath13 ( = @xmath53 ) increases with increase in @xmath15 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in ordinary thermodynamics , entropy is a measure of disorder in the system .",
    "however , defining disorder @xmath54 as @xmath55 , where @xmath4 and @xmath56 refer to the same equation of state , landsberg defined a order parameter @xmath18  @xcite by @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath18 = 1 corresponds to perfect order and @xmath18 = 0 corresponds to randomness .",
    "it has been shown by a whole class of examples that the entropy @xmath4 and the order parameter @xmath18 are two decoupled concepts  @xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we have also calculated the landsberg s order parameter @xmath18 at @xmath19 . in table",
    "@xmath58 we present the values of @xmath18 for various nonlinearities .",
    "10 & @xmath59 + 100 & @xmath60 + 500 & @xmath61 +    it implies that by increasing the number of particles , the system becomes more ordered .",
    "this observation agrees well with earlier observation in atoms and clusters  @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the entropy and order are decoupled unlike the case in thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "lastly our calculated values can be correlated with the experimental observation . as stated earlier",
    "that the most relevant feature of trapped bose gas is that they are inhomogeneous due to external trapping potential .",
    "the important consequense is bec shows up not only in momentum space like noninteracting homogeneous ideal bose gas , but also in coordinate space  @xcite .",
    "this dual possibility of investigating the effects of trapped condensation and associated measurement of both the density and velocity distribution are very interesting and novel .",
    "the density distribution of the atoms in the trap as a function of coordinate is measured by the optical method  @xcite .",
    "it also provides the measurement of size of the cloud . whereas other kind of distribution is the velocity distribution in momentum space which is measured by time - of - flight measurements .",
    "the atoms were left to expand by switching off the confining trap and the velocity distribution is imaged .",
    "thus the dual possibility to obtain the density distribution corresponds to the fourier transformation of the condensate wave function in the momentum space . as the density in coordinate and momentum space are the basic ingredients to calculate the shannon information entropy , our theoretical results can be correlated with the experimental observation .",
    "this is also nicely demonstrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , where the opposite diverging behavior in @xmath62 and @xmath63 nicely demonstrate the experimentally observed critical point of stability .",
    "again the maximum value of information entropy can be accurately determined from eq .  ( 11 ) where the size of the condensate @xmath64 and the kinetic energy of the system are known from the experimental results .",
    "thus our theoretical results provide rich physics which can be tested in modern experiments .",
    "another relevant question is how to correlate the theoretical @xmath65 temperature results with those of experimentally measurable quantities which would be for @xmath66 . in the real experimental situation",
    "the condensate temperature is @xmath45 nk as said earlier .",
    "thus in the presence of thermal cloud , there is an interaction between the condensate and non - condensed atoms and thermal fluctuation also plays an important role .",
    "however in the present study we consider the @xmath67 but @xmath68 ( @xmath44 being the critical temperature ) where there is a macroscopic population in the single lowest quantum state , i.e. the condensate is absolutely formed and there is no thermal fluctuation .",
    "thus our system does not have thermally excited atoms .",
    "apparently it may contradict the experimental situation , however in the presence of external trap as the interaction energy is very small compared to the trap energy , one can safely use the zero - temperature gp equation in the description of condensate .",
    "however when @xmath69 , there will be thermal distribution of atoms in the higher states , the ground state is depleted and to study such system we must use temperature dependent formalism .",
    "thus our @xmath65 temperature results are particularly valid in the length scales from the interparticle distance to the healing length which is the relevant range in current experiments where @xmath70 .",
    "shannon entropies are generally used to examine the localisation of the distribution function in the position and momentum space . in the present paper the dynamics of information entropies and the eur",
    "are studied with varying interparticle potential of the interacting trapped bosons and varying trap width .",
    "the system draws special attention due to the presence of external trap .",
    "we observed that for weak interaction ( i.e small @xmath13 ) the system shows periodic behavior irrespective of trap widths .",
    "however with increasing interaction strength @xmath13 , irregular behavior comes in and also the effect of varying trap width becomes more pronounced .",
    "we stress that since we choose the parameters like @xmath51 , @xmath8 etc .",
    "as those of jila experiment and also restricted @xmath15 up to few thousands only , gp equation is good enough to describe it . for more dense system with stronger interaction strength ( i.e. larger @xmath15 and @xmath8 )",
    "inter - atomic correlations become important .",
    "so some other theoretical technique incorporating correlations needs to be applied .",
    "another important observation is that the eur is maintained throughout time for all cases and thereby reaffirms its generality as an earlier study has verified it numerically for different number of bosons in the trap .",
    "the increase of @xmath18 with @xmath13 ( i.e. n , as we kept @xmath8 fixed ) is consistent with earlier study and confirms again that the entropy and order are decoupled .",
    "however the dynamic evolution of @xmath18 with time for various @xmath13 remains to be studied .",
    "also another possible extension of our present work is to study the dipolar bec . as mentioned earlier the interaction potential for dipolar bosons",
    "consists of two parts - the long - range anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction and the short - range @xmath10 potential characterized by the @xmath9 wave scattering length @xmath8 . in recent experiments",
    "@xmath9 wave interaction has been tuned keeping the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction fixed .",
    "it would be interesting to study its effect on the quantum properties of such dipolar bec .",
    "finally as described earlier , all our results are directly related to the experimentally measurable quantities and therefore they are experimentally accessible even with available set up .",
