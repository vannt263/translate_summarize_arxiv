    "in a companion paper ( balcells , graham , & peletier 2007 , hereafter paper  iii ) , we present high - resolution near - infrared ( nir ) surface brightness profiles of early- to intermediate - type disk galaxies .",
    "these are derived from _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) nicmos images and extended with nir ground - based profiles from ukirt images . that paper provides profile decompositions into bulge , disk , and nuclear components , and analyzes the nuclear properties of the bulges .",
    "in the present paper , we use the profile decompositions of paper  iii to analyze the global scaling relations for bulges and disks , free from the biasing influence of additional nuclear components .",
    "global scaling relations provide useful diagnostics on the structure of disk galaxies . for bulge components ,",
    "comparison with the scaling relations of elliptical galaxies shows to what degree bulges are either similar or different to ellipticals .",
    "whether bulges resemble spheroids or disks is still an open question ( wyse , gilmore , & franx 1997 ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) . to give one example of the complexity of this issue ,",
    "some apparent bulges in face - on , barred s0 galaxies are in fact inner disks ( kormendy 1993 ; erwin et al .",
    "2003 ) , which of course has implications for galaxy formation models . for both bulges and the outer , large - scale disks",
    ", the scaling relations may provide clues on the long - standing question of the origin of the hubble sequence .",
    "the sample of de jong & van der kruit ( 1994 ) has provided a useful reference for intermediate- to late - type field disk galaxies , and its scaling relations have been analyzed by de jong ( 1996 ) and courteau , de jong , & broeils ( 1996 ) .",
    "graham ( 2001 , hereafter g01 ) and macarthur , courteau , & holtzman ( 2003 ) provide a more recent study of intermediate- to late - type spirals , using srsic fits for the bulge .",
    "hunt , pierini , & giovanardi ( 2003 , hereafter hpg03 ) have also analyzed bulge and disk scaling relations from a sample of disk galaxies in the perseus - pisces supercluster ; their sample comprises mostly sb and later - type spirals . at the other end of the hubble sequence ,",
    "s0 galaxies are often discussed together with ellipticals , but are rarely compared to spiral galaxies .",
    "the study presented in this paper is complementary to the ones above as it samples early- to intermediate - type , s0 through sbc , disk galaxies .",
    "moreover , the analysis presented here uses  images to subtract the flux of additional nuclear components such as star clusters and nuclear disks , which have biased previous studies of bulge , and hence disk , parameters .",
    "this is perhaps best evidenced through the reporting of 14-like bulges with srsic indices @xmath2 when using low - resolution ground - based data which smear out the flux from the unresolved nuclear components ( e.g. , andredakis , peletier , & balcells 1995 , hereafter apb95 ) .",
    "higher - resolution studies with  have since revealed that the majority of such galaxies have noticeably less concentrated bulges , with @xmath3 , but clear additional components ( balcells et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter paper  ii ; paper  iii ) .",
    "bulge and disk scaling relations have traditionally been studied as a function of hubble type , commonly parametrized with the revised type index t ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 , hereafter rc3 ) . the lack of a correlation between the ratio of the bulge effective radius @xmath4 and the disk scale length @xmath5 with hubble type , led to the statement that the spiral hubble sequence is scale - free ( de jong 1996 ; courteau et al .",
    "1996 ) . in a scale - free situation , an ice - berg model ,",
    "in which bulge surface brightness rather than effective radius determines how much the bulge protrudes above the disk , might explain the higher prominence of earlier - type bulges ( g01 ) .",
    "that the hubble sequence is scale - free has implications for bulge formation models , as secular evolution models ( pfenniger & norman 1990 ; norman , sellwood , & hasan 1996 ) predict that bulge and disk scale lengths are correlated ( combes et al .  1990 ) .",
    "the parameters used for the scaling relations , derived from nir images , are less affected by dust extinction than those derived from optical images .",
    "furthermore , @xmath6 variations with population age and metallicity are small in the nir , yielding small differences between the photometric length - scales and the stellar - mass scales of the galaxies .",
    "we will show that bulge luminosity is indeed a key yardstick that traces the values of bulge , disk , and global galaxy parameters .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the sample and the profile decomposition .",
    "section  [ sec : completeness ] discusses selection biases and provides a volume correction .",
    "the main results of the paper are contained in figures [ fig : bdparmk ] , [ fig : bdpardismk ] , [ fig : bdparsig ] , and [ fig : bdpart ] , and analyzed in section  [ sec : globalparameters ] , for bulges (  [ sec : bulgeparameters ] ) , disks (  [ sec : diskparameters ] ) , and bulge - to - disk scaling relations (  [ sec : bdscaling ] ) .",
    "we discuss two specific issues in section  [ sec : discussion ] : the trends of the galaxy central surface brightness with spheroid luminosity (  [ sec : discussionmu0 ] ) , and the scale - free nature of the hubble sequence (  [ sec : discussionhubblesequence ] ) .",
    "a hubble constant of @xmath7 kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 is used throughout .",
    "the galaxy sample is described in detail in paper  iii .",
    "it comprises 19 galaxies of types s0-sbc extracted from the diameter - limited sample of inclined galaxies of balcells & peletier ( 1994 ) .",
    "the diameter limit puts the selected galaxy diameters in the broad range 15 kpc to 80 kpc .",
    "the selection excluded very dusty bulges , so the sample has a slight bias toward quiescent bulges .",
    "basic properties of the sample are listed in table1 of paper  iii .",
    "the 19 galaxies were observed with nicmos on   through the f160w filter .",
    "data reduction is described in peletier et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "the derivation of surface brightness profiles is described in paper  iii .",
    "@xmath9-band surface brightness profiles obtained from ukirt images ( apb95 ; peletier & balcells 1997 ) were scaled to the @xmath10-band and linked smoothly to the   profiles , yielding surface brightness profiles which span from @xmath120 pc to several kpc , thus covering the nucleus , bulge , and disk - dominated region of each galaxy .",
    "we performed a one - dimensional profile decomposition using an exponential model for the disk and srsic ( 1963 ) model ( graham & driver 2005 ) for the bulge ,    @xmath11    where @xmath4 encloses half the model light , @xmath12 measures the curvature of the profile , and @xmath13 .",
    "the decomposition is described in detail in papers  ii and iii . due to the presence of positive nuclear residuals in some galaxies , unresolved ( ps ) or resolved ( exponential ) components were added to the fitting function .",
    "the properties of these nuclear components are analyzed in paper  iii , which also shows the profiles , the fits , and lists the best - fit parameters ( tables24 of that paper ) .",
    "those parameters provide the basis for the analysis of the scaling relations presented here .",
    "our analysis ignores galaxian sub - components that may be found outside the bulges , such as rings and lenses ( prieto et al .",
    "we also ignore bar components .",
    "our sample selection took galaxies listed as unbarred , although the presence of bars in some of the more edge - on cases can not be ruled out .",
    "given the small sample size ( @xmath14 ) and the various selection processes involved , we have checked to what degree our sample is a fair representation of the local s0-sbc galaxy population .",
    "we follow the standard @xmath15  formalism developed by thuan & seitzer ( 1977 ) .",
    "briefly , for a diameter - limited sample , under the assumption that surface brightness is independent of distance , a galaxy s angular diameter @xmath16 is inversely proportional to its distance , and it is straightforward to compute the maximum distance @xmath17 at which the galaxy would still be included in a sample limited by @xmath18 , with @xmath19 in our case .",
    "we then compute the volume @xmath20 of a sphere of radius equal to the distance @xmath21 to the galaxy , and the volume @xmath22 of the sphere out to @xmath17 .",
    "the ratio of volumes is @xmath15  @xmath23 . for objects randomly distributed in space , @xmath15",
    "should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 , with a mean @xmath24  @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of objects .    for the original sample selected in balcells & peletier ( 1994 ) , comprising 43 objects , the ugc red diameters yield @xmath24  @xmath27 ,",
    "hence that sample is statistically complete .",
    "the sample of 19 objects imaged with   has @xmath24  @xmath28 .",
    "this shows that the  sample is mildly biased toward nearby objects ; this reflects the selection of targets for   imaging , which , other things being equal , favored high spatial resolution .",
    "the bias introduced is small , in any case .    by weighting each galaxy by @xmath29 ,",
    "our diameter - limited sample mimics a volume - limited sample .",
    "the weighting is essential whenever mean values or volume - related quantities are sought ; we have also explored its use when computing scaling relations between various galaxy parameters , see  [ sec : globalparameters ] .",
    "@xmath22  is given by    @xmath30    the distribution of @xmath29  with bulge @xmath9-band absolute magnitude will be shown in figure[fig : bdparmk]j .",
    "this section presents global scaling relations inferred from the bulge - disk decompositions .",
    "galaxy parameters are corrected for foreground galactic extinction ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) , @xmath31 cosmological dimming , and @xmath9-correction ( poggianti 1997 ) .",
    "the disk parameters have been corrected to a face - on aspect , assuming transparent disks .",
    "the corrected parameters are listed in table  3 of paper  iii .",
    "figures[fig : bdparmk][fig : bdpart ] display the dependencies of global parameters on bulge absolute magnitude , disk absolute magnitude , central velocity dispersion , and galaxy hubble type , respectively .",
    "strong correlations with bulge absolute magnitude are generally found , with one single deviant point at the faint end .",
    "this corresponds to ngc  5577 ( sbc ) , and we exclude this galaxy from the regression analysis in order not to bias the global trends .",
    "we computed the scaling relations via unweighted orthogonal regressions , following the algorithm of york ( 1966 ) .",
    "we explored weighted orthogonal regressions using @xmath29  weights : resulting fitting coefficients changed by typically @xmath110% , but a few of the weighted regressions failed to converge , hence , for the sake of a uniform treatment , the parameters presented in the following subsections are those of the unweighted regressions . for each correlation",
    "we list the spearman rank - order correlation coefficient ( @xmath32 ) and the probability of a null correlation ( ) .",
    "bulge effective radii ( fig.[fig : bdparmk]a ) range from 0.1 to 1 kpc .",
    "they increase with bulge luminosity , as found for ellipticals ( e.g.  hubble 1926 ; binggeli , sandage , & tarenghi 1984 , hereafter vcc ) .",
    "an orthogonal regression to the @xmath4@xmath33 relation gives ( allen 1973 ) ]    @xmath34    ( @xmath35 ;  @xmath36 ) .",
    "a strong correlation exists also between @xmath4 and bulge central velocity dispersion ( fig.[fig : bdparsig]a ; @xmath37 ;  @xmath38 ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath4 shows no dependence on t ( fig.[fig : bdpart]a ; @xmath39 ;  @xmath40 ) .",
    "both of these results are similar to those of hpg03 .",
    "the correlation of @xmath4 with _ disk _",
    "absolute magnitude is also null ( fig.[fig : bdpardismk]a ; @xmath41 ;  @xmath42 ) .",
    "mllenhoff & heidt ( 2001 ) report @xmath43 for their bulge sample .",
    "part of the difference between the exponents appears to be due to the type of regression performed , as an _ orthogonal _ regression to their @xmath9-band data yields @xmath44 , i.e. , at 2-@xmath45 from our result .",
    "our two samples cover similar bulge luminosity ranges , but their @xmath4 go up to 10 kpc for the largest bulges .",
    "their fits , using ground - based data , include any nuclear components as part of the bulge .",
    "given the 90% detection frequency of nuclear components in our sample , such components are likely to be present in their galaxies , which may boost srsic indices up to @xmath46 ( paperii ) ; and such biases yield higher values of @xmath4 .    for elliptical galaxies , vcc show that the @xmath47 relation has @xmath48 for low - luminosity ellipticals ( @xmath49 ) , and @xmath50 for giant ellipticals ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "our bulges have absolute blue magnitudes in the range @xmath52 . for our bulges ( peletier & balcells 1997 ) . ] over that range , the @xmath53 relation for vcc ellipticals is approximately @xmath54 . comparing with eqn.[eqn : remk ] , we conclude that the size  luminosity relations for bulges has similar slope to that of ellipticals of the same luminosity .",
    "the mean effective surface brightness is readily obtained from @xmath4 as @xmath55  = @xmath56 , where @xmath9 is the total apparent @xmath9-band magnitude of the bulge .",
    "vcc showed that , for faint ellipticals , @xmath55  becomes brighter with luminosity , while it becomes fainter with increasing luminosity for giants . for bulges",
    ", the @xmath53 relation ( eqn.[eqn : remk ] ) indicates that @xmath55  brightens with bulge luminosity over the bulges luminosity range .",

    "the effective surface brightness , @xmath58 , is shown against @xmath9-band absolute bulge magnitude in figure[fig : bdparmk]b .",
    "an orthogonal regression gives    @xmath59    ( @xmath60 ;  @xmath61 ) .",
    "here and in following subsections , @xmath9-band surface brightness are derived from @xmath10-band values using @xmath62 .",
    "the distribution is nearly flat , as are the trends of @xmath63 with the disk luminosity  ( fig.[fig : bdpardismk]b ; @xmath64 ;  @xmath65 ) , with @xmath66 ( fig.[fig : bdparsig]b ; @xmath67 ;  @xmath68 ) , and with t ( fig.[fig : bdpart]b ; @xmath69 ;  @xmath70 ) .",
    "of key interest are the trends of central surface brightness with luminosity . if bulge surface brightness profiles were homologous , i.e. , if they had the same profile shapes , the trends found in ",
    "[ sec : mueff ] for @xmath55  and @xmath71 would imply central densities nearly independent of luminosity .",
    "however , bulge profiles are not homologous , and , hence , peak surface brightness needs to be measured closer to the centers ( binggeli & cameron 1991 ) .    even with the high spatial resolution of the , the various approaches that may be envisaged to define and measure central surface brightness lead to different results .",
    "each approach has its own merits .",
    "one measure is provided by the inwardly - extrapolated central value of the bulge srsic profile , .",
    "using an extrapolated central value is common practice for exponential and other profile models that have finite central density , and so we use this approach for our srsic spheroids . as compared to a direct reading of the @xmath72 profile ,  avoids the biases introduced by additional components present in the galaxy nuclei ( paper  iii ) , and hence may be seen as a more accurate estimate of the central surface brightness of the bulge component .",
    "we will show here that  shows a strong , monotonic trend with luminosity for bulges , as previously known for dwarf and giant ellipticals .",
    "figure[fig : bdparmk]c shows @xmath73 against the bulge absolute magnitude .",
    "the distribution shows that the central surface brightness of bulges is a steep function of luminosity ( compare to fig.[fig : bdparmk]b ) . after offsetting  ( @xmath10-band ) to the @xmath9-band with @xmath74 , an orthogonal regression to the data points gives    @xmath75    ( @xmath76 ;  @xmath77 ) .",
    "the relation is close to the maximum slope that is compatible with an increase of  with spheroid luminosity ( given @xmath78 ) .",
    "there is no sign of a turn - over at high luminosities . indeed , if @xmath12 increases with luminosity , then the _ effective _ surface brightness turn - over at bright magnitudes does not imply a turn - over of _ central _ surface brightness ( binggeli & jerjen 1998 ; graham & guzmn 2003 ) .",
    "rather , @xmath79 continues to rise with luminosity due to the higher @xmath12 from higher luminosity spheroids .",
    "the dependence of @xmath80 on t is not significant ( figure[fig : bdpart]c ;  @xmath81 ) , indicating that hubble type index does not determine central galaxy density .",
    "similarly ,  does not correlate with the disk luminosity ( figure[fig : bdpardismk]c ;  @xmath82 ) .    in figure[fig : mu0mb]a we plot the srsic - extrapolated central surface brightness  of our bulges against absolute magnitude , together with ellipticals from caon et al .  ( 1993 ) and dwarf ellipticals from binggeli & jerjen ( 1998 ) and graham & guzmn ( 2003 ) .",
    "the values of  from bulges follows a general trend of brighter  for more luminous objects , common to spheroids of vastly different luminosities : objects plotted in figure[fig : mu0mb]a include dwarf ellipticals and giant , core ellipticals present in the caon et al .  sample .",
    "( at the faint end , bulges are brighter than des of the same luminosity ; we argued in paper  iii that those nuclear disk components that do are not identified by our profile decomposition , might contribute to this offset . )",
    "the quantity  is a useful parametrization of a _ bulge s _ central surface brightness , but it can differ from the _ galaxy s _ central surface brightness , to which the nuclear components also contribute .",
    "the latter quantity is relevant as a diagnostic of dissipation during galaxy formation , and , e.g. , for inferences of the nuclear evolution during galaxy mergers . because most of the nuclear components are unresolved even by  ( paper  iii )",
    ", the true galaxy s central surface brightness is generally not accessible from the present data .",
    "we have therefore explored the trends defined by various measurements of @xmath72 at a fixed , small angular radius ; linear radius ; or a fraction of the bulge s .",
    "the various measurements yield the same trends , namely , a brightening with increasing bulge luminosity .",
    "as an example , figure[fig : mu0mb]b shows the surface brightness measured at a radius of 50 pc against absolute magnitude for our bulges , together with those of ellipticals ( lauer et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter l95 ; caon et al .",

    "the choice of radius is driven by the angular resolution of wfpc2 and the distance to the coma cluster .",

    "both for bulges and power - law ellipticals , brightness increases monotonically with luminosity , the trend only breaking for the core ellipticals due to the flattening of their profiles in the inner 100 - 200 pc ( l95 ; graham et al .",
    "2003 ; trujillo et al .",
    "we find a similar trend of brighter surface brightness with luminosity for any measurement of @xmath86 down to the resolution limit of our data , 1020 pc .",

    "2006 ) . also , it is plausible that our srsic fits of the four lowest luminosity , inclined bulges are affected by undetected inner exponential components  raising the bulge shape index above its true value .",

    "this difference appears also for the de sample of binggeli & jerjen ( 1998 ) and is probably real .",

    "jergen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that , at the faint end of spheroid luminosity , the highly resolved , and also common , dwarf galaxies around the milky way and m31 have central profiles that do not show central excesses over their outer srsic profile fits and have very low central surface brightness .",
    "the trend of brighter central surface brightness for higher luminosities is therefore well established for spheroids of vastly different luminosities , from giant ellitpicals to des ( fig.[fig : mu0mb]a ) .",
    "our findings contrast with the arguments of f97 who favor of a trend of _ fainter _ central surface brightness with increasing luminosity for ellipticals and bulges .",
    "f97 reasoned that , if m32 resided in the virgo cluster , its exceedingly high central surface brightness would be smoothed by the psf to values close to those of other low - luminosity virgo e s . by the same argument",
    ", bulges and low - luminosity ellipticals at distances comparable to virgo might have m32-like central profiles which , with sufficient spatial resolution , would yield @xmath79 values following a faint - ward extrapolation of the trend defined by giant ellipticals , with @xmath51 mag , in figure  [ fig : mu0mb]b .",
    "although jerjen et al .  ( 2000 ) have shown that the picture described by f97 breaks down at the low - luminosity end , one could argue that the central _ galaxy _ surface density , rather than _ bulge _ surface density , of some nucleated , intermediate - luminosity galaxies and bulges may follow the trend argued for by f97 ( unresolved components [ ps ] reside in the centers of 58% of our bulges , see paper  iii ) . specifically , if the central surface brightness of the pss , @xmath137 , became sufficiently _",
    "brighter _ for fainter ps ( and hence bulge ) luminosities , the trend between bulge luminosity and _ galaxy _ central surface brightness could in principle have an opposite slope to that shown in figure[fig : mu0 mb ] for the trends between bulge luminosity and _ bulge _ central surface brightness .",
    "we find this unlikely .",
    "both the central surface brightness of the underlying srsic component ( @xmath138 , eqn.[eqn : mu0sermk ] ) , and the ps luminosities ( @xmath139 , paper  iii ) rapidly become fainter toward lower luminosities , requiring exceedingly high densities for the unresolved components ( over 5 magnitudes in surface brightness ) in order to reverse the trend of figure[fig : mu0 mb ] . bker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using /pc imaging , find that the sizes of nuclei do not correlate with nuclei luminosities , hence the central surface brightness _ of the nuclear clusters _",
    "@xmath137 does not correlate with @xmath140   ( for a sample of late - type spiral nuclei . )",
    "the compact elliptical galaxy m32 does provide a counter - example to the previous reasoning .",
    "the ground - based @xmath141-band surface brightness profile of kent ( 1987 ; see graham 2002 ) , and the color profiles from peletier ( 1993 ) , yield @xmath142(50pc)=14.64 mag . given the absolute magnitude of @xmath143 for the m32 bulge from graham ( 2002 ) ; we use the apparent blue magnitude from leda , and a distance modulus of 24.43 ( jacoby et al .",
    "1992 ) . ignoring the bulge - disk decomposition in determining",
    "the absolute magnitude would not affect our argument .",
    "] , m32 lies within the sequence of bulges and low - luminosity ellipticals in figure[fig : mu0 mb ] . yet ,",
    "the  profiles in f97 yield @xmath142(0.1)=8.52 mag , i.e. , five magnitudes above bulges and ellipticals of the same luminosity . note that the m32 srsic profile shape index derived by graham ( 2002 ) is a modest @xmath144 , well within the range for bulges of similar luminosities ; the high central brightness that makes m32 a prototype , compact elliptical galaxy really refers to a region of radius smaller than 37 parsec only ( graham 2002 excluded radii smaller than 10  from his fit ) .",
    "this inner region is m32 s unresolved source , using the term applied to our bulges .",
    "if the unresolved sources in bulges had similar structure to the m32 nucleus , they could reach very high central surface brightnesses despite their low luminosities .",
    "however , it is unclear whether m32 is representative of spheroids such as those analyzed in this paper ; the bulge of m31 might be a more adequate model ; it does not show such high central surface brightness .",
    "of the four sets of correlations involving bulge luminosity , disk luminosity , bulge central velocity dispersion , and galaxy hubble type t , relations involving bulge luminosity show the strongest level of significance .",
    "this was perhaps expected for bulge intrinsic parameters , but it is significant that disk parameters and bulge - to - disk ratios correlate with bulge luminosity as well .",
    "they also do so with the central velocity dispersion @xmath145 , as a result of the correlation between @xmath145 and luminosity for bulges .",
    "in contrast , the dependencies with t are weak or non - existent .    such lack of scaling with t imply a stronger form of the statement from de jong ( 1996 ) and courteau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that the hubble sequence is scale - free .",
    "these authors noted that bulge and disk scale lengths are correlated , and that their ratio @xmath106 is independent of hubble type .",
    "we reproduce those results in our sample , as do hpg03 in theirs . here , however , the lack of dependence on hubble type is not restricted to length scales : the distributions of _ most _ bulge , disk , and bulge - to - disk parameters versus t shows an absence of trends ( fig.[fig : bdpart ] ) for our early - type disk galaxy sample .",
    "hpg03 find a similar absence of correlations for a later - type sample , selected with different criteria ( galaxies belonging to the perseus - pisces supercluster ) , and analyzed with a different ( 2d ) code , suggesting that this behavior may be common for bulge - disk galaxies .",
    "although the hubble sequence is scale - free , galaxies themselves are not .",
    "the bulge luminosity ( and velocity dispersion ) correlate well with the other properties of the bulge , the disk , and the scaling of these two components .    what structural parameters define the hubble sequence ?",
    "focussing on the early - to - intermediate disk galaxies covered by our sample ( s0sbc ) , structural changes with t are only found in the latest , sbc galaxies ( lower b / d , lower @xmath146 and marginally lower central velocity dispersions ) . for types s0 to sb",
    ", hubble type must be dominantly given by the spiral pattern ( block & puerari 1999 ; seigar , chomey , & james 2003 ) , dust content , and star formation activity .",
    "furthermore , the latter must not be affected by the spheroid luminosity or mass , nor by the relative sizes and brightness of disk and bulge .",
    "it appears that _ the luminosity and size trends commonly associated with the definition of the hubble sequence appear when extreme late - type galaxies are compared to early - types ; but those trends are not gradual , and are absent among early - to - intermediate disk galaxies_.    that bulge luminosity strongly correlates with the properties of both the disk and the bulge - to - disk ratios may be expected from galaxy formation scenarios in which the bulge precedes the disk .",
    "this includes monolithic collapse models akin to the eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage ( 1962 ) model for the formation of the milky way , or cdm - based hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios in which disks grow around already formed bulges of merger origin ( e.g.  baugh et al .  1996 ; abadi et al .  2003 ; sommer - larsen , g \" otz , & portinari 2003 ) .",
    "our results are probably also compatible with the inside - out galaxy formation model of van den bosch ( 1998 ) .",
    "the early formation of bulges does not necessarily imply a classical , slowly - rotating spheroid structure for bulges ; if star formation timescales exceed the dynamical time , such bulges might show rapid rotation and some of the disky properties highlighted by kormendy ( 1993 ) .",
    "are our results compatible with secular evolution models in which the bulge grows from instabilities in an already formed disk ?",
    "the scaling of bulge and disk parameters is generally taken to support secular evolution models ( courteau et al .",
    "1996 ; zhang 2004 ) . here , we find that most bulge parameters show non - significant correlations with the disk @xmath9-band luminosity , suggesting that bulge properties ( , mass , central density ) do not know how massive is the host disk .",
    "perhaps more puzzling , the disk parameters show more well - defined trends with bulge luminosity than with disk luminosity .",
    "indeed , only one galaxy parameter , namely the disk scale length , correlates with the disk luminosity ( @xmath147 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hmkdis ] ) . explaining these relations , or lack of thereof , between galaxy structural parameters ,",
    "will remain key challenges for secular evolution models .",
    "this difficulty is compounded by the evidence of stellar population ages .",
    "we show in paper  i that the bulge populations in the present sample are as old as cluster ellipticals .",
    "our measurements were performed away from the disk plane , hence ongoing or episodic star formation of secular origin could take place in inner regions of the disk .",
    "but old population ages are inferred for the nuclei of later - type spirals from nir spectroscopy ( bendo & joseph 2004 ) . to be compatible with this evidence",
    ", secular evolution must have been of little relevance for the growth of the bulge , or else confined to look - back times of order 10 gyr for our galaxies : the situation essentially reduces to the van den bosch model ; and , timescales need to be known to verify that the term secular applies .",
    "the situation may be different for bulges of later types , and of barred galaxies , which are not addressed in this paper ( see , e.g. , fathi & peletier 2003 ; castro - rodrguez & garz ' on 2004 ) ; although , in late - type bulges , young populations are statistically associated with morphological disturbances , pointing to external , rather than internal - secular , processes ( kannappan et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "hence , from the population information in paper  i and the structural information in this paper , it appears that bulges of unbarred , early- to intermediate - type disk galaxies can not have significantly grown from disk instabilities in the last @xmath110 gyr . a small amount of star formation is probably occurring in almost every galaxy nucleus , as evidenced by dust in the very centers of bulges ( e.g.  paper  i ) , and by the presence of young stars ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "bar dynamics could be feeding such activity , but , for early - type disk galaxies , star formation level is too low to affect the general bulge population .",
    "our conclusions on bulge formation / growth are consistent with the current understanding that many mature galaxies were largely in place by @xmath148 ( e.g.  brinchmann & ellis 2000 ; simard et al .",
    "2002 ) , and that early - type galaxies in the field became red between redshifts @xmath148 and 2 ( eliche - moral et al .  2006 ) .",

    "<S> the lack of significant correlations between bulge pararmeters ( size , luminosity or density ) on disk luminosity , remains a challenge for secular evolution models of bulge growth . </S>"
