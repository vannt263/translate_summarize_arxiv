    "recently , we proposed new mechanism of superconducting ( sc ) pairing in anisotropic quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system typical of high - temperature superconducting ( htsc ) cuprate compounds @xcite .",
    "pairs with large momentum @xmath1 ( @xmath1pairs ) are considered ; here , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the value of the fermi momentum directed along @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the cooper channel of pairing becomes inefficient when the pair momentum exceeds a value of the order of @xmath4 ; here , @xmath5 is the sc gap at @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the same relatively small value of the pair momentum corresponds to the wavelength of spatially inhomogeneous sc phase arising in weakly ferromagnetic electron system @xcite as well .",
    "the cooper channel at @xmath8 is suppressed due to pauli s exclusive principle which restricts the phase volume accessible for the electron states contributing to the @xmath1pair state .",
    "this phase volume decreases rapidly with @xmath9 and vanishes at @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , pairing with large pair momentum may be possible if some rearrangement in the electron system provides finite ( and sufficiently large ) phase volume for the states forming @xmath1  pair .",
    "any rearrangement of electrons in momentum space which transfers a part of them across the fermi surface ( fs ) results in an increase of the energy of the electron subsystem of a crystal .",
    "if the electron subsystem interacts with some other one , for example , antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin subsystem , and such an interaction results in a gain in total energy , new fs arises corresponding to new ground state of the system .",
    "all of undoped htsc cuprates are af insulators , therefore , the pairing mechanism @xcite is not exotic , most likely , this mechanism is typical of doped htsc cuprate compounds . electronic structure and physical properties of such layered compounds as htsc cuprates are studied in detail @xcite .",
    "conducting @xmath11 plane ( one or more per unit cell ) is the key structural unit of any htsc cuprate compound .",
    "the neighboring planes are separated by reservoirs that is atomic layers which , under doping , inject carriers ( holes , as usual ) into these planes .",
    "the interplane coupling is very weak and this is just the reason one may consider htsc cuprates as 2d electron system . in undoped cuprates ,",
    "there is long - range af order below the neel temperature , @xmath12 .",
    "doping leads to progressive destruction of long - range order and , as a final result , to a rise of strongly anisotropic metallic ( m ) state .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements @xcite result in unambiguous conclusion that , in the normal ( n ) state , any htsc cuprate has large fs . observed fs s are in good agreement with band structure calculations @xcite based on the density functional theory . in the case of hole - doped compounds , the fermi contour ( fc ) that is the cross - section of the fs which is parallel to conducting layers is a square with rounded corners .",
    "the fc of holes is centered at @xmath13 and exhibits strong nesting feature along [ 100]-type directions .",
    "this is an evidence in behalf of the significant role of the interaction between next - nearest - neighbor atoms as far as taking account of nearest - neighbor interaction only results in the square fc with perfect nesting along [ 110]-type directions exactly at half - filling @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , in the case of electron - doped compounds , such as @xmath14 , any appreciable nesting of the fc is absent and the fc is closed to a circle . at approximately half - filling ,",
    "long parts of the fc are situated close to the saddle points of hole dispersion @xcite .",
    "hole doping moves the fermi level towards the saddle point whereas electron doping acts in reverse direction .",
    "therefore , in hole - doped compound , nesting feature of hole fc appears in relatively wide concentration range .",
    "weak dispersion along the nesting directions results in the fact that longitudinal ( along the nested straight - line parts of the fc ) component of the fermi velocity sufficiently smaller than the transversal one @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an effective enhancement of 2d density of states in the vicinity of logarithmic van hove singularity due to the saddle point @xcite .",
    "thus , there is an extended vicinity of the saddle point in which the principal values of 2d tensor of reversed reduced effective mass have unlike signs .",
    "one can say that , in such a vicinity , momentum space has _ hyperbolic _",
    "( pseudoeuclidean ) metrics . due to nesting feature of the fc ,",
    "the absolute values of the principal effective masses differ strongly from each other : positive longitudinal mass is essentially more than the absolute value of negative transversal mass .",
    "it should be pointed out once more that , in a case of any hole - doped cuprate compound , long straight - line parts of the fc are situated , in main , just in such `` _ flat - band _ '' or `` _ extended van hove singularity _ '' vicinity @xcite .    in htsc cuprates , the sc state appears in some doping interval , @xmath15 , bounded both above and below . both superconducting transition temperature @xmath16 and superfluid density ( or phase stiffness )",
    "@xmath17 may demonstrate highly complicated dependence on doping in this interval @xcite .",
    "the absolute maximum of @xmath16 corresponds to the optimal doping , @xmath18 .",
    "phase diagram typical of hole - doped htsc cuprates is presented in fig .  1 .    in underdoped ( @xmath19 ) compounds , one - particle density of states",
    "is suppressed essentially at @xmath20 .",
    "such a suppression may be interpreted as a rise of the so - called pseudogap in the excitation spectrum @xcite .",
    "the temperature @xmath21 corresponding to a crossover between the n state at @xmath22 and the `` pseudogap regime '' at @xmath23 decreases with doping increase and becomes approximately equal to @xmath16 at @xmath24 .",
    "the pseudogap @xmath25 , just as the sc gap @xmath5 , is strongly anisotropic , and also , the character of the anisotropy is the same both for @xmath25 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the maxima of their absolute values correspond to antinodal [ 100]-type directions . the minimal values ( which , possibly , are equal to zero ) both of @xmath25 and @xmath5 correspond to nodal [ 110]-type directions .",
    "pseudogap evolution with temperature decrease from @xmath21 to @xmath16 was studied using arpes technique @xcite in underdoped single crystals @xmath26 .",
    "the pseudogap arises at @xmath27 at four points of the fc corresponding to antinodal directions .",
    "lowering of temperature from @xmath21 leads to pseudogap extension in the directions of the corners of the fc .",
    "thus , the fc turns out to be discontinuous and has the form of four arcs ( rounded corners of the square fc ) which are not connected with each other @xcite .",
    "the arc length decreases gradually with temperature lowering . at @xmath28 ,",
    "the fc disappears and , instead of it , the sc gap arises which has minimal ( or equal to zero ) values just in the points ( corresponding to nodal directions ) where the fc shrinks @xcite .",
    "knight shift measurements indicate that there is singlet pairing of carriers when the electron system of htsc cuprates is in the sc state @xcite . therefore , observed momentum dependence of the sc gap may correspond to either anisotropic @xmath29-type or @xmath30-type of orbital symmetry @xcite . the same orbital symmetry and the same energy scale of @xmath5 and @xmath25 @xcite enable one to suppose that the sc gap and the pseudogap are of the same origin .",
    "thus , the pseudogap regime may be considered as an incoherent state of paired charge carriers @xcite .    in the theory by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) which explains the conventional superconductivity successfully @xcite , attraction due to virtual phonon exchange is a driven force leading to pairing of carriers . in principle ,",
    "phonon mechanism of cooper pairing should not be excluded as a mechanism of htsc @xcite although it is difficult to explain satisfactorily some essential features of htsc state , for example , the symmetry of the sc gap . in view of the fact that the phase diagram of any htsc cuprate has a region with long - range af order , af fluctuation exchange as a mechanism of pairing @xcite seems as quite natural ( neutron scattering experiments @xcite exhibit broadened bragg peaks up to the optimal doping ) .",
    "the other point of view is founded on the statement that ground state energy gain at the sc transition in htsc cuprates is due to a lowering of the kinetic energy arising when two of like - charged carriers form a pair @xcite . in such a case , generally speaking , one needs no attraction between carriers and screened coulomb repulsion remains as a natural essential interaction in the electron system .",
    "af fluctuations ( short - range af order ) may lead to a specific quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) self  organization in 2d electron system of htsc cuprates .",
    "elastic neutron scattering study in @xmath31 compound enables one to assume that , at @xmath32 , holes doped into a crystal are situated in 1d antiphase boundaries ( charge stripes ) separating hole depleted domains with af order @xcite .",
    "a rise of such static stripe structure ( in a general way , predicted in @xcite ) may be described as a transfer of excess holes from af part of a stripe into antiphase boundary ( m part of a stripe ) . in underdoped",
    "@xmath33 which does not contain nd atoms , dynamic ( fluctuating ) stripes were observed @xcite .",
    "dynamic stripe magnitude , just as the magnitude of af fluctuations , decreases with doping and , at @xmath34 , neutron scattering technique does not make possible a resolution of strongly broadened stripe peaks of rather low intensity . a stripe structure may exist being independent of superconductivity but such a structure ( just as af fluctuations ) and superconductivity are closely and in a nontrivial way connected with each other . as an indirect confirmation of this statement one may take into consideration the fact that , in @xmath35 at @xmath36 when static stripe magnitude is maximal ,",
    "there is a local minimum on the doping dependence of the sc transition temperature @xcite ] . on the contrary , it is possible that dynamic stripes stimulate superconductivity @xcite .",
    "experimental data available make possible to determine the main features and details of the electronic structure which are essential to understand the character of the sc state of htsc cuprates and interpret their physical properties qualitatively .",
    "firstly , all doped htsc compounds have 2d electronic structure with strong nesting of the fc situated in an extended vicinity of the saddle point of the hole dispersion .",
    "secondly , in all doped htsc compounds , doping regions corresponding to af and sc phases are close to each other and , in the sc region , there is short - range af order resulting in stripe self - organization of spin and charge subsystems of the crystal .",
    "the theory here developed takes into account these principal features of the electronic structure and can qualitatively explain the key experimental facts relating both to n and sc state of htsc cuprates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section is dedicated to the formulation of the conditions under which the pairing with large pair momentum may be possible ; in addition , we introduce the concept of the `` pair '' fermi contour . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the problem of a single pair in momentum space with hyperbolic metrics and discuss the symmetry properties of the pair wave function .",
    "iv contains a discussion of the character of the two poles of the scattering amplitude corresponding to a quasi - stationary state of the pair and superconducting instability .",
    "effective interaction between particles composing a pair with large momentum is considered in sec .",
    "v. in sec .",
    "vi we derive the equation defining the sc order parameter .",
    "the approximate solutions of this equation are presented in sec .",
    "vii both in the case of attraction and repulsion between the components of the pair . in sec .",
    "viii , we discuss sc transition induced chemical potential shift , and then , in sec .",
    "ix , doping dependent sc condensation energy is studied . in sec .",
    "x , we consider some special case of sc state arising due to weak ferromagnetism , associated with stripe structure .",
    "xi is dedicated to a brief discussion of some key experimental results related to both n and sc state of htsc cuprates ; also , we discuss some other possible reasons of `` opening '' of the pfc and propose a qualitative interpretation of available experimental data in the scope of the theory developed here .",
    "let us consider two electrons or two holes with total momentum @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are momenta of the particles composing a pair .",
    "this is a pair of noninteracting particles .",
    "thus , now and below in this section , we do not fall outside the limits of usual one - particle approximation and the pair here introduced may be named as a _",
    "slave pair_. further , taking account of the screened coulomb interaction between particles composing the pairs , we use such pairs to construct a sc state .",
    "filling of the states inside the fc results in the fact that permissible values of a momentum of the relative motion of the @xmath40pair , @xmath41 , belong to a certain domain of momentum space .",
    "such a domain , which we denote as @xmath42 , has a form dependent on @xmath43 and on a shape of the fc @xcite .",
    "typical of any hole - doped htsc cuprate fc is a square with rounded corners as it is represented schematically in fig .  2 .",
    "if the pair momentum is directed along [ 100 ] and @xmath44 the corresponding domain has a form shown in the same figure .",
    "it is clear from fig.2 how one can define such a domain at any given @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that the area ( labeled by the same symbol @xmath45 ) of the domain @xmath42 tends to zero when @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the statistical weight of the states which compose pairs with @xmath47 is equal to zero even in the case of perfect nesting @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the model used in @xcite does not take into account the existence of an extended saddle point and hyperbolic metrics of momentum space , therefore , a pairing with @xmath47 turns out to be impossible . for arbitrary direction of @xmath40 , there are , generally speaking , eight domains corresponding to the pair momenta which are equivalent to given vector @xmath40 ( for special , antinodal or nodal , direction there are four equivalent vectors ) .",
    "however , at preassigned deviation of @xmath40 from @xmath48 , the statistical weight ( the area @xmath49 ) depends on the @xmath40 direction decreasing from a maximal value for antinodal to a minimal one for nodal directions .",
    "it is quite obvious that the binding energy of @xmath40pair has to increase with @xmath49 , therefore , one may expect that a rise of the sc condensate should be due to pairs with momenta corresponding to antinodal directions .",
    "there is an experimental evidence in behalf of the consideration of hole pairs with large total momentum . as an example",
    ", one may consider the so - called `` commensurate''neutron resonance ( 41 mev ) peak below @xmath16 which is usually associated with a rise of resonance collective triplet @xmath50mode @xcite corresponding to the saddle point .",
    "recently , in @xcite was observed `` incommensurate '' magnetic fluctuations in htsc cuprates . as it is pointed out in ref.@xcite",
    ", the incommensurate mode transforms continuously into the commensurate one demonstrating , in addition , a negative ( downward away from the commensurate momentum ) dispersion @xcite .",
    "such a tendency of softening of this triplet @xmath50mode can be interpreted as an indirect evidence of the phase transition possibility associated with softening of a certain singlet mode corresponding to large and `` incommensurate '' pair momentum .",
    "almost straight - line parts of the fc belong to the region of momentum space with hyperbolic metrics .",
    "therefore , the energy of the relative motion of a pair inside @xmath42 , @xmath51 at relatively small @xmath52 may be approximately represented as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is hole dispersion and , as it follows from a symmetry consideration , the coordinate axes are directed parallel ( the @xmath55axis ) and perpendicular ( the @xmath56axis ) to the fc ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "these coordinate axis directions correspond to the principal directions of 2d tensor of reduced reciprocal effective mass ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 are dependent on @xmath40 principal values of this tensor ) .",
    "due to strong nesting of the fc , the absolute values of the effective masses differ considerably from each other , namely , a dimensionless parameter @xmath59 .",
    "the domain @xmath42 consists of two parts , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , in which the energy of the relative motion of @xmath62 pair is negative and positive , respectively .",
    "the domain @xmath63 , also shown in fig .  2 , corresponds to a pair with total momentum @xmath64 ( @xmath64pair ) outside of the fc ; thus @xmath65 .",
    "this domain consists of two parts , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , corresponding to negative and positive energy of the relative motion of @xmath68pair as well .",
    "excitations composing @xmath69pair inside the fc are electrons whereas holes are the excitations which compose @xmath70pair outside of the fc .",
    "both @xmath42 and @xmath63 belong to the region of momentum space inside 2d brillouin zone which has hyperbolic metrics .",
    "in contrast to cooper pairs with @xmath6 , the energy of the relative motion of @xmath40pairs at @xmath71 is sensitive not only to the value of the fermi velocity but to signs and absolute values of the effective masses . in the case of hyperbolic metrics ,",
    "@xmath40pair density of states exhibits a logarithmic van hove singularity corresponding to zero energy of the relative motion as it is shown schematically in fig .",
    "weak dispersion along one of the directions in 2d momentum space ( the @xmath55axis in fig .",
    "2 ) leads to the fact that @xmath40pair density of states has almost 1d character @xcite .    by definition of the ground state of the electron system ,",
    "all pair states inside @xmath42 are occupied whereas the states inside @xmath63 are vacant .",
    "such a filling of the states in momentum space corresponds to spatially homogeneous state of the electron system . at given @xmath40 ,",
    "states of the relative motion of @xmath40pair are characterized by the relative motion density of states , @xmath72 .",
    "upper edge of pair density of states in the domain @xmath42 corresponds to the fermi level ( fig .",
    "there is a finite energy gap @xmath73 between the upper edge of @xmath72 and the lower one relating to pair density of states , @xmath74 , in the domain @xmath63 as it is seen from fig .",
    "3 . therefore",
    ", any transfer of a pair from @xmath42 into @xmath63 is necessarily connected with an energy increase due to an increase of center - of - mass energy . however",
    ", it should be noted that the pairs having positive energy of the relative motion leave the domain @xmath42 whereas the pairs with negative energy arrive at the domain @xmath63 .",
    "such transfers of pairs from the domain @xmath42 into a region of momentum space outside of the fc may bear a relation to well - known spatially inhomogeneous ( stripe ) structure in which there is an alternation of hole enriched and depleted 1d regions @xcite .",
    "the region of momentum space into which @xmath40pairs may transfer is either that part , @xmath75 , of the domain @xmath42 which is situated outside of the fc or the domain @xmath63 corresponding to total pair momentum @xmath68 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "as far as relative motion density of states which corresponds to @xmath70pair belonging to the subdomain @xmath66 is considerably greater than density of states corresponding to the subdomain @xmath75 we may restrict ourselves to a consideration of the transfers @xmath76 only .",
    "suppose that a number of pairs , @xmath77 , passes from @xmath61 into @xmath66 , so that in the subdomain @xmath61 ( in the zero - temperature limit and in the absence of an interaction between holes ) , vacant pair states arise in a certain ( small in comparison with @xmath78 ) energy interval near @xmath79 .",
    "the same number of pairs occupies a small energy interval ( which may be determined using pair number conservation condition ) near the lower edge of the band corresponding to the subdomain @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the energy increase due to pair transfers from @xmath61 into @xmath66 may be estimated as @xmath80 .",
    "transfers of pairs , @xmath81 , in momentum space may be related to transfers of holes from af parts of stripes into m parts in real space ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "an enhancement of af correlations due to such transfers results in some reducing of the energy which might compensate the energy increase due to the excitation of hole pairs leading to transfers @xmath81 .",
    "an energy gain due to a removal of @xmath62pairs from @xmath61 , that is from af parts of stripes , may be estimated phenomenologically if one introduces depending on doping parameter @xmath82 which may be treated as nearest - neighbor spin correlation function being a measure of af short - range order .",
    "let us assume that each hole pair transferring from the subdomain @xmath61 into the subdomain @xmath66 gives an energy gain equal to @xmath83 .",
    "then , total decrease in the energy of holes due to such transfers of @xmath77 hole pairs may be estimated as @xmath84 .",
    "thus , a rise of the stripe structure lowers the ground state energy provided that @xmath85 the existence in the domain @xmath86 of hole filled part ( for which we use above introduced notation @xmath60 ) and vacant part ( @xmath61 ) makes possible pairing of carriers in the vicinity of the lines separating filled and vacant subdomains .",
    "the energy of the relative motion of @xmath62pair with respect to the value of the chemical potential is negative inside @xmath60 and positive inside @xmath61 , therefore , the lines separating these subdomains ( the lines of zero relative - motion energy ) play role of a peculiar `` pair '' fermi contour ( pfc ) on which the sc gap may arise .",
    "such a conclusion is related both to the domains @xmath42 and @xmath87 , therefore , pfc is situated both inside and outside of the parent fc .",
    "if the value of the vector @xmath88 which may be considered as a reciprocal spatial scale of the stripe structure appreciably exceeds a character scale , @xmath89 , of non - zero sc order parameter in momentum space , one may consider the pairing problems in @xmath42 and @xmath63 independently from each other . in the following ,",
    "we consider just the case when @xmath90 .",
    "first of all , let us consider a hole @xmath40pair taking into account two - particle potential interaction between the particles composing the pair .",
    "as stated above , the momenta of interacting particles are confined inside the domain @xmath42 .",
    "we suppose that this domain belongs to a region of momentum space with hyperbolic metrics . a wave function of @xmath40pair may be written as @xmath91 here , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are radius vectors of the particles , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 is a wave function of the relative motion",
    ", @xmath97 is a normalizing area .    on account of the crystal symmetry ,",
    "all wave functions @xmath98 corresponding to the momenta @xmath99 turn out to be equivalent ; here , @xmath100 is a crystal symmetry group transformation .",
    "therefore , the @xmath40pair wave function taking into account the crystal symmetry should be represented as a linear combination of the form @xmath101 } c_{{\\hat g}k } ^{(\\gamma ) } { \\psi_{{\\hat g}k}}.\\ ] ] a choice of the coefficients @xmath102 is determined by the irreducible representation @xmath103 of the crystal symmetry group according to which the wave function eq .  ( 5 ) transforms under the action of crystal symmetry operators @xmath100 .",
    "it should be noted especially that the wave function eq .",
    "( 5 ) corresponds to current - less state in view of the fact that @xmath104 .    taking account of the fact that the domains @xmath105 corresponding to equivalent momenta , @xmath99 , either do not overlap at all or overlap in a small way ( fig .  2 ) and ,",
    "also , a scattering of @xmath40pair from any such a domain into an equivalent one corresponds to rather large change in the total momentum of the pair , one can , in the first approximation , neglect any inter - domain scattering .",
    "then , with regard for eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , the equivalent hamiltonian of the relative motion of @xmath40pair may be presented in the form @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 is an effective potential energy of the particles composing @xmath40pair .",
    "this energy , which will be defined and discussed in detail in sec .",
    "v , depends on the domain @xmath42 in which scattering due to interaction is permitted .",
    "when the area @xmath42 is large enough one can suppose that @xcite @xmath109 .",
    "generally speaking , all of the eigen - functions of the operator eq .",

    "the scattering amplitude is represented in the form @xmath137 where qss decay is written as @xmath138 in the case of tetragonal crystal ( 2d symmetry group @xmath139 ) , one can separate all of the equivalent vectors @xmath140 into two subsets .",
    "one of them , which contains the vector @xmath40 itself , also contains all of the vectors @xmath140 related to each other by reflections with respect to the coordinate axes , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",

    "such a transfer of a number of pairs in momentum space may result in a redistribution of carriers in real space .",
    "total energy increase which is due to this redistribution may be compensated when , as it appears to be just the case being related to hole - doped htsc cuprates , there is an energy decrease due to partial restoration of af ordering in hole - depleted regions arisen .",
    "an alternation of hole - depleted and enriched regions in real space forms charge and spin spatial structure ( irregular and dynamic , generally speaking ) of the electron system . under definite conditions",
    "( in particular , in underdoped regime ) , this structure , associated closely with short - range af order fluctuations , becomes apparent as quasi - regular static or dynamic 1d stripe structure .",
    "such phase separation @xcite accompanied with a change of a filling of hole states in momentum space may correspond to the minimum of total energy of the electron system .",
    "short - range af ordering stabilizing stripes due to redistribution of hole pairs is intrinsic but not unique possible attribute of such a self - organization .",
    "for example , long - range orbital magnetic ordering @xcite , known as a flux phase state , may play the same role as well .",
    "although there is not any direct evidence of existence of flux phase state in cuprates , this phase perhaps is associated with the so - called hidden - order - parameter region in the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "such a scenario of total energy gain due to carrier redistribution is not the only one .",
    "another one possibility , analogous to that which may be in the case of the superconductivity @xcite , may be related to the problem here discussed .",
    "namely , one may to consider an increase of af transition temperature resulting from a change of an excitation energy distribution due to transitions from @xmath61 into @xmath66 .    in any of the cases considered here , a redistribution of carriers in momentum space may result in a rise of new zero - excitation - energy line separating occupied and vacant states in 2d brillouin zone .",
    "we believe that , first of all , a rise of vacant states inside and occupied states outside of the fc must lead to a formation of pairs with total momenta corresponding to the largest areas @xmath42 and @xmath63 with @xmath1 and @xmath267 along the antinodal directions .",
    "such pairs have the largest binding energies and exist up to the temperature , @xmath21 , of the beginning of the pseudogap regime .",
    "then , the lowering of the temperature from @xmath21 to @xmath16 results in a gradual rise of electron and hole pairs with total momenta having different values and directions and corresponding to some set of domains @xmath42 and @xmath63 . at last , at @xmath28 , there is a beginning of sc condensation of pairs into the state with the largest binding energy .",
    "sc condensation gives a start to the growth of the unoccupied part , @xmath510 , of the `` antinodal '' domain @xmath42 at the expense of a redistribution of carriers both inside and outside of the fc .",
    "thus , as a final result , zero - energy line for pair excitations arises inside the domain @xmath42 ( similarly , such a line arises inside the corresponding domain @xmath63 outside of the fc as well ) .",
    "just this line may be treated as `` pair '' fermi contour ( pfc ) .",
    "the conception of pfc and hyperbolic pairing enables one to explain qualitatively some general features of phase diagram and many surprising experimental data relating to high@xmath16 cuprates .",
    "in particular , a rise of both sc and pseudogap state may be considered as a manifestation of hyperbolic metrics of momentum space and screened coulomb repulsion between holes .",
    "therefore , both sc gap and pseudogap must have one and the same energy scale and their @xmath30type `` orbital '' symmetry , in fact , is determined by the crystal symmetry",
    ". a character spatial scale of a pair both in qss and sc state ( the coherence length ) is of the order of a few interatomic distances @xcite . as an evidence in favor of the pfc conception , one may consider an interpretation of two interesting experiments , relating to examination of electronic spectrum of several of htsc cuprates with the help of arpes technique . in the case ,",
    "when an energy of excited electron is near the fermi level @xmath243 ( less than about 100 mev ) , arpes data @xcite indicate unequivocally that electronic structure has 2d character and fc remains in the well - known form of a square with rounded corners @xcite .",
    "if an electron is excited far from @xmath243 ( about 500 mev ) the electronic structure becomes rather 1d than 2d .",
    "it should be noted that , truly , a simple cross - shaped form of the fc , in fact , derived not directly from experimental data but offered as a result of motivated speculations based on the simplest 1d stripe model .",
    "thus , the arpes data @xcite evidence the simultaneous existence of both fc and pfc .",
    "such fairly surprising conclusion is entirely consistent with the concept of the pfc introduced here .",
    "in fact , to detect the pfc using arpes technique one needs an electron excitation with an energy which is essentially less than @xmath243 : if excited state is situated near the pfc , the excited electron may easily find a partner to form a pair .",
    "one can believe that the so - called `` dip - hump structure '' in the arpes spectra @xcite is one more evidence in favour of the concept of pfc : a hump , arising ( just in the case of antinodal direction corresponding to the maximal value of @xmath42 ) at energies which are essentially more than the energy related to the quasi - particle peak , may be connected with the excitations in the form of pairs near the pfc .",
    "another one unusual feature of htsc cuprates with @xmath30type symmetry of the sc gap can be qualitatively interpreted in the framework of the pfc conception .",
    "it is believed that impurity scattering has to lead to essential reducing of @xmath16 because the scattering of a pair into regions of momentum space corresponding to nodal directions means , in fact , a break of the pair . in this sense ,",
    "nonmagnetic impurities play role similar to that which play magnetic impurities in conventional superconductors . however , the experimental fact is that the htsc cuprates are weakly sensitive to impurity content .",
    "thus , there are no experimental data which were confirmed such a `` destructive '' influence of impurities on the sc state . in this connection",
    ", it should be noted that , to reconcile such a statement with the experiment , one has to suppose that any interaction resulting in a scattering of cooper pair in @xmath30-type superconductor , including the interaction which leads to a binding in the pair itself , must possess the peculiar feature , namely , the scattering into `` nodal regions '' has to be more weak in comparison with the scattering into `` antinodal regions '' ( the so - called `` forward scattering '' ) @xcite . using the pfc conception ,",
    "it is not necessary to consider any peculiar feature of a scattering as far as the scattering inside the domain @xmath42 , that is a variation of the direction of @xmath511pair relative motion momentum , is , in fact , almost isotropic as in the case of @xmath29scattering of cooper pairs in conventional superconductors .",
    "a problem connected with a strong anisotropy of reversed relaxation times , that is an existence of the so - called `` hot '' and `` cold '' spots on the fermi surface @xcite , can be qualitatively solved in the framework of the pfc conception too . indeed , a rise of @xmath1pairs results in their free in - plane motion without a change of charge density whereas a character of the interaction of paired carriers may be changed essentially : this interaction , being inside antinodal regions , turns out to be more weak as compared to the interaction of unpaired carriers inside nodal regions @xcite .",
    "the idea we use here is based , in main , on the fact that the pfc should be `` opened '' that is , due to a rise of stripes and hyperbolic metrics of momentum space , some piece of the fc turns out to be the same as a line of zero kinetic energy of the relative motion of a hole pair with large momentum .",
    "if such a line corresponding to a certain @xmath1 is close enough to rather large piece of the real fc ( such a case may occur , for example , just at @xmath512 and @xmath513 ) the pairing mechanism here discussed may be possible as well even without any hole redistribution both in momentum space ( between the domains @xmath514 and @xmath63 ) and in real space ( that is without a rise of a stripe structure ) . in this case , the value of @xmath515 plays role of a cut - off parameter since it must appear in the arguments of the logarithmic functions in eq .",
    "( 63 ) together with the sc gap parameters @xmath516 and @xmath517 . in a sense ,",
    "the pairing problem becomes analogous to that which arises in the case of cooper pairing in weak ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "this statement is consistent with the results presented in sections  iii and iv .",
    "namely , at @xmath518 and @xmath519 ( it is obvious that the parameter @xmath519 plays role of an energy distance between the fc and the line of zero energy of pair relative motion ) , the imaginary part of the sc pole of the scattering amplitude ( which is proportional to the sc gap parameter ) exceeds necessarily the real part of the pole due to a logarithmic singularity of @xmath125 at @xmath520 , as one can see from fig .",
    "thus , one can assume a possibility of the existence of crystals with such a form of the fc which is optimally conforming with the form and energy position of a line of zero kinetic energy of the relative motion of a hole pair with large total momentum ( one can consider hyperbolic lines used here as a certain limiting case ) .",
    "as a result , in such crystals , the pairing mechanism discussed here may dominate ( possibly , even without af state in the neighborhood of the sc one and thus without a rise of stripes as it maybe occurs in cuprate compounds with more than one @xmath11 plane in the unit cell @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that a superconducting state with large ( @xmath521 ) total pair momentum was previously studied @xcite in the framework of the microscopic model of the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism or charge - density wave ( a structural phase transition ; in such a case , the momentum @xmath522 turns into a new vector of the reciprocal lattice ) . in this model ,",
    "the state with large pair momentum arises as a result of coexistence of af ordering and cooper pairs with zero total momentum .",
    "phenomenologically , such transitions as a break of corresponding symmetry is usually considered in the framework of , for example , so(5 ) or su(4 ) models @xcite .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "@xcite have assembled af and @xmath30wave sc order parameters into a five - dimensional vector and have postulated the symmetry of unified in such a way order parameter under rotations of an so(5 ) group .",
    "however , to obtain the closed lie algebra of fermion pairing and particle - hole operators describing antiferromagnetism and superconductivity , one has to consider a more general , than so(5 ) symmetry , for example , the su(4 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "such more general approach leads directly to a rise of the components of the unified order parameter corresponding to pairs with large , of the order of the af vector , total momentum @xcite .",
    "thus , one may conclude that @xmath40 and @xmath70  pairs introduced in our paper in a microscopic way are fully consistent with rather general symmetry constraints .",
    "note that if the vector @xmath1 coincides with the af vector exactly the sc order parameter due to a rise of @xmath523  pairs and the af ( triplet ) order parameter turn out to be connected to another one sc order parameter corresponding to pairs with zero total momentum .",
    "a small difference between @xmath523 and the af vector leads to a small total momentum of these pairs .",
    "such pairs may be in singlet spin state ( conventional cooper pairs ) or in triplet spin state .",
    "the case we discuss in this paper corresponds just to the latter of the two possibilities , namely , triplet af order coexists with singlet sc order due to @xmath1  pairs and triplet sc order due to the pairs with small total momentum .",
    "the phenomenological approach used here to take account of the influence of af fluctuations on carrier pairing enables one to interpret qualitatively the key experimental data relating to htsc cuprates .",
    "we believe that the principal conception of hyperbolic pairing and a rise of pair fermi contour is an inherent feature of cuprate electron system which has to become apparent both in band scheme and in appropriate models of strong - correlated systems , such as @xmath524 model @xcite with regard for next - nearest - neighbor interactions ( the so - called @xmath525 model @xcite ) , description of the electronic structure .",

    "<S> the pairing of charge carriers with large pair momentum is considered in connection with high - temperature superconductivity of cuprate compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of pairing arises due to some essential features of quasi - two - dimensional electronic structure of cuprates : ( i ) _ the fermi contour with strong nesting features _ ; ( ii ) _ the presence of extended saddle point near the fermi level _ ; ( iii ) _ the existence of some ordered state ( for example , antiferromagnetic ) close to the superconducting one as a reason for an appearing of `` pair '' fermi contour resulting from carrier redistribution in momentum space_. in an extended vicinity of the saddle point , momentum space has hyperbolic ( pseudoeuclidean ) metrics , therefore , the principal values of two - dimensional reciprocal reduced effective mass tensor have unlike signs . at small momenta of the relative motion of a pair with large pair momentum , </S>",
    "<S> the pairing is sensitive just to sign and value of the effective mass but not to only the value of the fermi velocity as it is in the case of cooper pairing . </S>",
    "<S> nesting of the fermi contour results in an increase of the statistical weight of the pair with large total momentum due to an extension of momentum space domain which corresponds to permissible values of the relative motion momentum . </S>",
    "<S> rearrangement of holes in momentum space results in a rise of `` pair '' fermi contour which may be defined as zero - energy line for relative motion of the pair . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting gap arises just on this line . </S>",
    "<S> pair fermi contour formation inside the region of momentum space with hyperbolic metrics results in not only superconducting pairing but in a rise of quasi - stationary state in the relative motion of the pair . </S>",
    "<S> such a state has rather small decay and may be related to the pseudogap regime of underdoped cuprates </S>",
    "<S> . bounded states of the relative motion of the pair is studied both for attraction and repulsion between the components of the pair . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that the pairing in cuprates may be due to screened coulomb repulsion . in this case , the superconducting energy gap in hole - doped cuprates exists in the region of hole concentration which is bounded both above and below . the superconducting state with </S>",
    "<S> positive condensation energy exists in more narrow range of doping level inside this region . </S>",
    "<S> such hole concentration dependence correlates with typical phase diagram of cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing mechanism and the pair fermi contour conception make possible a rise of the superconducting condensate and quasi - stationary states of pairs and may provide qualitative interpretation for the key experimental facts relating to cuprates , namely : ( 1 ) observable values of the superconducting transition temperature ; ( 2 ) the same symmetry and the same energy scale of the superconducting gap and the pseudogap ; ( 3 ) relatively small values of the coherence length ; ( 4 ) asymmetry of tunnel current - bias characteristic ; ( 5 ) an `` apparent '' violation of the ferrell - glover - tinkham low - frequency optical sum rule ; ( 6 ) quasi - particle peak and `` dip - hump '' structure of the angle - resolved photoemission and tunnel spectra ; ( 7 ) ) anomalous large ( as compared with the prediction of the theories of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer type ) values of @xmath0 ratio observed in extremely underdoped cuprates with hole doping ; ( 8) the pair fermi contour conception does not require any additional suggestion relating to a character of carrier or pair scattering such as the so - called `` forward scattering '' or `` hot and cold spots '' on the fermi surface ; ( 9 ) the pair fermi contour conception is fairly consistent with a character of doping dependence of pseudogap state crossover temperature and also both superconducting transition temperature and superfluid density observed in htsc cuprates . </S>"
