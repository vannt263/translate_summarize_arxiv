    "despite the great success of the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) one essential component of the theory remains a puzzle : it is the actual mechanism behind the electroweak symmetry breaking ( esb ) .",
    "the higgs complex doublet scalar field of a non - zero vacuum expectation value serves as a benchmark hypothesis for the mechanism .",
    "it is not the only plausible hypothesis though .",
    "a direct consequence of the higgs hypothesis is the presence of the higgs boson in the particle spectrum of the sm , not observed to these days .",
    "there is a host of candidates for the suitable extensions of the sm .",
    "they range from supersymmetric theories with multiple elementary higgs bosons in their spectra to the theories of new strong interactions , like in technicolor , which might form bound states of new elementary particles in analogy with qcd .",
    "these bound states might appear in the particle spectrum as new resonances .    in more recent theories like the little higgs models and the gauge - higgs unification models , their dual - description relation to the heavy composite higgs and",
    "the no higgs strongly - interacting models has been demonstrated ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of these new models introduce new quarks and new vector particles at about 1  tev .    facing this plethora of alternative theories",
    "it is highly desirable to describe their low - energy phenomenology in a unified way .",
    "thus , it is very useful to exploit the formalism of effective lagrangians .",
    "we use the so - called _ hidden local symmetry _ ( hls ) approach @xcite to introduce the new vector resonance . the hls formalism along with the ads / cft correspondence plus deconstruction is also behind the dual - description relation of the recent models mentioned above @xcite .    in our model , the new @xmath2 vector bosons mix with the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "while the mixing complicates theoretical analysis of the model it might provide some advantages in experimental searches .",
    "it is natural to assume that apart from the electroweak gauge bosons the new vector triplet couples to the third generation of quarks only .",
    "therefore it would seem natural to search for the signs of the new resonances in the processes where besides the electroweak bosons the @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks are involved . at the lhc",
    "this is often a difficult case due to the large backgrounds to the processes with @xmath4 and @xmath3 in the final state and/or due to the negligible @xmath4 and @xmath3 luminosities in @xmath5 collisions .",
    "however , the mixing of the vector resonances with the electroweak gauge bosons generates interactions of the new resonances to the fermions of lighter generations .",
    "although these interactions are suppressed by the mixing factors , the processes enabled by them have the advantage of higher parton luminosities and more favorable final state topologies , on the other hand .    in the next section",
    "we briefly introduce our effective lagrangian . in the following section we present results of our analysis . in conclusions",
    "we summarize our findings and outline the prospective steps of this investigation .",
    "our lagrangian is based on the non - linear callan - coleman - wess - zumino lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this approach was applied in formulating the so - called bess ( breaking electroweak symmetry strongly ) model ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) which pioneered the use of the hls approach to the effective description of new resonances formed by new strong interactions related to the esb .",
    "the bess model considered in the literature possesses the @xmath6-to - fermion coupling inter - generation universality @xcite which leads to stringent limits on these couplings from the existing measurements of the sm parameters . in an attempt to reflect the speculations about a special role of the top quark ( or the third quark generation ) in the mechanism of esb we modify the fermion sector by considering no direct interactions of @xmath6 to the fermions other than @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath7 symmetry does not allow us to disentangle the @xmath6-to-@xmath8 coupling from the @xmath6-to-@xmath9 one .",
    "however , it can be done in the case of right fermions .",
    "we do it and to simplify the numerical analysis of the model we turn off completely the direct interaction of @xmath6 to @xmath10 .",
    "the full form of our lagrangian can be found in @xcite . here",
    ", we show only the part responsible for interactions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks to the new vector resonances as well as non - sm interactions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 to the sm gauge bosons @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . as a consequence of turning off the @xmath6-to-@xmath10 coupling neither @xmath14 directly couples to the charged @xmath6-resonance , as can be seen in ( [ lrhor ] ) .",
    "the measurement of @xmath15 vertex constrains the @xmath6-to-@xmath8 coupling to relatively small values .",
    "however , when the disentangling is applied the measurement does not limit the @xmath6-to-@xmath14 interaction . for the low - energy limits on the model parameters ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we test the model when the mass of the neutral @xmath6-resonance is @xmath16  tev . depending on the model parameters @xmath17 decays predominantly through one or more of the following three channels : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",

    "at the same time though , these will be the channels with the richest and the most complicated backgrounds to deal with .",
    "the leptonic channels exhibit lesser event yield and lesser sensitivity . on the other hand , they provide cleaner signal and easily detectable particles , like muons .",
    "thus , when selecting the most appropriate channels for probing our model it has to be a tradeoff between advantages and disadvantages of the both worlds .",
    "in addition , many of the channels displayed in table [ tab : afterdecay ] can be combined to reach higher statistics and/or complementary information on the properties of the model .",
    "with the start of the lhc new era in attacking the question of the esb mechanism begins . in this paper",
    "we have investigated the potential of the lhc processes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , to probe a new vector @xmath2 triplet which might exist as a part of new physics responsible for esb and , as far as fermions are concerned , it interacts directly to the third quark generation only .",
    "it is possible that new physics behind esb can be effectively described by the hls approach .",
    "then the mixing of the vector resonances with the electroweak gauge bosons induces also interactions of @xmath6 to lighter sm fermions .",
    "the processes in which @xmath6 interacts only to quarks of the third generation should be more sensitive to new physics than those which run through @xmath6-to - light - fermion vertices .",
    "however , at the lhc the former processes are often overwhelmed by a huge gluon - gluon background .",
    "we have seen this in the case of @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we have demonstrated that also the processes where @xmath6 couples to the light quarks in protons have a significant potential to distinguish our model from the light higgs sm .",
    "we have calculated the statistical significance of the model signal for various decay channels of the final states . however , to decide whether and which of these channels can recognize the model at the lhc the further analysis , which would include the study of backgrounds and the detector reconstruction efficiency , is necessary .",
    "this is out of the scope of this paper , though .",
    "the results in this paper should help decide which of the processes are the best candidates for such further analyses ."
