    "recently a new dimension has been added to scanning squid measurements : scanning squid susceptometry @xcite has enabled spatially resolved measurements of superconducting penetration depths @xcite , the observation of spontaneous persistent currents in single mesoscopic normal rings @xcite , and measurements of fluctuations in single mesoscopic superconducting rings @xcite .",

    "they associated these stripes with twin boundaries in the superconductor , for a number of reasons : 1 ) the stripe spacings and orientation were consistent with optical and x - ray observations of stripes in the same @xcite and similar @xcite samples .",
    "2 ) the stripes were only observed for underdoped samples , which undergo a tetragonal to orthorhombic crystal structure transition and therefore have twins , but not for optimally doped or overdoped samples .",
    "3 ) the stripes changed position when the samples were warmed above the tetragonal - orthorhombic transition temperature , but not when the sample was only warmed above the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "further , it was observed that vortices did not pin on the stripes , and that when dragged using either a squid sensor , or a magnetic force microscope tip , the vortices did not cross the stripes .",
    "enhanced diamagnetic susceptibility and enhanced critical temperatures associated with twinning have been reported previously from bulk measurements of several elemental superconductors @xcite .",
    "the observation of stripes in susceptibility is quite interesting qualitatively , because it indicates that the superconductivity is different on the twin boundaries than in the bulk in these novel superconductors .",

    "these energies are much larger than @xmath116 .",
    "these are very rough estimates , because it may well be that the sheet width is much smaller than the penetration depth , in which case much of the vortex field energy is outside of the sheet .",
    "we estimate from dragging experiments with an mfm tip that a force of 40 pn at 5k and 6pn at 14k was not enough to make a vortex cross a sheet . using @xmath14 as a characteristic length , the maximum and minimum excess vortex energies on the sheet correspond to forces @xmath117 of @xmath118 , easily large enough to explain the inability to drag vortices across the twin boundaries .",
    "subsequent to the work of kalisky _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , prozorov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite noted an enhancement of the critical current of slightly underdoped single crystals of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 , which they associated with twin boundaries .",
    "the measurements of kalisky _ et al .",
    "_ provide two mechanisms for this critical current enhancement : 1 ) enhanced superfluid density along the twin boundaries provides channels with enhanced depairing current densities , and 2 ) the enhanced superfluid densities in the twin boundaries provides barriers to transverse vortex motion .",
    "our modeling shows that the latter effect can be substantial .",
    "in conclusion , we have used finite element methods to numerically solve maxwell s and london s equations for the problem of enhanced susceptibility from a narrow sheet of superconductor with reduced penetration depth embedded in a bulk superconductor in a geometry appropriate for scanning squid susceptometry measurements .",
    "we find good agreement between our modeling and experiment for the lineshape for cross - sections across stripes in enhanced susceptibility measurements on underdoped samples of the pnictide superconductor ba-122 . by scaling our simulations and comparing the results with experiment we obtain estimates of the enhanced cooper pair sheet density on the sheet .",
    "the barrier energies and forces we estimate are large enough to explain the observed lack of pinning on the sheets , and the experimental inability to drag vortices across the sheets .",
