    "<S> the electronic properties of monolayer phosphorene are exotic due to its puckered structure and large intrinsic direct band gap . </S>",
    "<S> we derive and discuss its band structure in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> further , we evaluate the magneto - optical hall and longitudinal optical conductivities , as functions of temperature , magnetic field , and fermi energy , and show that they are strongly influenced by the magnetic field . the imaginary part of the former and the real part of the latter exhibit regular _ interband _ oscillations as functions of the frequency @xmath0 in the range @xmath1 ev . strong _ intraband _ responses in the latter and week ones in the former occur at much lower frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the magneto - optical response can be tuned in the microwave - to - terahertz and visible frequency ranges in contrast with a conventional two - dimensional electron gas or graphene in which the response is limited to the terahertz regime . </S>",
    "<S> this ability to isolate carriers in an anisotropic structure may make phosphorene a promising candidate for new optical devices . </S>"
