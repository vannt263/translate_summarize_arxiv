    "the spectral properties of complex networks are of great current interest , both for practical applications and from a fundamental point of view @xcite .",
    "the physical phenomena occurring in the network can be described using the operators defined for the network .",
    "for example , the hamiltonian describes electronic excitations in the network of atoms ( nodes ) characterized by energy levels communicating with each other by hopping integrals ( links ) .",
    "the laplacian operator for a set of atoms connected by elastic springs describes vibrational excitations @xcite or transport phenomena , e.g. stochastic diffusion of random - walk type @xcite .",
    "the liouville operator characterizes the spread of epidemics in the network @xcite and the connectivity operator gives knowledge of the network topology @xcite . in the matrix representation ,",
    "these operators are characterized by matrices , the eigenspectrum of which gives rather complete information of e.g. dynamical properties of the network .",
    "the main difficulty in analytical evaluation of the network spectrum is in an inherent disorder incorporated into the network matrices .",
    "this can be topological disorder related to irregular euclidean arrangements of the nodes ( e.g. atoms in liquids and glasses ) and/or disorder in connectivity ( complex networks e.g. of scale - free or small - world type @xcite ) or disorder in parameters associated with the nodes and links ( e.g. mass and force - constant disorder for the vibrational problem on a regular lattice @xcite or substitutional disorder in metallic alloys @xcite ) .",
    "the first task of the spectral analysis is to evaluate the spectral density of the relevant operator for a particular realization of disorder . for an ordered system ,",
    "all the realizations are identical ( zero disorder ) and the spectrum of at least some operators can be easily found . for disordered systems , this is a highly non - trivial problem and can be solved implicitly only for some simple models of local perturbation in a reference not necessarily ordered system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the next task is to perform the averaging over different realizations of disorder ( configurational averaging ) .",
    "the configurationally averaged spectral density can be used then for comparison with the experimentally measured spectrum ( e.g. by inelastic neutron scattering for vibrational excitations @xcite ) or with other observable characteristics ( thermodynamical values such as heat capacity or linear response functions , e.g. the dielectric response function ) .",
    "such a comparison with experimental observables makes sense if the measurable quantity is self - averaging , i.e. if the difference between the mean value of the observable for a particular realization of disorder in a macroscopically large system and the cofigurationally averaged value of this observable tends to zero with increasing system size @xcite .",
    "some of the observables such as thermodynamical characteristics of spin glasses away from the phase transition points and of normal glasses at not very low temperatures are self - averaging . however , some of the observables such as thermodynamical characteristics of spin glasses at criticality @xcite , low temperature electron conductance @xciteand dielectric response in disordered semiconductors with strong disorder @xcite are sample - dependent and thus are not self - averaging .",
    "the spectral density of at least hamiltonians and laplacians exhibits decreasing fluctuations with increasing system size ( even at the localization / delocalization threshold point ) and thus is expected to be a self - averaging characteristic ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this has been seen implicitly in numerous computer simulations of spectral properties of disordered systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and in experiment @xcite .",
    "usually , the ensemble averaging is tackled by means of mean - field theories @xcite with possible use of the replica method @xcite or introducing supersymmetry @xcite but in some cases the  exact  solutions are available .",
    "they are quite rare and the examples are the semicircular spectrum for the fully - connected graph ( fcg ) with random normally distributed node - node interactions @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and lloyd s model for a special type of the on - site disorder and any network topology @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to present a model dealing with the disordered hamiltonians defined on the fcg with a special type of the node - node interactions and a rather general type of the on - site characteristics .",
    "it is possible to find an implicit analytical expression for the spectral density for a particular realization of disorder and then to perform analytically the ensemble averaging of the spectrum of the hamiltonian with precision up to @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the number of nodes in the fcg and thus to demonstrate the self - averaging properties of the spectral density .",
    "the analytical results for the ensemble - averaged spectral density are available due to the existence of an exact solution for the matrix elements of the resolvent operator for a particular realization of disorder .",
    "the general solution is specified and analysed for several particular problems including the electronic and vibrational problems with multiplicative interactions defined on the fcg .",
    "the electronic problem is equivalent to the contact process in the dilute regime and the results can be used for the lower bound estimate of the critical point for the contact process which describes e.g. the spread of epidemics through the network .",
    "the vibrational problem is equivalent to the stochastic transport problem and the results can be used for the investigation of dynamics of information packets propagating through a communication network .",
    "the main analytical results both for the electronic and vibrational problems are supported by direct numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "the formulation of the problem is given in sec .",
    "several simple examples are considered in sec .",

    "the limitations of the approach are discussed in sec .",
    "the conclusions are made in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] and some derivations are presented in appendices  [ app_a ] and  [ app_b ] .",
    "let us consider a fcg containing @xmath1 nodes .",
    "each node @xmath2 is characterized by the parameter @xmath3 ( node bare energy ) and the link between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath4 by parameter @xmath5 ( node - node interaction ) .",
    "then we define an operator @xmath6 (  hamiltonian  ) on this fcg in the following manner , @xmath7 where the self - interaction matrix element @xmath8 is introduced for convenience ( the hamiltonian , in fact , does not depend on it ) .",
    "the tuning parameter @xmath9 gives an opportunity to distinguish between two types of problems : ( i ) electronic - like for @xmath10 and ( ii ) vibrational - like when @xmath11 and all @xmath12 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for vibrational problem , the operator @xmath6 is the hessian operator and its elements obey the sum rule , @xmath13 , which follows from the global translational invariance of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "both the electronic and vibrational problems are usually defined on networks with euclidean topology describing real materials .",
    "below , we consider a fcg and thus the physical meaning of the hamiltonian  ( [ e1_1 ] ) defined on the fcg should be specified .",
    "this can be done by introducing two mappings .",
    "first , the electronic hamiltonian ( @xmath10 ) is equivalent to the liouville operator , @xmath14 , describing the contact process in the dilute regime @xcite .",
    "indeed , the time evolution of the state vector , @xmath15 , for the contact process is governed by the master equation describing the conserved probability flow @xcite , @xmath16 , which can be rewritten in the dilute regime as ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the probability of finding node @xmath2 in an occupied state independent of the occupation of all the other nodes which can be in two states , occupied ( infected ) or unoccupied ( susceptible ) , @xmath19 is the recovery rate for node @xmath2 and @xmath20 is the transmission ( infection ) rate between node @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "the formal solution of eq .",
    "( [ e1_1b ] ) is given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the liouville operator , respectively , which coincides with the hamiltonian  ( [ e1_1 ] ) for @xmath10 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the long - time behaviour of the contact process in the dilute regime is defined by the maximum eigenvalue , @xmath26 , and if @xmath27 then the epidemic goes to extinction and it invades if @xmath28 .",
    "the approximate rate equation  ( [ e1_1b ] ) has been obtained by replacing the term @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the probability for both nodes @xmath2 and @xmath4 to be occupied independent of the state of all the other nodes ) in the exact equation with @xmath31 . such an approximation enhances the transmission of the disease and thus the estimate of the critical point obtained from the solution of the equation , @xmath32 , gives a reliable lower bound estimate of the critical parameter for the contact process meaning that if the disease does not spread in the dilute regime then it certainly does not spread in the system .",
    "this can be practically important for controlling epidemics in disordered systems where the estimate of the exact value of the critical parameter is a rather complicated task @xcite .",
    "the second mapping connects the vibrational problem to the problem of stochastic diffusion through a net .",
    "while the contact process describes a propagation of excitations ( infected nodes ) through the net with a not - conserved number of excitations ( the number of infected nodes changes with time ) then the standard stochastic diffusion deals with propagation of the conserved number of excitations ( diffusing particles ) through the net by means of diffusional jumps ( characterized by the rates @xmath33 ) between the nodes .",
    "the balance equation for stochastic diffusion coincides with eq .",
    "( [ e1_1b ] ) where @xmath19 is replaced by @xmath34 @xcite which reflects the conservation of the number of particles .",
    "therefore , under the assumption of symmetric transition rates , @xmath35 , stochastic diffusion through the network is described by the hamiltonian  ( [ e1_1 ] ) with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath25 .",
    "for complex networks , such as the fcg , the diffusing particles can be associated e.g. with the information packets propagating through the communication network @xcite",
    ". the quantity of interest can be e.g. the return probability of the diffusing particle to the starting place , @xmath36 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of our analysis is to find the eigenspectrum of hamiltonian  ( [ e1_1 ] ) defined on the fcg .",
    "in the site ( node ) basis , the hamiltonian matrix is fully dense and , for the general case of arbitrary parameters @xmath37 and @xmath5 , its diagonalization is not a trivial task and the solution is not currently known .",
    "however , for the classical case of a random matrix belonging to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble , when the off - diagonal ( diagonal ) elements are independent and normally distributed ( with variance doubled for diagonal elements ) , the configurationally averaged spectrum of semicircular shape can be evaluated analytically ( with errors of @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "one of the key features of the matrices belonging to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble is the statistical independence of the matrix elements .",
    "below , we suggest another class of real symmetric matrices for which the spectral density can be found for a particular realization of disorder and then the ensemble averaging can be performed analytically .",
    "these are matrices with a particular ( polynomial ) type of the node - node interactions : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a @xmath40-dimensional row - vector , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a real symmetric @xmath43 matrix of interaction coefficients , so that @xmath44 is a symmetric polynomial form of order @xmath45 with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , e.g. @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the values of @xmath46 are independent random variables characterized , in general , by different probability distribution functions , @xmath50 .",
    "the order of interaction , @xmath40 , is supposed to be much less than the number of nodes in the system , @xmath51 .",
    "the diagonal elements , @xmath3 , in such matrices are also random independent variables distributed according to the probability distribution functions , @xmath52 .",
    "the probability distributions @xmath50 and @xmath52 are assumed to have all finite moments unless it is stated differently .",
    "we demonstrate below that the matrix elements of the resolvent ( green s function ) operator , @xmath53 , defined by the equation , @xmath54 , can be found exactly for the interactions given by eq .",
    "( [ e1_2 ] ) .",
    "this means , that the density of states ( dos ) , @xmath55 , is available for a particular realization of disorder according to the following identity @xcite , @xmath56 due to the availability of the analytical expression for @xmath55 , its configurational averaging , @xmath57 , can also be undertaken analytically by means of the following integration ( for @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 where @xmath3 are the eigenvalues ( eigenenergies ) of the hamiltonian .",
    "before considering the general case of the polynomial node - node interactions  ( [ e1_2 ] ) , we present , first , three simple examples where the exact solution of the problem is available .",
    "these examples are for ( i ) the ideal fcg , ( ii ) the binary fcg and ( iii ) lloyd s model defined on the fcg . in all cases , the biological ( epidemiological ) applications of the results are discussed .",

    "[ f1](a ) .",

    "principle , @xmath67 , meaning that the interactions do not change the total bare energy .",

    "indeed , the maximum eigenvalue of the spectrum coincides with the position of the non - degenerate @xmath71-function and is equal to @xmath72 ( bearing in mind that @xmath10 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "the solution of the equation , @xmath75 , gives a standard mean - field estimate for the critical parameter @xmath76 @xcite .",

    "biologically , this means that mixed populations containing two species are most vulnerable to epidemics for equal concentrations of species if these species strongly interact with each other ( in terms of transferring disease ) and if the species do not interact strongly enough then the mixture of species enhances the resistance of the population .",
    "the above estimates hold for the populations of organisms which are able to communicate ( transfer a disease ) to all other members of the population , i.e. for populations having the communication network with the topology of the fcg .",
    "the other assumption is that the transmission rate between two individuals is inversely proportional to the number of individuals in the population .",
    "this is a plausible assumption for migrating individuals when the probability to establish a contact can be proportional to @xmath145 .",
    "it is known that the configurational averaging of the spectral density can be performed analytically for the network of any topology , and thus for the fcg as well , if the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian matrix are distributed according to the cauchy distribution , @xmath146 where @xmath71 is the width of the distribution , and all the relevant node - node interactions are not random , @xmath147 ( lloyd s model @xcite ) .    the diagonal elements of the configurationally - averaged resolvent operator , @xmath148 can be expressed via the resolvent elements for the ideal fcg , @xmath149 , with the argument shifted to the upper half of the complex plane , @xmath150 .",
