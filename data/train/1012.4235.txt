    "a naive lattice discretization of the dirac action leads to the species doubling problem . to avoid this ,",
    "various lattice fermions have been proposed , including the wilson - type , the staggered - type and lattice chiral fermions . among them , most quantitative outputs of finite temperature qcd have been produced with staggered - type lattice quarks because of their relatively cheap simulation costs .",
    "on the other hand , the staggered - type quarks lead to four copies ( `` tastes '' ) of fermions for each flavor in the continuum limit . to remove unwanted three tastes , we usually adopt the `` fourth root procedure '' , i.e.  we replace the quark determinant by its fourth root in the path - integration procedures . since this makes the theory non - local and non - unitary , many theoretical issues emerge @xcite , as intensively discussed in the confinement 8 workshop .",
    "in particular , the universality arguments become fragile due to non - local interactions , and thus , e.g.  we are not fully sure if the rooted staggered quarks have the correct continuum limit , though , so far , no apparent obstacles about the validity of the rooting procedure seem to exist , provided that the continuum extrapolation is done prior to the chiral extrapolation @xcite .    even when we assume that the staggered quarks do have the correct continuum limit of qcd with desired number of flavors , a couple of issues remain on finite lattices .",
    "one of them is the problem of taste violation . the symmetry among tastes in the continuum limit is explicitly broken at finite lattice spacings .",
    "this introduces a systematic uncertainty in the identification of flavors , and we observe different masses for a hadron depending on the combination of tastes .",
    "for the pion , one combination of tastes , the pseudo nambu - goldstone ( png ) pion , leads to the vanishing mass in the chiral limit , but other 15 combinations remain heavy .",
    "although the png pion is customary treated as the pion , heavier pions do contribute to loop diagrams and thus induce lattice artifacts . to reduce the lattice artifacts , various improved actions , including the asqtad , p4 , stout and hisq actions , have been proposed .    because loop diagrams are the leading contributions in many thermodynamic quantities , a good control of the taste violation is important in finite temperature qcd .",
    "in the studies of @xmath2 , the main difference among the staggered - type quark actions seems to be the magnitude of the remaining taste violation : when we adjust the quark mass parameter to have @xmath26 mev at lattice spacings corresponding to @xmath27 mev on @xmath15 lattices , the masses for the heavy pions are around 400 - 600 ( asqtad ) , 300 - 500 ( stout ) and 200 - 400 mev ( hisq ) , respectively .",
    "the p4 is slightly worse than the asqtad .",
    "therefore , the p4 and asqtad suffers from severer lattice artifacts than the stout and hisq .",
    "the overall effects of heavy pions in the loop diagrams may be measured by a root mean squared ( rms ) mass of pions @xmath28 . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tc1 ] , the asqtad data is shown to be well reproduced by the stout quark action by adjusting @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this explains the larger @xmath2 with the p4 and asqtad actions at @xmath20  8 .",
    "while the major part of the discrepancy is explained by the taste violation , the sensitivity of the determination of @xmath2 on the operator , observed with the stout quark , is not confirmed by other quarks yet .    in all of these studies ,",
    "the physical point is identified by the png pion mass .",
    "the success of the rms pion mass suggests that it is more appropriate to consult the rms hadron masses to judge the location of the physical point for thermodynamic quantities .",

    "<S> lattice qcd is a powerful basis to investigate thermodynamic properties of the quark matter around the deconfinement transition temperature directly from the first principles of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> there were quite a few big advances in finite temperature qcd on the lattice made in the last years .    because the @xmath0 quark mass is comparable with the qcd scale @xmath1 and thus the transition temperature , it is important to incorporate the @xmath0 quark dynamically for quantitative predictions . </S>",
    "<S> large - scale simulations in 2 + 1 flavor qcd with various improved staggered quark actions have now been started to produce results for various thermodynamic quantities which are extrapolated to the continuum limit at around physical quark masses . at the same time , the theoretical uneasiness with staggered quarks motivated several groups to accelerate studies with wilson - type quarks and with lattice chiral quarks . </S>",
    "<S> i review these recent developments in finite temperature lattice qcd , concentrating on the topics of the phase structure and the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite for more discussions . </S>"
