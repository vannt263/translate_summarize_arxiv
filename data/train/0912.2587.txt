    "driven lattices were intensively studied experimentally with respect to the so - called phenomenon of the bloch band collapse @xcite .",
    "this term comes from the theoretical prediction for the width of the quasienergy bloch band , which can take zero values at certain values of the driving amplitude @xcite .",
    "this effect is also present in driven tilted lattices if the driving frequency is commensurate to the bloch frequency , defined by the tilt @xcite . in this work we revisit the problem of band collapse in driven tilted lattices , focusing on the role of interactions .",
    "the second fundamental problem we address in this paper is the interaction - induced destruction of the wannier - stark localization .",
    "it is known that for vanishing inter - atomic interactions the eigenfunctions of an atom in a tilted lattice are localized wannier - stark states and , hence , any ( initially ) localized wave - packet remains localized during time evolution .",
    "it was argued recently @xcite that , for finite interactions , the time evolution of the wave - packet may be unbounded .",
    "it should be stressed from the very beginning that this regime requires weak static forces , not easily accessible in a laboratory experiment . in the opposite limit of a strong static force , the wave - packet dynamics",
    "is always bounded , as it has already confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "a new generation of the cited experiment @xcite allows to enter the regime of weak static forces by using an additional periodic driving @xcite .",

    "the particle dynamics is a bloch oscillation ( bo ) with frequency @xmath14 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the character of these oscillations crucially depends on the type of initial conditions .",

    "this observation helps to understand the limit @xmath20 , where the wave - packet spreads ballistically with a width @xmath10 obeying the equation @xmath21 note that the rate of ballistic spreading is inversely proportional to the initial width @xmath22 .    in the case of incoherent initial conditions ( [ 3b ] )",
    "the bloch dynamics corresponds to a so - called breathing mode , where @xmath23 and the wave - packet width oscillates as @xmath24 the @xmath25 limit of this equation gives @xmath26 where the long time limit is independent of @xmath22 .",

    "one can distinguish several stages : the initial short - time dynamics corresponds to the single - particle bo , where a packet of interacting atoms follows the trajectory ( [ 5a ] ) .",
    "this single - particle regime changes to the regime of dynamical instability ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) at @xmath40 , when the mean quasimomentum crosses the first quarter of the brillouin zone . as a result",
    "the wave packet become scrambled ,  a process which can be viewed as a formation of unstable bright solitons , colliding with each other . during the next stage these solitons ` get thermalized ' and the time - evolution of the site populations @xmath8 becomes a random process .",
    "these chaotic oscillations of the number of atoms in any given well is a precondition for the subdiffusive spreading of the atomic cloud predicted in ref .",

    "we would like to comment on the relation between the mean - field treatment of the system , used throughout the paper , and the microscopic description based on the many - body hamiltonian . with respect to bo this problem",
    "was addressed in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "an important conclusion one draws from these studies is that the discussed subdiffusive dynamics corresponds to an _",
    "incoherent _ evolution of the single - particle density matrix .",
    "( typically coherence of an initial bec state is completely lost after the first 1 - 3 bloch cycles . )",
    "thus , when addressing the problem of subdiffusive spreading , one can use an incoherent initial state from the very beginning . in other words ,",
    "the type of initial conditions affects only the transient short - time dynamics , while the long - time asymptotic dynamics is universal ( see lower panel in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "because the case of a completely incoherent initial packet ( [ 3b ] ) has certain advantages from the theoretical and numerical points of view , in what follows we shall mainly use these initial conditions .     for @xmath38 ( solid line ) and @xmath41 (",

    "[ fig4 ] show the behavior of the quantity ( [ 2 ] ) for @xmath41 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the initial jump in the wave - packet width is due to the single - particle dynamics , where the maximal packet spreading scales as @xmath45 .",

    "for a large @xmath30 , where the dynamics of the site populations is fully chaotic , the increment @xmath49 approaches the predicted value @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness , this subsection discusses the case @xmath51 , which requires a separate consideration . indeed , for @xmath52 and @xmath53 the mean - field dynamics of the system is chaotic @xcite .",
    "then , after 1 - 3 bloch cycles , the system forgets about its initial state and enters the universal asymptotic regime of subdiffusive wave - packet spreading .",

    "it is found that in the case of a wide coherent wave - packet the repulsive interaction _ enhances _ the interaction - free slow expansion ( [ 4a ] ) .",

    "the reason for this is that the effective model focuses on super bo and overlooks ordinary bo , which appears to be important specifically at exact resonance . in what follows",
    "we analyze this situation in some more detail .",
