    "the hubble deep field ( williams 1996 ) affords us an unprecedented view of the optical sky at small angular scales and faint flux levels .",
    "it thus allows us to study faint ( and presumably high redshift ) galaxies without complicating field crowding effects caused by comparatively poor seeing in ground - based faint galaxy studies ( tyson 1995 ) .",
    "preliminary results ( giavalisco 1996 ) show that source counts in the hdf continue to rise as a power law to the completeness limit of the data .",
    "such an effect may be due to ever larger numbers of galaxies at fainter flux levels",
    ". however , it may also be due to the increasingly clumpy appearance of galaxies at high redshift , which can confuse source detection algorithms into counting parts of each physically distinct galaxy as several faint sources .    to test this possibility ,",
    "we consider how redshift effects can lead to over - counting of whole sources in a deep field like the hdf .",
    "@xmath7-correction and surface - brightness dimming tend to enhance the relative prominence uv bright and compact objects , such as active star - forming regions ( oconnell & marcum 1996 ) .",
    "if the enhancement is sufficient , several star - forming regions occurring in a single galaxy will produce the appearance of several small sources separated by an angular scale comparable to the size of a normal galaxy .    in the later sections of the paper , we use two different statistics to test the extent to which hdf source counts reflect the subdivision of galaxies .",
    "these tests exploit the weak dependence of angular size on redshift @xmath8 at @xmath3 .",
    "since galaxies of present day size ( @xmath9 ) remain resolved at all redshifts in the hdf ( peebles 1993 ) , we can compare the physical separations and sizes of objects in the hdf to those of galaxies in the low - redshift universe .    in section  4 , we discuss the two - point angular correlation function @xmath10 of hdf sources .",
    "considerable correlations may be expected for physical scales @xmath11 if many galaxies in the field break up into multiple giant hregions in the source catalogs .    in section  5 ,",
    "we present number - magnitude relations derived from our source catalogs , which show a smooth increase to the completeness limit , with a flatter faint - end slope than in deep ground - based images , and a rough relation @xmath12 , consistent with the hypothesis that many of the faintest images are parts of larger objects .",
    "two redshift effects play an important role in the appearance of very deep fields .",
    "first , the redshift moves the ultraviolet rest - frame light into the optical , so that rest - frame uv - bright objects will be selected over optically bright objects .",
    "schade ( 1995 ) have found that in up to one - third galaxies with @xmath13 , compact blue components dominate the blue light . in such galaxies",
    ", active star - formation is occurring .",
    "abraham ( 1996 ) and clements and couch ( 1996 ) have found the trend toward increasingly blue asymmetric objects to be even more pronounced in the hdf , where yet higher redshifts ( @xmath14 ) bring ever harder rest - frame uv emission into optical bands . moreover , many spectroscopically confirmed high redshift objects in the hdf display noticeable asymmetry and multiple structure .",
    "a nice collection of such objects can be found in figure  2 of steidel ( 1996 ) .",
    "second , compact high redshift objects can appear more prominently than diffuse objects if their angular size is smaller than the point - spread function .",
    "the @xmath15 bolometric surface brightness dimming of resolved sources is less significant for such compact sources : the spreading of light rays is inconsequential if they never spread into more than one psf .",
    "this could lead to a maximum @xmath16 relative enhancement of compact sources over resolved , diffuse sources . also , the actual physical distance changes little beyond redshift @xmath17 , so that a true point source would suffer little @xmath18 dimming .",
    "giant hregions , which have sizes of 0.1 to @xmath2 , ( hodge 1993 ) , remain marginally unresolved by hst , and are thus sufficiently compact for surface brightness dimming to be diminished .",
    "steidel ( 1996 ) , and cowie ( 1996 ) have shown that many sources in the hdf have redshifts @xmath19 ; these could produce a 2 magnitude relative enhancement of compact sources over diffuse sources .    both of these factors work to enhance the prominence of compact star - forming regions in a very deep field such as the hubble deep field .",
    "we retrieved the hdf version 2 images and version 1 object catalogs from the space telescope science institute ( williams 1996 ) .",
    "we found that the catalog contained spurious faint sources near the margins of the large , bright ( nearby ) sources .",
    "this created an overabundance of very close pairs , which artificially increases the angular correlation function at small scales .",
    "we therefore created a new catalog , using the _ daofind _ algorithm to identify objects in deep images formed by averaging the @xmath20 and @xmath21 frames .",
    "this algorithm looks for peaks in the image after bandpass spatial filtering ; the filter is a truncated lowered gaussian with breadth comparable to the point - spread function ( psf ) . _",
    "daofind _ detected a total of 2817 objects in the central @xmath22 regions of three wide - field chips .",
    "the bandpass filtering helps control both random noise and spurious detections in the wings of very bright sources .",
    "however , it may also wash out object pairs with separations below about @xmath0 , and appears to detect subgalaxian features in some foreground galaxies . to lessen this effect",
    ", we masked out sources brighter than magnitude 23.5 before running our detection algorithms .",
    "one may compute the two - point angular correlation function by comparing the number of data pairs at given angular separation to the number of simulated random ( window ) pairs at the same separation .",
    "we thus populated the survey area with @xmath23 random points and computed the distribution of pairs of data objects with data objects @xmath24 , data objects with window objects @xmath25 , and window objects with window objects @xmath26 .",
    "this allowed us to compute ( as hamilton 1993 ) the angular correlation for each of the three hdf fields ( wfc chips ) as @xmath27 because the comoving volume of the hdf sample is dominated by @xmath3 , most objects in the catalog are at high redshift . for reference ,",
    "we have used two methods to select higher redshift objects in the catalog .",
    "the first , from steidel ( 1996 ) , measures spectral curvature between filters to find `` uv dropout '' objects , in which the lyman-@xmath28 break has entered the bluest filter . for the hdf filter set , this happens at redshift @xmath29 .",
    "steidel et al ( 1996 ) find that a useful cut is @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "we developed a second , similar cut based changing spectral slope , using the filter selection information provided by stsci ( 1995 ) , their table 3 ; this cut prefers objects with redshift @xmath31 .",
    "any color - based selection criterion ought to place physically associated objects into the same bin , since such objects presumably have similar evolutionary histories and hence colors .",
    "we have plotted in figure 1 the angular correlations yielded by the objects meeting various selection criteria . in each panel",
    ", the lighter curves represent the correlations from each of the three wfc chips , while the heavier curve is the mean of those three .",
    "the one - sigma error bars are derived from comparison of the three values for the individual chips .",
    "the first two rows gives the correlations for the above - mentioned cuts as applied to our catalog .",
    "the third row , for comparison , contains a catalog from couch ( 1996 ) with the steidel ( 1996 ) cut applied .",
    "the first ( leftmost ) column of figure 1 shows the correlations for the higher color - redshift objects ; the second column shows the correlations for the lower redshift objects ; the third column shows the cross - correlations between the high and low color - redshift objects .",
    "first , we examine the cross - correlation .",
    "if the color cuts effectively sort physically associated objects at different redshift , there should be little or no correlation between the high and low cuts .",
    "indeed , the cross - correlation signal is very low , and consistent with zero in the first two rows ( our catalog ) .",
    "we thus surmise that these cuts , applied to our catalog , rarely admit physically associated objects into different bins .    the high correlations and low cross - correlations in figure 1",
    "tell us that both moderate and high color - redshift species must exhibit strong correlation on scales of less than one arcsecond .",
    "this is to be expected at low to moderate redshift if the cataloging scheme records subgalaxian structure , such as hregions and bulges .",
    "when one overplots our catalog on the images themselves , one sees that such structure is detected within galaxies as individual objects .",
    "some of these galaxies have many detections within them .",
    "these objects , visibly within single galaxies , likely dominate the correlation signal at low redshift .",
    "however , at higher redshift , the underlying galaxy may vanish due to @xmath7-correction and surface brightness dimming , so that only the compact and uv - bright star - forming regions are left .",
    "many object pairs and groups are visible in the images . we infer that these pairs and groups are in fact objects within the same physically associated galaxy , just as the hregions at low redshift are in the same galaxy .    for this to be so",
    ", the correlation scales must correspond to physical scales which allow detected objects to fit within a single galaxy .",
    "peebles ( 1993 ) demonstrates that for most cosmologies the angular size of @xmath9 galaxies at @xmath32 is @xmath33-@xmath34 arcseconds ( @xmath35 , any @xmath36 ) , so that correlations below this scale indicate counting of subgalaxian objects . efstathiou ( 1991 ) has shown that projection effects are unlikely to contaminate correlations , so that small - scale correlation is likely due to physical association of objects .",
    "the increasing correlation down to @xmath0 implies that many detected objects have sizes @xmath37 , which is comparable to the expected size ( @xmath38 ) of a @xmath39 hregion at @xmath3 .",
    "we checked this by computing petrosian radii ( with @xmath40 , following the kron [ 1995 ] notation ) for the catalog objects , which showed a broad peak at about @xmath41 .",
    "if we now compare the high redshift correlations to low redshift correlations in the first two rows of figure 1 , we see that both show substantial correlation strength on sub - arcsecond scales .",
    "in addition , the high redshift bin shows a substantially stronger correlation around @xmath0 .",
    "the statistical significance of this increase ( about one sigma ) is debatable , though a clear excess is visible in all three chips . in all three chips , the correlation appears to turn over at half an arcsecond in the second column , but not in the first .",
    "this excess correlation on very small scales may be due to the increasing prominence of very young , compact , and hot star - forming regions at higher redshifts , where the wien cut - off begins hiding a type and cooler stars ( fitzpatrick , 1996 ) .",
    "we have confirmed that the correlation persists among a pure high redshift sample by measuring the correlation functions of both the high-@xmath8 candidates and the spectroscopically confirmed high-@xmath8 sources of steidel et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "the peak correlation strengths were @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "all of these arguments suggest numerous subgalaxian hregions in our catalog , both at high @xmath44 and lower redshifts . at low redshifts , the parent galaxies are visible in the images , but at high redshift , the parent galaxy is most often invisible , which might lead one to think navely that the objects are physically separate , and overcount `` galaxies . ''    finally ,",
    "we compare correlations derived from our catalog to those derived from the couch ( 1996 ) catalog , which he created using the _ sextractor _ ( bertin 1994 ) package .",
    "we have found that his catalog does not often overcount foreground substructure , as does ours .",
    "correlations in the two catalogs agree at high redshift , but disagree significantly in the lower redshift sample .",
    "the smaller correlation at low redshift and small angular scales in his catalog evinces the difference between our multiple counting of foreground subgalaxian structure and his proper counting of one count per one foreground galaxy .",
    "however , the agreement on the excess sub - arcsecond correlation at high redshift suggests that both schemes overcount substructure at high redshift .",
    "couch s sextractor catalog also shows nonzero correlation at large angular separations ( @xmath45@xmath46 ) , absent in our catalog .",
    "this is probably due to the increased sensitivity of sextractor s thresholding to faint objects in the wings of bright objects .",
    "_ daofind s _ high - pass filtering is less sensitive to such objects .    as a final test , we made percentile cuts according to angular size ( intensity weighted second moments , @xmath47 and @xmath48 from the couch catalog ) .",
    "we found dramatically enhanced sub - arcsecond correlation in small objects .",
    "for the smallest quartile ( @xmath49 ) , we found correlation of @xmath50 at @xmath0 ; for the smallest 10% of objects ( @xmath51 ) , we found correlation of @xmath52 at @xmath0 as visible in the fourth row of figure 1 .",
    "this sharp , if uncertain , enhancement demonstrates that the bulk of the correlation is , in fact , coming from the smallest objects , in agreement with the hypothesis that the correlation derives from small , subgalaxian objects .",
    "we present number - magnitude relations for both unsmoothed and smoothed @xmath21 images in figure 2(a ) .",
    "the solid histograms represent no smoothing , the dashed histogram @xmath53 smoothing , and the dotted histogram @xmath54 smoothing .",
    "no effort has been made to correct the observed counts for incompleteness or crowding effects , and the decrease in the counts beyond @xmath55 30th magnitude is almost certainly due to incompleteness .",
    "object fluxes in @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 apertures were used to generate the magnitudes at the three smoothing scales .",
    "we chose aperture photometry for its robustness in cases where multiple sources overlap on the sky .",
    "the resulting number - magnitude relation rises monotonically to a completeness limit around ab magnitude @xmath59 in the @xmath21 filter . at the faint end",
    ", it has a slope somewhat shallower than that seen in ground - based r band counts , and substantially shallower than in ground - based u counts ( tyson 1995 ) .",
    "the number - magnitude slope for the unsmoothed image catalogs steepens at the bright end , which can be understood as a side effect of using small aperture photometry .",
    "the smoothed catalogs , on the other hand , show a continued power law behavior to the brightest objects in the hdf ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the slope and normalization of the counts are consistent with ground - based counts for the overlap region ( @xmath61 ) ( tyson 1995 ) .",
    "we have also plotted the @xmath62 line in figure  3 .",
    "this line separates slopes with convergent and divergent total flux at faint magnitudes , and is a good match to ground - based r band data for @xmath63 .",
    "it is also the number - magnitude slope expected if standard objects are broken into fragments and then counted as sources ( with equal probability for any number of fragments , up to some large maximum ) .",
    "counts from the unsmoothed data match this slope for @xmath64 .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the number - magnitude relation for only the high - color redshift ( using the steidel cut ) .",
    "the results here are not very different , other than zero - point , from the relation for all sources , which again suggests that we are seeing a similar population at high and moderate redshift .",
    "comparing the results for @xmath53 and @xmath54 smoothing to those for no smoothing , we detect two and four times fewer objects , and the completeness limit worsens by about two and four magnitudes . this shows the deleterious effects of field - crowding in low - resolution fields , where galaxian images begin to overlap in the poor seeing .",
    "the counts in the smoothed fields are less likely to overcount substructure , but more likely to miss faint objects within the seeing discs of bright objects .",
    "therefore , care must be taken when comparing ground - based deep counts with counts in the hubble deep field .",
    "we have cataloged objects in the hubble deep field in a way that is less prone to spurious detections than were previous efforts . from the catalog ,",
    "we have drawn the angular correlation for high and low color - redshift subsets using two different cuts . we have found similar correlations down to @xmath53 for both subsets .",
    "since the signal is ostensibly dominated by hregions in the lower redshift subset , we surmise that that signal is also dominated by subgalaxian structure in the higher redshift subset .",
    "we have compared our results to the correlation derived from an independent catalog ( couch 1996 ) which appears not to over - count nearby objects . as expected",
    ", there is less correlation in the lower redshift subset of this catalog than in ours .",
    "however , at higher redshift , the correlations of the catalogs agree rather well , so that both of our catalogs include as distinct objects what are likely subgalaxian structure at high redshift .",
    "a dramatic increase in sub - arcsecond correlation occurs in the subset of objects with the smallest angular sizes , in agreement that the correlated objects are small , subgalaxian objects .",
    "the qualitative difference between deep space- and ground - based optical data is due to a conspiracy of scales . because the characteristic angular sizes of galaxies at redshifts @xmath65 correspond to the @xmath66 angular resolution of ground - based data , deep optical counts from the ground will see galaxy - sized objects as single peaks . at the higher resolution available from space ,",
    "substructure becomes detectable in galaxies at any redshift , and overcounting becomes a possibility .",
    "we have also computed the magnitude - radius relation , which shows that a large fraction of the objects have characteristic sizes around @xmath41 , corresponding to scale lengths @xmath67 , typical of both high redshift galaxian scale - lengths and diameters of giant star - forming regions .",
    "the peak at @xmath41 allows several objects to fit into a single galaxy , as one requires for the subgalaxian structure scenario .",
    "the number - magnitude relations for our catalogs show convergent flux in all bands with @xmath12 as expected for images broken into fragments .",
    "this physically reassuring result differs from the nave extrapolation of ground - based number - magnitude relations for u , b , and possibly r bands .",
    "we find that after we smoothed the data , the counts drop dramatically at the faint end .",
    "this illustrates how seeing reduces the faint counts in ground - based work , diluting isolated faint objects below detection thresholds while blurring substructures in brighter galaxies together to form single peaks .",
    "the statistical tests presented herein suggest that the most distant objects in the hdf must be some combination of galaxies and star - forming fragments , a distinction increasingly hard to draw in deep fields .",
    "this supports our hypothesis that ultraviolet bright and compact star - forming regions contribute substantially to the flux , and increasingly to the number counts , we receive from high redshift samples .",
