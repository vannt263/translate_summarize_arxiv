    "the investigation of the spatially separated electrons and holes in the coupled quantum wells ( cqw ) is initially motivated by expecting that the electron - hole pairs forming a long - living bound state , namely exciton , can experience the bose - einstein condensation @xcite . in such systems the electrons",
    "are located within one layer of the cqw while the holes , which are spatially separated from the electrons , are located in the other layer .",
    "the interest in the cqw has greatly grown in the recent years due to the increasing ability to manufacture the high quality quantum well structures in which electrons and holes are confined in the different spatial regions between which the tunneling can be made negligible @xcite .",
    "as early as decade and a half the existence of an electron - hole condensate phase in the cqw was predicted using the variational approach lozovik - berman1996 .",
    "recently , the effect of the many - body coulomb correlations in the cqw on the ground state of the electron - hole system is investigated in ref .",
    "the layers of the cqw are supposed so thin that the in - layer charge motion is a 2d one . in paper@xcite , the compressibility is found to be _ positive _ if the initial layer charge density @xmath1 the critical value @xmath0 being specified by the physical parameters of the cqw .",
    "the positive compressibility means the instability resulting in the formation of the inhomogeneous system which comprises the liquid electron - hole drops .",
    "also , it was found in ref.@xcite that the homogeneous exciton gas phase possesses the higher energy as compared to the inhomogeneous state ( of the same average density ) which involves the electron - hole liquid drops .",
    "alternative scenarios for the formation of the condensed phase in the electron - hole system in the cqw are also considered in various papers , in particular in refs .",
    "@xcite . note that the electron - hole liquid of the same origin as in ref.jetlet was predicted for the conventional 3d - semiconductors in keldysh1 , rice .",
    "the results obtained in ref.@xcite are based on the assumption that each of the layers of the cqw is a many - valley semiconductor .",
    "thus , the every kind of the electrons or the holes is specified by the number of the valley and the spin projection .",
    "let the number of different kind of the electrons as well as the number of different kind of the holes @xmath2 .",
    "two limiting situations are considered in this paper : the inter - layer separation @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the effective bohr radius . in the first case ,",
    "the electron - hole liquid drops are formed which possess the in - layer density @xmath6 . in the second case , @xmath7 these results are obtained using the diagrammatic approach and the following approximation is used . for any order in the coulomb interaction , only the diagrams are held which are of the minimal order in the small parameter @xmath8 in this case , the set of the diagram is that of the rpa kind .",
    "a similar approach was developed in ref.@xcite to justify the formation of the electron - hole liquid drops in conventional 3d - semiconductors .",
    "note that the standard rpa is justified for the high - density electron - hole plasma .",
    "in refs @xcite the rpadiagram approach is based only on the assumption that the electron - hole plasma is many - component .    in the current paper",
    "we predict the instability of the uniform electron - hole system in the cqw for the case @xmath3 in the approximation next beyond to the rpa . for this purpose",
    ", we investigate the pole of the 4-fermion vertex function in the approximation which along with the rpa - kind diagrams takes into account the diagrams of the next order in the parameter @xmath8 it is shown that the instability , connected with the pole of the vertex function , corresponds to the thermodynamical instability induced by the positive compressibility revealed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the result obtained is justified for the many - component system , @xmath9 however , comparing the result found in ref.@xcite ( obtained in the main @xmath10 approximation ) with that found in the current paper ( obtained in the next approximation in the parameter @xmath10 ) manifests that the critical concentration is insensitive to the approximation .",
    "for this reason , one can expect that the instability revealed takes place if the parameter @xmath11 is not very large .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the system of units is used with the effective electron ( hole ) charge @xmath12 the effective electron ( hole ) masses @xmath13 and the planck constant @xmath14 .",
    "then , the effective bohr radius is @xmath15 and the energy is measured in the hartree units @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath17 being the kinetic energy and @xmath18 being the coulomb interaction . in the second quantization one has @xmath19here @xmath20 stands for the electrons , while @xmath21 stands for the holes , @xmath22 labels the kind of the electron or the hole ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the creation and annihilation operators , @xmath25 is the in - layer @xmath26 momentum , and @xmath27 is the area of the layers .",
    "the coulomb interaction in the momentum representation , which is assumed to be independent on the valley , reads @xmath28the fermi momentum and the fermi energy for the electrons and the holes are the same and are equal to @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , @xmath31 being the layer concentration of the electrons or the holes .",
    "it is assumed that the temperature @xmath32 and the concentration @xmath33    let us consider the four - fermion vertex function @xmath34 in the matsubara representation .",
    "the subscripts @xmath35 and @xmath36 label the two input ends .",

    "the notations @xmath37 and @xmath38 are used which determine the input momentums @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the input matsubara frequencies @xmath41 and @xmath42 , while the argument @xmath43 specifies the transfer momentum @xmath44 and the transfer frequency @xmath45 .",
