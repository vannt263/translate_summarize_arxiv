    "this mechanism is physically of the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) type , @xcite but at low doping levels it deviates from the heisenberg form owing to the half - metallic character of the conduction band in the ferromagnetic state.@xcite this non - heisenberg character may be responsible for the peculiar shoulder observed in the @xmath4 curves for gd - doped euo .",

    "the electron doping is introduced within the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) by adding the electron doping concentration @xmath6 to the nuclear charge of the eu atom .    in order to expose the different mechanisms of exchange interaction , we have considered three different models .",

    "is applied to the o @xmath11 states just as in model 1 , but in model 3 this is not done .",

    "table [ vcajij ] lists the important exchange parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ scheme]a for an illustration ) calculated for the three models at zero and 5% electron doping levels , as well as the differences between them .",
    "first , let us comment on the physical meaning of these parameters .",
    "in the linear response method @xcite the exchange parameter for a pair of sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 is defined as the second derivative of the total energy with respect to the angles of rotation of the exchange - correlation fields in the corresponding atomic spheres : @xmath23 . in the lmto setups all sites carry local moments , including o and the empty spheres es .",
    "therefore , one can formally define the pair exchange parameters for the eu - o pairs , eu - es pairs , etc .",
    "table [ vcajij ] lists all such parameters that are not negligibly small in undoped euo ( others are less than 0.01 mev ) . in the doped case a long - range indirect interaction sets in , which will be discussed separately below .",
    "although individual pair parameters for this long - range part are not listed in table [ vcajij ] , it contains the full lattice sum of the eu - eu pair parameters ( @xmath24 ) , as well as the full lattice sum of all pair parameters connecting a given site x to the rest of the lattice ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "note that the exchange parameters are first calculated in reciprocal space and then fourier - transformed to real space .",
    "the lattice sums are thus calculated exactly , without a real - space cutoff .",
    "a sensible effective model of exchange interaction in euo should only include eu spins as dynamical variables .",
    "the small magnetic moments on o are induced by exchange interaction ( and hybridization for model 1 ) with the @xmath3 states , while those on es sites simply reflect the extension of the eu and o orbitals beyond their atomic spheres .",
    "these local moments do not fluctuate independently , but should be assumed to adiabatically follow the fluctuating @xmath3 moments on eu .",
    "we should not , therefore , interpret the exchange parameters connecting o and es to other sites as having direct physical meaning , but these interactions should contribute to the true effective eu - eu exchange parameters . for the estimate of the curie temperature @xmath0 , in the mean - field approximation we should consider the total weiss field acting on a given eu spin .",
    "in doing so , we should exclude the part attributable to the tails of the orbitals on the central eu site itself .",
    "in other words , we should exclude the spurious effects of the orbital `` tails '' being fixed while its `` head '' is rotated , which is what happens , for example , when a eu - o exchange parameter is evaluated using the linear response technique in lmto .",
    "since such parameters ( eu - o and eu - es ) extend only to the nearest - neighbor sites of the given kind , on a crude level we can simply reduce each such parameter by a factor @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of nearest - neighbor eu atoms for site @xmath22 ( which is either o or es ) . for model 1",
    "we can then estimate the `` true '' effective field parameter @xmath28 as @xmath29 mev , which is only slightly smaller than @xmath30 mev .",
    "the classical mean - field estimate of @xmath31 for undoped euo then becomes 140 k ( we use classical mean - field estimates of @xmath0 to facilitate comparison with classical monte carlo results in the following ) .",
    "this value is about twice as large compared to the experimental value .",
    "this overestimation can only partially be attributed to the mean - field approximation , and the remaining error is probably related to the asa .",

    "the eu - o coupling , on the other hand , is only weakly affected .",
    "these features confirm that the dominant part of the ferromagnetic coupling in euo is due to the hybridization of @xmath3 states with the conduction - band eu states .",
    "@xcite note that in ref .",
    "strong antiferromagnetic coupling was found in the open - core approximation , the origin of which is unclear to us .",
    "weak ferromagnetic coupling in our open - core calculations is due to the bloembergen - rowland mechanism,@xcite which involves the hybridization of o states with the empty conduction band .",
    "the downward shift of the o @xmath11 states in model 2 reduces this mechanism compared to model 3 , but it is quite small in both models 2 and 3 .",
    "let us now focus on the effects of electron doping .",
    "it is seen from table [ vcajij ] that the changes in the exchange parameters due to 5% electron doping are quite similar across all three models .",
    "the dominant effect of doping is the introduction of an additional indirect contribution to eu - eu coupling , while the parameters connecting eu to o and es sites are only weakly modified .",

    "@xmath0 saturates as a function of doping unless these dynamical effects are taken into account ; he also suggested that the maximum in @xmath0 found in first - principles calculations of refs .",
    "is due to the use of total energy calculations , which partially take into account the effects of spin disorder .",
    "however , our linear response calculations applied to the ferromagnetic state still produce a maximum in @xmath0 , but only if the @xmath3 electrons are included in the basis set .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the observed maximum in @xmath0 is due to the competition of two exchange mechanisms .",
    "the contribution of indirect exchange mediated by conduction electrons increases monotonically with doping , but the rate of its increase drops near the point where the fermi level reaches the bottom of the minority - spin conduction band . on the other hand , the @xmath1-@xmath2 hopping mechanism , which dominates in pure euo , is suppressed by the filling of the conduction band and by the loss of its spin polarization .",
    "the combination of these two effects leads to a broad maximum in @xmath0 .",
    "as we mentioned above , the strength of the @xmath1-@xmath2 hopping mechanism is overestimated in our calculations , so one may expect that the decline of @xmath0 may also be somewhat overestimated .",
    "so far we have assumed that the exchange interaction may be described by the heisenberg model . however , at low doping concentrations the indirect exchange in euo has a non - heisenberg character due to the half - metallicity of the conduction band above the threshold polarization level .",
    "@xcite in this half - metallic region the effective weiss field no longer depends on the magnetization , which may explain the pronounced shoulder observed in the @xmath4 curve ( see e.  g.  refs .   for recent data on high - quality samples ) .",
    "the effective exchange parameter in the paramagnetic state is larger compared to the ferromagnetic state , and thus the above estimates of @xmath36 should be corrected at low doping levels . to this end , we have calculated the exchange fields as a function of the polarization of the @xmath3 shell in euo at 1% and 3% doping levels .",
    "these calculations were performed for models 2 and 3 by varying the polarization of the open - core @xmath3 shell , but this variation also represents the effects of temperature - dependent magnetization .",

    "on the other hand , the observed activation energy may actually correspond to a different bound state .",
    "a bound magnetic polaron @xcite is a popular candidate , in which the second localized electron aligns its spin parallel to the deeply bound impurity state and polarizes the spins of the eu atoms in its vicinity .",
    "we note , however , that double occupation of @xmath123 center - like impurity states in the paramagnetic state is consistent with the experimental observation that @xmath0 in bulk eu - rich euo samples is not increased compared to its value for pure euo , while even small concentrations of gd enhance it notably .",
    "if bound magnetic polaron is the dominant defect in eu - rich euo , we would expect a @xmath0 enhancement of a magnitude similar to gd doping at approximately double the concentration of o vacancies .",
    "as we argued above , in the dilute limit o vacancies in euo should capture two electrons in the paramagnetic state .",
    "the situation changes at larger vacancy concentrations on the order of a few percent , which can be reached in films .",
    "@xcite compared to the dilute limit , there are two changes : the impurity levels broaden into impurity bands , and the chemical potential is increased unless there are compensating defects .",
    "although the increase of the chemical potential tends to further stabilize the doubly occupied state , the lowest - energy state can now correspond to a fractional occupation of the impurity band .",
    "this is the situation seen in fig .",
    "[ dos]c , where it corresponds to the vacancy concentration of 3.125% .",
    "of course , there should be no metal - insulator transition in this case , and @xmath0 should be significantly increased due both to the filling of the conduction band and to the exchange coupling mediated by the magnetically polarized impurity states , as is usually observed in eu - rich euo films .    in principle , the spin - polarized impurity orbitals could interact directly and order ferromagnetically above the @xmath0 of pure euo .",
    "however , the following considerations show that this interaction is too weak . in order to interact strongly",
    ", two o vacancies must share an eu neighbor , which means they must occupy nearest or next - nearest o sites .",
    "the exchange coupling for such pairs can be estimated as the difference in the exchange - correlation energy @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ev ) on the shared eu atom(s ) for parallel and antiparallel orientations of the impurity spins . at a 3% vacancy concentration ,",
    "the vacancy orbitals carry local moments of about 0.5 @xmath138 ( fig .",
    "[ dos]c ) . taking into account that the weight of the impurity orbital on each neighboring eu atom is about 5.6% ,",
    "the local moment on eu for parallel and antiparallel orientations should be about 0.056 @xmath138 and 0 , respectively , yielding an energy difference of about 1.5 mev .",
    "if the vacancy orbitals are fully spin - polarized ( local moment 1 @xmath138 ) , this difference would be 4 times larger , or about 6 mev . at 3% concentration each vacancy",
    "has a roughly 50% chance of having another vacancy as its first or second neighbor .",
    "thus , even in the mean - field approximation the maximum possible @xmath0 due to this exchange interaction is less than 10 k , which is well below the ordering temperature of pure euo .",
    "thus , we expect that the vacancy orbitals should behave as anderson local moments , and their dominant effect on @xmath0 should be through an enhancement of the exchange coupling between the eu @xmath3 spins that they overlap with .",
    "the local moment on the impurity orbital varies gradually in the whole range of magnetization from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic ( see fig .  [ dos]b and [ dos]c ) , and the impurity band does not become half - metallic at any temperature .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the interaction introduced by these orbitals does not deviate strongly from the heisenberg model .",
    "the magnitude of this interaction will be evaluated in section [ msce : vac ] .    to conclude this section",
    ", we note that filling of the impurity states on o vacancies suggests a possible explanation for the results of the arpes measurements on gd - doped euo , @xcite which showed the transfer of the spectral weight from the electron pockets near x points toward bound states of unknown origin as the system is heated beyond the curie temperature .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that gd - induced o vacancies could be responsible for a defect band contributing the bound states .",
    "our present results not only provide evidence in support of this hypothesis , but also show the possible mechanism of the temperature - dependent spectral weight transfer .",

    "the maximum @xmath0 of approximately 150 k is reached in a broad range of gd concentrations in good agreement with experiments ( see e.  g.  ref .  ) .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that @xmath0 can be further increased in gd - doped euo .",
    "similar to vca , the msce - based mc results should underestimate the rate of increase of @xmath0 at low doping levels due to the neglect of the non - heisenberg character of the indirect exchange .",
    "in gd - doped euo there are two types of magnetic atoms , while in eu - rich euo the eu neighbors of an o vacancy are strongly coupled by the localized state .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine the contributions to the total magnetization coming from these different types of atoms .",
    "[ mcd]a shows the atomic contributions to the total @xmath4 in 15% gd - doped euo for eu and gd atoms .",
    "[ mcd]b provides a similar plot for eu - rich euo with a 1/32 vacancy concentration , sorting out the atomic contribution to @xmath4 of eu atoms that have an o vacancy next to them .",

    "solid lines show the total magnetization . in panel ( b ) the atomic magnetization of the eu neighbors of o vacancies ( denoted eu@xmath59 ) is displayed separately from that of all other eu atoms ( denoted eu@xmath219).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   curves in ( a ) 15% gd - doped , and ( b ) 3.125% eu - rich euo .",

    "( b ) the atomic magnetization of the eu neighbors of o vacancies ( denoted eu@xmath59 ) is displayed separately from that of all other eu atoms ( denoted eu@xmath219).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for gd - doped euo we see that the reduced magnetization of the gd atoms is notably suppressed compared to that of the eu atoms .",
    "this is because the gd - eu exchange coupling is significantly weaker compared to the eu - eu coupling , as mentioned in section [ sec : msce ] .",
    "the difference in the @xmath4 curves for eu and gd atoms could be experimentally verified using an element - specific probe such as nuclear magnetic resonance . as seen in fig .",
    "[ mcd]b , in eu - rich euo there is a large enhancement of the magnetization for eu sites adjacent to o vacancies , which is due to strong exchange coupling mediated by the localized states centered at the vacancies .",
    "the @xmath0 for the chosen vacancy concentration of 3.125% is close to 120 k , which is only achieved at about twice larger gd concentration in gd - doped euo .",
    "thus , the homogeneous enhancement of the exchange interaction due to the filling of the conduction band and inhomogeneous coupling due to localized states at the vacancy sites contribute nearly equally to the enhancement of @xmath0 in eu - rich euo .",
    "several authors observed that the deviations of the @xmath4 curves from the brillouin function with a long `` tail '' extending to higher temperatures is likely due , at least in part , due to the finite magnetic field used in the magnetization measurements.@xcite this feature is readily reproduced in mc simulations with a zeeman field added to msce , as shown in fig .",

    "the field is indicated next to the curves in mev units of maximum zeeman energy per site . for @xmath222 magnetic moment ,",
    "1 mev is equivalent to @xmath223 t.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    overall , our results show that , although on the microscopic level the magnetic interaction in gd - doped and eu - rich euo deviates strongly from the homogeneous electron doping model ( vca ) , this inhomogeneity does not strongly modify the macroscopic magnetic properties such as @xmath218 and @xmath4 .",
    "the observed deviations of the @xmath4 curves from the conventional behavior should therefore be due to other mechanisms . at low concentrations , as noted above , these deviations may be explained by the non - heisenberg character of the indirect exchange in the half - metallic regime.@xcite on the other hand , the observed anomalies at large gd concentrations may be induced by finite external fields used in the measurements,@xcite or may indicate phase separation as suggested in ref .  .",
    "the magnetization curves in eu - rich euo films usually look like a superposition of two separate magnetization curves with different curie temperature , one of which coincides with that of pure euo .",
    "this feature suggests phase separation,@xcite but contrary evidence @xcite shows the need for further investigation .",
    "we have studied the electronic structure , magnetic interaction , and thermodynamic properties of gd - doped and eu - rich euo using first - principles calculations .",
    "homogeneous electron doping of euo , which was modeled in the virtual crystal approximation , leads to a broad maximum in @xmath0 . this maximum is due to the competition between the monotonically increasing indirect exchange contribution and the @xmath1-@xmath2 hopping mechanism , which generates ferromagnetism in pure euo but is suppressed at large doping concentrations .",
    "calculations with variable polarization of the @xmath3 shell reveal a pronounced non - heisenberg character of the indirect exchange interaction at small doping concentrations in agreement with the model of mauger,@xcite which leads to strongly enhanced @xmath0 and an anomaly in the @xmath4 curve .",
    "we have analyzed the electronic structure of isolated gd impurities and o vacancies in euo .",
    "both these defects donate one electron to the conduction band in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "an o vacancy introduces an exchange - split @xmath123 center - like level , which is half - filled in the ground state .",
    "estimates based on the key parameters extracted from our calculations suggest that in the limit of low vacancy concentrations the impurity state should become doubly occupied , assuming that the @xmath3 spins are fully disordered .",
    "this is consistent with the `` he atom model '' of the metal - insulator transition observed in the bulk samples of eu - rich euo @xcite and with no enhancement of @xmath0 in such samples .",
    "however , the estimated 0.05 ev activation energy in the paramagnetic state is too low compared to the transport measurements , and we can not rule out the formation of bound magnetic polarons . at higher vacancy concentrations typical for eu - rich euo films ,",
    "the impurity states broaden into impurity bands , the upper one of which remains partially filled in the paramagnetic state .",
    "the impurity states behave as anderson local moments in this regime .",
    "this is consistent with the observed strong enhancement of @xmath0 in eu - rich euo films .",
    "localized states on o vacancies could also provide the bound states observed in arpes in gd - doped euo .",
    "@xcite    to go beyond the homogeneous doping model , we employed a magnetostructural cluster expansion ( msce ) approach , which explicitly includes the effect of local chemical environment on the magnetic interaction . for the case of gd - doped euo we constructed an msce based on the input data from first - principles calculations that covers a wide range of gd concentration of up to 25% . for eu - rich euo",
    ", we set up a simple msce based on the data for one supercell with a single vacancy .",
    "the resulting hamiltonians were used in monte carlo simulations . the curie temperature in gd - doped euo",
    "was found to behave similar to the virtual crystal approximation , exhibiting a maximum as a function of gd concentration .",
    "the results suggest that the intrinsic limit @xcite of @xmath0 in gd - doped euo is approximately 150 k. oxygen vacancies induce a sharper rise in @xmath0 compared to a similar concentration of gd dopants due to the strong exchange coupling of the neighboring eu atoms mediated by the polarized impurity levels .",
    "microscopic inhomogeneity does not lead to any anomalies in the @xmath4 curves , at least in the random alloys that we have considered .",
