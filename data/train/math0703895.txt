    "consider a homogeneous medium of point particles at rest in euclidean space @xmath1 , and a body moving forward through this medium .",
    "the medium is highly rarefied , so that mutual interaction of the particles is neglected .",
    "the interaction of the particles with the body is absolutely elastic . it is required to find a shape of the body that minimizes or maximizes resistance of the medium to its motion .",
    "when thinking of this kind of problems , one can have in mind an artificial satellite of the earth moving on a relatively low ( say , @xmath2 km ) orbit ; one has to _ minimize _ resistance of the rest of atmosphere , or a solar sail ; then one has to _ maximize _ the pressure of the flux of solar photons on the sail .    in order to specify the problem",
    ", one has to describe the body s motion as well as to define the class of admissible bodies . in classes of _ convex",
    "_ bodies with _ translational _ motion , the minimization problem has been extensively studied .",
    "newton @xcite obtained the solution in the class of ( three - dimensional ) convex _ axially symmetric _ bodies of fixed length and width .",
    "since 1993 , there have been obtained many interesting results in classes of convex _ non - symmetric _ bodies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "note that resistance can be written in the form @xmath3 = \\int\\!\\!\\int_d ( 1 + |\\nabla f|^2)^{-1}\\ , dx\\ , dy$ ] , where the function @xmath4 , @xmath5 describes the front part of a convex body . here",
    "the ( orthogonal ) coordinates are chosen in such a way that the body s velocity equals @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the problem amounts to minimization of the functional @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "this approach is not valid , as applied to _",
    "( a body is a bounded connected set with piecewise smooth boundary . )",
    "the reason is that the above formula is not true if particles can hit the body more than once .",
    "in fact , there is no simple analytic formula for resistance in the nonconvex case .    in general it is not easy to calculate resistance even for ( nonconvex ) bodies with well - behaved boundary",
    "; however , usually one can construct a minimizing body or a minimizing sequence of bodies .",
    "in the three - dimensional case infimum of resistance is typically equal to zero @xcite - neighborhood @xcite . ] . on the contrary , in the two - dimensional case infimum of resistance",
    "is positive and usually can be explicitly found @xcite . in higher dimensions , @xmath7 ,",
    "the answer is the same as in the three - dimensional case : infimum of resistance equals zero .",
    "note in passing that the problem of _ maximal _ resistance admits a very simple solution : the front part of the body s surface should be orthogonal to the direction of motion , or should be composed of pieces orthogonal to this direction .",
    "it is also interesting to consider rotational motion of the body .",
    "imagine an artificial satellite without orientation control ; one can expect that in the course of motion , it will perform a ( perhaps very slow ) rotation .",
    "the problem of _ minimal mean resistance _ for non - convex _ rotating _ bodies in two dimensions was considered in @xcite ; it was proved that the gain in resistance , as compared with the convex case , is smaller than @xmath8 .    here",
    "we study the problem of _ maximal mean resistance _ for _ rotating _ bodies in two dimensions , @xmath9 .",
    "this problem is far from being trivial , contrary to the case of purely translational motion . to see it ,",
    "consider a unit disk on the plane , which is moving forward and at the same time slowly ( and uniformly ) rotating .",
    "denote the disk by @xmath10 .",
    "`` cut off '' a small portion of the disk contained in the @xmath11-neighborhood of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) ; the resulting set @xmath14 is such that @xmath15 ( here @xmath16 designates @xmath11-neighborhood ) .",
    "the question is : how large can the increase of resistance @xmath17 be ?",
    "some estimates can be made immediately .",
    "firstly , it can not exceed @xmath18 .",
    "this hypothetical maximal increase is achieved if the velocity of a reflected particle is always opposite to the incidence velocity , @xmath19 ; in this case the momentum transmitted by the particle to the body is maximal .",
    "next , if the circumference @xmath12 is partitioned into several small arcs and each arc is substituted with a pair of legs of a right isosceles triangle contained in @xmath10 ( the resulting body is shown on fig.(a ) below ) then resistance increases approximately @xmath20 times . more precisely , if the length of each arc is @xmath21 then the resistance increase is @xmath22 ; for the proof see appendix 1 .",
    "another example is the body obtained by making deep and narrow rectangular `` hollows '' on the boundary of @xmath10 ; see fig.(b ) .",
    "put the depth of any hollows to be @xmath11 , width @xmath23 , and the distance between neighboring hollows , @xmath24 .",
    "then approximately one half of the particles incident on a hollow get out with the velocity opposite to the initial one , and the rest of the particles get out with the velocity symmetric to the initial one with respect to the smaller side of the rectangle .",
    "resistance of the body is , approximately , the arithmetic mean of the disk resistance and the ( hypothetical ) maximal resistance ( 1.5 times the disk resistance ) ; that is , the resistance increase is @xmath25 , @xmath26 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     one can see that the boundary of the second figure is much more complicated than of the first one",
    ". `` complexity '' of the boundary can be measured by the maximal value of rotation angle of the normal vector on a small part of the boundary .",
    "this `` maximal instantaneous rotation '' is , approximately , @xmath27 for the first figure and @xmath28 for the second one .    to be precise , fix a convex bounded body @xmath0 and consider a sequence @xmath29 , @xmath30 approximating @xmath0 . define the value rot@xmath31 measuring boundary complexity of the sequence in the following way .",
    "for each point @xmath32 , let @xmath33 be the outer unit normal at @xmath34 and let @xmath35 .",
    "for any @xmath36 , define rot@xmath37 ; is the @xmath11-neighborhood of @xmath34 .",
    "] let us call it @xmath38-rotation of the boundary @xmath39 .",
    "it is monotone non - increasing as @xmath26 . then put rot@xmath40rot@xmath41 and define rot@xmath42rot@xmath43 : @xmath11-rotation for the approximating sequence @xmath29 .",
    "finally , define rot@xmath44rot@xmath45 and call this value _ rotation of boundary _ for the given sequence of bodies .",
    "this value is @xmath46 for the first sequence of figures , and @xmath47 for the second one .",
    "the difference is almost threefold .",
    "further , the boundary length for the second sequence of figures tends to infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "one easily calculates that the boundary length tends to @xmath48 for the first sequence ; that is , the limit value is approximately 1.5 times the perimeter of unit circle .    throughout this paper",
    "it was assumed that the `` inner temperature '' of the wind is zero .",
    "however , one can show that in the case of positive temperature , that is , chaotic relative motion of wind particles , the functional to be minimized is proportional to the functional @xmath49 ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "therefore all the results of this paper remain valid in the case of positive temperature ; the detailed explication is postponed to a future paper .",
    "we are also going to study the three - dimensional case in a future paper .",
    "denote by @xmath50 the set depicted on fig.(a ) in introduction .",
    "here @xmath11 divides @xmath51 and conv@xmath50 is a @xmath52-sided regular polygon inscribed in the unit circle @xmath10 .",
    "its perimeter is @xmath53 .",
    "the convex part of @xmath54 is a finite collection of points and all the cavities of @xmath50 are isosceles right triangles similar to @xmath55 . applying ( [ 6 ] ) ,",
    "one gets @xmath56 . according to the same formula ( [ 6 ] ) , resistance of the unit circle @xmath10 equals @xmath57 .",
    "it remains to calculate @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 be the subsets of @xmath62}\\times [ 0,\\ , 1]$ ] given by the inequalities @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "one easily verifies the following .",
    "\\(a ) if @xmath66 then the corresponding billiard particle makes only one reflection from the left leg of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "\\(b ) if @xmath69 then there is a single reflection from the right leg of @xmath67 and @xmath70 .",
    "\\(c ) if @xmath71 then there is a double reflection , either from the left and then from the right leg or vice versa , and @xmath72 .    therefore , according to ( [ 5 ] ) , one has @xmath73",
    "@xmath74 @xmath75 direct calculation gives @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; thus , @xmath78 .",
    "recall that a right triangle is called canonical if ( a ) it is situated above its hypotenuse and ( b ) the median dropped on the hypotenuse is vertical .",
    "the angle @xmath79 the hypotenuse forms with the horizontal line , @xmath80 , is called inclination of the triangle .",
    "consider a particle that intersects the hypotenuse , gets into the triangle , makes one or two reflections from the legs , and then intersects the hypotenuse again and leaves the triangle .",
    "denote by @xmath81 the angle the initial velocity @xmath82 forms with the vector @xmath83 , and by @xmath84 , the angle the final velocity @xmath85 forms with @xmath86 .",
    "thus , one has @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath81 and @xmath84 vary between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "parametrize the hypotenuse by the parameter @xmath91 $ ] ; the value @xmath92 corresponds to the left endpoint of the hypotenuse , and the value @xmath93 , to the right one .",
    "like in appendix 1 , denote by @xmath59 the set of values @xmath94 \\times [ 0,\\ , 1]$ ] corresponding to particles having a single reflections from the left leg , by @xmath60 , the set of values corresponding to a single reflection from the right leg , and by @xmath61 , the set corresponding to particles having double reflections .",
    "one easily finds that @xmath59 is given by the inequality @xmath95 , @xmath60 , by the inequality @xmath96 , and @xmath61 , by the double inequality @xmath97 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath66 holds @xmath98 , for @xmath69 holds @xmath99 , and for @xmath71 holds @xmath100 . on the picture",
    "below , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "( 3,-0.5 )    consider the parallel beam of particles falling on the hypotenuse in the direction @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath104 , then the portion of particles that make only one reflection equals @xmath105 and the direction of reflected particles is @xmath106 ; one has to choose the sign  +  if @xmath107 , and `` @xmath108 '' if @xmath109 .",
    "the rest of particles make double reflections ; the portion of these particles is @xmath110 , and the direction of reflected particles is @xmath81 . if @xmath111 then all the particles make a single reflection and the direction of reflected particles is @xmath106 .",
    "now , consider the arc of circumference of angular size @xmath112 contained in the half - plane @xmath113 , with the endpoints @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",

    "defines a standard cavity .",
    "denote by @xmath121 the maximum length of a small arc .",
    "( 6,-2 )    for small @xmath121 , the scheme of billiard reflection can be approximately substituted with the following description ( pseudo - billiard reflections from the arc @xmath122 ) . a particle of some mass moving in a direction @xmath123 is reflected from the arc @xmath122 .",
    "if @xmath104 , it is split into two `` splinters '' of relative masses @xmath105 and @xmath124 . the first splinter is reflected in the direction @xmath125 , and the second , in the direction @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath126 , there is no splitting , and the whole particle is reflected in the direction @xmath127 .",
    "the described dynamics will be called _ pseudo - billiard _ one .",
    "a particle of unit mass starts moving at a point of @xmath128 in a direction @xmath123 , and after several pseudo - billiard reflections , the resulting splinters return to @xmath129 .    as a result of the described substitution of the billiard dynamics with the pseudo - billiard one , one obtains the function @xmath130 where @xmath131 are masses and @xmath132 , final directions of the splinters resulting from the particle with the initial data @xmath133 .",
    "( as we will see later , splitting can really occur only once , after the first reflection , therefore there are at most two splinters . )",
    "the difference between @xmath134 and the true value of the functional @xmath49 ( [ 5 ] ) is @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "this fact can be expressed as @xmath137 .",
    "below we will calculate @xmath134 .    in order to describe the pseudo - billiard motion , it is helpful to change the variables .",

    "consider a particle that starts moving at some point @xmath139 of the circumference , intersects @xmath129 at some point @xmath140 , and then reflects from the arc , according to the pseudo - billiard rule , at a point @xmath79 .",

    "if @xmath143 , there is no splitting , and if @xmath144 , there is .",
    "let us describe the dynamics of the first splinter .",
    "for a while , change the notation ; let @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and designate by @xmath147 the point of intersection of the splinter trajectory with the circumference . denote by @xmath81 the initial direction of the particle , and by @xmath148 , the direction of the splinter after the first reflection .",

    "one derives the formula @xmath157 ; it follows that the point @xmath156 does not belong to the arc , that is , there are no reflections anymore .",
    "summarizing , the pseudo - billiard dynamics is as follows .",
    "after the first reflection from the arc , the particle may , and may not , split into two `` splinters '' . if @xmath158 \\cup [ \\psi,\\ \\pi/2]$ ] , there are no splitting , and the reflection is unique . if @xmath159 $ ] , there is splitting into two splinters .",
