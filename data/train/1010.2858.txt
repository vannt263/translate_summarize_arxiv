    ", we used the algorithm presented in the previous section to calculate the dc conductivity of slg with resonant impurities or vacancies .",
    "we found that there is plateau of the order of the minimum conductivity @xcite @xmath77 in the vicinity of the neutrality point , in agreement with theoretical expectations @xcite . beyond the plateau ,",
    "the conductivity is inversely proportional to the concentration of the impurities , and approximately proportional to the carrier concentration @xmath78 .",
    "this is consistent with the approach based on the boltzmann equation , which in the limit of resonant impurities with @xmath79 , yields for the conductivity  @xcite @xmath80where @xmath81 is the number of charge carriers per carbon atom , and @xmath82 is of order of the bandwidth .",

    "leads to the dependence @xmath83where @xmath84 corresponds to electron and hole doping , respectively , and @xmath21 is the effective impurity radius .",
    "the boltzmann approach does not work near the neutrality point where quantum corrections are dominant ostrovsky2006 , katsnelson2006 , auslender2007 . in the range of concentrations , where the boltzmann approach is applicable , our numerical results of the conductivity of slg as a function of energy fits very well to the dependence given by eq .",
    "( [ fitting ] ) @xcite .",
    "electron scattering in blg has been proven to differ essentially from slg in ref .",
    ": for a scattering potential with radius much smaller than the de broglie wavelength of electrons , the phase shift of @xmath85-wave scattering @xmath86 tends to a constant as @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , within the limit of applicability of the boltzmann equation , the conductivity of a bilayer should be just linear in @xmath78 , instead of sublinear dependence ( [ fitting ] ) for slg .",
    "the difference is that in slg , due to vanishing dos at the dirac point , the scattering disappears at small wave vectors as @xmath88 ( with @xmath89 on the order of 10 for typical amounts of doping ) for resonant and as @xmath90 for the nonresonant impurities .",
    "in contrast , in blg there are no restrictions on the strength of the scattering and even the unitary limit ( @xmath91 ) can be reached at @xmath92 .    however , these conclusions are based on the use of an approximate parabolic spectrum for the bilayer which is valid for the energy interval @xmath93 in the opposite case @xmath94the effects of the interlayer hopping are negligible and one should expect a behavior of the conductivity similar to that of slg .",
    "our first set of numerical calculations of blg are performed for similar concentrations of resonant impurities ( @xmath95 $ ] ) as those used for slg in refs . . the interlayer hopping parameters are taken as @xcite @xmath96 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ ximp ] , finite concentrations of the resonant impurities lead to the formation of a low energy impurity band ( see increased dos at low energies in fig .",
    "[ ximp ] ) .",
    "the impurity band can host two electrons per impurity , and for impurity concentrations in the range of @xmath97 $ ] , this leads to a plateau - shaped minimum of width @xmath98 in the conductivity vs. @xmath78 curves around the neutrality point .",
    "as one can see from the dos in fig .",
    "[ ximp ] , even for @xmath99 , the width of the impurity band around the neutrality point is comparable to the limits of applicability of the parabolic approximation for the spectrum ( ineqq1 ) , therefore for the concentrations of the impurities presented in fig .",
    "[ ximp ] one can not use the theory @xcite . for small electron concentrations we are beyond the limit of the boltzmann theory at all , and for the larger electron concentration we are , rather , in the regime ( [ ineqq2 ] ) so one could expect a sublinear behavior similar to that in slg . indeed , the conductivity of blg as a function of charge density @xmath78 follows almost exactly the same dependence as for the slg ( see the direct comparisons of conductivities in fig .",
    "[ ximp ] ) .",
    "that is , the density - dependence of conductivity in blg is not linear but sublinear ( [ fitting ] ) as in slg .",
    "actually , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ximpslbltri ] , the sublinear dependence is quite general for multilayer graphene , i.e. , it is also true for trilayer and quartic - layer graphene with the same concentration of resonant impurities , independent on the stacking sequence , which is , of course , not surprising assuming that the condition ( [ ineqq2 ] ) holds . here for the trilayer ( quartic - layer ) we consider two types of stacking sequence : aba ( abab ) and abc ( abcd ) .",
    "this general property of the conductivity can be easily understood by comparison of their dos in fig .",
    "the dos of single - layer , bilayer , trilayer and quartic - layer graphene are exactly the same except near the edge of the spectrum , indicating the similar band structure , independent on the number of layers and stacking sequence .",
    "in fact , since the couplings between the carbon atoms and organic admolecules are twenty times larger than the interlayer coupling ( @xmath100 ) in our model , the unique bonds generated by the relevant weaker interlayer interactions are more easily to be destroyed by the impurity bonds generated by the much stronger adsorbed resonant impurities .    in order to check the symmetry of the presence of the impurities , we limit the adsorption of organic admolecules to one layer of blg ( @xmath101 , case ii ) .",
    "to compare the results of the adsorption on both sides ( @xmath102 , case i ) , we fix the total number of resonant impurities and therefore the concentration on one layer ( case ii ) is doubled ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we find ( see last panel in fig .",
    "[ ximp ] ) that for the low concentration ( @xmath104 ) , the electron - density dependence of the conductivity in blg follows the same law in both cases ; at high concentration ( @xmath105 ) , the conductivity in case ii is larger than in case i. this is because in case ii the difference of mobility of electron in the two layers , with or without impurities , is larger than in the case of large concentrations of adsorbed admolecules .",
    "next we consider the region of parameters which can be described by the boltzmann equation plus parabolic spectrum @xcite . in blg ,",
    "the approximations of massive valence and conduction bands with zero gap : @xmath106 , where the effective mass is given by @xmath107 , are only true in the low - energy dispersion close to the neutrality point .",
    "there are two ways to place the impurity bands within the region of low - energy dispersion ( ineqq1 ) : decreasing the concentration @xmath102 of impurities or expanding the quadratic band by increasing @xmath108 .",
    "smaller concentration of impurities leads to less random states for the averaging in the kubo formula of eq .",
    "( [ conducappr ] ) , which means that it is numerically more expensive because we need to extend the sample size to keep the same accuracy .",
    "therefore increasing @xmath108 is computationally more convenient from the point of view of cpu time and physical memory ; one can assume that physical results should be the same : it is only the ratio @xmath109 which is important .    in fig .",
    "[ dosblgemma1 ] , we compare numerical results of dos of blg with different band parameter @xmath108 : @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( @xmath112 is fixed as @xmath66 ) .",
    "one can see that the width of the parabolic band with the energy - independent local density of states proportional to @xmath108 , and the normalized energy ( in units of @xmath108 ) dependencies of dos ( in the units of @xmath113 ) within the parabolic band are consistent for different @xmath108 ( see the inner panel of fig .",
    "[ dosblgemma1 ] ) .",
    "therefore we can simply use @xmath108 with the value of @xmath111 instead of @xmath66 to extend the width of the parabolic band approximation without changing the structure of the spectrum .",
    "the numerical results form a system with @xmath114 times larger of @xmath108 , are qualitatively comparable to those for a system of @xmath115 times smaller concentration @xmath102 of impurities .    the numerical results for the dos and conductivities of blg and tlg in the presence of resonant impurity with larger interlayer interactions ( @xmath116 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ ximpslbltri ] .",
    "we see that for an impurity concentration of @xmath117 , the impurity band is located around the neutral point and far from the edge of the quadratic band ( @xmath118 ) . in the region of the impurity band",
    "( @xmath119 ) , there is a plateau in the order of @xmath120 ( per layer ) in blg , as well as in tlg .",
    "this values is slightly larger than the minimum conductivity @xmath77 of slg .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that an explanation of the origin of plateau around the neutrality point is beyond the applicability of boltzmann equation , just as in the case of slg wehling2010,yuan2010 . analyzing experimental data of the plateau width ( similar to the analysis for n@xmath3o@xmath121 acceptor states in ref . )",

    "actually , these sublinear and linear dependencies are also observed in tlg , independent on the stacking sequence ( see fig .",
    "gaussian_gemma1 ) .",
    "the same value of the minimum conductivity ( @xmath0 ) at the charge neutrality point is observed for both blg and tlg with @xmath147 .",
    "as we discussed in the case of resonant impurities , the adoption of larger @xmath108 is equivalent to the use of smaller disorder , and therefore our results indicate that the minimum conductivity in order of @xmath0 is common in blg and tlg with small concentration of random gaussian potentials",
    ". these numerical results are consistent with the analytical result for blg in ref . .",
    "the origin of disorder in the nearest neighbor coupling could be substitutional impurities like n or b instead of c , or distortions of graphene sheet . to be specific ,",
    "we introduce the disorder in the hopping by a gaussian distribution in a similar way as random gaussian potential , namely , the distribution of the nearest neighbor hopping parameters reads@xmath148where @xmath149 is the number of the gaussian centers , @xmath150 is uniformly random in the range @xmath151 $ ] and @xmath152 is interpreted as the effective screening length . similarly , the typical values of @xmath152 are the same as for the gaussian potential , i.e. , @xmath153 and @xmath139 for short- and long - range gaussian random hopping , respectively , and the values of @xmath149 are characterized by the value @xmath154 .",
    "similar as in eq .",
    "( [ vgaussian ] ) , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ tgaussian ] ) does not include the overlapping of the gaussian distribution in different layers .",
    "like in the case of gaussian potentials , the presence of random gaussian hopping in blg and tlg also suppresses the van hove singularities in the spectrum , but does not introduce a new impurity band ( midgap states ) and there is also no plateau in the conductivity vs. electron density curves ( see fig . [ trgaussian ] and [ trgaussianc ] ) .",
    "the unique feature characteristic for the presence of random gaussian hopping is that in the region near the neutrality point , the conductivity is always linearly dependent on the electron density , with no influence from the concentration of gaussian centers ( different @xmath155 in fig .",
    "[ trgaussian ] ) , range of gaussian coupling ( @xmath153 or @xmath139 ) , strength of the interlayer coupling ( @xmath156 in fig .",
    "[ trgaussian ] and @xmath111 in fig .",
    "trgaussianc ) , number of layers ( bilayer or trilayer ) and stacking sequence ( aba or abc in tlg ) .",
    "the differences of short- or long - range cases are only obvious in the energy region far from the neutrality point ( high concentration of charge density ) : the increase of conductivity as a function of charge density is monotonic only for the long - range disorder . furthermore , like in the case of random gaussian potential , a common minimum conductivity in the order of @xmath120 on charge neutrality point is also observed for both blg and tlg .",
    "we have presented a detailed numerical study of the electronic transport properties of bilayer and trilayer graphene within the framework of a noninteracting tight - binding model .",
    "various realistic types of disorder are considered , such as resonant impurities , vacancies , random gaussian on - site potentials , and random gaussian hopping between nearest carbon atoms .",
    "our results give a consistent picture of the electronic structure and transport properties of bilayer and trilayer graphene in a broad range of concentration of impurities or other sources of disorder .",
    "linear or sublinear electron - density dependent conductivity at high enough density is observed , depending on the type and strength of the disorder and the stacking sequence .",
    "the minimum conductivity @xmath157 ( per layer ) on charge neutrality point is common for blg and tlg , independent of the type of the impurities , but the plateau of minimum conductivity around the neutrality point is unique when resonant impurities or vacancies are present .    in the presence of resonant impurities or vacancies ,",
    "the dependence of the conductivity as a function of electron density is affected by the relevant width of the impurity band and the band created by the interlayer hopping . using blg with vacancies as an example : introducing @xmath158  as the density of electrons on the boundary of the parabolic band , and considering the case that the concentration of vacancies ( @xmath127 ) is smaller than @xmath159 , i.e.",
    ", the impurity band is within the region of the parabolic conduction band , there are three regions of electron - density dependence of the conductivity :    \\(i ) @xmath160 , a central minimum conductivity plateau ( @xmath120  per layer ) with width equals to @xmath126 ;    \\(ii ) @xmath161 , linear dependence , as predicted by the analytical treatment using the boltzmann equation for parabolic spectrum @xcite ;    \\(iii ) @xmath162 , sublinear dependence , as the effects of the interlayer hopping are negligible in this region and one should expect a behavior of the conductivity similar to that of slg .    on the opposite case @xmath162 , region ( ii ) simply disappears and therefore we can only observe the minimum conductivity plateau and sublinear dependence on the high concentration of electron densities . actually , the sublinear dependence beyond the parabolic band is a general property of slg , blg and mlg with large enough concentration of resonant impurities or vacancies , independent on the number of layers and the stacking sequence .    in the presence of random gaussian on - site potentials ,",
    "the electron - density dependences of conductivity of blg or tlg are sublinear and linear in the low concentration of charges , for short- and long - range disorders , respectively but are always sublinear in the high concentration .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of random gaussian carbon  carbon couplings , the density - dependence of conductivity in the region close to the neutrality point is more simple : there is only a linear dependence , with no effect of the strength and range of disorder , the number of layers and stacking sequence .",
    "note added : after this paper was submitted , a paper which also discusses the effect of resonant scatterers on the dc conductivity of single - layer and bilayer graphene appeared  @xcite , with results that are consistent with ours .",
