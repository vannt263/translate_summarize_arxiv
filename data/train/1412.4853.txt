    "solar jets have been observed at various wavelengths ( e.g. h@xmath1 @xcite , euv and x - ray @xcite ) .",

    "* ) , coronal holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently a dichotomy of jets was suggested by @xcite .",
    "about two thirds of the observed jets fit the `` standard '' reconnection picture , which invokes reconnection between oppositely directed magnetic fields , e.g. an emerging and a pre - existing magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the other one third have been termed `` blowout '' jets , which are triggered by an eruption .",
    "more precisely , it has been observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the precursor of a `` blowout '' jet , is a twisted and/or a sheared arch , which often carries a ( small ) filament or flux rope within it .",
    "when this structure becomes unstable and erupts , it blows out the envelope field producing an untwisting ejection of cool ( e.g. chromospheric ) and hot material .",
    "this `` blowout '' jet is a broad , curtain - like structure in opposition to the `` standard '' jet , which is more elongated and it is not commonly associated with an eruption event .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations on the formation of blowout jets , during the emergence and eruption of solar magnetic fields , have been carried out by @xcite , @xcite & @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that the interaction between an emerging ( twisted ) magnetic field and an ambient ( non - twisted ) magnetic field in the solar corona can trigger both standard and `` blowout '' jets .",
    "their experiments reproduced some of the observed characteristics of the blowout jets , their internal helical structure and their overal curtain - like shape .",
    "@xcite studied the recurrent onset of eruptions in an efr and their possible relationship to the subsequent emission of `` blowout '' jets . using a similar numerical set - up",
    ", @xcite showed that heat conduction leads to an increase of the total mass ejection in the corona during the emission of the `` blowout '' jets . in previous simulations",
    ", @xcite had shown that an unwinding jet could be the result of reconnection between a twisted loop and an open flux tube . the unwinding motion , which has also been reported in observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been interpreted as the propagation of torsional alfvn waves ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) releasing the stored twist from a twisted magnetic loop into the open ambient field .",
    "however , no _ direct _ evidence of _ propagating _ alfvn waves in `` blowout '' jets has been provided so far , either on numerical or observational studies .    here",
    ", we report on the recurrent emission of `` blowout '' jets in an efr with a sea - serpent configuration .",
    "we show that the `` blowout '' jets are untwisted during their ejection and , for the first time , we provide direct evidence of propagating torsional alfvn waves during the emission of the `` blowout '' jets .",
    "we solve the 3d time - dependent , resistive and compressible mhd equations in cartesian geometry , using the lare3d code @xcite .",
    "explicit ( uniform ) resistivity of @xmath2 is included .",
    "the initial atmosphere consists of horizontal and homogenous parallel layers in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the solar interior is represented by a layer in the range ( @xmath3 ) , which is adiabatically stratified . the photosphere / chromosphere layer lies at @xmath4 . the temperature at the photosphere is @xmath5 and it increases up to @xmath6 at the top chromosphere",
    ". the transition region is located at heights @xmath7 . above it , there is an isothermal layer ( @xmath8 ) , which is mimicking the lower solar corona ( @xmath9 ) . in the solar interior ,",
    "the magnetic field is a horizontal magnetic flux tube , which is twisted .",
    "the flux tube is located at @xmath10 and its axis is parallel to the y - axis at @xmath11 .",
    "the component of the magnetic field along the tube s axis ( axial field ) is given by @xmath12 where the tube s radius is @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the radial distance from the tube s axis ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the twist of the fieldlines around the tube s axis is uniform and it is given by @xmath16 . with this twist",
    "the tube is marginally stable to the kink instability .",
    "initially , we apply a deficit in density along the tube s axis , making two segments ( i.e. at @xmath11 , @xmath17 ) more buoyant than the rest of the tube : @xmath18\\,\\rho(z)\\,\\mathrm{exp}\\,(-y^2/\\lambda^2)\\sin^{2}\\left(2\\pi y/\\omega\\right).\\ ] ] thus , @xmath19 is the difference between the background density and the density inside the flux tube after we apply the density deficit along its axis .",
    "the pressure within the flux tube is @xmath20 , @xmath21 defines half the length of each buoyant part of the tube , and @xmath22 is defined as half of the flux tube length .",
    "we use @xmath23 , @xmath24 and an initial field strength of @xmath25 , which corresponds to plasma @xmath26 .",
    "the corona is filled with an ambient field which is oblique , and is defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and gradually decreases to 0 for @xmath31 .",
    "the numerical domain is @xmath32 \\times [ -31.5,31.5 ] \\times[-5.4,57.6]\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ ] in the direction perpendicular to the tube ( @xmath33 ) , along the tube s axis ( @xmath34 ) and vertical ( @xmath35 ) , respectively .",
    "the numerical grid is a @xmath36 box with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath33 and @xmath34 direction . at the top",
    ", there is an open boundary allowing plasma to flow out of the grid .",
    "there is a non - penetrating , conducting wall at the bottom boundary .",
    "* ( b ) * a close - up of the fieldline topology ( @xmath37 min ) .",
    "fieldlines have been traced from the two emerging bipoles ( blue ) and from the ambient field ( red ) .",
    "arrows show the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the ( dashed ) rectangle indicates the channel along which the first blowout jet is emitted . ]                  in the following , we discuss the results of our simulations showing : ( a ) the emergence of the sea - serpent flux tube at the photosphere , ( b ) the recurrent onset of the jets and ( c ) the propagation of torsional alfvn waves during the untwisting motion of the blowout jet(s ) .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the initial ( i.e. at @xmath40 ) topology of the magnetic field .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the connectivity of the fieldlines during the first blowout jet emission .",
    "the ( blue ) fieldlines show ( a ) the sea - serpent configuration of the emerging field and ( b ) the twisted fieldlines at the center of the efr , which are the result of reconnection between the emerging loops .",
    "the ( red ) fieldlines are reconnected fieldlines that join the ambient with the emerging field . due to the sea - serpent configuration ,",
    "the downward tension of the uppermost fieldines ( i.e. the envelope field ) of each emerging loop is released more effectively due to reconnection with ( _ both _ ) the ambient field and the field of the neighbouring emerging loop .",
    "thus , unavoidably , this interaction affects the onset time and dynamics of the efr s eruptions , compared to a `` single emerging loop - ambient field '' reconnection case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the magnetogram during the emergence of the field into the photosphere at @xmath41 .",
    "the overplotted arrows represent the direction of the magnetic field vector . due to the initial density deficit , the emerging magnetic field at the solar surface forms two bipolar regions ( hereafter , br1 and br2 ) . at @xmath42 ( figure 2(b ) ) , the polarities of each br have moved apart along the @xmath34-direction . in previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has been shown that this movement is followed by shearing along the polarity inversion line ( pil ) , and the formation of a new flux rope , which might erupt into the corona .",
    "this is also found to happen in the present simulation , within each br .",
    "moreover , we find that shearing and reconnection leading to the formation of a flux rope , occurs also between the opposite polarities p1 and n2 due to their relative motion .    before the onset of the eruptions ( @xmath43 ) , each emerging bipole comes into contact and eventually reconnects with the ambient magnetic field , giving onset to hot reconnection jets .",
    "figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) show the temperature and @xmath44 distribution respectively , at @xmath11 and @xmath41 .",
    "we find that the upward reconnection jets are moving with a velocity of @xmath45 , reaching temperatures of up to @xmath46 at the reconnection site , and @xmath47 within the jet channels .",
    "figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) show the first eruptive event within the efr .",
    "the eruption of the cool plasma starts within br2 .",
    "figure 2(e ) shows the temperature and figure 2(f ) shows the density distribution at @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the rise of the erupting material induces inflow towards the interface , where a current layer has built up , between the envelope and the ambient field .",
    "this leads to more external reconnection between the two magnetic flux systems and the onset of a hot and fast external reconnection jet .",
    "the plasma at the interface is heated up to @xmath50 .",
    "a side - effect of the external reconnection is the formation of a hot external arcade with temperature up to @xmath51 .    at @xmath52 ( figures 2(g ) , 2(h ) ) ,",
    "the eruption blows out the envelope field and the dense erupting material is emitted along the reconnected fieldlines of the oblique ambient field .",
    "now the channel of the blowout jet and the external arcade are much wider .",
    "cool ( @xmath53 ) and hot ( @xmath46 ) plasmas are ejected along the blowout jet s channel and heating ( due to internal reconnection ) is produced underneath the erupting plasma , where an internal arcade of temperature up to @xmath54 is formed .",
    "the top panel in figure 3 shows that there are six events during which @xmath44 varies in the range @xmath0 .",
    "each event consists of several peaks in @xmath44 .",
    "the fact that the peaks of minimum and maximum @xmath44 occur at approximately the same time suggests the existence of bidirectional flows from several sites within the efr .",
    "we find that the first peak ( @xmath55 ) corresponds to the jets caused by reconnection between the emerging and the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the second event ( @xmath56 ) is the composite effect of an eruption , which starts from the area in between br1 and br2 , and a reconnection jet that follows the eruption .",
    "the jet is initiated due to the restructuring of the nearby magnetic field due to the eruption ( in a similar manner to the external reconnection jet in figure 2e ) .",
    "however , in this occasion , the erupting plasma becomes confined by the local ambient field and does not evolve into a profound blowout jet that could reach the higher solar atmosphere .",
    "instead , it is moving sideways , from the center of the efr towards the br1 where the total pressure is less .",
    "the other four events correspond to the emission of `` blowout '' jets driven by eruptions that emanate from within the brs .",
    "these jets blast heavy material towards the outer solar atmosphere .",
    "the bottom panel in figure 3 shows the running difference of the integrated plasma density @xmath57 for temperatures above @xmath58 .",
    "it is found that there are four marked events during which dense plasma is brought into the higher atmosphere .",
    "the steep vertical slope at the end of each event indicates that most of the ejected plasma is transported upwards .",
    "the dark regions after the brightening peaks indicate that part of the erupting plasma undergoes gravitational draining .",
    "notice that the time - period between the onset of the blowout jets is not so `` quiet '' .",
    "there are various , less striking events , which do not dump enough mass and energy into the outer corona .",
    "such events ( e.g. at @xmath59 , @xmath60 , etc . ) are small confined eruptions and reconnection coronal jets . by comparing the two panels in figure 3 , we find a good temporal correlation between the four `` blowout '' jets and the emission of bidirectional flows , which occur after @xmath61 .",
    "this is a direct evidence that the `` blowout '' jets are closely associated with reconnection , which is driven by the eruption of cool material from the low atmosphere .",
    "the erupting core of the blowout jets is a twisted flux tube .",
    "figure 4(a ) illustrates the magnetic fieldlines within and around the first blowout jet ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "reconnection of the erupting ( twisted ) field with the open ( non - twisted ) ambient field would most likely relax the twist and lead to an untwisting motion of the helical blowout jet .",
    "a measurement of the twist is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the parallel component of the current along the reconnected fieldlines of the blowout jet .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows the temporal evolution of the average @xmath64 along the channel of the blowout jet .",
    "we calculate this for heights above @xmath65 , which is the approximate horizontal boundary between the envelope field of the emerging flux and the lower part of the blowout jet .",
    "the increase of the twist ( up to @xmath66 ) is due to the eruption of the flux rope and the subsequent decrease indicates the untwisting motion of the jet .",
    "figure 4(c ) shows the distribution of @xmath64 at the vertical slice with @xmath67 .",
    "it is confirmed that the blowout jet possess considerable twist along its main stream ( e.g. in the range @xmath68 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath64 is also very strong ( as expected ) in the twisted emerging field underneath the blowout jet ( e.g. the area with strong @xmath69 at @xmath70 ) .",
    "to show the untwisting motion of the jet , we plot the @xmath71 and @xmath69 distribution ( figures 4(d ) and 4(e ) respectively ) .",
    "there is positive @xmath71 ( pointing out of the plane ) at the right - hand side of the jet , and negative @xmath71 ( pointing into the plane ) at the left - hand side .",
    "this corresponds to a magnetized plasma motion where @xmath69 ( i.e. the transverse component of the magnetic field ) is pointing in the opposite direction to @xmath71 and the associated vorticity ( i.e. @xmath72 ) is pointing downward .",
    "this is a first indication that the jet undergoes an untwisting motion .",
    "more evidence is found by studying the distribution of current and vorticity within the jet .",
    "figure 4(f ) shows the product of @xmath63 with the vorticity @xmath73 . within the jet channel ,",
    "this product is mostly negative indicating that the current and vorticity are pointing in different directions .",
    "in fact , we have found ( not shown in this figure ) that @xmath73 is negative due to the direction of the flow ( and it is pointing downwards ) , while @xmath63 is positive due to the direction of the twist of the fieldlines ( pointing upwards ) .",
    "all the above support the scenario of the untwisting motion of the blowout jet during its emission .",
    "it is likely that the process of untwisting of the erupting plasma in our experiment is similar to the sweeping - magnetic - twist mechanism for the acceleration of solar jets @xcite . in the present simulation",
    ", it is apparent that the twist stored in the erupting flux is released along the direction of the open , reconnected field lines . also",
    ", the direction of the untwisting motion ( e.g. as shown in figure 4 ) is consistent with the relative orientation of the two field components ( i.e. the erupting and the open field ) that reconnect .",
    "thus , it is more likely that the untwisting is related to the propagation of the twist along the reconnected fieldlines instead of the twist itself .    to study the plasma motion of the jet , in relation to the direction of the ambient field , we calculate @xmath74 at various heights , from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "more precisely , we take a horizontal slit at each height and we plot the above quantity , @xmath77 , during the evolution of the system . the left panel in figure 5 shows @xmath77 at @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we trace plasma of temperature between @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we find that firstly the plasma jet is moving towards the positive x direction , then to the negative x direction , and then back towards the positive x direction .",
    "this indicates that the jet undergoes an oscillatory motion during its emission .",
    "a similar result , in the context of helical jets , has been reported by @xcite .",
    "the transverse oscillation velocity amplitude of the jet is @xmath83 .",
    "figure 5 ( a - c ) shows that the oscillation propagates from low to larger heights .",
    "since the jet is considered to be emitted along the ambient magnetic field , this is an evidence of a wave propagating towards the outer solar atmosphere .    to measure the velocity of the propagating wave , we use the height - time diagrams in panels ( a)-(c ) and we plot the running - difference of each panel , as shown in panels ( d)-(f )",
    "then , we find the first ( i.e. along time ) local maximum in each running - difference plot , which corresponds to the first profound increment of plasma density at that height .",
    "it is likely that this point is located at the front of the heavy plasma distribution along the jet .",
    "the height - time profile of this front is then plotted in figure 5(g ) and by calculating the gradient , we obtain the propagating speed ( figure 5(h ) ) .",
    "the latter is comparable to the local alfvn speed , which suggests that we are witnessing the propagation of a torsional alfvn wave during the untwisting motion of the blowout jet .",
    "we find that the above result is generic : all the blowout jets in our experiment show transverse oscillatory motions and encompass propagating alfvn waves along their broad outflow streams .",
    "the initial ambient open field in our experiment has a field strength of approximately @xmath84 .",
    "the density in the high corona is approximately @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , our simulation is mimicking the emission of jets in a coronal hole environment .",
    "we have calculated that in every blowout jet emission , a considerable amount of poynting energy flux ( @xmath86 ) leaves the high corona .",
    "also the mass deposition in the corona increases by a factor of 2 - 4 during the blowout ejecta .",
    "it is likely that the torsional alfvn waves transport the emitted flux from the low corona to the outer atmosphere and load with mass the open field .",
    "this implies that blowout jets may play a significant role in driving the solar wind .",
