    "the crumpling of paper is an everyday occurrence , yet it is a surprisingly rich and complex process . paper is an elastic , flexible and heterogeneous material and many authors have tried to describe its crumpling properties analytically @xcite , numerically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the crumpling process of paper is also interesting because it is a special case of the thin plate deformation problem that is central in describing processes that occur for example in car crashes and tank failures @xcite .",
    "earlier studies have tried to describe the ridge network of crumpled paper @xcite and some results have been found , however much is still unclear .",
    "this work aims at describing the ridge network formed during a common hand crumpling process of ordinary printing paper .",
    "the application of modern network theory @xcite have been specially emphasized .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the experimental procedure",
    "is described , and in section 3 the ridge detection method is presented .",
    "the results are discussed in section 4 , in particular the ridge length and the degree distribution are discussed .",
    "also the degree - degree correlation , the clustering and the surface roughness is investigated in addition to the facet distribution and the angular ridge distribution . finally the main conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "ordinary printing paper was used for all the experiments , and some of the properties of the paper are given in table [ tab : samples ] .",
    "all the samples were cut into square sheets of 21 x 21 cm , and crumpled by hand into small balls .",
    "the diameter of the various balls produced are given in table [ tab : samples ] .",
    "the hand crumpling procedure have been applied before @xcite , and is practical because it is easy to conduct and produces a compact result .",
    "unfortunately the process in not repeatable and poorly controlled .",
    "several test crumplings were conducted before the measured samples were crumpled in order to reduce the variance between the samples .",
    "earlier studies @xcite on acoustic emissions from crumpling of various materials have indicated that the emission spectra show a surprisingly low sensitivity to the crumpling method .",
    "this may indicate that the outcome of the crumpling is not highly sensitive to the details of the process .",
    "@xcite discuss the scaling behavior of the crumpling process for different paper thicknesses .",
    "they conclude that the impact of the variation of the applied confinement force @xmath0 on the ball radius @xmath1 is small since there is only a weak dependence @xmath2 . for these reasons",
    "no special precautions , such as dents or initial folding , were taken to increase repeatability .",
    "after crumpling the samples , they were carefully unfolded taking care not to tear the paper , introduce new ridges or remove some of the original ridges .",
    "when the paper ball was unfolded the paper was stretched to a size of 20 x 20 cm , and fastened to an aluminum plate .",
    "this ensured that the vertical height of the samples were no more than 12 mm ( the maximum range for the instrument used ) .",
    "the full ( 2 + 1)-dimensional height mapping was measured profile by profile using a laser profilometer over an area of 18 x 18 cm in the center of the samples .",
    "the height of each point was measured using a laser giving a voltage output linearly proportional to the distance between the probe and the paper surface .",
    "the voltage output was converted to a floating point length - measure using a 16 bit ad converter .",
    "the laser diameter used was 30 @xmath3 m , however accuracy considerably smaller than this could be achieved .",
    "each profile was acquired by sliding the sample under the probe while measuring .",
    "multiple profiles were acquired by stepping the probe normal to the sliding direction .",
    "a typical one - dimensional height profile and a complete ( 2 + 1)-dimensional map are shown in figure [ fig : map ] .",
    "the number of points per profile was kept equal to the number of profiles resulting in a square grid of measurements or `` pixels '' .",
    "the number of points used for the various samples are given in table [ tab : samples ] .",
    "the in - plane accuracy of each point was no larger than 10 @xmath3 m for any sample , and in the out of plane direction it was 0.5 @xmath3 m for all samples .",
    ".list of samples investigated .",
    "x steps and y steps is the number of measured points in the x and y direction respectively .",
    "thickness is the thickness of the paper and ball diameter is the diameter of the ball produced during the crumpling process .",
    "all samples was originally 21 x 21 cm and thereafter unfolded and stretched to 20 x 20 cm producing a maximum height of 12 mm .",
    "an area of 18 x 18 cm in the center of the samples were measured . [ cols=\"^,^,^,>,<,>,<,^ \" , ]     the roughness of crumpled paper surfaces has been investigated before @xcite .",
    "these investigations have reported self - affine behavior , this means that the surface is statistically characterized by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the height of the profile at position @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a rescaling factor and @xmath8 is the hurst exponent .",
    "we have investigated the one - dimensional profiles produced by the profilometer using the average wavelet coefficient ( awc ) method @xcite , the power spectrum density ( psd ) method @xcite and the bridge method @xcite .",
    "the results from all the methods indicates that the crumpled paper forms a self - affine surface .",
    "earlier works have reported a small scale region with a hurst exponent @xmath9 1.0 and a large scale region with @xmath10 0.7 @xcite and @xmath10 0.8 @xcite .",
    "our results follows the same trend in that there is a cross over scale between two scaling regimes .",
    "however we found the small scale exponent to be @xmath11 , indicating that the surface is asymptotically non - flat at these scales .",
    "unfortunately the data did not give a robust value for @xmath12 because the sample size was too small compared to the crossover scale .",
    "the data did however indicate that @xmath13 and in the range reported above . in figure",
    "[ fig : collage2 ] , results from the psd and awc methods can be seen .",
    "the main points reported above are that the tail of the ridge length distribution is found to be well reproduced by a power - law distribution , and that the short ridges follows a log - normal distribution as reported earlier .",
    "the degree distribution has been shown not to have a power - law tail , but rather an exponential decay , and the networks have been found to be disassortative .",
    "the facet area distribution , the corresponding voronoi diagram area distribution and the delaunay vertex distribution have all been found to fit log - normal distributions .",
    "this work have been supported by vista , a research cooperation between _ the norwegian academy of science and letters _ and _ statoil_. we would also like to thank j.  .",
