    "taylor series expansions are an important tool in the analysis of the effect of small perturbations where the development of a power series in the perturbing influence conveniently organizes successive corrections to the zeroth order result . if a single variable function is written as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the perturbation of small displacement , then the taylor has the form @xmath2 a salient example familiar to the modern physics student is the case of the lorentz factor central to formulae from special relativity .",
    "the lorentz factor appears in the expression for the total energy of a body in motion , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the rest mass , and @xmath6 is the speed of light ; @xmath7 is the object s speed relative to the speed of light . with a single variable taylor series expansion , we readily obtain the energy of the mass when it is at rest , the classical kinetic energy term , and the first relativistic correction .",
    "one has @xmath8 for ordinary speeds ( i.e. for very small @xmath9 ) , the lorentz factor can be expanded as @xmath10 thus , we find for the total energy of the moving mass @xmath11 with the kinetic energy being augmented by the factor @xmath12.the latter correction becomes more important at relativistic speeds where the kinetic energy scales more rapidly than the newtonian quadratic dependence .    for situations involving more than one perturbing influence such as the function @xmath13 where there are several displacements ,",

    "[ eq : eq7 ] , we see that we have first the task of generating the primary series and then the evaluation of the individual terms , which will be polynomials ( i.e. binomials for the case of two variables , trinomials for the three variable case , etc . ) raised to successively increasing integer powers",
    ".    the case of a perturbation which happens to consist of a power series expansion in a small parameter can also be a computationally intensive scenario if one wishes to calculate a perturbative expansion in the small quantity . in the discussion which follows",
    ", we will use @xmath17 as a generic label for the latter . as an example , one may consider @xmath18 , where @xmath19 again , even after the initial expansion , the individual terms will need to be evaluated and like powers of @xmath17 combined .",
    "we now discuss a complementary and less laborious approach for the development of a taylor series where the perturbation has a composite form such as the multivariable case in eq .",
    "[ eq : eq7 ] or the situation where the perturbing influence is itself a power series in a smaller parameter , @xmath17 .",
    "our technique is based on the translation operator which can induce a coordinate shift by generating a taylor series in one or more variable , and the method eliminates intermediate calculations while minimizing clutter .",
    "we comment first on the single variable case ; excellent discussions may be found in standard texts  @xcite . consider a function @xmath0 where as before there is a shift about @xmath20 of @xmath1 . for infinitesimal translations @xmath21 , reasonably behaved functions can be accurately rendered in linearized form with @xmath22 . in terms of the differential operator @xmath23",

    "this logic suggests that we may more accurately take into a finite shift @xmath1 by combining many smaller translations to set up the larger shift .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to suggest that @xmath28 becomes an increasingly accurate approximation as @xmath29 becomes very large .",
    "the identity @xmath30 suggests that we associate a finite translation @xmath1 with the action of the exponentiated differential operator and well known result @xmath31    in conjunction with this result , we apply combinatorial logic to develop a series in @xmath32 .",
    "although the series will turn out to be nothing other than the standard single variable taylor expansion given in eq  [ eq : eq30 ] , a very similar approach will be applied to obtain the terms of the multivariable expansion where there are more intricacies to navigate .",
    "returning to the infinite product form , @xmath33 , we examine how the power series will take shape as @xmath29 becomes very large",
    ".    the zeroth order term in the power series will clearly be unity . to obtain the first order term",
    ", we must mix in a factor of @xmath34 , and there are a total of @xmath29 ways of doing this . for the second order term , there are @xmath29 ways to choose the first factor of @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ways to choose the second factor .",
    "however , with the order not being relevant , there will be redundant terms , and we must divide by a permutation factor of @xmath36 to compensate for double counting . proceeding in a similar way , we see that the prefactor for the third order term will be @xmath37 . combining these results , we see that the entire series will have the form @xmath38 finally , in the large @xmath29 limit , factors involving @xmath29 cancel and we obtain the anticipated result @xmath39",

    "note that since @xmath52 and @xmath53 are distinct , there is no need to divide by a redundancy factor . on the other hand , when @xmath54 , we need to compensate for double counting by dividing by @xmath36 , and the term is @xmath55 as @xmath56 .",
    "in general , one obtains a partial derivative @xmath57 for each copy of @xmath58 , and we must divide by the permutation factor @xmath59 to compensate for multiple counting . as an example , the coefficient of the term @xmath60 would be @xmath61 .    a salient and frequently occurring case where we will gain an advantage are situations in which the perturbing elements are combined together in a single term , i.e. as in @xmath62)$ ] .",
    "an important example is the case of an expression raised to a power @xmath63 which need nt be an integer ( though there are nontrivial cases that are often of interest such as the reciprocal , where @xmath64 ) .",

    ", the partial derivative @xmath68 yields a factor @xmath63 ( independent of the value of @xmath52 ) , and this value is the expansion coefficient . for the quadratic terms , the partial differentiation will yield for each @xmath69 the same factor @xmath70 .",
    "in addition , we will need to divide by the permutation factor @xmath36 if the two indices @xmath52 and @xmath53 are identical .    in general , as we continue to the third and higher order terms ,",
    "the only things to keep in mind are the overall order of the term ( the value of the derivative of @xmath71 is fixed in this way ) , and the instances of repeated indices where it will be necessary to divide by a multiplicity factor for each case where there is a repeated index . for brevity , we represent the expansion series as @xmath72)^{\\alpha } =   1 + [ a_{1 } \\delta_{1 } + a_{2 } \\delta_{2 } + \\ldots + a_{n } \\delta_{n } ] + [ a_{11 } \\delta_{1}^{2 } + a_{12 } \\delta_{1 }   \\delta_{2 } ] + \\ldots$ ] a few examples are @xmath73    our results for the multivariable case also have relevance for perturbations which are themselves power series in a single variable .",
    "one may have , for example , an expression of the form @xmath74)^{\\alpha } , \\label{eq : eq20}\\ ] ] where the series may terminate or instead be an infinite power series . to make use of the machinery we have discussed in the case of more than one variable , we substitute a @xmath46 for each term in the series ( e.g. we set @xmath75 , @xmath76 , etc ) . for convenience in sorting the terms",

    "we may now systematically and conveniently write down the terms in the expansion for @xmath82^{\\alpha}$ ] , though we mention one caveat ; it is important to list all possible combinations of the @xmath46 factors in developing the expansion . for terms up to fourth order , this is easy to do by inspection . for the higher order cases",
    ", one can systematically enumerate all of the @xmath46 combinations by listing all possible partitions of the integer corresponding to the order , and a recursive procedure for the partitioning is described in the appendix . since the value of the partial derivatives depends only on the total number of differentiations , we will use the notation @xmath83 where , e.g. , @xmath84 and @xmath85 following the rules derived earlier , the coefficients of powers of @xmath17 are @xmath86 for the first order contribution , @xmath87x^{2}\\ ] ] for the second order piece , @xmath88x^{3 } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for the third order terms , @xmath89 x^{4 }   \\\\ \\nonumber\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for the fourth order contribution .",
