    "herbig aebe stars ( haebe ) are intermediate mass ( 28 m@xmath1 ) analogs to the roughly solar - mass t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "the number of haebe stars in the galaxy depends on the selection criteria , and as a result different studies have listed as few as @xmath250 ( herbig s original list included 26 stars , but see * ? ? ? * ) or as many as several hundred @xcite .",
    "one of the more conservative definitions assigns the haebe name to stars of spectral type a and b ( and early f ) that have broadened atomic emission lines in their optical spectra ( hence the `` e '' in `` aebe '' ) and have infrared emission in excess of a purely photospheric spectral energy distribution . using these criteria",
    ", @xcite identified 45 haebe stars and published spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from uv to mm wavelengths , proposing an evolutionary scenario based on mid - infrared colors and sed structure .",
    "@xcite observed the 14 spatially unresolved sources ( at all wavelengths ) from the list by @xcite with the short - wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) aboard the _ infrared space observatory ( iso)_. they report the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in seven of the 14 sources , proposing that the emitting pahs are located in flared disks where the shadow of a thicker inner disk can not attenuate the uv radiation .",
    "@xcite recently presented spectra from the sws for the entire list of sources of @xcite , and they report the detection of pah emission in many of them , mentioning the possibility that differences in the ionization fraction of the pahs could help explain the structure in the 220  spectra .",
    "they also noted that emission from crystalline silicates may confuse the issue .",
    "it is also clear from the sws spectrum of 51 oph ( hd 156843 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that emission from gas near the stars may play a significant role in shaping the mid - infrared spectra of these stars and complicating detailed studies of pah emission in that spectral range .",
    "@xcite have analyzed ground - based and iso observations of some 30 haebe stars and applied a model in which the material in the disk is in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , is heated by the central star , and contains large dust grains in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field as well as small grains and pahs that are transiently heated .",
    "they suggest that the pah emission is primarily from the outer disks ( r@xmath2100 au ) and that strong pah emission is predominantly from sources that have flared disks ( as earlier proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite modeled ground - based spectra of hd 141569 in the 813 and 1725  regions using a porous , cometary - type dust model consisting of coagulated , but otherwise unaltered interstellar grains along with fully ionized pahs .",
    "they predict the shape of the 525  spectrum , noting that there should be little emission from crystalline silicates ( no more than 10% by mass fraction ) . since pahs are a significant component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , important to the energy balance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "+    high - sensitivity spectra of pahs allowing precise band strength measurements can provide information about the structure of disks and their physical and chemical conditions .",
    "the presence or absence of pah features may provide clues to the physical properties of the disks in haebe systems , such as their degree of flaring ( cf .",
    "* ) , and may also serve as an evolutionary clock that tracks grain processing , since there are multiple destruction paths for pahs in disks ( intense irradiation , compaction and incorporation in larger grains ) but no clear formation path .",
    "the pahs in disks around haebe stars most likely originate in the ism from which the stars formed . as a significant interstellar component",
    ", pahs may have condensed onto the ice mantles of dust grains in dense clouds that were then incorporated into protostellar nebulae .",
    "the pahs emerge as free - flying molecules when the ice mantles of grains sublimate due to stellar irradiation or grain - grain collisions @xcite . the origin of interstellar pahs ,",
    "however , is not well constrained .",
    "suggested sources for interstellar pahs include : ( 1 ) formation around and ejection from carbon stars @xcite , ( 2 ) shattering of carbonaceous interstellar dust , or of photoprocessing of mantles on interstellar dust grains @xcite , by grain - grain collisions in interstellar shocks @xcite , or ( 3 ) _ in - situ _ formation through ion - molecule reactions @xcite .",
    "it is essential to quantify the pah features as a diagnostic in order to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "we have begun a spectroscopic survey in the mid - infrared ( 5.236  ) of 16 haebe stars from the sample defined by @xcite using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "one of the goals of this study is to closely examine the pah emission in the 5.214  spectral region .",
    "we present the first results of our study with spectra and analysis for four stars that show pah features , no silicate features , and few other solid state features in their spectra .",
    "this has allowed a careful examination of the relative positions , strengths , and shapes of the features at 6.2 , 7.77.9 , 11.3 , and 12.7  without concern for the effects of silicate dust grains , either amorphous or crystalline .",
    "iso_/sws and phot - s spectra of the four sources in our sample show pah emission features @xcite , the _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectra have higher sensitivity , allowing the detailed analysis that we present here .",
    "all four of our sources show evidence of circumstellar disks in their seds @xcite .",
    "hd 34282 evidently has a large keplerian disk inferred from millimeter observations @xcite , and the disk around hd 141569 has been imaged directly in the optical and near infrared @xcite .",
    "hd 135344 has yet to be spatially resolved @xcite , but @xcite have spatially resolved the pah emission at 3.3  in hd 169142 .",
    "the four haebe targets were observed with the irs on _ spitzer _ in 2004 from january to october , as described in table 1 .",
    "this paper focuses on the observations with the short - low module ( sl ) , which covers the 5.214   region with a spectral resolving power of r@xmath290 .",
    "the sl slit is 36 ( 2 pixels ) across and 57  long .",
    "we started with the flatfielded images generated by the standard irs data reduction pipeline ( s11.0 ) at the spitzer science center ( ssc ) .",
    "we removed the background emission by differencing images with the source in the separate nod positions of each of the sl apertures .",
    "when extracting spectra from the images , we used an extraction window which scales with wavelength ; this method is similar to that used by the ssc pipeline .",
    "we obtained a spectrophotometric calibration by using identically extracted spectra of the standard star hr 6348 ( k0 iii ) and spectral templates of this star prepared using the methods described by @xcite and modified as described by @xcite .",
    "the spectra in both nods and in both sl apertures were calibrated separately and then combined into one spectrum .",
    "this method generally results in very high precision within a single spectrum , indicated by the error bars in our plots , and an absolute photometric accuracy of @xmath210% or better .",
    "we have modified the s11.0 version of the wavelength calibration , as described by @xcite .",
    "this modification shifts the wavelength calibration in sl order 1 by 0.04  to the blue .",
    "we estimate that our wavelengths are accurate to better than 0.02  .",
    "figure 1 presents the spectra of our four haebe stars ( with the spectrum of hd 135344 divided by 10 to fit on the same plot with the other three ) .",
    "the figure includes error bars which are generally smaller than the vertical widths of the lines used to plot the spectra .",
    "these errors are the formal uncertainty in the mean of the spectra from the two nod positions in the sl slit ( half the absolute value of the difference ) . with the notable exception of hd 141569 , which appears to have a single cool component peaking at 40  , the seds in our sample consist of a combination of a warm component peaking in the near infrared ( @xmath22  ) and a cooler component peaking at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this double - peaked structure may indicate that the disks have formed significant gaps between a warm inner disk and a cool outer disk .",
    "the wavelength of the dip in intensity between the warm and cool components shifts slightly from star to star .",
    "thus three of the spectra are flat because the wavelength region observed by sl lies more in the dip between these two components .",
    "the continuum of hd 135344 appears blue because its dip appears towards longer wavelengths than the other sources and is therefore dominated by the warm component ( @xmath3 k ) at the short wavelength end of our spectrum .",

    "we have used line segments as a rough estimate of the continuum under each feature .",
    "we anchor the line segment to the spectrum on either side of each feature and integrate the residual spectrum between the two anchor points to determine the total flux in the feature ( in w m@xmath4 ) .",
    "table 2 lists the wavelength intervals used to fit each feature .",
    "this method assumes that the pah emission is optically thin , and it avoids dependencies on more sophisticated techniques to model the continuum .",
    "hd 135344 is the exception ; before extracting the features using line segments , we first fit a polynomial estimate of the continuum to the spectrum between the features and subtract it .",
    "we have avoided the problem of separating the pah features from other dust features like amorphous silicate emission at 10  or crystalline silicate emission at 11.2   by choosing our sample carefully .",
    "the primary uncertainty is how much of the emission _ below _",
    "the line segments belongs to the underlying pah emission plateaux and how much belongs to the feature we are measuring . if we are truncating flux from a pah feature , we are doing so consistently to all of the stars in the sample , and our relative measurements should remain valid .",

    "the nominal 7.77.9  feature is shifted to 7.9  ( or further ) in our sample , so for the remainder of the paper , we will refer to this feature as the 7.9  feature .",

    "it could be more properly described as the total pah flux from 7 to 9  .",
    "we estimated the central wavelength of each feature by finding the wavelength at which half the emission lies to the blue and the red and by fitting gaussians .",

    "the top panel illustrates pah spectra of classes a , b , and c as defined by @xcite , using as prototypes iras 03260 + 3111 ( a young stellar object in the ngc 1333 molecular cloud core ) , hd 44719 , ( the red rectangle ) , and afgl 2688 ( the cygnus egg ) , respectively .",

    "the sws spectra of afgl 2688 and hd 100546 have steep red continua ; to isolate the pah spectrum we first fit a polynomial to the continuum and subtracted it .",
    "figure 3 and the middle panel of figure 5 show that our haebe stars have spectral features typical of class b , with the 6.2  feature shifted to at least 6.26  , and the peak emission in the 7.67.9  region falling near 7.9  .",
    "both the 6.2 and 7.9  features arise from c@xmath0c stretching modes .",
    "the 8.6  feature , which is included in our measurements of the strength of the 7.9   feature , probably arises from a c@xmath0h in - plane bending mode .",
    "the sample examined by @xcite includes two isolated haebe stars , hd 100546 and hd 179218 , both of which they included with the class b pah spectra .",

    ", this feature appears at 7.8  , but in all four of the irs spectra , this feature lies closer to 8.0  .",
    "thus , in five of the six isolated haebe stars studied here or by @xcite , the 7.87.9  feature indicative of class b is shifted nearly to 8.0  .",
    "the haebe stars may represent a subgroup within class b.    other features visible in the spectra in figure 1 in the 58  range require comment as well .",
    "the 5.2   pah emission feature appears in three of the spectra at the short - wavelength cut - off , but it is absent in hd 34282 .",
    "two of the spectra , hd 34282 and hd 169142 , show spectral structure in the vicinity of 7  which is due to emission features at 6.85 and 7.25  .",
    "@xcite made the first detection of absorption features at 6.85 and 7.25  , which they attributed to c@xmath0h stretching modes in aliphatic hydrocarbons such as methyl or methylene groups .",
    "this discovery was made in the sws spectrum of sgr a*. @xcite detected the 6.85  band in emission in the haebe star hd 163296 .",
    "@xcite recently reported the 6.85 and 7.25  bands in absorption in the spectrum of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy iras f00183 - 7111 , and they showed that laboratory data of hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hacs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide a good match .",
    "we note that the 3.4  interstellar absorption band , identified as an aliphatic c@xmath0h stretching mode @xcite , can also appear in emission @xcite .",
    "it is likely , therefore , that we have observed these aliphatic hac features in emission in hd 34282 and hd 169142 .",
    "the spectrum of hd 135344 contains a much stronger contribution from a warm ( @xmath3 k ) underlying the pahs , making the shape and position of the weaker pah features much more susceptible to any systematic problems with the extraction and calibration of the spectrum , which explains the larger error bars in its spectrum in figure 3 .",
    "nonetheless , some differences from the other spectra in the sample are still apparent .    in the 79  region ,",
    "hd 135344 shows a plateau extending from 8.0 to 8.2  , most likely a blend of peaks at these two wavelengths .",
    "the 8.0  peak is similar to that seen in four of the other haebe stars , but the 8.2  peak more closely resembles class c pah spectra @xcite .",
    "both of the objects in this class , afgl 2688 and iras 13416 - 6243 , are post - agb objects , and neither show an 8.6  feature .",
    "hd 135344 has more emission shortward of 8.0  than these two objects , but the missing 8.6  feature is striking .    the spectrum of hd 135344 differs from the other haebe stars in other ways .",
    "the 11.3  feature is shifted by at least 0.06  to the red ; this is too large to arise from the random pointing errors which occasionally place a star off the central axis of the irs slit .",
    "hd 135344 also has a relatively weak contribution 6.0  ( compared to 6.3  ) .",
    "@xcite attributed the 6.0  satellite of the 6.2  feature to a weak c@xmath0c mode , but we note that in the objects studied by @xcite the strength of the 6.0  feature shows no correlation with that of the 6.2  c@xmath0c mode .",
    "a correlation between the strength of the two bands also seems absent in our sample .",
    "@xcite speculated that the 6.0  feature arises from c@xmath0o stretching modes in oxygenated pah species , but these modes generally peak at somewhat shorter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the carrier of the 6.0  feature remains uncertain .",
    "@xcite have revised the spectral classification of hd 135344 from a0 v @xcite to f4 ve , and @xcite have confirmed this new spectral type .",
    "it is interesting that this source , which is significantly cooler than the other three sources in the sample , is the one which shows the most unusual pah emission in the 8  region .",
    "the relative strengths of pah features can be used to identify the degree of ionization of the pahs .",
    "they may therefore provide clues to the incident radiation field , electron densisty , and gas temperature .",
    "the most obvious difference between neutral and ionized pahs is the relative strength of the c@xmath0c modes in the 7.77.9  region to the out - of - plane c@xmath0h bending modes at 11.3  and longer wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ionized pahs emit more strongly in the features at 69  than in the 1013  region , while in neutral pahs , the 1013   region dominates .",
    "the models of @xcite show that the ratio @xmath10 increases with the size of the pah molecule since larger pahs generally have a higher c : h ratio ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    ". however , a shift from neutrals to ions increases the ratio much more significantly , by a factor of @xmath210 .",
    "we can thus use the ratio of the strengths of the 7.9 and 11.3  features as an estimate for the relative degree of ionization in each spectrum .",
    "this ratio is the most obvious difference among the spectra in our sample , varying from 7.4 in hd 169142 to 25.2 in hd 141569 , making these the least and most ionized pah spectra , respectively .",
    "the ratios for the intermediate stars are 9.1 for hd 135344 and 15.2 for hd 34282 .",
    "recent optical spectroscopy by @xcite confirms the previous revision of the spectral classification of hd 135344 , as discussed above , and also revises the classification of hd 169142 from b9 v @xcite to a5 ve .",
    "these new classifications correlate with the observed ionization fractions as measured by the @xmath10 ratio , with the two a0 stars having the more ionized spectra , and the later - type stars having the less ionized spectra .    in hd 141569 , according to detailed models @xcite , the charging of pahs is dominated by collisions with electrons and not by emitting photoelectrons .",
    "the electron recombination rate is three orders of magnitude larger than the photoelectron emission rate . for this case , then , the pahs are negatively charged .",
    "our analysis is not sensitive to the polarity of the charge of the pahs , only the ionization fraction .",
    "there is no clear explanation for the varying strengths of the components of the 79  pah complex among observed sources .",
    "@xcite investigate two possible causes in their study of the spatial distribution of the components in extended reflection nebulae .",
    "the peak of the complex might shift from 7.6 to 7.9  as the fraction of pah cations increases or as the fraction of fresh and unprocessed pahs increases .",
    "our sample shows a range of ionization fractions , but in three of the four spectra , the shape of the 79   complex looks similar .",
    "the ratio of the 7.9  and 11.3  features varies by a factor of 3.7 in these three sources , and yet the relative contributions of the 7.6 and 7.9  components seems fixed , which would suggest that the components are not sensitive to ionization , at least over the ionization range we have examined .",
    "the size of the pah molecules may also influence the relative strengths of the features at 7.6 and 7.9  , but there is some disagreement over how the position of the strongest feature in this wavelength range will depend on pah size .",
    "@xcite suggest that very small grains produce the longer - wavelength feature , but @xcite report that their laboratory measurements show that the 7.6  feature shifts to longer wavelength for _ larger _ pahs .",
    "we can only say that our data are least consistent with the dependence of the 79  pah complex on ionization fraction .",
    "the models of @xcite show a dependence of the ratio @xmath11 on the size of the pah molecule , but it is weak , with the flux ratio doubling only when the number of c atoms has been reduced by a factor of @xmath210 .",
    "the top panel of figure 6 shows that the ratio @xmath11 varies by a factor of two in our sample , but not in any systematic way with the ionization fraction as indicated by @xmath10 .",
    "traces the ionization fraction of the pahs . from left to right ( least to most ionized ) , the symbols are for hd 169142 ( a5 ) , hd 135344 ( f4 ) , hd 34282 ( a0 ) , and hd 141569 ( a0 ) . in the top panel ,",
    "the relative strengths of the 6.2 and 7.9  features vary by a factor of @xmath22 , but they do not vary systematically with ionization fraction .",
    "the bottom panel shows that the ratio @xmath12 increases with ionization fraction , suggesting that the size of the pahs decreases with ionization fraction.,width=336 ]    to better discriminate the size of the pah molecules , @xcite use the ratio @xmath12 .",
    "the 11.3  feature arises from a c@xmath0h stretching mode when an aromatic ring contains only one h atom , such as one might find along the edge of a large pah molecule .",
    "the 12.7  feature arises from the c@xmath0h trio stretching mode , i.e. from aromatic rings with three h atoms , which will be found on the corners and ends of pah molecules .",
    "as one increases the size of a pah molecule , the strength of the emission at 11.3  will increase with respect to the emission at 12.7  .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 6 shows that the strength of the 12.7  feature generally increases with the ionization fraction . comparing this panel with the top panel",
    "reveals that the use of the ratios @xmath11 and @xmath12 as size indicators gives contradictory results .",
    "the @xmath12 ratio may be influenced not just by the size of the pahs , but by their geometry .",
    "if a compact pah is rearranged into a structure with the same number of carbon atoms but with more uneven edges , the strength of the duo and trio modes will increase compared to the solo mode .",
    "thus , it is possible that the the enhancement of the 12.7  feature could also arise from more irregularly shaped and less compact pahs .",
    "measurements at the astrochemistry laboratory at nasa ames research center have revealed no dependency of the @xmath11 ratio on the size of the pahs ( hudgins 2004 , private communication ) , but the astrochemistry laboratory has not explored a full order of magnitude in pah size . while larger pahs , such as those modeled by @xcite , do show a dependence , typical pah sizes are on the order of @xmath2100 carbon atoms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the range in pah sizes may be insufficient to dominate other causes for variation in the strength of the 6.2 and 7.9  bands .",
    "the relative strengths of the out - of - plane c@xmath0h bending modes , on the other hand , are much more sensitive to variations in pah size , especially for the sizes of the molecules likely to be encountered in typical astrophysical environments .",
    "the spectra of our haebe stars show other emission features in the 1113  region in addition to the 11.3 and 12.7  features . in figures 1 and 4 ,",
    "the duet out - of - plane c@xmath0h bending mode at 11.9  is visible in all of the spectra except hd 135344 .",
    "these figures also show that what we are measuring as the 12.7  feature shows some structure . in the spectrum of hd 141569 ,",
    "the secondary emission peak at 12.4  actually dominates the 12.7  feature .",
    "the humphreys-@xmath13 line should be at 12.365  , but there is no corresponding pfund-@xmath13 line at 7.46  .",
    "the h@xmath14 00 s(2 ) is expected at 12.28  , but this is too far to the blue and it is not accompanied by the 00 s(3 ) line at 9.67  .",
    "the most likely carrier of the 12.4  feature is another trio out - of - plane bending mode , as this feature can vary from 12.1 to 13.5  , depending on the pah molecule ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "spitzer _ of four herbig aebe stars whose spectra show strong pah emission but no silicate dust features . the absence of silicate emission has enabled a detailed analysis independent of specific disk models of the relative strengths and positions of pah emission features in the 514  region .",
    "our sample shows spectral characteristics generally consistent with the class b pah emission sources identified by @xcite , viz .",
    "a 6.2  feature shifted to 6.3  and 79  emission dominated by the component at 7.9  .",
    "however , in all of our sources , the 7.9  feature is shifted closer to 8.0  , as in the spectrum of hd 100546 , a haebe star observed by the sws on _",
    "iso_.    the spectra show a range in ionization fraction as revealed by the @xmath10 ratio , with hd 141569 showing the highest degree of ionization and hd 169142 the lowest . the ionization fraction is lower for later spectral classes . the strength of the 12.7  feature increases with respect to the 11.3  feature as the ionization fraction increases .",
    "the strength of the 6.2  feature relative to the 7.9  feature varies by a factor of nearly two in our sample , but in no systematic way .",
    "the spectrum of hd 135344 , the coolest star in our sample , resembles the class c spectra discussed by @xcite in some ways , with more emission to the red of 7.9   than in the other sources and a missing 8.6  feature .",
    "thus , our sample of pah spectra from haebe stars show some characteristics which reinforce results from the literature , but also raise new questions .",
    "why do haebe stars consistently produce the class b pah spectra seen in less than 25% of the sws sample ? what causes the shift of the 7.9  feature to @xmath28.0  ?",
    "what causes the range of 6.2  feature strengths compared to the 7.9  feature ? what is the carrier of the 6.0  feature",
    "? answering these questions will help us understand the nature of the haebe systems from which the pah emission arises .",
    "quantitative measures of the size and ionization fraction of the pahs would be valuable in determining the degree of grain processing in the disks and the fraction of short - wavelength stellar photons that reach the outer disks . with the small size of the current sample , it is not possible to determine the origin of the correlations ,",
    "although we expect that the full irs sample of haebe stars will bring us closer to this goal .",

    "<S> we present spectra of four herbig aebe stars obtained with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on the _ spitzer space telescope_. all four of the sources show strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , with the 6.2  emission feature shifted to 6.3  and the strongest c@xmath0c skeletal - mode feature occuring at 7.9  instead of at 7.7  as is often seen . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , none of the four stars have silicate emission . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the 7.9  feature varies with respect to the 11.3  feature among the sources , indicating that we have observed pahs with a range of ionization fractions . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization fraction is higher for systems with hotter and brighter central stars . </S>",
    "<S> two sources , hd 34282 and hd 169142 , show emission features from aliphatic hydrocarbons at 6.85 and 7.25  . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of hd 141569 shows a previously undetected emission feature at 12.4  which may be related to the 12.7  pah feature . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of hd 135344 , the coolest star in our sample , shows an unusual profile in the 79  region , with the peak emission to the red of 8.0  and no 8.6  pah feature . </S>"
