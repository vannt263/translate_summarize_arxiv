    "the interaction of rare - gas and metal clusters with intense laser light has drawn close attention during the last ten years .",
    "reasons for this large interest are ( among others ) the high charge states @xcite and the high energies of both ions @xcite and electrons @xcite observed ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .    the laser - cluster interaction scenario may be qualitatively summarized as follows .",
    "electrons leave their `` parent '' atoms ( `` inner ionization '' ) and absorb further laser energy while moving in the cluster potential formed by the ionic background .",
    "some electrons may leave the cluster ( `` outer ionization '' ) , leaving behind a net positively charged nanoplasma .",
    "the total electric field consists of the laser plus the space charge field .",
    "it may exceed the pure laser field in certain spatial regions and thus may liberate further electrons from their parent ions ( which would remain bound if there was the laser field alone ) .",
    "this enhanced inner ionization is called `` ionization ignition '' @xcite .",
    "ionization ignition locally continues until the total field drops below the threshold field required to liberate further electrons .",
    "the ionic background expands because of coulomb repulsion and hydrodynamic pressure , which ultimately leads to the energetic ions observed in experiments . because of the complex interplay between inner ionization , outer ionization , and ionic expansion it is far from trivial to predict quantitatively mean or highest charge states , the absorbed laser energy , or other observables and their dependence on the laser parameters and the cluster decomposition .",
    "one of the goals in laser - cluster experiments and simulations is to convert as much laser energy as possible into energetic particles .",
    "this can be achieved by optimizing the outer ionization degree , i.e. , by removing as many electrons as possible from the cluster in order to generate high charge states so that the asymptotic ion energy ( and thus the total absorbed energy ) after coulomb explosion is largest .    one way to increase the charge states and",
    "the ion energy is to dope a cluster with atomic / molecular species of low ionization potential @xcite .",
    "an almost two - fold increase of the highest charge states were obtained experimentally with argon clusters doped with water molecules @xcite .",
    "experimental results for xenon and silver clusters embedded in helium droplets were reported in ref .",
    "the pulse duration and the sign of the chirp of a laser - pulse also affect ion charge states and ion energies @xcite .",
    "enhanced inner ionization of rare - gas and metal clusters irradiated by a sequence of dual laser pulses were observed @xcite experimentally . in these kinds of experiments",
    "one should adjust the delay time between pump and probe pulse such that the cluster expands sufficiently to meet the linear resonance @xmath0 with the probe pulse , where @xmath1 is the mie - plasmon frequency and @xmath2 is the laser frequency .",
    "vlasov simulations @xcite and semi - classical simulations @xcite of a small @xmath3 cluster subject to such a pump - probe setup showed an enhancement of the ion charge states .",
    "an optimum control multi - pulse simulation has also been performed @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the effect of the laser wavelength by three - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations .",
    "the goal is to find an optimum wavelength for a fixed laser intensity and a given cluster . at this optimum wavelength ( which turns out to be in the ultraviolet ( uv ) regime for the xe clusters under consideration ) a single ultrashort laser pulse",
    "is shown to be much more efficient than the `` conventional '' dual - pulse pump - probe setup .",
    "experimental signatures of enhanced x - ray yields and high charge states at short wavelengths @xcite indicate a clear impact of the laser wavelength on the laser - cluster interaction .",
    "free electron laser ( fel ) cluster experiments @xcite at the desy facility , hamburg , and a recent x - ray laser - cluster experiment @xcite down to wavelengths @xmath4  nm also showed enhanced ionization .",
    "contrary to our findings recent molecular dynamics simulations @xcite concluded that ( i ) there is no influence of the laser wavelength on the charging of clusters in the regime @xmath5  nm for a laser intensity @xmath6 and ( ii ) that linear resonance plays no role , thus threatening the basis of the nanoplasma model @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions were reported by the same authors in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider short laser pulses in this work .",
    "most of the earlier works were reported for the long - pulse regime where linear resonance ( lr ) absorption @xcite occurs during the expanding phase of a cluster when the mie - plasma frequency drops sufficiently so that the laser frequency can be met . at the time of lr the space charge field inside the cluster",
    "is strongly enhanced , leading to efficient ionization ignition .",

    "is clearly affirmative .",
    "as regards the ionization model ( ii ) , at short wavelengths ionization rather proceeds via multiphoton ionization than via tunneling or over - the - barrier ionization so that the bethe - model ( where the ionization probability switches from zero to unity once a certain threshold field is reached ) may not yield the precise charging dynamics of the clusters at short wavelengths .",
    "however , the final charge state distribution should remain unaffected by the details of the ionization model @xcite at least qualitatively .",
    "only collisionless absorption mechanisms are incorporated in standard pic simulations .",
    "the neglect of particle collisions is an approximation which is the more valid the smaller the clusters , the higher the laser intensities , and the longer the laser wavelengths are ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . since collisions can be expected to increase both energy absorption and ionization , our results from collisionless pic calculations may be considered close to reality for wavelengths @xmath14 nm but slightly underestimating the real charge states and the real absorbed energy for shorter wavelengths .",

    "[ fig3ch5 ] .",
    "higher charge states @xmath164 are not produced because of the high threshold field @xmath165 necessary to crack the m - shell .",
    "one may argue that the presence of @xmath124 electrons inside the cluster ( in fig .",
    "[ fig4ch5]b ) will deplete the field inside significantly .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that at resonance the electron cloud oscillates with a large excursion , exposing a substantial part of the naked ionic background , leading to an enhanced `` dynamical ionization ignition '' @xcite which can produce higher charge states than expected from the laser field alone even inside the cluster . finally , after @xmath166  cycles @xmath138 at the boundary drops due to the cluster expansion . as expected , the phases plotted in fig .",

    "[ fig3ch5 ] for both pulses .",
    "[ fig8ch5 ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    even in the optimal @xmath96 nm case presented so far only @xmath172 of the generated electrons were removed from the cluster ( visible in fig .",
    "[ fig4ch5]b )",
    ". therefore outer ionization and ionization ignition was certainly not optimized .",
    "we argued that even if the remaining @xmath124 electrons were removed , the average charge state would not be significantly increased as compared to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3ch5]a . to prove that , we performed pic simulations for the same cluster and the same peak intensity but now employing two consecutive pulses ( shown in fig .  [ fig8ch5 ] ) .",
    "the first pulse of resonant wavelength @xmath96 nm with respect to the still compact cluster is ramped up over four @xmath173nm - cycles and held constant afterwards up to 8  cycles ( the details of how the pulse is ramped down do not matter ; therefore it is simply switched off abruptly ) . at @xmath174  cycles a second pulse",
    "is switched on ( over 2  cycles ) whose frequency is resonant with the mie - frequency around @xmath175  cycles .",
    "after the first pulse the cluster doubled its radius , and the outer ionization degree amounts to @xmath176 so that @xmath177 electrons are still inside the cluster of radius @xmath71 while @xmath178 are inside a sphere of radius @xmath171 . the average charge @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig8ch5]b does not change significantly compared to fig .",
    "[ fig3ch5]a although the pulse energy per unit area @xmath179 is @xmath180 times higher .    the purpose of the second pulse shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8ch5]b is the removal of the residual electrons .",
    "although almost @xmath181 outer ionization within the expanding radius @xmath170 and @xmath182 within @xmath171 are achieved , no higher charge states are created .",
    "the absorbed energy also does not rise significantly so that the higher input energy invested into the two pulses does not pay off .",
    "hence a single , short uv - pulse of wavelength @xmath96  nm turns out to be optimal with respect to fractional energy absorption and generation of a high average charge state under the conditions considered .",
    "in summary , we studied the interaction of xenon clusters with intense short laser pulses using a three - dimensional pic code .",
    "our aim was to optimize for a given cluster the laser energy absorption and the generation of high average charge states .",
    "the latter will then lead to energetic ions upon coulomb explosion .",
    "we showed that for a given laser intensity an optimal laser wavelength exists that , under the typical conditions studied in this work , lies in the uv regime .",
    "energy absorption is optimized when resonance is met during an early stage of the dynamics when the cluster is still compact .",
    "the conventional , long - pulse linear resonance during the expansion of the cluster is less efficient .",
