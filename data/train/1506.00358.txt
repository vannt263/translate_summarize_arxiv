    "due to recent progresses in multi - electrode recording techniques in experimental neuroscience , the neural activity measurement of a population of increasing number of neurons becomes possible  @xcite , which provides a large opportunity and also a big challenge for the large - scale data analysis or dimensionality reduction  @xcite , to understand how sensory processing , working memory or decision making arises from neural circuits .",
    "however , the brain region the current recording techniques can measure is very limited , therefore , the measured population of neurons is not completely isolated .",
    "still there are many unobserved neurons outside this population ( some may be upstream neurons ) , but interacting with neurons inside the observed population  @xcite .",
    "the inferred interactions from the neural data are usually termed functional or effective connectivity , since the data fitting captures only part of the statistical features of the spike train data for algorithmic simplicity .",
    "recently , there appear intensive research interests on the inference problem of a random kinetic ising model with hidden nodes  @xcite .",
    "however , a systematic study of the effects of hidden nodes on the structure inference is still lacking based on widely used equilibrium models . here , we explore these effects based on the maximal entropy model ( also called the disordered ising model ) extensively used to model and fit the neural data in recent studies  @xcite .",
    "we separate an unobserved part of network ( a hidden subnetwork ) from the full model , and probe the effects of hidden nodes first in small systems with a few nodes where the analytic study is available , then in large systems where we performed extensive numerical simulations under various settings .",
    "in fact , the correlation observed between two neurons may arise from a hidden common input outside the measured population .",
    "in addition , the interaction between two neurons may be mediated by a chain of unobserved neurons .",
    "how the unobserved part of the network affects the final inference quality will be the focus of this paper .    for a model study ,",
    "the data used for inference are collected with high quality , such that the final result does not strongly depend on the inference method . in numerical simulations",
    ", we used the naive mean - field ( nmf ) method  @xcite to reconstruct the interaction strengths between neurons in the observed network .",
    "nmf relies simply on the inverse of the correlation matrix , which is also suitable for analytic studies of small systems with a few nodes . for small systems",
    ", we found that the effective field of observed neurons receiving a common input increases with the external field ( firing bias ) applied to the hidden input , while neurons interacting directly with the hidden input show different behavior from those that do not have a direct interaction .",
    "the effective couplings between neurons receiving a common input decreases with increasing firing bias of the hidden input .",
    "however , the neurons without a direct interaction ( with the hidden input ) seem to be unaffected in terms of their inferred coupling values . furthermore ,",
    "if two neurons are mediated by a chain of hidden neurons , the inferred interaction strength decreases with increasing chain length .",
    "insights gained from the small size network are confirmed in numerical simulations of large size networks , from which , we showed that the inference performance deteriorates with increasing size of the unobserved network , and enhanced coupling strengthes between neurons in the unobserved part will increase the inference error for both the couplings and fields .",
    "interestingly , if we increase the field strength of the unobserved neurons , the inference of couplings for the observed neurons will be improved , while the quality of the field inference still deteriorates .",

    "will also increase the effective field of the boundary neurons which show different behavior from those neurons inside the observed part .",
    "all these interesting properties are also observed in numerical simulations of large networks .",
    "the inference quality for both couplings and fields deteriorates as the size of the unobserved part grows , which can be explained by the fact that an increasing number of hidden neurons causes higher - order correlations in the observed data and furthermore a larger deviation of the inferred coupling from its true value , mimicking a glassy phase arising in observed networks .",
    "interestingly , increasing field variance of hidden neurons improves the inference quality of the effective couplings , but worsens the quality for the effective fields .",
    "in addition , attenuated coupling strengthes involved in at least one hidden neuron lead to high quality of coupling inference .",
    "our work demonstrates the hidden part in a full network does have a significant influence on the inference quality of the observed network structure ( for both poisson graph and scale - free graph ) , showing many interesting properties , as revealed in both small networks and large networks .",
    "as new advanced experimental recording techniques are proposed , the number of measured neurons becomes larger and larger , providing greater challenges for large - scale neural data analysis .",
    "the effects of hidden neurons on the inference quality , based on a toy model study in this paper , provide insights towards understanding the interaction between observed part and unobserved part in terms of network structure prediction .",
    "another interesting extension of the current work is to consider the potts model which is widely used in protein structure prediction  @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
