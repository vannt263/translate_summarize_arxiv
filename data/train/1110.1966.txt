    "a prediction of the neutrino beam content at the t2k ( @xcite , @xcite ) far detector is given in table [ beam - content - far ] .",
    "the @xmath0 flux is predominantly ( @xmath1% ) produced by the decay in flight of positively charged pions focused by the magnetic horns of the beamline . while @xmath2% of the @xmath3 flux is produced from the decay of positively charged kaons , @xmath4% of it",
    "is due to muons produced in the decay of the same charged pions that generate the @xmath0 flux .",
    "thus , in a first stage , pion production data will constrain both @xmath0 and @xmath3 fluxes .    in terms of hadron production measurements",
    ", the pion contribution to the @xmath0 flux at the far detector can be decomposed into a _",
    "direct _ component and a _",
    "target _ component .",
    "the first contribution originates from pions directly produced in the proton primary interaction ( secondary pions ) or in the decay of a secondary particle .",
    "the _ target _",
    "contribution refers to all pions exiting the target or pions produced in the decay of an outgoing particle .",
    "the dependence of these contributions on the neutrino energy is depicted in fig .",
    "[ motivations ] ( left and middle panels ) .",
    "while the direct component contributes to @xmath5% of the @xmath0 flux at the beam peak energy of @xmath6  mev , the target component contributes to @xmath7% of the flux .",
    "thus , thin target measurements ( @xmath8 at 30 gev ) for t2k constrain up to 60% of the @xmath0 flux prediction at the far detector , the remaining 40% being produced in secondary interactions in the target and elements of the beamline .",
    "long target measurements would constrain up to 90% of the flux prediction . in this case , only 10% of the flux due to secondary interactions out of the target would require constraints from other data .",

    "current error envelopes for the @xmath0 flux at the far detector [ right ] ( for the analysis described in @xcite).,title=\"fig : \" ]    as depicted in fig .",
    "[ motivations ] ( right panel ) , the total fractional error on the t2k @xmath0 flux prediction ( @xcite , @xcite ) at the far detector is @xmath9% at the beam peak energy .",
    "uncertainties arise from two main contributions : uncertainties related to the beamline setting ( e.g. beam optics , beam direction , alignment and currents of the focusing horns ) and those related to the re - weighting procedure based on the na61/shine thin target data ( within 5 to 10  % ) @xcite .",
    "the fractional error at the beam peak energy is dominated by uncertainties from the second contribution ( i.e. pion / kaon multiplicity , secondary nucleon multiplicity and production cross sections ) .",
    "in particular , uncertainties on the re - weighting of secondary nucleon and production cross sections for secondary interactions are applied to @xmath10% ( @xmath11% ) of the flux in the case of the thin ( long ) target based re - weighting .",
    "these uncertainties rely on interpolation between sparse data sets or comparison to models and are often poorly known . in the case where flux predictions are re - weighted by long target data ,",
    "these contributions are taken into account at once and there is no need for error prone estimates of secondary interactions in the target .",
    "long target data are therefore needed to obtain a precision of 5% or better on the absolute flux prediction .",
    "the 2007 na61/shine pilot data were taken with a replica of the t2k target at 30 gev beam energy .",
    "the na61/shine spectrometer consists in a set of 5 time projection chambers ( tpcs ) complemented by an array of time - of - flight ( tof ) detectors located downstream of the tpcs , allowing for a full coverage of the forward pion production of interest for t2k ( i.e. phase space of pions exiting the target and producing neutrinos in the direction of the near and far detectors ) . details of the experimental setup are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the trajectory of each beam proton track is reconstructed with a set of beam position detectors that allow to determine the position of the beam impact on the upstream face of the target .",
    "the usage of the tof in the analysis assures that selected tracks in the tpcs originate from single proton interactions in the target .",
    "data can therefore be normalized to the total number of protons on target ( pot ) .",
    "tracks reconstructed in the tpcs are extrapolated back through the magnetic field from their first measured point to the surface of the target .",
    "a point - of - closest - approach is found between the trajectory of the track and the surface of the target .",
    "this requires a precise knowledge of the relative alignment of the beam and target , which is determined by using both beam and tpc tracks . for the 2007 pilot run ,",
    "the target was tilted with respect to the beam axis in both horizontal ( @xmath12 mrad ) and vertical ( @xmath13 mrad ) directions .",
    "the misalignment was taken into account in the extrapolation procedure and effects on the outgoing pion yields ( additional systematic uncertainty ) studied with dedicated monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the target is split into 5 bins of 18 cm each along the beam ( z axis ) , and a last bin corresponding to the dowstream face of the target that covers the very forward ( below 40 mrad ) pion production .",
    "analysis cuts are optimized to improve the momentum and polar angle resolutions at the first measured point on track that determine the achievable resolutions on target , estimated to @xmath14 cm , @xmath15% and @xmath16% for the longitudinal , momentum and polar angle resolutions respectively . as depicted in fig .",

    "the combination of the two signals provides a powerful pid over a large momentum range .",
    "yields of positively charged pions exiting the target are extracted in bins of @xmath22 using a 2d - likelihood minimization ( see fig .  [ reconstruction ] , middle and right panels ) .",
    "[ tuning ] shows that such yields can effectively be measured at the surface of the target .",
    "the fluka simulation package @xcite used in the t2k beam simulation was interfaced to the na61/shine simulation chain for which a pid based on data parametrizations was furthermore implemented .",
    "data and monte - carlo are processed identically with the same reconstruction chain and pid analysis .",
    "thus , reconstructed yields of positively charged pions can be compared to reconstructed monte - carlo predictions prior to any corrections necessary to get absolute yields ( e.g. all monte - carlo based corrections such as acceptance and decay corrections , reconstruction efficiency , etc ) .",
    "such a comparison is depicted in fig .",
    "[ tuning ] ( top left panel ) with the corresponding re - weighting factors ( top right panel ) , defined as the ratio of data to monte - carlo yields .",
    "current uncertainties on the re - weighting factors are dominated by the statistical uncertainty which is typically 10% due to the very poor statistics of the 2007 pilot data .",
    "systematic uncertainties are within 5 - 10% , the dominant source being pid ( 1 - 5% ) , followed by target misalignment ( 3% ) and normalization ( 1.4% ) .",

    "<S> the na61/shine collaboration performed measurements of pc interactions at 31  gev / c beam momentum with a full size replica of the t2k target ( 1.9 interaction length ) during a pilot run in 2007 . </S>",
    "<S> larger statistics runs were also conducted in 2009 and 2010 . </S>",
    "<S> the na61/shine setup consists in a large acceptance spectrometer located on the h2 beamline of the sps at cern . for the first time , the kinematical phase space of interest for an accelerator based neutrino experiment ( i.e. kinematical phase space of pions / kaons exiting the target and producing neutrinos in the direction of the near and far detectors ) is fully covered by a single hadron production experiment . in a first stage , yields of positively charged pions were measured at the surface of the target . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the 2007 data set presented here demonstrates that * a ) * high quality long target data were successfully taken with the na61/shine apparatus , and * b ) * for the first time , the t2k neutrino flux predictions can effectively be re - weighted with the na61/shine long target data . + _ invited paper to nufact11 , xiiith international workshop on neutrino factories , super beams and beta beams , 1 - 6 aug . </S>",
