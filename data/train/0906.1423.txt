    "it is convenient to scale it with its typical length and time scales . noting that the characteristic length scale of the system is the electron skin depth @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electron plasma frequency , and that the typical time scale is the plasma inhomogeneity length scale divided by the thermal speed of the electrons @xcite , it is possible to cast the system ( [ emhd2])([energy2 ] ) into the dimensionless form @xmath26 and @xmath27 where we have normalized the spatial coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath28 by the electron skin depth @xmath29 , the time by @xmath30 , the magnetic field by @xmath31 , and the temperature fluctuations @xmath5 by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the electron thermal speed .",

    "the unstable case @xmath58 corresponds to a situation where density and temperature gradients are in the same direction and @xmath59 .",
    "this instability gives rise to the generation of magnetic field fluctuations and is related to the first order baroclinic ( @xmath60 ) effect , which shows the importance of the temperature fluctuations for the instability to take place @xcite .",

    "the energy integral is positive definite , and thus does not allow the growing of large amplitude magnetic fluctuations from small - amplitude noise . for @xmath40 , however , the energy integral is non - definite and allows large - amplitude waves to grow from the linear instability discussed above .",
    "we have adapted the nonlinear fluid code that was developed to study the evolution of medv modes in @xcite in the presence of equilibrium electron density and temperature gradients , to also include a background gradient in the magnetic field .",
    "consequently , the energy stored in these gradients excite linear as well as nonlinear instabilities in a different manner , than that described in @xcite , because the nonlinear mode coupling interactions are significantly modified by the presence of both plasma and magnetic field gradients .",
    "our numerical code employs a doubly periodic spectral discretization of magnetic field and temperature fluctuations in terms of its fourier components , while nonlinear interactions are de - convoluted back and forth in real and fourier spectral spaces .",
    "the time integration is performed by using the 4th - order runge - kutta method .",
    "a fixed time integration step is used .",
    "the conservation of energy given by ( [ integral ] ) is used to check the numerical accuracy and validity of our numerical code during the nonlinear evolution of the magnetic field and temperature fluctuations .",

    "we also make sure that the initial fluctuations are isotropic and do not influence any anisotropy during the evolution .",
    "nonlinear interactions can , however , lead to anisotropic turbulent cascades by migrating spectral energy in either @xmath67 or @xmath68 modes .",
    "the preference of energy transfer in either of the modes is determined primarily by the background gradients in magnetic or temperature and density fields that , in nonlinearly saturated state , govern the mode coupling interactions . in our present simulations ,",
    "we largely focus on two cases , viz ( i ) small amplitude and ( ii ) large amplitude evolution of turbulent fluctuations .",
    "these two cases are characteristically different from each other in terms of dominant nonlinear interactions . to compare the effects of the amplitude we need to compare the nonlinear terms ( the vector nonlinearities ) with the linear terms , most importantly the coupling terms between the magnetic field and temperature fluctuations .",
    "hence , we can compare the nonlinear term @xmath69 to the coupling term @xmath70 in the dimensionless eq .",
    "( 6 ) . in the simulations ( figs . 1 and 2 ) we observed that the amplitudes of the dimensionless magnetic field and temperature fluctuations are approximately the same for both the small and large amplitude cases when the turbulence is fully developed .",
    "hence we may use @xmath71 and compare the nonlinear term @xmath69 to @xmath72 . as an order of magnitude estimate , the spatial derivatives are of the order @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the typical length scale of the fluctuations .",
    "hence we have the order of magnitude estimates @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "one can conclude that if @xmath77 then the linear coupling term dominates and we have a case of weak turbulence , while if @xmath78 or larger , then we have a fully nonlinear case with strong turbulence . in our simulations ,",
    "the fluctuations have typical length - scales of @xmath79 ( corresponding to the electron skin depth in dimensional units ) so that @xmath80 constitutes a weakly nonlinear case while @xmath81 is a strongly nonlinear case . in dimensional units ,",
    "@xmath20 should be replaced by @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath74 by @xmath83 so that @xmath84 should be compared to @xmath85 in dimensional units . since @xmath86",
    ", we then have the weakly nonlinear case @xmath87 and the strongly nonlinear case @xmath88 in dimensional units .",
    "( color online ) evolution of random turbulent fluctuations initialized with small amplitude .",
    "nonlinear turbulent interactions lead to the formation of relatively large - scale flow directed along the mean magnetic field in our 2d simulations .",
    "the saturated structures in @xmath4 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are shown in the figure .",
    "the numerical resolution is @xmath92 , box dimension is @xmath93 , and the parameters used are @xmath94 and @xmath95 . ]     ( color online ) when the amplitude of initial fluctuations in magnetic and temperature fields is large enough , characteristic nonlinear interaction modify the flows observed in fig ( 1 ) .",
    "the diamagnetic - like nonlinear interactions seem to dominantly suppress the flow and lead to small scale isotropic turbulent fluctuations .",
    "this is shown in @xmath4 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . ]",
    "the initial spectral distribution in the magnetic and temperature fluctuations comprises a uniform isotropic and random amplitude associated with the fourier modes confined to a smaller band of wave number ( @xmath96 ) . while spectral amplitude of the fluctuations is random for each fourier coefficient ; it follows a @xmath97 or @xmath98 scaling .",
    "note again that our final results do not depend on the choice of the initial spectral distribution .",
    "the spectral distribution set up in this manner initializes random scale turbulent fluctuations .",
    "since there is no external driving mechanism considered in our simulations , turbulence evolves freely under the influence of self - consistent nonlinear interactions .",
    "note however that driven turbulence in the context of the medv mode will not change inertial range spectrum to be described here .",
    "the driving mechanism helps sustain turbulent interactions without modifying the inertial range turbulent cascades .",
    "the initial isotropic fluctuations in magnetic and temperature fields are evolved through nonlinear fluid eqs .",
    "( [ b_norm ] ) & ( [ t1_norm ] ) .",
    "the dominant nonlinear interactions in the inhomogeneous medv modes are governed by @xmath99 in magnetic field equation .",
    "this nonlinearity is similar to the polarization drift nonlinearity @xmath100 , @xmath101 being the electrostatic potential fluctuations , in a two dimensional hasegawa - mima - wakatani ( hmw ) model describing drift waves in inhomogeneous plasmas @xcite .",
    "this nonlinearity characterizes reynolds stress forces that plays a critical role in the formation of zonal - flows .",
    "analogously , one can expect generation of nonlinearly generated flows in underlying medv model here .",
    "the temperature evolution , on the other hand , is governed by @xmath102 nonlinearity that is identical to a diamagnetic nonlinear term in hmw model .",
    "the role of this nonlinearity has traditionally been identified as a source of suppressing the intensity of nonlinear flows in drift wave turbulence .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of the linear inhomogenous background in both equations can modify the nonlinear mode coupling interactions in a subtle manner .",
    "our objective is to understand the latter in the context of nonlinear interactions mediated by the inhomogeneous @xmath4 and @xmath89 fields in medv modes .",
    "we find from our small amplitude nonlinear evolution case ( see fig 1 ) that the nonlinear interactions in the inhomogeneous medv modes are typically led by the reynolds - stress - like nonlinearity , i.e. @xmath99 , in the magnetic field equation .",
    "consequently , the mode structures in the saturated turbulent state are dominated by the zonal - like flows , as typically observed in the hasegawa - mima - wakatani ( hmw ) model @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "( 1 ) where large scale structures ( zonal flow - like , @xmath103 ) along the background magnetic and temperature field gradients are developed in @xmath104 and @xmath91 fluctuations .",
    "thus , small amplitude nonlinear evolution , as shown in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , is consistent with the hmw model of the inhomogeneous drift - wave turbulence .",
    "our simulations described in fig .",
    "( 1 ) can be contrasted with our previous work @xcite on the small amplitude case that was studied in the absence of a background magnetic field gradient . in ref @xcite",
    ", we have shown that mode coupling interactions during the nonlinear stage of evolution leads to the formation of streamer - like structures in the magnetic field fluctuations associated with @xmath105 .",
    "these structures were similar to the zonal flows but contained a rapid @xmath106 variations , thus the corresponding frequency is relatively large .",
    "the temperature fluctuations in fig ( 1 ) of @xcite , on the other hand , depict an admixture of isotropically localized turbulent eddies and a few stretched along the direction of the background inhomogeneity .",
    "clearly , the presence of a background magnetic field gradient reduces the @xmath106 variation in the steady - state flow .",
    "this leads to a considerable modification in the final structures , which now appear to look like zonal - flows ( and not the streamers that were observed in the absence of a background magnetic field ) .",
    "interestingly , the large amplitude case in our simulations unravels a completely different scenario where nonlinear mode coupling interactions in medv modes are observed to suppress the steady - state flow .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "the suppression of the zonal flow - like structures can be understood in the context of the diamagnetic - like nonlinearity that seems to modify the nonlinear mode coupling interactions in the large amplitude evolution .",
    "this nonlinearity , corresponding to a @xmath107 term in the temperature equation , becomes gradually strong enough to nullify the emergence of the large scale zonal - flow - like structures .",
    "hence , the steady state structures in fig .",
    "( 2 ) appear to possess more small scale fully developed turbulent fluctuations .",
    "we confirm that this state is not entirely isotropic and the background gradients nonlinearly maintain the anisotropic cascades in inhomogeneous medv modes .",
    "we elucidate this point in the following section .",
    "( color online ) evolution of anisotropic mode structures as described by @xmath106 and @xmath108 mode averaged over the entire turbulent spectrum in inhomogeneous medv turbulence .",
    "initially , @xmath109 .",
    "progressive development of anisotropy @xmath110 is ascribed to the presence of background gradients in magnetic and temperature fields for which the anisotropy angle @xmath111 deviates continually from @xmath112 . ]",
    "we quantify the degree of anisotropy mediated by the presence of large scale gradients in the magnetic and temperature fields in the nonlinear 2d inhomogeneous medv turbulence . in 2d turbulence ,",
    "the anisotropy in the @xmath113 plane is associated with the preferential transfer of spectral energy that empowers either of the @xmath106 and @xmath108 modes .",
    "the anisotropy in the initial isotropic turbulent spectrum is triggered essentially by the background anisotropic gradients that nonlinearly migrate the spectral energy in a particular direction . to measure the degree of anisotropic cascades , we employ the following diagnostics to monitor the evolution of @xmath106 mode in time .",
    "the @xmath106 mode is determined by averaging over the entire turbulent spectrum that is weighted by @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath114 here @xmath115 represents any of @xmath4 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , the evolution of @xmath108 mode is determined by the following relation .",
    "@xmath116 we can define an angle of anisotropy such that @xmath111 .",
    "it is clear from these expressions that the @xmath106 and @xmath108 modes exhibit isotropy when @xmath117 for which @xmath118 .",
    "any deviation from this equality leads to a spectral anisotropy .",
    "we follow the evolution of @xmath106 and @xmath108 modes in our simulations for increasing amplitude of the initial fluctuations .",
    "our simulation results describing the evolution of @xmath106 and @xmath108 modes are shown in fig .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "3 that the initial isotropic modes @xmath117 gradually evolve towards an highly anisotropic state in that spectral transfer preferentially occurs in the @xmath106 mode , while the same is suppressed in @xmath108 mode . consequently , the spectral transfer in @xmath106 mode dominates the evolution and the mode structures show elongated structures along the @xmath28-direction . with the increasing amplitude of the initial fluctuations",
    ", there exists increasing degree of anisotropy as illustrated in fig 3 . the larger the amplitude is , stronger are the nonlinear interactions .",
    "correspondingly , there exists increasing degree of disparity in the @xmath106 and @xmath108 modes owing primarily to the increasing depletion in @xmath108 modes as shown in fig 3 .",
    "( color online ) energy associated with the anisotropic flows that corresponds essentially to the nonlinear @xmath54 modes .",
    "figure depicts the self - consistently generated nonlinear flows lead to turbulent anisotropy .",
    "the growth rate of the generation of anisotropic flow is directly proportional to the amplitude of the initial fluctuations . ]",
    "the increasing angle of anisotropy ( in fig 3 ) , with the increasing magnitude of the initial fluctuations , is ascribed to the generation of highly asymmetric flows in our simulations .",
    "we exemplify this point by means of fig 4 that describes evolution of the energy associated with the anisotropic flows led predominantly by the @xmath54 mode .",
    "notably , this mode is generated explicitly by the nonlinear interactions .",
    "it is clear from this figure that growth rate of the generation of the anisotropic ( dominated by the @xmath54 mode ) flow is directly proportional to the magnitude of the initial fluctuations .",
    "thus the growth rate is higher when the amplitude of the magnetic and temperature field is large , i.e. @xmath119 . the smaller initial amplitude of the fluctuations correspond to relatively weak nonlinear interactions for which the generation of the @xmath54 mode is insignificant .",
    "the nonlinear interactions do not introduce anisotropy and hence lead to nearly isotropic turbulent cascades .",
    "this is observed clearly in fig 4 ( see the curve corresponding to @xmath120 ) which is consistent with the corresponding curve in fig 3 . in fig 4 , each curve is normalized with it s own initial value to rescale all the curves on a single plot .",
    "this further enables us to make a vis a vis comparison between the three different cases shown in fig 4 .",
    "also evident from the figure 4 is the large amplitude fluctuations that lead to the higher growth rate of the anisotropic flows ( see dashed lines whose slope increases with the increasing amplitude of @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) . the increasing slope , i.e. growth , associated with the anisotropic flows in our simulations is further consistent with the increasing angle of anisotropy that is observed in fig 3 .",
    "( color online ) anisotropic inhomogeneous medv turbulent fluctuations exhibit a @xmath123 like spectrum .",
    "the spectrum corresponds to an intermittent state where turbulence coexists with anisotropic structures . ]",
    "it is noteworthy from our simulations that the stronger nonlinear interactions pile up an increasing amount of turbulent energy in the @xmath54 mode .",
    "consequently , the turbulent correlation length scales tend to decrease across the flows .",
    "hence the large amplitude simulations show decorrelated flow structures in fig 2 .",
    "this physically means that the nonlinear interactions led by the polarization and diamagnetic like terms in the presence of background gradients quench the flow ( that was observed along the @xmath16-direction in fig .",
    "1 ) to introduce reduced turbulent decorrelated structures .",
    "while there exists a disparity in the spectral transfer of energy corresponding to the @xmath106 and @xmath108 modes , the 2d volume averaged turbulent spectrum follows a @xmath123 power law , as shown in fig .",
    "this spectrum is steeper than that of the hmw turbulence @xcite .",
    "the steepness of the observed spectrum can be ascribed to the coexistence of partially anisotropic flows and turbulent fluctuations in the steady state medv mode turbulence .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the properties of the medv mode turbulence nonuniform magnetoplasma containing gradients in the electron temperature , the electron number density , and the external magnetic field .",
    "we find that the influence of the magnetic field gradient is to suppress the streamer  like structures observed in simulations without the magnetic field gradient @xcite .",
    "in addition , the steep spectra changes to spectra with a 7/3 power law in the presence of the magnetic field gradient .",
    "we also discussed the conditions for an instability through a first order baroclinic effect , which would lead to the generation of magnetic fields under conditions where the background density and temperature gradients are in the same direction .",
    "it is noteworthy that the anisotropic terms in our simulations become important when the linear terms , corresponding to the gradients in magnetic and temperature fields , compete with the nonlinear terms . in such case , efficient migration of energy takes place between the gradients and turbulent modes that primarily lead to the nonlinear anisotropic flows .",
    "our study could have relevance for laser produced plasmas in the laboratory , spontaneously generated magnetic fields , and effects associated with self - generated magnetic fields such as transport of energy along surfaces and flux limitation of electrons , have been observed for many years .    *",
