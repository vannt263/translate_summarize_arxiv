    "recent low temperature experiments on clean materials near ferromagnetic quantum critical points ( fqcp ) have revealed a remarkable range of unusual properties , including non - fermi liquid scalings over a large phase space , unusual transport , and novel quantum ground states , particularly coexisting ferromagnetism and superconductivity in some materials .",
    "although criticality usually implies a certain universality , present experiments show considerable material dependent aspects that are not well understood , laughlin _",
    "e.g. _ the differences between uge@xmath1 and urhge saxena , aoki and zrzn@xmath1 , @xcite which both show coexisting ferromagnetism and superconductivity but very different phase diagrams , in contrast to mnsi , where very clean samples show no hint of superconductivity around the qcp , possibly because of the lack of the inversion symmetry .",
    "@xcite    moreover , by far not every magnetic material can be driven to a qcp by pressure or by other means of supressing ferromagnetism .",
    "typically , the transition becomes first order as the curie temperature , @xmath2 is depressed . if this happens too far away from the fluctuation dominated regime , nothing interesting is seen .",
    "also , more pedestrian effects are often important .",
    "for example , impurities or other defects can lead to scattering that smears out the quantum critical region .",
    "one of the fingerprints of a fqcp , maybe the most universal one , is a substantial overestimation of the tendency to magnetism in conventional density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , such as within the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "generally , approaches based on density functional theory ( dft ) are successful in accounting for material dependence in cases where sufficiently accurate approximations exist .",
    "density functional theory is in principle an exact ground state theory .",
    "it should , therefore , correctly describe the spin density of magnetic systems .",
    "this is usually the case in actual state of the art density functional calculations .",
    "however , common approximations to the exact density functional theory , such as the lda , may miss important physics and indeed fail to describe some materials .",
    "a well know example is in strongly hubbard correlated systems , where the lda treats the correlations in an orbitally averaged mean field way and often underestimates the tendency towards magnetism .",
    "overestimates of magnetic tendencies , especially in the lda , are considerably less common , the exceptions being materials near magnetic quantum critical points ( qcp ) ; here the error comes from neglect of low energy quantum spin fluctuations . in particular , the lda is parameterized based on the uniform electron gas at densities typical for atoms and solids . however , the uniform electron gas at these densities is stiff against magnetic degrees of freedom and far from magnetic qcp s .",
    "thus , although the lda is exact for the uniform electron gas , and therefore does include all fluctuation effects there , its description of magnetic ground states in solids and molecules is mean field like .",
    "this leads to problems such as the incorrect description of singlet states in molecules with magnetic ions as well as errors in solids when spin fluctuation effects beyond the mean field are important . in solids",
    "near a qcp , the result is an overestimate of the magnetic moments and tendency toward magnetism ( _ i.e. _ misplacement of the position of the critical point ) due to neglect of the quantum critical fluctuations .",
    "@xcite examples include three types of materials : paramagnets that are ferromagnetic in the lda , ferromagnets where the equilibrium magnetic moment is substantially overestimated in the lda , and paramagnets where the paramagnetic susceptibility is substantially overestimated .    lllllll material & zrzn@xmath1 & ni@xmath3al & sc@xmath3 in & feal & ni@xmath3ga + type & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 + calc / exp & 0.72/0.17 & 0.71/0.23 & 1.05/0.20 & 0.80 & 0.79 + ref . &",

    "at least two of these are cases where a large deviation between the lda and experimental magnetic properties were noted , followed by transport measurements that suggest a nearby ferromagnetic quantum critical point . in particular , in sr@xmath0ru@xmath6o@xmath7 , lda calculations with the experimental crystal structure found a sizeable moment , @xcite while experimentally the material was known to be a paramagnetic metal .",
    "grigera and co - workers then showed that sr@xmath0ru@xmath6o@xmath7 has a metamagnetic quantum critical point at moderate field .",
    "@xcite pd metal provides another example : the calculated lda magnetic susceptibility is nearly twice larger that the experimental one .",
    "correspondingly , nicklas @xmath8 @xmath9@xcite found a fqcp in the pd@xmath10ni@xmath11 system at @xmath12 , where the transport properties become non - fermi liquid .",
    "we emphasize that substantial overestimates of the tendency of metals towards ferromagnetism within the lda is a rare occurance , and propose that it be used as an indicator of critical fluctuations in a material .",
    "however , for this to be an effective screen , competing states , like antiferromagnetism need to be ruled out in each material .",
    "an interesting case study is liv@xmath6o@xmath13 , which is a paramagnetic metal and occurs in the cubic spinel structure .",
    "remarkably , it was discovered by kondo and co - workers that this material behaves at low temperature like a heavy fermion metal .",
    "@xcite lda calculations showed that the material is unstable against ferromagnetism with a sizeable moment . @xcite but calculations also show that the interactions are antiferromagnetic , and as a result it is more unstable against antiferromagnetism , which however is frustrated on the spinel lattice .",

    "below , we offer a derivation equivalent to that of moriya , but rendering the results in more computable form .",

    "@xcite , show that an approach based on correction of the lda using the fluctuation dissipation theorem has promise .",
    "however , the results hinge on an unknown cut - off , which serves the purpose of including fluctuations that are associated with the fqcp and are not included in the lda , from those that are included in the lda . while it is apparently possible to obtain useful results using reasonable ansatz for this cut - off",

    "the point is that the density of states is a highly non - local parameter ( note that it involves a delta function integral in energy ) , which can hardly be discerned from local information about the charge density , while the stoner parameter is a very local quantity associated with the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the difference between @xmath148 and @xmath134 then comes from the difference between @xmath150 and the density of states , @xmath151 of the reference system .",
    "one may think about several different ways for choosing @xmath152 one may be to take average @xmath153 over the width of the valence band , @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the total number of states in the band and @xmath156 is its width .",
    "one can also think about the density of states of the uniform electron gas with the same stoner parameter .",
    "there may be other , more sophisticated prescriptions .",
    "probably , the most practical approach will be found after several trial and error tests with real materials .",
    "the failure of the usual approximations to density functional theory , for example , the lda , to describe the magnetic properties of materials near ferromagnetic quantum critical points is associated with renormalization due to critical fluctuations .",
    "it is pointed out that since such fluctuations are invariably antagonistic to ferromagnetic ordering , deviations between experiment and lda calculations in which the lda is overly ferromagnetic can be a useful screen for materials near fqcps .",
    "these errors in the lda can be corrected using a phenomenalogical landau function approach with the fluctuation amplitude as a parameter . however , there is hope that this parameter can be obtained from the electronic structure via the fluctuation dissipation theorem and a suitable reference system .",
    "the key remaining challenges in our view are to define the reference system to be used , and to use calculations to determine the usefulness of this approach for real materials near a critical point .",

    "<S> we discuss the application of the density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) near a ferromagnetic quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the lda fails to describe the critical fluctuations in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a fingerprint of a materials near ferromagnetic quantum critical points : overestimation of the tendency to magnetism in the local density approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the typical , but not universal , tendency of the lda to underestimate the tendency to magnetism in strongly hubbard correlated materials . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a method for correcting the local density calculations by including critical spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on ( 1 ) landau expansion for the free energy , evaluated within the lda , ( 2 ) lowest order expansion of the rpa susceptibility in lda and ( 3 ) extraction of the amplitude of the relevant ( critical ) fluctuations by applying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to the difference between a quantum - critical system and a reference system removed from the quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate some of the aspects of this by the cases of ni@xmath0al and ni@xmath0ga , which are very similar metals on opposite sides of a ferromagnetic quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> lda calculations predict that ni@xmath0ga is the more magnetic system , but we find that due to differences in the band structure , fluctuation effects are larger in ni@xmath0ga , explaining the fact that experimentally it is the less magnetic of the two materials .    </S>",
