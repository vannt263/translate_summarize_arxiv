    "a common technique in theoretical and applied kinematics is the use of a point model for the group @xmath0 of rigid body displacements .",
    "one prominent example is the projectivised dual quaternion model of @xmath0 which exhibits particularly nice geometric and algebraic properties @xcite . in this article",
    ", we revisit some fundamental concepts related to this model , the transformation group generated by coordinate changes in the moving and the fixed frame and the kinematic images of dyads with revolute and prismatic joints .",
    "while numerous necessary conditions on these objects are well - known , we contribute sets of provably sufficient conditions .",
    "our characterisation of the transformation group generated by coordinate changes in fixed and moving frame ( ) is based on the pencil of quadrics spanned by the study quadric and null cone .",
    "these are quadrics corresponding to dual quaternions of real norm and purely dual norm , respectively .",
    "admissible transformations fix each member of this pencil and , in addition , preserve the two families of rulings on a further quadric in a subspace of dimension three .",
    "this leads to the important distinction between `` left '' and `` right '' rulings . at this point",
    "we also introduce a further invariant , the `` fiber projectivity '' , which will be crucial in our latter characterisation of dyads with prismatic joints in .",
    "the relative position of two rigid bodies can be constrained by a link or a sequence of links .",
    "fixing one of the two bodies , the collection of all possible poses ( position and orientation ) of the other is called a _ constrained variety .",
    "_ these are important objects in the study of open and closed kinematic chains , in linkage synthesis or analysis and other fields . in",
    ", we characterise constraint varieties generated by dyads of two revolute joints ( `` rr dyads '' ) as regular ruled quadrics in the study quadric that contain four complex rulings of the null cone .    in",
    "we extend this result to dyads containing one prismatic and one revolute joint ( `` rp dyads '' and `` pr dyads '' ) .",
    "it is tempting to view them as limiting cases of rr dyads where one joint axis becomes `` infinite '' ( lies in the plane at infinity ) .",
    "indeed , their kinematic image is a regular ruled quadric in the study quadric that intersects the null cone in two complex lines and a real transversal line . nonetheless , this viewpoint is not complete because of the possibility of commuting r and p joints ( `` cylindrical joints '' ) .",
    "a closer investigation leads us to a more refined concept involving the fiber projectivity which allows to distinguish between the rp , the pr , and the cylindrical case .",
    "we conclude this paper with an application of our results to a recently presented non - injective extension of the classical kinematic map @xcite . here",
    ", commuting rp dyads appear naturally as kinematic images of straight lines .",
    "we use this to prove that the extended kinematic image of a straight line is , in general , a vertical darboux motion .",
