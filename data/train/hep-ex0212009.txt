    "the decay @xmath0 is an anticipated lepton - number violating process in supersymmetric models@xcite , left - right supersymmetric models@xcite and in supersymmetric string unified models@xcite . for some ranges of model parameters , decay rates as high several parts per million are expected for this decay@xcite , even in light of the current experimental limit on the related @xmath6 decay@xcite .",
    "assuming that neutrinos have mass , the standard model branching ratio is expected at the o(@xmath7 ) level .",
    "the current best published limit is b(@xmath0 ) @xmath8 from the cleo experiment using 12.6 million @xmath9 pairs@xcite .",
    "this analysis uses @xmath2 @xmath10 events from the 1999 - 2001 data set to give a preliminary result of b(@xmath11 ) .",
    "the general signature of the @xmath0 signal is the presence of an isolated @xmath12 and @xmath13 which have an invariant mass consistent with that of the @xmath9(1.777 gev ) and with an energy in the centre - of - mass system ( cms ) consistent with the beam energy in the cms ( 5.29 gev ) and the rest of the particles in the event having properties that are consistent with being produced in a generic 1-prong @xmath9 decay .",
    "the analysis is performed using a blinded mass - energy region in the data which corresponds to a 3@xmath14 error ellipse centred on the expected peak of the distribution .",
    "a cut - based approach is used , in which the background in the signal - box is estimated from extrapolations using side - band data and verified with the monte carlo simulation . the determination of selection criteria in this analysis was based on monte carlo simulation of background and signal as well as on data in side - band regions further away from the signal - box .",
    "background sources arising from non-@xmath10 sources , the most problematic of which are radiative @xmath15 pair events , are reduced to small levels .",
    "this leaves the generic 1-prong @xmath9 decays as the major source of background .",
    "the dominant , and irreducible , background is from radiative muonic decays of the @xmath9 in which the two neutrinos have very little energy .",
    "the monte carlo simulation uses a complete description of the detector response employing the geant4@xcite software .",
    "the most important simulation samples are those involving @xmath16 decays . these include 27.6 million generic @xmath10 events , which use koralb employing the tauola decay package@xcite , and the @xmath0 signal incorporated into tauola .",
    "forty thousand signal events were generated which form the bulk of the signal monte carlo used for the analysis .",
    "a second signal sample with differing beam background contributions was produced in order to provide a cross check on the sensitivity of the selection to different background conditions .",
    "additionally , simulated @xmath15 events , which uses the afkqed generator@xcite , provide tools for @xmath12 particle identification and some guidance on @xmath17 event suppression .",
    "other potential backgrounds include @xmath18 and @xmath19 which were studied using the corresponding generic simulated event samples . as the selection is restricted to events in which both @xmath9 s decay via 1-prong modes , the @xmath19 background is completely negligible as indicated by the simulated events .",
    "the @xmath20 and light - quark background contributions are also found to be very small , with no events in the simulation surviving from these two sources after all cuts have been applied , and consequently have not been included further in the data - monte carlo comparisons .",
    "the two - photon processes are negligible backgrounds for events in which the beam energy is detected in a cms hemisphere .",
    "( b ) @xmath21 and ( c ) @xmath21 vs @xmath22 for the monte carlo simulation of the @xmath0 signal . ]    because there is no missing energy in the @xmath0 signal , the mass of the measured decay products is the @xmath9 mass and the energy is the full energy of the @xmath9 . ignoring the effects of initial - state radiation , the energy of the final state particles is equal to the full energy of the beam in the cms .",
    "this situation lends itself very well to the use of a mass of the @xmath23 system calculated from the kinematic fit employing the beam energy constraint on the energy of the system as used by argus , and denoted as @xmath21 .",
    "the energy variable used is the difference between the measured @xmath23 energy and the beam energy , denoted by the symbol @xmath22 .",
    "the distributions of these variables are shown in figure  [ fig5](a)-(c ) .",
    "the resolutions of the core of these distributions , which represent those events with well reconstructed photons and tracks , are @xmath24 = 88 mev and @xmath25 = 19 mev .",
    "however , as is evident by the diagonal band of events present in figure  [ fig5](c ) , when initial state radiation shifts the true energy of the @xmath9 from the beam energy , there a negative correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath21 and a substantial loss of resolution . the low - energy tail of the @xmath22 distribution for well reconstructed @xmath21 , evident in figure  [ fig5](c ) , is populated by events with a photon reconstructed with the correct direction , but with significant energy loss .",
    "vs @xmath22 plane shown schematically overlaying the distribution of the simulated signal .",
    "the signal region is the assymetric ellipse within the elliptical blinded region . ]",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the various regions in the @xmath21 vs @xmath22 plane used for determining the selection criteria , measuring the background , and defining the signal and blinded regions .",
    "a ` grand side - band ' is defined as the region within the @xmath26 gev and @xmath27 gev bounds .",
    "it is used for evaluating the reliability of the estimation of the signal efficiency and this is also shown on the figure .",
    "the signal - box is an elliptical region centred on the peak of the two - dimensional distribution as determined by the monte carlo . for the positive side of @xmath22 ,",
    "the ellipse has a 3@xmath14 half - axis for both the @xmath22 and @xmath21 axes whereas for the negative side of @xmath22 the ellipse has a 2@xmath14 half - axis in @xmath22 and a 3@xmath14 half - axis for @xmath21 .",
    "the resolutions used in defining the signal - box are those of the core gaussians obtained from the signal monte carlo .",
    "this asymmetric shape provides an optimal signal - box given the resolution in @xmath22 and the presence of increasing background in the negative @xmath22 region that is not present for positive @xmath22 .",
    "events that are ultimately selected and included in a study of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 variables must first pass a number of selection criteria .",
    "these requirements are designed primarily to reduce the number of bhabha and @xmath15 events .",
    "the requirements of the standard background filter which the signal events pass :    * 2 charged tracks * zero net charge * @xmath28 gev * @xmath29 gev * @xmath30 or @xmath31 * @xmath32 * @xmath33 * charged track separation @xmath34 in the cms * at least one @xmath13 * fiducial region : @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the track momentum ; @xmath37 is the calorimeter energy associated with the track ; @xmath38 is the total transverse momentum of charged tracks in the cms ; and subscript cm indicates when the quantity is in the cms .",
    "these requirements have an efficiency of @xmath39 .",
    "these efficiency losses arise largely from the fiducial acceptance of the detector , but also from the branching ratio to 1-prong modes . at this stage of the analysis ,",
    "@xmath40 events are selected in the data .",
    "monte carlo studies indicate that 83% of the signal events pass these requirements for events which would have otherwise been selected .",
    "subsequent selections employ requirements to remove the non-@xmath9 background sources and the @xmath41 and @xmath42 events in particular .",
    "cuts include a specific requirement on the observed cms energy , @xmath43 , to exclude the aforementioned background sources in general and a @xmath12 veto for reduction of di - muon backgrounds in particular .",
    "the event is tagged via an electron or @xmath44 on the opposing side .",
    "the missing mass on the tag side is restricted to reduce backgrounds from lost or difficlt to reconstruct tracks . to be consistent with a decay through an intermediate @xmath9",
    ", the tag track is required to have less than 80% of the cms beam energy . in general",
    ", this will not be the case for the non-@xmath9 backgrounds .    on the signal side",
    ", we impose the requirement of an identified @xmath12 and an associated @xmath13 with energy in excess of 400 mev .",
    "these cuts are applied in addition to the obvious @xmath21 and @xmath22 cuts for the final selection .",
    "the cut progression shows that once the non-@xmath9 background is removed by requiring an electron - vs-@xmath23 or @xmath45-vs-@xmath23 events , the @xmath9 monte carlo simulation tracks the data reasonably well .",
    "we present in figures  [ fig14 ] and  [ fig12 ] a sample of the distributions of variables employed in the analysis after all other requirements , apart from that using the one shown , have been applied .",
    "the data distributions are represented by points and the @xmath9 monte carlo simulation by histograms in these figures .",
    "the normalizations of the monte carlo distributions is fixed by the luminosity .",
    "after all other requirements , apart from the final @xmath21-@xmath22 , have been applied .",

    ", width=264,height=264 ]    these distributions are well described by the @xmath10 simulation in both shape and overall normalization .",
    "there are 604 events in the data in these distributions and the ratio of data to the monte carlo expectation is @xmath46 .",
    "the first error is statistical and the second is the systematic error associated with normalization of the monte carlo events .",
    "this normalization uncertainty is a component of the systematic error associated with the efficiency of selecting the signal .",
    "this includes uncertainties in integrated luminosity , cross - section , radiation treatment in the generator and branching ratio uncertainties .    because the signal has a relatively stiff momentum spectrum , muon particle identification ( @xmath12-pid ) efficiency using a sample of radiative @xmath12 pair events ( @xmath47 ) from the same data",
    "set used for the rest of the analysis was exploited to study the @xmath12-pid efficiency .",
    "contamination from sources other than the @xmath12 pair , such as @xmath10 events , are negligible in this sample .",
    "the ratio of the efficiencies as a function of lab momentum of the data to that of the @xmath48 simulation was studied and a correction based upon the control sample was extracted .",
    "similarly obtained is the correction for the @xmath10 events in the monte carlo sample and the signal monte carlo .",
    "this method for applying the correction is particularly appropriate here as the polar - angle , azimuthal and momentum distributions and their correlations are very similar between the @xmath12 pair control sample and the signal and background . from these studies , an additional correction factor of 0.80 to 0.85",
    "is applied to the efficiency as predicted by the monte carlo .",
    "there are two broad categories of background that require suppression : the background arising from non-@xmath10 sources , the most significant being @xmath49 , and those coming from standard @xmath9 decays . in the latter category , the @xmath50 form an irreducible background .",
    "the @xmath9 backgrounds are supressed by requiring the signal @xmath13 to be energetic , @xmath51 , and by imposing tight requirements on the @xmath12-pid of the track .",
    "the non-@xmath9 background is reduced by requiring there to be a non-@xmath12 tag on the non - signal hemi - sphere and by removing events with measured momentum and calorimeter energy characteristic of events and hemispheres with little or no undetected energy .",
    "these events are particularly problematic as they naturally possess a value of @xmath22 that overlaps the signal .",
    "after all the selection criteria have been applied , before applying the signal - box cut , there remain background sources in the grand side - band region that , from the monte carlo simulation , consist of @xmath52 ( 85.9% ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( 10.6% ) and @xmath55 ( 3.5% ) .",
    "the non-@xmath9 background is expected to be very small in the final sample .",
    "the background is estimated by fitting the side - bands in @xmath21 on a sample of data selected to have @xmath56 . as seen in figure  [ fig83 ] ,",
    "the distribution of the background is reasonably uniform in the region of the final selection , which enables one to use a simple linear interpolation to estimate the density of background one expects in the signal - box region .",
    "a geometrical correction is applied to estimate the background contained in the elliptical signal - box .",
    "a low statistics check of the method is made by applying it to the @xmath10 monte carlo sample . in this case , the luminosity scaled number of events predicted from the side - bands is @xmath57 events , in good agreement with the @xmath58 events observed .",
    "this estimate of @xmath58 is the only background estimate based purely on counting monte carlo events .",
    "the data side - band measurements yield estimates of @xmath4 events .",
    "using the @xmath10 monte carlo , the above selections yield an absolute efficiency for the signal of @xmath59 .",
    "after the final selection of requiring the events fall within the @xmath21 - @xmath22 signal - box , the efficiency is @xmath3 .",
    "this efficency has a number of systematic uncertainties associated with it including those arising from :    1 .   the trigger efficiency 2 .   the tracking reconstruction efficiency 3 .   the neutral cluster reconstruction efficiency 4 .   the background filter and skim selection efficiency 5 .",

    "the effects of systematic items ( 1)-(7 ) are incorporated into the ratio of observed to expected events : @xmath46 .",
    "this yields an estimate of 7.3% on the systematic error associated with items ( 1)-(7 ) .    a global estimate of tracking and calorimetry errors is provided by shifting the signal - box position and by modifying the size of the box according to the uncertainties in the resolution .",
