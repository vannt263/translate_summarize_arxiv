    "we first consider two initially maximally entangled single - mode cavities ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "[ such a system can be prepared by sending a single circular rydberg atom in its exited state through two identical and initially empty high - q microwave cavities@xcite . ] a two - level rydberg atom @xmath6 prepared in the ground state @xmath7 passes through the cavity @xmath4 .",
    "the resonant interaction between the two - level atom and cavity mode frequency takes place with the rabi angle @xmath1 . in presence of the cavity dissipation",
    "the dynamics of the flight of the atom is governed by the evolution equation @xmath8 at temperature @xmath9 @xmath10 the average thermal photon number is zero .",
    "since we are working with a two - level rydberg atom , its lifetime is much larger compared to the atom - cavity interaction time and hence we can neglect the atomic dissipation .",
    "the first term on the r.h.s . of eq.([b10 ] ) evolves under the usual jaynes - cummings interaction , and the second term is given by @xmath11 where @xmath0 is the cavity leakage constant .",
    "we consider the approximation of a two - level cavity , i.e. , the probability of getting a two or more than two  photon number state of the cavities is zero . under",
    "the secular approximation@xcite the time - evolved density matrix of the reduced state of the first cavity and the atom ( @xmath12 ) is given by @xmath13 in the basis @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the @xmath20-photon and the @xmath21-photon number basis states of the cavities , respectively , and @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the cavity leakage constants of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we quantify the entanglement using the measure _ concurrence _ , which for a general state @xmath26 is defined as@xcite @xmath27 , where the @xmath28 are the eigenvalues of @xmath29 in descending order .",
    "we compute the concurrence for @xmath30 , which is given by @xmath31 if we take @xmath32 , one gets @xmath33 for small @xmath0 , we can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the value of the concurrence in the case of ideal cavities with no dissipation . it follows from eq.([b14 ] ) that for large @xmath0 one gets @xmath36 , as expected .",
    "this feature of dissipation assisted increase of entanglement is observed for a range of values of @xmath0 , and the maximum of concurrence is obtained for the value of @xmath37/(2gt)$ ] at fixed @xmath1 . as an aside , it is interesting to note that the entanglement between the two cavities @xmath4 and @xmath5 falls off with increasing @xmath0 , thus providing a manifestation of the monogamous nature of entanglement between the pairs @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "a monogamy inequality@xcite for this situation has been verified@xcite .",
    "the increase of entanglement with @xmath0 as seen in eq.([b15 ] ) follows from the collective nature of the dynamics of the two cavities , as is apparent from the structure of the elements of the atom - cavity state given in eqs.([b131 ] ) where the @xmath22 s are the sums of two terms involving @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "this motivates us to look for similar collective effects in other simple tripartite systems such as the one involving the interaction of a single cavity with two successive atoms , considered below .",
    "before considering the real micromaser , we now investigate a micromaser - type system where two two - level atoms , the first prepared in the excited state @xmath40 , and the second prepared in the ground state @xmath41 , are sent into a vacuum cavity one after the other , i.e. , there is no spatial overlap between the two atoms .",
    "our purpose here is to demonstrate analytically the increase of two - atom entanglement in this model with the increase of cavity damping rate .",
    "we compute the time - evolved density state for the tripartite system of the two atoms and the cavity under the same secular approximation , and the approximation of a two level ( zero or one photon ) cavity .",
    "the reduced density state of the pair of atoms @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 in the basis of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 states , and where @xmath48 are given by @xmath49    the concurrence for the joint two - atom state @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 for values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 such that @xmath52 , we can write @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( no dissipation ) in this case is given by @xmath55 .",
    "thus , enhancement of @xmath56 , i.e. , the increase of the atom - atom mixed - state entanglement over its value in the ideal cavity case is possible if we choose interaction time judiciously , such that @xmath57 . for fixed @xmath1 , the concurrence @xmath56 is maximised at @xmath58/(gt)$ ]",
    ". further increase of cavity damping @xmath0 , causes the two - atom entanglement to fall off .",
    "this sets the stage for us to investigate next the full micromaser dynamics .",
    "we now consider the real micromaser which has been experimentally operational@xcite .",
    "the mathematical model for the micromaser has been well studied , and is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "its essential features are outlined briefly here .",
    "the cavity is pumped to its steady state by a poissonian stream of atoms passing through it one at a time , with the time of flight through the cavity @xmath59 being the same for every atom .",
    "the dynamics of these individual flights are governed by the evolution equation with three kinds of interactions given by @xmath60 where the strength of three couplings are given by the parameters @xmath61 ( the atomic dissipation constant ) , @xmath0 ( the cavity leakage constant ) , and @xmath3 ( the atom - field interaction constant ) with the individual expressions provided in @xcite .",
    "obviously , @xmath62 describes the dynamics of the cavity when there is no atom inside it .",
    "the finite temperature of the cavity is represented by the average thermal photons @xmath63 , obtained from b - e statistics .",
    "the density matrix of the steady - state cavity field @xmath64 can be obtained by solving the above equation and tracing over the reservoir and atomic variables@xcite .",
    "the photon distribution function is then given by @xmath65 we display the steady state photon statistics for the micromaser for experimentally realizable values@xcite of the parameters @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes the number of atoms passing through the caviy per second ) , @xmath63 and @xmath1 in table  1 . the probability of getting two ( @xmath69 ) or more photons inside the cavity is negligible .",
    "the photon statistics thus provides a justification for our earlier assumption of a two - level cavity ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) used for obtaining our analytical results of entanglement enhancement through dissipation in the previous examples .",
    "however , our present analysis for the real micromaser does not employ this assumption .",
    "we compute the atomic entanglement generated between two experimental atoms that pass successively through the micromaser cavity .",
    "the tripartite joint state of the cavity and the two atoms is obtained by summing over all @xmath75 . the reduced density state of the two atoms after passing through the the cavity field is given by @xmath76 where the @xmath77 are given by @xmath78        the concurrence of the two - atom state is plotted with respect to the rabi angle @xmath1 in fig .",
    "1 choosing the cavity temperature as in the operational micromaser@xcite .",
    "we see that the entanglement between the two atoms increases as we increase the cavity dissipation parameter @xmath2 from the experimental values ( solid curves in fig .",
    "1 ) at a fixed values of the rabi angle @xmath1 . increased damping of the micromaser cavity causes the average cavity photon number @xmath79 to go down , as displayed in table  1 .",
    "the collective dynamics of the system causes the magnitude of two - atom entanglement to rise with decreasing @xmath79 .",
    "this anti - correlation of the two - atom entanglement with the cavity photon number @xmath79 has also been observed in earlier works@xcite .",
    "it is expected that further increase of @xmath2 beyond the values shown in the figure would make the concurrence to fall .",
    "however , the validity of the micromaser theory that we have used@xcite is itself limited to low dissipation values by the secular approximation@xcite .    to summarize , in this letter we have presented concrete examples of the increase of entanglement caused by the stronger interaction of a part of a compsite system with its environment .",
    "we have first considered the atom - cavity entanglement in a system comprised of two entangled cavities and a two - level atom@xcite .",
    "the derived expression for the atom - cavity concurrence clearly shows the maximization of entanglement for intermediate values of the cavity damping .",
    "a similar analytical result is also obtained for two - atom entanglement in the case of a micromaser - type system involving a single cavity and two atoms .",
    "we have further investigated a model for the real micromaser@xcite and demonstrated the increase of atomic entanglement with cavity damping for fixed atom - cavity interaction times for experimentally operational values of the micromaser parameters . with further development ,",
    "it may be possible to utlize this effect of environment assisted entanglement enhancement in information processing involving multipartite systems where the interactions times may not be easily controllable . in conclusion , we highlight that atom - cavity systems provide much scope for the quantitative tests of several manifestations of environment induced entanglement@xcite in experimentally realizable situations .",
