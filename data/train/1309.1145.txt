    "both bau and dm are strong motivations for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , as neither significant baryon number ( b ) violation nor appropriate non - luminous gravitationally interacting fields exist within the sm .",
    "the most common models that explain dm provide a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) to account for the observed density  @xcite .",
    "a typical wimp , with weak scale mass and couplings , will depart from equilibrium in the early universe when self - annihilation freezes out , yielding roughly the correct relic dm density .",
    "it is natural to wonder if the annihilation process which determines the dark matter density can also yield a baryon asymmetry .",
    "many models have been proposed to explain bau  @xcite , but generally , in order for a process to produce the observed baryon asymmetry , the sakharov conditions  @xcite for baryogenesis must be satisfied .",
    "the sakharov conditions require :    * a violation of baryon number ( or lepton number ( l ) , if the asymmetry is generated above the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) ) , * a violation of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , * a departure from thermal equilibrium .    although decaying dark matter with a weak scale mass has been suggested as a model for baryogenesis @xcite , a wimp framework which satisfies the first two conditions would automatically accommodate the third .",
    "this mechanism of  wimpy baryogenesis \" was recently proposed by cui , randall and shuve @xcite . in a typical wimpy model , dark matter ,",
    "denoted @xmath2 with @xmath3 , annihilates to an additional new weak scale field , denoted @xmath4 , and a quark ( or lepton ) via @xmath0-violating interactions .",
    "the @xmath0-violating phase arises from interference between tree - level and loop diagrams .",
    "@xmath4 then subsequently decays into light particles , including particles which are uncharged under standard model gauge symmetries , thus sequestering any negative baryon ( or lepton ) asymmetry . between",
    "the time @xmath2 begins to depart from equilibrium , @xmath5 , and when @xmath2 freezes out with the correct relic density , the correct baryon asymmetry can also be produced .",
    "if dm annihilates to leptons , then any lepton asymmetry is transferred to baryons through electroweak sphalerons at temperatures above the ewpt .",
    "while in ref .",
    "@xcite , uv - complete models mediated by weak scale pseudoscalars are presented , generalization to an effective field theory ( eft ) was more recently shown by bernal , josse - michaux and ubaldi  @xcite .",
    "the eft wimpy model achieves results similar to a uv - complete model , with dm annihilating to @xmath4 and quarks through all possible dimension six operators .",
    "this allows one to focus on aspects of the generation of a baryon asymmetry which can arise from many different uv completions .",
    "subsequent work  @xcite provided a general analysis of how washout processes can erase an asymmetry .",
    "the key constraint on wimpy baryogenesis models , either constructed in a uv - complete or eft formalism , is that the couplings which must be added to generate needed one - loop contributions also introduce dangerous tree - level washout processes .",
    "these processes are ",
    "dangerous \" because they are not boltzmann - suppressed , even when some of the external particles are heavy . as a result",
    ", features of the model must be chosen to render these processes less dangerous .",
    "this work focused on the particular case where @xmath6 , and found a class of models in which @xmath4 may decay entirely into standard model particles , while still generating the required baryon asymmetry .",
    "for these processes , the asymmetry is largely generated after the washout processes are frozen out .    in this work ,",
    "we consider wimpy leptogenesis would have to be charged under @xmath7 .",
    "models of this form are constrained by direct searches for color - charged particles at colliders  @xcite , and standard model quarks produced by the decay of @xmath4 would affect the baryon asymmetry .",
    "though such models are certainly possible , we will for simplicity focus on the case where dark matter annihilation directly produces a lepton asymmetry , along with a particle @xmath4 whose decay does not affect the baryon or lepton asymmetry . ]",
    "@xcite , in which dark matter annihilation directly produces a lepton asymmetry which is converted into a baryon asymmetry by electroweak sphalerons .",
    "we focus on an effective field theory approach , in which dark matter annihilation can be parametrized in terms of a set of effective operators .",
    "in contrast to previous work , here we will obtain a @xmath0-violating phase at tree - level from the interference between dimension six operators .",
    "we will find that one - loop corrections effects are necessary for generating an asymmetry , but they can be sequestered in absorptive terms in the final state interactions of @xmath4 . because these terms do not directly affect either the standard model or dark sector , we will be able to relax some of the parameter space constraints typically found in wimpy baryogenesis models .",
    "we will find that some dangerous tree - level washout processes , which are often introduced by the interactions needed to obtain @xmath0-violation , are not present in the models we consider .",
    "moreover , the ratio of @xmath0-violating to @xmath0-conserving interactions is not controlled by the scale of new physics . as a result",
    ", one can generate the correct baryon asymmetry for @xmath8 dark matter even if the scale of new physics is as large as @xmath9 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the reason why a one - loop contribution is necessary , and describe our class of models . in section iii",
    "we describe the solution of the boltzmann equations which govern the dark matter and lepton densities . in section iv",
    ", we present our results and compare to those of other models of wimpy baryogenesis . we conclude with a discussion of our results in section v.",
    "we will consider models with a single dark matter candidate @xmath2 ( stabilized by a @xmath10 symmetry ) whose annihilation can be modeled with a set of effective four - point operators .",
    "symmetry , since one of the final state particles is also charged under this stabilizing symmetry .",
    "that is not the case here , unless the effective operator respects @xmath11 . in that case",
    ", we would also need a @xmath12 symmetry under which @xmath2 and @xmath4 are charged , in order to protect @xmath4 from standard model decays which could wash out the asymmetry . ]",
    "each effective operator can be written as a product of an initial state dark matter bilinear and a final state bilinear .",
    "this final state bilinear couples a standard model lepton ( @xmath13 ) and an exotic fermion ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "in order for the annihilation process to contribute to a lepton asymmetry , the effective operators must violate @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "we can already constrain the set of effective operators which are relevant . for dark matter annihilation to contribute to a baryon asymmetry",
    ", there must be interference between two matrix element terms with different phases ( otherwise , any @xmath0-violating phase would cancel in the squared matrix element ) . at lowest dimension",
    ", there are only two sets of fermionic dark matter bilinears which can interfere in an annihilation process  @xcite :    * @xmath14 and @xmath15 can both annihilate an @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( @xmath0-odd ) initial state .",
    "* @xmath19 and @xmath20 can both annihilate an @xmath21 , @xmath17 , @xmath22 ( @xmath0-even ) initial state .    if the dark matter is spin-0 , then there are no dimension 2 or dimension 3 bilinears which can interfere .",
    "moreover , if dark matter is a majorana fermion , the second set of bilinears above vanish .",
    "we will thus consider two sets of effective operators : _",
    "s=0 & = & _ 1 2m_*^2 ( |x ^5 x ) ( |h p_l l ) + _ 1^ * 2m_*^2 ( |x ^5 x ) ( |l p_r h ) + & & + _ 2 2m_*^2 ( |x _ ^5 x ) ( |h ^p_l l ) + _ 2^ * 2m_*^2 ( |x _ ^5 x ) ( |l ^p_l h ) + o_s=1 & = & _ 3 m_*^2 ( |x ^x ) ( |h _ p_l",
    "l ) + _ 3^ * m_*^2 ( |x ^x ) ( |l _ p_l h ) + & & + _ 4 m_*^2 ( |x ^ x ) ( |h _ p_l l ) + _ 4^ * m_*^2 ( |x ^ x ) ( |l _ p_r h ) [ eq : operator ] where @xmath13 is a standard model lepton and @xmath4 is an exotic field with no lepton number .",
    "note that these operators can not interfere with each other , as they annihilate initial states with different spin and/or orbital angular momentum .",
    "we may thus treat each operator separately .",
    "both operators are maximally @xmath1-violating .",
    "since both operators will yield similar results , we focus on the case of @xmath23",
    ".    the quantum numbers of @xmath4 depend on whether dark matter annihilates to a charged or neutral lepton ( we have assumed for simplicity that dark matter annihilates to a left - handed lepton ; similar results can be obtained if dark matter annihilates to a charged right - handed lepton ) .",
    "the quantum numbers of the new fields for all cases are summarized in table  [ tab : particles ] .",
    "we assume our effective operators do not respect @xmath11 and @xmath24 , in order to ensure that lepton number is not washed out by electroweak scale interactions between @xmath4 and standard model particles . under which @xmath4 is charged . ] thus , our effective operator couplings must scale with the vev of the higgs field .",
    ".particle content [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is interesting to note that the @xmath0-violating part of the process @xmath25 begins to drive the asymmetry near @xmath26 , i.e.  as soon as the dark matter becomes non - relativistic .",
    "this may seem counterintuitive , since the sakharov conditions require a departure from thermal equilibrium and dark matter freeze out occurs much later , near @xmath27 .",
    "the point is that the dark matter density departs slightly from the equilibrium density as soon as dark matter becomes non - relativistic . at freeze - out",
    ", dark matter stops tracking the equilibrium density and the departure from equilibrium becomes large .",
    "one can see this simply by considering the boltzmann equation ( eq .  [ eq : boltzmanndm ] ) ; if the dark matter density is equal to the equilibrium density , then @xmath28 .",
    "this relation is satisfied if dark matter is relativistic ( @xmath29 ) , but is violated when dark matter is non - relativistic ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "a slight departure from equilibrium is necessary to provide the excess annihilation which drives @xmath31 to smaller values .",
    "although the departure from equilibrium is very small before freeze out , the dark matter density at @xmath26 is so much larger than at @xmath32 that the driving contribution to the lepton asymmetry is largest at small @xmath33 .",
    "however , at small @xmath33 the washout processes are also at their strongest and the net asymmetry is quite small .",
    "a large asymmetry begins to be generated as soon as the washout processes begin to freeze out , which for these models typically happens near @xmath34 , as in  @xcite .",
    "there are a few features which distinguish our results from those of other wimpy baryogenesis models .",
    "first of all , in previous works , the interactions necessary to produce the needed one - loop diagrams also introduce tree - level washout diagrams in which @xmath2 does not appear as an initial or final state .",
    "these washout processes are essentially processes of the form @xmath35 , and can be significant even when @xmath36 . on the other hand , in the class of models we consider ,",
    "all washout diagrams have @xmath2 as a final state .",
    "note also that @xmath37 , and is independent of the mediator scale @xmath38 .",
    "this is in contrast with other wimpy baryogenesis models , where one typically finds @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "this difference has some interesting effects .",
    "if we assume that @xmath2 constitutes all of the dark matter , then the total cross section for the annihilation process @xmath40 is bounded by @xmath41 . in order to generate a large enough asymmetry",
    ", @xmath42 can not be too small ; it appears that one would need @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 and @xmath45 , this would require that @xmath46 .",
    "by contrast , in our low - mass benchmark model , the new physics scale @xmath47 can be much larger , since @xmath42 is independent of the scale of the new physics in the effective operator . as a result",
    ", the total @xmath40 cross section can be much smaller than the @xmath48 .    in all of the models we have considered ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath6 .",
    "it is difficult to find a successful model if one instead chooses @xmath49 .",
    "the reason is because we have assumed the narrow - width approximation , in which @xmath4 acts as a resonance , and thus require @xmath50 .",
    "in such a model , since we would also still require @xmath51 , a light @xmath4 field would imply a small cross section asymmetry .",
    "we have considered a model of wimpy leptogenesis , in which a lepton asymmetry is generated by dark matter annihilation processes which violate @xmath1 , @xmath0 and lepton number .",
    "we have studied in detail the necessity for one - loop contributions to the annihilation process . in particular , we have found the @xmath0-violating terms may all arise at tree - level , while one - loop diagrams may arise only in absorptive final state interactions in a sterile sector .",
    "the advantage of this type of model is that it allows one to sequester the one - loop suppression from the generation of a @xmath0-violating phase . in wimpy baryogenesis models where this sequestration does not occur ,",
    "the introduction of one - loop terms implies the presence of new tree - level process which are not boltzmann suppressed and which can washout the baryon asymmetry . in the class of models we have considered",
    ", these dangerous washout processes do not occur .",
    "moreover , because the ratio of @xmath0-violating to @xmath0-conserving terms in the cross section is independent of the scale of new physics , we find that wimpy models with @xmath52 can work with a new physics scale @xmath38 as large as @xmath9 , and where the annihilation cross sections relevant for wimpy leptogenesis are much smaller than @xmath53 .",
    "it is interesting to consider prospects for probing these dark matter interactions experimentally .",
    "indirect detection may be feasible for wimpy leptogenesis models in general , but given our specific @xmath0-violating processes , primary dark matter annihilation channels would likely dominate over any measurable imprint our subdominant channel would leave on the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "better prospects may lie with high energy / luminosity @xmath54 colliders , which may be able to probe lepton number- or lepton flavor - violating processes to which these operators could contribute .    for simplicity",
    ", we have focused on the approximation where , despite the presence of final state absorptive interactions , the sterile particle @xmath4 can be treated as a narrow resonance produced on - shell . but this assumption is not required , and if the narrow - width approximation does not hold , then all of the asymmetry - generating and washout processes would have to be fully treated as @xmath55 processes . in this case , one would expect that one - loop suppression required for @xmath0-violating annihilation rates would be significantly reduced .",
    "it would be interesting to study this scenario concretely .",
