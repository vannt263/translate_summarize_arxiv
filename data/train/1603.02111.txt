    "we begin with one of the most fundamental structures of two - dimensional ( 2d ) nonmagnetic cylindrical resonator as is shown in figure  [ fig1](a ) : the core layer ( of radius @xmath0 ) is isotropic and the refractive index is @xmath7 ; the cladding layer ( of radius @xmath3 ) is radially anisotropic on the @xmath8 plane with radial index of @xmath1 and transverse ( along the azimuthal direction ) index of @xmath2 ; the anisotropy parameter is defined as @xmath4 .",
    "the resonant modes of 2d cylindrical resonators can be classified into two sets : ( i ) the transverse - magnetic ( tm ) modes with no magnetic field in the @xmath9 direction of propagation , and ( ii ) the transverse - electric ( te ) modes with no electric fields along the @xmath9 direction  @xcite .",
    "since the te resonances _ are not affected by the radial anisotropy _ of the shell layer , here we study only the tm resonances with electric fields in the @xmath8 plane . as a result",
    ", the incident plane wave is fixed to be polarized along the @xmath5 direction ( in terms of the electric field ) . according to the proposed principle of rtir  @xcite",
    ", the radial anisotropy of the cladding layer can reduce the skin depth of the evanescent waves , as is shown schematically in figure  [ fig1](b ) and ( c ) : figure  [ fig1](b ) shows the conventional tir , where an evanescent wave ( dashed curve ) resides within the lower index media , and it decays exponentially away from the boundary ; figure  [ fig1](c ) shows the rtir geometry , where the evanescent waves decays faster , which is induced by the anisotropic layer employed .    ) and isotropic cylindrical resonator ( @xmath10 and @xmath11  nm ) .",
    "both the total scattering efficiency spectrum ( black curve ) and those contributions from ed ( red curve ) , md ( green curve ) and eq ( blue curve ) are shown .",
    "two points d ( @xmath12  nm ) and q ( @xmath13  nm ) , which corresponds to the resonant positions of ed and eq respectively , are marked in ( a ) and the corresponding near fields ( partial electric field intensity : @xmath14 ) are shown in ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "( d ) the refractive index dependence of the q - factors for the ed and eq supported .",
    "the curves corresponds to the q - factors obtained through eq.([quality ] ) while circles correspond to q - factors calculated based on fwhm of the scattering spectra.,width=453 ]    as a first step , we study the scattering properties of the structure shown in figure  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "this problem can be solved analytically  @xcite , and the scattering efficiency ( scattering cross - section divided by the geometrical cross - section of the structure ) can be expressed as :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the angular wave number in the background material ( vacuum in our work ) ; @xmath17 is the radius of the outmost layer ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are the scattering coefficients , which depend on the anisotropy parameter ( see the methods section for more details ) . to be more specific , @xmath18 corresponds to the magnetic dipole ( md ) , which has all the electric fields along the transverse direction on the @xmath8 plane  @xcite . as the result ,",
    "the md resonance is only dependent on the transverse ( azimuthal ) refractive index of the cylindrical resonator , and consequently it is not affected by the radial anisotropy . while @xmath19 ( @xmath21 ) corresponds to the electric resonance of the m@xmath22 order [ _ e.g. _ , @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to the electric dipole ( ed ) and electric quadrupole ( eq ) , respectively ] . in figure  [ fig2](a )",
    "we show the scattering efficiency spectra for a homogenous and isotropic cylinder ( radius @xmath11  nm and refractive index @xmath25 ) in terms of the total scattering together with the contributions from the first three dominant resonances : md ( green curve ) , ed and eq . as md is not affected by the radial anisotropy , throughout this work we focus only on the ed and eq resonances which are both anisotropy sensitive .",
    "the indicated points d and q in figure  [ fig2](a ) correspond to the resonant positions of ed and eq respectively : @xmath12  nm and @xmath13  nm .",
    "the corresponding near - field distributions @xmath14 at those two points are shown in figure  [ fig2](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "we show here only the partial fields of the ed and eq resonances ( fields associated with other multipoles are neglected ) , which as a result exhibit typical pure ed and eq characteristics respectively .",
    "then , we study the q - factors of the ed and eq resonances of the homogeneous cylindrical nanowire .",
    "if we use @xmath26 to denote the complex resonant angular - frequency of the m@xmath22 order resonance , which corresponds to the singular point of the scattering matrix of the resonator , then the corresponding q - factor can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath27 it is worth noticing that for a homogenous cylindrical resonator , the scattering matrix is dependent only on the normalized radius @xmath28 and refractive index @xmath29 .",
    "that is to say , for fixed mode order @xmath30 , @xmath31 is proportional to the resonator radius . as a result , according to eq.([quality ] ) , @xmath32 is @xmath17-independent and depends only on the refractive index @xmath29 . the dependence of the q - factors of ed and eq on refractive index @xmath29 is shown in figure  [ fig2](d ) . as is expected , with increasing @xmath29 the q - factors of both ed and eq increases monotonically , since larger momentum mismatch between the resonator and the background leads to stronger energy confinement capability  @xcite .",
    "we note that besides the definition shown in eq.([quality ] ) [ the results have been shown by curves in figure  [ fig2](d ) ] , q - factors can be also obtained via calculating the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the scattering spectrum  @xcite : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the central resonant scattering frequency [ such as the points indicated in figure  [ fig2](a ) ] ; and @xmath35 is width of the scattering spectrum curve measured between the points where the magnitudes are half of the maximum amplitude at the central resonant position .",
    "the calculated results through scattering spectrum are shown also in figure  [ fig2](d ) by circles and it is obvious they agree well with those obtained through eq.([quality ] ) . throughout this paper , we focus on the ed and eq resonances of the lowest frequency [ besides the resonant peaks shown in figure  [ fig2](a ) , there are other scattering peaks for ed and eq at higher frequencies  @xcite ] and calculate the q - factor through eq.([quality ] ) . nevertheless , it should be reminded that for ed and eq of higher frequencies and for other ways to define and/or calculate the q factors ( or non - lorentzian asymmetric line - widths of the scattering spectrum  @xcite ) , the conclusions drawn in our work are still valid .    as a next step ,",
    "we switch to the cylindrical resonator with an anisotropic cladding and demonstrate how the rtir mechanism can be employed to enhance the q - factor and energy confinement ability of the resonances .",
    "firstly we study the core - shell resonator with an isotropic core ( @xmath36  nm ) and an anisotropic cladding .",
    "for better comparison with the homogenous resonator investigated above , we set the core index as @xmath37 , cladding layer radius as @xmath38  nm and the indexes of the cladding satisfy : @xmath39 . as a result",
    ", the anisotropy parameter can be expressed as : @xmath40 .",
    "the scattering spectra of @xmath41 is shown in figure  [ fig3](a ) , where only the contributions from ed and eq are shown [ for clearer comparison , results of homogenous case with the same outmost layer radius @xmath11  nm shown already in figure  [ fig2](a ) are re - plotted here by dashed curves ] . as is expected from the rtir principle ,",
    "the anisotropic cladding improves the energy confinement and thus can enhance the q - factor for both ed and eq , which can be justified by the presence of sharper and narrower scattering curves with anisotropy materials incorporated  @xcite . to quantitatively characterize the q - factor enhancement , in figure  [ fig3](b ) we show the dependence of q - factors of both resonances on the anisotropy parameter , which further verifies the anisotropy - origin of such enhancement . in principle , higher q - factor indicates better energy confinement capability of the resonator . to confirm this directly , in figure  [ fig3](a ) ,",
    "the positions of the ed and eq resonances for both isotropic and anisotropic cases are indicated by @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44  nm , @xmath45  nm , @xmath46  nm , @xmath47  nm ) and the corresponding total electric field ( combining the contributions of all multipoles ) intensity ( @xmath14 ) are shown in figure  [ fig3](c)-(f ) .",
    "compared to the isotropic case [ figure  [ fig3](c ) and ( e ) ] , when anisotropy is introduced [ figure  [ fig3](d ) and ( f ) ] more energy of the mode is squeezed into the core - layer , indicating better energy confinement and as a result leading to more significant field enhancement [ we note that to make the field distributions clearer , different scales of the color - bars for the fields at different points are employed in figure  [ fig3](c)-(f ) ] .",
    "it worth mentioning that compared to the symmetric field distributions shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , those shown in [ fig3 ] are asymmetric as here we show the total fields contributed by all the multipoles .",
    "this is also the case for [ fig4]-[fig5 ] .    to further quantify the capability of better energy confinement and more significant field enhancement , we denote the energy stored inside the core and shell cladding as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which can be defined respectively as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to electric fields along the radial and transverse direction respectively , which can be calculated analytically  @xcite ; the total stored energy inside the resonator is @xmath53 ; and the core energy ratio is @xmath54 . in figure  [ fig3](g )",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath55 and @xmath54 on the anisotropy parameter @xmath56 for the ed resonance .",
    "as is clearly shown , with larger @xmath56 both the total stored energy and the core energy ratio would increase , which proves convincingly tighter energy confinement and larger field enhancement inside the resonator that accompany the efficient q - factor enhancement shown in figure  [ fig3](a ) .    in the discussions above",
    ", we fixed the overall resonator radius to investigate the q - factor dependence on anisotropy parameter .",
    "now we fix the anisotropy parameter @xmath57 ( with @xmath36  nm , @xmath37 and @xmath58 ) and study the relationship between q - factor and the shell cladding radius @xmath3 .",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ fig4](a ) as solid curves for both ed and eq resonances .",
    "it is clear that the q - factor does not increase monotonically with increasing cladding radius , and there is actually an optimal radius of the shell to achieve the highest q - factor for each resonance . to reveal the mechanism behind",
    ", we select three points for both ed [ @xmath59  nm , @xmath60  nm ( optimal radius for eq ) , @xmath61  nm ] and eq [ @xmath62  nm , @xmath63  nm ( optimal radius for ed ) , @xmath64  nm ] , and show the corresponding total near - field distributions ( @xmath14 ) in figure  [ fig4](b)-(g ) .",
    "it is shown that before the optimal radius , for both resonances more energy is squeezed into the core region with increasing cladding radius , which leads to both q - factor and near - field enhancement . in a sharp contrast , after the optimal radius , with increasing @xmath3 more and more energy will leak out from the core , reducing both the q - factor and the field intensity within the resonator .",
    "this is due to the fact that when the cladding layer is becoming sufficiently large , resonances can be formed within the cladding layer , with comparably negligible energy distributed within the core layer [ see figure  [ fig4](d ) and ( g ) ] .",
    "to confirm directly this process of mode distribution transformation between the core and the shell cladding , we plot the q - factor - radius relationship of a homogeneous anisotropic cylindrical resonator with @xmath65 and @xmath58 for both ed ( dashed red curve ) and eq ( dashed blue curve ) in figure  [ fig4](a ) : it is obvious that for sufficiently large @xmath3 the q - factor would converge to that of a homogeneous anisotropic cylinder [ it is worth mentioning that similar to the isotropic case studied in figure  [ fig2 ] , the q - factor of an anisotropic homogeneous resonator is also independent on the radius ] .",
    "the results presented here could be confusing at a first glance , as it is taken for granted that increasing the anisotropic layer width would not break the condition of rtir and thus would not result in reduced q - factor or near - field intensity .",
    "but one has to keep in mind that rtir ( and tir itself ) is a concept of geometric optics , and thus can not be applied in a universal way . when the cladding layer is sufficiently large , potential distributions for photons would be changed drastically  @xcite , resulting in more energy confinement within the cladding layer and undermining the features of q - factor and near - field enhancement .        .",
    "[ fig4 ]        up to now , we have demonstrated the efficient q - factor enhancement based on anisotropic materials .",
    "unfortunately , for natural materials the anisotropy parameters employed here may not be realistic .",
    "such a problem is not insurmountable considering the recent development in the field of artificial metamaterials , where other extreme refractive indices and anisotropy parameters can be achieved  @xcite . here",
    ", we employ a cladding layer consisting of multilayers of two kinds of realistic isotropic materials ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively and @xmath68 ) to substitute the homogeneous anisotropic layer , as shown in figure  [ fig5](a ) . according to the effective medium theory  @xcite",
    ", the effective indexes for the multi - layered cladding in the @xmath8 plane are :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the filling factor of the layer of index @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath71 the largest anisotropy parameter can be achieved : @xmath72 for positive @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and @xmath73 . as a proof of concept , we set @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( _ e.g. _ for germanium ) , which leads to the following parameters for @xmath71 : @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . the structure we employ",
    "is shown schematically in figure  [ fig5](a ) , where the cladding is made of alternate @xmath66 and @xmath67 layers and the width of both layer is @xmath79  nm [ which is far smaller then the effective wavelength and then the effective medium theory eq.([effective1 ] ) can be applied ] .",
    "there are five layers of each medium , which makes @xmath71 and the overall cladding layer of radius @xmath38  nm ( for direct comparisons with the previous discussions , the core is set to be isotropic with radius @xmath36  nm and of @xmath37 ) .",
    "the scattering efficiency spectra of such isotropic @xmath80-layered cylindrical resonator can be calculated analytically  @xcite and the results are shown in figure  [ fig5](b ) by solid curves for both ed and eq resonances .",
    "it is worth mentioning that here the periodicity of the cladding is not important as far as the layer width is far smaller than the wavelength when the effective medium theory can be applied .",
    "this distinguishes our design from those based on photonic bandgap structures  @xcite . to verify the effective medium theory applied for the multi - layered cladding",
    ", we also show in figure  [ fig5](b ) by circles the scattering efficiency spectra when the multi - layered cladding is replaced by a homogenous anisotropic layer [ according to eq.([effective1 ] ) ] of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath81 .",
    "it is obvious that both sets of results agree excellently well , indicating the same q - factor for both cases [ this has already been included in figure  [ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "the two indicated points @xmath82 and @xmath83 in figure  [ fig5](a ) correspond to the resonant position of ed and eq respectively : @xmath84  nm and @xmath85  nm .",
    "the corresponding total near - field distributions ( @xmath14 ) are shown in figure  [ fig5](c ) and ( e ) for the multi - layered isotropic cylindrical resonator , and in figure  [ fig5](d ) and ( f ) for the core - shell anisotropic resonator .",
    "the strong field confinement is clearly demonstrated by comparing figure  [ fig5](c - f ) with figure  [ fig3](c ) and ( e ) .",
    "although the field distributions within the cladding layer are contrastingly different ( the fields are significantly enhanced within the @xmath86 layers due to the continuity condition along the radial direction , which is similar to that shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the fields inside the core and outside the resonator are almost the same , proving further the feasibility of applying the rtir principle to obtain high - q cavity resonators .",
    "in summary , based one the recently proposed principle of light localization in anisotropic media , we have studied all - dielectric cylindrical resonators with an isotropic core and anisotropic cladding , focusing on the q - factor enhancement of the resonances supported . due to the rtir effect",
    ", we have demonstrated that more energy can be confined within the core - layer structure , which leads to simultaneous q - factor and near - field enhancement for the resonances .",
    "we have also shown that with a fixed radial anisotropy parameter of the cladding , there exist optimal cladding layer widths to achieve the highest q - factors for resonances of different orders , thus succeeding in revealing the limitation of the rtir principle . to verify the feasibility of our approach to achieve high - q resonators",
    ", we have shown that naturally inaccessible anisotropy parameters of the cladding can be realized by employing multi - layered isotropic metamaterial structures with the property of significant q - factor enhancement preserved .",
    "it is worth mentioning that though in this work we confine our study to the two lowest order of modes ( dipole and quadruple modes ) of cylindrical structures , the principle we have demonstrated is quite general .",
    "the q - factor enhancement can certainly be achieved in spherical resonators and resonators of other shapes , for other kinds of anisotropy such as magnetic anisotropy and for modes of higher orders .",
    "actually the higher the mode order is , the stronger the q - factor enhancement effect would be [ see figure  [ fig3](b ) ] . since more energy is confined within the core of the resonator by the rtir effect , it is expected that for a cluster of such resonators the near - field coupling between them can significantly be reduced  @xcite . for the proof of concept demonstration ,",
    "we have employed the multi - layered positive - index isotropic cladding with modest anisotropy parameter of @xmath87 .",
    "other more unusual anisotropy parameters , even including those complex ones , can be made available for realistic applications relying on the artificial metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "we believe that our work of employing effective anisotropic media to enhance the q - factor opens a new dimension of freedom for manipulations of various resonators , which can incubate many new resonator based fundamental research and applications in the fields of cavity - enhanced spectroscopy and sensing , cavity optomechanics , resonant quantum and nonlinear optics , lasing and imaging , _ etc_.",
    "the seminal problem of two - dimensional ( 2d ) plane wave scattering by cylindrical resonators ( single or multilayered ) consisting of isotropic materials has been studied analytically  @xcite [ _ e.g. _ , for the scattering configuration shown in [ fig5](a ) with the corresponding scattering efficiency shown in [ fig5](b ) by solid curves ] . such analytical investigations have also been extended to 2d cylindrical resonators made of radially anisotropic materials  @xcite [ _ e.g. _ , for geometries shown in [ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "it has been revealed that for both isotropic and radially - anisotropic cases , the expressions for the field expansion coefficients ( both inside and outside the resonator ) and far - field scattering properties are identical [ see eq.([q_ext ] ) ] , except that in the anisotropic case the orders of some bessel and hankel functions need to be modified by the anisotropy parameter .    to be more specific , we take for example the simplest case of a homogeneous radially anisotropic cylinder ( radius @xmath17 and anisotropy parameter @xmath88 ) in vacuum .",
    "the scattering efficiency can be expressed by eq.([q_ext ] ) where the scattering coefficients for the incident plane waves of tm polarizations can be expressed as  @xcite :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the modified function order @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the bessel and hankel functions of the first kind  @xcite and the accompanying primes indicate their differentiation with respect to the entire argument . obviously the results will be reduced to the those of isotropic case when @xmath94 .",
    "it is clear that the md mode of @xmath95 is independent of the anisotropy , which is consistent with our former argument based on field distribution .",
    "similar to eq.([method_1 ] ) , all the field expansion coefficients within the resonator can be obtained in all the layers through simply modifying the function order when the radially anisotropic materials are present . as a result the energy stored within the resonator [ see [ energy ] ] can also be calculated analytically .",
