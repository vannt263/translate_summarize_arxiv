    "the invariant variety of periodic points , or the ivpp for short@xcite@xcite@xcite , of a @xmath0 dimensional map @xmath1 , @xmath2 with @xmath3 invariants @xmath4 of period @xmath5 is a `` variety '' of periodic points @xmath6 which is given by only the invariants @xmath7 the ivpp has an important property which is called the ivpp theorem@xcite@xcite@xcite :    _ let f be a @xmath0 dimensional `` rational '' map with @xmath3 invariants . if @xmath8 , an ivpp and discrete periodic points on a level set of any period do not exist in one map , simultaneously . _",
    "the ivpp theorem gives an essential information of the integrability of the map . because a julia set@xcite which characterizes a non integrable system is given by the closure of the sum set of discrete `` repulsive '' periodic points on a level set .",
    "therefore it seems that the existence of ivpp / julia set is incompatible with the existence of julia set / ivpp .",
    "this conjecture leads to the sufficient conditions of the integrability of a map as follows :    _ if a map @xmath9 has an ivpp / julia set then the map @xmath9 is integrable / non integrable . _    in particular , the reason why the ivpp is interesting , is a phenomenon that periodic points become a set of continuum points .",
    "there have been derived many ivpps of various maps in the form of algebraic varieties , however , there have never been investigated the structure of an ivpp in detail .",
    "one of our purposes of this paper is to explore the component structure of an ivpp . on the other hand it was known@xcite",
    "that , when a map is restricted on the ivpp of period @xmath10 it provides a recurrence equation@xcite@xcite of period @xmath10 , an equation whose solutions are @xmath10 periodic for all initial points .",
    "we show that a @xmath0 dimensional recurrence equation has a discrete symmetry , hence it gives a decomposition of the @xmath0 dimensional space to `` fundamental domains '' .",
    "in other words , components of ivpp are given by fundamental domains of the recurrence equation which is a restriction map on ivpp . hence comparing these two objects",
    "we will find a relation of components of ivpp and fundamental domains of recurrence equation as follows :    _ components of ivpp @xmath11 fundamental domains of recurrence equation _",
    "in addition , we give an algorithm to derive components of ivpp for all rational maps at the final section .",
    "this structure tells us an important information , how points move on ivpps . in this paper , we show two concrete examples of such component structure of ivpps which are restricted by the cyclotomic polynomial@xcite of the recurrence maps .",
    "first , we introduce a 2 dimensional map and its ivpps@xcite .      @xmath12    with an invariant @xmath13 @xmath14      we know general formula of the ivpps([ivpp ] ) of the map([map ] ) as follows@xcite : @xmath15 and explicit forms , which will be discussed in this paper , as follows : @xmath16    ) ]      in this subsection , we give components of the ivpp of the map([map ] ) .",
    "first , we give the flow of points on the ivpp of period 3 by symbolic calculus which is parametrized by @xmath17 as follows : @xmath18 now , we can give boundaries of components of the ivpp of period 3 in the @xmath17 direction by the substitution @xmath19 for @xmath17 of ( [ seq ] ) .",
    "therefore we get the components of the ivpp of period 3 in the @xmath17 direction @xmath20 as follows , @xmath21 @xmath22 we can draw a picture of `` tiling '' of the ivpp of period 3 .     :",
    "red , @xmath23 : blue , @xmath24 : green . ]",
    "all other periods are to be discussed in almost the same way of the case of period 3 :    flow of points on the ivpp of period 4 : @xmath25    components of the ivpp of period 4 in the @xmath17 direction @xmath26 as follows : @xmath27 @xmath28     : red , @xmath29 : blue , @xmath30 : green , @xmath31 : pink . ]",
    "the flow of points on the ivpp of period 5 are as follows , @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "we notice that the ivpp of period 5 is multivalued dependent on @xmath34 , hence we must discuss them separately .",
    "we get components of ivpp of period 5 @xmath35 as follows , @xmath36 @xmath37     of components of ivpp of period 5 , @xmath38 : red , @xmath39 : blue , @xmath40 : green , @xmath41 : pink , @xmath42 : gold . ]     of components of ivpp of period 5 , @xmath43 : red , @xmath44 : blue , @xmath45 : green , @xmath46 : pink , @xmath47 : gold . ]      the flow of points on the ivpp of period 6 is as follows : @xmath48 therefore we get components of ivpp of period 6 as follows : @xmath49 @xmath50     : red , @xmath51 : blue , @xmath52 : green , @xmath53 : pink , @xmath54 : gold , @xmath55 : yellow . ]",
    "in this section , we discuss the structure of the components of ivpps of the map ( [ map ] ) .",
    "the map([map ] ) is reduced by the invariant as follows : @xmath56 or in the linear map form @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "it is a mbius map .",
    "furthermore , we can transform @xmath59 to a diagonal matrix by coordinate transformation as @xmath60 therefore , we get a diagonal form of ( [ mob ] ) as follows : @xmath61 where the @xmath62 are eigenvalues of @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , if we take a new invariant @xmath63 then the map ( [ mob2 ] ) is just a scale transformation @xmath64 this fact means that the ivpp of ( [ mob2 ] ) of period @xmath10 is given by a cyclotomic polynomial@xcite : @xmath65 hence the components of the ivpp of period @xmath10 of the map([mob2 ] ) is equivalent to an orbifold @xmath66 :    cc    ]    ]    we give a formula of @xmath17 direction boundaries @xmath67 of the components of ivpps of period @xmath10 as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 satisfies the @xmath10-order cyclotomic polynomial .",
    "furthermore , a formula in @xmath70 space is also given by @xmath71 these formulas are given by the pull buck the @xmath72 iterated map ( [ mob2 ] ) to the @xmath72 iterated map ( [ mob ] ) as follows , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the diagonalization matrix of @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath17 direction boundaries are given by the substitution @xmath19 for @xmath17 .",
    "therefore we can get the formula([formula ] ) .    finally , we give one more point of view about the boundaries of components of the ivpp .",
    "we substitute @xmath19 for @xmath17 of the flow on the ivpp , hence the boundaries are given by the `` intersections of the ivpp and zero points set of denominators of iterations of the map '' .",
    "we draw a graph of zero points set of the denominators of iterations of the map ( [ map ] ) as follows :    ) , @xmath9 : red , @xmath75 : green , @xmath76 : yellow , @xmath77 : blue , @xmath78 : purple , @xmath79 : light blue . ]",
    "next , we try to discuss 3 dimensional case . in particular , we discuss about the 3 dimensional lotka - volterra map@xcite , and only the ivpp of period 2 , because higher dimensional cases and higher period cases are difficult to write symbolic calculus and decompositions .",
    "@xmath80    with invariants @xmath81 , @xmath82      we know some conditions of the ivpps of the map ( [ lvmap ] ) as follows@xcite : @xmath83 we draw the ivpp of period 2 in fig . [ lvivpp ] .",
    "similar to the case of 2 dimensional map , we give a symbolic calculus on ivpp of period 2 .",
    "@xmath84 where @xmath85 this case also is multivalued .",
    "therefore we get components of ivpp of period 2 as follows : @xmath86_x= ( -\\infty , 0 ] , \\quad [ ( c_{2_\\pm 2})_1]_x= ( 0 , 1 ] , \\quad [ ( c_{2_\\pm 1})_2]_x= ( 1 , \\infty ] , \\quad [ ( c_{2_\\pm 2})_2]_x= ( 1 , \\infty].\\ ] ]     of components of ivpp of period 2 , @xmath87 : red , @xmath88 : blue , @xmath87 : green , @xmath89 : pink . ]     of components of ivpp of period 2 , @xmath90 : red , @xmath91 : blue , @xmath90 : green , @xmath92 : pink . ]    here , we notice that each graph has two kinds of tiling , _",
    "i.e. , _ red and blue pair and green pink pair in both the fig .",
    "11 and fig . 12 .",
    "it is a new phenomenon .",
    "in addition , we should give a remark about the reason of appearance of the striped pattern of tilings of the ivpp .",
    "the ivpp of period 2 is given by the condition as follows , @xmath93 then the ivpp of period 2 has a free parameter @xmath94 which is not restricted by this condition",
    ". therefore we draw graphs by showing stripes corresponding to the parameter of invariant @xmath94 which is stepped by @xmath95 for visibility . in other words ,",
    "each stripe is one of a level set corresponding to a part of ivpp . in general , any ivpps of the map([lvmap ] ) are given by one condition , hence we can solve the condition about @xmath96 .",
    "in other words , any ivpps are described by one parameter @xmath94 .",
    "we give a small remark about the relation of decompositions of ivpp and fundamental domains of the recurrence equation .",
    "the recurrence equation of period 2 is a restriction on ivpp of period 2 of the map([lvmap ] ) as follows : @xmath97 we notice that the map([lvre ] ) is independent on the parameter @xmath94 . in a similar way as the case of 2 dimensional map([map ] ) , we can get a diagonal form @xmath98 and the fundamental domain is given by @xmath99 .",
    "in order to conclude this paper we would like to give our algorithm to determine the components of ivpp for all rational maps :    _ algorithm _    * give an initial point @xmath100 on ivpp .",
    "if ivpp is multivalued , then we must use our algorithm for all parts .",
    "* symbolic calculation of the mapping on the ivpp of period @xmath10 : @xmath101 * substitution for a minimum value of domain of parameters @xmath102 of the ivpp of period @xmath10 for any points @xmath103 . * changing the parameters of step 2 to positive direction ,",
    "until go to other components .",
    "* if there exists a non discussed domain when finished the above operations , then go to step 3 for non discussed domain .",
    "* therefore we get component family of the ivpp of period @xmath10 in the @xmath104 direction about parameters @xmath105 .    in conclusion , above discussions give a relation of decomposition of ivpp and the tiling as follows : @xmath106",
