    "derived from jacobi s integral , the long - term value of this quantity is largely conserved in the restricted three - body problem @xcite , even in the event of close encounters with the planetary perturber @xcite .    in the study of small solar system body dynamics ,",
    "the tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter , @xmath0 , is frequently employed as a discriminant between asteroids and comets .",

    "the expression for @xmath3 is derived using an idealized physical approximation in which the orbit of the planetary perturber is assumed to be circular ( @xmath7@xmath10 ) and non - inclined ( @xmath8@xmath10@xmath11 ) , but jupiter s actual orbit has both non - zero @xmath7 and non - zero @xmath8 ( @xmath12@xmath10.0489 ; @xmath13@xmath11.304@xmath11 ) .",

    "@xcite demonstrated that near - earth objects ( neos ) with @xmath0@xmath103 ( sometimes referred to as asteroids in cometary orbits , or acos , in the literature ) showed significantly lower albedos than neos with @xmath0@xmath93 , consistent with the low-@xmath0 objects being dormant or extinct comet nuclei .",
    "this finding led @xcite and @xcite to use a combination of low albedos and low @xmath0 values to identify extinct comet candidates in other neo surveys .",
    "@xcite reported , however , that dynamical models indicated that @xmath235% of low - albedo @xmath0@xmath143 neos were likely to originate from the outer asteroid belt , not the outer solar system as their @xmath0 values might normally suggest .",

    "@xcite similarly found a reflectivity gradient distribution more consistent with outer main - belt asteroids than with cometary nuclei , though cautioned that their results were preliminary .    while physical studies indicate that @xmath0 is probably a reasonable first - order indication of an object s probable dynamical origin , the aforementioned caveats mean that it should not be regarded as an absolute criterion .",
    "plots of the orbital elements of the first 50000 numbered asteroids and all comets catalogued by the minor planet center as of 2014 april 1 ( figure  [ figure : asteroids_comets_tiss ] ) shows that most asteroids have @xmath0@xmath93 , and most comets have @xmath0@xmath103 , though there are some asteroids with @xmath0@xmath103 and a handful of comets with @xmath0@xmath93 .",
    "in particular , jovian trojan asteroids ( @xmath6@xmath155.2  au ) and hilda asteroids ( @xmath6@xmath153.9@xmath164.0  au ) comprise a large portion of the @xmath0@xmath103 asteroid population .",
    "there are also some @xmath0@xmath103 asteroids within the @xmath6 bounds of the main asteroid belt ( between the 4:1 and 2:1 mean - motion resonances , or mmrs , with jupiter ) , where these objects have larger @xmath7 , larger @xmath8 , or both , relative to the rest of the main - belt asteroid population .",
    "notably , we see that the vast majority of comets in figure  [ figure : asteroids_comets_tiss ] have perihelion distances , @xmath17 , within 1.5 hill radii ( 1.5@xmath18 ) of jupiter s perihelion , @xmath19 , or beyond , indicating the possibility of very close encounters with the planet and therefore a strong degree of dynamical coupling . meanwhile , the vast majority of main - belt asteroids ( hilda and jovian trojan asteroids aside ) do not have @xmath17 closer than 1.5@xmath18 from @xmath19 , indicating a low degree of dynamical coupling .",
    "we therefore find that the locus of orbits in @xmath6-@xmath7 space with @xmath17@xmath1@xmath19@xmath16@xmath20 forms a reasonably effective alternative dynamical dividing line separating main - belt asteroids and jupiter - family comets , consistent with the findings of @xcite .    continuing to study figure  [ figure : asteroids_comets_tiss ]",

    "attempts have been made in the past to find plausible dynamical pathways by which jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) could possibly have evolved onto mbc - like orbits , given the unexpectedness of objects on apparently dynamically stable main - belt orbits currently exhibiting active sublimation , but no such pathways were found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the results of numerical integrations attesting to the long - term dynamical stability of individual mbcs @xcite appears to indicate that those objects have resided in their current locations in the asteroid belt for some time , and may have even originated there .",
    "there are however a few mbcs which have been found to be unstable on timescales of @xmath21  myr at their present locations , suggesting that they can not have resided there for long and must have originated elsewhere ( e.g. , 238p and 259p ; * ? ? ?",

    "we are interested in understanding to what extent @xmath0 and other dynamical characteristics can be used to infer information about an object s possible dynamical origin based on current orbital elements .",
    "the presumed in - situ formation of mbcs is the foundation on which efforts to use them as tracers of primordial ice in the inner solar system are based . as such",
    ", it is very important to determine whether objects currently on main - belt - like orbits can in fact be assumed to be native to the main asteroid belt , or if non - native objects ( e.g. , from the outer solar system ) may be able to occasionally assume main - belt - like orbits , and thus effectively masquerade ( at least temporarily ) as members of the local native population .",
    "if the latter is the case , identifying the dynamical characteristics of such interlopers would then be very useful for improving our ability to exclude such objects when attempting to infer the distribution and abundance of inner solar system ice from the observed distribution of mbcs .",
    "this issue is of particular interest in astrobiology given that mbcs represent a potential means for constraining solar system formation models that posit that icy objects from the main asteroid belt may be a significant primordial source of earth s present - day water content .",
    "for this study , we seek to explore the range of dynamical paths that could be followed by small solar system objects in a designated region of interest in orbital element space ( i.e. , near the canonical @xmath0@xmath13 boundary between asteroids and comets ) , with the ultimate objective of determining the degree to which an object s osculating orbital elements ( or a parameter derived from those elements , e.g. , @xmath0 ) at some arbitrary point in its dynamical evolution can be relied upon to infer its dynamical history . to accomplish this",
    ", we conducted relatively short - duration integrations of a large number of test particles with starting orbital elements meeting our specified criteria .",
    "specifically , we generated a sample of 10000 test particles spanning a range of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 values required to produce starting @xmath0 values ( @xmath22 ) of 2.80@xmath10@xmath22@xmath103.20 , with the expectation that particles close to the canonical dividing line between asteroids and comets should be the most likely to cross that boundary , and thus represent the most interesting cases for study . to create these test particles , we randomly selected starting @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 values from within pre - defined ranges ( 2.8@xmath10@xmath22@xmath103.2 , @xmath23@xmath10@xmath25 , and 0@xmath10@xmath24@xmath100.99 , where @xmath25@xmath15.204  au ) , and then computed the corresponding @xmath26 value needed to produce the selected @xmath22 value for each test particle .",
    "sets of @xmath23 and @xmath24 for which no value of @xmath26 could produce the target @xmath22 value were discarded and regenerated",
    ". finally , random values between @xmath27 to @xmath28 were selected as arguments of perihelion , longitudes of ascending nodes , and mean anomalies .",
    "the starting orbital elements of all of our test particles generated in this way , separated into individual @xmath22 bins for added clarity , are plotted in figure  [ figure : testparticles_distribution ] .",
    "of course , by generating test particles that span the entire region of orbital element space where 2.80@xmath10@xmath22@xmath103.20 , we sample portions of orbital element space that are only sparsely populated , if at all , by real solar system objects , as can be seen by comparing figures  [ figure : asteroids_comets_tiss ] and [ figure : testparticles_distribution ] . in particular , our initial test particle set includes objects on polar orbits ( i.e. , @xmath26@xmath1590@xmath11 ) and retrograde orbits ( i.e. , with @xmath26@xmath990@xmath11 ) . our goal in performing this general study , though , is to fully explore the available parameter space to search for possible dynamical pathways for particles defined by a specific dynamical criterion ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) , and investigate what additional dynamical criteria , if any , are able to specify or exclude particular pathways of interest .",
    "we conducted `` snapshot '' integrations of all test particles by integrating each of their orbits forward ( using 10-day timesteps ) for 2  myr using the bulirsch - ster integrator in the mercury numerical integration software package @xcite .",
    "the length of our snapshot integrations was chosen so that our study would not require an unmanageably large expenditure of computing resources , while still producing physically meaningful results .",
    "@xcite found a median dynamical lifetime of @xmath30  years for short - period comets before ejection from the solar system or collision with the sun , and so our integration period of 2  myr should extend past the dynamical lifetimes of most of the comet - like particles in our integrations .",
    "of course , our chosen integration length means that our results are not appropriate for characterizing the evolution of test particles over much longer timescales , such as the age of the solar system , but this does not mean they are not physically meaningful . since we are considering the dynamical evolution of fictitious test particles distributed throughout our orbital element space region of interest in this study , our test particles can be thought of as both representing different individual objects , and also different stages of the long - term dynamical evolution of single objects , hence our characterization of these integrations as snapshot integrations .",
    "considering the situation from another perspective , longer integrations would certainly more directly characterize the long - term dynamical behavior of our test particles , but in no cases would they be expected to exclude or prevent any dynamical behavior observed during shorter integration periods . as such , our snapshot integrations can be considered entirely applicable to the study of both the short - term and long - term dynamical evolution of our test particles .    for these integrations , we treated the sun and the eight major planets as massive bodies ( where the mass of mercury was added to that of the sun ) and all test particles as massless bodies .",
    "non - gravitational effects were not included .    for reference",
    ", we used the same experimental design as we used for our test particles to study the dynamical evolution of known comets . since our interest is in comets in the inner solar system , we restrict our sample to those comets with @xmath31 .",
    "we created a set of test particles with the orbital elements of the 639 comets catalogued by the mpc as of 2014 january 1 that met our orbital criteria .",
    "we also created four additional dynamical clones per comet to account for possible chaotic effects due to orbital element uncertainties , giving a total of 3195 cometary test particles and dynamical clones . for the latter task",
    ", we utilized code that generates an arbitrary number of clones of an object that are gaussian - distributed in orbital element space , centered on the object s osculating orbital elements , and have a distribution characterized by the 1-@xmath32 uncertainties of the orbital elements of those objects ( previously used by * ? ? ?",

    "we plot histograms of the dynamical lifetimes of the comets and their clones in each @xmath22 bin ( figure  [ figure : timeejec_comets ] ) , where the dynamical lifetime of an object is the amount of time it spends in the integration before reaching @xmath33  au and is considered to have been ejected from the solar system , reaching @xmath34 , or colliding with a planet or the sun .",
    "one caveat is that current orbital elements are not available for all comets . since our integrations were all run from a single starting epoch , it was therefore necessary to integrate objects with non - updated orbital elements up to the present epoch , and in some cases , objects were eliminated from the integrations before even reaching the current epoch . for the purposes of this analysis , the dynamical lifetimes for these objects were recorded as being zero years .",
    "overall , we find that @xmath3595% of our comet test particles are lost prior to the end of our 2  myr integrations ( consistent with the results of integrations of jfcs by @xcite over an identical integration period ) , indicating that our integrations are indeed longer than the dynamical lifetimes of most comets in the inner solar system .",
    "we also immediately see that the dynamical behavior of comets with @xmath36 is extremely similar to those with @xmath37 , indicating that @xmath38 may not in fact be an appropriate dividing line between comet - like and asteroid - like orbits .",

    "no appreciable differences in dynamical lifetimes were seen for comets with semimajor axes interior to and exterior to the 2:1 mmr with jupiter ( i.e. , the outer boundary of the main asteroid belt ) .",
    "the short ( @xmath41  myr ) dynamical lifetime of a typical comet is a key dynamical characteristic indicating a likely recent insertion onto an inner - solar - system - crossing orbit given the low likelihood of it residing on that orbit for significantly longer than its calculated dynamical lifetime . as such , hereafter",

    "even so , some actually have similar dynamical lifetimes as have been found for other less stable mbcs ( @xmath5220 - 30  myr ; section  [ section : mbc_origins_extended ] ) . in one of those cases ,",
    "@xcite concluded that the relative instability of 259p indicated that it was only recently transported to its current location in the inner main belt , and considering its high @xmath0 value , suggested that it could have originated from the outer main belt .",
    "however , @xcite found that collisional processes , the yarkovsky effect , and other dynamical interactions produce only minimal mixing of main - belt material between the different major regions of the asteroid belt ( as delineated by the @xmath64 , 3:1 , and 5:2 resonances ) .",
    "the work presented here provides new support to the possibility that these less stable mbcs could in fact have originated outside the asteroid belt .",
    "our results suggest a possible mechanism by which some interlopers , or at least their fragments , could actually attain orbits that are stable for longer periods of time by entering the main belt via mmrs and then undergoing catastrophic collisional fragmentations ( i.e. , the scenario mimicked in section  [ section : mbc_origins_extended ] ) .",
    "if some of the pieces from such a break - up were then able to gain sufficient separation from the associated mmr due to the velocity kicks imparted by the fragmentation event , they might be able to move onto substantially more stable orbits , free from the destabilizing influence of the mmr ( cf .  figure  [ figure : mbparticles ] ) .",
    "this would essentially represent the opposite mechanism suggested for the _ ejection _ of main - belt asteroids near mmrs onto near - earth orbits @xcite .",
    "additional work accounting for catastrophic collision rates and realistic ejection velocity fields are certainly needed though to determine the efficiency of this process and also the expected rate of such events in the modern ( i.e. , post - planetary - migration ) solar system .    in our integrations ,",
    "the transition from a comet - like orbit to a main - belt - like orbit occurs on timescales well in excess of the typical physical lifetime of a jfc ( i.e. , the length of the period over which sublimation - driven cometary activity is observed before mantling or depletion of volatile material causes observable activity to stop ) , estimated by @xcite to be on the order of tens of kyr .",
    "however , ice could still be preserved in subsurface reservoirs on these ostensibly inert objects even after sustained cometary activity has stopped ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as such , the long dynamical timescales involved for a comet - like object to transition to a main - belt - like one is not at odds with our current understanding of mbcs as objects with subsurface ice that only sublimates occasionally , for example , upon excavation by an impact ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    these results could potentially account for the origin of d - type asteroids found throughout the main belt @xcite .",
    "d - type objects are more typically found at distances larger than in the main asteroid belt , particularly among the hilda asteroids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the jovian trojans ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some cometary nuclei , presumably originating in the even more distant outer solar system , have also been found to have d - type - like spectra ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite speculated that the parent bodies of present - day d - type main - belt asteroids could have been implanted into the outer asteroid belt during the era of planetary migration ( cf .",
    "* ) and then distributed throughout the asteroid belt via a combination of catastrophic fragmentation of the parent bodies and yarkovsky - driven transport across the major main - belt mmrs .",
    "alternatively , they could have been implanted during the early inward and outward migration of jupiter proposed under the grand tack model @xcite .",
    "our results show , however , that it may be possible for such objects to be implanted in the main asteroid belt even in the present day from gravitational interactions alone .",
    "these results of our integrations are significant in that they indicate that a non - mars - crossing and non - jupiter - crossing orbit with @xmath0@xmath93.05 observed at some particular point in time may not be a definitive indication of in situ formation in the inner solar system . in the context of using mbcs as compositional tracers ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this means that care must be taken when considering what portion of the mbc population can be used to infer the primordial distribution of water ice in the early solar system .",
    "our results indicate that mbcs observed to currently have both low @xmath7 and low @xmath8 may be considered reasonably likely to have formed in situ , but there is a non - negligible possibility that some mbcs observed to currently have both large @xmath7 and large @xmath8 could actually be jfc - like interlopers ( consistent with the findings of * ? ? ?",
    "as such , we suggest that this segment of the mbc population may not be completely reliable compositional tracers of the early solar system at their current locations , and should only be used as such with caution .    on the other hand , the reliability of mbcs with both low @xmath7 and low @xmath8 as compositional tracers appears to be more secure .",
    "our integrations show that even this segment of the mbc population could be occasionally infiltrated by comet - like interlopers , but that these interlopers may be identifiable by short individual residence times in that region of orbital element space ( though additional work is needed to give this preliminary conclusion more detailed context ) .",
    "one point is clear : mbcs should not be considered to be a monolithic population with similar origins .",
    "we are now seeing hints of distinct dynamical classes of mbcs with distinct dynamical origins emerge , and need to account for these different origins when attempting to use them to infer conditions in the early solar system .      in this study",
    ", we sought to explore the full orbital parameter space of possible inner solar system objects close to the dynamical boundary between asteroids and comets , meaning that test particle set we considered here does not reflect the real distribution of small bodies in the inner solar system .",
    "as such , while our results have revealed possible dynamical pathways via which jfcs might transition , at least temporarily , from comet - like orbits to main - belt - like orbits , we can not use these particular integrations to ascertain the real - world rate of jfcs undergoing such transitions .",
    "follow - up studies using test particle sets that more accurately represent the real - world comet population ( e.g. , in terms of both orbital element distribution and size distribution , and perhaps also the real - world distribution of longitudes of perihelion with respect to jupiter s ) would be extremely useful for clarifying this issue .",
    "when attempting to determine the fraction of previously jfc - like interlopers in the main belt at any given time , such studies should also take into account the shorter residence times that many of these interlopers appear to have relative to other more stable main - belt objects .",
    "more realistic representations of fragmentation events in the asteroid belt ( i.e. , including realistic ejection velocity fields and fragment size distributions for given impact , impactor , and target properties ) would also be very useful for determining the rate at which interlopers in the main belt might produce a cluster of dynamically similar objects , some of which might find their way onto stable orbits similar to those of known mbcs or known d - type main - belt asteroids , despite the instability of the original interlopers themselves ( cf .",
    "section  [ section : mbc_origins_extended ] ) .",
    "calculations of proper elements and lyapunov times for simulated interlopers and comparison of the results to those of real - world asteroids in the same regions of osculating orbital element space may also aid efforts to identify more reliable distinguishing characteristics between previously jfc - like interlopers in the main belt and native objects .",
    "additionally , as discussed in section  [ section : mbc_origins_detailed ] , detailed analyses of the dynamical behaviors exhibited while in the main belt by objects with initially comet - like orbits that attain main - belt - like orbits ( ideally involving a larger number of independent particles meeting those criteria than we find in this work ) , as well as studies of the efficiency of various mmrs ( or combinations of mmrs ) in the temporary stabilization of initially comet - like objects that transition onto main - belt - like orbits and the typical lifetimes of objects captured by different mmrs would be extremely valuable .",
    "another area for improvement for this work would be the inclusion of non - gravitational forces .",
    "we do not expect that including either the yarkovsky effect or outgassing forces will negate the main result of this work , that objects with comet - like orbits could occasionally evolve onto main - belt - like orbits , since there is no reason to expect that those effects would _ prevent _ the dynamical behavior we have already observed with purely gravitational integrations . if anything , non - gravitational forces would likely cause such evolution to occur on even shorter timescales ( cf .",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , increase the number of objects undergoing such evolution , or both .",
    "non - gravitational effects could also increase the rate of interlopers that first enter the main belt via mmrs and then escape the influence of those mmrs to attain more stable main - belt orbits ( cf .",
    "section  [ section : mbc_origins_extended ] ) , since we do not expect that non - gravitational forces would preferentially confine objects within mmrs .",
    "actual numerical integrations including non - gravitational forces would quantify the degree to which all of these effects occur .",
    "lastly , while the evolution of main - belt objects onto comet - like orbits is not the main focus of this work , our integrations indicate that there could be a non - zero interloper component in the jfc population consisting of objects from the main asteroid belt . given these preliminary dynamical results and the growing evidence that main - belt objects could contain significant quantities of volatile material ( e.g. , mbcs , detection of water ice on themis , detection of outgassing from ceres ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the possibility that some outgassing objects on cometary orbits could actually have originated in the asteroid belt should be investigated in more detail .",
    "this issue is of particular importance given that compositional studies of comets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are frequently interpreted assuming outer solar system origins for the objects in question , but these interpretations might change if there is instead a non - trivial possibility of an inner solar system origin for any given jfc .",
    "numerical integrations of a realistic asteroid population focusing on objects that escape the main belt would help quantify the rate at which the jfc population is contaminated by such interlopers , and therefore how much concern we should have for this possibility when interpreting compositional studies of comets .",
    "in this work , we present the results of numerical integrations of 10000 test particles with starting tisserand parameter values of 2.80@xmath10@xmath22@xmath103.20 aimed at investigating the dynamical origins of main - belt comets .",
    "key results are as follows :    1 .",
    "as expected , we find that the tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter , @xmath0 , for individual test particles is not always a reliable indicator of their initial orbit types , and for many test particles , is seen to cross the canonical @xmath38 ( or @xmath42 ) line that ostensibly separates asteroids ( assumed to originate in the inner solar system ) and comets ( assumed to originate in the outer solar system ) .",
    "test particles with @xmath65 are found to spend on the order of 30% of their time over the course of 2  myr integrations on the opposite side of the @xmath42 boundary from where they began .",
    "meanwhile , even test particles with @xmath37 are found to spend @xmath525% of their time over the course of 2  myr integrations with @xmath66 , and test particles with @xmath40 are found to spend a similar amount of time with @xmath67 .",
    "2 .   of the test particles in our sample set with starting orbital elements similar to those of real - world jfcs , a few percent reach main - belt - like orbits at some point in their first 2  myr of evolution . as our initial test particle set is not an accurate representation of the real - world jfc population , this rate should not be regarded to accurately reflect reality .",
    "test integrations of dynamical clones of real jfcs showing similar behavior , though , suggests that the fraction of real - world jfcs occasionally reaching main - belt - like orbits may be on the order of @xmath520.1 - 1% , although the fraction that remain on such orbits for appreciable lengths of time is certainly far lower .",
    "for this reason , the number of such objects in the main - belt population at any given time is likely to be small , but still non - zero .",
    "the main - belt - like orbits that are reached by test particles with comet - like starting orbital elements in our integrations appear to be largely prevented from simultaneously having both low eccentricities and low inclinations .",
    "this suggests that despite our findings that comet - like objects can occasionally infiltrate the main asteroid belt , objects found in this particular region of orbital element space may be largely free of this potential jfc contamination and may be more reliably considered likely to have formed in situ .",
    "main - belt comets in this region may therefore provide a more reliable means for tracing the primordial ice content of the main asteroid belt than the main - belt comet population ( which includes some objects on high - inclination , high - eccentricity orbits ) as a whole .",
    "detailed investigation of the orbital evolution of test particles with comet - like starting orbital elements that have main - belt - like orbital elements at the end of our integrations indicates that they may reach those main - belt - like orbits largely via a combination of gravitational interactions with the terrestrial planets and temporary trapping by mmrs .",
    "additional studies are required , however , to confirm this explanation , and also to ascertain the efficacy of this process for real jfcs .",
    "5 .   extended 100-myr integrations of sets of dynamical clones ( generated to roughly mimic the orbital element distribution of very young asteroid clusters , or alternatively the results of a random set of orbital perturbations due to non - gravitational effects like the yarkovsky effect or outgassing ) of the test particles that have comet - like starting orbital elements but are found to have main - belt - like orbital elements at the end of our initial 2-myr integrations show that most of the original test particles become unstable on timescales of @xmath5315  myr , though two remain stable for @xmath5230 - 70  myr . in three of these clone sets ,",
    "however , @xmath5530% of the cloned test particles are found to remain stable for @xmath35100  myr , on par with stability lifetimes found for other mbcs .",
    "some of these cloned particles are found to attain orbits with simultaneously low eccentricities and low inclinations , but only for @xmath531  myr at a time , suggesting that such short individual residence times could be a way to distinguish such interlopers from native objects in this region of orbital element space .",
    "our results suggest a possible mechanism for delivering outer solar system material onto stable main - belt - like orbits whereby comet - like objects evolve onto unstable main - belt orbits via terrestrial planet interactions and mmr trapping , and then experience catastrophic collisional disruptions , resulting in some portion of the resulting fragments gaining sufficient separation from their associated mmrs and attaining stable main - belt orbits .",
    "however , more work involving test particle sets that better represent the real - world population of jfcs , and also including non - gravitational forces , realistic collision rates , and realistic ejection velocity fields is needed to quantify the nature and degree of this contamination .",
    "we briefly consider the potential for contamination of the jupiter - family comet population by main - belt objects , and find that while such contamination appears to be possible in principle , interlopers in the comet population with main - belt origins appear to be largely confined to the original semimajor axis boundaries of the main belt , meaning that the population of comet - like objects with semimajor axes beyond the 2:1 mmr with jupiter is likely to be largely free from interlopers from the main belt .",
    "more detailed study is needed to confirm this preliminary observation , however .",

    "<S> we present the results of `` snapshot '' numerical integrations of test particles representing comet - like and asteroid - like objects in the inner solar system aimed at investigating the short - term dynamical evolution of objects close to the dynamical boundary between asteroids and comets as defined by the tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter , @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath0@xmath13 ) . as expected , we find that @xmath0 for individual test particles is not always a reliable indicator of initial orbit types . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that a few percent of test particles with comet - like starting elements ( i.e. , similar to those of jupiter - family comets ) reach main - belt - like orbits ( at least temporarily ) during our 2  myr integrations , even without the inclusion of non - gravitational forces , apparently via a combination of gravitational interactions with the terrestrial planets and temporary trapping by mean - motion resonances with jupiter . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the fraction of real jupiter - family comets occasionally reaching main - belt - like orbits on myr timescales could be on the order of @xmath20.1 - 1% , although the fraction that remain on such orbits for appreciable lengths of time is certainly far lower . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> the number of jfc - like interlopers in the main - belt population at any given time is likely to be small , but still non - zero , a finding with significant implications for efforts to use apparently icy yet dynamically asteroidal main - belt comets as tracers of the primordial distribution of volatile material in the inner solar system . </S>",
    "<S> the test particles with comet - like starting orbital elements that transition onto main - belt - like orbits in our integrations appear to be largely prevented from reaching low eccentricity , low inclination orbits , suggesting that the real - world population of main - belt objects with both low eccentricities and inclinations may be largely free of this potential occasional jupiter - family comet contamination . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore find that low - eccentricity , low - inclination main - belt comets may provide a more reliable means for tracing the primordial ice content of the main asteroid belt than the main - belt comet population as a whole .    </S>",
