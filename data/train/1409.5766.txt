    "@xcite discovered four fast radio bursts ( frb ) whose large dispersion measures ( dm ) and high galactic latitudes indicated that their sources were at cosmological distances . frb 110220 had an observed dedispersed width @xmath6 ms ( at a frequency @xmath7 mhz ) , while only upper limits on @xmath8 were found for the remaining three frb .",
    "@xcite discovered frb 011025 for which @xmath9 ms . fitting @xmath10 , both these frb had scattering indices @xmath11 in agreement with the predicted @xmath12 for multipath propagation spreading in a refractively scattering plasma medium .",
    "two other frb , 010621 @xcite and 121102 @xcite , had measured widths but these widths were not attributed to scattering ; these frb occurred at low galactic latitudes , hinting that they may be galactic .",
    "we do not discuss them explicitly , but their parameters are similar to those of frb 110220 and frb 011025 , with similar implications if the same assumptions are made .",
    "this paper explores the implications of the assumptions that the dedispersed pulse widths of frb are a consequence of scattering in intergalactic plasma and that the dispersion measures indicate cosmological distances .",
    "any explanation of these observations must account for two facts : ( 1 ) all frb have dispersion measures within a range of a factor of about two ( three if the lorimer burst @xcite is accepted as an frb ) , implying a universal property , not an unusual circumstance such as a line of sight that happens to intersect a rare dense cloud ; ( 2 ) the dispersion index is very close to @xmath3 , and consistent with exactly @xmath3 , implying an upper bound on the density of the dispersing plasma and a lower bound on its size .",
    "these facts are readily accounted for if dispersion occurs in the intergalactic medium , but this appears inconsistent with the pulse broadening , interpreted as the result of scattering .",

    "much smaller @xmath77 and @xmath112 and larger @xmath68 than the bounds are possible .",
    "the bounds also admit a protogalaxy or starburst ionized by an initial generation of hot luminous stars , providing the observed dispersion measures .",
    "such sites may be plausible locales for frb , but give no clues to the origin of the frb themselves beyond indicating a relation with massive stars and high rates of star formation and death .",
    "as argued in sections [ where ] and [ parameters ] , these clouds can not be the origin of the observed pulse widths , but may contribute a major part of the total dispersion measures .",
    "the central results ( [ ne ] ) , ( [ epsn2 ] ) and ( [ epsd ] ) of this paper are that the pulses of frb 110220 and 011025 , the two frb with pulse widths attributed to scattering , scattered in high density regions close to their sources",
    ". we also infer , from the closeness of the dispersion indices to their low density value of @xmath3 , that dispersion occurred in a region where the electron density was close to the bound ( [ nemin ] ) and that a significant part of the dispersion occurred close to the source .",

    "these results depend on the assumption @xmath75 .",
    "this assumption could be violated in many ways .",
    "for example , the pulse width might have been produced by the reverberation of radio emission in a cavity of size @xmath166 if the walls of the cavity had a plasma density above the critical density @xmath167@xmath5 for 1300 mhz radiation and the interior had a lower , perhaps much lower , density .",

    ", if scattering occurs in a thin comparatively dense sheet @xmath169 , where @xmath170 , and there may be evidence for such sheets in our galaxy ( [ psrj1745 ] , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper began by assuming that the frb are at the cosmological distances inferred from their dispersion measures , allowing only for the estimated galactic dispersions @xcite .",
    "as shown in section  [ dindex ] , this is only marginally consistent with the dispersion indices .",
    "the fact that for both frb ( 110220 and 011025 ) whose pulse widths are attributed to scattering the consistency between ( [ nebound ] ) and ( [ nemin ] ) is only marginal should be of concern .",
    "it is _ a priori _ surprising that both objects should be found in the same corner of the allowable parameter space , the range of plasma densities allowed by the pulse widths , which hints at a fundamental problem with the model .",
    "this suggests that for some , as yet undiscovered , frb , either a significant deviation from the low density plasma dispersion index @xmath171 will be found , or there will be a frank inconsistency between the observed @xmath61 and that inferred from ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ nebound ] ) .",
    "such an inconsistency may require reconsideration of the interpretation of the pulse widths as the effects of scattering or of the dispersion measures as indicating cosmological distances , as @xcite and @xcite have done on other grounds .",
    "if so , the distances are smaller than inferred from the dispersion measures , perhaps by large factors .    if we reject the inference of cosmological distances then various bounds change .",

    "the observation of frb in a single beam at parkes , in contrast to perytons @xcite , indicates a distance @xmath0 km , outside the first fresnel zone , consistent with a radar satellite .",
    "there is no obvious reason for a radar to have a chirp @xmath178 as observed , nor is there obvious reason not .",
    "however , the observed dispersed pulse durations of several tenths of a second would imply , for monostatic radar , target distances of at least half that many light seconds to avoid interference of the transmission with the received scattered radiation . at such distances @xmath179 cm the return would be undetectably weak .",
    "in contrast , bistatic radar can use arbitrarily long pulses .",
    "the pulse repetition intervals would have to have been longer than the lengths of time the radars were anywhere in the 13 beams of the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( about 0.3 s for a radar in low earth orbit moving perpendicularly to a beam ) , yet the pulse durations must have been shorter than the time required to cross a single beam .",
    "this explanation would also require at least as many radar satellites , each with a different chirp rate , as frb because each frb had a different dispersion measure , or satellites whose chirp rates were variable in some non - obvious manner .",
    "this combination of requirements makes the hypothesis of interference by an orbital chirped source implausible .",

    "we predict a dispersion index @xmath197 the coefficient of the @xmath198 term is uncertain because the geometry is uncertain .",
    "its measurement would be the first demonstration in an astronomical context of the higher terms in ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "however , the assumption @xmath199 pc implies an angular size , ( fig .",
    "[ pathfig ] ) using ( [ theps ] ) , @xmath200 mas , in contradiction to the measured angular size , extrapolated to 1 ghz , of 900 mas @xcite .",
    "we therefore reject the hypothesis of thin screen scattering with @xmath201 pc .    by comparing the pulse broadening and",
    "angular size @xcite concluded that the scattering screen is actually @xmath202 kpc from the galactic center ( @xmath203 ) ; the special environment surrounding sgr a@xmath190 contributes little . using ( [ ne ] )",
    ", we find @xmath204 @xmath5 , an extraordinary electron density for interstellar space .",
    "if , rather than a single scattering sheet there are @xmath205 such sheets , @xmath38 is reduced by a factor @xmath206 .",
    "the requirement ( [ tauff ] ) @xmath207 implies a sheet thickness @xmath208 cm ( because @xmath209 this result is independent of @xmath205 ) and a contribution to the dispersion measure @xmath210 pc-@xmath5 .",
    "the thinness of this sheet , and the problem that it is found on the line of sight to psr j1745 - 2900 at the galactic center but nothing like it is found on lines of sight to other pulsars , is disturbing .",
    "the characteristic expansion time @xmath211 y , suggesting that changes in the pulse broadening , angular size , and possibly dm ( more accurately measurable , though proportionately smaller ) may be observable over a decade , offering the possibility of an independent test .",
    "each of the hypotheses for the location of a thin scattering screen meets serious objections : the hypothesis that it is within @xmath212 pc of the galactic center and of the pulsar implies an angular size nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than observed .",
    "the hypothesis that it is in the general interstellar medium at the distance ( 6 kpc from the galactic center and 2 kpc from us ) that reconciles the pulse broadening and angular width demands an uncomfortably high screen density and fails to explain why this line of sight , far from the unique galactic center , is special : lines of sight to other pulsars do nt intersect screens with similar parameters , as shown by the observation that their pulses are broadened ( at 1 ghz ) by @xmath213s , compared to about 1 s for psr j1745 - 2900 .    in order to resolve this problem ( the pulse broadening of psr j1745 - 2900 is too short for its angular size ; equivalently , its angular size is too wide for its pulse broadening ) we suggest that the radiation is refracted by plasma near its source , and that we are near a caustic or a focal point .",
    "this requires rejection of the _ ad hoc _ thin screen scattering model , in which there is no correlation between the scattering directions of adjacent points on the screen , and scattered radiation is delayed compared to unscattered radiation , or to that scattered by smaller angles . in contrast , all rays converging on a caustic or optical focus have the same travel time from the source because , by fermat s principle that travel time is an extremum , convergence is possible only for rays that have the same ( extremum ) travel time .",
    "this argument assumes the travel time is a continuous function of angular displacement ( the lens properties must be continuous functions of displacements perpendicular to the rays ) , and does not apply to fresnel lenses .",
    "the rays may have an arbitrarily broad angular distribution that depends on the geometry of the refracting medium .",
    "sources for which we are on a caustic or at a focus are brightened , perhaps explaining why the sole detected galactic center pulsar satisfies this unusual and unexpected condition .",
    "the observation of nonzero scattering widths for psr j1745 - 2900 with scattering index @xmath214 @xcite indicates that there is a contribution to the detected radiation that is described by the thin sheet scattering model .",
    "these arguments can not be applied to frb because no measurements of their angular sizes exist .",
    "interferometric detection of frb @xcite might permit measurements of their angular sizes , and be a critical test . a more quantitative investigation is the subject of ongoing work , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
