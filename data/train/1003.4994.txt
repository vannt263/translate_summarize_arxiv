    "quantum channels in modern quantum information theory  @xcite are modeled as completely positive and trace - preserving maps @xmath1 between the state spaces of quantum systems with hilbert spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the requirement of _ complete _ positivity means that @xmath4 is not just _ positive _ , mapping positive semidefinite operators to positive semidefinite operators , but that @xmath5 is positive for the identity map @xmath6 on any @xmath7 .",
    "this distinction plays a central role in the geometry of entanglement because positive but not completely positive maps can be used to identify entangled quantum states  @xcite .",
    "this paper will take as its starting point a similar observation about channel norms .",
    "the stinespring dilation theorem establishes a fundamental property of quantum channels : for every channel @xmath4 there exists an ancilla space @xmath8 and an isometry @xmath9 such that @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this means that quantum noise can always be interpreted as information loss in an otherwise deterministic evolution .",
    "since @xmath8 and @xmath11 are essentially unique ( up to unitary equivalence ) , each channel @xmath4 also has an associated _ complementary channel _ @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , which is uniquely defined up to coordinate changes of @xmath8 .    in quantum shannon theoretic error correction",
    "we try to find two channels @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( an encoder and decoder ) such that @xmath16 . for",
    "now we shall consider the encoding @xmath14 fixed , so that @xmath17 can be treated as a single channel .",
    "the central insight of quantum error correction  @xcite is that the existence of a decoding operation @xmath15 for a channel @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath18 is equivalent to the complementary channel being _ completely forgetful _ : for all hilbert spaces @xmath19 , @xmath20 with a universal relation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "here we determine a matching duality for the weaker property of the complementary channel being only ( approximately ) _ forgetful _ : @xmath23 that this is a much weaker property was noticed in the contexts of approximate encryption and remote state preparation  @xcite .",
    "the difference between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : completely.forget ] ) and ( [ eq : forget ] ) is precisely the difference between two norms on superoperators , the nave one inherited from the trace norm , and the so - called completely bounded norm  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , eq .  ( [ eq : forget ] ) will hold provided the main channel approximately preserves the pairwise fidelities between input pure states , a property we call _ geometry preservation _ : @xmath24 in fact , the reverse is also true .",
    "our investigations will revolve around the _ fidelity alternative _ , which asserts that a channel @xmath4 is geometry - preserving if and only if its complement @xmath25 is approximately forgetful , with dimension - independent functions relating @xmath26 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , an isometry with two outputs can preserve geometry to at most one of them .",
    "symmetrically , the isometry can be forgetful to at most one output .",
    "a single choice determines which output preserves geometry and which is forgetful ; this choice gives the principle its name .",
    "the geometry preservation property , though much weaker than transmission of quantum information , must nonetheless be considered a way of preserving coherence : by virtue of the fidelity alternative , geometry preservation can not be cloned . indeed ,",
    "if a channel has multiple outputs , one of which is geometry - preserving , then the rest must be forgetful .    via the fidelity alternative , the many known examples of approximately forgetful channels that are not completely forgetful also provide examples of geometry - preserving channels that are not correctable  @xcite .",
    "most strikingly , it is possible to preserve geometry while almost halving the number of qubits from input to output  @xcite . in that case , the geometry of the unit sphere in @xmath2 is necessarily encoded into the eigenvectors _ and _ eigenvalues of the much smaller output state on @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to quantum error correction , dimension counting reveals the mixedness of the output state to be crucial to preserving the geometry .",
    "some of the geometry of the input state space of pure quantum states is thus faithfully encoded as noise in the output state .",
    "moreover , the analogy with the quantum error correction duality can be made much stronger .",
    "there is a channel communication task very similar to quantum state transmission which is intimately related to geometry preservation : _ quantum identification",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "quantum identification is a cooperative communication game between two parties  conventionally called alice and bob  where alice has a given quantum state that she encodes in some way into the channel , and bob only wants to simulate measurements consisting of an arbitrary pure state projector and its complement , which can interpreted as performing the experiment asking `` is this the state ? ''",
    "the idea is that alice has an encoding channel @xmath14 and bob has , for every pure state @xmath27 , a povm @xmath28 such that @xmath29 such an object is called an _ @xmath21-quantum - id code_. ( the name is adapted from the classical case  @xcite . )",
    "note that bob measures the output of the channel , but the quality of the code is measured by how well the statistics of this measurement approximate the statistics of the ideal measurement he wants to perform on the message state . while it may seem that this is an odd way of defining a quantum communication task , normal quantum error correction can also be described this way ; namely , bob wants to be able to simulate _ all _ measurements on the message state .",
    "clearly , if he can perform quantum error correction in the usual sense , then he can perform the simulation .",
    "but conversely , it follows from the methods of  @xcite that if he only has two measurements approximating generalized @xmath30 and @xmath31 observables sufficiently well , he can build a quantum error correction procedure @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , a quantum - id code with @xmath32 is itself a quantum error correcting code ; there is no difference between error correction and identification if both tasks are to be performed perfectly .",
    "even the task of transmitting classical information is conveniently reflected in this framework . in that case , bob only wants to simulate the measurement of the generalized @xmath31 observable .    with this , one can define in the usual way a _ quantum - id capacity _",

    "previously it was only known that for the noiseless qubit channel @xmath34 , @xmath35 ,    double the value of both the the quantum and classical transmission capacities  @xcite .",
    "while reasoning directly about quantum identification codes has proved challenging , the duality between geometry preservation and approximate forgetfulness provides a new approach to studying them . up to some technical conditions , geometry preservation is equivalent to the existence of a quantum identification code .",
    "it is therefore possible to construct quantum identification codes by finding approximately forgetful maps .",
    "this approach is fruitful because destroying information is a comparatively indiscriminate task .",
    "indeed , the analogous strategy has led to a number of straightforward proofs of the hashing bound on the quantum capacity of a quantum channel  @xcite .",
    "classical data is not immune to analysis by purification either .",
    "the duality between privacy amplification and data compression with quantum side information has recently led to a proof in this spirit  @xcite of the holevo - schumacher - westmoreland theorem on the classical capacity of a quantum channel  @xcite .    with the fidelity alternative in hand ,",
    "it is even possible to calculate a simple formula for an amortized version of the quantum identification capacity ; it is exactly equal to the entanglement - assisted classical capacity of a quantum channel .",
    "section  [ sec : fidelity.alternative ] contains the formal statement and proof of the fidelity alternative .",
    "the duality is studied in more detail in section  [ sec : qid ] , where forgetfulness is shown to be nearly equivalent to quantum identification . in that section",
    "we provide a simple statement whose proof eliminates many technical difficulties , as well as a more flexible version that we prove from first principles .",
    "section  [ sec : qid.cap ] uses the flexible version of the equivalence to construct quantum identification codes for memoryless quantum channels .",
    "we will restrict our attention throughout to finite dimensional hilbert spaces .",

    "@xcite ( also known as _ diamond norm _",

    "<S> dedicated to the memory of rudolf ahlswede    if a quantum system is subject to noise , it is possible to perform quantum error correction reversing the action of the noise if and only if no information about the system s quantum state leaks to the environment . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we develop an analogous duality in the case that the environment approximately forgets the identity of the quantum state , a weaker condition satisfied by @xmath0-randomizing maps and approximate unitary designs . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that the environment approximately forgets quantum states if and only if the original channel approximately preserves pairwise fidelities of pure inputs , an observation we call the fidelity alternative . using this tool </S>",
    "<S> , we then go on to study the task of using the output of a channel to simulate restricted classes of measurements on a space of input states . </S>",
    "<S> the case of simulating measurements that test whether the input state is an arbitrary pure state is known as equality testing or quantum identification . </S>",
    "<S> we establish that the optimal amortized rate at which quantum states can be identified through a noisy quantum channel is equal to the entanglement - assisted classical capacity of the channel , despite the fact that the task is quantum , not classical , and entanglement - assistance is not allowed . in particular , this rate is strictly positive for every quantum channel , including classical channels , even though the ability to identify can not be cloned . </S>"
