    "this is precisely the two - level system that has been used in this work , with the identification @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",

    "if a fluorescent photon is detected , we deduce the state to be @xmath0 , otherwise the state is @xmath1 . however , this measurement is not perfect due to limited photon detection efficiency - some of the fluorescent photons are lost , while some are not detected due to imperfect detectors .",
    "this imperfect measurement is a major source of errors in nv center magnetometry @xcite , and this is what we now analyze .    to start , recall that the error probability is given by @xmath139 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are orthogonal projectors in our two - dimensional hilbert space .",

    "<S> finally , a major limitation of the measurement process , namely limited photon detection efficiency , is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> our proposals should be implementable with current experimental technology .    _ introduction . _ </S>",
    "<S> the ability to measure weak magnetic fields is an important problem with applications in many different fields like data storage , biomedical sciences , material science and quantum control @xcite . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) defect centers @xcite , due to their small size , impressive magnetic field sensitivity , robustness in a variety of environments , and wide - temperature range operation , have attracted widespread attention in order to reconstruct the temporal profile of an unknown weak magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea behind the use of nv centers to measure magnetic fields is to initially prepare a superposition state of two different energy levels @xcite . in the presence of a magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , a phase difference develops between the energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> this phase difference , which depends on the magnetic field , can then be read out in order to infer the magnetic field .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> our emphasis is somewhat different . </S>",
    "<S> we do not wish to measure the parameters of an unknown magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we want to find out whether or not a magnetic field , about which we have some prior information , is actually present or not . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this problem as the ` detection ' of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily envisage that the ability to answer such a question can be of great use in areas such as data storage and magnetic resonance imaging . </S>",
    "<S> our basic idea is to again prepare the nv center in a superposition state of two energy levels @xmath0 and @xmath1 , defined as @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the pauli matrix @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we prepare the state @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for interaction of the nv center with the magnetic field @xmath6 is @xmath7 with @xmath8 . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , ignoring decoherence , if no magnetic field is present , then after time @xmath9 the state of the nv center is still @xmath10 , while if there is a magnetic field , the state becomes @xmath11 with @xmath12 dependent on the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the question of whether or not there is a magnetic field becomes a problem of discriminating between the two quantum states @xmath10 and @xmath13 @xcite , towards which we now turn .    _ quantum state discrimination . </S>",
    "<S> _ suppose that we are given two states @xmath10 and @xmath13 , with prior probabilities @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , that need to be distinguished by performing a measurement that is described , in general , by a positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the povm elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 are such that if @xmath16 ` clicks ' , we say that the state is @xmath10 and vice versa . in general , </S>",
    "<S> since the two states need not be orthogonal , we have a non - zero error probability @xmath18 that we choose the wrong state if we insist on making a choice between the two states . </S>",
    "<S> the idea then is to construct a povm so as to minimize the error probability @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately for us , this problem has a general solution when we need to discriminate between two states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we first define the hermitian operator @xmath20 living in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we can then find the eigenvalues @xmath22 of @xmath23 , and categorize them as @xmath24 for @xmath25 , @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 , thereby defining @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> it can then be shown that the minimum error probability is given by @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal povm is a projective measurement given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the eigenstates of @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now apply this formalism to our case , but before doing so , we consider the effect of the environment of the nv center on the evolution of the nv center state . </S>",
    "<S> the nv center interacts with a spin bath composed mainly of the surrounding nitrogen defects ( p1 centers ) . </S>",
    "<S> these dipolarly coupled p1 centers lead to dephasing of the nv center and negligible relaxation due to the large energy mismatch between the nv center and the p1 centers . calculating the exact dynamics of the nv center in the presence of p1 centers </S>",
    "<S> is a very challenging problem because the p1 centers also interact amongst themselves . in order to make the problem tractable , </S>",
    "<S> a common approach is to approximate the effect of the p1 centers on the nv centers via a classical gaussian noise field @xmath36 with zero mean and correlation function @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the correlation time and @xmath39 describes the interaction strength between the nv center and the spin bath of the p1 centers . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that such a description of the effect of the environment of the nv center describes experimental results very well @xcite .    since the nv center undergoes only dephasing , it is clear that if there is no magnetic field , the nv center state becomes , after a time @xmath9 , @xmath40 where the factor @xmath41 , which depends on @xmath9 , takes into account the effect of decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , if there is a magnetic field present , the nv center state becomes @xmath42 , where the factor @xmath43 takes into account the evolution of the nv center state induced by the presence of the magnetic field that we are trying to detect . </S>",
    "<S> particular forms of @xmath41 and @xmath43 will be worked out later . </S>",
    "<S> we thus need to discriminate between the states @xmath10 and @xmath13 . assuming that the prior probabilities for the absence and presence of the magnetic field are @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , we find that the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath20 are @xmath44 we can then have three cases . </S>",
    "<S> first , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are both positive . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we need not perform any measurement - we can always say that there is a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this can happen , for instance , if @xmath47 and decoherence is very significant . </S>",
    "<S> second , if @xmath45 and @xmath46 are both negative , we decide that there is no magnetic field . finally , for the case that one eigenvalue is positive , while the other is negative , we find that @xmath48 this is obviously the most interesting case , and the one that we will be concentrating on . in particular , if we have no previous knowledge of whether or not there is a magnetic field , then @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , @xmath50.\\ ] ] to find the optimal measurement , we find the eigenvectors of @xmath23 to obtain @xmath51 and @xmath52 with    @xmath53 where @xmath54    _ dc field detection . </S>",
    "<S> _ as an illustration of our formalism , we start with the problem of detecting dc magnetic fields , that is @xmath55 . in the absence of any control fields to suppress decoherence , we find that @xmath56 where @xmath57 indicates an average over the different noise realizations . </S>",
    "<S> using the properties of the noise field @xmath36 , we find @xmath58 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us also assume that we know @xmath59 perfectly . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we are not sure if there is a magnetic field or not , but if there is a magnetic field present , we know that it is @xmath55 . in this case , @xmath60 , which leads to , assuming @xmath61 , @xmath62.\\ ] ] our objective then is to find @xmath9 such that @xmath19 is minimized . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , this makes sense because for small @xmath9 , the phase difference is too small to discriminate the states , while for large @xmath9 , decoherence is too dominant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an optimal value of @xmath9 needs to be chosen so as to achieve the minimum possible @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding @xmath43 can then be calculated , leading to @xmath63 , and thus @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this task is performed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ firstfigure ] , where we show the detection of magnetic fields of various strengths using noise parameters drawn from recently performed experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dcfielddetection ] that , unfortunately , it is challenging to detect dc magnetic fields of strength @xmath64 and below using nv centers . </S>",
    "<S> however , detection of stronger magnetic fields such as those of strength @xmath65 and above is very much possible . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dcmeasurement ] that the optimum measurement depends on the magnetic field being detected and is not fixed . </S>",
    "<S> this should be contrasted with the situation for the measurement of magnetic fields ( see , for instance , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) where measurements are performed in the basis @xmath66 with @xmath67 .    a more realistic scenario is to consider the situation where we do not know @xmath59 precisely . </S>",
    "<S> rather , @xmath59 is known with some probability distribution that we assume to be @xmath68 in other words , we suspect that there is a magnetic field of strength around @xmath69 and we are trying to find if there is indeed such a magnetic field present or not . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70 while @xmath41 remains the same . once again , we find @xmath9 that minimizes @xmath19 , then the corresponding @xmath43 and thereby @xmath16 and @xmath17 . a plot of @xmath19 against @xmath9 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dcfieldunknownmagnitude ] . comparing with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dcfielddetection ] , one can see that the less precisely we know the magnetic field , the less reliably we can say whether or not a magnetic field is present .    </S>",
    "<S> _ ac field detection . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have seen that using a nv center , it is difficult to detect static magnetic fields of strength @xmath71 and below . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising - dc magnetic fields of a similar magnitude can not be reliably measured using nv centers either . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is decoherence . to eliminate decoherence , </S>",
    "<S> one possible solution is to use dynamical decoupling techniques @xcite , whereby a sequence of rapid control pulses are applied to the nv center . </S>",
    "<S> these pulses effectively keep on flipping the sign of the nv center - spin bath interaction hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if these pulses are applied rapidly enough , the effect of the spin bath is largely eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , for a dc field , the effect of the static field that we are trying to detect is also eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> but for an ac field , the direction of the magnetic field also keeps on changing direction . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical decoupling can then still be used , provided that we apply the pulses at ( or near ) the nodes of the magnetic field so that the phase difference between the nv center states keeps on accumulating . </S>",
    "<S> let us examine this more quantitatively . for @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> , we apply the carr - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg ) pulse sequence , specified by @xmath73^{n/2}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we allow the nv center to evolve freely for time @xmath74 ( denoted by @xmath75 ) , then we apply a control pulse specified by @xmath76 , followed by @xmath77 , then another control pulse , and finally we have @xmath75 again . </S>",
    "<S> this whole cycle is then repeated @xmath78 times , where @xmath79 is the number of pulses applied . to ensure that we apply the pulses at the nodes of the magnetic field , we choose @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> once again assuming that @xmath81 , we find @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the computation for @xmath41 , on the other hand , is considerably more involved . in the presence of the pulses , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , which can assume values @xmath85 or @xmath86 , takes into account the effect of the pulses by switching sign whenever a pulse is applied . </S>",
    "<S> it can then be shown that @xmath87 , with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath41 for any pulse sequence can be calculated , at least numerically . for the cpmg sequence </S>",
    "<S> , it is relatively straightforward , though laborious , to derive the analytic form for @xmath41 which can be found in the supplementary material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using the expressions for @xmath41 and @xmath43 , we find @xmath79 ( or , in other words , @xmath91 ) so as to obtain the smallest possible value of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fielddetectioncp ] . </S>",
    "<S> the key point is that now @xmath41 is much closer to @xmath92 , leading to considerably smaller values of @xmath19 for a field strength of around @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is possible that we also do not know , for instance , the frequency of the magnetic field precisely . in this case , in the computation for @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> , we can include a probability distribution for frequency just like we did for the amplitude of the magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> one can also consider other kinds of oscillating magnetic fields .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider @xmath93 , with @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the control pulses are again applied at the nodes of the magnetic field , and @xmath95 ( assuming that the field is perfectly known ) and @xmath41 can be determined numerically . </S>",
    "<S> results are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bichromatic ] , showing that by suitably choosing @xmath9 we can detect more complicated fields reliably as well .    </S>",
    "<S> _ using multiple copies . </S>",
    "<S> _ the error probabilities we have found until now utilize only one copy of the nv center . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , multiple copies of the nv center , which are also used when we are measuring a magnetic field , can be used to reduce the error probability @xmath19 even further @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us define @xmath96 $ ] and @xmath97 $ ] as the conditional error probabilities . then </S>",
    "<S> , with @xmath98 fixed local measurements on @xmath98 copies , the total error probability is @xmath99 for @xmath98 odd , while if @xmath98 is even , then @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ multiplemeasurements ] shows clearly how , by using multiple nv centers ( or using the same nv center repeatedly ) , we can very reliably detect the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be noted that we are performing the same measurement again and again . </S>",
    "<S> even better results could be obtained if we keep on updating the measurement that should be performed @xcite , which is the subject of a future work .    _ </S>",
    "<S> imperfect photon detection efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> _ finally , before concluding , we explain how the optimum measurement ( specified by @xmath63 ) can be performed . </S>",
    "<S> measurement in the basis @xmath101 can not be performed directly . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we can use spin - dependent fluorescence to perform measurements in the basis @xmath102 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to effectively measure in the @xmath101 basis , we need to first apply a rotation operator @xmath103 to the nv center state . labeling the @xmath4 eigenvalues as @xmath104 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that @xmath105 = \\text{tr}[\\rho { \\left| \\phi_+\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle \\phi_+\\right|}]$ ] and @xmath106 = \\text{tr}[\\rho { \\left| \\phi_-\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle \\phi_-\\right|}]$ ] , where @xmath107 is the nv center state . </S>",
    "<S> for the optimum measurement found before , @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this measurement is not perfect since the fluorescent photons can not be captured with @xmath109 efficiency , and this is a major source of error in nv center magnetometry @xcite . in order to model the imperfect detection , we introduce the conditional probabilities @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 means no photon detected , while @xmath115 means at least one photon detected . in particular , @xmath116 implies perfect measurement , while @xmath117 implies a totally imperfect measurement . by using this simple model </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to deduce ( see the supplementary material @xcite for details ) that @xmath118.\\ ] ] moreover , we can also show that @xmath119 does not change the measurement that should be performed @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ finiteefficiency ] , we have plotted the error probability as a function of @xmath120 , showing that we do not need perfect measurement to detect magnetic fields . of course , by using multiple copies of the nv center , this error probability can be reduced further .    </S>",
