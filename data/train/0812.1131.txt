    "many interesting phenomena were discovered from the interplay between local moment magnetism and superconductivity in rrh@xmath7b@xmath7 and rni@xmath0b@xmath0c @xcite .",
    "a unique situation was found in honi@xmath0b@xmath0c where a double reentrance is observed in a narrow range of temperature interval which was attributed to the development of a c - axis modulation leading to a ferromagnetic component thus causing superconductivity to weaken / disappear @xcite . in this paper",
    "our primary concern is to ascertain the magnetic state of eu - moments and how they affect the superconductivity in this compound .",

    "small intensity line at 1.1 mm / s represents trivalent eu and this might be due to formation of small amount of trivalent impurity phase during the powdering process for preparing the absorber or during the sample preparation .",

    "this value of hyperfine field is substantially smaller ( nearly half ) than that for eufe@xmath0as@xmath15 ( b@xmath16 = 26 tesla ) which is due to doping of 50% europium with non magnetic potassium @xcite .",

    "we see a single unsplit line with a width of 0.32 mm / s confirming absence of un - reacted iron in the sample .",
    "the line width does not show any change at 180 k or at lower temperature down to 20 k suggesting absence of sdw transition which was present in the parent compound eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 at 190 k. only below 15 k we see a marginal increase of line width ( 0.5 mm / s at 4.2k ) due to transferred field from eu - ordering .",
    "to summarize our combined investigation of the magnetic susceptibility , electrical resistivity and mssbauer spectroscopy clearly establish coexistence of eu short range magnetic order and superconductivity in eu@xmath8k@xmath8fe@xmath0as@xmath0 sample .",
    "superconductivity in this sample occurs below 33 k and magnetic order due to eu - moments occurs below 13 k. the features of magnetic susceptibility in the temperature range 5 - 15 k is similar to that found in honi@xmath0b@xmath0c which was attributed to the intense competition between ho - magnetic order and superconductivity .",
