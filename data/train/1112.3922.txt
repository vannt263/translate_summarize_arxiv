    "the small hole effects have been generalized @xcite , and noise effects have also been considered @xcite ; for reviews see refs .. this work begs the question : how do transport processes such as diffusion depend upon the position and size of a hole ?",
    "we answer this question for the diffusion coefficient of an extended dynamical system , interpreting the holes now as the links between spatially separate regions of phase space .",

    "chaotic diffusion provides a setting where the interaction between different holes can be studied , an area that has yielded interesting results regarding escape rates from circular @xcite and diamond @xcite billiards with two holes , and very recently regarding transmission and reflection rates in stadium billiards @xcite and the bouncer model @xcite .",
    "a general relation between escape and diffusion has been established by the escape rate theory of chaotic diffusion , which provides exact formulas expressing transport coefficients in terms of escape rates in spatially extended systems with absorbing boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "much research has gone into studying the parameter dependence of the diffusion coefficient in simple one - dimensional maps @xcite . for low - dimensional ,",
    "spatially periodic chaotic dynamical systems the diffusion coefficient is often found to be a fractal function of control parameters , exhibiting non - trivial fine scale structure even in apparently simple examples @xcite .",
    "the source of this fractality is typically explained in terms of topological instability under parameter variation of the underlying dynamics @xcite .",
    "however there exist systems that display these hallmarks of fractality but nevertheless have a linear diffusion coefficient @xcite . therefore there is still work to be done explaining the phenomenon of fractal diffusion coefficients in one dimension , let alone attempting to answer questions about higher dimensional , more physical systems like sawtooth maps @xcite , standard maps @xcite or particle billiards @xcite where analytical results are lacking , as are answers to basic questions about the structure of the diffusion coefficient .",

    "the main aim of this paper is to see how the diffusion coefficient varies with the size and position of a hole in a paradigmatic ` toy model ' . in the process",
    "we find new relations between diffusion and escape rates , between diffusion and periodic orbits , and we extend the small hole theory of refs .",

    "what we learn here can hopefully be transferred to more physically realistic dynamical systems such as particle billiards @xcite .    in sec.[sec : sys ] we define the dynamical system that will be the main object of our study .",
    "it is a simple piecewise - linear chaotic map of the real line which is a deterministic realization of a random walk .",
    "it is constructed by copying and periodically lifting the ` bernoulli shift ' or ` doubling map modulo one ' over the whole real line @xcite . modeling a coin tossing process in terms of deterministic chaos ,",
    "the doubling map modulo one is one of the simplest dynamical systems displaying stochastic - like properties making it an indispensable tool for studying statistical mechanics in the setting of dynamical systems @xcite .",

    "however we do not introduce diffusion into the system through variation of a control parameter such as a shift or by varying the slope .",
    "rather we ` dig holes ' into the map that serve as intervals where points can be iterated to a neighboring interval in analogy with the work in ref ..",

    "we explain this result in terms of the complicated forward and back scattering rules associated with even simple dynamical systems @xcite .    by using the same approach ,",
    "similar results are obtained for the diffusion coefficient of maps where the holes are not placed symmetrically , and where the map generating the microscopic dynamics is non - symmetric . following this",
    ", we consider the case of small hole size by deriving analytical expressions for the diffusion coefficient which capture the asymptotic regime .",

    "the points @xmath47 will then be pre - images of @xmath51 under the map @xmath1 .",

    "there are @xmath55 places to position an interval @xmath13 of size @xmath56 , with @xmath14 being determined by the symmetry condition .",
    "we can evaluate the diffusion coefficient at each of these choices via eq.([eq : d2 ] ) and compare the results as the choices vary .",
    "for example , when @xmath57 there is only one choice for @xmath13 , namely @xmath58 , exactly corresponding to a simple random walk , with @xmath51 probability of moving left or right at each step .",
    "the diffusion coefficient for this system is well known to be @xmath51 , in agreement with the more general expressions given here , eq.([eq : drw ] ) for @xmath59 and eq.([eq : d2 ] ) , as @xmath60 for higher values of @xmath54 the diffusion coefficient varies with the position of the holes , see fig .",
    "[ fig:6d ] .",
    "we see a step function that behaves increasingly erratically as the partition is refined and @xmath54 is increased .",
    "we further note that the average of this step function can be calculated to be @xmath61 for a given @xmath54 , which is the simple random walk solution of eq.([eq : drw ] ) .",
    "the structure of the step functions in fig .  [ fig:6d ] can be explained in terms of the periodic orbits of the map @xmath1 which correspond to _ standing _ or _ running _ orbits of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "for example , if an image of @xmath13 overlaps @xmath14 , one will find a lot of backscattering in the system , i.e. , points that escape the unit interval via @xmath13 find themselves getting sent back via @xmath14 ( and vice versa ) .",
    "this has the result of decreasing the diffusion coefficient relative to the random walk solution derived in eq.([eq : drw ] ) . in order to find intervals where this overlap occurs",

    "the smaller values of @xmath66 will correspond to values of @xmath67 which give the most overlap and hence the most backscattering .",

    "@xmath68,\\ \\ \\rightarrow x = \\frac{1}{3}. \\label{eq : dmin}\\ ] ] therefore if one places @xmath13 so that @xmath69 is in its interior , one will find the system has a relatively small diffusion coefficient due to the backscattering .",
    "this phenomenon caused by _ standing _",
    "orbits @xcite is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig:6d ] .    alternatively ,",
    "if the image of @xmath13 overlaps with itself consistently then one will find a higher diffusion coefficient .",
    "this is due to the presence of _ running _ orbits or accelerator modes @xcite in such a system . in order to find such orbits , we solve the simple equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 for @xmath64 .",
    "for example @xmath72 gives @xmath73,\\ \\",

    "[ fig:6d ] that when the hole contains the point @xmath74 one has a high diffusion coefficient relative to the simple random walk result .",
    "when @xmath75 , @xmath76 we can immediately throw the solution @xmath69 away as this result corresponds to @xmath77 . however , for @xmath78 @xmath79 and again we see in fig .",
    "[ fig:6d ] that these values correspond to relatively high diffusion coefficients when they are in the interior of @xmath13 .",
    "this process of pinpointing standing and running periodic orbits can be continued for higher iterations with relative ease as we are dealing with a full shift map and there is no need to prune any solutions .",
    "this technique helps explain the increasingly complicated step function that one obtains as @xmath54 is increased .    at first sight , the step functions illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:6d ] do not appear to contain much interesting structure .",
    "however , upon closer inspection we notice that every ` parent ' hole of size @xmath56 and associated diffusion coefficient @xmath80 splits into two ` child ' holes of size @xmath81 and associated diffusion coefficients @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively , such that @xmath84 where superscripts @xmath85 correspond to left and right child hole respectively . to see this ,",
    "one first needs to define cumulative functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the respective left and right child holes .",
    "now since the cumulative functions are additive with respect to the holes we have that @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , since the iterate of the parent hole endpoint @xmath90 always avoids both parent and child holes then @xmath91 . finally , considering the midpoint @xmath92 of the parent hole which is also the right and left endpoint of the left and right child holes respectively , it follows from eq.([eq : tfull ] ) that @xmath93 .",
    "eq.([eq : parent ] ) follows after expanding in terms of @xmath94 and @xmath95 and substituting the above relations .",
    "notice that recursive iteration of eq.([eq : parent ] ) @xmath22 times gives an expression for @xmath80 in terms of the @xmath96 child diffusion coefficients @xmath97 where the sum runs over all @xmath96 binary permutations of length @xmath22 . rearranging this we find @xmath98 that is , the relative deviation of each diffusion coefficient from its mean is exactly additive .        the above scaling and self - similarity structure ( often considered to be properties of fractal structures ) of the step functions illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:6d ] can be further investigated by defining a set of continuous , cumulative functions which integrate over the step function , in the same way that @xmath38 integrates over the step function @xmath36 . in order to define such a function , @xmath99 , for a given @xmath54",
    ", we firstly subtract the average diffusion coefficient @xmath100 , and integrate over the resulting step function .",
    "we then normalize this integral by multiplying it with @xmath101 so that it can be easily compared with other values of @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath102 where @xmath103 refers to the diffusion coefficient of the dyadic interval @xmath13 containing @xmath104 .",
    "the solution to eq.([eq : cumul ] ) is illustrated for several examples of @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumul ] .",
    "we see that as @xmath54 increases , eq.([eq : cumul ] ) becomes a fractal function exhibiting non - trivial fine scale structure and regions of scaling and self - similarity .",
    "this structure is symptomatic of the dense set of periodic orbits which exists in @xmath1 . in the limit of @xmath54 going to infinity",
    ", each periodic orbit makes the diffusion coefficient deviate from the average hence one obtains a dense step function .",
    "when this function is integrated over one sees a function that contains a dense set of maxima and minima , hence a fractal .",
    "another interesting feature that we find in this system is that reducing the size of the holes can sometimes have no effect on the diffusion coefficient . as we calculated in eq.([eq : d_ex ] ) , if the holes are @xmath105 $ ] and @xmath106 $ ] , the diffusion coefficient is equal to @xmath107 .",
    "however , we can reduce the hole so that @xmath108 $ ] and @xmath109 $ ] and the diffusion coefficient remains equal to @xmath107 as illustrated in fig .",

    "we also see that if the holes are @xmath110 $ ] and @xmath111 $ ] , the diffusion coefficient is equal to @xmath112 .",
    "this is due to a simple trapping mechanism in which no diffusion occurs . in addition , reducing the size of the holes can result in an increase of the diffusion coefficient , i.e. , the diffusion coefficient decreases non - monotonically in some regions as the size of the holes is decreased .",
    "one can check this by comparing the figures in fig .",
    "[ fig:6d ] .",
    "this feature is due to the fact that increasing the size of the hole can in some cases introduce more backscattering into the system thereby reducing the diffusion coefficient : consider the case where @xmath113 $ ] with diffusion coefficient equal to @xmath114 , fig .",
    "[ fig:6d].(b ) , and compare with the case with smaller holes , @xmath115 $ ] but larger diffusion coefficient @xmath116 , fig .",
    "[ fig:6d].(c ) .",
    "the dominant periodic orbit ( the one with the lowest period ) in the interval @xmath117 $ ] is the orbit of the point @xmath118 which corresponds to a running orbit as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:6d].(f ) .",
    "the dominant periodic orbit in @xmath119 $ ] meanwhile is the orbit of the point @xmath120 which corresponds to a standing orbit as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:6d].(f ) .",
    "the effect of decreasing the hole from @xmath121 $ ] to @xmath122 $ ] is to remove the standing orbit of @xmath120 and the backscattering associated with it .",
    "one can also observe this phenomenon by looking at the fractal structure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymp].(b ) . while @xmath123 is fixed ,",
    "the various maxima and minima that we see can be explained by looking at the orbit of the point @xmath124 .",
    "we see that when @xmath125 ( corresponding to @xmath126 ) , the orbit of @xmath124 is a standing orbit and hence we see a striking minimum in the diffusion coefficient . if we reduce @xmath127 so that @xmath128 with @xmath129 , the orbit of @xmath124 is now a running orbit and we observe a maximum in the diffusion coefficient .",

    "[ fig : asymp].(b ) .",
    "this explanation in terms of topological instability under parameter variation is discussed further in refs ..         +     +    one can also consider the case where the holes are not placed symmetrically .",
    "one way of doing this is by setting @xmath130 in eq.([eq : bern_lift ] ) and letting @xmath14 vary independently such that @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "as before we assume markov holes , i.e. @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "the cumulative function in this setting is given by @xmath135 where the superscript @xmath136 refers to the non - symmetrically placed holes .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is then given by @xmath137 cf .",

    "[ fig : tentmap].(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , in which the analytical eq.([eq : diff_ns ] ) is evaluated for @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively and illustrated as a function of the position of @xmath14 .",
    "we see that the step function structure is changed relative to fig .",
    "[ fig:6d].(c ) , ( d ) and ( f ) .",
    "in particular , in fig .  [",
    "fig : tentmap].(c ) we observe a very evenly distributed set of minima , these being the dyadic rationals which are in this case all the preimages of @xmath74 in @xmath13 and hence indicative of increased backscattering .",
    "in addition , the average value for the diffusion coefficient is @xmath140 rather than @xmath127 due to the constant presence of the running orbit at @xmath74 .",
    "this follows from noticing that @xmath141 , where @xmath142 corresponds to a cumulative function defined by @xmath133 with @xmath134 . here",

    "eq.([eq : poexp ] ) suggests that the observed fluctuations of @xmath80 from its average @xmath185 are due to the individual fluctuations of the infinitely many periodic orbits which intersect the holes .",
    "as expected from periodic orbit theory @xcite , a very large number of periodic orbits is needed to trace the hole accurately . however , if the periodic orbits are ordered appropriately the sum may be truncated to produce good approximations to @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "note that the optimal ordering ( for fast convergence ) of periodic orbits is by a modified version of the length of the orbit ; @xmath186 for @xmath187 .",
    "in other words backscattering is much more dominant for orbits of equal period ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : asymp ] ) .",
    "we can further study the asymptotic behavior for the three different cases derived above and the finite hole size result by reducing @xmath13 continuously .",
    "[ fig : asymp](a ) illustrates these different regimes .",
    "when using eq.([eq : dcomb ] ) , care needs to be taken when @xmath13 converges to a point from the left or the right , i.e. , it is not centered on a point and reduced in size . in this case a boundary point of the hole , @xmath188 or @xmath124 , is kept fixed .",
    "if the boundary point is periodic , points near it in the interior of @xmath13 miss @xmath14 , and so it is always a running orbit .",
    "for example , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:6d ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : asymp].(a ) , @xmath69 is a period two standing orbit when @xmath189 is in the interior of @xmath13 and the asymptotic regime for small @xmath127 when @xmath13 converges to @xmath189 is given by eq.([eq : dlimitbs ] ) as @xmath190 .",
    "however , if @xmath123 is fixed and @xmath127 goes to zero , we must use eq.([eq : dlimitnbs ] ) to evaluate the asymptotic regime as in this case @xmath189 is a running orbit .",
    "eq.([eq : dlimitnbs ] ) tells us that the asymptotic regime is in fact @xmath191 .",
    "this additional topological subtlety that must be considered is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymp].(b ) .",
    "we close this subsection by considering small hole approximations to the non - symmetric models considered in sec.[subsec : other ] . in analogy to eq.([eq :",
    "dcomb ] ) for the doubling map with non - symmetric holes as in eq.([eq : tfull_nonsymm ] ) and ( [ eq : diff_ns ] ) , we find through similar arguments that @xmath192 if @xmath193 is converging onto a running periodic orbit of period @xmath66 ( since @xmath194 as @xmath195 ) .",
    "in contrast with the symmetric holes , here all backscattering is due to dyadic rationals . this is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : tentmap ] .",
    "hence , we find @xmath196 if @xmath193 is converging onto a dyadic rational of the form @xmath197 where @xmath144 is some positive integer .",
    "a non - periodic point gives @xmath198    for the tent map with non - symmetric holes as considered in sec.[subsec : other ] , eqs.([eq : j1 ] ) and ( [ eq : j3 ] ) carry over , while @xmath199 since dyadic rationals need one more forward iteration of the tent map to enter @xmath13 .",
    "finally , the periodic orbit sum of eq.([eq : poexp ] ) modified by a factor of @xmath200 also holds for the non - symmetric models considered here .",
    "it is interesting to note that an analytical relationship between the escape rate of a spatially extended diffusive dynamical system with absorbing regions and its diffusion coefficient has been established by the escape rate theory of diffusion @xcite .",
    "motivated by refs . where the complicated dependence of the escape rate on position and size of a hole has been studied , here we focus on the relationship between the open map @xmath1 on the unit interval with the symmetric holes @xmath13 and @xmath14 serving as absorbing regions and the diffusion coefficient of the corresponding coupled , spatially extended system .",
    "that is , for calculating the escape rate any orbit that enters either of these intervals is removed from the system , and in this way points from an initial density escape , while for calculating the diffusion coefficient all points remain within the system by performing ` jumps ' when hitting these intervals , as defined by the lift eq.([eq : lift ] ) .",
    "an interesting question is to which extent the coupled diffusive ` jump dynamics ' of the spatially extended system is already captured by the escape rate of the interval map that defines the unit cell of this lattice .",
    "the main result from ref .",
    "concerning the escape rate is that escape will occur fastest through a hole whose minimal period is highest , or equivalently , the escape rate will be slowest through the hole which has the smallest minimal period . by minimal period",
    "we mean the smallest period of all the periodic points in a hole .    .",
    "the thin horizontal lines illustrate the average value to aid visual comparison of the fluctuations : @xmath201 and @xmath202 ( 3s.f . )",
    "there is a clear relationship between the structure of these functions although intervals which give relatively high diffusion coefficients will give relatively low escape rates .",
    "the calculation has been performed for intervals @xmath13 of size @xmath204.,width=321 ]    in order to calculate the escape rate of our system we look at the transition matrix induced by the dynamics .",
    "the escape rate @xmath205 can be evaluated via the largest eigenvalue @xmath206 of this transfer matrix @xcite @xmath207 in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_e_comp ] solutions to eq.([eq : esc_rate ] ) are illustrated for @xmath208 and compared with the diffusion coefficient in the corresponding extended system .",
    "here we see that similar structures arise with deviations from the average occurring for both phenomena on the same intervals . in order to quantify these deviations we can compare eq.([eq : dcomb ] ) with theorem @xmath209 from ref . , which generalized to theorem @xmath210 from ref .. it gives the escape rate for small hole size in the doubling map with one hole and can easily be generalized to escape through two holes as is the case here .",
    "this theorem states that the escape rate for small @xmath127 with a running orbit ( no iterate of the orbit reaches the second hole ) is given by @xmath211 where @xmath167 is the lowest period point in the hole with period @xmath66 . for a standing orbit ( the periodic orbit is in both holes )",
    "the period is effectively halved and we get @xmath212 when the hole converges to a non - periodic point , the theorem states that the escape rate is given by @xmath213 from eq.([eq : escp ] ) the relative deviation from the average escape rate @xmath214 is given by @xmath215 for a running orbit and @xmath216 for a standing orbit .",
    "similarly , the relative deviation from the average diffusion coefficient @xmath217 , for a running orbit , can be obtained from eq.([eq : dlimitnbs ] ) as @xmath218 whilst for standing orbits , via eq.([eq : dlimitbs ] ) , the relative deviation is given by @xmath219 eqs.([eq : dev_esc_run ] ) , ( [ eq : dev_esc_sta ] ) , ( [ eq : dev_dnbs ] ) and ( [ eq : dev_dbs ] ) help us explore the relationship between the diffusion coefficient of the extended system with the escape rate of the open system .",
    "an obvious difference is the absence of backscattering in the escape rate .",
    "however a more striking one is that the average escape rate does not equal the algebraic mean of all escape rates as for diffusion coefficients .",
    "that is @xmath220 which is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : d_e_comp ] but is also suggested by eq.([eq : escp ] ) .",
    "the two symmetric holes are coupled differently for the escape problem and in a much more complicated way than as in eq.([eq : parent ] ) by involving the eigenvalues of @xmath221 transfer matrices . however , for small holes this coupling decays rapidly revealing the similarities which are seen in fig .  [ fig : d_e_comp ] .",
    "we remark that while for non - symmetric holes as the ones considered in sec.[subsec : other ] the diffusion coefficients may display qualitative differences ( e.g. no position dependence ) , the corresponding escape rates differ only quantitatively .",
    "the aim of this paper was to study the ` dependence of chaotic diffusion on the size and position of holes ' .",
    "the answer was provided by analytically deriving the diffusion coefficient for both a symmetric and a non - symmetric one - dimensional piecewise linear map as a function of the size and position of a hole .",
    "we showed that for both maps the diffusion coefficient is a complicated function of the position and a non - monotonic function of the size of the holes , despite the fact that the underlying reduced dynamics is not changed , as is the case in previously studied models @xcite .",
    "this finding implies that , surprisingly , making a hole smaller can increase the diffusion coefficient .",
    "these results we explained via the periodic orbit structure of the map and the ideas of running and standing periodic orbits .",
    "we furthermore found that the asymptotic regime that one obtains for small hole size is a function of the type of periodic orbit that the holes converge to .",
    "this is another important result , since it generalizes the standard uncorrelated random walk approximation of simple stochastic processes .",
    "it implies that this random walk approximation may not always give accurate estimates for the diffusion coefficient of a chaotic dynamical system .",
    "we have also obtained a new expansion for the diffusion coefficient of finite size holes in terms of periodic orbits and discussed their relative importance for the dynamics . in our setting",
    ", a periodic orbit can either be a running or a standing orbit .",
    "the presence of a standing orbit has the effect of reducing the diffusion coefficient relative to the average value whilst the presence of a running orbit has the effect of increasing it relative to the average value .",
    "we finally numerically calculated the escape rate of the corresponding open system and compared it with the diffusion coefficient thus relating diffusion and escape in a new manner .",
    "we found that the diffusion coefficient and escape rate are both dependent upon the underlying periodic orbit structure of the map , although differences arise which we explain as a difference in the coupling between holes .",
    "an interesting open question is whether there exists a parent - child scaling relation for the escape rate that is similar to the scaling relation for the diffusion coefficients eqs.([eq : parent],[eq : parent22 ] ) .",
    "another interesting open question is to which extent the above effects can be observed in computer simulations of diffusion in higher dimensional , more physically realistic systems such as suitably adapted periodic lorentz gases @xcite and related particle billiards @xcite",
    ". this should pave the way to design experiments where these effects might be observable , such as modified cold atom experiments on atom - optics billiards @xcite ."
