    ", one can follow the evolution of certain properties of the tree that are of interest .",
    "one such property is the time back to the most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) of the population .",
    "this evolution can be described by a process @xmath9 , where @xmath10 note that @xmath11 is the height of the tree @xmath8 .",
    "the process @xmath9 increases linearly at speed one between jumps , and jumps downward when one of the two oldest families in the population dies out , causing a new mrca to be established .",
    "one can also consider the process @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the sum of the lengths of all branches in the tree @xmath8 .",
    "this process is of interest because , assuming that mutations occur at a constant rate @xmath14 along each branch of the coalescent tree , @xmath13 should be roughly proportional to the number of distinct mutations observed in the population at time @xmath1 .    a natural population model to consider is the moran model @xcite . in this model , the population size stays fixed at @xmath0 .",
    "changes in the population occur at times of a homogeneous poisson process , and we will scale time so that these changes occur at rate @xmath15 . at the time of each such change , one of the @xmath0 individuals is chosen at random to give birth to a new offspring , and independently one of the other @xmath16 individuals",
    "is chosen at random to be killed .",
    "for any fixed @xmath17 , the genealogy of the population follows kingman s coalescent @xcite , meaning that each pair of lineages merges at rate one and no other transitions are possible .",
    "an analogous construction for infinite populations can be carried out using the lookdown construction of donnelly and kurtz @xcite .",
    "the associated evolving coalescent was studied by pfaffelhuber and wakolbinger @xcite .",
    "they showed that the jumps of the process @xmath18 that follows the time back to the mrca occur at times of a homogeneous poisson process , but that the process @xmath18 is not markov .",
    "they also calculated the distributions of some other quantities , such as the number of individuals in the population at time @xmath1 that will have descendants in the population when the next mrca is established and the number of individuals in the population that will become the mrca of the population in the future .",
    "delmas , dhersin , and siri - jegousse @xcite extended these results by considering also the distribution of the sizes of the two oldest families at time @xmath1 .",
    "simon and derrida @xcite did some further work related to the evolution of the mrca for populations with genealogies governed by kingman s coalescent , and considered correlations between the time back to the mrca and a measure of genetic diversity .",

    "evans and ralph @xcite studied the dynamics of the time back to the mrca in a population in which a single  immortal particle \" produces offspring at times of a poisson process , and descendants of the offspring eventually die out . in this setting ,",
    "the process @xmath18 is a markov process whose jump rates and stationary distribution can be calculated explicitly .",
    "an example of a process that fits into this framework is the @xmath21-stable continuous - state branching process conditioned on nonextinction with @xmath22 .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to determine the dynamics of the time back to the mrca and the total branch length for populations whose genealogy is given by the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent .",

    "the reason for focusing on the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent is that this coalescent process has arisen in a wide variety of settings .",
