    "an equivalent representation for the glauber dynamics , known as the _ graphical representation _ , is the following : each vertex has a rate @xmath18 poisson clock attached to it .",
    "these poisson clocks are independent of each other .",
    "assume that the clock at @xmath19 rang at time @xmath20 and that just before time @xmath20 the configuration was @xmath6 .",
    "then at time @xmath20 we replace @xmath21 by a random spin @xmath22 chosen according to the gibbs distribution conditional on the rest of the configuration : @xmath23}{\\p[\\sigma'(v ) = j \\mid \\sigma ] } = \\prod_{w : \\",

    ", we describe a connection between the geometry of a graph and the mixing time of glauber dynamics on it .",

    "thus , the notion that the two sides of the phase transition ( high versus low temperatures ) should correspond to polynomial versus super - polynomial mixing times for the associated dynamics , fails for the ising model on trees : here the two sides of the high / intermediate versus low temperature phase transition just correspond to uniformly bounded versus _ unbounded _ inverse spectral gap .",
    "we also exhibit another surprising phenomenon : on infinite regular trees , there is a range of temperatures in which the inverse spectral gap is bounded , even though there are many different gibbs measures .    in section [ sec : general ] of the paper",
