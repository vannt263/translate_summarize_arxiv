    "large progress in synthesis of heavy nuclei done in the last decades raises new demands for a better and better theoretical description of their decay modes .",
    "spontaneous fission and @xmath0-radioactivity are the most important processes of disintegration of heavy nuclei .",
    "alpha decay occurs most often in actinides region , but is also observed in isotopes with @xmath1 .",
    "the first theoretical interpretation of alpha - decay process was given independently by gamow @xcite , gurney and condon @xcite in 1928 year .",
    "emission of alpha particle is treated as quantum - mechanical tunnelling through the nuclear coulomb barrier , where the probability of emission is calculated using one - dimensional wkb approximation .",
    "recently it was proven , that this approximation can be successfully used to evaluate the probability of tunnelling by alpha particle and cluster as well ( see ref .",
    "it was also shown , that within this simple model ( containing only 1 adjustable parameter for even - even nuclei ) one can reproduce alpha decay half - lives of heavy emitters with higher accuracy in comparison with modern ( containing 5 parameters ) version  @xcite of viola - seaborg formula  @xcite .",
    "the observation in 1938 of the neutron induced nuclear fission by hahn and strassmann came rather unexpected @xcite . this new phenomenon was explained within a few weeks by meitner and frisch s who established the most important features of low - energy fission : the energy released in this process is equal almost 200 mev and results from the coulomb repulsion of the fission fragments and the number of neutron emitted per fission event larger than one , what has opened a possibility for a chain reaction @xcite .",
    "one and a half year after hahn and strassmann s discovery , flerov and petrzhak have first observed the spontaneous fission of uranium @xcite . as we have written above ,",
    "gamow had explained the @xmath0-decay and its sometimes rather long half - lives by a quantum tunnelling process of a preformed @xmath0 particle through a coulomb barrier .",
    "so , according to the concepts of meitner and frisch , one could expect spontaneous fission of uranium also from the ground - state , but with a considerably longer half - life than for the @xmath0-decay , because of the larger reduced mass for almost symmetric fission .",
    "the first quantitative estimates of the spontaneous fission probability becomes possible , when the microscopic - macroscopic model of the potential energy of deformed nuclei was developed and the inglis cranking model was implemented to evaluate the inertia corresponding to the fission mode .",
    "of course in time these models give more and more precise reproduction of the spontaneous fission half - lives systematics and the fission mass distributions .",
    "a short critical description of the spontaneous fission theories will be presented in our paper in order to better understand physical background of a simple model for the probability of this decay mode , which we have developed following an old idea of w. j. wiatecki .",
    "namely , in 1955 year he proposed a formula which was able to describe the global systematics of the spontaneous fission half - lives  @xcite .",
    "his simple phenomenological formula , based on correlations between logarithms of observed spontaneous fission half - lives and ground state microscopic corrections , reproduced well the experimental data known at that time .",
    "we are going to show in the following that his idea , combined with the modern version of the liquid drop model ( lsd )  @xcite , allows to obtain satisfactory agreement with the measured up to now spontaneous fission half - lives .",
