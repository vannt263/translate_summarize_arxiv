    "kicked off by the recent observation of the characteristic quantum hall effect in graphene,@xcite the effect of disorder has attracted considerable attention.@xcite a key interest that is specific to the electronic structure of graphene is the chiral ( a - b sub - lattice ) symmetry @xcite and the scattering between two dirac cones that reside at k and k points in k - space . accordingly , the nature of disorder ( i.e. , whether the disorder preserves the chiral symmetry or not ) should be essential in discussing the electronic properties of disordered graphene . a potential disorder breaks the chiral symmetry , whereas a disorder in bonds preserves the symmetry .",
    "the spatial range of disorder is another important factor , since the inter - valley scattering occurs when the disorder is short - ranged while strongly suppressed when long - ranged .    in our previous papers @xcite ,",
    "we have considered the disorder in the hopping energies as a model for a ripple,@xcite which is an intrinsic disorder in graphene .",
    "we have clearly demonstrated that for such a chiral - symmetry preserving disorder , the criticality of the quantum hall transition at the @xmath0 landau level becomes anomalously sensitive to the spatial correlation of disorder : when the spatial range of the bond disorder exceeds a few lattice constant , no broadening of the graphene - specific @xmath0 landau level occurs and the associated step - function like hall transition exhibits an anomalous ( almost fixed - point ) criticality .",
    "this sharply contrasts with the case of potential disorder which degrades the chiral symmetry , where the criticality is similar to the ordinary quantum hall transition.@xcite    now , when one describes the actual graphene with a tight - binding model , the effect of the next - nearest neighbor hopping in the honeycomb lattice is not negligible.@xcite since the next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath1 connects sites in the same sub - lattice , the chiral symmetry of the original the honeycomb lattice is broken , so that one might naively think that the speciality about the @xmath0 landau level associated with the chiral symmetry should be washed away .",
    "it is to be noted , however , that the space group ( i.e. , rotation and reflection symmetries as well as the translation symmetry ) of the honeycomb lattice are preserved , and , indeed , the two dirac cones still exist at @xmath2 and @xmath3 points at an energy shifted from zero.@xcite the existence of the doubled dirac cones has a topological origin .",
    "for instance , they exist even in the presence of a third - neighbor hopping @xmath4 in one of the three directions ( which is equivalent to the @xmath5 flux model ) with @xmath6 as shown in ref . , where the lattice continuously crosses over to the square lattice as @xmath4 is increased .",
    "in such a system , the dirac cones are located at general points away from k and k in the brillouin zone .",
    "if we add @xmath1 in this case , tilted dirac cones appear at a non - zero energy .",
    "the tilted dirac cones are interesting , since they have been observed in an organic system @xmath7-(bedt - ttf)@xmath8i@xmath9 under a high pressure.@xcite    given these variety of situations , we want to clarify in the present paper whether the anomalous criticality is preserved or washed out .",
    "first , we shall clarify the question : do we have to discriminate the presence or otherwise of the chiral symmetry in the underlying honeycomb lattice ( before we turn on the disorder ) and the presence or otherwise of the chiral symmetry in the disorder ? in order to study these , we adopt the honeycomb lattice model rather than the effective dirac model , since the chiral symmetry has to do with the ab sublattices . to examine the robustness of the criticality for the @xmath0 landau level ,",
    "we calculate the hall conductivity in the honeycomb lattice as well as the @xmath5 flux model with the bond disorder to examine the influence of the next - nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "we find that the anomalous criticality at the @xmath0 landau level for the long - ranged bond disorder is robust against the inclusion of the uniform next - nearest neighbor hopping , namely the break down of the chiral symmetry of the lattice models , which yields , in general , the energy shift as well as the tilt of the dirac cones .",
    "the hall conductivity for non - interacting electron systems is mathematically equivalent to a topological integer called a chern number .",
    "@xcite taking into account the recent progress in numerical evaluation of the chern number , @xcite we adopt a formulation based on the lattice gauge technique to evaluate the hall conductivity in disordered finite systems .",
    "the formulation is based on the topological invariant used in the lattice gauge theory , which can also be understood as a two dimensional generalization of the king - smith - vanderbilt formula for polarization.@xcite the present formulation has been successfully applied to the calculation of the hall conductivity not only for uniform systems but also for disordered systems.@xcite    our second question is : how the criticality appears in the ac ( optical ) hall conductivity , @xmath10 ?",
    "the optical response of qhe system is now attracted growing interest .",
    "for instance , the cyclotron emission from graphene qhe system has been studied theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally with infrared transmission.@xcite specifically , morimoto et al@xcite have shown that the optical hall conductivity @xmath10 has a hall plateau structure even in the ac ( @xmath11 thz ) regime , both in the ordinary two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) and in graphene in the quantum hall regime , although the plateau height is no longer quantized in ac . in graphene",
    "@xmath10 , which reflects the unusual landau level structure , the plateau structure remains against a significant strength of disorder due to an effect of localization . for 2deg",
    "the thz spectroscopy has recently been performed , and a plateau structure of optical hall conductivity has been detected in the thz region.@xcite hence it is interesting to investigate the consequence of the chiral symmetry in the ac hall effect in graphene .",
    "let us begin with the chiral symmetry .",
    "the symmetry is defined by the existence of a local operator @xmath12 with @xmath13 that anti - commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath14 as @xmath15 . for bipartite lattices such as honeycomb and square",
    ", the lattice can be decomposed into @xmath16 and @xmath17 sub - lattices . if we take @xmath18 , the fermion operator @xmath19 is transformed as @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "we can readily show that the lattice model that has only hopping terms @xmath24 connecting a and b sites has the chiral symmetry @xmath25 , irrespective of the details of the hopping terms @xmath26 .",
    "an important consequence of the chiral symmetry is that the energy levels appear in pairs , @xmath27 , and hence the energy spectrum is symmetric around @xmath28 .",
    "assume that @xmath29 is an eigenstate with energy @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 .",
    "then the state @xmath32 is an eigenstate with energy @xmath33 , since @xmath34 . for @xmath28 the eigenstates @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath36 are degenerated .",
    "we can rearrange the eigenstates into @xmath37 to make them simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath12 with @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that the system has an additional symmetry in the zero - energy space . from the definition of @xmath12 ,",
    "it is clear that the eigenstate @xmath39 has its amplitudes only on the @xmath40 sub - lattice sites .",
    "the criticality of the hall transition at @xmath28 can thus be sensitive to the presence or absence of the chiral symmetry.@xcite",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian for the honeycomb lattice with the next - nearest neighbor hopping is given by @xmath41 where the summation is performed for nearest neighbor sites in the first term and for next - nearest neighbor sites in the second term ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath1 are assumed to be real , while the peierls phases , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are determined such that the sum of the phases around a loop is equal to the magnetic flux piercing the loop in units of the flux quantum @xmath44 .",
    "we specify the strength of the uniform magnetic field by the magnetic flux @xmath45 per hexagon in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we introduce a bond randomness in the nearest - neighbor transfer energy as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the uniform and the disordered components , respectively . the disorder in @xmath48",
    "is assumed to have a gaussian distribution @xmath49 with a variance @xmath50 .",
    "the spatial correlation length @xmath51 in the random components is specified by requiring @xmath52 where @xmath53 represents the bond @xmath26 , and @xmath54 the ensemble average@xcite .",
    "the length is hereafter measured in units of the distance @xmath55 between nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "it is to be noted that the hamiltonian @xmath14 is chiral symmetric if @xmath6 even in the presence of disorder in the nearest neighbor hopping @xmath26 , while the chiral symmetry is broken for @xmath56 . in actual graphene",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath1 is estimated to be @xmath57.@xcite     ( solid lines ) and next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath1 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "right : energy dispersion for @xmath58 .",
    "dirac cones are located at @xmath59 and @xmath60 with energy @xmath61.@xcite [ fig1 ] ]      in order to evaluate the hall conductivity , let us consider a @xmath62 system , and impose boundary conditions for the single - particle wave function @xmath63 as @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the single - particle magnetic translation operator in the @xmath66 direction .",
    "the string gauge in the corresponding brick - layer lattice is adopted to treat this twisted boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite when the energy gap exists above the fermi energy @xmath67 , the hall conductivity @xmath68 can related to a topological integer @xmath69 called the chern number as @xcite @xmath70 with @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the wave function of the fermi sea in the twisted boundary conditions specified by the phase @xmath73 with the normalization @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the two - dimensional parameter space for the phase @xmath76 .",

    "the surface integral on @xmath81 is replaced by the line integral by stokes theorem .",
    "it is useful to note that this line integral @xmath83 can be written as @xmath84 with @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",

    "the chern number @xmath90 defined in such a way on the mesh reduces to the chern number @xmath69 defined on the continuum space in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath90 is gauge invariant , and takes an integer value for an arbitrary mesh width @xmath95 .",
    "we have then @xmath96 for a fine enough mesh .",
    "@xcite    in the present case , the wave function of the fermi sea @xmath97 is a slater determinant of the single - particle wave function @xmath63 , so that the link variable @xmath98 for an @xmath99 particle state is given by @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is an @xmath102 matrix .",
    "the elements of @xmath103 are defined by @xmath104 with the @xmath105-th single - particle eigenstate @xmath106 satisfying @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) in the boundary condition specified by @xmath76 , where the fermi energy @xmath67 is assumed to lie between @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the energy gap at the fermi energy is mostly guaranteed for finite and random systems due to the level repulsion .",
    "we thus adopt this formulation to evaluate the chern numbers for each sample . by taking an average over samples in each energy bin ,",
    "we obtain ensemble - averaged hall conductivity as a function of the fermi energy .      the chern number @xmath69 for the case of a bond - disordered honeycomb lattice with @xmath6 , where the chiral symmetry is exactly preserved , is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we can clearly see that the plateau transition in the @xmath0 landau level at @xmath28 becomes almost step - function like as a function of the fermi energy as soon as the spatial correlation length , @xmath51 , of the bond disorder exceeds the lattice constant @xmath55 , as previously shown in ref . . remarkably , this behavior is fixed - point like in that it shows almost no system - size dependence .",
    "the anomalous hall transition is accompanied by the absence of broadening of the @xmath0 landau level .",
    "next we show what happens when we switch on the next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath56 .",
    "note that the dirac cones still exist at @xmath2 and @xmath3 at an energy , @xmath61 , shifted from zero.@xcite the hall conductivity in the case of @xmath111 is shown in fig .",

    "it is clearly seen that the hall plateau transition at the @xmath0 landau level is again anomalously sensitive to the spatial correlation of the bond disorder .",
    "the results for different system sizes are displayed in fig.[fig4 ] , where we see little size - dependence at @xmath0 .",
    "this occurs despite the fact that the chiral symmetry of the lattice model is broken by the next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath112 .",
    "consequently , the energy spectrum is not symmetric about @xmath28 with the @xmath0 landau level shifted from @xmath28 .",
    "if we vary the strength of the next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath1 , the critical energy for the anomalous hall transition associated with the @xmath0 landau level is simply shifted with @xmath1 ( fig.[fig5 ] ) . for @xmath113 landau levels , by contrast , the usual scaling behavior ( i.e. , a narrower transition region for a larger system ) is observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .    the present results amount to that the anomalous transition remains at the energy of the dirac cones , where the breakdown of the usual chiral symmetry does not affect the anomalous criticality although the energy spectrum is affected .",

    "we then compute the optical hall conductivity by using the kubo formula , since the method for calculating the topological ( integer ) chern numbers in the dc case is not applicable to the optical conductivity .",
    "for the ac hall conductivity , we consider the usual honeycomb lattice with different types of disorder to examine how the symmetry of disorder is reflected in the ac conductivity .",

    "the overall structure of the @xmath151 is similar to the random potential case , but we can immediately notice that the @xmath0 step in @xmath151 exhibits an anomalously sharp step structure at even for the optical hall conductivity as in the dc hall conductivity . indeed",

    "the honeycomb lattice calculation , performed here for the optical hall conductivity , is not only more realistic than the effective dirac field description , but also reveals an existence of two regions ( dirac qhe and usual fermionic qhe ) coming from the van hove singularity in the band dispersion , where totally different plateau width and cyclotron resonance structures are observed .",
    "we have investigated , based on several lattice models , the relationship between the chiral symmetry and the anomalous criticality associated with the @xmath155-function like density of states at the @xmath0 landau level in graphene , which yields a step - function like hall plateau transition .",

    ", it has been shown that the anomalous criticality is surprisingly robust against the introduction of the next - nearest neighbor hopping in the honeycomb lattice , which is considered to be appreciable in real graphene .",
    "the anomalous criticality may therefore be realized in a suspended clean graphene where ripples are the major disorder . as for the symmetry ,",
    "the present results implies that the anomalous criticality can be insensitive to the breakdown of the usual chiral symmetry as long as the effective chiral symmetry that produces the massless dirac cones is preserved .",
    "we have also shown that the anomaly is robust against a slight tilt in the dirac cones , which suggests the possibility to observe the anomalous criticality not only in graphene but also in organic materials .",
    "for the ac hall conductivity , we have shown that even for finite frequencies , the transition at the @xmath0 landau level exhibits the anomalous criticality , with the robust plateau structure retained for long - ranged , chiral - symmetric bond disorders . based on these numerical results ,",
    "we conclude that the chiral symmetry manifests itself both in the dc and the ac hall transitions yielding the anomalous criticality at the @xmath0 landau level of graphene .",

    "<S> we investigate numerically whether the chiral symmetry is the sole factor dominating the criticality of the quantum hall transitions in disordered graphene . when the disorder respects the chiral symmetry , the plateau - to - plateau transition at the @xmath0 landau level is shown to become anomalous ( i.e. , step - function - like ) . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , however , the anomaly is robust against the inclusion of the uniform next - nearest neighbor hopping , which degrades the chiral symmetry of the lattice models . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the ac ( optical ) hall conductivity exhibits a robust plateau structure when the disorder respects the chiral symmetry . </S>"
