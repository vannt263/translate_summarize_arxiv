    "the nature and evolutionary state of the majority of these objects were considered controversial .",
    "their luminosity range ( 2.5@xmath5 l / l@xmath64.5 ) indicates that the stars are not very massive , while the location on the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( typically within the main sequence ) suggests that they are not extremely evolved .",
    "the shape of the ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in combination with a lack of a visible nebulosity suggest that circumstellar ( cs ) dust is compactly distributed around the source of radiation .",
    "it has probably been formed recently or is being formed now .    furthermore , the very strong emission - line spectra of fscma type objects are not expected from single stars , because theory predicts relatively weak stellar winds for the above mentioned luminosity range .",

    "the cs matter distribution is a key factor that affects the observed parameters .",
    "strong and fast stellar winds ( e.g. , in ob supergiants ) introduce spectral line emission , but hardly alter the stellar continuum radiation due to a steep outward decrease of the cs gas density . in slowly expanding cs envelopes ( e.g. , keplerian disks of be stars or slow winds of b[e ] supergiants ) the line emission can be even stronger , and the free - free and bound - free radiation can significantly increase the object s brightness in the optical region .",
    "it has been shown that cs disks in be stars can contribute up to @xmath370% to the stellar optical continuum @xcite .",

    "the absorption components of the pcyg profiles are hard to trace , because in most lines they are broad and weak .",
    "other factors that contribute to the problem are moderate signal - to - noise ratios at the continuum level in our data ( typically 20100 ) and complicated variations of the continuum in chelle spectra .",

    "the object s brightness shows no significant variations on a timescale of a few hours .",
    "the @xmath30.06mag fading on 2007 january 23 and a similar brightening on 2006 december 28 may be due to changes in the cs medium , which is also suggested by the spectral line variations ( see section [ spectra ] ) .",

    "no relative variations exceeding 0.02 mag have been detected for this pair of stars .",
    "the light curve was analyzed using the period software time - series analysis package from the starlink software collection .",
    "periods were searched with two different methods : the @xmath19 method and the lomb - scargle periodogram analysis @xcite .",
    "the first method is a straightforward technique , in which the input data are folded on a series of trial periods . at each trial period , the data are fitted with a sinusoid .",
    "the resulting reduced-@xmath19 values are plotted as a function of the trial frequency , and the minima suggest the most likely periods .",
    "this method is ideally suited to study any sinusoidal variations @xcite .",
    "the second method is a novel type of periodogram analysis , quite powerful for finding and testing the significance of weak periodic signals in otherwise random , unevenly sampled data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "false - alarm probabilities ( fap1 ) for the period were computed using a fisher randomization test or a monte - carlo method ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "fap1 represents the fraction of permutations ( i.e. shuffled time - series ) that contained a trough lower than ( in the case of the @xmath19 method ) or a peak higher than ( in the case of the lomb - scargle periodogram analysis ) that of the periodogram of an unrandomized dataset at any frequency .",
    "therefore , this represents a probability that , given the frequency search parameters , no periodic component with this frequency is present in the data . to ensure reliable significance values ,",
    "the minimum number of permutations was set to 1000 .",
    "if a fap1 lies between 0.00 and 0.01 , then the corresponding period is correct with 95% confidence .",
    "periods were searched for within an interval ranging from 0.5 day to 1000 days .",
    "the periodogram is computed at 1000 equally spaced frequencies between 0.001 and 2 .",
    "as these two methods have yielded identical results , we discuss below only results of the lomb - scargle method .",
    "we analyzed each of the long - term datasets separately as well as the combined one .",
    "we found that the maidanak and lho datasets show no significant cycles .",
    "the nsvs data exhibit two cycles , whose durations are @xmath31 day and 250@xmath220 days ( figure [ f7 ] ) .",
    "a careful analysis shows that the shorter cycle is caused by on - off time ratio of observations close to one day .",
    "the 250day cycle can be easily recognized in the left panel of figure [ f5 ] .",
    "unfortunately , the length of the nsvs dataset ( only 237 days ) permits no precise estimate the cycle duration .",
    "for example , @xcite report a 302day cycle for the same nsvs dataset .",
    "an analysis of own photometric data ( lho + maidanak + sro ) obtained in 20042008 as well as of the combined dataset confirms neither of these long - term cycles .",
    "we should note that this might be partially due to a highly unequal time distributions of observations in our datasets ( especially in the lho data ) .",
    "there are only 60 nights with brightness measurements during a total period of 1427 nights .",
    "this leads to a low significance level of the peaks in the power spectrum .",
    "a @xmath14-band light curve of iras00470 + 6429 for the combined dataset folded with the 250day period is shown in figure [ f8 ] .",
    "another cycle that emerges from our data is based on two minima near jd2453200 and jd2454400 ( figure [ f5 ] ) .",
    "this timescale is close to that between the two minima of the he i line radial velocity , which occurred near jd2452900 and jd2454100 ( figure [ f11 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath31200day cycle is probably of cs origin , because we observe no strong radial velocity variations of the li i line , which should trace the motion of a secondary companion ( see the discussion in section [ binary ] ) .",
    "further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring is needed to verify whether the cycle is stable .",
    "the position of in the sky is projected onto a region , occupied by the association .",
    "the association is thought to be located in the perseus spiral arm , but the distance toward it is uncertain .",
    "it contains @xmath340 b - type stars , whose brightness is dimmed by interstellar extinction in a range of a@xmath20 from @xmath32 to @xmath33 mag .",
    "@xcite placed it at 2.5 kpc from the sun by averaging distances , calculated from the luminosity and reddening of individual members .",
    "@xcite adopted a distance of 1.8 kpc , based on the best fit to an intrinsic color - magnitude diagram for the main - sequence b - type stars .",
    "@xcite argued that casob7 is surrounded by an expanding h i shell , whose approaching side is missing due to expansion into interarm space .",
    "these authors studied interstellar gas and dust around the association , and concluded that it is very patchy ; and adopted a distance of 2 kpc for the association .    in order to constrain the distance of iras00470 + 6429 , we collected available photometric and spectroscopic information about projectionally close hot stars and obtained our own high - resolution spectra of six members of casob7 at angular distances of @xmath21 from the object ( see table [ t3 ] ) .",
    "studying our spectra , we found a striking difference in the structure of the interstellar components of the na i d - lines for the stars with very similar spectroscopic distances and reddenings .",
    "some of them ( and bd+63@xmath2287 ) exhibit only one absorption component in each of the d - lines , while the others ( hiltner62 , hd4694 , hd4841 , and bd+63@xmath22102 ) exhibit two components .",
    "the low - velocity component at @xmath23(1118 ) kms@xmath9 originates in the local arm , while the high - velocity one at @xmath23(5866 ) kms@xmath9 most likely forms in the perseus arm within the association .",
    "the absence of the high - velocity component in the spectrum of iras00470 + 6429 in combination with a high reddening and a strength of the diffuse interstellar bands , which is virtually equal to that of hd4694 ( see the lower panel of figure [ f9 ] ) , bd+63@xmath22102 , and bd+63@xmath2287 , suggests that our object is located near the closer edge of both the association and the perseus arm .",
    "the high - velocity interstellar component of the sodium lines in the spectrum of iras00470 + 6429 , if it exists , is weak or blends with the cs absorption components ( see the upper panel of figure [ f9 ] ) .",
    "the position and width of the na i d - line profiles in the spectrum of iras00470 + 6429 are also very close to those of , a supergiant from the association @xcite .",
    "casob14 is located at @xmath24 from casob7 , but casob14 is about half as far from the sun , and its stars are much less reddened than those of casob7 ( see figure [ f10 ] ) . additionally ,",
    "heliocentric radial velocities of the emission components of the metallic lines in the spectrum of iras00470 + 6429 ( @xmath23(4020 ) kms@xmath9 ) are closer to those of members of casob7 ( @xmath23(6035 ) kms@xmath9 ) than to those of members of casob14 ( e.g. , @xmath23(29 ) kms@xmath9 for hd2905 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spectroscopic distances of the casob7 members with one na i d - line component are @xmath30.1 kpc smaller than those of the members with two line components ( see table [ t3 ] ) .",
    "taking into account uncertainties in the distance determination due to using average luminosities for the adopted mk types @xcite , we estimate a distance of 2.0@xmath20.3 kpc toward iras00470 + 6429 , as an initial approximation .",
    "its lower limit is constrained by the distance of the nearest edge of the perseus arm , which is not precisely known .",
    "its upper limit can not exceed distances toward stars with two sodium line components near the object .",
    "the distance toward iras00470 + 6429 is also in agreement with independently derived distance of sh2182 ( see section [ intro ] ) .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of more members of casob7 is needed to put better constraints on the distances .",
    "we also note that the distance of casob7 adopted by @xcite does not appear well - justified , as not all stars in it might have been born at the same time .",
    "this opinion is corroborated by large deviations of spectroscopic distances of individual stars from 1.8 kpc .",
    "our observations of stars near iras00470 + 6429 also revealed that radial velocities of hiltner62 and bd+63@xmath2587 are inconsistent with the galactic rotation for their spectroscopic distances ( see table [ t3 ] ) , probably indicating their binary nature .",
    "based on our spectra , we classify hd4694 as b3 ib and bd+63@xmath22102 as b1 iii instead of b3 ia and b1 ii , respectively , as suggested earlier ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      the average brightness of iras00470 + 6429 ( @xmath26 mag ) and the above distance estimate rule out a high luminosity for the hot star .",
    "the absence of luminosity sensitive photospheric lines , such as si iii 5739   @xcite and si ii 6347 and 6371   @xcite , which are seen in the spectra of supergiants with even stronger line emission , supports this conclusion .",
    "our multicolor photometric data give the following average color - indices in the johnson photometric system : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 mag .",
    "comparison with those of projectionally close b - type stars from casob7 and casob14 shows that iras00470 + 6429 has the strongest reddening .",
    "part of it is definitely due to the cs matter , because even more distant stars of casob7 are bluer than the object ( see figure [ f10 ] ) .",
    "using a relationship between the dib strengths and reddening from @xcite , we estimate the interstellar component of the reddening toward iras00470 + 6429 to be @xmath30 mag . this estimate coincides with that calculated for hd4694 ( @xmath16 = 0.72 mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus supporting the use of the relationship .",
    "the cs component of the reddening depends somewhat on the object s spectral type , which can be constrained from the spectral line content .",
    "the absence of high excitation lines , the weakness of the he i emission lines ( which may be excited by a different source , see section [ gas ] ) , and the average optical color - indices ( assuming that the wavelength dependence of the cs reddening is not very different from that of the interstellar one ) suggest that the star s spectral type is b2b3 . therefore , the cs part of the reddening is @xmath31 mag .",
    "assuming that the overall selective reddening is @xmath32 mag , the total extinction is a@xmath20 = 3.1@xmath33 3.8 mag , the star s effective temperature is t@xmath34 20000 k , and the distance is 2.0@xmath20.3 kpc , one can estimate the star s luminosity to be @xmath0 ( l / l@xmath1 ) = 3.9@xmath20.3 .",
    "this estimate places iras00470 + 6429 in the middle of the luminosity distribution of the fscma group @xcite .",
    "the adopted luminosity is somewhat uncertain , because neither a contribution to the optical continuum from the cs gas nor a possible deviation of the cs reddening law from the interstellar one was taken into account .",
    "this can only be resolved by careful modeling , which will be presented in the next paper of this series .",
    "however , we do not expect the correction to be large , because we still detect photospheric lines ( see section [ spectra ] ) .",
    "they are weak , indicating that the photospheric spectrum is partially veiled by the cs free - free and bound - free continuum radiation .",
    "nevertheless , the observed optical color - indices of iras00470 + 6429 do not noticeably deviate from those expected from a normal b2b3 star affected by interstellar reddening ( see figure [ f10 ] ) .",
    "the presence of pcyg profiles in the spectrum of iras00470 + 6429 is unusual for the fscma star group , the majority of whose members exhibit single- or double - peaked profiles that are typical for disk - like cs gaseous envelopes .",
    "there are only two other objects in the entire group with pcyg type profiles : @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , this type of a line profile does not exclude a disk - like geometry , which is natural in a binary system ( our working hypothesis for explaining properties of fscma stars , * ? ? ? * ) . in this case",
    ", the orbital plane should be viewed nearly edge - on . in combination with narrow photospheric lines , this suggestion favors a low rotational velocity of the primary companion .",
    "pcyg type profiles are observed in various groups of early - type emission - line stars . in supergiants with accelerating stellar winds ,",
    "spectral lines are not very strong because of a fast matter density decrease with distance from the star .",
    "the position of the blue edge of the line absorption component roughly marks the wind terminal velocity . in pre - main - sequence herbig ae /",
    "be stars with more complicated cs envelopes , which include both accretion ( in a disk ) and outflow ( in a wider range of angles ) , the material is thought to have higher velocities near the star ( for a review and an example see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the blue edge of the line may mark the velocity of material that was recently ejected from the stellar surface .",
    "it seems unlikely that the wind of a relatively low - luminosity star , such as iras00470 + 6429 , will accelerate up to the radial velocities of the blue edges of the balmer lines ( in some spectra they reach @xmath3900 kms@xmath9 ) through radiation pressure in spectral lines as in supergiants .",
    "thus , we assume a different mechanism of the cs gaseous envelope formation in the object . following the reasoning of @xcite , iras00470 +",
    "6429 does not seem to be a young star , and one should not expect a protostellar type accretion to be responsible for the formation of the cs disk . on the other hand , the object is probably a binary system ( see section [ binary ] ) , in which the disk forms through mass loss from the hot primary or mass transfer from the secondary .",
    "additional matter ejection in the line of sight , even if the orbital plane deviates from this direction , could account for the observed absorption components of the pcyg line profiles .",
    "the profile shapes vary with time ( see figure [ f11 ] ) .",
    "the position of the emission component in the pcyg type profiles depends on the strength of the absorption component .",
    "however , it seems that the entire spectrum shifts with time .",
    "this is based on the observed differences of the radial velocities of the emission components of fe ii , na i , and balmer lines measured in different spectra .",
    "the differences have the same sign and are close in magnitude .",
    "the shape of the absorption components in the pcyg type profiles is complicated and variable .",
    "this is clearly seen in the strongest lines , such as the balmer lines ( see figure [ f11 ] ) , na i and fe ii ( mult .",
    "these lines have multiple absorption components , whose boundaries ( especially the blue ones ) are very sharp .",
    "in particular , strong absorption components in the spectrum of 2005 november 11 are almost rectangular .",
    "their depth is nearly the same in the range of radial velocities from @xmath23200 to @xmath23100 kms@xmath9 in the fe ii ( mult .",
    "42 ) lines and from @xmath23250 to @xmath2390 kms@xmath9 in h@xmath35 and h@xmath12 .",
    "our spectra obtained in 2005 november with the 6-m telescope of sao ras show that the profile shape varies noticeably in just a few days .",
    "this is detected in the fe ii 5316   and 5363 lines .",
    "the line intensities did not change between 11 and 14 november , but their emission peaks shifted by + 8 kms@xmath9 , while the deepest depressions in their absorption components got shifted by @xmath2320 kms@xmath9 . on the other hand , in our short series of three spectra taken at san pedro martir in 2006 december 2006 and 2007 november ( which also have a lower resolution ) such shifts are within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "one of the most interesting findings from our spectroscopic data is the relative behavior of the he i 5876   and 6678 emission lines compared to the other observed emission lines .",
    "first , the he i lines show pure emission profiles that are broader than the emission components of the balmer and fe ii lines .",
    "second , their average radial velocity is @xmath36 kms@xmath9 versus @xmath37 kms@xmath9 for the emission components of the balmer lines and @xmath38 kms@xmath9 for those of the fe ii lines .",
    "a similar phenomenon was found in several other fscma type objects , such as mwc657 @xcite and as160 @xcite . finally , they appear to exhibit a long - term ( @xmath3 1200 days ) , probably cyclic , variation ( figure [ f12 ] ) .",
    "he i lines usually form near the base of the stellar wind , and the observed variations may be due to those of the mass loss .",
    "this process is also reflected in the variable cs components of the h@xmath7 and na i lines ( see figure [ f11 ] ) .",
    "the strong ir excess observed in iras00470 + 6429 , whose sed shown in figure [ f13 ] is definitely due to cs dust emission .",
    "it is clearly seen that the _ iras _ data obtained through large apertures ( 1@xmath39 ) deviate from those of bass and _ msx_. the _ iras _ data include a contribution from the entire h ii region and perhaps additional emission from interstellar ir cirrus at @xmath40 = 60 @xmath11 m ( see section [ evolution ] ) .",
    "the sed does not show any noticeable silicate feature at @xmath41 m .",
    "this might be due to a large average grain size , the absence of silicates in the cs dust , or a large optical depth . at this point",
    ", it is unclear which of these explanations is correct .",
    "it seems unlikely that the grains are large , because the entire evolutionary phase of fscma objects does not seem to last long .",
    "otherwise , we would observe many more such objects , because they populate a large region of the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "the dust chemical composition is still uncertain .",
    "our observations of fscma objects with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) of the _ spitzer space telescope _ show that a significant fraction of them exhibit weak silicate emission features @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , iras00470 + 6429 was not observed in this program because of the presence of a bright nearby ir source .",
    "however , our bass spectrum seems to rule out silicate dust with a low optical depth , which would produce a strong emission at @xmath42 m .",
    "let us consider the nature and evolutionary state of iras00470 + 6429 in more detail . as mentioned in section",
    "[ intro ] , the object has only been suggested to be a ppn candidate @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed general differences between the fscma objects and post - agb stars . here",
    "we attempt a deeper analysis for iras00470 + 6429 .",
    "@xcite were the first to select the object as a ppn candidate , but they have not justified their choice",
    ". it might be due to the 100@xmath11 m iras flux ( @xmath43 jy , * ? ? ? * ) , which is stronger than those at 12 , 25 , and 60 @xmath11 m .",
    "however , as iras00470 + 6429 is located near the galactic plane ( @xmath44 ) , its ir fluxes may be affected by the interstellar dust emission ( ir cirrus ) and contaminated by emission from projectionally close sources .",
    "co - addition of all iras scans through the source position ( the scanpi procedure , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that the spatially wide 100@xmath11 m iras band at least partially include two optically brighter nearby late - type stars ; at 2@xmath18 and at 4@xmath18 from the iras00470 + 6429 .",
    "another contribution may come from the h ii region sh2182 , which is considered to be illuminated by the object @xcite .",
    "finally , the surface brightness of the sky region , which surrounds iras00470 + 6429 , at @xmath45 m is high enough for the ir cirrus emission to be important .",
    "it is represented by the _",
    "parameter in the iras point source catalog .",
    "it is of the order of 71@xmath23 mjyster@xmath9 for iras00470 + 6429 and nearby objects . according to @xcite , ir",
    "cirrus affect both the 60@xmath11 m ( f@xmath46 ) and 100@xmath11 m fluxes of a point source even with a cs envelope , if _",
    "cirr3_/f@xmath47 15 .",
    "this ratio is over 30 for iras00440 + 6429 .",
    "therefore , the object s high 100@xmath11 m flux is unreliable .",
    "imaging at @xmath48 m @xcite and spectroscopy near @xmath49 m @xcite showed no features , specific to the post - agb evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "these results are inconclusive .",
    "although neither @xcite nor @xcite discarded the object from their ppn candidate lists , there is no compelling evidence that it undergoes this evolutionary stage .",
    "the main combination of features that distinguishes iras00470 + 6429 from most post - agb objects includes an early spectral type , strong emission - line spectrum and near - ir excess , and a flux decrease longward of the 25@xmath11 m iras band .",
    "typically the dust , responsible for the ir excess , is mostly produced during the agb stage . a strong stellar wind , which weakens as the object enters the post - agb stage , efficiently moves the dust away , so that a small fraction of hot dust survives near the star .",
    "this makes the near - ir excess small and produces a well - known double - peaked sed with the short - wavelength peak due to the direct star s radiation and the long - wavelength peak due to the dust radiation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the long - wavelength peak typically has the highest flux either in the 25@xmath11 m or in the 60@xmath11 m iras band .",
    "therefore , in an iras color - color diagram fscma objects may be mixed with those at the post - agb stage ( see * ? ? ?",
    ".    inspection of a recent catalog of ppne by @xcite shows that it contains 70 objects , which have been classified as b- or a - type stars .",
    "forty two of them have iras data , but only seven satisfy both photometric criteria for fscma objects ( see figs . 1 and 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "five of these seven objects have spectra with weak emission lines and many photospheric features .",
    "the remaining two objects are , which is an unconfirmed ppn and a candidate member of the fscma group @xcite , and , which was mentioned in @xcite as an example of a possible confusion between the fscma objects and intermediate - mass ppne .",
    "thus , iras00470 + 6429 is not a typical ppn of an early spectral type .",
    "m256 is a post - agb object surrounded by a bipolar nebula .",
    "according to @xcite , its closest distance ( 2 kpc ) coincides with that we suggest for iras00470 + 6429 .",
    "one possibility for our object to be a ppn is to evolve fast enough , so that its nebula is still too small to be resolved . during the post - agb stage ,",
    "objects keep roughly a constant luminosity , and their photospheric temperature increases at a different rate that depends on the object s mass .",
    "the highest - mass objects exhibit noticeable spectral changes over a timescale of a few decades .",
    "these changes are accompanied by a decrease of the optical brightness , as a wavelength of the strongest photospheric radiation shifts toward uv domain .",
    "our spectroscopic data for iras00470 + 6429 show no change in the spectral line content .",
    "its optical brightness in 20032008 ( @xmath50 mag ) is marginally lower than that in 1958 , when @xcite first recorded it as a 12.7mag star in the photographic region , which roughly corresponds to the modern @xmath51-band of the johnson photometric system .",
    "however , the accuracy of the latter estimate as well as that of its transformation into the @xmath51-magnitude system can not be verified .",
    "also , recognized high - mass ppne with strong emission - line spectra that also show evidence for a rapid spectral evolution ( see , e.g. , , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) exhibit much stronger forbidden lines and virtually no near - ir excess . finally , our luminosity estimate for the object is at least a factor of two lower than those expected for a fast - evolving post - agb object with physical parameter changes to be detected over a few decades @xcite .",
    "iras00470 + 6429 also has some similarities with lower - mass post - agb objects .",
    "these objects ( rv tau stars ) pulsate with periods of 30150 days due to being located within an instability strip .",
    "a group of them , known as rvb type , shows additional long - term photometric variations with periods from 600 to 1500 days @xcite .",
    "some rv tau stars are binary systems surrounded by dusty disks .",
    "there is a marginal detection of variability with a timescale of @xmath31200 days in the photometry ( see figure [ f5 ] ) .",
    "there is also independent , spectroscopic evidence ( see section [ binary ] ) that the system is a binary with a gaseous - and - dusty disk . on the other hand , rv tau stars exhibit spectroscopic properties of supergiants with weak emission - line spectra .",
    "they also have mostly f  k spectral types and a significant deficit of iron @xcite .",
    "if iras00470 + 6429 is an extremely evolved rv tau object , then one could expect to see some features of a planetary nebula , such as an expanding shell similar to the one observed in m256 , and evidence of a chemical evolution in the spectrum .",
    "no observation reported in this paper clearly supports that iras00470 + 6429 belongs to the rv tau group .",
    "fscma objects exhibit some features that are indicative of the presence of secondary stellar companions .",
    "some of them show absorption lines that are typical for late - type stars ( e.g. , li i 6708   and ca",
    "i 6717  ) in addition to emission lines that require the presence of a hot star .",
    "these are @xcite , , , and @xcite .",
    "also , has a degenerate secondary ( a white dwarf or a neutron star ) , which is thought to be responsible for a major eruption in the system in 1998 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a traveling emission line of he ii at 4686   with a similar profile to that of the he i lines in iras00470 +",
    "6429 was found in the spectrum of cicam by @xcite .",
    "the absence of high - excitation lines and the presence of a weak absorption line of li i at 6708   in the spectrum of iras00470 + 6429 suggest that its secondary companion is a late - type object .",
    "the line was detected in all our spectra taken at mcdonald and has an equivalent width of 0.04  .",
    "its heliocentric radial velocity was @xmath234 kms@xmath9 in 2005 december , @xmath2314 kms@xmath9 in 2006 december , and @xmath2318 kms@xmath9 in 2008 december .",
    "this virtual constance is inconsistent with the strong variations of the he i lines , so that these phenomena may not be related to each other .",
    "this information is insufficient to constrain the putative secondary s properties .",
    "the presence of the li i line might also be due to convection as a result of the hot bottom burning ( hbb ) process , which occurs during the agb stage @xcite .",
    "however , for this process to occur , the star has to be at a high end of the mass range of stars that follow this evolutionary path .",
    "if iras00470 + 6429 is a post - agb object , its luminosity we derive here is not high enough to have hbb .",
    "@xcite observed several objects in this luminosity range ( for example , ngc1866 @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) and have detected no traces of the li i 6708   line in their spectra .",
    "also , the radial velocity of this line in the spectrum of iras00470 + 6429 is significantly different from that of the few reliably detected photospheric absorption lines ( e.g. , mg ii 4481  ) and from those of fe ii emission lines , which are believed to trace the star s velocity .    using our photometric data and the fact that the li i line is the only one that does not seem to belong to the hot companion",
    ", we can roughly estimate an upper limit for the secondary s luminosity .",
    "it has to be a factor of a few less luminous than the hot companion near the li i line wavelength , otherwise traces of numerous absorption lines of neutral metals ( e.g. , fe i , ca i as , for instance , seen in the spectrum of mwc623 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would appear in the spectrum .",
    "the red spectral region seems to be slightly affected by the cs contribution , which is not well - constrained ( see section [ stel_par ] ) , but the secondary s continuum is not noticeable .",
    "therefore , the secondary should be at least 1 mag fainter in the @xmath14-band . if it is an early k  type star , as in the case of mwc623 @xcite , its luminosity does not exceed @xmath3500 l@xmath54 .",
    "given the available evidence , it is not possible to further constrain the secondary s spectral type .",
    "formally , this estimate assumes that the luminosity type is between iv and iii @xcite",
    ". a dwarf of any appropriate late spectral type would be too dim to reveal any of its features , while a bright giant or a supergiant would dominate in a region between @xmath30.51.5 @xmath11 m ( cs dust takes over at longer wavelengths ) .",
    "we accomplished a five - year long ( 20032008 ) photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of the optical counterpart of the ir source iras00470 + 6429 .",
    "our results in combination with other available data for the object and information about surrounding stars and associations allowed us to reach the following conclusions .    * the optical counterpart of iras00470 + 6429 is most likely a binary system with a b - type visible primary companion and a much fainter late - type secondary companion .",
    "the main indication in favor of the binary hypothesis is the presence of a weak li i 6708   absorption line in the object s spectrum . *",
    "the primary companion is a b2b3 spectral type with a luminosity of @xmath0 l / l@xmath1 = 3.9@xmath20.3 at a distance of 2.0@xmath20.3 kpc from the sun .",
    "the system probably belongs to the stellar association casob7 .",
    "properties of the association members need to be better constrained with high - resolution spectroscopy to improve its distance and investigate the fine internal structure , revealed in this study . *",
    "the optical brightness variations exceed 0.5 mag that is typical for fscma type objects .",
    "many lines in the spectrum of the b - type companion exhibit variable pcyg type profiles . also , multiple variable cs absorption components of the na i d - lines were detected .",
    "this indicates the presence of a significant amount of cs gas in the line of sight",
    ". nevertheless , most of the observed reddening has interstellar origin . *",
    "although some similarities with post - agb type objects can be identified in the properties of iras00470 + 6429 ( e.g. , possible long - term variation cycles ) , it is unlikely to be highly evolved .    the results of this study support our earlier hypothesis that fscma type objects are binary systems .",
    "the sparseness of our spectroscopic data did not allow us to find the orbital period of the iras00470 + 6429 system .",
    "in the next paper of this series we will present an initial attempt to model the wealth of data available for this object .",
