    "it should be noted that once log - likelihoods representing an instanton are distributed on the tree , one can verify directly ( by propagating messages from the leaves to the tree center ) that the algorithm produces zero a - posteriori log - likelihood at the tree center .",
    "any check node processes messages coming from the tree periphery in the following way : ( i ) the message with the smallest absolute value ( one assumes no degeneracy ) is passed , ( ii ) the source bit of the smallest message is `` colored '' , and ( iii ) the sign of the product of inputs is assigned to the outcome . at any bit that lies on the colored leaves - to - center path",
    "the incoming messages are summed up .",

    "the integer @xmath77 corresponding to bit @xmath20 of the original graph is the sum of the signatures over all colored replicas of @xmath20 on the computational tree .",

    "( [ var2 ] ) ) where @xmath92 lies exactly on the border of the monotone interval , i.e. at @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "one finds that structurally an instanton consists of three types of colored bits corresponding to @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "one also finds that for all the colored bits with @xmath96 all the respective @xmath77 approach the same limit , @xmath97 , even though respective @xmath81 may be distinct .",

    "there is actually a strong degeneracy here if the number of colored bits with @xmath96 is two or larger : the effective length depends only on @xmath107 , while otherwise , and modulo the requirement @xmath100 , the @xmath81 fields can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "therefore , to estimate the ber corresponding to the given set of integers , @xmath108 , thus explaining a continuous family of instantons rather then an individual instanton , one should also account for the degree of degeneracy ( volume of the respective part of the phase space ) , @xmath109 $ ] .",

    "1a ) is the white one .",
    "configuration ( b ) consists of three green bits , with @xmath134 , appearing four times each on the computational tree , and three red bits , with @xmath93 , appearing @xmath135 and @xmath136 times respectively . for this instanton",
    "one finds , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 ( @xmath101 is always @xmath140 for the four iterations decoder ) so that @xmath141 .",
    "the erroneous bit ( number @xmath142 ) is white .",
    "one bit , numbered @xmath143 , is special here .",
    "even though this bit has many replicas on the computational tree , thus potentially , it would be advantageous to have it green carrying the non - zero value of the noise , self - consistency strictly requires that @xmath144 .",
    "there are at least two reasons for this .",
    "first of all , if bit @xmath143 turns green making @xmath145 one of its replicas on the computational tree ( the one marked pale and adjusted to the red check / square in fig .",
    "1b ) screens bit @xmath146 ( positioned next to the red check ) in the sense that this screened bit will not contribute to @xmath147 .",
    "consequently , @xmath147 becomes @xmath136 and not @xmath126 , thus making @xmath102 smaller and @xmath148 larger .",
    "second , if @xmath149 then one of the @xmath123 replicas of the bit @xmath143 contributes a - posteriori log - likelihood at the tree center with `` @xmath150 '' sign and @xmath151 becomes equal to @xmath152 , rather than @xmath123 .",
    "this number is smaller than @xmath138 thus leading to the undesired effective length increase . finally , the resulting degeneracy in the instanton family is two - parametric ( corresponding to appearance of three , and not four , green bits ) : @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "configuration ( c ) has the same effective length as configuration ( b ) , @xmath155 , even though it is very different structurally .",
    "the ( c ) instanton has no green bits , thus it is non - degenerate and only one special configuration of @xmath156 fields is realized .",
    "there are four red bits , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , appearing on the computational tree @xmath159 and @xmath136 times respectively .",
    "the erroneous bit , @xmath142 , is red .",
    "the integers are @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , thus according to eq .",
    "( [ qc ] ) @xmath163 .    , for the @xmath2 code with four iterations of the min - sum decoding over the laplacian channel .",
    "solid and dashed lines show slopes ( defined upto a constant shift in the log - lin plot ) correspondent to the instanton with the shortest effective distance , @xmath131 , and to the ideal ml decoding with the hamming distance , @xmath164 , respectively . filled and empty circles show results of direct monte - carlo simulations for @xmath116 and @xmath165 iterations respectively . , width=384 ]    in @xcite we have argued , following the logic of @xcite , that each instanton is equidistant from some number of pseudo - codewords , i.e. codewords on the respective computational tree .",
    "this observation is obviously generic and thus it is applicable as well to the case of the laplacian channel considered in the manuscript .",
    "for any of the instantons discussed above and illustrated in fig .  1 there exists a respective pair of pseudo - codewords .",
    "( as argued in @xcite an instanton may be degenerate  corresponding to a triple or in principle to even larger set of pseudo - codewords .",
    "this degeneracy , that was found present in the awgn channel , was not observed here for the awln channel . )",
    "the first pseudo - codeword in a pair is just the all @xmath166 codeword ( @xmath166 sits at every bit ) .",
    "the second pseudo - codeword in a pair can be introduced according to the following rule : put @xmath167 at any colored ( i.e. white , green or red ) bit and @xmath166 at any uncolored ( thus not shown in fig .",
    "obviously this choice of the pseudo - codewords pairs is unambiguous .",
    "indeed the white bits that are not numbered can be chosen arbitrarily ( within appropriate bounds described above ) . moreover ,",
    "the ambiguity in choosing the second pseudo - codeword ( containing @xmath167 bits ) is even stronger .",
    "indeed , this second pseudo - codeword can consists only of two @xmath167 bits ( all other bits will carry @xmath166 ) : one @xmath167 should be positioned at any red bit ( with @xmath93 ) from the last generation of the computational tree and another @xmath167 is placed on any uncolored bit sharing a check with the red bit .",
    "this special form of degeneracy is due to the fact that log - likelihoods assigned to any red bit and to an uncolored bit adjusted to the red one are the same in absolute value but opposite in sign .",
    "the analysis of the previous section suggests that the leading @xmath36 asymptotic for ber ( and for the frame - error - rate as well ) is governed by the instanton with the lowest effective length found , i.e. @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "we have checked this prediction against direct monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations and found very good agreement already in the range accessible for the mc , @xmath170 .",
    "see fig .  2 .",
    "we observed that the actual behavior of ber is well described by the instanton not only in the asymptotic regime of highest snr but also in the regime of moderate snr where there is no a - priori reason to expect the instanton approximation to work so well .",
    "our further discussion is to eliminate this point suggesting a plausible explanation for this surprising generality of the instanton asymptotic .",
    "let us first clarify why the validity of the instanton asymptotic at the moderate values of snr shown in fig .",
    "2 is surprising . indeed , according to eq .",
    "( [ lap1 ] ) the average value of the noise configuration length , @xmath171 , unconstrained by the requirement to have zero a - posteriori log - likelihood at a bit , is @xmath172 .",
    "this means that even at @xmath173 ( the largest snr shown in fig .",
    "2 ) , where the error probability is already small , @xmath174 , the typical length of noise realization is still essentially larger then the respective instanton prediction : @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , naively one expects the instanton to work well at @xmath176 , where @xmath177 , while according to the mc results shown in fig .",
    "2 the instanton asymptotic sets already at @xmath178 , where @xmath179 . (",
    "notice , that the situation for the gaussian channel is similar , see fig .",
    "s2 of @xcite .",
    "there the typical @xmath180 is @xmath181 , resulting in @xmath182 , while the respective instanton value is @xmath183 . )",
    "our approach to explaining the validity of the instanton asymptotic already at the moderate nsr is of the reverse engineering type : we first formalize what the monte - carlo results suggest and then present a plausible explanation for this phenomenon .    one useful object is the probability distribution function of the channel noise length ( fully unconstrained ) , that gets the following forms for the gaussian and laplacian channels respectively : @xmath184^{-1 } \\exp(-l \\cdot      s)$ ] and @xmath185^{-1 }      \\exp(-l^2 \\cdot s^2/2)$ ] .",
    "typical noise configuration forms a `` spherical '' layer with `` radius '' @xmath186 in the @xmath11-dimensional noise space ( or @xmath187 for the gaussian channel ) .",
    "spherical \" layer becomes thinner as @xmath11 grows .",
    "obviously @xmath188 does depend on the channel but it does not depend on the decoding scheme . another useful object , that is decoding sensitive , is the ( cumulative ) distribution function @xmath189 of the length for the points positioned exactly at the error - surface .",
    "estimation for fer is related to the area of spherical layer that lies outside of the error surface : @xmath190 . strictly speaking this relation is exact for the gaussian channel , but it is only qualitatively right ( up to a @xmath191 coefficient accounting accurately for the phase factor ) in the laplacian channel case .",
    "the integral @xmath190 can be viewed as the laplace transform .",
    "deducing from the monte carlo simulations that the instanton asymptotic is valid , @xmath192 ( or @xmath193 for the gaussian channel ) one derives by the inverse laplace transform @xmath194 ( or @xmath195 for the gaussian channel ) .",
    "we suggest that the special dependence of @xmath196 on @xmath197 , deduced from the mc simulations , corresponds to an @xmath198-dimensional area of the part of error - surface with lengths @xmath197 or less , @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the respective line element .",
    "given that the instanton configuration is extremal one assumes that , @xmath201 , that results exactly in the right expression for @xmath189 in the gaussian channel .",
    "we ought to assume that in the laplacian channel case expansion of @xmath197 with respect to @xmath202 about @xmath203 , is of another type , @xmath204 , thus confirming the @xmath189 dependence on @xmath197 observed in the laplacian channel simulations .",
    "the set of tasks formulated in the introductory section was accomplished in sections [ sec : theo]-[sec : amoeba ] .",
    "we have shown for the example of the laplacian channel that the instanton - amoeba optimization scheme , introduced in @xcite and tested in @xcite for the gaussian channel , is computationally efficient .",
    "we extended the theoretical analysis of @xcite , based on the computational tree approach of @xcite , explaining the rational structure of instantons in the laplacian channel .",
    "the instantons are shown to be different for different channels considered with the same coding / decoding scheme .",
    "even though the fact that effective lengths differ for different channels was already demonstrated in @xcite for the example of the binary symmetric and binary erasure channels , this manuscript additionally proved that not only the effective weights but also the instanton configurations themselves were different structurally for different channels .",

    "<S> however , it was also shown that the approximate algorithms are incapable of matching the performance of maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding beyond the so - called error - floor threshold found at higher signal - to - noise - ratios ( snr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of error - floor , i.e. highest snr , analysis was recognized in the early stages of the turbo code revolution @xcite , and it soon became apparent that ldpc codes are also not immune to the error - floor deficiency @xcite . to estimate the error - floor asymptotics in modern high - quality systems is a notoriously difficult task because direct numerical methods , e.g.  monte carlo , can not be used to determine bit - error - rate ( ber ) below @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the main approaches to the error - floor analysis problem proposed to date include : ( i ) a heuristic approach of the importance sampling type @xcite , utilizing theoretical considerations developed for a typical randomly constructed ldpc code performing over the binary - erasure channel @xcite , and ( ii ) deriving lower bounds for ber @xcite .    recently </S>",
    "<S> , we ( in collaboration with v.  chernyak and b.  vasic ) have also proposed a physics inspired approach that is capable of a computationally tractable analysis of the error floor phenomenon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an efficient numerical scheme was proposed , which was ab - initio by construction , i.e.  the optimization scheme required no additional assumptions ( e.g.  no sampling ) . </S>",
    "<S> this numerical optimization scheme , called the instanton - amoeba scheme , which plays a central role in our analysis , was shown to be accurate at producing configurations whose validity , for actual optimal noise configurations , can be verified theoretically . finally , the instanton - amoeba scheme , introduced in @xcite , is also generic , in that there are no restrictions related to the type of decoding or the channel .    to illustrate the last , most important point , we complement the analysis of @xcite that focused on the white gaussian symmetric channel , by using the new results for the white laplacian channel explained in this manuscript . </S>",
    "<S> our choice of the laplacian channel is arbitrary , e.g. influenced by its relevance to the description of fiber - optics communication channels . </S>",
    "<S> ( amplifier noise , known to have gaussian statistics , contributes additively to the electric signal carrying the information . </S>",
    "<S> however , the intensity , the electric field squared , is detected on the receiver end . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the resulting transition probability , characterizing the noise in the fiber optics channel as the whole , shows exponential tails . </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite for a discussion of these and other statistical errors in fiber optics channels . )    </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to demonstrate using the example of the laplacian channel that    * the numerical optimization approach to finding the most damaging configuration of the noise , instanton - amoeba , is computationally efficient . * </S>",
    "<S> subsequent theoretical analysis of the iterative decoding instanton based on the notion of the computational tree is channel specific , but it is also generalizable , i.e. the theoretical scheme can be modified to explain the rational structure of instantons for any , in particular laplacian , channel . * </S>",
    "<S> instanton configurations for different channels are different . </S>",
    "<S> thus , information on the error - floor analysis available for a channel ( say , for the gaussian channel ) does not allow quantitative description of the error - floor in another channel ( say , in the laplacian channel ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this manuscript is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the problem of error - floor analysis , introduce the laplacian channel and briefly review the results of @xcite in section  [ sec : intro ] . our theoretical analysis , generalizing the computational tree approach of @xcite , is detailed in section  [ sec : theo ] . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : amoeba ] explains results of numerical instanton - amoeba evaluation . </S>",
    "<S> here we present the three most important ( for @xmath1 ) instantons , for example of the min - sum decoding with four iterations performing over the @xmath2 ldpc code described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss here how the numerically found instanton is rationalized / explained theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of monte carlo simulations and instanton prediction is discussed in section  [ sec : moderate ] . </S>",
    "<S> some final remarks and comments are presented in section  [ sec : concl ] concluding the manuscript . </S>"
