    "particle removal reactions of various types ( nucleon transfer , knockout , stripping and so on ) have for a long time been one of the most powerful tools for investigation of nuclear structure @xcite .",
    "we are here concerned with a class of reactions at high energies (  stripping \" in the sense of the word used originally by serber @xcite ) of which the deuteron breakup is the archetype .",
    "the strong current interest in these reactions is that they , in inverse kinematics , provide a unique opportunity to obtain simultaneously partial probabilities for populating individual final states leading to spectroscopic factors as well as momentum distributions characteristic of the quantum numbers of the removed nucleon .",
    "this allows one to access detailed information on the internal structure of projectile and residue .",
    "nuclear breakup reactions are widely used nowadays for studying radioactive nuclei @xcite .",
    "a new method was suggested recently for the spectroscopy with radioactive beams @xcite which is well suited both for  normal \" and for halo nuclei .",
    "the method uses the longitudinal momentum distribution of the projectile residue (  core \" ) for the determination of the orbital angular momentum of the stripped nucleon .",
    "the identification is possible via the comparison of the experimental distribution with the theoretical one calculated , for instance , in the framework of the glauber model @xcite .",
    "the association of the definite orbital momentum value with the shape of the longitudinal momentum distribution is clearly justified for spherical nuclei .",
    "first , for a spherically symmetric unpolarized projectile , the role of the spin - orbit interaction is not essential for the stripping mechanism .",
    "second , the longitudinal momentum distribution is sensitive to the projection @xmath0 of the orbital momentum of the stripped particle onto the beam direction . as a rule , the largest of the possible @xmath0-values for a given @xmath1 value dominates , and this @xmath1- and @xmath0-dependence allows one to determine the orbital momentum more or less uniquely @xcite .",
    "the results of a recent series of experiments with spherical or weakly deformed nuclei @xcite confirm the applicability and flexibility of the method .",
    "recently the first attempt has been made to apply the same techniques to strongly deformed projectiles .",
    "the inclusive reaction @xmath2be(@xmath3al,@xmath4mg)x was investigated in @xcite .",
    "many neutron - rich nuclei , for example neon and magnesium isotopes in the region @xmath5 ( the island of inversion @xcite ) , are expected to be strongly deformed , and the role of intruder configurations , such as the @xmath6 $ ] level coming from the @xmath7-shell , is extremely important @xcite .",
    "this follows from the theoretical calculations @xcite and from the results of the latest measurements of the transition probabilities @xmath8 in neutron - rich @xmath9ne and @xmath10 mg isotopes via intermediate - energy coulomb excitation @xcite .",
    "available information on the structure of the nuclei in the inversion island is scanty , and one can hope to extract the shape parameters from the analysis of the stripping reactions and corresponding momentum distributions .    however , in order to correctly interpret experimental data for the deformed nuclei , one needs to modify essentially existing theoretical approaches .",
    "several features of nuclear deformation should be taken into account consistently in the reaction description : ( i ) the deformed mean field of the core is responsible for the strong mixing of different orbital momenta of the stripped valence nucleon ; ( ii ) although in the case of axial symmetry the projection of the nucleon total angular momentum on the symmetry axis is still a good quantum number ( usually denoted as @xmath11 ) , the energy splitting and therefore difference in the population of different doubly degenerate @xmath12 levels preclude complete averaging and stress the effects of the spin - orbit coupling ; ( iii ) pure intrinsic @xmath11-states of the nucleon have no definite angular momentum projection in the laboratory reference frame defined by the beam direction .",
    "all mentioned elements are well known but we have to incorporate them consistently in the reaction formalism .",
    "the realistic calculations along these lines imply cumbersome and time consuming numerical work .",
    "this might be one of the reasons why , in spite of the growing interest in reactions with deformed nuclei @xcite , our attempt is apparently the first one of this kind .    of course",
    ", scattering by nonspherical nuclei has been studied long ago .",
    "the most general formalism for this purpose is the coupled channel method outlined in the book @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is rather hard to use this technically complicated method for the description of realistic reactions .",
    "a considerably simpler approach , namely the adiabatic approximation , was proposed by drozdov and inopin in the middle of the fifties @xcite .",
    "they used the partial wave expansion of the scattering wave function and assumed that the collective motion ( rotation or vibration ) of the deformed target nucleus is frozen during the collision time , being very slow compared to other degrees of freedom .",
    "the term `` adiabatic '' refers to the orientational and shape degrees of freedom only and should not be confused with the adiabaticity with respect to valence nucleon motion .",
    "the latter assumption is also frequently used in glauber theory for the description of the reaction mechanism .",
    "the glauber adiabaticity means that , starting at energies of 50 - 100 mev per nucleon , the characteristic time scales for the relative projectile - target motion and for the nucleon internal motion inside the projectile are getting very different .    in the framework of the orientational adiabatic approximation ,",
    "it is impossible to examine the deep excitations of the core . at the same time ,",
    "soft excitations , with no essential reorganization of the internal core structure , are quite treatable .",
    "typical energies of collective rotational states are low @xcite compared to characteristic reaction energies .",
    "in some sense we have here nearly the same situation as in perturbation theory for close or degenerate states . to be consistent with the adiabatic approximation",
    ", we fix the orientation of interacting objects during the collision .",
    "the state with a certain orientation is a wave packet of stationary angular momentum states .",
    "this means that after the collision various rotational members of the superposition can be excited .    at the end of the seventies ,",
    "abgrall _ et al . _",
    "@xcite combined the coupled channel formalism with the glauber scattering theory to describe the excitation of the ground state rotational band by medium energy ( 1 gev ) protons . the regular treatment of the adiabatic approximation in the framework of the glauber theory was given in 1990 by fldt and glauber @xcite .",
    "they treated only soft rotational excitations without restructuring of the internal projectile wave function .",
    "the deformation effect on the stripping cross section was studied only for the relativistic deuteron stripping @xcite ( see also @xcite for a qualitative discussion of the deformation effect on the tensor analyzing power for light projectiles ) .",
    "the approach of our work , being a natural continuation of the guideline @xcite , is , on the other hand , close to the formulation suggested in the recent paper by christley and tostevin @xcite .",
    "these authors came to a conclusion that the deformation is not very important for the total ( angle - integrated ) reaction cross sections : the corresponding change is less than 1@xmath13 .",
    "our results are consistent with this conclusion .",
    "however , the longitudinal momentum distributions and partial cross sections for stripping from deformed orbitals , which are a strong mixture of spherical single - particle states , are sensitive to deformation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the semi - microscopic reaction formalism , taking into account the deformation of the projectile , is developed in sec .",
    "[ se1 ] ; the influence of the deformation on the stripping reaction is analyzed , and expressions for the cross section and the longitudinal momentum distribution of the projectile residue are obtained .",

    "the interplay of the internal structure of the projectile and the reaction mechanism is illustrated for the model @xmath2be(@xmath14p,@xmath15si)x reaction .",
    "we discuss the perspectives for further studies and propose new experiments in a possible region of large deformation in neutron - rich mg isotopes .",
    "summary and final remarks are made in the concluding section .",
    "in the description of projectile breakup reactions , the established terminology is slightly different from that conventionally used in the theory of direct reactions @xcite .",
    "two processes are usually distinguished , stripping ( or absorption ) and diffraction ( or elastic breakup ) . in this word usage ( see , for example , @xcite ) , elastic breakup is the process in which the projectile core and the valence , in particular halo , particle are in the continuum states after the interaction with the target .",
    "in addition , the projectile residue ( core ) and the target remain in their respective ground states .",
    "we generalize this definition to include possible  soft \" excitations of the core nucleus , such as collective rotations , which disturb the intrinsic structure in a minimal way .",
    "the absorption differs from the elastic breakup by possible excitations of the core and disappearance of the valence particle in the final state due to the absorption by the target . in this work",
    "we restrict overselves by the treatment of the stripping / absorption type of breakup reactions only .",
    "this is , generally , the dominant channel @xcite , except for the halo states . before considering the reaction in detail , let us agree on a general framework of the approach .",
    "target and core nuclei are treated as structureless particles in the actual calculations .",
    "all the observables depend on the internal structure of the core and the target only indirectly via corresponding interaction potentials and density functions .",
    "nevertheless , we retain the explicit dependence on the internal jacobi coordinates of the colliding nuclei in the derivation of the basic formulas .",
    "this makes the derivation more transparent and shows the way for extending the approach .",
    "in addition , the core may be deformed , in contrast to previous treatments @xcite .",
    "therefore we need to fix its orientation ( more precisely , the orientation of the core mean field which determines the geometry of the orbitals for the valence nucleon ) .",
    "although we assume here that the core is axially symmetric , the approach can be generalized for triaxial deformation that would be more suitable for nuclei such as , for example , @xmath4 mg . in a similar way , the deformation of the target can be accounted for as would be necessary for transfer reactions .",
    "the interaction of a valence nucleon ( for definiteness , a proton ) with the target , p+t , and the core - target , c+t , interaction are described in terms of phenomenological optical potentials . for the c+t interaction ,",
    "the convolution of a nucleon - target phenomenological potential with the core density is used .",
    "we do not employ the traditional glauber approach based on the nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitudes @xcite because of relatively small kinetic energy per nucleon in the projectile in the experiments we try to describe .",
    "it is known , however , that the region of validity of the glauber approximation extends considerably beyond what one could expect from the approximations made in the standard derivation @xcite .",
    "therefore , our approach can turn out to be very similar to that of glauber .",
    "the calculations are performed either in the `` laboratory '' frame , with the origin coinciding with the projectile center - of - mass @xmath16 and @xmath17-axis along the beam direction , or in the body - fixed frame , characterized by the origin at the core @xmath18 and @xmath19-axis along the core symmetry axis .",

    "= 10.0 cm    the description of stripping reactions with exotic nuclei has its roots in the early works on the deuteron stripping @xcite .",
    "attempts to construct a more regular theory of stripping processes have appeared considerably later @xcite . referring to the deuteron stripping reaction formalism as a suitable framework for exotic nuclei fragmentation @xcite , it is assumed by analogy that a stripped projectile constituent ( proton ) interacts strongly with the target nucleus .",
    "the core of the projectile escapes as an analog of the neutron .",
    "the only difference is the possibility for the core to be excited during the collision .",
    "the total stripping cross section in such an approach is analogous to the proton stripping from the deuteron @xcite .",
    "below we sketch briefly the formal derivation of the total stripping cross section and the core longitudinal momentum distribution .",
    "the projectile ( core + valence nucleon ) initial wave function is @xmath22 where the plane wave describes motion of the center - of - mass with respect to the target , and the initial intrinsic wave function of the projectile @xmath23 is a sum of antisymmetrized products of the core internal wave functions generated by the operator @xmath24 and the function of the relative proton - core motion ( creation operator @xmath25 ) . here",
    "the superscript @xmath26 enumerates various core states , @xmath27 are single - particle orbitals , and @xmath28 are corresponding spectroscopic amplitudes .",
    "the calculation of the spectroscopic amplitudes for all possible combinations @xmath29 requires very specific and hard work .",
    "frequently only one possibility is allowed or is taken into account , which corresponds to a definite configuration , for example to the ground state of the spherical ( deformed ) core + the proton occupying a certain spherical ( deformed ) orbital .",
    "this approximation works fairly well in the case of light or halo projectiles when there are no bound excited states .",
    "the situation is more complicated for projectile nuclei which possess many particle - bound states .",
    "we limit ourselves by using the same approximation with the spectroscopic amplitudes calculated in the framework of the particle - rotor model , consistent with our general approach , or borrowed from the shell - model calculations @xcite . in the case of a deformed core ,",
    "the internal wave function contains information about the orientation of the core symmetry axis with respect to the space - fixed frame ( the corresponding spherical harmonic @xmath30 ) , and the single - particle quantum states @xmath27 are quantized onto the intrinsic symmetry axis .",
    "the situation with the final state wave function is even more complicated because here we have to sum over all possible final configurations of the core and valence proton , including the ones where the knocked out proton is absorbed by the target . we do not consider the exact structure of this wave function",
    "instead we determine @xcite the absorption cross section through a deficit of the probability for the proton to be found at some point @xmath31 that appears as a result of the p+t interaction .",
    "such an approach is based essentially on the spectator mechanism of the stripping reaction and is adequate only in a narrow kinematic region .",
    "this mechanism presupposes that the proton is stripped off the projectile while the remaining core fragment continues its motion essentially without being disturbed except for a smooth action of the optical core - target potential @xmath32 taken into account by the eikonal core phase shift .",
    "the incident energy of the projectile has to be sufficiently large and the scattering angle of the core must be small to ensure the applicability of the eikonal approximation @xcite .",
    "it is assumed in the framework of the spectator mechanism that the nucleus - nucleus interaction time is too short for a change of the core symmetry axis direction .",
    "as we mentioned , this means the possibility to reveal various rotational components of the frozen orientation .",
    "therefore the final - state deformed core wave function @xmath33 contains a spherical harmonic @xmath34 , which defines the same direction of the core symmetry axis as before the projectile breakup ( adiabatic approximation ) , but in general with @xmath35 .    according to the idea of the glauber approximation and our hypotheses of the reaction mechanism ,",
    "the reaction yield is determined by the profile functions for the propagation of the valence proton , @xmath36 , and the core , @xmath37 , in the field of the target potentials , p+t and c+t , respectively @xcite , @xmath38 @xmath39 here and below we have adopted units with @xmath40 . the coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath41",
    "are expressed from fig .",
    "[ fff0 ] as @xmath42 the impact parameter vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 are their corresponding two - dimensional projections onto the plane perpendicular to the beam direction .    in the same spirit ,",
    "the ( core + proton ) glauber wave function in the final state , projected onto definite states of core and proton motion with momenta @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , is @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 here we again take into account the interactions with the target by means of the eikonal phase shifts @xcite .",
    "the stripping reaction is defined essentially as disappearance of the proton from the projectile as a result of the collision with the target .",
    "we need to compare the probabilities for the proton to be found at some point @xmath50 with and without the p+t interaction .",
    "the probability amplitude for the core in a given configuration @xmath26 to have the momentum @xmath45 and for the valence proton , emerging from the intrinsic state @xmath27 with the spectroscopic amplitude @xmath51 , to be found at the position @xmath31 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the function of the relative proton - core motion in the projectile nucleus , and we omit the arguments of the profile functions as well as the superscript @xmath26 . the phase integrals in the profile functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 in ( [ dfrte ] )",
    "are now taken from @xmath57 to @xmath58 and do not depend on the @xmath17-components of the core and proton radius - vectors .",
    "the intrinsic matrix element in ( [ dfrte ] ) and the profile function @xmath55 contain the orientation parameters of the deformed core which are adiabatically fixed during the collision .",
    "therefore the whole amplitude @xmath59 is still an operator in orientation angles .",
    "thus , apart from the stripping probability , it will determine the rotational excitations of the remaining core .",
    "the core final momentum is a sum of @xmath60 ( the core part of the initial momentum of the projectile as a whole ) and the internal momentum @xmath61 corresponding to relative core - proton motion inside the projectile . due to the large mass difference , @xmath62 , we can put @xmath63 and obtain for the exponent in the integrand ( [ dfrte ] ) @xmath64 eq .",
    "( [ dfrte ] ) thus can be rewritten as @xmath65 without the p+t interaction , the expression ( [ dfrt ] ) reduces to @xmath66 the probability for the proton to get absorbed in different spatial points @xmath31 , provided that the core escapes with the momentum @xmath45 , is proportional to the difference of the squares of the absolute values of the orientational matrix elements of the operators ( [ dftk ] ) and ( [ dfrt ] ) between the given rotational states of the core , @xmath67 here we have explicitly written the arguments of the profile functions and preserved only those parts of the core wave functions that define the orientation of the core mean field . in the integrand we have the product of four factors : two spherical harmonics defining the core rotational state before and after the interaction with the target , the core profile function ( our operator ) , and the function of the proton - core relative motion @xmath68 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath68 upon the core orientation is considered in detail in the next section .",
    "the approach above ensures the correct limit of spherical symmetry .",
    "indeed , in this case all factors in ( [ drtm ] ) , except the spherical functions , do not depend on the orientation angles @xmath69 , and the orthonormalization of the spherical harmonics singles out the diagonal transition of the core .",
    "another way to consider the core orientation would be to retain the spherical harmonics up to the final calculation of the stripping differential / total cross section and then average over all possible directions of the core symmetry axis .",
    "this would however imply ignoring interference contributions between the processes of rotational recoil of the core occurring at different positions of the core .",
    "in addition , in that case we encounter a technical problem of summation over all possible final projections @xmath70 ( final channels ) .",
    "since the values of @xmath70 are connected with the orientation of the core axis @xmath69 , the simple summation can lead to the double counting .",
    "the differential cross section for the core final momentum @xmath71 is obtained , as in the deuteron stripping theory @xcite , after integrating the difference of probabilities ( [ drtm ] ) on the interaction plane , orthogonal to the projectile direction , over the proton impact parameter @xmath43 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 means , as usual , the averaging over the initial angular momentum projections and summation over the final ones .",
    "here we made a change of variable from the set @xmath31 and @xmath41 to the set @xmath31 and @xmath74 .",
    "the three - dimensional momentum distribution of the core ( [ jiopp ] ) differs from the results of refs .",
    "@xcite by the presence of the spherical harmonics with the additional integration over @xmath69 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution of the core is obtained by integrating over the transverse components @xmath75 , @xmath76 the total proton stripping cross section follows after the integration over @xmath77 , @xmath78 the expression obtained in a number of works @xcite differs by the absence of the angular integral .",
    "in fact , these results are known from the theory of deuteron stripping @xcite , of course again without deformation effects .",
    "the more complicated and formal approaches , such as , for example , based on ref .",
    "@xcite , do not bring any real advantage .",
    "the presence of the angular integral in ( [ jiop5],[polop ] ) , together with the angular dependence of the core profile function @xmath79 and , especially , the proton wave function @xmath68 , makes a practical calculation of the longitudinal momentum distribution ( [ jiop5 ] ) and the total stripping cross section ( [ polop ] ) a difficult computational problem .",
    "( [ polop ] ) , for example , contains seven embedded integrals .",
    "in addition , the function @xmath68 and its arguments depend on the angular variables in a very complicated way . to ensure the resonable accuracy one needs to carefully check the convergence of each numerical integration .",
    "in practice we have used a time consuming combination of the grid integration with the monte carlo methods .",
    "we guess that these technical problems were and remain up to now the main obstacle preventing the consistent account of the deformation effects in the calculation of reaction observables .",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution may be calculated directly from ( [ jiop5 ] ) .",
    "technically , this is very time - consuming . indeed",
    ", we need to perform a multidimensional integration over single - particle and core coordinates and over the orientational angles @xmath69 . prior to that",
    ", we have to calculate the core profile function @xmath37 as a convolution of the nucleon - target potential with a core density distribution which , in turn , strongly depends on the orientation of the core symmetry axis . to avoid these technical difficulties",
    ", one can use a simpler approach developed in @xcite on the  physical \" level of rigor .    in the approach",
    "@xcite we assume that the profile functions are step functions (  black disc \" approximation ) .",
    "further , the interaction time is very short ( a sudden approximation ) so that the core after reaction retains the same momentum distribution as in the projectile before the collision with a target . due to conservation of the total momentum ,",
    "the core momentum distribution is determined by that for the stripped valence nucleon inside the projectile .",
    "therefore , one needs to calculate the the three - dimentional fourier transform of the part of the initial valence nucleon wave function which is cut out by the target .",
    "geometrically the overlapping region of the valence nucleon wave function with the target corresponds @xcite to a cylinder with the axis along the beam direction and the radius defined @xcite by the effective radius of the target @xmath80 .",

    "we move along the only nilsson @xmath112 $ ] orbital that corresponds to a single value of @xmath120 @xcite and , of course , can not account for other orbitals . to be consistent with the nilsson model , we do not draw the momentum distributions for the mixture of different @xmath121 states .",
    "the total stripping cross sections obtained from ( [ frty ] ) by integration over @xmath77 are shown in table  1 .",
    "although the cross section generally decreases with the growth of the deformation , in the region @xmath122 , where the deformation parameter corresponds to the realistic value @xmath123 @xcite for the @xmath4 mg core , the cross section reaches the minimum and starts to increase again .",
    "this can be considered as a hint toward the explanation of the difference between the theoretical cross section calculated in the framework of spherical nuclei and the experimental one .",
    "note again that for a comparison with the case of sperical symmetry we need to take into account the stripping from two additional single - particle orbitals @xmath124 $ ] and @xmath125 $ ] ; the corresponding stripping cross sections at @xmath126 are equal to 18.6 and 25.28 mb .",
    "the standard averaging over the different orbitals gives approximately 21 mb for the cross section corresponding to the absence of the deformation which agrees resonably well with the value of @xmath12726 mb , calculated for the spherically symmetric projectile and realistic valence proton wave function ( with correct asymptotic behavior ) .",
    "our cross sections should always be smaller than their counterparts for the functions with correct asymptotics .    in the calculation of the longitudinal momentum distributions and stripping cross sections",
    "we have used the following values for the effective target radius and minimum impact parameter : @xmath128 fm ( it corresponds to the cross section @xmath129 mb for the free proton interaction with @xmath2be ) and @xmath130 fm .",
    "the cross sections , in mb , for the stripping of the @xmath112 $ ] proton from @xmath3al to the @xmath4 mg ground state rotational band at different deformation parameters @xmath114 .",
    "+    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 10.0 cm    one of the attractive features of our simple approach is the possibility to treat the stripping reactions with the core excitation in the same manner .",
    "for example , for the particular reaction @xmath2be(@xmath14p,@xmath15si@xmath131)x with the detection of the excited projectile residue @xmath15si@xmath131 , we have three orbitals in the @xmath83-shell , @xmath112 $ ] , @xmath124 $ ] , and @xmath132 $ ] .",
    "assuming that the measured @xcite cross section is originated by the knockout from an individual orbital we obtain the longitudinal momentum distributions shown in figs .",
    "[ fff3]-[fff5 ] . for the comparison with experimental data ,",
    "@xmath133 mb , we have to sum the partial cross sections because the different core final states were not separated in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the corresponding values are shown in the last row of table  4 including the contribution from the ground state orbital @xmath134 $ ] given in table 3 . in the treatment with the use of the spherical shell model @xcite it is important to include the relevant spectroscopic factors . in the simple nilsson model used here",
    ", we assume that pairing is weak and that the occupation numbers simply take the values ( 0,1,2 ) .",
    "we do not take into account the relevant spectroscopic factors which depend on the deformation of the core mean field and can not be merely borrowed from the standard shell - model calculations . to make our consideration fully quantitative , we would need also ( i ) to correct the asymptotic behavior of harmonic oscillator wave functions , ( ii ) to take into account feeding from high - lying states @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even oversimplified estimations of the partial and total cross sections , table  4 , show a relatively weak dependence on deformation whereas the shape of the longitudinal momentum distributions , figs .",
    "[ fff3]-[fff5 ] , is more sensitive to the deformation parameter .    based on those results",
    "we may try to predict the shape of the longitudinal momentum distributions of the projectile residue in reactions with strongly deformed nuclei . as a possible candidate for the role of the deformed projectile we can use neutron - rich @xmath9ne or @xmath10 mg isotopes .",
    "the measurements and analysis of recent work @xcite allow one to expect a large deformation of these nuclei .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to study the longitudinal momentum distributions of the projectile residue , for example in the reaction @xmath2be(@xmath135mg,@xmath136mg@xmath137)x .",
    "the preliminary estimate based on the measurement of the reduced transition probability @xmath8 gives @xmath138 for the deformation parameter of the projectile .",
    "it corresponds to the knockout of a neutron either from @xmath139 $ ] or from @xmath140 $ ] nilsson orbitals ( here we extrapolate the appropriate nilsson diagram to large deformations ) .",
    "the first orbital comes out from the @xmath7-shell ( intruder ) whereas the second one belongs to the @xmath83-shell .",
    "the orbitals intersect just in the region of @xmath114 indicated by the experiment @xcite .",
    "thus , we obtain an interesting possibility to determine actual deformation of @xmath135 mg via the comparison with experimental data and clarify the internal structure of this nucleus .",
    "similar arguments are true for other isotopes in this region . to illustrate this possibility we have calculated , see fig .",
    "[ fff6 ] , the longitudinal momentum distributions for the neutron knocked out from @xmath140 $ ] nilsson orbital , solid curve , and from the intruder orbital @xmath139 $ ] , dashed curve . two results differ very strongly both in the magnitude of the cross section and , which is even more essential , in shape .",
    "the estimate of the corresponding total cross sections gives @xmath141 mb for the @xmath140 $ ] and @xmath142 mb for the @xmath139 $ ] orbital .",
    "we investigated the influence of the projectile deformation on stripping cross sections and longitudinal momentum distributions of the core . for this purpose",
    "we developed an appropriate formalism treating the deformed projectile mean field as in the standard nilsson model .",
    "in practical calculations , we limited ourselves by the fast processes with the core nucleus as a spectator its orientation being adiabatically fixed during the short collision time .",
    "the study of reactions like @xmath2be(@xmath3al,@xmath4mg@xmath143)x , @xmath2be(@xmath14p,@xmath15si@xmath137)x , and @xmath2be(@xmath14p,@xmath15si@xmath131)x shows the following .",
    "+ ( i ) the general influence of the deformation on the stripping cross section and the core longitudinal momentum distribution is relatively weak for the knockout of nucleons from orbitals which are not , or are only slightly , mixed by the deformed mean field of the projectile .",
    "nevertheless , even in such cases it is possible to reproduce the details of the experimental longitudinal momentum distributions only taking into account the deformation effects .",
    "+ ( ii ) the deformation of the projectile is seen the most clearly in the knockout of nucleons from the strongly mixed orbitals . in the case of the axial symmetry it corresponds to the lowest possible @xmath11 .",
    "+ ( iii ) the influence of deformation may be less pronounced in the case of halo systems where the wave function of the valence nucleon is extended far outside the core . the choice of @xmath144be as a projectile @xcite seems to be a good testing ground for verifying this conclusion .",
    "+ ( iv ) the use of harmonic - oscillator wave functions with a wrong asymptotic behavior at large distances is quite meaningful for a projectile with high nucleon separation energy .",
    "+ ( v ) the geometric approach to the description of the stripping reactions is quite applicable for an estimation of the reaction cross sections but it is oversimplified for reproducing the longitudinal momentum distributions where we need to use a more detailed semi - microscopical treatment .",
    "+ ( vi ) the developed in seq .",
    "[ se1 ] semi - microscopic approach appears to account for the symmetric `` shoulders '' of the longitudinal momentum distributions appearing in the experimental data .",
    "we take this as the first evidence of the necessity of incorporating the effects of deformation in the theory of the high - energy stripping reactions .",
    "+ ( vii ) the analysis of the shape of the core longitudinal momentum distribution allows one to estimate the degree of the projectile deformation .",
    "this is necessary for determining the internal structure of radioactive nuclei .",
    "the region of neutron - rich heavy magnesium isotopes would be a promising field for future experiments .",
    "+ ( viii ) it would be interesting to demonstrate in further calculations the predicted by a simpler approach difference in the momentum distributions of a strongly deformed core for the processes leading to the individual members of a rotational band .",
    "+ ( ix ) in the case of the deformed projectile it is impossible to neglect the spin - orbit interaction since it defines the single - particle orbitals in the deformed core mean field .",
    "+ ( x ) an analysis of experimental data ignoring the effects of the deformation can lead to significant errors in assigning orbital angular momentum involved in the stripping reaction .",
