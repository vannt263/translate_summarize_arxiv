    "since the quantum cascade laser ( qcl ) was introduced more than 20 years ago @xcite it has continuously been improved and redesigned to operate from the mid - infrared all the way down to the terahertz ( thz ) range .",
    "compact laser sources at these wavelengths are valuable for spectroscopic applications   @xcite but a major problem is that thz qcls do not operate at room temperature .",
    "this can be overcome via difference frequency generation which recently has been demonstrated at powers in the milli - watt range  @xcite .",
    "direct thz - qcls still generate a lot of interest in the research community due to the promise of higher wall - plug efficiency and the prospects of miniaturization of cryo - coolers .",
    "the main temperature degrading mechanism of the thz qcls is currently not fully understood and is still debated by the community  @xcite .",
    "this is a challenge to theory and there is a great need of realistic modeling tools that are able to treat all important quantum effects on the same footing .",
    "a summary of different methods for simulating these structures is found in  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations have shown that electron - electron interaction , beyond the meanfield or hartree approximation can influence the dynamics of thz qcls  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we include and study the effects of a simple electron - electron scattering via the single plasmon pole approximation ( sppa )   @xcite . in this approximation",
    "we capture both the static limit as well as dynamic effects .",
    "this gives an energy dependent ( non - local in time ) interaction beyond the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "this has been studied in a similar model with promising results  @xcite , and with this work we want to adapt the idea into our model described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in other methods based on non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) and applied to qcls , electron - electron scattering has previously been implemented in a low order @xmath0 approximation employing a purely static screening model  @xcite .",
    "to simulate the periodic structure of the qcl , we use a product space of plane waves and confined states .",
    "the green s function evaluation provides us with the energy resolution of the states , labeled by state and @xmath1 index , at the cost of inverting the self - energy matrices at each @xmath1 and energy grid point .",
    "a number of elastic scattering processes as well as longitudinal optical phonon scattering is treated in this formalism at a high computational cost . adding a many - body term fully dependent on the polarization would increase the complexity by one order , a formidable task in this model , leading us to consider simpler schemes as done in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first the theory of the sppa is discussed and we show how it is implemented in the context of our formalism",
    ". then the dispersion of the plasmons is discussed as well as the exchange shift . in the last part a test structure is used to evaluate the effect of the inclusion of the new scattering mechanism",
    ". finally , we present the conclusions of our study .",
    "in thz quantum cascade simulations , the relevant sources of scattering , beside electrons , are interface roughness , impurities from donor atoms , acoustic and optical phonons as well as alloy composition .",
    "all these effects have already been implemented and details can be found in ref .",

    "the model discussed here employs a non - equilibrium green s function formalism where the system observables are extracted from the retarded and lesser parts of the green s function in the formalism of @xcite .",
    "these are solved using self - energies for the part of the hamiltonian that is non - diagonal in @xmath2 and solved through the dyson equation and the keldysh relation .    in this section",
    "we will describe how we formulate the self - energy expressions for the screened interaction in the single plasmon pole approximation ( sppa ) .",
    "first we will discuss how the conduction band is treated as an effective band in order to apply the named approximation .",
    "then we will describe how we formulate and also evaluate the coulomb matrix elements .",
    "after this we acquire the lesser and retarded part of the screened interaction before moving on to the actual construction of the self - energies .",
    "this is done in close correspondence to the treatment of phonons in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to keep the length of this section reasonable . to this treatment",
    "we will here add the necessary exchange part .",
    "before we move on to the next section where we test the model , we will also describe how the plasmon dispersion is treated .      in frequency space the retarded screened potential is given by its own dyson equation , given here as a matrix equation : @xmath3^{-1}}_{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{q},e)^{-1 } } \\mathbf{v(q)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath4 is the bare interaction as a function of the momentum wave vector , described in more detail below , and @xmath5 is the polarization as a function of momentum and energy @xmath6 .",
    "if we now assume an isotropic screening medium and that the dielectric function @xmath7 is not level dependent , we can write the approximated retarded screened potential as @xmath8 where @xmath9 now holds the matrix structure .",
    "we consider the dielectric function @xmath7 given by the lindhard formula  @xcite which is retarded due to poles in the lower half of the complex plane . while we assume an effective band for the screening , all other physical mechanisms are treated with full state dependence .    in this work",
    "we will assume a plasmon distribution in equilibrium with respect to the electron temperature .",
    "this approximation will ensure that energy is not dissipated from the distribution of non - equilibrium electrons .",
    "in addition , this assumption will allow us to link the lesser part of the screened interaction to the retarded through the fluctuation dissipation theorem  @xcite as @xmath10   \\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the ( bosonic ) plasmonic distribution function and @xmath12 is the spectral function , which can be written in terms of the retarded green s function leading to the rightmost expression",

    "form factors _ are expressed as @xmath19 where the integral is taken along the growth direction , which defines the quantization direction of the quasi-2d system and @xmath20 are the quantized states in the @xmath21-direction used as a basis for the simulation .",
    "the numerical integration is greatly simplified by expressing the wave functions as a truncated fourier series  @xcite .",
    "all form factors are then easily calculated and are thus available at a reasonable computational cost for all @xmath22 .",
    "these form factors will also be close to exact as the number of fourier components needed for the well behaved wave functions of the heterostructures is limited .",
    "we define the sppa following @xcite as @xmath23 where the effective plasmon pole is chosen to ensure that the approximation is correct both in the long wavelength @xmath24 the static limit , as thoroughly discussed in @xcite , and given in the two cases of screening dimensions as @xmath25 and @xmath26 where the plasma frequency is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the effective 2d and 3d carrier densities .",

    "the same treatment applied to phonons one can formulate expressions for the retarded and lesser self - energies . however the static term in the retarded interaction has to be taken into account .",
    "this is the exchange shift and it is crucial to preserve the limits of the sppa , static and long wavelength cases .",
    "according to standard feynmann rules we express the diagram for the screened interaction self - energy in the gw approximation  @xcite as @xmath40 where the times are now on the keldysh contour . using the langreth rules",
    "@xcite we can transform them to the real time axis .",
    "schematically we have for products structured as above the following rules : @xmath41 where the time arguments are implicit and are ordered as in the product in eq .  .",
    "at this point we make a rather drastic approximation and express the screened interaction in the sppa .",
    "the static term in the retarded screened interaction is present in the first and third term . in the first it gives rise to the exchange described below ,",
    "however in the third , it does not contribute as the retarded green s function , considered as a function of energy , only has poles in the lower imaginary half plane .",
    "closing the contour in the upper plane prevents contributions from this term .",
    "we can now proceed and formulate the self - energies for the screened interaction , and the treatment is analogous to that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for optical phonons , with the addition of the exchange term treated below . here",
    "we make the crucial assumption that the self - energies are functions of energy only , in contrast with the more computationally intensive approach of ref .",
    "@xcite that uses full energy and @xmath1-dependent terms . here",
    "the full @xmath1-dependence is replaced by an average contribution , by evaluating the scattering matrix elements for a set of typical values for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , as explained in detail in  @xcite .",

    "the factor @xmath47 is again the bose distribution where the electron temperature enters . in each term",
    "there is an average over all possible scattering angles .",
    "the scattering matrix elements are given as @xmath48 and the plus and minus variants used above comes from the choice of typical values for the evaluation . in our @xmath1-independent approximation we put @xmath49 with @xmath50 takes the level difference properly into account for all combinations of indices .",
    "@xmath51 is a representative value chosen to give a similar scattering rate compared to the case of thermalised subbands at the given lattice temperature .",
    "as the hartree - fock self - energies are local in time they depend only on the difference in coordinates , and the exchange term is normally evaluated directly from the diagrammatic rules to be @xmath52 which simplifies if only the difference in time matters and we find @xmath53 where we moved the coulomb matrix elements out of the sum over @xmath2 in order to do the sum and reach the final 2d sheet densities @xmath54 .",
    "the factor of 1/2 appears as we do not sum over spin for the exchange self - energy .",
    "the @xmath55 is now an angle averaged quantity over the possible angles between @xmath2 and @xmath56 , where we again use typical values for @xmath42 and @xmath44 .",
    "our model , without electron - electron scattering has been previously tested successfully on superlattices and qcl heterostructures  @xcite .",

    "the periodic structure is displayed in fig .",

    "these type of four - well thz qcl structures have previously been troublesome to simulate , see for example  @xcite , due to a pre - peak feature which is not recovered experimentally , at least not to the same extent as in the simulations . in theory , a lot more weight is put on the pre - peak at the cost of a lower main peak , compared to the opposite situation in experiments .",
    "this design was also tested experimentally for the different doping concentrations , which makes it ideal as we want to study the impact of electron - electron interaction .",

    "the lack of convergence is attributed to artificially low lifetimes of the states due to the lack of important scattering mechanisms . in order to reach convergence in the self - consistent process",
    ", the energy resolution would have to be increased significantly .",
    "this is currently being investigated but the higher numerical complexity prevents us from showing any results here .",
    "the pre - peak feature occurs at a low bias , before there is sufficient gain to start laser operation and it indicates that some important scattering is missing in the model as this is not the behavior seen in experiments . for sample",
    "a , a threshold current of 175 a/@xmath58 is observed for 10 k heatsink temperature and this gradually increases to 430 a/@xmath58 for the maximum operating temperature .",

    "[ figcurr ] shows simulations with 2d screening at a lattice temperature of 100k , and the current continues off the scale and is much too large compared to the experimental data .",

    "( [ eeff2d]-[eeff3d ] ) .",
    "this effectively gives additional screening for the 3d case as the plasmon quanta , limited downwards by the plasma energy , always have to be exchanged with the collective modes that are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium . for the 2d case , there is nothing limiting the system from exchanging plasmons with vanishing energy , making both the occupation factor in eqs .",

    "this , together with the observation that the 2d screening model gives an unrealistic current contribution , is the reason for focusing the rest of our discussion on the 3d screening model .",
    "a few different cases are displayed in fig .",

    "the agreement is reasonable except for the @xmath61 for sample a. for sample b the agreement appears to be better but as we consider off - state current and on - state current probably is higher , this might be too large as well .",
    "the experimental decrease in current with lattice temperature is thus not seen in the simulations . the way we interpret",
    "this is that the possibility of exchanging plasmons with the environment opens up new transport channels for the electrons , and that this effect actually is larger than the hypothesized effect of increased dephasing which would decrease the tunneling currents , such as the parasitic resonance at the ndr peak .",
