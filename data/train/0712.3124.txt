    "knowledge of the precise relationship between the fixed order approach  based on the collinear factorization formula and the dglap equation@xcite  and the small-@xmath6 resummed ones  based on the high - energy factorization formula  @xcite and the bfkl equation@xcite  is of course needed for a unified picture of small-@xmath6 physics , e.g. , to provide quantitatively accurate predictions in the small-@xmath6 region , which will be explored by next - generation colliders .",

    "the main tool of our analysis  @xcite was the generalization to @xmath11 dimensions of the @xmath2-representation of the gluon density  a mellin representation of the bfkl solution in which @xmath2 is conjugate to @xmath12 . while for @xmath13",
    "the running - coupling bfkl equation is a differential equation in @xmath2 , for @xmath14 it becomes a finite - difference equation , whose solution , however , is not unambiguously determined and has been computed by using sometimes rather formal manipulations . despite the sensible physical meaning of the procedure and of its results , from a mathematical point of view some steps of our method are not fully proven .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have at least an explicit example that could confirm our method of solution of the finite - difference equation , especially in view of its application to compute the anomalous dimensions at full nl@xmath6 accuracy .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to devise a non - trivial , physically motivated and solvable model which : _ 1 ) _ by providing explicit solutions , illustrates the main qualitative features of the real qcd case ; _ 2 ) _ can clarify the less understood aspects of the procedure developed in  @xcite and verify the correctness of its results .",
