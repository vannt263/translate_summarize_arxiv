    "on several occasions at the arnold sommerfeld institute at clausthal ( and elsewhere ) i have addressed the field problem and the symmetry problem in the theory of superselection sectors of low - dimensional models of quantized fields @xcite .",
    "the field problem raises the question whether the algebra of physical observables can be embedded into a field algebra containing sufficiently many charged fields to generate from the vacuum all superselection sectors of the observables .",
    "the identification of a sensible class of gauge symmetries in a given model with braid group statistics ( which precludes symmetry groups ) constitutes the symmetry problem .",
    "the field problem can always be solved by a canonical construction of intertwining field operators , which was introduced in @xcite and called the `` reduced field bundle '' ( with commutation relations in the form of an exchange algebra ) .",
    "yet , i have myself rejected this answer as a useful candidate for the ambient field algebra .",
    "the reason was the apparent absence of a decent symmetry under which the reduced field bundle transforms , with the observables as the invariants ( the `` gauge principle '' ) .",
    "a main point in this report is the observation that the reduced field bundle does possess a symmetry which i have previously overlooked .",
    "in fact , it is invariant under the action of a weak c * hopf algebra .",
    "weak c * hopf algebras @xcite ( and related objects @xcite ) are comparatively conservative generalizations of finite symmetry groups .",
    "the coproduct is non - commutative and does not map the unit operator onto the unit operator . unlike quantum groups @xcite , however , it preserves the @xmath0-structure , and unlike quasi quantum groups @xcite , it is coassociative . unlike the combinatorial concept of a paragroup @xcite , and unlike my personal attempts with c * symmetries @xcite , its action on the field algebra is determined by a linear transformation law on finite tensor multiplets of charged fields .",
    "weak c * hopf symmetries are by no means restrained to the reduced field bundle .",
    "they are rather the natural symmetry concept associated with finite index subfactors of depth 2 .",
    "if such a subfactor is irreducible , then the symmetry is in fact a c * hopf algebra ; so its `` weakness '' is precisely due to reducibility .",
    "the depth 2 condition has rather a technical meaning ( `` all irreducible components of the subfactor @xmath1 are already contained in @xmath2 '' ) , and in the case of irreducible subfactors becomes a simple structural property ( `` @xmath3 is a factor '' ) . here",
    "@xmath4 is the second jones extension of @xmath2 .",
    "weak c * hopf algebras possess unitary matrix representations .",
    "the size of the corresponding multiplets ( of charged fields ) is , in contrast to the true hopf case , different from the quantum dimension of the corresponding bimodule ( statistical dimension of the associated superselection sector ) .",
    "consequently , the obstruction against non - integer quantum ( or statistical ) dimensions which seemed always inherent to c * symmetries , is absent for weak c * hopf symmetries .",
    "the following defining system of axioms for weak c * hopf algebras is due to ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we also refer for further details .",
    "our emphasis here is on the departure from true c * hopf algebras .",
    "a a finite dimensional weak c * hopf algebra is a c * algebra with @xmath5 ( hence a direct sum of matrix rings ) with the additional structures coproduct , counit and antipode .",
    "the coproduct is a coassociative @xmath0-homomorphism @xmath6 .",
    "the counit is a positive linear map @xmath7 and satisfies the compatibility condition with the coproduct : @xmath8 .",
    "the antipode is a complex - linear anti - homomorphism and anti - cohomomorphism @xmath9 ( i.e. , it reverts the order of the product and of the coproduct ) , and is inverted by the @xmath0-structure : @xmath10 .",
    "b the three axioms in the left column hold , as opposed to the corresponding three stronger axioms for true c * hopf algebras in the right column .",
    "@xmath11 ( we use the shorthand notation @xmath12 for the expansion of @xmath13 . ) along with the three weak axioms , either of the three stronger axioms implies the other two .",
    "therefore these three axioms for true c * hopf algebras can not be independently relaxed .",
    "c the dual @xmath14 is defined by the linear maps @xmath15 .",
    "the structure data of @xmath16 are canonically dualized by the pairing , and by @xmath17 the dual is given a @xmath0-structure .",
    "@xmath14 with data @xmath18 and @xmath0 is again a weak c * hopf algebra .",
    "d a ( left ) action of a weak c * hopf algebra @xmath16 on a c * algebra @xmath19 is a unital algebra homomorphism from @xmath16 into the linear maps of @xmath19 into @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath20 , satisfying @xmath21 an element @xmath22 of @xmath19 is called invariant under the action , if @xmath23 .",

    "a @xcite the subfactor @xmath28 has finite index if and only if there is a homomorphism @xmath29 ( the conjugate ) and a `` standard '' pair of isometries @xmath30 , @xmath31 satisfying @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the canonical and dual canonical endomorphisms of @xmath19 and @xmath25 , respectively , associated with the subfactor .",

    "the theory is local if the local algebras associated with two regions at space - like distance commute with each other .",
    "a theory of observables has to be local .",
    "the following results can be found in full detail in @xcite .",
    "b a field extension of a theory of observables @xmath100 is a ( relatively local , but possibly nonlocal ) isotonous net @xmath101 such that for every region , @xmath99 is a subfactor of @xmath102 . assuming the existence of a conditional expectation @xmath103 which preserves the localization and leaves the vacuum state invariant ( an unbroken global symmetry in the broadest sense ) , the dual canonical endomorphism @xmath40 associated with a single local subfactor @xmath104 extends to a covariant endomorphism @xmath40 of the entire net of observables @xmath100 .",
    "the latter is trivial on observables at space - like distance from @xmath98 , and is hence a dhr endomorphism @xcite localized in @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath40 is equivalent to the representation of @xmath100 on the vacuum hilbert space of @xmath101 , and its subsectors are precisely those superselection charges of @xmath100 for which there are charged fields within the ambient net @xmath101 .",
    "c conversely , every `` dhr canonical triple '' @xmath39 determines , in terms of observable data , a field extension @xmath101 with an unbroken global symmetry . here @xmath40 is a dhr endomorphism of @xmath100 localized in some region @xmath98 , @xmath37 and @xmath50 are isometries in @xmath99 , and the algebraic relations as in 3b hold with @xmath105 .",
    "the algebra @xmath106 is constructed from the triple as in 3b with @xmath107 , and the other local algebras are obtained from it by poincar or conformal covariance .",
    "it is a nontrivial result about this construction that the structural properties of the `` germinal '' local subfactor @xmath104 propagate to every other local subfactor . in the sequel ,",
    "statements about the net are understood to hold for every local subfactor .",
    "the simple eigenvalue condition @xmath108 on the statistics operator @xmath109 of @xmath40 decides whether the net @xmath101 resulting from the triple is local or not .",
    "d a `` cheap '' way to obtain dhr canonical triples is the following .",
    "for any dhr endomorphism @xmath110 of @xmath100 ( with finite statistics ) there is a standard pair ( cf .",
    "3a ) of isometries @xmath37 and @xmath111 in @xmath100 such that @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath105 .",
    "thus @xmath114 is a dhr canonical triple .",
    "therefore , every dhr sector @xmath110 defines a corresponding field extension @xmath115 . if @xmath110 is localized in @xmath98 , then @xmath116 is the jones extension of @xmath107 by its subfactor @xmath117 .",
    "the local subfactors have depth 2 if and only if all subsectors of @xmath118 are already contained in @xmath110 .    by the eigenvalue condition ( cf .",
    "c ) , the nets @xmath115 are always nonlocal ( unless @xmath110 is an automorphism and consequently @xmath119 ) .",
    "since this statement is not in @xcite , we provide the argument here .",
    "one applies the standard left - inverse @xmath120 of @xmath110 to the eigenvalue condition .",
    "but @xmath121 is an isometry while , by the statistics calculus @xcite , @xmath122 differs from an isometry by the statistics parameter of @xmath110 which is @xmath123 times a unitary .",
    "therefore , equality can hold only if @xmath124 .",
    "e this `` cheap '' construction does not provide all dhr canonical triples .",
    "notably an irreducible extension with an outer action of a compact gauge group such that the observables are the fixed points can not be of this type .",
    "e.g. , provided all dhr sectors of @xmath100 have permutation group statistics , the doplicher - roberts construction @xcite determines a graded local extension with a compact gauge group .",
    "its dual canonical endomorphism @xmath125 contains every irreducible dhr sector with multiplicity @xmath61 equal to its statistical dimension @xmath126 .",
    "the isometry @xmath50 encodes the clebsch - gordan coefficients of the gauge group .",
    "in a quantum field theory with superselection sectors , it is desirable to have a field algebra of charged fields which generate all charged sectors from the vacuum , and a gauge symmetry acting on the fields with the observables as fixpoints . in order to be of practical use , the transformation law for the fields should be sufficiently simple and concrete .",
    "these demands favour field extensions with weak c * hopf symmetry which have transformation laws with finite multiplets , while in low dimensions it is in general inconsistent to ask for true c * hopf symmetry .",
    "a in order to find field extensions of a given ( rational ) local quantum field theory of observables @xmath100 which have a weak c * hopf symmetry , one has to look for dhr canonical triples @xmath39 such that the resulting local subfactors have depth 2 .",
    "b an immediate possibility in rational models is to choose @xmath127 the direct sum of all irreducible dhr sectors of @xmath100 with multiplicity one , and to proceed as in 4d . by construction and",
    "since @xmath128 is self - conjugate , the resulting local subfactor @xmath104 is isomorphic to @xmath129 .",
    "an explicit unitary equivalence shows @xcite that the same holds for the reduced field bundle extension @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , the reduced field bundle equals the extension of @xmath100 by @xmath128 .",
    "it has depth 2 and a self - dual weak c * hopf symmetry @xmath16 . as algebras , @xmath16 and @xmath14 are both isomorphic to the relative commutant @xmath131 .",
    "the latter is a sum of matrix rings @xmath132 labelled by the dhr sectors ( `` charges '' ) of @xmath100 , with @xmath133 equal to their multiplicities within @xmath134 .",
    "the irreducible multiplets @xmath78 ( cf .",
    "3d ) coincide with the charged operators @xmath135 spanning the reduced field bundle as defined in @xcite .",
    "averaging over the symmetry by the conditional expectation @xmath86 ( cf .",
    "3 ) yields the invariant elements @xmath136 where the sum extends over all edges of trivial charge .",
    "these are precisely the observables @xmath137 on the extended hilbert space .",
    "c if all dhr sectors of @xmath100 have integer statistical dimension , another natural choice is @xmath138 ( @xmath139 , @xmath140 ) .",
    "this choice is possible whenever the observables are given as the fixed points of another net @xmath101 under a finite gauge group , e.g. , the graded local doplicher - roberts extension in the case of permutation group statistics , cf .",
    "4e .    in the diagram below ,",
    "the first row is a jones sequence due to the gauge symmetry , and so is the second row by definition of @xmath141 .",
    "since an alternating subsequence of a jones sequence is again a jones sequence , the two obvious vertical equalities imply the third : @xmath142 it follows that the extension @xmath141 of @xmath100 by @xmath143 equals the extension of @xmath101 by @xmath100 , which in turn equals the crossed product of @xmath101 by its gauge group @xmath144 .",
    "d if all sectors of @xmath100 are simple , then @xmath145 coincides with @xmath128 .",
    "there is an anyonic field extension @xmath101 with an abelian symmetry group such that the dual canonical endomorphism is @xmath146 . by combination of b and c ,",
    "the reduced field bundle is a crossed product of the anyonic extension by its abelian gauge group .",
    "e in the general case with integer statistical dimensions , the jones extension @xmath141 of @xmath100 by @xmath143 is to the same extent `` larger '' than @xmath130 as @xmath143 is `` smaller '' than @xmath147 .",
    "clearly , one has no inclusion as algebras but rather a compression by an appropriate projection which selects @xmath148 .",
    "f by combination of c and e , if the sectors of @xmath100 have permutation group statistics , then the reduced field bundle is a compression of the crossed product of the doplicher - roberts graded local field algebra by its gauge group .",
    "the paragroups assocciated with subfactors of finite index and depth 2 are weak c * hopf algebras .",
    "weak c * hopf algebras therefore reconcile the generalized symmetry notions due to ocneanu and due to kac and drinfeld .",
    "they arise as symmetries in quantum field theoretical models whenever the local subfactors `` observables @xmath149 fields '' have depth 2 ( the condition of finite index may presumably be relaxed ) .    field extensions with global weak c * hopf symmetries are encoded in terms of the observables by depth 2 dhr canonical triples @xmath39",
    ". an obvious and not very subtle class of such extensions , including the reduced field bundle , is described in 4d .",
    "relations between various such extensions are clarified .",
    "notably if the observables are the fixed points under a finite nonabelian gauge group acting on a given field net , it is made clear in which sense the reduced field bundle exceeds the given field net ( it corresponds to its crossed product by the gauge group ) , and in which sense it is smaller than the former ( it is a compression which removes the gauge multiplicities ) .    for a given theory there may exist other ( and more `` economic '' as far as the field problem is concerned ) dhr canonical triples which are not of the form described in 4d .",
    "the corresponding field extensions have a chance of being local or graded local and are therefore _ a priori _ more interesting than those `` cheap '' ones . among them",
    "are the doplicher - roberts reconstruction in four dimensions , as well as some examples in chiral models ( related to conformal embeddings ) which generate only a subset of the superselection sectors of a given model .",
    "since we know of no systematic way to construct such extensions , and notably we do not have a direct criterium on the canonical triple which ensures depth 2 , we refrain from discussing this important issue in this report .",
    "the weakness of the hopf structure reflects the reducibility of the local inclusions of gauge invariants among the fields .",
    "according to 3e , this feature is due to a nontrivial part of the quantum symmetry acting innerly on the field algebra .",
    "the implementing operators lie in the intersection of all local field algebras and commute with the observables .",
    "in the `` regular '' case 5c with a finite gauge group , they are the global implementers of the gauge group , and in the reduced field bundle case 5b , they are the source and range projections going along with the charged operators @xcite .",
    "these operators are redundant in order to solve the field problem , in the sense that they do not have any effect on the observables .",
    "furthermore , they mix up local and global concepts , albeit on the unobservable level of charged fields .",
    "on the other hand , depth 2 and therefore a linear transformation law with finite dimensional symmetry tensors require their presence .",
    "we consider these peculiar field operators as the price to be paid for a decent symmetry acting on the charge carrying fields .",
