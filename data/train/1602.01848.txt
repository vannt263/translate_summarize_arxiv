    "when a unicellular organism divides , it allocates its cellular resources ( proteins , dna , etc . ) to its newborn daughter cells . though the parent cell often distributes many of these resources equally ( as occurs in prokaryotes like _ escherichia coli _ or eukaryotes like _ schizosaccharomyces pombe _ ) , there are exceptions .",
    "for example , the yeast _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ divides by budding , which results in the budded daughter cell inheriting a smaller volume . in other cases",
    "this asymmetric allocation serves a more obvious purpose , as when a parent cell actively segregates its damaged proteins into one of its ( ill - fated ) daughter cells @xcite to ensure the other survives or when a mother cell keeps most of its stores of a scarce resource so that it may continue to proliferate @xcite .",
    "whether it be volume , proteins or another resource , the population - level distribution for a given resource tends to stabilize over successive generations and the amount of symmetry or asymmetry in the division of that resource nontrivially affects the stable distribution s statistical properties .",
    "while in previous studies we focused ( theoretically and experimentally ) on the correlations between various cell cycle variables @xcite , we devote this study to a quantitative , statistical analysis of stable resource distributions .",
    "assuming that every cell in the population attempts to accrue resources according to a species - specific growth policy that takes into account the initial amount of the resource at birth , @xmath0 , and specifies the desired ( pre - division ) amount @xmath1 , we find the conditions under which a unique stable resource distribution exists and study its properties .",
    "in addition , we allow for multiplicative and additive noise during growth ( see sec . [ sec : model_spec ] ) and assume that the asymmetry ratio @xmath2 ( the ratio of the resources allocated to the two offspring ) is fixed @xcite and leave the more general case to app .",

    "more formally , we show that the distribution for the amount of resources a cell born into the @xmath3th generation has at birth , @xmath4 , evolves into the distribution for the next generation @xmath5 according to an ( integral ) master equation ( see sec .",

    "[ app : generations_vs_time ] ) .    given the abundance of recent studies experimentally probing cell size distributions by tracking cell volume at the single - cell level , both for symmetrically dividing cells @xcite and asymmetrically dividing cells @xcite , we couch the majority of our discussion of the stable resource distribution in terms of the cell volume distribution in symmetrically- or asymmetrically - dividing cells .",

    "we begin building our stochastic model by discussing how cells of the asymmetrically - dividing yeast _ s. cerevisiae _ grow and divide . an @xmath3th generation cell born with volume",
    "@xmath17 will grow exponentially in time @xcite to a fully - grown size @xmath12 , at which point the daughter cell buds off the mother cell ( note that for organisms like _ e. coli _ which divide symmetrically , we would say the original `` mother '' cell produces two `` daughters '' ) .",
    "since volume is conserved , the birth volumes of the mother and daughter cells , which we denote by @xmath15 and @xmath14 , must add up to @xmath12 ,    @xmath18    both volumes contribute to the birth volume distribution for the next generation , @xmath5 .",

    "some of our results hold for arbitrary policies , but we focus mostly on the class of affine linear policies ,    @xmath20    in which the cell adds a constant volume @xmath21 ( independent of initial size ) to its initial volume ( weighted by a dimensionless control coefficient @xmath22 ) during growth .",
    "we should note this is a special case of a more general class of processes first considered from a thoroughly mathematical perspective in a series of papers ( refs . @xcite and @xcite ) by kesten in the 1970s . as is argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can always treat the affine linear policy as the first - order taylor expansion of a nonlinear policy about the typical cell size .",

    "[ sec : proof ] , this policy results in an inherently unstable population .",
    "the second case , the threshold or critical size policy @xcite , arises in the limit as @xmath27 ,    @xmath28    as the name implies , under this policy the cells divide when they grow to a specific critical size @xmath21 , eliminating correlations between initial and final cell size and leading to a narrow stable distribution",
    ". however , this lack of correlation stands in contrast to experiment : studies in both bacteria @xcite and yeast @xcite suggest that final size is actually correlated with initial size .    the third case , known as the incremental policy @xcite , sits between the threshold and timer policies ,    @xmath29    a cell following this policy attempts to increase its birth volume by a set amount @xmath21 .",
    "the molecular mechanism behind this policy is not fully understood @xcite .",
    "this policy is also appropriate in the case of damage control , as we show in the next section .",
    "now to carry out any given policy , the cell must grow exponentially for a time @xmath30 related to @xmath31 by    @xmath32    in reality , the cells can not grow for precisely this time and so their actual fully - grown volume is affected by noise .",
    "the exponential dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath30 ( eq . [ eq : growth_time ] ) then implies that errors in the growth time give rise to multiplicative noise ,    @xmath33    where @xmath34 ( superscript @xmath35 for `` noise '' ) is the growth timing error .",
    "we can also allow for additive noise , @xmath36 , in which case our noisy growth model becomes    @xmath37    we should also note that , depending on how careful we are in choosing @xmath7 and the distributions for the noise parameters , this model allows for cell volume to _ decrease _ ; however , given the low magnitude of noise we consider , the probability for this scenario is small enough to be negligible ( see table [ table : moment_comparison ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : stable_distribution_figure ] ) .",
    "after the cell reaches its final volume @xmath12 , we assume it divides such that @xmath38 , where the asymmetry ratio @xmath39 is always the same . combining this assumption with volume conservation ( eq . [ eq : conservation_law ] ) , we can write the post - division mother and daughter volumes directly in terms of the fully - grown cell volume :    @xmath40    note that we can go from @xmath15 to @xmath14 by taking @xmath41 , so in what follows it suffices to give the results for @xmath15 , from which one can obtain the results for @xmath14 via this transformation .",
    "this symmetry under relabeling mothers and daughters must hold for all our population - level results .",
    "we also consider how symmetrically - dividing cells can control their levels of damaged proteins by dividing these undesirable proteins asymmetrically between their daughter cells .",
    "assuming the damaged proteins are not autocatalytic , we can describe the accrual of damaged proteins in a cell , @xmath42 , by a volume - dependent rate @xmath43 , such that    @xmath44    given that both the mechanisms that result in damaged proteins ( e.g. environmental radiation or pollution ) and the cell volume itself are stochastic , it follows that the rate of damage is also stochastic .",

[ eq : eigenvalue_equation ] ) . evidently the stable distributions @xmath68 are eigenfunctions of the linear operator @xmath69 with eigenvalue 1 . however",
    ", finding analytic expressions for these eigenfunctions is difficult in practice : even if we were to consider only additive gaussian noise , @xmath70 , the resulting form of the kernel ( eq .

    "again , the immediate ansatz ( a mixture of two log - normals ) is not exactly a solution , but is approximately correct for @xmath74 @xcite .    though casting the problem in terms of a homogeneous fredholm integral equation of the second kind does not give us the ability to analytically construct stable distributions",

    "it is apparent that    @xmath75    hence the constant function @xmath76 is a left eigenfunction of our kernel with eigenvalue @xmath77 .",
    "thus we know that @xmath77 is an eigenvalue of the adjoint of the kernel , which implies that it is also an eigenvalue of the kernel itself , and so we know that our linear operator admits at least one right eigenfunction with eigenvalue 1",

    "[ eq : eigenvalue_equation ] admits at least one solution , it could be the case that none of these solutions can actually be considered a _ probability distribution_. there are two possible issues : first , there may not be any non - negative eigenfunctions ( i.e. eigenfunctions @xmath78 such that @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath0 ) and second , should a non - negative eigenfunction exist , it may not be normalizable in the @xmath81 sense .",
    "the issue of normalizability arises due to the fact that the stable distribution @xmath68 is defined on the infinite domain @xmath82 ; the problem vanishes in the discrete case ( finding the stable distribution for a markov chain ) .",

    "moreover , since the only parameter in the system with units of volume is @xmath0 itself , it follows from dimensional analysis that this is the _",

    "thus the timer model is inherently unstable .",

    "assuming there exists a finite ( nonzero ) number of probability distributions satisfying eq .",

    "[ app : discretization ] , we can construct @xmath99 such that it is a non - negative , connected stochastic matrix .",
    "thus it follows from the perron - frobenius theorem that 1 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath99 and its corresponding eigenvector is unique and non - negative .",
    "moreover , since 1 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath99 , the system is guaranteed to converge to a unique , stable distribution over successive generations .    while it may appear that a similar argument would also prove the _ existence _ of the stable distribution , the situation is more nuanced . in order for eq .",
    "[ eq : discrete_eigenvalue_equation ] to be a good approximation of the continuous case , the probability for a cell to be in the overflow bin ( @xmath100 ) , i.e. the last element of @xmath101 , must decay to zero as @xmath102 .",
    "however , this is not _ a priori _ guaranteed ; indeed , for unstable systems , the probability for being in the last bin remains finite even as we increase @xmath92 , whereas in stable systems we do in fact see the overflow probability decay with @xmath92 .",
    "thus by checking the cutoff dependence of the overflow probability in the discretized problem , we can attempt to numerically determine whether the continuous problem ( eq . [ eq : eigenvalue_equation ] ) admits a stable distribution , as we illustrate in fig . [",

    "though the numerical method for addressing the question of existence can be useful , we would prefer to formally answer the question with functional analysis . unfortunately , the infinite domain over which the distribution is defined complicates the standard approaches .",

    "<S> we consider a class of biologically - motivated stochastic processes in which a unicellular organism divides its resources ( volume or damaged proteins , in particular ) symmetrically or asymmetrically between its progeny . assuming the final amount of the resource is controlled by a growth policy and subject to additive and multiplicative noise , we derive the `` master equation '' describing how the resource distribution evolves over subsequent generations and use it to study the properties of stable resource distributions . we find conditions under which a unique stable resource distribution exists and calculate its moments for the class of _ affine linear _ growth policies . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we apply an asymptotic analysis to elucidate the conditions under which the stable distribution ( when it exists ) has a power - law tail . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the results of this asymptotic analysis along with the moment equations to draw a stability phase diagram for the system that reveals the counterintuitive result that asymmetry serves to increase stability while at the same time widening the stable distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss how cells can divide damaged proteins asymmetrically between their progeny as a form of damage control . in the appendix , motivated by the asymmetric division of cell volume in _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ , we extend our results to the case wherein mother and daughter cells follow different growth policies . </S>"
