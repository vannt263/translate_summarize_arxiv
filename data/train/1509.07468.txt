    "the distinctive feature of this model is that the structure of equilibria is richer compared to its second order counterpart @xmath10 giving rise to more complicated patterns and dynamics .",

    "the function @xmath16 describes the pointwise state of the material or the fluid .",
    "the constant equilibria corresponding to the global minimum points @xmath17 of the potential @xmath18 are called the pure phases , whereas other configurations @xmath16 represent mixed states , and orbits connecting @xmath17 describe phase transitions .    to understand the formation of more complex patterns in layering phenomenaobserved for instance in concentrated soap solutions or metallic alloyssome nonlinear models for materials include second order derivatives in the energy functional .",
