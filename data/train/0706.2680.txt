    "this is the first of two lectures on a new technique for calculating the temperature equilibration rate between electrons and ions in a weakly to moderately coupled fully - ionized plasma , exact to leading and next - to - leading order in the plasma number density .",
    "this calculation was first performed in section  12 of ref .",
    "@xcite , a work whose primary focus was the charged particle stopping power in a plasma .",
    "this paper assumed familiarity with a number of field theory concepts , and section  12 relied heavily on the charged particle stopping power results derived in previous sections of that work .",
    "in contrast , these lectures will be self - contained .",
    "i will either derive or motivate the requisite field theory background for a complete reading of ref .",
    "@xcite , with an emphasis on some of the subtleties of the calculational techniques and the concepts behind them ( this lecture ) .",
    "more to the point , since the rate calculation stands on its own , it should be presented on its own ( the following lecture ) . indeed ,",
    "since the calculation of the rate is somewhat less involved than that of the stopping power , it more clearly illustrates the tools and concepts imported from field theory .",
    "in addition to clarifying the method of dimensional continuation , this lecture will place ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of more familiar and traditional approaches to the rate problem .",
    "in particular , i will show that dimensional continuation can be viewed as a systematic implementation of the approach based on convergent kinetic equations .",
    "finally , in in the next lecture , i will go on to derive the main result from section  12 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the rate coefficient ( [ bpsrate ] ) of this lecture . by working in the born approximation , and adopting the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite , i will derive this result in a much simpler manner than originally presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . while lectures  i  and  ii are self - contained , they are complementary and should be read as a unit . ) of this lecture .",
    "this would provide two independent calculations of the rate ( [ bpsrate ] ) , but alas , time does not permit these last three supplements . ]    the strategy employed by ref .",
    "@xcite , hereafter referred to as  bps , consists of two steps .",
    "first , we will find a dimensionless parameter in which to perform a _ controlled _ perturbative expansion of the rate , expanding to leading and next - to - leading order in this parameter .",
    "second , we will deploy a technique from quantum field theory that will allow us to calculate the coefficients of these leading and subleading terms _ exactly_. the exact leading order term is not very difficult to find , and has been known since the classic work of spitzer .",
    "the next - to - leading order term , on the other hand , was not known exactly until the recent bps calculation .",
    "the third - order term provides an estimate of the error of the calculation . when the plasma is weakly to moderately coupled",
    ", the error will be small and the rate will be approximated quite accurately by the first two terms of this expansion .    to calculate the expansion coefficients , we will exploit a field theory technique known as dimensional regularization ( or dimensional continuation , as i will call it here ) .",
    "this application of dimensional continuation is quite different from its intended purpose in the renormalization procedure of quantum field theory .",
    "dimensional continuation was originally developed as an elegant regularization scheme in which the fundamental symmetries of a field theory could be maintained while still rendering finite the otherwise infinite integrals that arise when calculating feynman diagrams .",
    "i will show how this technique can be used in a novel fashion to extract next - to - leading order physics that has , until now , remained inaccessible .",
    "in other words , i will show how dimensional continuation provides an exact result for the corresponding coulomb logarithm of the process in question .",
    "i will also take the opportunity to correct a small algebra mistake for the electron - ion equilibration rate presented in section  12 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the general formalism starts with a plasma composed of multiple species labeled by an index @xmath5 , the various species being delineated by of a common electric charge @xmath6 and a common mass @xmath7 . with @xmath8 fixed .",
    "while this simplifying assumption has its limitations , it facilitates the analytic calculation of the stopping power and temperature equilibration rate .",
    "however , one can take the @xmath8 to be fractional to mock - up ionization in a simple manner . or better yet , it should be possible to combine the bps results with models of the ionization effects . for a hot low-@xmath9 plasmas , such as a deuterium - tritium plasma during icf ignition ,",
    "the ions are likely to be fully ionized in any event , so this is not a serious restriction for clean thermonuclear burn with low-@xmath9 impurities . ]",
    "each species is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with itself at temperature @xmath10 with a spatially uniform number density @xmath11 .",
    "i will drop the subscript on the charge of the electron and write @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) , although the electron mass will be denoted by @xmath14 , and the number density and temperature of the electron plasma component by @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "i will use a lower case subscript @xmath17 to denote a single ion species of charge @xmath18 , mass @xmath19 , number density @xmath20 , and temperature @xmath21 .",
    "i will employ a capital - i subscript to denote properties that correspond to the collective set of ions , such as the total ion number density @xmath22 or a common ion temperature  @xmath23 .",
    "when equilibrium distributions are required in calculations , they are assumed to be maxwell - boltzmann , although a generalization to fermi - dirac statistics can be accomplished with more effort  @xcite .",
    "for problems involving hot thermonuclear burn , however , the fugacity is small and maxwell - boltzmann statistics is an accurate approximation .",
    "let @xmath24 denote rate at which the energy density of plasma species @xmath25 changes because of its coulomb interactions with another species @xmath5 ( the rate _ from _",
    "the @xmath25-species _ to _ the @xmath5-species ) .",
    "this rate is proportional to the temperature difference , and can be expressed by @xmath26 the sign convention in ( [ dedtei ] ) implies that when the rate coefficients @xmath27 are positive , then energy will flow from the hotter species to the cooler species , as it must . section  12 of bps used dimensional continuation to calculate the general rate coefficients @xmath27 in a weakly coupled , but otherwise arbitrary , plasma .",
    "for simplicity , we will not perform the general calculation until lecture  iii . in this and the following lecture ,",
    "we will concentrate on the energy exchange between electrons and ions only .",
    "since the electron mass @xmath14 is so much smaller than a typical ion mass  @xmath28 , the electrons will come into equilibrium first with temperature @xmath16 on some time scale  @xmath29 .",
    "the energy transfer rate among ions is a factor @xmath30 slower than the corresponding rate for electrons , and therefore the ions will equilibrate to a common temperature @xmath23 in a time @xmath31 .",
    "finally , as the electrons and ions exchange energy through coulomb interactions , these systems too will equilibrate on a time scale .",
    "consequently , one finds a hierarchy of time scales , and it indeed makes sense to consider the electron and ion systems as having distinct temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath23 , with subsequent equilibration between them . taking @xmath32 and @xmath33 in ( [ dedtei ] ) , and since the ions have a common temperature @xmath34 , the rate equation of interest is obtained by summing over the ion components of ( [ dedtei ] ) to give @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .      for reasons to be discussed shortly ,",
    "rationalized units are preferred for dimensional continuation , and i will employ this choice in all that follows .",
    "nonetheless , expression ( [ bpsrate ] ) is written in a manner that does not depend upon this choice : the debye wave number @xmath44 , and the plasma frequencies @xmath45 and @xmath50 can be calculated in your favorite units .",
    "for example , in gaussian units where the electric potential takes the form @xmath51 , the debye wave number and the plasma frequency of species @xmath5 are given by and . in the rationalized units employed here , the electric potential is given by @xmath52 , and we have @xmath53    \\omega_b^2 & = & \\frac{e_b^2\\ , n_b}{m_b } \\ .",
    "\\label{wbdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the square of the total debye wave number is @xmath54 , and the total debye wave length is @xmath55 .",
    "let us now consider an arbitrary plasma component of mass @xmath56 , which i will otherwise leave unspecified , and let @xmath57 denote the boltzmann distribution for this species .",
    "then the average ( kinetic ) energy density of this component is @xmath58 if we work to leading and next - to - leading order in the number density , calculating the energy exchange between plasma components will then involve keeping a tally only of the kinetic energy , as in ( [ ebkin ] ) .",
    "this is because the potential energy is higher order in the number density [ or more precisely , the potential energy is higher order in the plasma coupling @xmath59 , to be defined later in ( [ gdefa ] ) ] . as the system interacts with other plasma components through mutual coulomb interactions , it will loose or gain energy depending on the temperature gradients with other species , and the energy exchange rate",
    "is given by @xmath60 0.1 cm in contrast to ( [ dedtei ] ) and ( [ dedtei ] ) , for ease of notation i have temporarily dropped the plasma component subscripts on the rate , and i will keep with this convention until the final calculation presented in section  [ sec : calcleading ] .",
    "we see that the entire problem is bound up in calculating the rate of change @xmath61 from an appropriate kinetic equation that captures the relevant physics .",
    "as it turns out , however , there is a serious problem in performing all such calculation with the coulomb potential in three dimensions : the integrals in the kinetic equations diverge logarithmically , and they do so at both large and small distances .    for processes in which large - angle scattering is important , such as the charged particle stopping power",
    ", it is natural to use the boltzmann equation , which i will write in the abbreviated form @xmath62 \\ , \\label{besimp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the gradient in position space , and @xmath64 $ ] is the scattering kernel , whose precise form will not concern us until the next lecture .",
    "the gradient vanishes because of spatial uniformity , so we will set @xmath65 .",
    "the boltzmann equation was designed to account for the statistical effects of short - distance collisions , and although its original context was classical , quantum two - body scattering effects can easily be incorporated .",
    "in fact , since the scattering phase shifts @xmath66 are known analytically for the coulomb potential , ref .",
    "@xcite used this to calculate the two - body quantum corrections to all orders [ in the quantum parameter @xmath67 to be defined in ( [ etadef ] ) ] .",
    "the kernel @xmath64 $ ] therefore contains all short - distance or ultraviolet physics , for both classical and quantum scattering .",
    "however , ( in three spatial dimensions ) the coulomb potential is long - range , and the integrals in @xmath64 $ ] diverge in the infrared ; or equivalently , if we write the scattering kernel @xmath64 $ ] in terms of momentum integrals , the divergence appears at small values of momentum .",
    "this was not a problem in boltzmann s original formulation of ( [ besimp ] ) , since the coulomb potential was unknown at that time , and he modeled particle collisions in terms of hard - sphere scattering . in summary , the boltzmann equation gets the short - distance physics correct , including quantum two - body scattering , but it misses the infrared physics .",
    "the fact that the boltzmann equation misses the long - distance physics manifests itself as an infrared divergence in the scattering kernel @xmath64 $ ] , thereby rendering calculations meaningless ( unless we tame , or regularize , this divergence ) .    given that the boltzmann equation misses the long - distance or infrared ( ir ) physics ,",
    "we might be tempted to try the lenard - balescu equation , which i will write in the abbreviated form @xmath68 \\ , \\label{lbesimp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 $ ] is a scattering kernel whose exact form will be needed only in the next lecture .",
    "again , the gradient term will be set to zero because of spatial uniformity .",
    "the lenard - balescu equation takes the form of a fokker - plank equation , with the kernel @xmath69 $ ] chosen to capture the correct ir physics .",
    "however , for the coulomb potential ( in three spatial dimensions ) , the lenard - balescu equation misses the short - distance or ultraviolet ( uv ) physics , and this is manifested by a uv divergence in @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "the situation for the lenard - balescu equation is exactly reversed compared to that of the boltzmann equation .",
    "this is what ref .",
    "@xcite calls the `` complementarity '' of these two kinetic equations , and in the dimensional continuation procedure we will use this fact to our advantage .",
    "the rate equation ( [ dedtbe ] ) reduces to a one - dimensional integral over the entire range of physical length scales ( or momentum scales , if one so chooses ) , from zero all the way to infinity .",
    "trouble arises for the coulomb potential in three dimensions since the integral in question is logarithmically divergent at both integration limits .",
    "we must therefore regulate the integral in some manner .",
    "dimensional continuation is one such procedure , but there are others .",
    "this divergence problem was first worked around by simply cutting off the divergent integrals by hand , with the cutoffs themselves being chosen by physical arguments  ( rather than a calculation ) .",
    "the energy exchange rate we are considering is but an example of a larger class of problems involving characteristic , but disparate , length or energy scales in which the measured quantity of interest is ( logarithmically ) insensitive to the physics above and below these scales . for these problems ,",
    "the simplest and most intuitive regularization scheme is to replace the offending integration limits , _",
    "i.e. _ infinity and zero , by the finite and non - zero physical scales of the problem .",
    "these two scales then act as formal integration cutoffs , giving a finite logarithm of the ratio of the scales . furthermore , because the system is insensitive to the physics above and below the respective cutoffs , this procedure provides a physically meaningful result . expressed in terms of length , we will denote the long- and short - distance scales by @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and the integral over scales leads to a finite logarithm involving the ratio of the physical length scales , so that @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an easily determined prefactor with dimensions of energy density per unit time . as we shall see , a calculation to leading order in the number density is sufficient to provide the coefficient @xmath73 , while a next - to - leading order calculation is required to find the exact terms under the logarithm .    the problem with this regularization prescription , which i will call the _ heuristic scheme _",
    ", is that we can only estimate the values of the physical scales @xmath70 and @xmath71 to within factors of order one or so .",
    "for example , it is physically reasonable that the scale of the long distance cutoff in a plasma is set by a debye length , so that @xmath74 with @xmath75 being a dimensionless constant of order unity ; but what determines the exact value of @xmath75 ?",
    "in fact , how does arise naturally from the kinetic equations themselves , rather than simply being chosen by hand ? and should one use the total debye wave number @xmath1 , or just the contribution from the electrons @xmath44 ? the origin of the short distance cutoff @xmath71 is even less clear . in the extreme classical limit",
    ", we expect this scale to be set by the classical distance of closest approach @xmath76 between two colliding particles , so that .",
    ", as this involves a somewhat arbitrary choice in the thermal averaging procedure .",
    "] on the other hand , we expect quantum effects to dominate when @xmath76 becomes smaller than some thermal compton wavelength @xmath77 , with @xmath78 being a typical thermally averaged momentum transfer . in this case",
    "we expect @xmath79 .",
    "worse yet , the intermediate region in which neither classical nor quantum processes dominate is often realized in a weakly coupled plasma , and in this case it is even more obscure how one should choose @xmath71 .",
    "we must interpolate between the extreme classical and the extreme quantum scales , but in the literature the exact procedure is always somewhat _",
    "ad hoc_. for example , a common choice is to define @xmath80 to be the sum of the squares of the classical and quantum scales , so that @xmath81 i will have more to say about this in section  [ sec : ginside ] .",
    "the heuristic scheme forces us to choose the specific forms of @xmath70 and @xmath71 motivated by imprecise physical arguments or heuristic exercises , which leads us into the art of model building rather than systematic calculation .",
    "indeed , the very notation that we must _ choose _ a cutoff is misleading , since the physics itself must conspire to render all integrals finite .",
    "consequently , the heuristic method suffers from an unknown coefficient under the logarithm , and only the approximate value of the ratio @xmath82 can be determined with this method ( in fact , this ratio varies across an order of magnitude over models in the literature , rather than factors of two or three ) .",
    "as we shall see , determining the constant under the logarithm exactly is equivalent to determining the next - to - leading order term exactly ; therefore , models of the form ( [ ratemodel ] ) are accurate only to leading order , and no better .      rather than merely regulating the _ integrals _ in a rate derived from the kinetic equations , as with ( [ ratemodel ] ) , a more sophisticated approach involves regularizing the divergences in the",
    "_ kinetic equations _ themselves . in other words ,",
    "the _ theory _ itself is regularized , rather than a particular quantity being calculated within the theory .",
    "the method of dimensional continuation falls into this category , albeit with somewhat more subtle mathematical machinery than traditional approaches .",
    "these approaches , of which refs",
    ".  @xcite are good examples , are summarized and placed into a common framework by aono in ref .",
    "@xcite . as discussed in section  [ sec : problemwithproblem ] of this lecture , one can view the boltzmann and leonard - balescu equations as providing complementary physics since they both succeed and fail in complementary regimes .",
    "the boltzmann equation gets the short - distance physics correct , while the leonard - balescu equation captures the long - distance physics ; conversely , boltzmann and leonard - balescu miss the long- and short - distance physics , respectively .",
    "this complementarity motivates a class of kinetic equations of the form  @xcite @xmath83 + l[f ] - r[f ] \\ , \\label{convke}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 $ ] is a carefully chosen `` regulating kernel '' designed to subtract the long - distance divergence of the boltzmann equation and the short - distance divergence of the lenard - balescu equation . at the same time",
    ", the kernel @xmath84 $ ] must preserve the correct short - distance physics of the boltzmann equation and the correct long - distance physics of the lenard - balescu equation ( a minimal requirement of the regulating kernel @xmath84 $ ] is that it take a hippocratic oath to _ do no harm _ , at least to subleading order in the plasma coupling ) .",
    "each term on the right - hand - side of ( [ convke ] ) is separately divergent , but collectively they lead to a finite collision kernel if properly interpreted . ) should be separately regularized in some manner , rendering the individual kernels @xmath64 $ ] , @xmath69 $ ] , and @xmath84 $ ] separately finite : @xmath64 $ ] must be regulated at long - distances , @xmath69 $ ] at short - distances , and @xmath84 $ ] at both long- and short - distances .",
    "if this procedure is executed correctly , so that the long - distance divergences of @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] cancel , as do the short - distance divergences of @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath69 $ ] , both in a consistent fashion , then the entire right - hand - side of ( [ convke ] ) remains finite as the cutoffs are removed .",
    "if @xmath84 $ ] does not disturb the @xmath85 physics , then the convergent kinetic equation will be accurate to @xmath85 .",
    "i will have more to say about how one regulates long- and short - distances _ consistently _ in section  [ sec : lamb ] , and how this can be a quite non - trivial process .",
    "] as an example , gould and dewitt  @xcite regulated the long - distance divergence of the boltzmann equation by simply replacing the coulomb potential with a debye screened yukawa - like potential , @xmath86 where , as not to confuse symbols , i write @xmath87 as the base of the natural logarithm and @xmath88 as the electric charge . while ref .",
    "@xcite performed this operation by hand using physical arguments , one could easily introduce a kernel @xmath84 $ ] to do the same .    while the approach to convergent kinetic equations described by aono might appear to be more rigorous than the aforementioned model building approach of ( [ ratemodel ] ) , it is no more systematic : methods based on ( [ convke ] ) or its equivalent do not contain the ability to estimate their own error , _",
    "i.e. _ they can not determine their domain of applicability .",
    "there is nothing in the formalism of ( [ convke ] ) that keeps track of the plasma coupling constant , or the order to which we are working in this constant .",
    "indeed , one does not generally think of ( [ convke ] ) in terms of a perturbation theory .",
    "in contrast , ref .",
    "@xcite calculates the rate using a systematic expansion in the plasma number density , or more precisely , in a dimensionless plasma coupling parameter @xmath59 [ to be defined by ( [ gdefa ] ) and discussed at length in section  [ sec : eerate ] ] .",
    "although written in a disguised form , the bps rate coefficient ( [ bpsrate ] ) is an expansion to leading and next - to - leading order in the coupling parameter : the leading order term goes like @xmath89 , the next - to - leading order is proportional to @xmath90 , and the @xmath91 term provides an estimate of the error . translating the work of gould and dewitt  @xcite into the language of a perturbative expansion in a plasma coupling constant , it turns out that their result is valid to order @xmath90 and is in agreement with bps to this order .",
    "however , in their final result , gould and dewitt retain spurious higher order terms in @xmath92 .",
    "i call these terms `` spurious '' because ref",
    ".  @xcite did not calculate the full set of order @xmath92 terms , but only some of these terms .",
    "indeed , the notion of a systematic expansion in a small dimensionless parameter does not enter their calculational framework . as this example shows , convergent kinetic equations can be more accurate than the heuristic model building technique of the previous section , but one can not be sure of their accuracy until a comparison with a systematic calculation has been made , as with bps and ref .",
    "i will illustrate the main points of dimensional continuation with an example involving the modified bessel function @xmath93 , with an emphasis on analytic continuation and how this can be used to extract leading and next - to - leading order behavior .",
    "this example was first presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for pedagogical purposes it was also included in appendix  a of ref .",
    "this example contains all the essential features of dimensional continuation , but in a mathematically simple form , and while it is an imperfect analogy , as all analogies are , it is explicit in all its details .",
    "we will show that the modified bessel function @xmath93 has the expansion @xmath94 to leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath95 , with @xmath96 denoting euler s constant .",
    "this expansion is quite accurate for small values @xmath95 , with an error of order @xmath97 rather than @xmath95 for symmetry reasons .",
    "the asymptotic expansion ( [ kzerolonlo ] ) is a well known result  @xcite , but it is rather difficult to prove by conventional methods because of the non - analytic leading - log behavior .",
    "however , the method of dimensional continuation allows us to derive this result rather easily .",
    "the price one pays for this ease of derivation is that one must learn ( or recall ) a bit of mathematical machinery which , at first sight , seems unrelated to the problem at hand .",
    "we start with the general integral representation of the modified bessel functions @xcite , @xmath98 as the notation in ( [ knuint ] ) suggests , we can think of @xmath99 as the dimension of space and the integration variable @xmath100 as the wave number . in this analogy",

    "we can therefore think of @xmath99 in expression ( [ knuint ] ) as being a continuous real variable  , or indeed , a complex variable if circumstances warrant .",
    "similarly , for a real physical system written in the appropriate integral form , there is nothing in any law of physics that prevents us from interpreting the dimension of space @xmath99 as being a complex number .",

    "finite manipulations can then be performed , the divergent poles will cancel from physically measurable quantities , and afterward we can take @xmath99 to the appropriate integer dimension ( in this analogy we take @xmath106 , rather than @xmath107 as we do for the physics problem ) .",
    "let us first calculate the leading order in @xmath95 behavior of @xmath108 for positive and negative values of @xmath99 . for small positive values of @xmath95 , the leading order @xmath95-behavior can be obtained by replacing the exponential in ( [ knuint ] ) by one , _ except _ in the regions @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where the exponential is required for convergence .",

    "these radiative corrections effectively smear the point - like nature of the nucleus , thereby altering the atomic energy levels ( the electron no longer `` sees '' a pure coulomb potential ) .",
    "any possible number of photon exchanges with the nucleus are permitted , from a single high - energy photon ( hard / uv physics ) to many low - energy photons ( soft / ir physics ) , and this means there are two disparate but competing energy scales in the problem . in a manner similar to the coulomb energy - loss rate ( [ ratemodel ] ) , the lamb shift takes the form @xmath372 the uv scale is set by @xmath373 and the ir scale @xmath374 is set by the binding energy of the hydrogen atom @xmath375 to understand the origin of these scales , note that @xmath376 takes its value from the energy at which relativistic effects for the electron become important ( the rest - mass energy of the electron ) , while @xmath374 takes its value from the only low - energy scale in the problem ( namely , the binding energy of the atom ) .",
    "the soft photon ir interactions can be handled by nonrelativistic means , while the hard uv photons require a more complicated relativistic treatment .",
    "for this reason , bethe used the simpler nonrelativistic formalism , cutting his calculation off at the relativistic energy scale @xmath377 at which his formalism broke down .",

    "bethe found a logarithmic uv divergence , in the same way the lenard - balescu equation has a uv divergence , but he was able to regularize the infinity by applying a technique known as mass renormalization , thereby rendering his calculation finite .",

    "bethe s exact calculation of @xmath374 is akin to an exact calculation of @xmath70 in the rate problem .",
    "this , however , is a point where the analogy is not precise : bethe was able to exactly calculate @xmath374 through the regularization procedure of mass renormalization , which has no counterpart in plasma physics . on the other hand ,",
    "lyman spitzer was only able to estimate the value of the maximum impact parameter in the coulomb logarithm to be of order @xmath382 .",

    ", we can express ( [ lambscematic ] ) as @xmath383 where @xmath384 is the fine structure constant .",
    "bethe s calculation therefore gives @xmath385 or @xmath386 .",
    "bethe did not , however , calculate the _ exact _ coefficient under the logarithm . since his calculation broke down at relativistic energies , he used the somewhat _ ad hoc _ value ( rather than some multiple thereof ) for the uv cutoff .",
    "it turns out that the high energy corrections to ( [ delebethe ] ) are rather small , so bethe s result was perhaps more accurate than warranted .",
    "since bethe only estimated the maximum energy cutoff , his result ( [ delebethe ] ) is only accurate to leading order in @xmath387 , and the constant under the logarithm required a more accurate treatment .",
    "the analogy further continues : bethe calculated the lamb shift to leading order , just as spitzer calculated the coulomb logarithm to leading order .",
    "both calculations found the correct coefficient in front of the logarithm , and the order of magnitude of the argument of the logarithm .",
    "these calculations failed to extract the exact constant under the logarithm , although bethe managed to find the exact expression for the low - energy cutoff . in this sense , bethe is the spitzer of the lamb shift .    shortly after this , r.  feynman and j.  schwinger independently calculated the high energy contribution using their respective relativistically covariant formalisms , and their calculations were exact to leading and next - to - leading order in @xmath387 . after adding their contribution of the high energy corrections to bethe s low energy form , the calculation of the lamb shift was complete and the constant under the logarithm was fully determined .",
    "or so it would seem .",
    "simultaneously , j.  french and v.  weisskopf completed an independent calculation of the lamb shift that disagreed with feynman - schwinger , albeit only slightly in the coefficient under the logarithm .",
    "the plot thickened as yet another calculation of the lamb shift was completed that agreed with french - weisskopf , this time from n.  kroll and lamb himself .",
    "so now we seem to have a real problem : the schwinger - feynman calculations agree with each other , but disagree with the french - weisskopf and kroll - lamb calculations .",
    "schwinger and feynman had developed independent but equivalent formalisms that manifestly exhibited the relativistic covariance of the theory , while the other four had used a cumbersome formalism developed in the 1930 s ( now called _ old - fashioned perturbation theory _ ) . as it turns out ,",
    "schwinger and feynman had made the same subtle mistake , and weisskopf s calculation was correct .",
    "the contribution to the lamb shift we have been considering has the form @xmath388 where @xmath389 is bethe s low energy result ( [ kbethe ] ) . as with the bps coulomb logarithm",
    ", we can bring the additive constant in ( [ lambcorrect ] ) inside the logarithm , and using ( [ e0 ] ) we can express ( [ lambcorrect ] ) as @xmath390 in terms of the bethe s coefficient @xmath391 of ( [ delebethe ] ) , the complete lamb shift coefficient is ( apart from the photon vacuum polarization and the electron dipole moment corrections , which were mentioned in footnote  [ foot : othercorrections ] , but will not concern us further ) .",
    "french spent the next year tracing down the origins of the discrepancy between the calculations .",
    "he could not find an error in the feynman - schwinger high energy calculation , nor was there an error in bethe s low energy calculation .",
    "instead , the error was in the way the high - energy calculation of feynman - schwinger was `` joined '' onto the low - energy result of bethe .",
    "the high - energy calculation is also infinite and in need of regularization , but this time it contains an ir divergence .",
    "this is analogous to the boltzmann equation containing the correct short - distance physics , but nonetheless diverging at long distances .",
    "therefore , feynman - schwinger had to introduce an intermediate step in which they regulated their high energy theories in the infrared .",
    "they chose to do this by assigning a small mass to the photon , and then taking this mass to zero at the end of the calculation . while this is a common ir regularization scheme in qed , it is incommensurate with bethe s regularization scheme in his low energy calculation , where he used a simple cutoff procedure in a high - energy integral .",

    "@xcite of this lecture , which i have quoted in the bibliography in its entirety .",
    "that one must calculate the large and small scales in exactly the same manner is not a minor point , as underscored by the stature of the physicists who failed to realize its importance when they first calculated the lamb shift from the then fledgling theory of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "there are a number of consistent regularization schemes in use today in qed and other field theories of nature , with dimensional regularization being one of the most popular and easy to use .",
    "these regularization and renormalization schemes have allowed us to calculate a great many experimentally verified quantities , to extremely high precision , and there is no longer any doubt in their correctness .",
    "while extending the dimension of space to complex values might at first seem unsettling , this procedure works . when dimensional continuation was first introduced into quantum field theory , there were strong reactions against it .",
    "however , calculations performed with this method agree with calculations using other regularization schemes , and more important , with experiment . in time , particle physicists learned to accept the notion that one can perform correct three dimensional calculations by working in arbitrary complex dimensions . for our concerns , we note that refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have indeed calculated the lamb shift using the method of dimensional continuation .",
    "the problem of feynman - schwinger is avoided , and dimensional continuation gives the correct experimentally observed result with much less effort than more traditional methods . as the above discussion illustrates , this is no small achievement .    in summary",
    ", dimensional continuation is powerful because ( i ) it is a consistent regularization scheme that ( ii ) lends itself to a perturbative analysis , and ( iii ) requires relatively simple ( or at least easily learned ) calculational tools .",
    "dewitt s calculation  @xcite was certainly consistent , in that it matched the long and short - distance physics commensurately [ to order @xmath392 .",
    "this is because he starts with a finite regulated theory that treats long- and short - physics together within a single framework , albeit with a regularization scheme that does not lend itself to a systematic perturbative analysis . by comparison with the bps result , we know dewitt was accurate to order @xmath90 , inclusive .",
    "but , as illustrated by feynman s footnote 13 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and by the story of the lamb shift above , any attempt at treating the long- and short - distance physics by separate regularization schemes ( as much of the plasma literature currently does ) , will likely miss the very constants they are trying to calculate .",

    "for this reason , quantum field theory reveals something very deep about the structure of nature .",
    "however , for our purposes , we only need to think of quantum field theory as an elegant collection of tools for packaging and solving many - body problems , and plasma physics concerns itself with the many - body problem par excellence .",
    "it should therefore come as little surprise that quantum field theory can be useful for plasma physics .",
    "reference  @xcite is a nice example of cross fertilization between two quite different branches of physics , and it is gratifying for someone who has worked in both particle and plasma physics that such seemingly different subjects can inform one another . perhaps the most dramatic difference between particle and plasma physics lies with their respective methods and outlooks , and not so much the subject matter itself .",
    "a number of plasma physicist have explained to me that that plasma physics is not an _ exact _ science . while the nature of the subject might render a first - principles approach limited , particularly for subtopics like magneto - hydrodynamics in tokamaks or self - organized behavior in strongly coupled plasmas , i believe the plasma physicist could still benefit from the more rigorous outlook of particle physics .",
    "conversely , the particle physicist could benefit from plasma physics .",
    "in fact , until new high energy experiments come on - line , plasma physics may have more to offer particle physics than the reverse . until recently ,",
    "high energy physics was a spectacular field in which to work , but , with a few exceptions such as lattice gauge theory and rhic physics at bnl , the field seems to have been milked dry .",
    "high energy physics is in dire need of direct experimental input .",
    "plasma physics , on the other hand , still has many interesting and quite challenging problems of experimental and astrophysical relevance , and a number of these seem tailor - made for the field theorist .",
    "the particle physicist could therefore benefit by an excursion ( or even a longer stay ) in plasma physics .",
    "hence , my hidden agenda in these lectures : it would be quite nice to entice a few particle theorists to work on some of the interesting problems of plasma physics",
    ". it would also be nice to convince a few plasma physicists that particle theory has something to offer them as well .",

    "<S> we will examine  some of the more basic points of dimensional continuation , with an emphasis on the coulomb logarithm for electron - ion temperature equilibration . </S>",
    "<S> dimensional continuation , or dimensional regularization as it is more properly known in quantum field theory , was originally developed as part of the renormalization procedure for the theories of the electroweak and other fundamental interactions in particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> dimensional continuation is so general , in fact , that any _ theory _ can be unambiguously lifted to dimensions beyond three , and therefore the technique is powerful enough to apply in many other settings . </S>",
    "<S> the technique , however , is not well known outside the field theory and particle physics communities . </S>",
    "<S> this exposition will therefore be self - contained , intended for those who are not specialists in quantum field theory , and i will either derive or motivate any requisite field theory results or concepts . of particular relevance is the analogy between the coulomb logarithm as calculated by lyman spitzer on the one hand , and the lamb shift as calculated by hans bethe on the other . while dimensional continuation is a well developed and a thoroughly tested method for regularizing any quantum field theory , </S>",
    "<S> bps employs the method in a novel way that provides the leading and subleading behavior for processes that involve competing disparate energy or length scales . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , bps calculated the temperature equilibration rate to leading and next - to - leading order in the plasma number density for any two species in a plasma that are in thermal equilibrium with themselves , but not necessarily with each other . </S>",
