    "magnetic field measurements on board the geotail and ampte / irm spacecraft revealed that the power - law behaviour of the energy density spectra in frequency space , @xmath4 depends on the considered frequency range , both in the distant tail [ _ hoshino et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ] , and in the near - earth plasma sheet [ _ bauer et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ] .",
    "this finding was confirmed by _",
    "ohtani et al . _ [ 1995 ] using fractal analysis of the fluctuations in the ampte / cce and scatha magnetic field measurements .",
    "the spectral index changes around @xmath5 hz . the observed scaling indices are @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 when @xmath9 [ _ milovanov et al . _ , 2001 ; _ volwerk et al . _ , 2003 , 2004 ] .",
    "the uncertainty of the estimated values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be explained by slightly different frequency ranges studied by various authors and by the occurrence of spatially inhomogeneous , intermittent and transitory mechanisms involved in the generation of the observed scalings .",
    "since the characteristic timescale @xmath12 was found to be a few times the proton gyroperiod , ions can play an important role in the excitation of the corresponding magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the high - frequency part of the spectrum can be produced by an mhd cascading process .",
    "instability mechanisms or self - organisation processes , such as coalescence of magnetic islands or inverse cascades were proposed for the explanation of low - frequency scaling [ _ hoshino et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ] .    for frequencies higher than 0.1",
    "hz a second break in spectral power density was predicted theoretically at a turnover frequency @xmath13 [ _ milovanov et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ] .",
    "the estimation of the scaling index @xmath14 for frequencies @xmath15 , however , is encumbered by noise produced by the magnetometer itself . in this paper",
    "we examine those high frequency fluctuations for which the spectral indices @xmath11 and @xmath14 are expected . to this end",
    "we use a wavelet method which allows to estimate the scaling propeties of magnetic fluctuations over the mentioned frequency ranges .",
    "reliable spectral information could not be extracted , hitherto , from the noisy high - frequency magnetometer data .",
    "nonetheless , in section 2 we argue that an essentially unbiased wavelet method combined with an embedding technique of synthetic scaling signals allows us to estimate the scaling parameters reliably .",
    "very little is known about the origin of the multi - scale turbulence in the plasma sheet .",
    "its appearance is obviously dependent on the driving and dissipation mechanisms which characterize an observed fluctuating process [ _ borovsky and funsten _ , 2003 ] .",
    "magnetic field and plasma flow fluctuations were observed by a number of authors [ e.g. , _ coroniti et al .",
    "_ , 1980 ; _ borovsky et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ; _ neagu et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ] .",
    "plasma shear flows might appear as possible drivers of those fluctuations .",
    "the statistical analyses of ampte / irm data in the near - earth magnetotail have already shown that there exist rapid plasma flows in the central plasma sheet which are preferentially perpendicular to the magnetic field and strongly sunward oriented [ _ baumjohann et al .",
    "_ , 1989 , 1990 ] .",
    "subsequent research indicated that such flows are preferentially organized into sporadically occurring groups of bursty bulk flows ( bbf ) , typically lasting for @xmath16 min . despite their short duration , bbfs are the carriers of decisive amounts of mass , momentum and magnetic flux [ _ angelopoulos et al . _ , 1992 ; _ angelopoulos et al . _ , 1993 ; _ schdel et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ] .",
    "therefore bbfs can stir the plasma sheet plasma very efficiently .",
    "in this paper we place emphasis on comparison of multi - scale power and scaling properties of the magnetic fluctuations during bbf and non - flow or post - flow periods .",
    "we will also try to identify the turnover frequency @xmath13 , comparing the estimated values of @xmath11 and @xmath14 during bbf and non - bbf periods .",
    "the observed scaling features , together with those expected from mhd considerations , will help us to classify the magnetic fluctuations observed by the cluster spacecraft in the plasma sheet .",
    "recent approaches to mhd turbulence highlight the influence of a mean magnetic field on scale - dependent appearance of anisotropic fluctuations [ _ goldreich and shridhar _ , 1995 ] .",
    "the anisotropy increases towards small scales .",
    "therefore , the high - resolution cluster magnetometry provides a way for studying the scale - dependent anisotropy of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "we discuss the observed magnetic anisotropies in terms of recent mhd theories and simulations .",
    "we analyse the scaling properties of 67 hz resolution magnetic field fluctuations from the cluster fluxgate magnetometer [ _ balogh et al . _ ,",
    "2001 ] using a wavelet method proposed by _",
    "abry et al . , _ [ 2000 ] .",
    "wavelets offer an effective way for getting an unbiased estimate of @xmath17 [ _ veitch and abry _ , 1999 ] , whereas power spectral estimations are affected by frequency - dependent multiplicative bias [ _ abry et al . _ ,",
    "the spectral estimation is biased mainly because it is performed over a constant bandwidth which does not match the @xmath18 structure of the spectrum properly .",
    "the variance of discrete wavelet coefficients ( see later ) , however , matches well the power - law shaped spectrum . unlike fourier methods , wavelet methods work better for processes exhibiting spectral scaling because wavelets have inbuilt rescaling properties .",
    "the wavelet estimator allows to identify different kinds of scaling processes which are invisible to biased spectral estimators , especially in noisy and short data .",
    "_ abry et al . ,",
    "_ [ 2000 ] proposed a semi - parametric wavelet technique based on a fast pyramidal filter bank algorithm for the estimation of scaling parameters @xmath19 and @xmath17 in the relation @xmath20 , where @xmath19 is a nonzero constant .",
    "the algorithm consists of several steps .",
    "first , a discrete wavelet transform of the data is performed over a dyadic grid @xmath21 and @xmath22 . then , at each octave @xmath23 , the variance @xmath24 of the discrete wavelet coefficients @xmath25 is computed through @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of coefficients at octave @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 stands for the power spectrum of the mother wavelet @xmath31 .",
    "finally , from equation ( 1 ) @xmath17 and @xmath19 are estimated by constructing a plot of @xmath32 versus @xmath28 ( logscale diagram , ld ) and by using a weighted linear regression over the region @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a straight line . in this paper",
    "we use the daubechies wavelets for which finite data size effects are minimized and the number of vanishing moments @xmath35 can be changed .",
    "the latter allows to cancel or decrease the effects of linear or polynomial trends and ensures that the wavelet details are well defined .",
    "we note that the wavelet estimator , equation ( 1 ) , is also affected by a multiplicative bias ( multiplication by @xmath36 , see later ) , but @xmath37 is not frequency dependent .",
    "a similar multiplicative term for spectral estimators is frequency dependent , which makes the log - log plot of the power versus frequency not precisely linear .",
    "therefore the estimation of @xmath17 via linear regression in the log - log plot is strongly affected by bias [ _ abry et al . , _ 1995 ] . within the wavelet approach _ veitch and abry _ [ 1999 ]",
    "have found explicit solutions for the variances of @xmath38 which are then used in the weighted regression in the ld .",
    "these improvements make the wavelet estimator unbiased even for data of small length .",
    "different kinds of scaling can be analysed by this technique . the value of @xmath17 and the scaling range @xmath39 are characteristic for the specific scalings present [ _ abry et al . , _ 2000 ] .",
    "for example @xmath40 at the largest scales present in the data is characteristic for long range dependent processes , while @xmath41 at large scales together with @xmath40 at small scales is a signature of noise .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 aligned at almost all scales available corresponds to a nonstationary , self - similar ( fractal ) process having a fractal dimension @xmath43 [ _ abry et al .",
    ", _ 2000 ] .",
    "when the scaling index is estimated over a high frequency range , magnetometer noise can strongly influence the outcome . since different estimation techniques used over slightly different frequency ranges",
    ", there is a large scatter in the previously observed values of @xmath17 , which makes it difficult to compare the scaling properties in turbulence .",
    "furthermore , the estimated values are presumably affected by the occurrence of transitory processes in the plasma sheet .",
    "we therefore perform the estimation of @xmath19 and @xmath17 within sliding overlapping windows of width @xmath44 with a time shift @xmath45 to analyse the data over different frequency ranges with the same method and simultaneously take into account their temporal evolution .    in order to examine how",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr , the relative power of the signal and the noise in ld ) influences the estimation of @xmath46 within the window @xmath44 in small - scale fluctuations , we generate a self - similar fractal signal with known second order scaling properties using wavelets and embed it in a time series of quiet time magnetic field measurements from the cluster spacecraft . as a synthetic fractal signal",
    "we use fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) generated by a fast filter bank based pyramidal algorithm [ _ abry and sellan , _ 1996 ] .",
    "fractional brownian motion has a gaussian distribution of increments by definition .",
    "at the same time , magnetic fluctuations exhibit two - point gaussian statistics only for large separations .",
    "therefore , we consider the fbm process as an approximation which can roughly model the second order properties of the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "we suppose that the magnetic fluctuations observed in the plasma sheet during quiet times are close to the magnetometer noise level .",
    "figure 1a shows the magnetic field @xmath47 component ( 67 hz resolution ) observed by cluster 3 on september 7 , 2001 .",
    "if not specified the gsm coordinate system will be used throughout the paper .",
    "two short fractal signals @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with the same scaling index @xmath50 but different amplitude are added to @xmath47 . in figure",
    "1a @xmath47 is depicted from 1840 to 1917 ut .",
    "first , signal a is added into @xmath47 from @xmath511857 to @xmath511901 ut .",
    "the average amplitude of fluctuations of a is much larger than of @xmath47 . in figure 1b a dashed horizontal line show the theoretical value of @xmath50 .",
    "the estimated @xmath52 reaches this theoretical value in a wider interval in figure 1b as was the length of signal a in figure 1a .",
    "despite the non - precise timing , the estimated value of @xmath52 is correct .",
    "next , signal b is embedded into @xmath47 .",
    "signal b and @xmath47 have comparable average amplitude .",
    "the estimated @xmath53 in figure 1b does not achieve the theoretical horizontal line , therefore @xmath53 is underestimated .",
    "we can conclude that , whenever the amplitude of the signal is significantly larger than the amplitude of the noise ( case a ) , the correct value of @xmath17 is recovered , otherwise @xmath17 is underestimated ( case b ) .",
    "let us explain now the reason of non - precise timing . in figure 1b",
    "@xmath54 are estimated within a sliding window @xmath55 s over time scales ( octaves ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 s and @xmath59 hz ; these are approximate fourier periods and frequencies that correspond to the main oscillations within the daubechies wavelets ) .",
    "the embedded fractal signals a and b produce a rapid departure of the estimated values @xmath17 from the noise level @xmath60 , as soon as the analysing window includes some part of a fractal signal ( a or b in figure 1a ) .",
    "this effect is visible at @xmath511853 ut and before 1906 ut , when two analysing windows depicted by horizontal lines in figure 1b are centered in those time positions .",
    "the dashed , vertically extended right and left ends of the windows match perfectly the beginnings and the ends of the fractal signals a and b. when the timing is important , the effect of window length has to be accounted .",
    "another effect which influences the estimation of the scaling index @xmath17 . if the duration of a scaling process @xmath61 is less than half the window length , @xmath62 , @xmath17 is also underestimated . in figure 1a",
    "the length of the fractal signals a and b equals @xmath62",
    ". the proper sliding window length for unbiased estimation of @xmath17 can be found by trial . for decreasing @xmath44 the estimated @xmath17 increases , then saturates . obviously , as @xmath44 decreases , the fluctuations of the estimations increase . in general",
    ", @xmath44 has to be chosen such that the opposing requirements for robustness of scaling parameter estimations ( wide window needed ) and for time localization of short events ( narrow window needed ) were matched . for the events analysed in this paper @xmath63 s",
    "was found to be an optimal choice .",
    "finally , let us consider possible kinds of non - physical mechanisms which can lead to spurious scalings .",
    "time series analysis methods may lead to spurious results when applied to short data series containing irregularities , e.g. jumps , spikes [ _ katsev and lheureux , _ 2003 ] or random pulse trains [ _ watkins et al . , _ 2001 ] .",
    "spikes , i.e. , single values with large deviation are removed during quality check of the data .",
    "possible effects of other irregularities will be discussed jointly with the estimation of the scaling parameters in subsequent sections .",
    "the above explained embedding technique allows us to introduce corrections , whenever the amplitude of a fractal signal approaches the noise level .",
    "it can happen when high frequency ( small - scale ) scalings are examined .",
    "a few more steps are needed to explain the method in detail . to this end",
    "we show the typical scaling properties of a fractal signal ( @xmath64 ) , noise ( @xmath65 ) and of a compound additive process ( signal+noise , @xmath66 ) in ld . for",
    "what follows the subscripts @xmath67 will correspond to the specified processes .",
    "we also demonstrate that a single correction curve ( see later ) belongs to every embedded model fractal signal with a given @xmath68 .",
    "equation 1 describes the scaling properties of a signal through the scaling of the corresponding wavelet coefficients .",
    "taking a base 2 logarithm of both sides of equation 1 , we obtain an equation of line in ld .",
    "therefore any scaling signal ( a straight line in ld ) can be characterized by a pair of values @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the power of intercept at octave @xmath28 . here",
    "we suppose that , for a fixed mother wavelet , the last term , @xmath36 , on the right hand side of equation 1 , is dynamically unimportant .",
    "the change of @xmath71 , however , can influence the estimation of scaling parameters .",
    "we use the daubechies family of wavelets with changing number of vanishing moments @xmath35 . it does slightly influence our estimations and the corresponding uncertainities represent a source of error .",
    "figure 2 shows an exemple of ld .",
    "the magnetometer noise is depicted by a single curve , since we suppose , it is time - independent ( see later ) .",
    "it exhibits signatures typical for noise : @xmath72 at large scales ( @xmath73 ) together with @xmath74 at small scales ( @xmath75 ) [ _ abry et al . _",
    "2000 ] . for the sake of clarity",
    "the straight lines corresponding to the scalings of both signal and compound process are depicted only at the left hand side of figure 2 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the model fractal signal was changed from values larger to values smaller than the amplitude of the noise .",
    "the resulting parallel , shifted straight lines are representations of self - similar signals in ld .",
    "the compound process exhibits similar characteristics as the signal itself , while snr is large .",
    "if snr becomes @xmath77 , the compound process approaches the straight line of noise at the scales @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "time - independent noise has averages @xmath80 our goal is to estimate the time evolution of the scaling exponent of the signal @xmath81 for known @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the normalization @xmath84 ensures that for weak signals , @xmath85 ( noise dominates ) , and @xmath86 .",
    "actually , @xmath87 represents a time dependent snr .",
    "now we can use the introduced notation and the embedding technique to study the dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath89 within a window @xmath44 .",
    "figure 3 shows the relationship @xmath90 ( correction curves ) , which was obtained experimentally by embedding two model fractal signals with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , gradually decreasing their amplitudes ( decreasing snr ) , into quiet time @xmath47 measured by s / c 4 on september 7 , 2001 . for both model",
    "fractals the correction curves were computed at the octaves @xmath93 and @xmath94 , separately .",
    "independent of @xmath28 , @xmath88 approaches asymptotically @xmath95 for large enough @xmath89 .",
    "large @xmath89 means that snr is large and the compound signal exhibits the same scaling as the fractal model signal ( left - top straight lines in figure 2 ) . if @xmath86 , the noise dominates , and @xmath96 ( scaling of the compound process between @xmath97 and @xmath98 in figure 2 ) . between the two limits ( @xmath99 and @xmath86 )",
    ", however , the course of the curves for @xmath93 and @xmath94 in figure 3 is rather different . because of the complex behaviour of the compound process at @xmath93 near the noise level ( figure 2 )",
    ", @xmath88 can not be determined from the @xmath90 relationship unequivocally ( figure 3 ) .",
    "since the relation is unambiguous at the scale @xmath94 , we will consider the @xmath90 curves at that octave throughout the paper .",
    "the accuracy of the wavelet method estimation of @xmath17 can be controlled by the power of intercept of the compound process @xmath89 .",
    "figure 3 shows that for @xmath100 we find @xmath101 , therefore @xmath68 is underestimated .",
    "the @xmath90 relationship allows us to introduce corrections and estimate the effective asymptotic value of @xmath68 .",
    "we note that @xmath102 and @xmath103 are computed directly from magnetic field time series by using a sliding window w. the key assumption of the method is time - independence of the scaling parameters for noise .",
    "obviously , this condition is not strictly fulfilled .",
    "therefore , it is important to examine the time - independence of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath103 computed from magnetic field @xmath47 component ( 67 hz resolution ) observed by the cluster spacecraft s / c 1 and 3 during the quiet interval 1700 - 2100 ut on september 7 , 2001 , are depicted in figure 4 . here",
    "@xmath106 s and @xmath107 s. during the chosen interval the spacecraft are traversing the neutral sheet from the northern ( @xmath108 nt ) to the southern hemisphere ( @xmath109 nt ) ( figure 4a ) and the plasma flow velocity does not exceed 50 km / s ( not shown ) .",
    "independent of the location of the cluster spacecraft and despite the occurence of low frequency wave motion after 1830 ut , both @xmath103 and @xmath87 exhibit stationary behaviour , fluctuating around the mean values ( figure 4 b , c ) .",
    "the estimated @xmath88 can be related to the magnetometer noise @xmath110 because @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( see also figure 3 ) .",
    "noteworthy is that @xmath113 and @xmath114 are slightly different for each s / c ( figure 4b , c ) and also vary with the magnetic field components .",
    "the examination of several quiet time magnetic field time series and time series obtained from ground - based calibration measurements shows that in average ( including the four s / c and each magnetic component ) @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "similar values were obtained using 128 hz quiet time magnetic field measurements from the equator - s spacecraft ( not shown ) . for discrimination between @xmath68 ( which is expected to be @xmath117 ) and @xmath113 , this accuracy seems to be sufficient .",
    "it is expedient in concrete case studies , however , to compute the correction curves ( figure 3 ) for each spacecraft and component separately .",
    "examining @xmath88 and @xmath89 estimated for @xmath47 from s / c 2 on september 7 , 2001 , we found short , but significant deviations from @xmath105 and @xmath104 , respectively ( not shown ) .",
    "the deviations occurred due to a @xmath118 min long data gap on s / c 2 , which led to spurious scalings because of the step function - like irregularity in @xmath47 , in accordance with the findings of _ katsev and lheureux _ [ 2003 ] .",
    "this type of spurious estimations can easily be avoided by interpolation .",
    "another type of jump - related spurious estimation might occur near the plasma sheet boundary layer ( psbl ) or owing to its motion .",
    "the psbl can not be identified from the magnetic field measurements alone[_eastman et al .",
    "_ , 1984 ] .",
    "therefore , non - physical scalings due to magnetic jumps near psbl are not expected .    in summary",
    ", using the wavelet approach , we can estimate directly from a time series the time evolution of the parameters of a compound process @xmath119 .",
    "the time independent parameters of noise @xmath120 can be obtained from quiet time measurements .",
    "when @xmath87 is small , the effective asymptotic value of @xmath121 for a self - similar signal can be obtained from a correction curve taking a limit @xmath122 .",
    "spurious estimations during quiescent periods can be avoided by careful quality checks of the magnetic data .",
    "in order to introduce the wavelet method and the small - scale corrections to the estimated @xmath17 , quiet time magnetic measurements together with artificial fractal signals were used in the previous section . since",
    "our goal is to investigate bbf and non - bbf related magnetic turbulence , here we choose a @xmath123h interval during which the cluster spacecraft observed bbf and non - bbf intervals successively .      in what follows ,",
    "we analyse burst mode ( 67 hz ) magnetic data from the cluster fluxgate magnetometer ( fgm ) [ _ balogh et al . _ ,",
    "2001 ] during the interval 0110 - 0500 ut on august 27 , 2001 , when the cluster spacecraft were near the @xmath124 plane , in the postmidnight magnetotail ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the magnetic data are compared with the spin - resolution (  4 s ) velocity data from the cluster ion spectrometry ( cis / codif ) experiment [ _ rme et al .",

    "hereinafter we will refer to those scales as small scales @xmath128 and large scales @xmath129 , respectively . obviously , @xmath78 is limited by the resolution and @xmath130 by the chosen window @xmath44",
    ". the average noise levels @xmath131 for s / c 1,3 and @xmath47 magnetic components are also indicated by black and gray dashed lines in figure 5b .",
    "the large - scale scaling exponents are anticorrelated with the magnitude of @xmath47 simply because of the preferential occurrence of perpendicular flows closer to the neutral sheet ( @xmath132 nt ) .",
    "figure 5c shows the variation of the normalized power of the intercepts @xmath89 computed for the small scales @xmath133 .",
    "its time evolution exhibits periods of @xmath86 intermittently interrupted by bursts of activity when @xmath134 .",
    "the former corresponds to the noise level , indicating that there is no significant energy flow from large scales into small scales .",
    "the increased values of @xmath89 are associated with high frequency ( small - scale ) fluctuations of @xmath47 ( figure 5a ) , increased @xmath88 ( relative to @xmath105 , figure 5b ) and are well correlated with the appearance of bursty perpendicular flows ( figure 5d ) .",
    "the large scales @xmath135 are not corrupted significantly by magnetometer noise .",
    "the effect of spurious estimations due to spikes , random pulses , or other types of nonstationary signals can be addressed for bbf - associated periods , too .",
    "the use of daubechies analysing wavelets with vanishing moments ensures that part of the nonstationarities represented by polynomial trends are cancelled .",
    "spurious estimates of the scaling index might appear because of discontinuities which separate earthward moving plasma structures from the background plasma ahead of them [ _ sergeev et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] .",
    "in fact , before the appearance of the rapid perpendicular flow , e.g. , at  0131 ut ( figure 5d ) , there is a large jump in the large scale scaling index from @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "this jump and all similar jumps in our data can partly be explained by the presence of a discontinuity in front of the plasma flow [ _ nakamura et al .",

    ", this short effect can not be separated from the non - physical effect of the sliding window , explained above ( figure 1 ) .",
    "after 0130 ut , @xmath138 fluctuates around @xmath139 for more than 30 min ( figure 5b ) .",
    "we believe , that all estimations exhibiting small fluctuations around a mean value for equal or longer time than the sliding window length ( @xmath140 min ) , belong to a bbf - associated scaling process in our case . therefore these estimations are not spurious .",
    "the same is true for non - bbf associated processes .",
    "also , @xmath88 is largely coherent between s / c1 and 3 .",
    "short living pulses are supposed to be random , however .",
    "moreover , some results of multifractal approach [ _ vrs et al . _ , 2003 ] and of wavelet based structure function approach [ _ vrs et al . _ , 2004 ] also support the idea that bbf - associated magnetic fluctuations correspond to a physical scaling process .    during the bbf - associated periods",
    "one finds that @xmath141 , therefore @xmath142 is underestimated ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "since self - similarity is defined for @xmath143 , we used 4 model fractal time series with @xmath144 and quiet time @xmath47 magnetic data from s / c 1,3 to compute the @xmath90 correction curves at the octave j=4 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "these curves can be used to introduce corrections and to estimate the effective value of @xmath68 .",

    "the condition @xmath99 leads to @xmath145 , with slower approach to a model value for @xmath146 .",
    "the limit @xmath147 leads to @xmath148 .",
    "the error bars depicted at the left - top corner of figure 6 arise from the uncertainty of the estimation of @xmath88 in a logscale diagram using daubechies wavelets with varying number of vanishing moments ( @xmath149 ) and from the uncertainty of the magnetometer noise level estimation within the chosen window w. the depicted error bars represent only the uncertainity of the determination of the correction curves , and not the uncertainity of the estimations of @xmath150 .",

    "we note that the peaks at @xmath51 0240 ut from s / c 1 ( figure 5b , c ) appear due to the data gaps .      during non - bbf periods @xmath159 drops to the noise level when s / c 1,3 are in the lobe ( @xmath160nt ) or fluctuates between 1 and 2.5 when s / c 1,3 are in the plasma sheet ( figure 5a , b ) . among others ,",
    "the time evolution of the scaling indices can be influenced by the location of the cluster spacecraft , the duration and the magnitude of perpendicular flows and by the motion of the plasma sheet ( e.g. , thickening or thinning ) . despite the complexity , we can separate bbf and non - bbf associated magnetic fluctuations , based on two different conditions .",
    "condition 1 is based only on small - scale scaling parameters having for bbf - associated fluctuations on both s / c 1,3 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 and non - bbf - associated fluctuations @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "it simply means that we relate the observed small - scale magnetic fluctuation - dissipation activity to the large - scale magnetic fluctuations .",
    "we suppose that on the basis of scaling characteristics and power of small - scale magnetic fluctuations we can identify bbf and non - bbf associated intervals without actual examination of velocity data . for testing this supposition",
    "we use only the parameters computed from the magnetic field @xmath47 component measured by s / c 1,3 ( figure 5a - c ) .",
    "so we select only those values of @xmath159 from the whole period ( figure 5b ) which meet the above conditions for @xmath153 and @xmath89 .",
    "the conditional statistics performed on the large - scale scaling index gives for both s / c 1,3 @xmath165 for bbf - associated and @xmath166 for non - bbf associated case .",
    "now we consider also the velocity data .",
    "condition 2 is based on thresholding of perpendicular flows , taking @xmath167 km / s for rapid flows and @xmath168 km / s for non - bbf associated remnant flows .",
    "since the velocity data is available with a time resolution of @xmath123s and the time step between neighbouring sliding windows is @xmath169s , after adjusting times , @xmath159 can be compared to @xmath170 .",
    "it gives @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "all the estimates represent mean values with standard deviations .",
    "both conditions give the same statistical results on large - scale scaling index . from the conditions and",
    "the corresponding values of large - scale indices follows that , relative to non - bbf associated intervals , bbf - associated intervals exhibit both large - scale and small - scale spectral steepening and an unambiguous increase of small - scale power of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "therefore we propose that small - scale magnetic fluctuations are energized by bbf s .",
    "then the spectral transfer of energy to small scales is transient , which makes the position of the spectral break at the expected turnover frequency @xmath13 uncertain .",
    "our results suggest that whenever bbf - associated magnetic fluctuations occur , the break at @xmath173 disappears when the small - scale corrections are introduced .",
    "otherwise the energy flow to small scales ends at @xmath13 , and in this case , at frequencies @xmath15 , the measured scaling parameters belong to the noise .",
    "the examination of the ld s at various ranges of scales shows that @xmath13 may correspond to the approximate fourier frequencies of @xmath174 hz ( between octaves @xmath79 and @xmath175 ) .",
    "the same analysis of the @xmath176 and @xmath177 magnetic field components shows that the observed scaling features remain similar to the @xmath47 case .",
    "the small - scale @xmath176 and @xmath177 fluctuations are also associated mainly with @xmath170 . after introducing corrections as above , @xmath178 for bbf and @xmath179 for remnant flows , the errors in the same range as above , in conditional statistics of @xmath47 .",
    "a dissimilarity appears in @xmath177 small - scale fluctuations ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the small - scale power @xmath89 of @xmath177 fluctuations ( figure 7c ) during bbf - associated intervals is several times larger than that of @xmath47 ( figure 5c ) or @xmath176 ( not shown ) .",
    "usually @xmath180 over time scales less than 1 s. this is a signature of anisotropy and we will examine it deeper .",
    "the small - scale powers of the magnetic field components from s / c 1,3 , computed at @xmath94 ( @xmath181 s ) , are compared in log - log scatterplots in figure 8 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath47 and @xmath176 components shows a balanced scatter around the line @xmath182 ( figure 8a ) , though the increased population of points under that line between @xmath183 , indicates a weak anisotropy .",
    "the scatterplot of @xmath184 and @xmath185 shows strong anisotropy ( figure 8b ) for values @xmath186 .",
    "we also calculated the scatterplots at scale @xmath187 ( @xmath188 s ) ( figures 9 a , b ) , which , after comparison with figure 8b , indicate scale dependent anisotropy .",
    "the anisotropy increases towards small scales . since @xmath189 and @xmath190 in figure 8 ,",
    "the small - scale magnetic fluctuations are generated due to multi - scale transfer of energy preferentially in the gsm @xmath191 or @xmath192 direction .",
    "the powers at the scale @xmath187 show more isotropy , even if the scatterplot of @xmath184 versus @xmath193 ( figure 9a ) indicates that , with increasing scales the field - aligned power of fluctuations can also increase .",
    "the points depicted by + signs in figures 8b and 9b belong to the time period between 0400 and 0410 ut . during this interval",
    "a magnetic reconnection event in the central plasma sheet at 0401 ut was identified by _",
    "baker et al . _",
    "the corresponding + points in figures 8b and 9b , therefore , are associated with the magnetic reconnection or / and the tailward flow , leading to a strong anisotropy which does not exhibit the same increase towards the small scales as it is observed for the other points .",
    "therefore the underlying mechanism which drives these fluctuations should be different from the previous scale dependent one .",
    "since only this reconnection - related short interval shows different anisotropy characteristics , we can not say more about the nature of the underlying physical processes .",
    "answering the question about reconnection or tailward flow associated anisotropy characteristics certainly requires a thorough statistical analysis .",
    "we can speculate , however , that the observed scale - independent anisotropy features might be related to the specific current systems or magnetic field topology near the reconnection site [ _ nagai et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; _ runov et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ] .",
    "the small - scale @xmath153 for individual components are compared in scatterplots in figure 10 a , b .",
    "again , @xmath194 seems to be different from @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "this anisotropy can weaken , however , because non - corrected values are depicted and the corrections are larger for @xmath197 than for @xmath177 ( figures 5c and 7c ) .",
    "the anisotropy can also be considered in the coordinate system of the local mean field .",
    "we computed the mean total magnetic field vector through low - pass filtering the gsm magnetic field components and using standard vector operations transformed the burst mode magnetic data into mean - field perpendicular ( @xmath198 ) and mean - field aligned ( @xmath199 ) components .",
    "figures 11a , b show @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively , computed for averaged @xmath200 at the time - scale @xmath201 s. figures 11 c , d show the perpendicular @xmath202 and the parallel @xmath203 powers , computed at the scales @xmath204 ( @xmath181 s ) and @xmath187 ( @xmath188 s ) . as above for the gsm @xmath205 components ( figures 8 - 10 ) ,",
    "the anisotropy is scale dependent and the small - scale power preferentially develops in directions perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "again , the short interval after @xmath206 ut shows a different kind of reconnection or tailward flow related behavior . the large - scale ( @xmath187 ) perpendicular power remains larger than the parallel power only during this interval .",
    "the similarity of the statistical results obtained in gsm and mean field coordinate systems can be explained as follows : for open , stretched magnetic field lines @xmath199 resembles @xmath47 and @xmath198 is similar to @xmath207 ( where @xmath208 and @xmath209 are the gsm components of the magnetic field ) .",
    "dissimilarities can appear close to the neutral sheet when @xmath210 .",
    "let us investigate now the effect of the transitory character of the fluctuations or their drivers .",
    "we compare magnetic fluctuations observed at the same time on two spatially separated cluster spacecraft .",
    "figure 12 compares the parallel @xmath211 and the perpendicular @xmath212 scaling indices from s / c 1 and 3 .",
    "the scatterplot in ( figure 12a ) involves all the magnetic data from s / c 1,3 and forms an irregular cloud of points .",
    "we applied two - point conditional statistics to find bbf- and non - bbf - associated points in that cloud .",
    "we used the same small - scale condition 1 combined with the velocity condition 2 as above ( both should give the same results ) , and required the fulfilment jointly at s / c 1,3 at the same time . in consequence of the joint conditional requirement the amount of data points in ( figures 12 b , c ) is significantly reduced .",
    "it can be explained partially by a relatively high level of fluctuations of the considered parameters .",
    "for example , the perpendicular velocity wildly fluctuates during the rapid flows ( e.g. figure 5d ) which makes the comparison with the small - scale parameters more difficult .",
    "the omission of the velocity condition , however , does not add many more points to the figures 12 b , c .",
    "therefore , we suppose that fewer joint data points are found by two - point conditional statistics because the two spacecraft are often in physically different regions , exhibiting different scaling features .",
    "it indicates that the magnetic fluctuations and their sources are transient and limited in space .",
    "the statistical evaluation of the bbf - associated data points in figure 12b gives averages @xmath213 and @xmath214 which is consistent with the previous estimations using the components @xmath215 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the + signs in figure 12b represent measurements during the reconnection event , discussed above .",
    "figure 12c shows the non - bbf - associated data points . here",
    "the + signs represent measurements near the plasma sheet boundary layer or in the lobe ( @xmath216 nt ) while the remaining points are inside of the plasma sheet ( @xmath217 nt ) .",
    "the statistical evaluation of the latter gives @xmath218 and @xmath219 , which is again consistent with the previous estimations using the components @xmath215 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "let us summarize the main results at the end of this section .",
    "we used a wavelet method to study the small - scale properties of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "we found that the energy transfer to the smallest available time scales is associated with bbfs .",
    "the scaling properties of those fluctuations are recoverable from burst mode magnetic fluctuations by using an embedding technique .",
    "small - scale fluctuations show an increased anisotropy relative to the mean magnetic field . the anisotropy is observed mainly in the normalized power of the magnetic fluctuations , while it is less evident in the spectral scaling index .",
    "the transient character of the physical processes or driving mechanisms makes a robust estimation of the basic characteristics of magnetic turbulence difficult in the plasma sheet .",
    "a complete characterization of mhd turbulence requires not only a statistical description of the velocity field , but also a statistical study of other measurable quantities , e.g. magnetic field , density or temperature fluctuations . in this paper",
    "we analysed a  4 hour long period of high quality burst mode ( 67 hz ) magnetic field data , which allowed an immersion to the scale or frequency ranges which are not available in velocity measurements .",
    "we considered time scales from @xmath220 to @xmath221 s , which , assuming @xmath222 km / s velocities during rapid flows , correspond roughly to spatial scales of @xmath223 km in the flow direction .",
    "the average velocities are smaller than @xmath222 km / s , so the largest scale can be significantly smaller than @xmath224 km . also , both the velocities and the estimated spatial scales are smaller in other than the maximum velocity direction or during non - bbf intervals .",
    "since the average separation of the cluster spacecraft was @xmath225 km during 2001 , we used principally a single - point technique to analyse scaling characteristics of magnetic fluctuations from s / c 1,3 .",
    "the usual multi - point statistical approach , commonly available in laboratory measurements , is not available in the plasma sheet at those scales and the conversion of the scaling characteristics of magnetic fluctuations in time into scaling laws in wavenumber space is possible only through additional hypotheses .",
    "the taylor hypothesis assumes that the conversion is possible if the spatial fluctuations on a given scale pass over the spacecraft faster than they typically evolve in time . in the plasma sheet",
    "this can be the case during fast bbf s [ _ horbury _ , 2000 ] or during strong global bulk flows which may occur after a dynamical reconfiguration of the magnetotail [ _ borovsky and funsten _ , 2003 ] . otherwise , the random velocities of the fluctuations advect spatial structures over the spacecraft .",
    "a more realistic approach is the so - called random sweeping model ( rsm ) , which takes the basically random velocities of the flow into account and allows to obtain statistical information on spatial structures .",
    "_ borovsky et al . _ [ 1997 ] have used rsm and found that the spectral index , describing the scaling properties of magnetic fluctuations in the plasma sheet at the frequency range of @xmath226 @xmath227 , is the same in both frequency or wavenumber representations , that is , @xmath228 .",
    "the large - scale ( @xmath229 @xmath227 ) used in this paper partially overlaps with the scales of _ borovsky et al . _",
    "[ 1997 ] paper .",
    "note that , rsm is supposed to work when the large scale velocity field drives the small - scale fluctuations .",
    "this seems to be valid in our case due to the high correlation between bbfs and small - scale magnetic fluctuations .",
    "therefore we suppose , that at least at the scales ( @xmath230 ) the equality @xmath228 holds also in our case and the estimated values of @xmath17 can be compared with the power - law dependence of power spectra in mhd turbulence .",
    "we have to underline , however , that rsm is only a model and its validity should be proven comparing real spatial and time structures . in absence of such comparisons",
    "the interpretation of scaling indices in terms of mhd turbulence remains disputable . at the same time , we consider the observed anisotropy effects to be more reliable .",
    "let us start the comparison of observations and theory , therefore , with the evaluation of the influence of a local mean magnetic field on anisotropy of fluctuations .",
    "the clear signs of the interaction of rapid flows with the magnetic field in the plasma sheet are the bbf - associated dipolarization of field lines ( increase of @xmath177 ) and the breaking and diversion of the flows around the dipolar inner magnetosphere .",
    "the presence of a mean magnetic field in the plasma sheet can not be eliminated by coordinate transformations .",
    "this is in contrast with hydrodynamic turbulence , where the anisotropy usually ceases in the coordinate system of the average flow [ _ biskamp _ , 2003 ] .",
    "the classical kolmogorov theory for hydrodynamic and the iroshnikov - kraichnan theory for mhd turbulence assume isotropy of the inertial - range energy cascade in fourier space , exhibiting scalings @xmath231 and @xmath232 , respectively ( @xmath233 is the amount of energy between wavenumbers @xmath234 and @xmath235 divided by @xmath236 ) .    _ shebalin et al . _ [ 1983 ] studied incompressible mhd anisotropies arising in wave vector space in the presence of a mean magnetic field .",
    "they studied the interaction of opposite - travelling wave packets and found that , in wave vector space , those interactions produce modes with wavevectors preferentially perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "_ goldreich and sridhar _ [ 1995 ] proposed a balance condition between parallel and perpendicular modes ( parallel propagating alfvn waves and perpendicular eddy motions ) . on this basis",
    "it was shown that a scale dependent anisotropy appears , namely @xmath237 ( or @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is the characteristic scale of eddies in parallel and perpendicular directions ) , which means that the anisotropy is increasing with decreasing scale .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the perpendicular fluctuations exhibit kolmogorov scaling @xmath231 .",
    "in other words , the mean magnetic field does not influence the perpendicular hydrodynamic cascade formed by eddies .",
    "the coupled parallel fluctuations are essentially produced by waves . in the case of compressible mhd",
    "the alfvn modes follow the anisotropic goldreich - sridhar scaling while fast modes exhibit isotropy [ _ cho et al . _ ,",
    "2003 ] .",
    "the scale dependent anisotropy proposed by _ goldreich and sridhar _ [ 1995 ] would represent a way the relative importance of alfvn waves and eddy motions might be recognized .",
    "_ matthaeus et al .",
    "_ [ 1998 ] tested this assumption using fourier spectral methods for mhd equations in a periodic cube .",
    "they have found , that for incompressible , weakly compressible and driven mhd turbulence , anisotropy scales linearly with the ratio of fluctuating to total magnetic field strength .",
    "their results therefore seem to be inconsistent with the goldreich - sridhar model .",
    "_ cho and vishniac _ [ 2000 ] argued , however , that the fourier technique used by _",
    "matthaeus et el .",
    "_ [ 1998 ] smooths out the true scaling relation for anisotropy .",
    "it happens because the anisotropic eddies or wave packets are elongated along magnetic field lines .",
    "when they follow the large - scale variation of the magnetic field , they point in different directions .",
    "consequently , the information about the eddy shapes is lost when a global transformation such as the fourier transformation is applied . _",
    "cho and vishniac _ [ 2000 ] showed that , when the eddy shapes relative to the local magnetic field are analysed in real space , the goldreich - sridhar scaling is recovered .",
    "for what follows , it is important that not only the velocity statistics exhibits the goldreich - sridhar anisotropy , but also the magnetic field statistics [ _ cho and lazarian _ ,",
    "if we suppose similarity between frequency and wavenumber scalings , then our results suggest that the observed magnetic turbulence in the plasma sheet also resembles the anisotropy of goldreich - sridhar model . the small - scale magnetic turbulence is stronger in perpendicular directions .",
    "it is mainly visible when the relative powers of fluctuations are compared ( figures 8 and 11 ) .",
    "then , except for the short interval when magnetic reconnection and tailward flow occurs , the anisotropy is scale dependent ( figures 8,9 ) .",
    "the applied wavelet technique ensures that the scale - dependent anisotropy is not smoothed out .",
    "namely , over each considered scale range the local trend ( local mean field ) is cancelled by the analysing wavelet having a proper number of vanishing moments .",
    "the observed anisotropy seems to indicate that the small - scale eddy turbulence is stronger than the alfvnic turbulence .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of _ borovsky and funsten _ [ 2003 ] , who claimed that turbulence of eddies rather than the turbulence of alfvn waves prevails in the plasma sheet .",
    "their observation is based on three different arguments : ( a. ) alfvn wave turbulence produces scale sizes that are larger than the vertical size of the plasma sheet , whereas eddy turbulence does not ; ( b. ) the autocorrelation length of the turbulence is typical for eddy turbulence ; ( c. ) the low alfvn ratio ( ratio of the kinetic energy of the flow to the energy density of magnetic fluctuations ) indicates 2d eddy structures .",
    "all these results might yield a picture of the goldreich - sridhar model and quasi-2d mhd turbulence .",
    "the quasi-2d mhd picture is supported by numerical studies of high reynolds number turbulence which predict that the spatial distribution of the turbulent fields is more intermittent in 2d than in 3d mhd ( [ _ biskamp _ , 2003 ] , and references therein ) . since bbf - associated magnetic fluctuations are stretched down to the small scales @xmath133 ( figures 5,7 ) , where the anisotropy becomes stronger and turbulence might be essentially 2d , an increase of the small scale intermittence can be expected , too . indeed , _",
    "vrs et al . _",
    "[ 2003 ] have shown that small scale magnetic field intermittence increases during bbf - associated intervals . here , some more words of caution have to be added .",
    "first of all , the importance of multi - scale dynamics in turbulence has to be underlined .",
    "since the goldreich - sridhar anisotropy is scale dependent , at sufficiently large scales this kind of anisotropy can disappear , and even alfvnic turbulence can become stronger",
    ". figures 9a and 11 d show that the large scale power of parallel ( @xmath240 or @xmath199 ) fluctuations can be equal with or slightly overpower the perpendicular components ( @xmath241 or @xmath198 ) .",
    "the development of anisotropy and 2d structures can also be dependent on the actual reynolds numbers , helicity , alfvn ratio [ _ oughton et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ] or be influenced by the presence of transverse pressure - balanced magnetic structures or transverse velocity shears [ _ ghosh et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ] . in this respect",
    "it is important to note that in our case the mean field direction is constantly changing due to the time - varying contribution of magnetic field components to the total magnetic field ( compare figures 5,7 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the small scale power of the @xmath177 ( vertical ) fluctuations is the strongest all the time . the vertical gsm direction , however , is not always the perpendicular direction to the mean magnetic field .",
    "therefore the effect of the mean field , even if it represents a robust way for the development of scale - dependent anisotropy has to be complemented by other mechanisms , which can produce strong fluctuations in perpendicular directions .",
    "for example the above mentioned transverse magnetic structures or velocity shears can also redirect the initially parallel - propagating alfvn waves to highly oblique waves [ _ ghosh et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ] .",
    "in the plasma sheet , bbf - associated dipolarization , increase of @xmath209 ( or @xmath208 when the current sheet is tilted ) , can represent such a transverse magnetic structure .",
    "also , the relative thinness of the plasma sheet in the z direction and the associated boundary effects can produce anisotropy statistics in plasma sheet turbulence [ _ vrs et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ] .",
    "to evaluate the possible contributions of these mechanisms a wider statistical study is required , however .",
    "let us consider now the estimated scaling indices @xmath17 in comparison with the predictions of goldreich - sridhar model .",
    "when the anisotropy effects are neglected , the conditional statistics explained above gives for bbf - associated flows the large scale index @xmath242 , independent on magnetic field component .",
    "it is definitely different from the goldreich - sridhar model which predicts kolmogorov scaling with @xmath243 in perpendicular direction .",
    "we could advance an argument that the goldreich - sridhar anisotropy is weaker at the scales @xmath135 , but the small - scale @xmath150 reaches the same range of values when the estimated @xmath89 is large enough and allows to introduce corrections .",
    "@xmath159 decreases and approaches the kolmogorov scaling during non - flow or post - bbf intervals , when the ratio of the large - scale mean field to the magnetic fluctuations becomes larger and the conditions for the development of goldreich - sridhar anisotropy are more favourable . in this case",
    "the estimated @xmath244 .",
    "the large error appears because the post - flow intervals usually correspond to transient , probably decaying turbulence .",
    "this also causes that one can not distinguish between the kolmogorov and iroshnikov - kraichnan models .",
    "the high value of @xmath159 during bbf - associated intervals does not necessarily mean that the goldreich - sridhar phenomenology fails .",
    "magnetic fluctuations are subject to an additional constraint which acts during rapid flows only .",
    "the limited vertical dimension of the flow channel or the plasma sheet thickness can modify the actual value of @xmath17 increasing it to @xmath245 , which is a limiting value for fully developed 2d hydrodynamic turbulence [ _ volwerk et al .",
    "_ , 2003 , 2004 , _ vrs et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ] .",
    "the work described here demonstrates the ability of the windowed wavelet estimator for obtaining reliable estimates of the effective second - order scaling parameters @xmath246 even in situations when the noise level is relatively high .",
    "magnetic turbulence seems to be steady only during relatively short time intervals ( a few minutes ) , otherwise @xmath46 exhibits nonstationary behaviour at all scales , which can partially explain the large scatter of previously estimated values of scaling indices . as we observed magnetic turbulence",
    "associated with bursty flows and post - flow intervals , our findings agree well with previous knowledge that the flow of plasma in the earth s magnetotail is intrinsically unsteady [ _ e.g .",
    "baumjohann _ , 2002 ] .",
    "joint conditional statistics from two cluster spacecraft s / c 1,3 shows a high level of spatial intermittence which is related to the differing scaling features in physically different regions in the plasma sheet .",
    "the examination of bbf - associated high frequency magnetic fluctuations within a sliding window showed that the small - scale ( @xmath247 ) and large - scale ( @xmath230 ) scaling indices are equal within error estimations .",
    "_ volwerk et al . _ [ 2003 , 2004 ] have obtained similar scaling exponents for the time scales 1 - 13 s. it means that the spectral break predicted by _",

    "we found that , for the scales analysed , the conversion of the observed scalings from frequency to wavenumber representation is model dependent and can not be verified by direct comparison of spatial and temporal variations .",
    "it makes the interpretation of the results in terms of mhd phenomenology more difficult .",
    "the anisotropy features of magnetic fluctuations provided additional tools to facilitate the interpretation of the results .",
    "the anisotropy is better visible in the normalized power of fluctuations @xmath19 than in the scaling index @xmath17 .",
    "it was shown that large - scale magnetic fluctuations are more isotropic while small - scale magnetic turbulence evolves in direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field , usually in the gsm @xmath191 or @xmath192 direction , and the observed anisotropy is scale dependent .",
    "it partly agrees with the predictions of goldreich - sridhar model of mhd turbulence , but the additional effect of transverse magnetic structures or velocity shears can not be excluded . on this basis",

    "<S> small - scale magnetic turbulence observed by the cluster spacecraft in the plasma sheet is investigated by means of a wavelet estimator suitable for detecting distinct scaling characteristics even in noisy measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral estimators used for this purpose are affected by a frequency dependent bias . </S>",
    "<S> the variances of the wavelet coefficients , however , match the power - law shaped spectra , which makes the wavelet estimator essentially unbiased . </S>",
    "<S> these scaling characteristics of the magnetic field data appear to be essentially non - steady and intermittent . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling properties of bursty bulk flow ( bbf ) and non - bbf associated magnetic fluctuations are analysed with the aim of understanding processes of energy transfer between scales . </S>",
    "<S> small - scale ( @xmath0 s ) magnetic fluctuations having the same scaling index @xmath1 as the large - scale ( @xmath2 s ) magnetic fluctuations occur during bbf - associated periods . during non - bbf </S>",
    "<S> associated periods the energy transfer to small scales is absent , and the large - scale scaling index @xmath3 is closer to kraichnan or iroshnikov - kraichnan scalings . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy characteristics of magnetic fluctuations show both scale - dependent and scale - independent behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the former can be partly explained in terms of the goldreich - sridhar model of mhd turbulence , which leads to the picture of alfvnic turbulence parallel and of eddy turbulence perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , other physical mechanisms , such as transverse magnetic structures , velocity shears , or boundary effects can contribute to the anisotropy characteristics of plasma sheet turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the scale - independent features are related to anisotropy characteristics which occur during a period of magnetic reconnection and fast tailward flow . </S>"
