    "soon after the original proposal of semiconductor superlattices @xcite , two apparently quite different schemes to obtain optical gain in such novel systems were put forward . in a seminal work , kazarinov and suris pointed out how to achieve a population inversion , a key ingredient to obtain light amplification , between electronic subbands in a strongly biased superlattice @xcite . on the other hand , based on semi - classical arguments , ktitorov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and later ignatov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite predicted optical gain due to bloch oscillations within a miniband  despite a missing population inversion .",
    "two decades later , the demonstration of the quantum cascade laser @xcite affirmed the first proposal .",
    "the ( conduction ) band structure in each period is carefully designed to allow for injecting electrons into an upper subband state , with a long non - radiative lifetime , and to enable a fast extraction of electrons from an accordingly tailored lower state . as a consequence , population inversion is achieved .",
    "also , by a suitable design , the structure is electrically stable at threshold . by now , the quantum cascade laser technology covers a wide range of the electro - magnetic spectrum .",
    "recently , a room - temperature continuous - wave laser @xcite emitting at a wavelength of @xmath0 has been demonstrated and stimulated emission in the terahertz regime at about @xmath1 @xcite has been observed .",
    "in contrast to this , the feasibility of the bloch oscillator , emitting electro - magnetic radiation , tunable by the external electric dc field , is still under question . besides the task to stabilize the electric field domains in a biased superlattice at the point of operation ,",
    "the description of the gain mechanism is , so far , based on semi - classical models only . in a naive picture , electro - magnetic radiation of photon energy @xmath2",
    "is expected , corresponding to the frequency of bloch oscillations @xmath3 that linearly depends on the applied dc field @xmath4 . for , _",
    "e.g. _ a superlattice period @xmath5 of some nanometers and fields of several tenth of @xmath6 , the photon frequencies are in the terahertz range .",
    "in fact , semi - classical calculations exhibit neither gain nor absorption at resonance , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath7 , but transparency . particularly in the quantum - mechanical picture",
    ", it is evident that only spontaneous transitions can occur at resonance . at sufficiently high electric fields ,",
    "the miniband is split into the wannier - stark ladder , a set of states evenly spaced by @xmath8 in energy .",
    "resonant stimulated emission processes between adjacent states are balanced by absorption processes , because of the translational symmetry of the system , which dictates equal occupation for all rungs of the wannier - stark ladder .",
    "nevertheless , the semi - classical calculation does predict gain  without inversion  for non - resonant transitions with a `` too small '' photon energy , @xmath9 , and absorption for @xmath10 .",
    "but the existence and strength of this semi - classically predicted bloch gain is still discussed , despite experimental observation of many related phenomena in superlattices , such as negative differential conductivity @xcite , the associated bloch oscillations @xcite and the coupling of the superlattice to external thz radiation @xcite , just to mention a few .",
    "in particular , the gain mechanism is lacking an interpretation in terms of the quantum - mechanical wannier - stark picture .    in this paper",
    "such a quantum - mechanical interpretation of the bloch gain in superlattices is suggested and a link is established between the intersubband gain originating from a population inversion , with its symmetric spectral shape centered at the transition energy , and the dispersive gain predicted for a periodic superlattice , with its nearly anti - symmetric profile .",
    "the quantum - mechanical model , based on the density matrix formalism similar to the one employed earlier @xcite , yields a general expression for the gain profile in intersubband transitions .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present the model system , and discuss assumptions and details of the density matrix calculation . with less stringent approximations than those made by kazarinov and suris we find an expression for the coherence between two , at first spatially separated , subband states that are coupled by tunneling and broadened by intra - subband scattering .",
    "the coherence determines current density as well as optical transitions . transforming to the basis of eigenstates of the biased heterostructure  the wannier - stark basis for the superlattice ",
    "the model is extended to describe optical transitions between any pair of subbands .    in sec .",
    "iii we apply the theory to superlattices and obtain the quantum mechanical counterparts to the semi - classical results for both the esaki - tsu current - voltage characteristics and the dispersive bloch gain .",
    "the results are quantitatively compared to the predictions of the semi - classical picture , where good agreement is found for higher electron temperatures .    in sec .",
    "iv intersubband transitions are investigated for the quantum cascade structure and the relation between ( anti - symmetric ) bloch gain and lorentzian - shaped intersubband gain becomes apparent : the theory predicts a transition from the lorentzian shaped inversion gain to the dispersive bloch gain with decreasing population inversion accompanied by a red - shift of the peak gain with respect to the transition energy .",
    "we consider two subbands , confined in adjacent wells , that serve as a model system for photon - assisted tunneling structures and , in particular , for transitions within the wannier - stark ladder of a weakly coupled superlattice . to start with , the same basis as in the original work of kazarinov and suris",

    "the steady - state values of the coherences of the density matrix @xmath33 , which determine the transitions @xmath34 , the current and the absorption , are obtained from a laplace average @xcite defined by @xmath35 and performing the laplace limit @xmath36 using the relation @xmath37 at the appropriate stage of the calculation . in this approach",

    "the second term , which has been discarded so far , contains differences in population within a subband .",
    "it is this term which will be responsible for the second order type of gain , leading to the characteristic negative differential conductivity and the dispersive gain profile in a superlattice , and a modified spectral shape of the gain in a quantum cascade laser .",

    "optical properties are deduced from the high - frequency response to an additionally applied ac field . in the case of a photon - assisted tunneling transition ,",
    "the hamiltonian is supplemented by @xmath66 for a vector potential @xmath67 with an amplitude @xmath68 of the high - frequency field . noting the similar structure of @xmath69 and the non - diagonal part of @xmath19 , the corrections to the coherences in linear response @xmath70 and @xmath71 are related to @xmath59 and @xmath58 by @xmath72 which are evaluated at an energy @xmath73 instead of @xmath74 due to the time dependence of the ac field .",

    "the preceding expression contains the two gain mechanisms as limiting cases of a more general intersubband gain profile with a simple physical interpretation .",
    "before we discuss the quantum - mechanical paths involved , the expression may be generalized to an arbitrarily located pair of subband states .    to account for vertical as well as diagonal transitions the basis of eigenstates of the biased system",

    "since the operator of the high frequency field @xmath80 does not change its purely non - diagonal structure , inspection of the previous equations and replacement of @xmath81 by @xmath82 naturally extends the equation for the gain profile to any intersubband transition and permits to omit the rather arbitrary distinction between a diagonal and vertical transition @xmath83 as will be shown in the following , expression ( [ gain ] ) allows a simple explanation of the gain mechanism in a superlattice and in a quantum cascade structure .",

    "in contrast to the peak inversion gain , which does not depend on temperature and decreases with scattering , the latter decreases with temperature as the differences in occupation between initial and final states diminish , but increases with more frequent scattering processes .",

    "<S> it corroborates the predictions of the semi - classical miniband picture , according to which gain is predicted for photon energies lower than the bloch oscillation frequency , whereas net absorption is expected at higher photon energies , as a description which is valid in the high - temperature limit . a red - shift of the amplified emission with respect to the resonant transition energy results from the dispersive gain contribution in any intersubband transition , for which the population inversion is small . </S>"
