    "is used to generate accurate results for the detectability of the gz effect . from the results obtained by these simulations",
    "it is clear why current experiments have not been able to detect the gz effect .",
    "we also use the measurable properties of this effect on earth to design an experiment that is able to use the gz effect to study the composition of the cosmic ray flux in space .",
    "the gz event simulation convolutes the energy spectrum of photons from the sun and the cosmic ray energy flux for nuclei with the cross section of photon - nuclei interactions to predict differential event rates .",
    "the fragments potentially hit the earth are then back tracked using a ray tracing algorithm through the solar inter - planetary magnetic field to generate efficiently events for which both collision fragments hit the earth .",

    "the cross sections are maximal at an energy of @xmath18  eev and @xmath19  eev for iron and oxygen respectively . in the gz event simulation",
    "the angle between the photon and incoming cosmic ray nucleus is determined at each point in space assuming the photons are emitted radially by the sun and the cosmic rays come from random directions .",

    "we have shown that the probability of a gz interaction for cosmic nuclei passing through our solar system is maximally @xmath38 .",
    "this maximum occurs when its trajectory is close to the surface of the sun .",

    "it is much more favourable to perform a measurement of the gz effect in a direction away from the sun .",
    "the lower interaction probability is partly compensated by a lower energy threshold for the incoming cosmic rays , as the interaction with solar photons is head - on .",
