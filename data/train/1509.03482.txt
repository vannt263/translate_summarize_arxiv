    "<S> @xcite to be @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood considering a simple model based on the fact that light concentrates in the regions with high permittivity . </S>",
    "<S> then , the rate with which the overlap integral between a test field profile and the permittivity profile decreases , while shifting the test field profile along the @xmath47-direction quantifies how difficult it is to break the symmetry in the system and induce the @xmath0  transition . the higher the number of dimers , the slower the change of this overlap integral is and , consequently , the easier it is to induce the @xmath0-symmetry - breaking transition . </S>",
    "<S> the second conclusion states that with the increase of the number of dimers , the threshold value converges to the value corresponding to the infinite array as expected because the structure becomes more similar to the infinite array .    </S>",
    "<S> presents the evolution of the light propagating in the nonlinear coupler built of three @xmath0-symmetric dimers described by [ eqn : cos_ind ] . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the system is in the broken @xmath0-symmetric regime , and the light is injected into the gain mode of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of this mode grows rapidly , causing the nonlinear increase of the real part of permittivity , which transforms the system to the full @xmath0-symmetric regime . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the light is attracted toward the center of each dimer ( where the permittivity is the highest ) , and due to the transverse momentum , light crosses the center and is mostly located in the loss region  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the light intensity and the nonlinear modification of permittivity decrease bringing the system back to the broken @xmath0-symmetric regime . </S>",
    "<S> this cycle repeats as shown in  [ fig : three_per_evo](a ) and the evolution of the @xmath47-coordinate of the center of mass ( com ) of the intensity distribution @xmath48 presented in  [ fig : three_per_evo](b ) . for the input beam energy chosen in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : three_per_evo](a )  and  ( b ) , the total power in the system increases 25 times during one cycle , and the period of the cycle is approximately equal to 1  mm . lowering the input power results in an increase of the propagation length required for the power to grow and initiate the oscillations , but the oscillation period and the maximum power remains approximately the same . on the contrary , an increase of the input power results in a decrease of the oscillation period ( down to @xmath49  mm ) and an increase ( @xmath50 times ) of the peak power </S>",

    "<S> +   +    shows nonlinear propagation of light in the multimode system studied in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : disp_multi3 ]  and  [ fig : three_per_evo ] , but this time instead of exciting a single ( gain ) mode , we excite a mixture of modes . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) shows the result of excitation with a wide gaussian beam illuminating all three dimers . </S>",
    "<S> this beam excites all the modes of the waveguide ( except the antisymmetric mode 2 ) , and these modes interfere during the propagation . </S>",
    "<S> this interference results in a doubly periodic light distribution pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the high frequency oscillations result from the interference of all the modes that have different effective indices . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we observe low frequency oscillations , that are the result of the nonlinear @xmath0  transition that couples light between the gain and the loss modes . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting pattern resembles the triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> a similar interference pattern is observed when a mixture of the fundamental mode and the gain mode are excited [ see [ fig : three_per_evo_mode12](b ) ] .    on the contrary , the excitation of the mixture of mode  2 and the gain mode results in a different interference pattern , as shown in [ fig : three_per_evo_mode12](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> mode  2 is mainly localized in the side waveguides [ see green curves in [ fig : disp_multi3](a ) ] ; therefore , the high frequency interference pattern is observed in these two waveguides only . </S>",
    "<S> the low frequency pattern attributed to the energy exchange between the gain and the loss mode is spread over all three waveguide dimers similar to earlier cases . here </S>",
    "<S> , the pattern is less regular than before and consists of an elongated maximum in the middle waveguide and a few shorter maxima in the side waveguides .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied nonlinear dynamics of light propagation in finite - size parity - time - symmetric couplers built of three dimers , and reported a new type of linear dispersion diagram @xmath51 for multimode systems built of several dimers , where the dispersion curves of higher - order mode pairs are enclosed in the dispersion curves of lower - order mode pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with the case of multimode single dimers , where the dispersion curves of higher - order modes appear below the curves corresponding to lower - order modes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the nonlinearly triggered transition from the full to the broken @xmath0-symmetric regime can be observed in such a system . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold for this @xmath0 transition was found to be higher in finite - size systems than for infinite periodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we predicted a variety of periodic patterns can be formed in the multimode coupler by controlling the initial excitation conditions . </S>"
