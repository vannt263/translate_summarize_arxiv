    "the x - ray source grs  1915 + 105 was discovered in 1992 with the watch instrument onboard granat ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "1992 ) . since _ rxte _ established continuous coverage in 1996 february",
    ", grs  1915 + 105 has never switched off completely .",
    "it was the first galactic object to show superluminal radio expansion ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) .",
    "it is located at a distance between 6 to 12.5 kpc ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ; fender et al .",
    "1999 ) . due to high extinction in the line of sight no optical study of grs 1915 + 105 has been possible and a near infrared counterpart has been suggested ( mirabel et al .",
    "1994 ; bor et al .",
    "no binary mass function or orbital period are known .",
    "the source is believed to host a black hole on the basis of its similarities to the dynamically proven black hole system gro 165540 ( orosz & bailyn 1997 ) and its x - ray luminosity , which is above the eddington limit for a neutron star .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of grs  1915 + 105 is also typical of black hole candidates , requiring two main components ( belloni et al .",
    "1997a ) : a power - law component which accounts for the high energy part of the spectrum and a thermal component ( multi - color black body ) which dominates at energies below 10 kev ( mitsuda et al . 1984 ) . at times ,",
    "only the power law component is observed ( trudolyubov , churazov , & gilfanov 1999 ; belloni et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "grs  1915 + 105 displays a remarkable richness in variability ( see e.g. greiner , morgan & remillard 1997 ) .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) modeled the main type of variations observed in this source as due to the onset of a thermal - viscous instability . in this framework , the intervals of low flux correspond to the non - observability of the innermost portion of the accretion disk . during three long ( 30 - 100 days ) periods in 1996 and 1997 , no strong flux variability was observed from grs  1915 + 105 . on the basis of an x - ray color analysis of the _",
    "rxte_/pca data , belloni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) interpreted these quiet periods as the result of the recovery from an instability that affected a larger portion of the accretion disk , combined with a relatively lower value of the accretion rate .",
    "detailed timing analysis of part of these observations has been presented by trudolyubov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "three different types of qpos have been identified in grs  1915 + 105 ( morgan , remillard & greiner 1997 ) . at higher frequencies a sharp ( @xmath0 20 )",
    "qpo with constant centroid frequency at 67 hz and whose rms amplitude increases with photon energy has been detected .",
    "this qpo has been proposed to arise in the inner accretion disk and its frequency is thought to reflect the properties of the black hole . at much lower frequencies ( 0.0010.1 hz ) ,",
    "the source occasionally shows high - amplitude qpos or brightness `` sputters '' .",
    "these variations probably correspond to a disk instability .",
    "the third class of qpos observed in grs  1915 + 105 comprises those detected in the frequency range 0.510 hz .",
    "they are linked to the properties of the accretion disk since their centroid frequency and fractional rms have been reported to correlate with the thermal flux ( markwardt , swank , & taam 1999 ; trudolyubov et al .",
    "1999 ) and apparent temperature ( muno , morgan , & remillard 1999 ) of the disk .",
    "these qpos are observed only during the low - flux intervals when , according to the model of the thermal - viscous instability , a portion of the inner accretion disk is not observable .",
    "a phase - lag analysis of the observation which showed the strongest signal at 67 hz was presented by cui ( 1999 ) : the 67 hz qpo shows a marked hard lag , while the low frequency ( well below 1 hz ) qpo shows a complex hard / soft lag structure .    in this paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the phase lags associated with the properties of the 0.510 hz qpo during two of the long quiet intervals mentioned above .",
    "the data used in this work were retrieved from the public _",
    "rxte _ archive and correspond to two different sets of observations .",
    "the first set took place between 1996 july 11 and 1996 august 18 and consists of 27 observation intervals ( obi ) .",
    "the second set comprises 16 observation intervals covering the period between 1997 september 29 and 1997 october 24 .",
    "these two sets of observations correspond to low - flux intervals in which the source did not display structured variability either in the pca or in the asm data ( belloni et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the journal of the _ rxte _ observations is given in table  [ observ ] .",
    "due to its low - earth orbit , _ rxte _ data consist of a number of contiguous data intervals ( typically 1 hour long ) interspersed with observational gaps produced by earth occultations of the source and passages of the satellite through the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "each observation interval was analysed separately and appear as different entries in table  [ observ ] .",
    "a suffix @xmath1 has been added to the data set identifiers accordingly .",
    "in order to study the source variability , we divided the 260 kev pca light curves ( no energy selection was made ) of each observation into 16 s segments and calculated the fourier power spectrum of each segment .",
    "the nyquist frequency was 256 hz for the first set of observations and 64 hz for the second .",
    "the contribution by the photon counting noise was computed and subtracted from each power spectrum .",
    "the power spectra were normalized such that their integral gives the squared fractional rms variability ( belloni & hasinger 1990 ) . the power spectra were then averaged together to produce one power spectrum for each observation interval .",
    "in all power spectra a strong band - limited noise component was present , together with one or more qpo peaks .",
    "we fitted the power spectra using a model that consisted of a broken power law and two lorentzian peaks , representing the band - limited noise continuum and the qpo plus its second harmonic , respectively . while all power spectra clearly showed one qpo peak , in some cases the second harmonic",
    "was not required .",
    "generally , the power spectra are characterized by a flat power - law below the qpo frequency ( @xmath2=0.10.3 ) and a steep power - law above the qpo ( @xmath2= 2.73.0 ) .",
    "the slope of the low - frequency power - law tends to increase with increasing qpo frequency . while the qpo frequency increases with count rate , its amplitude ( rms ) decreases ( fig  [ cs_qpo_rms ] ) .",
    "trudolyubov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found the same trend during the 1996 november1997 april low - flux period .",
    "the results of the power spectral fitting are given in table  [ observ ] .",
    "for each observation , we produced a phase - lag spectrum .",
    "we divided the data into two energy bands ( soft : 25 kev ; hard : 513 kev ) and produced a cross spectrum for every 16 s. the cross spectrum is defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the complex fourier coefficients for the two energy bands at a frequency @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the complex conjugate of @xmath8 ( van der klis et al .",
    "the phase lag between the signals in the two bands at fourier frequency @xmath6 is @xmath9 $ ] ( the position angle of @xmath10 in the complex plane ) and the corresponding time lag @xmath11 .",
    "we calculated an average cross vector @xmath12 by averaging the complex values over multiple adjacent 16 s spectra , and then finding the final value of @xmath13 vs. frequency .",
    "the error in @xmath13 is computed from the observed variance of @xmath12 in the real and imaginary directions .",
    "we limited our phase lag analysis to frequencies below 10 hz , well below the region where binning effects are important ( crary et al .",
    "1998 ) . in all phase lag spectra ,",
    "positive lag values mean that hard photons are lagging soft photons .",
    "no correction for dead - time effects in the phase lag spectra ( cross - talk between energy channels ) was done since this effect was found to be negligible .    in order to study the variability of the phase lags and its relationship with the properties of the qpo we obtained the mean phase lag spectrum by averaging the cross - correlation vectors in four different qpo frequency ranges , @xmath14 hz , @xmath15 hz , @xmath16 hz and @xmath17 hz .",
    "figure  [ pds_lag ] shows these four phase lag spectra together with a representative power spectrum of the group .",
    "one can see that both the lag at the qpo frequency , and the characteristic shape of the lag continuum vary drastically .",
    "a common feature of the lag spectra is the presence of a broad dip at around the qpo frequency . as the qpo frequency increases , its position relative to the dip changes .",
    "the frequency of the dip also varies although not as fast : at low qpo frequencies ( below 2 hz ) the qpo occurs slightly before the dip minimum , at qpo frequencies above 2 hz it occurs at around the dip minimum . at qpo frequencies",
    "@xmath18 hz a second dip at lower fourier frequency develops in the phase lag spectra .    at low values of the qpo frequency ,",
    "the continuum of the phase lag spectrum is curved and positive whereas at high and intermediate qpo frequencies the continuum is flatter and close to zero lag .",
    "averaging over the 0.060.6 hz range , that is , below any of the qpos , for the four cases shown in figure  [ pds_lag ] we find the following values of the phase lags : 0.215@xmath190.004 rad for @xmath20 @xmath21 1 hz , 0.159@xmath190.004 rad for 1 @xmath22 2 hz , 0.071@xmath190.004 rad for 2 @xmath23 3 hz and 0.024@xmath190.003 rad for @xmath24 3 hz .",
    "we also derived phase lags of the continuum and at the qpo frequency for each observation , by measuring the average vector in the frequency range 0.15 hz and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "@xmath26 is the fwhm of the qpo peak .",
    "the results were plotted as a function of qpo frequency and are shown in figure  [ freq_lag ] . a tight correlation between these quantities is found . as the qpo frequency ( or count rate ) increases the lag decreases , changing sign at around 2 hz .",
    "the opposite behavior was reported for gx 3994 by nowak et al .",
    "these authors found the shortest time delays at the lowest flux observation .",
    "the increase above 5 hz observed in figure  [ freq_lag ] ( bottom ) is due to the dip moving toward higher frequencies .",
    "this change in the sign of the lag means that at a certain point soft photons lag hard photons .",
    "similar results were obtained for the lags measured at the theoretical harmonics of the qpo frequency .",
    "the frequency at which the lags change from positive to negative are consistent with 4 , 6 and 8 hz , that is , 2 , 3 and 4 times that of the qpo ( 2 hz ) .    in figure  [ lag_ener ] ,",
    "the dependence of the phase lags ( at the qpo frequency ) on energy is plotted .",
    "different symbols correspond to three different values of the qpo frequency : squares for @xmath20=0.999 hz , dots for @xmath20=2.316 hz and stars for @xmath20=4.68 hz . the energy bands shown are 2.05.0 , 5.46.9 , 7.29.4 and 9.813.1 kev .",
    "the phase lag was obtained by taking the softest band as the reference band and by computing a cross - power spectrum between each of the energy bands and the reference band . at low frequencies ,",
    "the phase lags are positive and increase with energy ; at high frequencies the phase lags are negative and decrease with energy ; at intermediate frequencies the lags are zero and roughly constant .",
    "we also calculated background subtracted light curves corresponding to the following bands in pulse - height channels : 013 ( 2.0 - 5.0 kev , band a ) , 1435 ( 5.0 - 13.0 kev , band b ) and 36 - 100 ( 13.0 - 60.0 kev , band c ) and produced hard and soft colors as hr1 = b / a and hr2 = c / a , respectively . in figure  [ hr1_lag ] we have plotted the phase lags of the continuum ( 0.15 hz ) and the qpo frequency as a function of hr1 .",
    "the negative lags occur when the source is softer ( hr1 @xmath27 1.2 ) , whereas the hard lags are seen when the source spectrum is harder ( hr1 @xmath28 1.3 ) .",
    "a similar trend is obtained if the hard color hr2 is used .",
    "the anti - correlation between the qpo frequency and hr1 is a consequence of the anti - correlation of the colors with count rate .",
    "it is worth noting that no soft component is required to fit the energy spectrum in the observations presented here with the possible exception of the ones with the highest qpo frequency . during low - flux states in grs 1915 + 105",
    "the x - ray spectra are dominated by the power - law component .",
    "therefore , variations in hr1 correspond to variation in the power - law index . for a more detailed interpretation of x - ray colors in terms of spectral models ,",
    "see belloni et al .",
    "we have analysed _ rxte _ data of the superluminal source grs  1915 + 105 during two quiescent periods and measured lags of the 513 kev photons relative to the 25 kev photons .",
    "we have found that both positive and negative lags are present .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) have shown that the complex spectral and temporal variability of grs  1915 + 105 may be explained by the rapid removal and subsequent refilling of the inner region of the accretion disk .",
    "the quiescent state corresponds to the absence of this inner region and it is characterized by a relatively low count rate ( @xmath27 20000 _ rxte _ pca c / s ) , power - law dominated x - ray spectrum and the presence of 0.510 hz qpo .    in this state both",
    "the timing ( qpo frequency , lags ) and spectral parameters ( hardness ratios , temperature of disk ) correlate ( or anticorrelate ) with count rate .",
    "thus a selection according to qpo frequency implicitly implies a selection on spectral hardness or count rate .",
    "of special interest here are the properties of the 0.510 hz qpo ( centroid , amplitude ) , which are strongly correlated with the changes of spectral and timing parameters and can be summarized as follows : as the frequency of the qpo increases _",
    "i ) _ the flux of the soft component ( disk ) increases ( markwardt et al .",
    "1999 ) , _ ii ) _ the temperature of the accretion disk increases ( muno et al . 1999 ) , _ iii ) _ the fractional rms amplitude of the qpo decreases ( trudolyubov et al . 1999 ) . in this work",
    "we find that _ iv ) _ as the frequency of the qpo increases the lag between hard and soft photons decreases , changing sign for @xmath29 hz ( fig .",
    "[ freq_lag ] ) , _ v ) _ negative lags occur when the power - law spectrum is soft and positive lags when it is hard ( fig .",
    "[ hr1_lag ] ) , _ vi ) _ the 0.510 hz qpo disappears when the pca intensity is high ( @xmath28 20000 counts per second ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of black hole systems consist of a power - law component , thought to be caused by comptonization , plus a soft thermal component , which is modeled as a multi - temperature blackbody coming from an optically thick accretion disk .",
    "the relative strength of these components varies with x - ray flux in the 110 kev band . in the standard comptonization model only hard , i.e. positive lags , are expected .",
    "the initially low - frequency photons scatter off energetic electrons and gain energy .",
    "the larger the number of scatterings the higher the energy of the escaping photons and also the longer the time they spend in the comptonizing region .    in what follows",
    "we discuss a simple scenario which might , at least _",
    "qualitatively _ , account for the soft , i.e negative lags .",
    "let us consider a comptonizing region in which the comptonization process becomes more efficient closer to the black hole .",
    "one such situation could be , for example , a disk consisting of cold electrons with a keplerian distribution of velocities ( bulk comptonization ) or a hot corona with a temperature gradient , the inner parts being hotter than the outer parts ( thermal comptonization ) .",
    "let us examine the keplerian case .",
    "near the black hole , the rotational velocity of the electrons is close to the speed of light and those photons that find themselves in this region get up - scattered due to bulk - motion comptonization .",
    "note than in this model the comptonizing region is the accretion disk itself .",
    "the source of soft photons can be inside ( the disk itself ) or outside the disk .",
    "what is needed is that some photons find their way to the high - velocity parts of the disk .",
    "preliminary results of this type of comptonization have been reported by kylafis & reig ( 1999 ) .    if the optical depth is small , the majority of the input photons escape after a few scatterings . in this case",
    "the photons that undergo some scatterings ( hard photons ) lag soft photons .",
    "but if the optical depth is large , the soft input photons undergo a random - walk through the medium prior to escape and gain energy .",
    "some of these now hard photons find themselves in the outer parts of the comptonizing region where the velocity of the electrons is low and they begin to give away energy by means of the direct compton effect .",
    "we expect then that soft photons lag hard photons . in order for such downward scattering to occur",
    "the optical depth must be large and the disk must be geometrically thick so that the photons sample a large fraction of the comptonizing medium .",
    "if we accept that the optical depth gives a measure of the mass accretion rate and that , in turn , larger accretion rates imply higher count rates , then this simple model may also explain the dependence of the lag sign on intensity .",
    "positive lags occur when the count rate is low , whereas negative lags are detected for high count rates ( this observational fact can be inferred from fig  [ cs_qpo_rms ] and [ freq_lag ] ) .",
    "low intensity , that is low mass accretion rate , implies low optical depth , hence up - scattering only or equivalently , positive lags .",
    "high intensity implies large accretion rates or large optical depths and therefore diffusion plus down - scattering , opening up the posibility of negative lags .",
    "given the relatively short time lags ( of the order of a few milliseconds ) the comptonizing region does not need to be very large ( a few tens of gravitational radii , @xmath30 ) .",
    "note also , that the negative time lags are typically an order of magnitude shorter than the positive lags .",
