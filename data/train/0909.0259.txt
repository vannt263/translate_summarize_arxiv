    "the concentration of particles to high spatial densities promotes the formation of planetesimals , the super - kilometer scale building blocks of planets .",
    "drag forces on pebbles and rocks in disks lead to spontaneous particle clumping @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a linear streaming instability @xcite shows that clumping is a robust consequence of particles drifting in and gas flowing out in disks with some radial pressure support @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the non - linear saturation of the streaming instability , neglecting vertical gravity and self - gravity .",
    "those simulations showed that groups of boulders accelerate the gas around them towards the keplerian velocity , reducing the radial drift locally and leading to temporary concentrations of boulders ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite recently performed three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations of vertical shear instabilities in keplerian disks in the single fluid limit where particles and gas have exactly the same velocities .",
    "these studies confirmed expectations that mid - plane turbulence develops when the richardson number @xmath0 .",
    "while perfect coupling is a good approximation for small grains , it can not include vertical settling or in - plane streaming motions .",
    "in this letter we present 3d simulations of the motion of gas and pebbles in sub - keplerian disks , including vertical gravity and particle sedimentation .",
    "thus , we can study the combined effect of vertical shearing and streaming instabilities , as particles self - consistently settle towards  and are stirred from  the mid - plane .",
    "we exclude external sources of turbulence , including magnetorotational instabilities ( which can actually promote clumping , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our hydrodynamical simulations offer a first approximation to dead zones with low ionization @xcite where turbulent surface layers drive only weak motions in the mid - plane @xcite .    in this non - magnetized limit ,",
    "we investigate the clumping of smaller particles than considered in @xcite , which increases the likelihood of coagulation up to the initial sizes .",
    "we find that clumping of pebbles in the mid - plane layer increases sharply above a threshold mass fraction of solids roughly consistent with solar metallicity .",
    "thus planetesimal formation may help explain the high probability of finding giant exoplanets around stars rich in heavy elements @xcite .",
    "we perform 3d hybrid simulations . they model gas on a fixed grid and solids with superparticles , each representing a swarm of actual particles .",
    "we solve the standard shearing sheet dynamical equations for a frame rotating at the keplerian frequency @xmath1 at a fixed orbital distance @xmath2 from the star .",
    "the axes are oriented such that @xmath3 points radially outwards , @xmath4 points in the orbital direction , while @xmath5 points vertically out of the disk .",
    "the gas is subject to a global radial pressure gradient that reduces the gas orbital speed by @xmath6ms@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the sound speed @xmath8 , gas scale height @xmath9 and mid - plane gas density @xmath10 are the natural units of the simulation .",
    "the motion of gas and particles are coupled through momentum - conserving drag forces with particle friction time @xmath11 .",
    "our dynamical equations are identical to those of @xcite , with the addition of a vertical gravitational acceleration @xmath12 affecting both gas and particles .",
    "the superparticles are evenly distributed in mass and number into four bins of normalized friction time @xmath13 .",
    "these friction times are characteristic of compact solids with radius @xmath14 cm at @xmath15 in the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite .",
    "rescaling to @xmath16 yields @xmath174  cm . we colloquially refer to this range of particle sizes as pebbles to contrast with larger @xmath18 boulders .",
    "the total pebble mass is fixed by setting the pebble - to - gas column density ratio @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mean particle and gas column densities , taking into account that most of the gas resides beyond the vertical extent of the simulation box .",
    "this pebble abundance turns out to be the crucial parameter for triggering particle clumping .",
    "the total abundance of condensable materials beyond the ice line was estimated by @xcite to be @xmath22 , while more up - to - date models give a somewhat lower value of @xmath23 at temperatures less than 41 k @xcite . for our models",
    "a greater uncertainty is the efficiency of conversion from dust grains to pebbles . assuming that a majority ( @xmath24 ) of the condensable solids are bound in pebbles",
    ", @xmath25 corresponds to solar metallicity .",
    "we also experiment with higher values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which are motived both by stars with super - solar metallicities and by mechanisms that enrich the solids - to - gas ratio in disks ( see  [ sec : conc ] ) .",
    "a given pebble abundance would correspond to higher values of the metallicity if pebbles make up a smaller fraction of the condensable material .",
    "we use a box size of @xmath28 and resolutions of @xmath29 zones with 125,000 particles , and @xmath30 zones with 1,000,000 particles .",
    "this relatively small box size is chosen to capture typical wavelengths of streaming and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "the gas density is in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "particle positions are initialized to give a gaussian density distribution around the mid - plane with scale height @xmath31 , while gas and particle velocities are initially set to match the drag force equilibrium solution of @xcite .",
    "since the disk is initially laminar , particles settle to the disk mid - plane . as particles collect in the mid - plane , they accelerate gas there towards the keplerian orbital speed .",
    "this generates vertical shear that can drive kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "the velocity difference between gas and solids also triggers streaming instabilities .",
    "the resulting turbulence halts particle sedimentation and can lead to clumping .    in fig .",
    "[ f : sigmapmx_t ] we show results for pebble abundances @xmath25 ( roughly solar ) , @xmath26 ( super - solar ) and @xmath27 ( strongly super - solar ) .",
    "the @xmath25 simulation shows minimal clumping , but reveals instead a surprising interaction between settling and stirring .",
    "the particle layer is not centered uniformly on the mid - plane , as usually assumed .",
    "instead the solids organize in a wave - like pattern ( top left panel of fig .  [",
    "f : sigmapmx_t ] ) produced by coherent vertical oscillations combined with radial drift .",
    "we note that the streaming instability is known to drive coherent vertical motions in clumps of boulders @xcite .",
    "the characteristic particle density @xmath32 is high enough to exert feedback on the gas .",
    "however the average mid - plane density @xmath33 is diluted by the voids in the wave - like pattern , and is too small to trigger strong radial clumping .    increasing the pebble abundance to @xmath26 and @xmath27 triggers strong overdensities in the particle layer ( see fig .  [",
    "f : sigmapmx_t ] ) .",
    "initially , streaming instabilities produce many azimuthally extended clumps in the simulation box .",
    "since the denser clumps drift inward more slowly , mergers result in a single dominant clump .",
    "the characteristic particle density increases due to the strong clumping , with @xmath34 for @xmath35 , respectively . the maximum density in the box increases from less than ten to",
    "more than 2,000 times the gas density when the pebble abundance is increased from @xmath25 to @xmath36 .",
    "so why does the clumping increase so sharply for order unity changes to the pebble abundance @xmath37 ?",
    "[ f : sigmapmx_t ] ( top panels ) shows that the vertical extent of the wave - shaped particle layer decreases with @xmath37 , because less kinetic energy is released in particle - dominated flows @xcite . consequently the average mid - plane particle density increases , with @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "strong clumping is thus expected for the higher metallicity cases , because the streaming instability is more powerful  for linear growth and nonlinear clumping  when the average @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "a runaway develops as clumping limits stirring , giving higher average densities and in turn more clumping .",
    "we can estimate the transitional value @xmath41 above which particles strongly clump .",
    "assume that the sub - layer thickness is set by vertical shear turbulence to be @xmath42 as appropriate for small particles @xcite .",
    "then the clumping threshold @xmath43 requires @xmath44 for @xmath45 this yields a critical pebble abundance of @xmath46 .",
    "the slight overestimate of @xmath41 may arise because our pebbles settle more effectively than small grains .",
    "the result that clumping happens for lower @xmath37 when @xmath47 is smaller ( weaker radial pressure support ) is seen in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "the same metallicity threshold arises in particle layers with constant richardson number @xcite . above @xmath41 a high density cusp forms in the mid - plane because the shear turbulence can not lift solids with mass exceeding the local gas mass @xcite .",
    "vertical self - gravity causes the analytic cusps to diverge , while streaming instabilities are responsible for the strong clumping in our dynamical simulations .",
    "the growth of solids into planetesimals depends on collision speeds , which affect the rates of fragmentation and coagulation @xcite .",
    "the threshold speed for catastrophic destruction of a meter - scale body , with the material strength of compact rock , is around 10ms@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "porous aggregates , with less material strength , have an even lower threshold for destruction .",
    "sticking of equal - sized bodies @xmath48 mm is not observed .",
    "however , small grains can adhere at speeds less than @xmath49ms@xmath7 @xcite .    from our simulation snapshots we measured relative speeds of all particle pairs within the same grid cell , giving @xmath50 unique collisions in a grid cell with @xmath51 particles .",
    "all collisions are assumed to be head on ; for a random distribution of impact parameters the normal velocity would be reduced by 50% compared to the relative speed .",
    "we averaged over snapshots taken between 30 and 50 orbits of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 runs with @xmath26 .",
    "the distribution of collision speeds between particles of various sizes is shown in fig .  [",
    "f : vcoll ] .",
    "we weight the occurrence of relative speeds by the speed itself to reflect that high speed collisions take place more frequently than low speed collisions .",
    "the typical collision speed lies in the interval 0.55ms@xmath7 for a sound speed @xmath52ms@xmath7 .",
    "[ f : vcoll ] also shows that the collision speed is systematically lower in the denser particle clumps where the typical speed falls to less than 2ms@xmath7 . averaging collision speeds without weighting by the speed itself leads to much lower typical speeds , around 0.22ms@xmath7 .",
    "the low collision speeds are surprising given the sub - keplerian speed of 25ms@xmath7 .",
    "the differential radial drift alone is 12.7ms@xmath7 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 test particles .",
    "however , the large bodies reside in dense clumps in the mid - plane layer where the differential radial drift is much reduced and the turbulence is weakened by mass loading ( see insert in fig .  [",
    "f : vcoll ] ) .    in simulations of particles in magnetorotational turbulence ,",
    "collision speeds are measured to be much higher , of order @xmath5510ms@xmath7 ( and well beyond for different - sized particles , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the more benign collision environment in the current simulations is more resistant to destruction and may even allow for growth by sticking .",
    "low random velocities in high density clumps also favor gravitational collapse on a much shorter time - scale .",
    "collective gravity can act to assemble solid particles into planetesimals @xcite .",
    "the clumps in our @xmath26 and @xmath27 simulations reach densities beyond the roche density , @xmath56 so self - gravity will be dynamically relevant .",
    "we activate the self - gravity in a @xmath26 simulation that already developed for @xmath55@xmath57 orbits , starting at a chosen time that displayed relatively weak clumping .",
    "a few orbits later a dense filament forms due to the streaming instability , but the concurrent action of the self - gravity leads to the condensation of seven gravitationally bound objects ( see fig .",
    "[ f : planetesimals ] ) .",
    "initially the planetesimals actively accrete pebbles from their surroundings .",
    "however , the accretion slows down after 5 orbits as 20% of the solid mass is locked in seven clumps with masses corresponding to solid bodies of radii between 100 and 200 km .",
    "further growth can occur both by accreting dust and pebbles and by planetesimal - planetesimal impacts , since the modest gas density fluctuations in mid - plane layer turbulence can not pump collision speeds of large planetesimals into the erosive regime @xcite .",
    "in this letter we present numerical evidence that the streaming instability , which arises in the coupled motion of gas and solids , can alone provide the necessary ingredients for the formation of planetesimals . with a high enough abundance of pebble - sized objects",
    ", the streaming instability drives the formation of high - density clumps in the sedimented mid - plane layer .",
    "collision speeds inside those clumps are relatively low , around a few meters per second .",
    "the clumps get dense enough to contract gravitationally on a short time - scale into gravitationally bound clusters containing mass equivalent to solid planetesimals with radii of order 100 km .",
    "our simulations display a threshold dependence of clumping on the global value of the pebble abundance . at a pebble abundance of @xmath25 , corresponding roughly to solar metallicity , powerful turbulence develops and puffs up the mid - plane layer to such widths that clumping is strongly suppressed .",
    "this environment is not conducive to planetesimal growth , with low particle densities and high collision speeds .",
    "however , a doubling of the pebble abundance to @xmath26 leads to strong clumping with local peak particle densities exceeding a thousand times the gas density .",
    "this threshold behavior arises because the streaming instability triggers strong clumping when the particle density exceeds the gas density in the mid - plane .",
    "if the fraction of condensables contained in pebbles is less than we assumed in this discussion ( approximately @xmath58 ) , then the threshold we describe corresponds to higher values of the bulk metallicity .",
    "coagulation - fragmentation models @xcite and observations of pebbles in protoplanetary discs @xcite will be crucial for putting tighter constraints on the pebble abundance and the location of the metallicity switch .",
    "the pebble abundance may increase as solid particles drift radially inward , converging in the inner few dozen aus of the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "a higher @xmath37 also will occur if the gas in the disk preferentially evaporates .",
    "for example , photoevaporation removes gas from the disk surface , leaving behind larger solids that have sedimented to the mid - plane @xcite .",
    "this opens a window for late planet formation with planetesimals forming as the gas dissipates .",
    "the planets resulting from planetesimals formed so late will not have time enough to accrete a large gaseous envelope before the gas dissipates and would also suffer less severe type i migration @xcite .",
    "this could explain why super - earths and exo - neptunes seem able to form equally well around stars of low and high metallicity @xcite .",
    "the correlation between host star metallicity and giant exoplanets can be partly attributed to the efficiency of forming several - earth - mass cores from planetesimals @xcite .",
    "our findings show that high metallicity already facilitates planetesimal formation , giving further support to the core accretion model for giant planet formation @xcite .",
    "computer simulations were performed at the huygens cluster in amsterdam , funded by the nwo , and at the pia cluster of the max planck institute for astronomy .",
