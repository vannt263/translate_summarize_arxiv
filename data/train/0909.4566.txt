    "studies of the contact between a spherical tip and a flat substrate have played a central role in models of the mechanical and frictional response of surfaces . in continuum mechanics , this geometry can be mapped into contact between two peaks or asperities on opposing rough surfaces as they are pressed together  @xcite .",
    "the response of the entire system is then commonly represented as a sum over many independent contacts  @xcite , although recent studies emphasize the importance of interactions between asperities  @xcite .",
    "ideal single asperity contacts are difficult to realize in experiments because both the tip and substrate are usually rough on scales smaller than the average radius of curvature . as a result , most experiments with micrometer and larger tips end up measuring the response of many smaller asperities .",
    "notable exceptions are experiments on atomically flat mica surfaces in the surface force apparatus  @xcite .",
    "the main limitation of these experiments is that the contact pressure is typically only tens of megapascals , which is orders of magnitude smaller than estimates of the pressure between asperities on rough surfaces .    in the last twenty years",
    "there has been great interest in the study of single asperities at the nanometer scale using the atomic force microscope ( afm ) and related scanning probes  @xcite .",
    "when the afm is operated in a typical contact mode , a tip with characteristic radius of @xmath1 to @xmath2 nm is pressed into contact with a surface and may be translated to measure the friction .",
    "the small dimensions of the tip allow more direct control and/or measurement of the chemistry and geometry , and reduce the range of roughness that can exist on the surfaces .",
    "afm experiments provide direct information about the normal and lateral forces , but do not reveal the distribution of forces within the contact , the area of contact , or the mechanisms of deformation and friction .",
    "this prevents them from directly answering long standing questions about the role of area and load in determining friction . at the macroscopic scale , amontons",
    "s laws of friction say that the friction is proportional to load and independent of the area of contact .",
    "however a prevailing view since the mid 1900 s has been that the friction is proportional to the real area of molecular contact @xmath3 , which is much smaller than the nominal or apparent area  @xcite .",
    "the real area typically grows linearly with load for nonadhesive surfaces , and amontons s laws are recovered if there is a constant shear stress @xmath4 in the contact . for adhesive surfaces , @xmath3 remains finite at zero load , explaining why friction is often finite at zero load .    to try to address the role of @xmath3 at the nanometer scale , afm experiments",
    "have been compared to continuum models .",
    "the measured friction can be fit by assuming both that continuum theory describes @xmath3 in nanometer scale contacts and that there is a constant @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "however , the success of such fits need not imply that the underlying assumptions are valid , because the functional dependence is quite simple and there are many poorly constrained fit parameters .",
    "this has been demonstrated in subsequent simulations where the friction can be fit in the same way , but both assumptions break down  @xcite .",
    "the major cause of the discrepancy with continuum theory is the atomic scale roughness that is present on any surface composed of discrete atoms .",
    "this spreads the contact over a larger area , much as predicted by continuum calculations for rough surfaces  @xcite .",
    "these simulations of single asperity contacts between clean surfaces have found a variety of relations between @xmath3 , load and friction .",
    "the friction changes by more than two orders of magnitude with the precise atomic structure of the tip  @xcite , and may scale linearly with area , load or neither  @xcite .",
    "similar strong dependence on atomic structure is found for the friction between flat surfaces , with friction expected to vanish with increasing area unless the surfaces are commensurate , i.e. , share a common period  @xcite .",
    "of course experimental surfaces are rarely clean . any surface exposed to air",
    "is rapidly coated with adsorbed molecules of water , oxygen or small hydrocarbons .",
    "wear debris , dust and larger particles may also be present .",
    "these `` third bodies '' can have a profound effect on friction .",
    "studies of flat surfaces show that they greatly reduce the sensitivity of friction to atomic structure and produce a friction force that rises linearly with normal load  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the effect of adsorbed monolayers on the mechanical properties and friction of single asperity contacts .",
    "even though the adsorbed molecules freely diffuse along the surface , they are trapped in a glassy state when confined under the tip and remain in the contact at very high loads . as for flat surfaces ,",
    "the adsorbed monolayer decreases the variation of friction with atomic structure and yields a force that usually rises linearly with normal load .",
    "the adsorbed monolayer also decreases variations with tip structure in the contact area and normal stiffness , but leads to large deviations from the results for bare tips . the observed increase in contact area and decrease in stiffness relative to continuum theory",
    "are qualitatively consistent with modeling the adsorbed monolayer as a thin elastic coating .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii describes the interactions , geometry and methods used in our simulations .",
    "the md results for the pressure distribution , contact radius , tip displacement , and friction forces are presented in sec .",
    "iv provides a brief summary and discussion of the results .",
    "figure [ atomicconfig ] shows a snapshot of the system studied in our md simulations . a spherical tip is pushed , under a controlled normal load , into a flat substrate covered with an adsorbed fluid layer .",
    "the picture only shows a small region near the center of contact ( about @xmath5 in the plane of the substrate surface and @xmath6 in the substrate depth ) .",
    "the tip radius is @xmath7 , which is comparable to radii of tips used in afm experiments .",
    "the geometry also approximates contact of peaks on randomly rough surfaces .        in continuum mechanics a contact between two elastic , frictionless spheres , with radii @xmath8 and @xmath9 ,",
    "young s moduli @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and poisson ratios @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , can be mapped to a contact between a rigid sphere of radius @xmath14 and a flat elastic solid of modulus @xmath15 given by  @xcite @xmath16 previous studies have shown that the mapping remains essentially correct at atomic scales  @xcite .",
    "thus simulations can be simplified to the case of a rigid tip and an elastic substrate without loss of generality .    to approximate a perfectly elastic material ,",
    "we take a face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) crystal as the substrate with a ( 001 ) surface exposed .",
    "atoms on nearest - neighbor sites in the substrate are connected by a harmonic potential @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a spring constant , @xmath19 is the equilibrium distance between two nearest neighbors , and @xmath20 is the inter - atomic distance . to be consistent with our previous work ,",

    "if atoms in the solid interacted with this potential and the cutoff only included nearest - neighbors , then one would have @xmath26 and @xmath18 approximately @xmath27 .",
    "we use these values for the spring interaction described in eq .",
    "( [ springpotential ] ) and express all quantities in terms of @xmath24 , @xmath23 and the mass of solid atoms @xmath28 .",
    "for example , the unit of time is @xmath29 .",

    "( [ effectivemodulus ] ) and the elastic constants is complicated when the solid is cubic rather than isotropic  @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath30 was obtained from fits to simulation results for the normal displacement in contacts between a bare fcc crystal and a dense tip where continuum theory is most accurate  @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 directions , i.e. , in the substrate surface plane .",
    "the bottom layer of substrate atoms is held fixed .",
    "this mimics the external support that balances the normal load applied to the tip .",
    "continuum solutions assume a semi - infinite substrate . to approximate this , all dimensions of the substrate",
    "should be much bigger than the contact radius .",
    "the size of the substrate used in this paper is about @xmath33 , which corresponds to a total of more than @xmath34 million atoms .",
    "the contact radius in our md simulations , as measured by the second moment of the pressure distribution , is less than @xmath35 of the substrate dimensions .",
    "the quantity most affected by finite substrate size is the normal displacement .",
    "the magnitude of the corrections to the hertz prediction has been obtained by fitting continuum calculations  @xcite to simulations for bare contacts  @xcite .",
    "the corrections are less than @xmath36 and have been included in the hertz prediction lines for normal displacement below .",
    "we perform a series of simulations using tips with different atomic scale structures and roughness , but with the same radius ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the smoothest tips are made by bending the ( 001 ) surface of an fcc crystal with nearest - neighbor spacing @xmath38 into a spherical shape .",
    "the friction between bare surfaces depends on whether @xmath39 is rational or irrational .",
    "these cases are referred to as commensurate and incommensurate , respectively .",
    "the highest friction occurs for commensurate surfaces with the same lattice constant and orientation , i.e. , @xmath40 . in this commensurate case , we find that the relative position of the tip on the substrate surface plays an important role .",
    "two extreme cases are investigated here .",
    "when tip atoms are directly above interstitial positions on the substrate surface , we say the tip is in registry since it represents a continuation of the crystalline structure of the substrate .",
    "on the other hand , when tip atoms are directly above atomic equilibrium positions on the substrate surface , we say the tip is out of registry .",
    "contacting experimental surfaces are rarely in perfect registry and alignment .",
    "any mismatch between lattice constants ( @xmath19 and @xmath38 ) or misalignment between lattice orientations leads to incommensurate contact . to model such cases , we make an incommensurate tip by bending a fcc crystal with @xmath41 .",
    "to most closely approximate a continuum , we also consider a dense tip made by bending a ( 001 ) face of a fcc crystal with @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "the two give nearly identical results for contact area and normal displacements .",
    "frictional forces are small for dense tips and are not reported because such disparate lattice constants on opposing surfaces are hard to realize with real atoms .",
    "the tips used in afm experiments are unlikely to have the geometry of bent crystals . to generate more realistic tip geometries we take a crystalline or amorphous material and remove all atoms outside a sphere of radius @xmath44 .",
    "the crystalline state is chosen to be commensurate with @xmath45 .",
    "the amorphous state is obtained by quenching a fluid state with number density @xmath46 .",
    "while all tips considered here deviate from an ideal sphere by less than an atomic diameter , the effective roughness is quite different .",
    "the cut crystal has terraced steps on the surface and will be referred to as the `` stepped '' tip in this paper .",
    "the amorphous surface does not have terraces , but has fluctuations in height and density ( see fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .    as for the bent commensurate tip ,",
    "results for the stepped tip depend on registry . for most of the results presented in this paper",
    "the stepped tip is out - of - registry , with the atoms in the bottom terrace directly above the equilibrium positions of surface substrate atoms .",
    "another case was considered in simulations of friction , because sliding along the @xmath31 axis brings commensurate tips between the in and out of registry configurations .",
    "the tip was shifted diagonally by @xmath47 along both @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "tip atoms then slide along a line that is centered between substrate atoms .",
    "this did not change static contact properties significantly , but lowered the friction by a factor of @xmath48 .",
    "atoms in the tip ( @xmath49 ) and substrate ( @xmath50 ) interact via the lj potential described in eq .",
    "( [ ljpotential ] ) with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",

    "previous studies have shown that this coarse - grained model provides a good description of short - chain hydrocarbon molecules  @xcite , and it has been used successfully to model a wide range of equilibrium and nonequilibrium behavior  @xcite .",
    "the monolayer is confined onto the substrate by an lj potential with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the stronger binding energy @xmath65 gives perfect wetting and , combined with the chain length , leads to a very low vapor pressure .",

    "the tip plows through the film and the force peaks remain roughly twice the height of those at @xmath232 .    for both the in and out of registry bent commensurate tips",
    ", the sliding path takes atoms on the tip directly over atoms in the substrate .",
    "this is why the frictional forces are identical as long as the film is either present or absent for both tips .",
    "previous work has shown that the friction on commensurate tips changes as the line of motion is displaced perpendicularly to the sliding direction  @xcite . to illustrate the effect of perpendicular shifts ,",

    "while the friction varies with tip geometry , the deviations are much smaller than those observed for bare tips .",
    "for the same tips , the friction in bare contacts varied by two orders of magnitude and showed different functional dependencies on load . inserting the adsorbed layer",
    "has greatly reduced this sensitivity to tip geometry , and the variation is even smaller if the special case of commensurate tips moved directly over substrate atoms is removed .",
    "in addition , the tips all exhibit a roughly linear rise in friction with load , although there are transitions in behavior for some tip geometries .",
    "for example the friction on the stepped tip increases more rapidly when the film is expelled from the central terrace ( @xmath236 ) , while the friction on the amorphous tip increases less rapidly with load when the film is damaged ( @xmath237 ) .    in these and previous simulations the largest static friction",
    "is observed for the commensurate case where the opposing surfaces have the same period and orientation .",
    "this case also typically yields a linear relation between @xmath197 and load .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the surfaces are effectively in hard - sphere contact and the tip must be lifted up over atoms in the layer below before it can slide forward  @xcite .",
    "the friction provides the force needed to move the tip up the ramp formed by these atoms and the slope of the ramp gives @xmath238 .",
    "the slope is largest for the commensurate case because the effect of all atoms adds coherently .",
    "the slope is also larger when the tip atoms pass directly over the substrate atoms rather than passing between them as for the stepped tip simulations . for incommensurate and amorphous surfaces , the forces average to zero for bare , infinite surfaces .",
    "this cancellation is prevented by the adsorbed film because it adopts a glassy state that adapts to the structure of both tip and substrate  @xcite .",

    "in particular , the static friction on the amorphous and incommensurate tips increased sublinearly and the stepped tip showed discontinuous jumps in friction .",

    "we conclude that when a film is present the friction force is more strongly connected to normal load than area of contact .",
    "a single fluid monolayer was shown to have a significant impact on the mechanical properties of single - asperity contacts . although the molecules diffused rapidly on an isolated substrate , they entered a glassy state when confined under the tip . as a result",
