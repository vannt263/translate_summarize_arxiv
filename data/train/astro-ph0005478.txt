    "binary black hole systems ( bbhss ) are expected to be common in the universe as a result of mergers between galaxies . in the underlying picture for the morphological evolution",
    ", galaxies were formed as part of a hierarchical clustering process ( e.g. white  1997 ) .",
    "giant elliptical galaxies , such as the host galaxy of mkn  501 , appear to be the products of mergers between spiral galaxies ( cf .",
    "fritze v.- alvensleben  1996 ) . since the brightest galaxies generally seem to contain massive black holes in their nuclei ( e.g. rees  1984 ; kormendy & richstone  1995 ; ho  1998 ; magorrian et al .  1998",
    "; richstone et al .",
    "1998 ) , merging would naturally lead to the formation of massive bbhs ( begelman et al .",
    "1980 , abbreviated : bbr  80 ; rees  1994 ; artymowicz  1998 ; richstone  1998 ) .",
    "the so formed binary black hole is expected to spent most of its time at a separation of @xmath4 pc for masses of @xmath5 ( bbr  80 ) . however if the binary looses further angular momentum e.g. by slingshot interaction with new stars from subsequent merging events ( roos  1988 ; roos et al .",
    "1993 ) , infall of gas ( bbr  80 ; cf . also gould & rix  2000 ) or by interactions with an accretion disk ( ivanov et al .",
    "1999 ) , gravitational radiation will eventually become important and the binary evolution could proceed rapidly to coalescence .    up to now , several phenomena have been attributed to bbhss : e.g. misalignment ( cf .",
    "conway & wrobel  1995 ) , precession ( bbr  80 ) or wiggling of jets , where the latter is supposed to be induced by the orbital motion ( kaastra & roos  1992 ; roos et al .",
    "periodic outburst activity in the quasar oj  287 , has commonly been related to a bbhs and is thought to arise due to tidal perturbation ( sillanp et al .",
    "1988 ) or due to one black hole crossing the accretion disk of the other ( letho & valtonen  1996 ) .",
    "other bbhs scenarios assume a pair of bent jets ( villata et al .  1998 ) or",
    "the precession of the disk under the gravitational torque ( katz  1997 ) .    in the particular case of mkn  501 ,",
    "the complex morphology of its radio jet and the peculiar behaviour of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) have prompted elaborate models relating these properties to a bbhs : conway & wrobel  ( 1995 ) , for example , have proposed a saturated helix model in order to explain the misalignement of the radio jet on parsec and kiloparsec scales .",
    "villata & raiteri  ( 1999 ) have argued that the x - ray variations in the sed of mkn  501 might be due solely to the changing orientation of a helical synchrotron emitting jet in a close bbhs .",
    "the recent discovery of periodicity in the tev and x - ray fluxes believed to be associated with moving features in the jet of mkn  501 might add another aspect for assessing the relevance of a bbhs in this galaxy .",
    "mkn  501 is one of at least four active galactic nuclei which have been detected at tev energies ( for review , see catanese & weekes  1999 ) .",
    "being the second closed among these with a redshift of @xmath6 , mkn  501 has been historically classified as an x - ray selected bl lac object showing virtually no emission lines , and is hosted by the elliptical galaxy ugc 10599 ( stickel at al .",
    "1993 ) . as a bl lac object",
    ", mkn  501 belongs to the blazar class of agn which are thought to have relativistic jets oriented at a small viewing angle , thus yielding a strong doppler enhancement of the observed flux .    at the beginning of 1997 ,",
    "mkn  501 had suddenly undergone a phase of high activity becoming the brightest source in the sky at tev energies .",
    "subsequent multiwavelength campaigns revealed a variable , two component sed with a low energy part extending up to @xmath7 kev ( pian et al .",
    "1998 ) and a high energy part which extends at least up to 20 tev ( samuelson et al .  1998 ; konopelko  1999 ) . during this activity phase ,",
    "particular types of variability have been observed ( e.g. protheroe et al . 1998 ) , consisting of flaring episodes of several days and additional intraday - variabilities .",
    "while the tev and x - rays variations seem to be well correlated , the evidence for correlations with the optical u - band appears to be rather weak ( e.g. catanese et al  1997 ; djannati - atai et al .",
    "1999 ; aharonian et al .",
    "one of the most fascinating features is the observed periodicity in the tev region with a period in the range of @xmath8 days , which has been found in the data taken by several cherenkov telescopes ( see protheroe et al .",
    "1998 ; hayashida et al .  1998 ) .",
    "additionally , a recently performed analysis of rxte - asm x - ray data from april to july 1997 also seems to support a periodicity of @xmath9 days ( kranich et al .  1999 ; nishikawa et al .",
    "1999 ) .    here",
    ", we speculate on the possibility that this periodicity in the flaring state arises due to the orbital motion of the relativistic jet in a bbhs where the nonthermal radiation is emitted by a relativistic jet which emerges from the less massive black hole , the periodicity thus being due mainly to geometrical origin ( i.e. doppler - shifted modulation ) .",
    "consider a simple binary model for mkn  501 , where the binary orbit is is assumed to be circular because dynamical friction between two parent galaxies during the merger might ensure that the initial eccentricity of the resulting binary is small ( e.g. polnarev & rees  1994 ) . using kepler s third law , the intrinsic orbital frequency @xmath10 of a binary with separation @xmath11 is given by @xmath12where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the mass of the smaller and the larger hole , respectively , and @xmath15 is the gravitational constant .    let us further assume that the observed jet is formed by the less massive black hole and that the nonthermal x - ray and @xmath16-ray radiation in the flaring state is emitted by a relativistic emission region ( e.g. knot , blob , shock ) which propagates outwards from the core along the jet with gamma factor @xmath17 .",
    "owing to the ( non - relativistic ) orbital motion , the true trajectory of the knot is a long stretched helix .",
    "the modulation of the emission then occurs as a consequence of the slight variation of the inclination angle @xmath18 due to the orbital @xmath19-component of the velocity field of the knot .",
    "this observed flux modulation by doppler boosting is well - known and can be written in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spectral flux density measured in the comoving frame , @xmath22)$ ] the doppler factor , @xmath23 is the actual angle between the velocity @xmath24 of the emission region and the direction of the observer , and where the final equality holds if the source has a spectral index @xmath25 .    due to the orbital motion around the center - of - mass , the doppler factor for the emission region",
    "is a periodical function of time . in the simplest case where the angle between the jet axis and the direction of the total angular momentum of the binary is assumed to be zero ( e.g. neglecting any kind of precessional motion ) the doppler factor",
    "may be written as @xmath26with @xmath27 being the centre - of - mass distance , @xmath28 the outflow velocity in the direction of the total angular momentum , @xmath18 the inclination between the jet axis and the line of sight and @xmath29 the velocity of light .",
    "obviously , the doppler factor becomes maximal for @xmath30 and minimal for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the keplerian period .    from the tev flux ratio of @xmath33 between the maximum and the minimum state during the observation ( cf .",
    "protheroe et al .",
    "1998 ; hayashida et al .  1998 ,",
    "aharonian et al .  1999 ) and the assumption that the periodicity arise in the main due to geometrical origin , we now obtain the condition @xmath34 ( see eq .",
    "( [ modulo ] ) ) .",
    "consequently , by using eq .",
    "( [ doppler ] ) one finds @xmath35    for a source region which moves in the time interval @xmath36 from point @xmath37 to point @xmath38 with relativistic velocity @xmath28 and at an angle @xmath39 to the line of sight , the observed difference in arrival times for radiation emitted at @xmath37 and @xmath38 is generally given by @xmath40 , thus leading to a shortening of the observed time interval .",
    "along this line of argument , one may easily derive that the observer in the model presented here will only perceive a strongly shortened period , i.e. the observed period @xmath41 is related to the intrinsic period @xmath42 by ( cf . also camenzind & krockenberger  1992 , roland et al .",
    "1994 ) @xmath43 performing the integration , one immediately arrives at @xmath44 from the theoretical point of view , relativistic blazar jets are thought to be oriented at a small viewing angle .",
    "current emission models favour an inclination angle @xmath45 ( spada  1999 ; cf .",

    "recently , villata & raiteri  ( 1999 ) have argued that bl lacs represent advanced and close bbhs with a decreased mass accretion rate , the binary separation in the case of mkn  501 being of the order of that for which gravitational radiation becomes dominant .",
    "thus , we might set an upper limit on the allowed binary masses in mkn  501 by assuming that the current separation equals the gravitational separation @xmath57 , i.e. the position where the gas dynamical time scale is balanced by the time scale for gravitational energy losses ( bbr  80 ) .",

    "the masses shown in fig .  [ mass ] are in a reasonable range for ellipticals .",
    "masses of the order of one million solar masses for the companion black hole appear to be in agreement with the concept that the galaxy swallowed in the merger process was a minor spiral galaxy . on the other hand",
    ", the host galaxy of mkn  501 seems to belong to these classes of ellipticals which have black holes in the centers of at least a few hundred million solar masses .",
    "therefore , the binary scenario for mkn  501 seems not unlikely .",

    "in this paper we have suggested that the periodicity in the flaring state observed in mkn  501 might be caused by the orbital motion of the jet in a close bbhs . applying a simple toy - model we have shown that the bbhs may have a period of @xmath76 yrs and a centre - of - mass distance of @xmath77 cm . if one assumes that this separation corresponds to the distance at which gravitational radiation becomes important , several upper limits for the binary masses",
    "may be derived .",

    "aharonian et al .",

    "thus , for the projected length at the position of mkn  501 one finds @xmath85 mas for @xmath86 rad . remarkably , the jet of mkn  501 bends dramatically at about @xmath87 mas from the core ( marscher  1999 ) .",
    "hence , a change in the jet parameters might be the reason for the termination of the observed periodicity .    for the proposed model to be valid",
    ", the jet has to be perfectly collimated with an intrinsic opening angle of less then @xmath88 .",
    "such values are indeed expected in scenarios for the formation and collimation of magnetized bl lac jets ( cf . camenzind & krockenberger  1992 ; appl & camenzind  1993 ; schramm et al .",
    "1993 ) . at first sight",
    ", such a cylindrical jet structure seems to be at least @xmath89 times more collimated than the jet seen on vlba maps ( cf .",
    "marscher  1999 )",
    ". however , there is evidence for an at least two - component jet structure in mkn  501 suggesting an inner spine with transverse magnetic field and an envelope with longitudinal magnetic field ( aaron  1999 ; marscher  1999 ) , the polarization properties of the inner spine strongly supporting shocked - jet models ( cf .",
    "attridge et al .  1999 ) .",
    "in fact , our model requires that the high energy emission originates in a channel along the jet axis as in two - fluid models ( e.g. sol et al .",
    "1989 , roland et al .",
    "1994 ) , the inner emission probably being self - absorbed on the vlba scale .",
    "recent observations of radio jets indeed indicate a confinement of the higher energy emission to a well - defined channel within a much more extended radio emission ( bahcall et al .",
    "1995 ; perlman et al .",
    "1999 ; swain et al .",
    "the unification of bl lacs and fr i objects may add another piece of evidence to such a jet configuration : in order to account for the observed spectral properties an at least two - fold jet velocity structure seems to be required in which a fast spine is surrounded by a slow ( but still relativistic ) layer ( chiaberge et al .",
    "support for such a possibility is positively provided by numerical simulations ( cf .",
    "aloy et al .",
    "2000 ; frank et al .",
    "2000 ) .    for a tev flux ratio between minimum and maximum of @xmath90 , the corresponding shift in the break frequency would be given by a factor of @xmath91 while the x - ray flux ratio becomes @xmath92 applying an hard x - ray spectral index @xmath93 ( cf . lamer & wagner  1998 ; pian et al .",
    "such values seem to be consistent with bepposax observations ( pian et al .",
    "1998 ) and may also be recovered , using a broken power law fit , in rxte observations of mkn  501 ( cf .",
    "krawczynski et al .",
    "2000 , their figs.1 and 2a ) .",
    "gamma - ray observations carried out by the cat telescope also reveal a shift of the maximum peak energy apparently in accordance with the expectation above ( djannati - atai et al .",
    "small changes in the maximum electron lorentz factor or the magnetic field along the trajectory of the emission region may further add to flux variations .",
    "if there is indeed an additional flux contribution , e.g. low energy emission from the layer , a stationary component comparable to the observed infared - optical flux ( e.g. pian et al .",
    "1998 ; cf . also kataoka et al .  1999 ) or an additional component responsible for the soft x - ray emission ( e.g. lamer & wagner  1998 ; wagner et al .  1999 ) , the amplitude of the doppler modulation may decrease to lower frequencies .    in the simple model presented above ,",
    "we have not yet considered the influence of jet precession due to gravitomagnetic and geodetic origin with a period @xmath94 ( cf .",
    "thorne et al .",
    "1986 ) . since this driving period is much larger than the orbital period ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab ] ) , a precessional modulation should be negligible during a few revolutions .",
    "interestingly , a precessional period of @xmath95 yrs agrees with the driving frequency found by conway & wrobel  ( 1995 ) in order to explain the misalignement of the radio jet in mkn  501 on parsec and kiloparsec scale ( see also villata & raiteri  1999 ) . if the binary hypothesis is correct , the observable period should remain similar during different outburst phases unless there is a change in the general jet properties .",
    "for example , an increase in the observed period should then be accompanied by a decrease in the bulk lorentz factor or , on larger time scales , by an increase of the inclination angle due to the jet precession ( cf . also eq .",

    "<S> we investigate the implications of a massive binary system in the centre of the gamma - ray blazar mkn  501 and show that the periodical behaviour recently observed in the tev and x - ray lightcurves may possibly be related to the orbital motion of the relativistic jet emerging from the less massive black hole . </S>",
    "<S> for the special relativistic jet properties inferred from emission models , we derive an intrinsic orbital period of @xmath0 yrs and a centre - of - mass distance of @xmath1 cm . </S>",
    "<S> if the binary is very close with a separation of the order of that for which gravitational radiation becomes dominant , we find a maximum primary mass of @xmath2 and a corresponding secondary mass in the range of @xmath3 depending on the intrinsic jet properties . </S>",
    "<S> such values are in line with the black hole masses expected from merger scenarios . </S>"
