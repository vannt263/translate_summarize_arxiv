    "the cardiovascular system ( cvs ) is responsible for supplying the human organs with blood .",
    "it is composed by the heart , the arteries , and the veins .",
    "the heart has as function to pump blood throughout the body , that is realised by means of contractions @xcite .",
    "the human heart beats an average @xmath0 beats per minute and pumps 0.07 liters of blood per beat @xcite .",
    "the contraction and relaxation of the heart is obtained by a single cycle of the electrocardiogram signal ( ecg ) , namely the ecg records the electrical activity of the heart .",
    "waller in 1887 @xcite measured for the first time the electrical activity from the heart , and the first practical electrocardiograph was invented by einthoven in 1901 @xcite that it was used as a tool for the diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities .    in the recent past ,",
    "several theoretical investigations pertaining to cvs have been carried out to analyse electrocardiogram signal @xcite .",
    "mathematical models have been developed to understand physiological function and disfunction in cvs .",
    "a mathematical model which have been used to generate ecg signals is the van de pol oscillator @xcite .",
    "gois and savi considered three modified van der pol oscillators connected by time delay coupling to describe heart rhythm behaviour @xcite .",
    "the coupled van der pol oscillators was also used in studies about the control of irregular behaviour in pathological heart rhythms @xcite .",
    "mcsharry and collaborators @xcite introduced a dynamical model to describe generating synthetic electrocardiogram signals .",
    "this model is based on a set of three ordinary differential equations in that it is incorporated the respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( rsa ) by means of a bimodal power spectrum consisting of the sum of two gaussian distributions .    in this work ,",
    "instead two gaussian distributions we propose an autoregressive ( ar ) process for the rsa to obtain the ecg .",
    "boardman and collaborators @xcite study autoregressive model for the heart rate variability ( hrv ) @xcite .",
    "they found the optimum order of autoregressive model which can be used for spectral analysis of short segments of tachograms .",
    "we compare the results obtained from two gaussian distributions and ar with experimental tachogram . to do that",
    ", we use as diagnostic tools the poincar plot @xcite and detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite .",
    "we have verified that the result with ar process agrees with the experimental tachogram more closely than the result with two gaussian distributions .",
    "this way , we generate the ecg by means of coupled differential equations considering the ar process to obtain the angular velocity of the tachogram .",
    "the angular velocity is an important parameter in the mathematical model for the ecg signal , and variation in the angular velocity produces variation in the times elapsed between successive heartbeats .",
    "this article is organised as follows : in section 2 we introduce the model with autoregressive process for tachograms , in section 3 we compare our results with experimental datas , and in the last section we draw our conclusions .",
    "the ecg is a noninvasive method used to measure electrical activity of the heart through electrodes placed on the surface of the skin .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the relationship between the cardiac conduction and the ecg . in the sinoatrial node ( sa ) , known as natural pacemaker ,",
    "the heartbeat starts .",
    "the atrioventricular node ( av ) is responsible for the passage of electrical signals from the atria to the ventricles . at last",
    ", the signal arrives at the purkinje fibers and makes the heart contract to pump blood , where the r - peak occurs .",
    "the time between successive r - peaks is the rr - interval and the series of rr - intervals is known as rr tachogram .",
    "macsharry and collaborators @xcite argued that the heartbeat can be described by means of three coupled ordinary differential equations with the inclusion of rsa at the high frequencies ( @xmath1 ) and mayer waves ( mw ) at the low frequencies ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the equations are given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( mod @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 , and @xmath11mv .",
    "the other parameters are given in table [ pareq ] according to reference @xcite .",
    ".parameters for equation ( [ eqgaus ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     all in all , we calculate the angular velocity from the tachogram generated by the ar process",
    ". then , we use the angular velocity in equation ( [ eqgaus ] ) to obtain the ecg signal .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the ecg signal in the time interval @xmath12s , where @xmath13 yields a synthetic ecg with a realistic pqrst morphology according to figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a mathematical model given by coupled differential equations that describes electrocardiogram signals . in the original model",
    "is considered a power spectrum with two gaussian distributions to build the tachogram . through the tachogram",
    "is obtained the angular velocity that is used in the original mode . in this work ,",
    "we propose to calculate the angular velocity by means of the ar process .",
    "we verify that the power spectrum from ar process has a good agreement with the power spectrum from experimental data .",
    "we have also compared the tachograms generated from gaussian distributions and ar process with the experimental tachogram using dfa and poincar plot . as a result , in both dfa and poincar plot , the tachogram generated considering the ar process is in closer agreement with experimental than the two gaussian . as a consequence , with the tachogram ,",
    "the angular velocity is calculated and the ecg signal can be built utilising coupled differential equations with ar process .    ) considering ar process.,width=302,height=188 ]",
