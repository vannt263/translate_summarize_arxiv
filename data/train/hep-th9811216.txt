    "random matrices are useful for a wide range of physical problems . in particular , by the means of feynman rules , random matrices can be interpreted in term of two - dimensional surfaces , which themselves are related to two - dimensional quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "2d quantum gravity models can be coupled to matter fields , with a non - zero central charge @xmath1 . in term of matrices , this leads to consider multi - matrix models , which , studied near their critical points , in the scaling limit , allow to recover a continuous theory .",
    "some of the random matrices models have been solved exactly @xcite and the continuous limit one recovers in the neighborhood of their critical points has been related to @xmath2 quantum gravity models .",
    "although the behaviour of @xmath3 models is well understood , exact methods have not been able to solve @xmath4 models yet .",
    "there is a `` @xmath5 barrier '' , which prevents us from using @xmath4 matrix models as a tool to understand @xmath4 two - dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "whereas exact technics are unable to deal with @xmath4 models , an approximate method is likely to succeed better . in 1992 ,",
    "brezin and zinn - justin @xcite introduced a new method to solve random matrices models : the large @xmath0 renormalization group ( rg ) , where the rescaling parameter @xmath0 is the size of the matrices . integrating over part of the matrices to reduce @xmath0",
    "one obtains a rg flow in the space of actions .",
    "fixed points should correspond to critical points of matrix models in the large @xmath0 limit and the scaling dimensions of operators give the corresponding critical exponents .",
    "for instance , the scaling dimension @xmath6 of the most relevant operator is related to the `` string exponent '' @xmath7 by the relation @xmath8    while the large-@xmath0 renormalization group method was introduced to study directly @xmath4 models , its application to already solved ( by exact methods ) @xmath3 models is also useful .",
    "indeed , in @xcite it was argued by one of the authors that the understanding of the behaviour of the flows for @xmath3 models would throw light on what happens at @xmath4 : taking into account `` branching interactions '' in matrix models , it is expected that in addition to the gravity fixed point there is another fixed point ( corresponding to the  branching \" transition between 2d gravity and branched polymer behavior ) . the value of the critical exponents when @xmath9 ( known from the exact solutions and kpz scaling ) support the conjecture of @xcite that at @xmath5 these two fixed points would merge , and that there would be generically no gravity fixed point for @xmath4 models .    in this paper",
    "we develop the large @xmath0 rg method in order to study precisely matrix models for 2d gravity + branched polymers .",
    "we shall describe first in sec .",
    "[ rgmm ] the renormalization group method as it was introduced by brezin and zinn - justin , and the improvements made by higuchi et al .",
    "@xcite , using the equation of motions .",
    "then we explain why these methods are not sufficient to study our class of models .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ om ] that the linear approximation of @xcite is not sufficient and we propose a method to go further , and we apply it to the one matrix model .",
    "the method still requires numerical analysis , which is performed in sec .",
    "[ na ] , where the resulting rg flow equations are analysed and the results of the method are compared to the previous results of @xcite and to the exact results . finally in sec .",
    "[ isingsection ] we shall consider the generalizations of our method , in particular to the ising plus branched polymer two - matrix model .",
    "we shall consider a matrix model for gravity plus branched polymers . the partition function is @xmath10 where @xmath11 \\label{vandtn}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ vandtn ] ) @xmath12 is the gravity coupling constant and @xmath13 is the branched polymer coupling constant .",
    "this model can be solved exactly , thus it should be a good test of renormalization group methods .",
    "when @xmath13 is equal to zero , it is the pure gravity model that was considered by brezin and zinn - justin in @xcite when they first tested their renormalization group ( rg ) method .",
    "the general idea of rg is to start from the potential @xmath14 for a @xmath15 matrix @xmath16 with @xmath17 , and to integrate over the last row and the last column of the matrix , leading to an effective action @xmath18 for the @xmath19 remaining matrix @xmath20 . performing a linear rescaling of @xmath20 ( wave - function renormalization ) to keep the @xmath21 term unchanged one obtains the renormalized action @xmath22 and the rg flow equation in the space of action @xmath23 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that at order @xmath24 the action ( [ vandtn ] ) ( with @xmath25 ) stayed closed ( up to a additive shift coresponding to a @xmath26 operator ) , i.e. no new operators were generated by the rg .",
    "the corresponding beta - function for @xmath12 was found to have a zero for @xmath27 , corresponding to the critical coupling where pure gravity scaling is recovered .",
    "however at that order the first numerical result of @xcite were only very qualitative , since the error on the critical coupling itself is of order 100% .",
    "this method was then developped further by several authors @xcite .    shortly after ,",
    "higuchi , itoi , nishigaki and sakai @xcite improved the rg method by using the equations of motion of the matrix model ( the so - called loop equations ) to eliminate some of the new operators which appear in the rg transformation at higher orders in @xmath12 .",
    "they first considered the pure gravity model with cubic action @xmath28 and showed that in the planar limit , the rg equation for the free energy @xmath29 can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a non - linear function of @xmath12 , the gravity coupling constant , and of @xmath32 .",
    "this is a non linear differential equation , at variance with the standard rg equations which should be linear and of the generic form given in @xcite @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are regular functions in @xmath12 ) . in order to obtain a standard renormalization group equation the authors of @xcite truncated @xmath36 to the first order in @xmath37 . for this problem",
    "this approximation is in fact quite good .",
    "the results they obtained for the cubic action ( [ iguchiv ] ) are : a @xmath38 error for the value of the critical coupling and a @xmath39 error for the eigenvalue corresponding to the string critical exponent @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , they have generalized this method to a one - matrix model with two couplings : @xmath41 and also to the ising two - matrix model , with in both cases results quite close to the exact results .",
    "in particular for the quartic action ( @xmath42 ) the relative errors on the coupling and the eigenvalue are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    nevertheless , the linear approximation method has only been applied up to now to gravity models without branching interactions .",
    "the case of gravity plus branched polymers , which are the models one has to consider if one wants to verify the scenario of @xcite , would be more difficult to treat .",
    "one would have to introduce @xmath45 , partial derivative of @xmath46 with respect to @xmath13 , and linearly develop the equations in @xmath45 and @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , the success of the linear approximation method of @xcite may be attributed to the fact that the value of the critical coupling for pure gravity , @xmath48 , is in fact quite small , since the corrections to the linear approximation turn out to be of order @xmath24 , and are therefore small .",
    "for branching interactions , we expect that this will not be the case . already for the pure branched polymer model ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) the critical point",
    "is @xmath51 , thus we can guess that the estimates for the general critical points would be far less precise than those for the pure gravity critical point .",
    "since in this paper we shall also use the equations of motion to write rg equations for matrix models with branching interactions , let us briefly recall the general idea . if one starts from a simple action @xmath52 such as ( [ vandtn ] ) ( which depends only on the two operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) one obtains a variation @xmath55 which is a function of all the @xmath56 for any @xmath57 . to take all these terms into account , one can try to write the action of the renormalization group on the most general partition function .",
    "this leads to expressions with an infinite number of terms which must be truncated in some way .",
    "however we know no general and natural truncation scheme , and the simplest truncations lead to a very slow convergence for the value of critical points , while the estimates for the critical exponents do not converge at all !",
    "this can be shown explicitely on the simple example of the pure branched polymer model with action @xmath58 ( which is in fact a vector model ) as discussed in appendix a.    nevertheless one must realize that all the operators are not independent .",
    "one is free ( in perturbation theory ) to include in the rg transformation a non - linear reparametrization of the field variable ( i.e. the matrix @xmath20 ) in the partition function , of the form @xmath59\\phi^k \\label{}\\ ] ] this induces an additional variation in the effective action of the form @xmath60 this variation does not change the physical content of the rg equations , since @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the `` vacuum expectation value '' ( v.e.v . ) @xmath63 ; these are the quantum equations of motion of the model , which express the relations between the v.e.v .",
    "of the traces .",
    "this ( unphysical ) arbitrariness in the rg equations is known as the problem of the `` redundant operators''@xcite .",
    "the idea is that one should use the equation of motion to simplify the expression of the rg equations and to reduce the number of operators and of coupling constants involved in the rg flows .",
    "this is what has been done in @xcite to reduce the rg equation to the form of eq .",
    "( [ linearapprox ] ) . in appendix [ vectorappendix ]",
    "we show how the method applies to the simple branched polymer model .",
    "we are now going to introduce our method , which aims at calculating the renormalization flows of gravity plus branched polymer models .",
    "we are now going to explain our method on the example of the one matrix model : @xmath64 ( more general cases as the ising plus branched polymer model will be considered in section [ isingsection ] and we shall discuss then the generalization of our method ) . as the use of the equations of motion does not allow us to put the renormalized action exactly in the same form as the action we would like to study , we are going to consider a slightly more general model : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is of the form : @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we are going to show that when the renormalization group acts on this model , the renormalized action can be put in the same form , with a renormalized @xmath66 and a renormalized @xmath12 , and @xmath70 always equal to one .    in the following",

    "we would like to keep @xmath70 equal to one .",
    "this is possible if one substracts the coefficient of @xmath53 , multiplicated by the expression appearing in the first equation of motion : @xmath117 .",
    "then we finally obtain a renormalized action exactly in the same form as the original action .    beyond this point",
    ", we shall suppress , for simplicity reasons , the @xmath91 in all our expressions .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ equafin ] ) means that , if we replace @xmath118 in @xmath119 by the right - hand part of our equation , the result will be the same .",
    "we now have obtained a renormalization group equation containing only linear terms in @xmath54 and powers of @xmath53 .",
    "so , starting from the action @xmath120 ( with @xmath121 ) , we can write ( at least in principle ) the equations for @xmath122 and @xmath123 : we just have to expand the above expression in powers of @xmath53 .",
    "this method , however , leads to very complicated expressions with many non - trivial integrals depending on the parameter @xmath12 . to be able to treat our expression easily ,",

    "the last integral in eq .",

    "in fact , the integral can be expressed as an expansion in @xmath128 and @xmath129 . what one has to do to expand the last integral properly is to treat separately the integral between @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and between @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "let us briefly describe these operations : the last integral can be expressed as a sum of two integrals : @xmath133 the first one given by @xmath134 @xmath135 and the second one given by @xmath136 @xmath137 before expanding the integrand in powers of @xmath124 , up to the order @xmath138 , we have to notice that , when @xmath124 tends to zero , the bounds of integration in @xmath139 and @xmath140 tend respectively to @xmath141 and @xmath130 .",
    "let us take @xmath140 as an example .",
    "for @xmath142 large , the terms in the expansion of the integrand are of the form @xmath143 .",
    "this implies that the integration leads to a term of order @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the terms in the expression are really of increasing powers of @xmath124 , which justifies our expansion , keeping in mind that expanding the integrand up to order @xmath144 amounts to expand the integral up to order @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , when expanding the integrand @xmath145 , we obtain expressions of the form : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a polynomial .",
    "the primitives of such terms lead to logarithmic expressions , and we finally obtain a @xmath128 and @xmath129 expansion , that is to say , in term of the coupling @xmath12 , we have an expansion in @xmath148 _ and _ @xmath149",
    ". we would not have realized the existence of these logarithmic terms if we had used a finite number of equations of motion ; they appear here because , by the use of the @xmath105 function , we have used an infinite number of equations of motion , and expanded _",
    "properly _ only after .",
    "this phenomenon should not come as a surprise , it was already observed in @xcite .",
    "once the expansion in @xmath12 has been done , we expand @xmath71 in powers of @xmath53 and , finally , we obtain a quite simple expression with two orders of expansion : @xmath150 in @xmath12 and @xmath151 in @xmath53 .",
    "after development in @xmath124 at order @xmath152 in @xmath124 , for example , the expression of the integral @xmath153 is : @xmath154    inserting the expansion for @xmath155 in eq .",

    "we show the results obtained at orders @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the axes represented correspond to the two couplings that interest us : the gravity coupling @xmath12 and the branched polymer coupling @xmath160 .",

    "( [ vandtn ] ) .",
    "it is easy to find the critical line in the ( @xmath165 ) plane : it separates the domain where one flows towards the gaussian fixed point ( @xmath166 ) from the domain where @xmath12 and @xmath13 diverge .",
    "we have chosen here to show only the flows for @xmath167 near the critical line , on both sides of it .",
    "since under the rg flows the @xmath156 s becomes non - zero , and since we project the flows on the @xmath167 plane the flows may seem to cross , of course this is unphysical and a projection of what happens in higher dimension .",
    "first one recovers the correct phase diagram and critical line ( with an average @xmath44 relative error at this order ) .",
    "the critical line is separated into two parts by a multicritical point @xmath168 .",
    "starting from the rightmost part of the critical line the flows are driven towards a fixed point * b * which lies on the @xmath49 plane .",
    "starting from the leftmost part of the critical line the flows are driven towards a fixed point * a * ( with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 @xmath171 ) .",

    "starting from the point * c * one flows towards a fixed point * c * ( also with with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 @xmath171 ) with two unstable directions , which should therefore correspond to the  branching transition \" between pure gravity and branched polymer scaling behaviour .",
    "these features of the rg flows are in full agreement with the picture which was proposed in @xcite .",
    "this agreement is confirmed by studying more precisely the numerical results .",
    "we note immediately that we recover the good critical line ( with @xmath172 error at this order ) , the bicritical point c ( which is a totally repulsive fixed point of the renormalization group ) .",

    "a solution is to study a symmetric problem : the closed chain , for example ( we do not know its exact solution ) , or the @xmath234-matrices potts model , where all matrices are coupled .",
    "the study of the latter model could be indeed very interesting : when @xmath240 , then @xmath241 and we would thus enter the @xmath242 domain .",
    "in this paper we have developped the large @xmath0 renormalisation group method to study matrix models containing interaction terms corresponding to branched polymer interactions .",
    "we have shown the analytical basis and the successes of our method .",
    "it can deal with models containing branched polymers , it gives us the shape of the flows , and also good approximations of the position of the critical points and critical exponents of the models .",
    "we have applied our method to the case of the pure gravity plus branched polymer one - matrix model , and to the case of the ising two - matrix model .",
    "our method is an approximation method : the exact expressions must be truncated to a certain order to be numerically manageable ( the ideal case of the infinite chain being the exact solution ) .",
    "however , the extrapolation of the first orders gives good results without taking high computation times .",
    "but , when studying models with a growing complexity ( @xmath234-matrices open chains ) , we may reach for big @xmath234 the practical limits of the method , and thus it would be a good thing to find more technical simplifications .",
    "we also plan to study @xmath234-matrices potts models , which are very symmetric models ( so technically simpler ) but which would allow to cross the @xmath4 barrier for @xmath243 , and are thus theoretically more complex models .",

    "the large @xmath0 rg method has already been applied to the ( very ) simple case of the vector model in @xcite .",
    "this model corresponds to the limit @xmath49 of the matrix model with action ( [ vt4 ] ) , since then the u(@xmath0 ) matrix model becomes a o(@xmath244 ) vector model ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite found that if one does not use the equations of motion ( i.e. if no non - linear reparametrization of the fields is performed ) the rg flow equation seems to lead to strange results , with the apparent existence of a one - parameter family of fixed points .",
    "however they showed that when using the equations of motion one can reduce the rg flows to much simpler flows in a finite dimensional space of couplings . moreover in that case the flows can be easily calculated exactly and it is found that one recovers the exact critical points and critical exponents .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is just to present the results of a simple exercise : how do the results of the rg method change if one does not use the equations of motion , or if one uses the equations of motion in a approximate way ?",
    "we start from the action ( [ vt4 ] ) with @xmath49 for a @xmath19 hermitean matrix @xmath245 since we can rewrite @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the @xmath244-dimensional real vector whose components are the real and imaginary part of the matrix elements @xmath248 of @xmath20 , the model reduces to the vector model studied in @xcite .",
    "the rg flow equation for the potential @xmath66 can be written exactly , either by integrating explicitely over some components of @xmath247 , or by computing exactly the effective potential at large @xmath0 and studying its variation with @xmath0 .",

    "if we start at @xmath255 from the initial potential @xmath256 , i.e. from the initial function @xmath257 with @xmath258 we get at @xmath259 @xmath260 and inverting again @xmath253 we obtain the renormalized derivative of the potential @xmath261 . performing a linear rescaling @xmath262 to keep the coefficient @xmath70 of the @xmath53 term fixed amounts to changing @xmath263 in eq .",
    "( [ vxflot ] ) , with @xmath264 a linear rescaling factor fine tuned such that the constraint @xmath265 ( i.e. @xmath266 ) is kept for @xmath267 .",
    "first let us study the exact flows if one starts from the quartic potential @xmath268 , i.e. from the initial function @xmath269 .",
    "for @xmath270 small , the function @xmath71 remains analytic around the origin , but it develops a square root singularity at a finite @xmath271 , which starts for @xmath272 at the zero @xmath273 of @xmath274 , i.e. at the critical point of @xmath256 .",

[ coloredflows ] )    * if @xmath275 , the singularity @xmath276 goes to infinity as @xmath277 and the function @xmath278 tends towards the constant function @xmath279 , which corresponds to the gaussian potential @xmath280 ( gaussian fixed point ) ( fig .",

    "finite _ rg time @xmath287 , the potential @xmath66 becomes singular at the origin and the rg flow thus diverges in a finite time and reaches no fixed point ( fig .  [ coloredflows].c ) .",
    "this analysis can be extended to general initial potentials .",
    "we thus recover ( without using the equations of motion ) a sensible picture of the rg flows : the attraction domain of the gaussian fixed point , ( @xmath288 ) is separated from the domain where rg flows diverge by a critical ( unstable ) manifold where one is driven towards the non - trivial fixed point @xmath289 ( which corresponds to branched polymers ) .",
    "the only subtle point is that the non trivial fixed point is non - analytic and can not be distinguished by a local analysis around the origin ( @xmath290 ) from the gaussian fixed point .",
    "this explains the apparent paradoxes of @xcite .",
    "let us mention that if instead of using the potential @xmath291 one uses the inverse function @xmath292 , the rg flot is very simple : @xmath293 .",
    "the structure of the flow is described by the expansion of the function @xmath294 around the largest zero @xmath289 such that @xmath295 , and the ( only ) relevant scaling field @xmath296 corresponds to the first derivative @xmath297 of @xmath151 ( since the critical manifold corresponds to @xmath298 ) .",
    "this @xmath296 scales with @xmath299 as @xmath300 , therefore has scaling dimension @xmath236 .",
    "however the mapping @xmath301 is highly non - linear , and becomes singular along the critical manifold @xmath298 .",
    "therefore this does not contradict the fact that the real scaling dimension of the relevant operator is @xmath302 .",

    "one sees that as @xmath306 increase the approximated fixed points converge towards the exact ( but singular ) fixed point .",
    "however a more precise analysis ( that we do not reproduce here ) shows that the convergence is very slow , typically as @xmath312 .",
    "the finite @xmath306 estimates for the critical coupling @xmath187 ( if all higher order couplings @xmath156 , @xmath163 are set to zero ) converge towards the exact value @xmath313 at the same rate .",
    "this very slow convergence is insufficient to obtain good estimates for the critical exponents .",
    "it turns out that within this approximation scheme , the scaling dimension @xmath314 of the scaling fields at the approximate fixed point are independent of the trucation order @xmath306 !",
    "indeed they are found to be integers @xmath315 .",
    "the @xmath316 dimension should correspond to the dimension @xmath6 of the relevant perturbation , which is known to be @xmath302 .",
    "thus , although the estimates for the critical points converge towards the correct result as @xmath317 , the estimates for the scaling exponents do not ! a procedure to accelerate the convergence is required .",
