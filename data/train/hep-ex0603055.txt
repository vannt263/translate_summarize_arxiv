    "the top quark is the heaviest fundamental particle of the standard model ( sm ) : about 35 times larger than the next heaviest quark ( @xmath8 ) in the theory .",
    "a precise measurement of its mass ( @xmath9 ) is important for sm s prediction power , because top quark loops affect many electro weak ( ew ) observables .",
    "the top mass is also linked with the mass of the @xmath6 and the higgs bosons via radiative corrections ; a fact exploited by ew fits which use measured observables to simultaneously constrain the three masses assuming the standard model@xcite . since the higgs eludes experimental observation , a precise measurement of the top quark and the @xmath6 masses serve as a constraint to the higgs mass .",
    "top quarks were first observed by the cdf and d collaborations in 1995@xcite , in events produced at @xmath3 collisions of @xmath10  tev during the `` run i '' operation of the fermilab tevatron collider . the two experiments combined top mass measurements to find @xmath11 gev / c@xmath5@xcite . in the current mode of operations ( `` run ii '' ) the tevatron provides @xmath3 collisions of @xmath12  tev . at the time of this conference , it has delivered 1.3 fb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity , with about 1 fb@xmath2 recorded by each experiment ( almost ten times the run i data sample ) .",
    "the tevatron plans to deliver 4 to 8 fb@xmath2 per experiment , which aim to measure the top mass with an accuracy of @xmath13 gev / c@xmath5 each .",
    "we present here four recent @xmath9 measurements at cdf , obtained with datasets of 320 to 360 pb@xmath2 .",
    "more emphasis is given on a novel method to attack the dominant systematic uncertainty of the measurement@xcite .",
    "top quarks are mostly pair produced at the tevatron , via @xmath14 annihilation ( @xmath15 ) or gluon - gluon fusion , and they decay @xmath16 of the time to @xmath17 , with the @xmath8 quark hadronizing into a jet ( @xmath18 ) of particles .",
    "subsequently , @xmath6 s decay to quarks ( @xmath19 ) or to a lepton - neutrino ( @xmath20 ) pair and their decay mode sets the characteristics of the @xmath0 event .",
    "the most precise measurements are obtained in i ) the _ lepton plus jets _ channel ( `` @xmath21 '' ) , where @xmath22 ( 30% of @xmath0 decays , when @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) , or ii ) the _ dilepton _ channel , where @xmath25 ( 5% of the time , when @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) .",
    "we select events containing a well identified and isolated electron or muon , large missing transverse energy from the neutrino(s ) produced in the @xmath6 decay(s ) , and jets with a multiplicity depending on the decay channel .",
    "all reconstructed objects are required to have high transverse energy ( e.g. , @xmath26 gev)@xcite . in the dilepton channel , a second lepton",
    "is also requested ; most commonly an @xmath27 or @xmath24 candidate again , but sometimes we just ask for a well isolated and energetic track in order to recover some of the @xmath28 decays ( `` lepton plus track '' selection)@xcite .",
    "dilepton and @xmath21 samples are constructed to be mutually exclusive .      to reduce the combinatorial and physics background in the @xmath21 channel",
    ", it is common to request at least one @xmath8-tagged jet , i.e. , a jet identified as originating from a @xmath8 quark , typically via the presence of a secondary vertex .",
    "thus , if at least one jet is @xmath8-tagged , the possible jet - parton assignments are reduced from 12 to 6 , and to just two if both @xmath8 jets are tagged ( the two @xmath6 daughter jets are interchangeable in the reconstruction ) .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainty in the @xmath9 measurement is due to the uncertainty on the jet energy scale ( jes , i.e. , the jet - to - parton energy translation ) .",
    "the original parton energy is estimated by correcting the jet for instrumental , radiation and fragmentation effects , with a @xmath29 uncertainty for high energy jets @xcite .",
    "the novel top mass measurement we report here , uses the hadronic @xmath6 decays in the @xmath0 data sample itself to further constrain the jes .",
    "even though statistically limited , the dilepton channel has a higher signal to background ratio due to the second lepton .",
    "no @xmath8 tagging is then required .",
    "the two highest energy jets are assumed to be @xmath8 jets and we are left with just two possible jet - parton assignments . nevertheless , the measured missing energy is due to two neutrinos and",
    "we are faced with an under - constrained problem .",
    "we thus iterate over more assumptions about the event topology compared to the over - constrained case of the lepton plus jets channel .",
    "this complication results in a larger statistical uncertainty in this channel , but the smaller number of jets yields a smaller jes contribution to the systematic uncertainty .      in template methods , we impose kinematic constraints on the event according to the @xmath0 decay hypothesis and for each possible topological configuration we compute an event @xmath30 which takes into account the detector resolution and the @xmath6 and top decay widths .",
    "we get the most probable reconstructed top mass per event and we compare the distribution with similarly obtained `` template '' p.d.fs from simulated background and signal events with known @xmath9 .",
    "a likelihood minimization yields the @xmath9 which best describes the measured distribution as an admixture of @xmath0 and background events .    in matrix - element methods",
    ", for each @xmath0 candidate event we calculate a likelihood , as a function of @xmath9 , which is the differential probability that the measured quantities ( 4-momenta of reconstructed objects ) correspond to a @xmath0 signal event .",
    "the likelihood is the convolution of the leading - order ( lo ) @xmath0 matrix element and detector resolution functions , integrated over all possible configurations .",
    "similarly , we can also compute a likelihood for each event being background ( e.g. , @xmath6 plus jets in the @xmath21 case , or drell - yan for dilepton ) and sum the likelihoods according to the relative abundance of each contribution .",
    "the product of the individual event likelihoods forms the joint likelihood of the data sample , which is fitted to yield the top mass measured from the sample .",
    "the most precise measurement is obtained with a 2-dimensional template analysis of 318 pb@xmath2 of @xmath21 data@xcite .",
    "this analysis uses the dijet mass from the in - situ @xmath31 decays to constrain the jet energy scale .",
    "since the dijet mass is largely insensitive to the true top mass , we create separate templates of the reconstructed top and @xmath6 masses in simulated events as a function of the true top mass and jes , respectively , and compare them with the data distributions .    in order to improve the statistical power of the method ,",
    "four mutually exclusive subsamples are used , defined by the number of @xmath8-tagged jets and the jet @xmath32 cuts .",
    "sample `` 1-tag(t ) '' has one @xmath8-tag and @xmath26 gev for all jets , whereas `` 1-tag(l ) '' relaxes one jet s requirements to @xmath33 gev . in each subsample",
    "we select the most `` reasonable '' @xmath0 candidates by applying a cut on the @xmath30 mentioned in section [ sec : mtop_methods ] .",
    "figure 1 shows the reconstructed top mass in the data , with the best fits from the simulated templates overlaid .",
    "similar plots are obtained for the dijet mass .    a two - dimensional likelihood fit yields both the measured top mass and the jes shift ( in @xmath34 s ) from the a - priori estimate via independent means@xcite .",
    "we get @xmath35 ( stat . ) gev / c@xmath5 , were the uncertainty is statistical and incorporates the jes contribution ( @xmath36 gev / c@xmath5 , to be compared to a @xmath37 gev / c@xmath5 contribution in the 1-d template method , where the hadronic @xmath6 decays are not used to constrain the jes ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainties not included in the jes are small ( @xmath38 gev / c@xmath5 ) , resulting in @xmath39 gev / c@xmath5 .",
    "matrix - element methods are used on both the @xmath21 and the dilepton channels , and are proved to be very powerful statistically .",
    "we select events with exactly four or exactly two energetic jets for the @xmath21 and the dilepton channels , respectively ; this way , nlo effects are minimized when comparing the data with the lo matrix element for the @xmath0 production and decay . with  63  @xmath21 events containing at least one @xmath8-tagged jet each , a matrix - element analysis measures @xmath40 ( stat . )",

    "the jet energy scale is the biggest contributor to the @xmath9 systematic uncertainty : @xmath36 gev / c@xmath5 with the 320 pb@xmath2 data sample of this measurement , but it s expected to contribute @xmath54 ( 1 ) gev / c@xmath5 when 2 ( 4 ) fb@xmath2 are collected and analyzed .    by using exclusive datasets and combining the best measurement from each channel , a preliminary tevatron average ( @xmath55 gev / c@xmath5 ) was obtained in the summer of 2005 @xcite .",
