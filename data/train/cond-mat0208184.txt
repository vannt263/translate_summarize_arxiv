    "there has been considerable interest in the fractal nature of atomic distributions within amorphous condensed matter@xcite and in particular soft condensed matter such as proteins@xcite .",
    "fractal sets have been studied experimentally using x - ray and small angle neutron scattering techniques which probe the correlations between different atoms within the target .",
    "geometrical based numerical calculations @xcite have been used to determine the fractal dimension of secondary and tertiary structures of 90 proteins . for azurin ,",
    "the secondary structure of @xmath1-sheets and reverse - turns had the computed fractal dimension @xmath2 .",
    "the tertiary structure of global folding had the computed fractal dimension @xmath3 . in the above cases ,",
    "coherence lengths @xmath4 of the order of the secondary ( @xmath5 ) and the tertiary structure ( @xmath6 ) were of interest .",
    "rarely can the motion of an atom within biological macromolecules be described as a simple one - dimensional path .",
    "the soft condensed matter of biological organisms exhibits atomic motions whose properties depend strongly on temperature@xcite and hydration conditions@xcite . living organisms themselves are active only within a quite limited range of temperatures and under particular environmental conditions .",
    "for very low and very high temperatures , respectively , the entropy of soft condensed biological matter is either too small ( almost perfect order ) or too large ( severe disorder ) to sustain normal biological functions .",
    "one characterization of the intermediate range of temperatures required for life employs the fractal dimension of the paths traversed by atoms within biological matter@xcite .",
    "it is this intermediate range of temperature that is associated with a well known@xcite and biologically relevant@xcite dynamical transition from almost harmonic oscillations to strongly anharmonic modes of motion .",
    "ordinary paths are usually thought to be one - dimensional sets .",
    "however , at very low temperatures , quantum mechanics smears out the notion of a path ; i.e. there exists quantum mechanical superposition of amplitudes of alternative paths . at sufficiently high temperatures",
    "there is superposition of einstein - brownian motion probabilities@xcite .",
    "a normal path described by a velocity @xmath7 with physical units of @xmath8 $ ] is one - dimensional .",
    "a brownian motion `` path '' described by a diffusion coefficient @xmath9 with physical units of @xmath10 $ ] or area per unit time is in reality two - dimensional@xcite . in the intermediate temperature range of living organisms , biomedical proton spin nuclear magnetic imaging methods exhibit an apparent diffusion coefficient ( adc ) varying in time indicating fractal dimensional diffusion paths for the measured protons@xcite .",
    "the fractal path dynamics of atoms will be manifest in the fractal dimensions of the spatial sets on which the atoms reside . in the intermediate temperature regime and only under environmental conditions which sustain active biological functions , the fractal dimension of these spatial sets is an open question@xcite .    our purpose is to present data from elastic neutron scattering off protons ( hydrogen atomic nuclei ) within the azurin protein macromolecule . to our knowledge no high momentum - exchange incoherent neutron investigations have been employed to discuss the fractal nature of the proton distributions in proteins .",
    "the length scales here are truly microscopic ( of order @xmath11 ) .",
    "most importantly , none of the previous studies involves a discussion of the temperature dependence of the fractal exponents of the proton distributions in the dynamical - transition region . in our experiments ,",
    "when temperature was raised from low to intermediate values , the previously known dynamical transition@xcite was verified for the azurin protein only under hydrated conditions .",
    "the resulting data substantiates that hydrogen atomic protons reside on fractal geometrical sets of dimension @xmath12 but only in the intermediate biologically relevant temperature regimes and only in the presence of an amount of water required for biological activity .    in sec.2",
    ", it is shown how the sets on which atoms reside may be deduced from neutron scattering data .",
    "the physical pictures which appear from such neutron data are compared with those which have been typically obtained from x - ray scattering . in sec.3 , the mathematical expression for @xmath9-dimensional fractal form factors",
    "is derived .",
    "the more conventional debye waller expression is shown to be a special limiting case of a fractal form factor . in sec.4 ,",
    "the experimental methods for measuring the neutron elastic scattering cross section are discussed in some detail .",
    "the data is presented in sec.5 . in the concluding sec.6 ,",
    "the relationships between fractal dimensionality and biological functions are qualitatively discussed .",
    "in order to detect the geometrical sets in space within which atoms reside , it is useful to generate pictures of how the azurin macromolecule appears to a given experimental probe .",
    "the measured fractal dimensionality of sets depends on the nature of the probe , the target and the length scale being investigated@xcite .",
    "two commonly used experimental diffraction probes for taking pictures of proteins are x - ray photons and thermal neutrons .    the main contribution to the elastic scattering of thermal neutrons off protein targets comes from the incoherent scattering from hydrogen nuclei@xcite . the elastic differential cross section for the neutron to scatter from @xmath13 hydrogen atom protons within the protein macromolecule is then given by@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the single proton incoherent neutron cross section and @xmath16 is the proton form factor corresponding to a neutron momentum transfer of @xmath17 . in detail , if @xmath18 denotes the probability of finding a proton ( within an hydrogen atom ) at position @xmath19 , then the form factor @xmath20 is defined as the fourier transform @xmath21 previous studies of fractal sets in proteins@xcite relied mainly on protein structure so obtained by x - ray scattering data .",
    "the cross section for such scattering with a photon wave vector transfer of @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 and the x - ray form factor is given by the fourier transform of the density of electrons @xmath24 ; i.e. @xmath25 the neutron scattering form factor in eq.([f_of_q ] ) probes the probability distribution in space @xmath26 of the protons while the x - ray scattering form factor probes the total mean electronic density @xmath27 of all the atoms and the correlations @xmath28 between them ; i.e. @xmath29    the constituents of the azurin protein as seen by x - ray photons are shown in fig.[fig1 ] using experimental results stored in the protein data bank at brookhaven national laboratory@xcite .",
    "the electronic densities of each atom are probed by x - ray diffraction . the expected picture of non - exchangeable hydrogen atom proton positions ( deduced employing chemical structures from the same x - ray data ) are also shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the non - exchangeable hydrogen atom nuclei dominate the picture of the azurin macromolecule as probed by neutron diffraction on atomic length scales . the electron density within an atom",
    "is represented in the picture by the empirical atomic radii@xcite .",
    "the proton distributions are more localized than are the electron clouds about the nuclei .",
    "the usual ( isotropic ) debye - waller form factor@xcite @xmath30 corresponds to a gaussian probability density @xmath31 such conventional form factors for hydrogen atom nuclei assume harmonic oscillations in the position and are thereby valid only in the low temperature regime . for proteins at intermediate or high temperatures , one must take superpositions of gaussian superpositions which may be employed to describe fractal form factors . how this comes about",
    "will now be discussed .    if the position of a hydrogen atom nucleus ( as a random variable ) is distributed isotropically in space , then the probability for such a proton to be found within a sphere of radius @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 the form factor in eq.([f_of_q ] )",
    "may then be written @xmath34 a probability distribution @xmath35 will be said to exhibit a fractal dimension @xmath9 if and only if @xmath36 or equivalently if and only if @xmath37 in practise , this implies the existence of a `` coherence length '' @xmath38 such that eq.([3frac3 ] ) holds true in the regime @xmath39 while eq.([3frac4 ] ) holds true in the regime @xmath40 .",
    "a simple form factor@xcite incorporating both the notions of a fractal dimensionality @xmath9 and a coherence length @xmath4 may be written as @xmath41 for all ( isotropic ) form factor models , the mean square displacement may be computed from@xcite @xmath42 for form factor of eq.([3frac5 ] ) , the coherence length @xmath38 is related to the mean square displacement @xmath43 via @xmath44    the fractal form factor of eq.([3frac5 ] ) may alternatively be viewed as arising from an inhomogeneously distributed ensemble of protons each with gaussian distributions of varying widths .",
    "the mathematical proof of this interpretation will now be exhibited .",
    "the gamma function for @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 change variables in the above integral using @xmath47 to obtain the identity @xmath48 eqs.([3frac5 ] ) and ( [ 3frac7 ] ) for @xmath49 and @xmath50 yield the form factor @xmath51    let us now consider the density distribution due to a simple gaussian form factor @xmath52 the fractal probability density @xmath53 may be written as a superposition of gaussian densities @xmath54 in detail , eqs.([3frac8 ] ) , ( [ 3frac9 ] ) and ( [ 3frac10 ] ) imply that @xmath55    let us consider the probability @xmath56 that a hydrogen atom nucleus is at a distance @xmath57 away from an equilibrium position ; i.e. @xmath58 .",
    "the debye - waller ( gaussian ) form factor corresponds to the formally infinite value of the dimensionality @xmath59 .",
    "the fractal dimensionality associated with the secondary structure of @xmath60 sheets is @xmath61 while the dimensionality associated with the tertiary structure of global folding is @xmath62 .",
    "finally , the value of the fractal dimension ( to be discussed below ) of sets on which protons reside is @xmath63 .",
    "the plots in fig.[fig2 ] of @xmath64 are shown for the above important values of @xmath9 . as the dimensionality @xmath9 is lowered ( for _ fixed _",
    "@xmath65 ) , the distribution of particle positions are drawn inward toward the origin consistent with the definition of fractal dimensionality ; i.e. @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "the long ranged tail in @xmath68 as @xmath69 is increased as @xmath70 grows smaller .",
    "about @xmath71 of azurin powder was dehydrated under vacuum in a chamber in the presence of @xmath72 for two days .",
    "it is known@xcite for globular proteins that the ratio @xmath73 of the weight of the water to the weight of the protein in the sample in the range @xmath74 corresponds to a one - shell hydration state .",
    "a portion of azurin powder was kept dry , at an hydration level estimated as @xmath75 .",
    "another portion of powder was hydrated with heavy - water ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "a level of @xmath77 was prepared by controlled hydration in a chamber under vacuum and in the presence of a saturated kcl heavy water solution .",
    "the water content was determined by measuring the increase in weight of the protein sample . in order to achieve an almost homogeneous hydration ,",
    "the sample was arranged in the vacuum chamber to obtain the maximum exposure to the controlled environment .",
    "when the protein sample was exposed to the deuterium - hydrated environment , some of the protein protons ( hydrogen ) were exchanged with environmental deuterons .",
    "it is known@xcite that on a reasonable time - scale only a small and definite proton - deuteron exchange takes place . to avoid an excess of proton - deuteron exchange , about one day",
    "was taken to reach the desired ratio @xmath78 starting from the dry powder .",
    "after each experimental run , both the @xmath79hydrated and the dry samples were weighed again in order to verify the stability of the hydration degree throughout the experiment . in all the runs and for all the samples stability was at the level of @xmath80 .",
    "elastic neutron scattering scan were performed on the backscattering spectrometer in13 at the institute laue - langevin .",
    "an energy resolution of @xmath81 , corresponding to an incident wavelength of @xmath82   at a backscattering angle of @xmath83 , was achieved .",
    "the rather high incident energy of the thermal neutrons on in13 allows an investigation of a wide range in @xmath84 in the interval ( 0.08 @xmath85 ) .",
    "the measured quantity was the elastic part of the dynamic form factor@xcite , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the position of the @xmath88 hydrogen atom nucleus at time @xmath89 . in theory ,",
    "the dynamic structure factor obeys the decomposition@xcite @xmath90 into an elastic @xmath91 and inelastic @xmath92 part . in practise ,",
    "one finds the elastic part by integrating the measured @xmath93 over a small but finite frequency bin @xmath94 . for our case ,",
    "the bin size was @xmath95 so that @xmath96    the elastic scattering was measured for 3 hours in the temperature range @xmath97 ( i ) at 28 temperatures for @xmath98hydrated and ( ii ) at 31 different temperatures for the dry powder .",
    "in both cases , about 200 mg of sample was held in a standard flat aluminum cell with internal spacing of .5 mm placed at an angle of 135@xmath99 to the incident beam .",
    "the data were corrected to take into account the incident flux , cell scattering , self shielding and the detector response which refers to the sample at the lowest temperature ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "an average transmission probability of 0.95 was obtained .",
    "neither multiple scattering nor multi - phonon corrections were applied . in both the hydrated and the dry cases ,",
    "the scattering intensity was largely dominated by the incoherent contribution of the protein hydrogen atoms ( without proton - deuteron exchange in the hydrated sample ) .",
    "the coherent and other incoherent contributions are estimated at less than the 5% of the overall scattering probability .",
    "shown in fig.[fig3 ] are measured values of @xmath101 for the hydrated azurin powder obtained from neutron diffraction .",
    "the experimental results may be compared with ( i ) the standard debye - waller model eq.([3frac0a ] ) or ( ii ) the structure factor eq.([3frac5 ] ) of a set with fractal dimensionality @xmath9 .",
    "the dotted lines in fig.[fig3 ] represent the debye - waller form factor of eq.([3frac0a ] ) in terms of the mean square displacements .",
    "the mean square displacement was obtained from the data in accordance with eq.([msd_definition ] ) . in order to achieve an experimental definition of the mathematical @xmath102 limit we used a multiple fit procedure .",
    "we chose the lowest 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 experimental points in @xmath103 .",
    "for each temperature , the best fit was obtained as the reduced-@xmath104 weighted average of the four possibilities employing different numbers of @xmath103 values .",
    "the solid lines represent the maximum likelihood estimate of fractal dimension @xmath9 employed in eq.([3frac5 ] ) . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the description of the data in terms of the debye - waller form factor is reasonable . for dry azurin ( data not shown ) , only small deviations from the debye - waller form factor",
    "were observed . for hydrated azurin , as the temperature increases , very large deviations from the debye - waller appear in the data . in regimes",
    "wherein these large deviations were observed , a form factor of fractal dimension @xmath9 provided an accurate description of the experimental results .    in order to model the distances that the hydrogen atom protons wander from their mean equilibrium positions , we use a parametric einstein model ; i.e. the mean square displacement at temperature @xmath105 is described in terms of an effective temperature dependent hooks force constant @xmath106 where @xmath107 as the proton mass .",
    "@xmath108 if the hydrogen atom proton were attached to an equilibrium position by a simple hook s law spring @xmath109 to its equilibrium position , then a single einstein frequency@xcite @xmath110 would adequately fit the experimental data for @xmath111 . in reality , there is no single frequency @xmath110 for proton oscillations .",
    "nevertheless , one may still define an effective temperature dependent frequency @xmath112 to describe the mean strength of forces restoring the hydrogen atom to its equilibrium position . in the hydrated azurin protein samples , we find at the lowest temperatures @xmath113 while at higher temperatures the restoring forces are softer and so the frequency is lower ; i.e. @xmath114 .",
    "we have here introduced a dynamical transition temperature @xmath115 to characterize the softening of of the oscillation frequency spectrum as will now be discussed .",
    "the powder - averaged mean square displacement data from the hydrated sample are shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the data displays a marked temperature dependences not present in the dry azurin sample .",
    "the marked temperature dependence has also been observed in many other types of hydrated protein samples employing many techniques @xcite including neutron diffraction @xcite in the temperature range ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the behavior of the mean square displacements as a function of temperature is independent of secondary protein structure details , and has been characterized by a dynamical transition in temperature from a harmonic to a non - harmonic regime . in order to unambiguously determine a dynamical transition temperature @xmath117",
    ", we fit a simple single frequency einstein model to the experimental mean square displacements for @xmath118 and then we varied the range values of @xmath117 .",
    "the reduced-@xmath119 of these analyses was plotted as shown in the insert of fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the best reduced-@xmath104 agreement with experimental data is obtained for @xmath120 .",
    "the dotted curve in the main of fig.[fig4 ] shows the relative theoretical fit to the data , corresponding to a frequency of @xmath121 uniform in temperature .",
    "this curve reproduces well the experimental behavior at low temperature taking quantum effects correctly into account . above @xmath117",
    "such a simple einstein model is clearly inadequate for the present hydrated sample .",
    "we fit the data with a smooth fermi function merely to extrapolate the temperature dependent @xmath112 from the low temperature value of @xmath122 to the higher temperature value of @xmath123 . in the entire range of experimental temperatures",
    ", we have @xmath124 .",
    "the frequency @xmath125 is a smoothly decreasing function of temperature .",
    "the solid curve in fig.[fig4 ] shows the parametric einstein model fit to the experimental mean square displacement data as a function of temperature .",
    "the experimental softened frequency of the high temperature regime is given by @xmath126 .",
    "in the inset of fig.[fig5 ] , we show the experimental points for the effective frequency @xmath127 as determined by the experimental mean square displacements and eq.([einst_model ] ) .",
    "the solid curve represents the fermi function fit to the experimental @xmath127 , the width of the transition being @xmath128 .",
    "the temperature scale is in reduced units relative to the dynamical transition temperature @xmath117 .",
    "our central results concerning the fractal dimensionality of the hydrated protein are shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "the maximum likelihood values of the fractal dimension @xmath9 are plotted as function of the reduced temperature .",
    "well above the dynamic transition temperature , where the effective restoring to equilibrium forces on the hydrogen atom proton are softened , the fractal dimension of the set in which the proton resides is well defined and given by @xmath129 . as the temperature",
    "is decreased , the dimension of the set grows until ( for say @xmath130 ) the likelihood fits are so broad as to become meaningless . in the dry case",
    ", there is no likelihood convergence in any temperature regime . under hydrated conditions for @xmath131",
    ", the fractal dimension characterizes those protein samples whose parameters are neighboring the range allowing normal biological functions .",
    "some remarks on our definition of fractal dimension are in order . for the case under discussion ,",
    "the fractal dimensionality @xmath132 is derived from _",
    "incoherent _ neutron scattering from single hydrogen nuclei . for the atomic length - scale of these experiments , @xmath132 is the fractal dimension of the set on which a single proton resides .",
    "this fractal dimension @xmath132 is defined independently of the positions of the other atoms .",
    "there has been considerable previous and important work based on _ coherent _ scattering experiments measuring fractal sets of dimension @xmath133 wherein @xmath134 .",
    "coherent scattering depends on amplitude superposition interference from pairs of different atoms .",
    "the correlation dimension @xmath133 , describes sets that span a larger length scale and require the positions of atomic pairs for their definition .",
    "these larger length scales are connected with the pair - correlation properties of the @xmath135-carbons of the polypeptide chain@xcite or with length - scales typical of the secondary and tertiary structures .",
    "the density fractal dimension @xmath9 of this work describes the length scales of inter - atomic spacing while the correlation fractal dimension @xmath133 describes the length scales of the full protein size .",
    "( the length scale in diffraction experiments is @xmath136 . ) to our knowledge no relevant temperature dependence has been observed for the correlation fractal dimension @xmath133 .",
    "only the interaction with environmental conditions related to major changes ( denaturation ) in the global structure@xcite had any effect on the values of @xmath137 . in the present case ,",
    "the density fractal dimension @xmath9 is only well defined when the protein sample is at biologically relevant temperatures and in the biologically relevant hydrated condition . in regimes",
    "wherein the protein is in tact but not anywhere near the form required for normal biological life functioning , @xmath9 shows a strong divergence and becomes experimentally ill defined .    a principle biological function of azurin is electron transfer .",
    "it is known that the electron - transfer efficiency of membrane protein ensembles is strongly reduced by lowering the temperature below that of the dynamical transition@xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown @xcite that protein atomic - level dynamics can amplify the electron transfer rates via the quantum interference of amplitudes from alternative paths .",
    "the regime of normal biological functions is also the regime for exhibiting atomic length scale single particle sets of fractal dimension @xmath132 .",
    "what sense can be made of this observation ?",
    "a large organization ( protein ) functions collectively . an individual unit ( atom ) within",
    "the organization wanders to and fro .",
    "if the motions of individual units involve a dimensionally large set ( say two or three dimensions ) , then the unit moves all over a neighborhood in very many random directions and taking very many possible jumps of quite indefinite lengths .",
    "if the unit moves in fewer directions and with a smaller number of possible differing length scales , then the fractal dimension @xmath9 of the set on which the unit lives is also smaller .",
    "this occurs above the dynamical transition temperature wherein the time scale ( @xmath138 ) of the motion is increased .",
    "if each unit ( atom ) has fewer definite paths and fewer individual choices of motion , then the resulting fractal dimensional residential set is indicative of the healthy collective functioning of the larger organization ( protein ) .",
