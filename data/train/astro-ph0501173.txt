    "a current prevailing view is that large galaxies formed from the hierarchal accretion of smaller systems . in this picture , the first proto - galactic fragments were likely disks that had masses significantly smaller than the milky - way ( klypin et al . 1999 ) , and obtained angular momentum from the torquing action of nearby mass concentrations .",
    "these early disks were consumed quickly in major mergers that kinematically heated the progenitors and induced large - scale star formation .",
    "the merger activity that dominated during early epochs could have prevented the formation of stable , long - lived disks ( e.g. weil , eke , & efstathiou 1998 ) , and the epoch when stable disks appear in large numbers is of great importance for understanding the evolution of disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "efforts to measure the age of the galactic disk have yielded a range of results ( e.g. discussion in hansen 1999 ) , and so studies of other galaxies are of great interest .",
    "systems with disk - like light distributions are seen in large numbers at @xmath10 ( e.g. marleau & simard 1998 ; labbe et al .",
    "2003 ) , suggesting that they may be long - lived structures even at high redshifts . among nearby galaxies , an early epoch for the formation of stable disks is supported by the presence of metal - poor , and hence presumably old , globular clusters that appear to be associated with the thin disk of m31 ( morrison et al .",
    "the presence of such a cluster system in m31 may indicate that disks are relatively hardy entities , given the evidence for tidal interactions between m31 and its companions ( ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ) , which may have caused large - scale mixing ( brown et al . 2003 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2003 ) .    while long - lived disks may not form early - on",
    ", the extraplanar regions of spiral galaxies may contain stars with ages that span the time from the collapse of the first proto - galactic fragments to the epoch of disk formation and beyond .",
    "efforts to simulate the formation of the milky - way predict that the halo started to form during early merging events that were tied to the creation of the bulge , and preceded the formation of the disk ( e.g. nakasato & nomoto 2003 ; bekki & chiba 2001 ) . a number of processes , such as the continued accretion of protogalactic material ( bekki & chiba 2001 ) , the disruption of satellites and the heating of the disk by tidal interactions ( e.g. sellwood , nelson , & tremaine 1998 ) , as well as the ejection of gas outside of the disk plane by star forming events , which may cool so that stars can form ( e.g. savage et al .",
    "2003 ) , have the potential to add stars with a range of ages ( and metallicities ) to extraplanar environments .",
    "edge - on disk galaxies are important laboratories for investigating the evolutionary connections between halos , disks , and bulges .",
    "if halo and bulge formation are linked , then galaxies with very small bulges should have correspondingly small halos if compared with galaxies of similar size but earlier morphological type . on the other hand ,",
    "if disk and halo formation are coupled then the relative sizes of halos and bulges should not be connected .",
    "dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) investigated the integrated photometric properties of undisturbed bulgeless edge - on disks , and found that they are embedded in diffuse flattened envelopes that show remarkable galaxy - to - galaxy similarities .",
    "the isophotes tend to become less flattened with increasing distance off of the disk , and the integrated photometric properties of the envelopes are consistent with an old population having an age in the range 6  8 gyr . while there is a large range in the metallicities estimated for the envelopes ,",
    "there are roughly equal numbers of systems with positive and negative metallicity gradients off the disk , and the mean trend is for metallicity not to change with height above the disk ( e.g. figure 10 of dalcanton & bernstein 2002 ) . given ( 1 ) the flattened nature of these envelopes and ( 2 ) that the target galaxies are bulgeless , dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) associate the envelope with the disk , and argue that it is an artifact of merger activity that kinematically heated disk material .",
    "the nearby collection of galaxies in sculptor is one of the closest ensembles of galaxies outside of the local group .",
    "the galaxies that are traditionally associated with this group extend over at least 1.5 mpc along the line of sight , and may not form a gravitationally bound system ( e.g. karachentsev et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the brightest members are late - type galaxies , and so the sculptor group is an important laboratory for studying disk - dominated systems .",
    "one of the closest members of the sculptor group is ngc 55 .",
    "this galaxy is inclined at an angle near 81@xmath11 ( kiszkurno - koziej 1988 ) , and so is favourably oriented to study the extraplanar region . however , the near edge - on orientation also complicates efforts to study the morphology of ngc 55 .",
    "sandage & tammann ( 1987 ) classify ngc 55 as an sc galaxy .",
    "however , de vaucouleurs ( 1961 ) concludes that ngc 55 is structurally similar to the lmc and that the main light concentration at visible wavelengths , which is offset from the geometric center of the galaxy , is a bar seen end - on .",
    "the sbm classification assigned by de vaucouleurs ( 1961 ) is consistent with the hi properties of the galaxy , which were investigated by hummel , dettmar , & wielebinski ( 1986 ) , and who conclude that 20% of the mass is in the bar , while 80% is distributed throughout the disk .",
    "van den bergh ( 2004 , private communication ) classifies ngc 55 as a dwarf irregular , and notes that a classification as early as sc is unlikely given the absence of an obvious nucleus . for the current study",
    "it is assumed that ngc 55 is a magellanic irregular .",
    "only a handful of studies have investigated the resolved stellar content of ngc 55 . in a pioneering study graham ( 1982 ) resolved red giant branch ( rgb ) stars off of the ngc 55 disk plane , demonstrating that a rich extraplanar population is present .",
    "graham ( 1982 ) computed an upper limit of 26.4 to the distance modulus based on the peak red giant brightness .",
    "pritchet et al .",
    "( 1987 ) investigated the bright red stellar content near one end of the galaxy , and found that the luminosity function ( lf ) of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars is similar to that in other late - type galaxies .",
    "a population of c stars was identified , and pritchet et al .",
    "( 1987 ) computed a distance modulus of @xmath12 based on the mean @xmath13band magnitude of these objects .",
    "davidge ( 1998 ) used infrared images to investigate the bright red stellar content in two ngc 55 disk fields .",
    "a prominent agb sequence was detected , and the peak agb brightness was found to be consistent with an age @xmath14 gyr .",
    "a population of red supergiants ( rsgs ) with @xmath15 was also found , from which davidge ( 1998 ) computed a distance modulus of @xmath16 .",
    "there is active star formation throughout much of the disk of ngc 55 , and there are large quantities of gas off of the disk plane .",
    "ferguson , wyse , & gallagher ( 1996 ) and otte & dettmar ( 1999 ) found shell structures and chimneys that are the signatures of supernovae explosions and stellar winds . some of this gas has evidently cooled sufficiently to form stars , as tllmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find two compact hii regions that are 2  3 arcmin ( @xmath17 kpc ) off of the disk .",
    "if star formation has occured for an extended period of time in this region of ngc 55 then stars spanning a range of ages should be present in the extraplanar region .    in the current paper ,",
    "the stellar contents of the disk and extraplanar regions of ngc 55 are investigated with the goal of providing insight into the past history of the galaxy .",
    "two sets of observations are employed .",
    "one dataset , recorded with the cfhtir imager on the 3.6 meter canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , consists of broad and narrow - band near - infrared images of a @xmath18 arcmin strip that slices through the center of ngc 55 and continues into the extraplanar region .",
    "the other dataset , obtained with gmos on the 8 meter gemini south ( gs ) telescope , consists of deep @xmath19 and @xmath20 images of a @xmath21 arcmin field that samples the extraplanar region and the outskirts of the star forming disk .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "details of the observations , the data reduction procedures , and the photomeric measurements are presented in  2 .",
    "the photometric properties of stars and star clusters near the disk plane are discussed in  3 , while the photometric properties of extraplanar stars are examined in  4 .",
    "a summary and discussion of the results follows in  5 .",
    "three adjoining fields that form a north - south strip were imaged during the nights of november 21 - 23 2002 with the cfhtir camera , which was mounted at the f/8 focus of the 3.6 metre cfht .",
    "the detector in cfhtir is a @xmath22 hgcdte array .",
    "each pixel subtends 0.21 arcsec on a side , and so the detector covers a @xmath23 arcmin@xmath24 area .",
    "a section of the dss showing the area that was observed with the cfhtir is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the entire strip was imaged through @xmath25 and @xmath26 filters , with each of the three tiles being observed with a 4 point square dither pattern .",
    "additional images of the southernmost tile , which samples the star - forming disk , were also recorded through narrow - band co and @xmath27 continuum filters .",
    "the total exposure time was 12 minutes per filter , with the exception of the observations through the co filter , where the total exposure time was 24 minutes .",
    "the image quality in the processed images is fwhm = 1.0 arcsec .",
    "a series of dark frames were recorded at the end of each night .",
    "there was no measureable night - to - night variation in the dark count rate during the three night observing run , and so a master dark frame was constructed by combining darks recorded on all nights .",
    "flat - field frames were obtained at the beginning of each night .",
    "images of a dome spot were recorded with the flat - field lamps on and then off .",
    "the former frames contain information about pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations and vignetting of the optical path that is required to flat - field the data , although thermal emission from uncooled objects along the optical path is also present . however , the latter frames contain information only about thermal emission from uncooled objects , and so a calibration image containing only flat - field information can be obtained by subtracting the images with lamps ` off ' from those with lamps ` on ' .",
    "the flat field frames constructed in this manner showed no detectable night - to - night variations , and so a single master flat was created for each filter using flat - field data obtained throughout the run .",
    "photometric studies of globular clusters , which are simple stellar systems and so are ideal for measuring uncertainties in the flat - field , using cfhtir data indicate that the flat - field frames constructed in this manner track sensitivity variations across the field at roughly the 1% level .",
    "a calibration frame that monitors signatures from thermal emission was constructed by median - combining flat - fielded images of ` blank ' fields that were observed periodically throughout the run .",
    "flat - fielded images of each sky field in each filter were corrected for dc sky variations , normalized to a common integration time , and then median - combined to reject sky sources .",
    "the raw data were reduced using a standard pipeline for near - infrared imaging that corrects for additive ( dark current , dc sky level , thermal emission , and interference fringes ) and multiplicative ( pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations and vignetting of the optical path ) effects using the calibration frames described above . the basic steps in the reduction process were : ( 1 ) dark subtraction , ( 2 ) the division by flat - field frames , ( 3 ) the subtraction of the dc sky level , which was measured on a frame - by - frame basis , and ( 4 ) the subtraction of the interference fringe and thermal emission calibration frame constructed for each filter .",
    "the individual processed images for each tile were spatially registered to correct for the dither offsets and then median - combined on a filter - by - filter basis .",
    "the combined images were trimmed to the region of common overlap , and the final @xmath26 image of the southernmost tile is shown in figure 2 .",
    "broad - band @xmath19 and @xmath20 images of a field to the south of ngc 55 , the location of which is indicated in figure 1 , were recorded with the gmos imaging spectrograph on gs during the nights of october 18 and 21 , 2003 .",
    "the detector mosaic in gmos consists of three @xmath28 eev ccds , with each pixel sampling 0.072 arcsec on a side .",
    "the detector was binned @xmath29 during readout for these observations , and so the angular scale is 0.144 arcsec superpixel@xmath30 .",
    "crampton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) describe the various gmos components in detail .",
    "six 150 sec exposures , recorded with a @xmath31 point dither pattern to allow the gaps between the detector elements to be filled during processing , were obtained in each filter .",
    "a control field , located midway between ngc 55 and ngc 247 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( e2000 ) , was also observed with a total exposure time of 2700 sec per filter .",
    "this longer exposure time for the control field was needed to match observations of a field in the halo of ngc 247 , which is the subject of a separate paper ( davidge 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the image quality in the ngc 55 and control field images is roughly 0.6 arcsec fwhm .",
    "bias frames were recorded at various times throughout the two week observing run , and these were median - combined to create a master bias frame .",
    "flat - field frames were constructed from unguided images of the twilight sky .",
    "each twilight sky image was normalized to produce a mean flux level of unity , and the results were median - combined to suppress objects on the sky .",
    "the results track pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations and vignetting across the science field at better than the 1% level .",
    "finally , an @xmath20 fringe frame was constructed by median - combining individual images of the ngc 55 and control field frames .",
    "the fringes are suppressed at a level that is less than 1% of their original amplitude .",
    "interference fringes are not evident in the @xmath19 data , and so a fringe frame was not constructed for these data .",
    "the data were reduced with a standard pipeline for ccd images that parallels in many respects the procedure described previously in  2.1 and utilizes the calibration frames discussed in the previous paragraph . the steps in the ccd reduction pipeline were : ( 1 ) the subtraction of the master bias frame , ( 2 ) the division by the flat - field frame , ( 3 ) the subtraction of the dc sky level from each exposure , and ( 4 ) for the @xmath20 data , the subtraction of the fringe frame .",
    "the individual exposures for each field were spatially registered to correct for dither offsets and then median combined .",
    "the combined images were trimmed to the area of common overlap , and the final @xmath19 images are shown in figures 3 ( ngc 55 ) and 4 ( control field ) .",
    "the photometric measurements were made with the psf - fitting program allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) . tasks in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) were used to identify stars , measure preliminary brightnesses , and construct psfs .",
    "the photometric calibration of the cfhtir data was set using observations of standard stars from hawarden et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , while for the gmos data this was done using standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "the brightnesses and colors of the landolt standards were transformed into the sdss photometric system using equations from fukugita et al .",
    "based on the scatter in the standard star measurements , the photometric zeropoints have an uncertainty of a few tenths of a magnitude in @xmath25 and @xmath27 and less than 0.01 magnitudes in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "davidge ( 1998 ) discussed near - infrared photometry of a field in ngc 55 that was observed with the cirim camera on the ctio 1.5 meter telescope and that overlaps the southern end of the cfhtir strip .",
    "although there is a significant difference in angular resolution between the two datasets ( fwhm = 1.5  1.8 arcsec for the ctio data , compared with 1.0 arcsec for the cfht data ) , the photometric measurements of the stars with @xmath34 made with the two instruments are in reasonable agreement .",
    "in particular , the mean difference in @xmath27 , in the sense cfhtir ",
    "cirim , is @xmath35 , while for @xmath36 it is @xmath37 .",
    "the quoted errors are the standard deviations about the mean .",
    "crowding is more of an issue for stars in the ctio images given the poorer angular resolution , and this will bias upwards brightnesses obtained from these data , which is consistent with the sign of @xmath38 .",
    "completeness fractions and the random errors in the photometry were assessed by running artificial star experiments . based on the cmds constructed from the data and discussed in ",
    "3 and 4 , artificial stars inserted into the cfhtir data were assigned colors matching those of agb stars , while artificial stars inserted into the gmos data had colors appropriate for rgb stars .",
    "artificial stars were considered to be recovered only if they were detected in two or more filters .",
    "these experiments indicate that the 50% completeness level occurs at @xmath39 in the densely populated regions near the ngc 55 disk plane , and @xmath40 in the less crowded extraplanar regions . as for the gmos data ,",
    "the 50% completeness level occurs near @xmath41 in the extraplanar regions .",
    "if two or more stars fall within the same angular resolution element then they will appear as a single object , and the artificial star experiments can be used to assess the incidence of such blends . given the crowded nature of the ngc 55 disk almost all stars in the southernmost tile of the cfhtir dataset are likely to be blends , but most of these involve a very faint star being combined with a bright object , so that the effect on the photometric properties of the brighter object are insignificant . however , if two sources having brightnesses within a few tenths of a magnitude of each other fall in the same resolution element then they will be detected as an object that is @xmath42 mag brighter than the more luminous of the two progenitors .",
    "the artificial star experiments predict that in the disk of ngc 55 about 3% of detected objects with @xmath43 are blends of objects having comparable brightness , while by @xmath39 the blend fraction increases to 10% .",
    "these fractions drop considerably in the extraplanar regions .",
    "as for the gmos data , blending only becomes significant near the faint end , with 10% of the sources near @xmath44 being blends of objects with comparable brightness .",
    "the data discussed in this paper sample a range of environments . to facilitate the analysis and investigate the stellar contents of these environments",
    ", the galaxy was divided into the following regions : ( 1 ) the thin disk , which in turn was sub - divided into star clusters and the field , ( 2 ) the thick disk , and ( 3 ) a region that is loosely referred to as ` the halo ' .",
    "the boundaries of the various regions are marked in figure 1 , and the rationale for placing the boundaries shown in figure 1 are discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "there are two obvious star clusters in the cfhtir data and the boundaries of these , indicated in figure 2 , were set by eye .",
    "both of these clusters are sites of h@xmath45 emission in the map constructed by tllmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and so are expected to be made up of young stars .",
    "the thin disk was defined to lie within two of the stellar disk vertical scale lengths measured by kiszkurno - koziej ( 1988 ) . because ngc 55 is inclined slightly , the foreground and background portions of the disk broaden the projected width of the galaxy . assuming a disk radius of 6 kpc , estimated from the poss image , then a projected width of 2.2 arcmin on either side of the disk center line will include the thin disk regions of the near and far ends of the ngc 55 disk , and the thin disk boundaries shown in figure 1 have this width . as for the thick disk , dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 )",
    "found that this component tends to extend to at least 5 vertical disk scale lengths off of the disk plane in very late - type disk systems .",
    "after accounting for the inclination of ngc 55 in the same way as was done for the thin disk , the thick disk boundaries were defined to fall between 2.2 and 4.4 arcmin off of the disk center line .",
    "finally , the halo is defined simply as the region that falls beyond the outer boundary of the thick disk , although in  4 it is demonstrated that this region appears simply to be a low surface brightness extension of the thick disk .",
    "the stellar contents of the star clusters and thin disk field are discussed in  3 , while the thick disk and halo regions are discussed in  4 .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cmds of stars in the thin disk field are shown in the right hand panels of figures 5 and 6 .",
    "the @xmath1 cmd in figure 6 is in many respects similar to the cmds of the ngc 55 fields studied by davidge ( 1998 ) , one of which overlaps with the area observed with the cfhtir .",
    "in particular , the prominent vertical sequence in the davidge ( 1998 ) cmds have a peak @xmath46band brightness and @xmath36 color that matches the cmd in the right hand panel of figure 6 .",
    "however , the cfhtir cmd goes deeper and has less scatter than the davidge ( 1998 ) cmds , due to the larger aperture of the cfht and better image quality .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath0 cmds both broaden towards the faint end .",
    "the standard deviation along the color axis for stars with @xmath27 between 17.75 and 18.25 is @xmath47 mag in @xmath48 and @xmath49 mag in @xmath36 . for comparison ,",
    "the artificial star experiments predict that random photometric errors introduce a scatter of @xmath50 mag in @xmath48 and @xmath51 mag in @xmath36 at @xmath39 .",
    "given that the scatter in both cmds exceeds the random photometric error predictions , it thus appears that the broadening of the cmds near the faint end is due to a real spread in stellar content . later in this section",
    "it is demonstrated that this spread is due to agb stars having a range of ages .",
    "the objects along the vertical sequence in the right hand panels of figures 5 and 6 with @xmath52 are rsgs , while the sources on this sequence with @xmath53 are evolving on the agb ( see below ) . the nature of the stars in the thin disk field can be investigated further by examining their broad - band near - infrared spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "this is done in the upper panel of figure 7 , which shows the @xmath54 two - color diagram ( tcd ) of stars in the thin disk with @xmath55 .",
    "the majority of stars have seds that are suggestive of m giants , although the seds of some are consistent with k and m dwarfs , indicating that they may be foreground objects .",
    "the stars with @xmath56 tend to scatter around the lmc lpv sequence , and there are some objects with @xmath57 , which is a color range dominated by c stars in the lmc ( hughes & wood 1990 ) .",
    "the narrow - band co and k continuum observations were used to measure the co index of the brightest stars in the southernmost tile of the cfhtir strip , and the @xmath58 cmd and @xmath59 tcd of stars in the thin disk field are shown in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "the stars fall along a single sequence in the cmd , and tend to have co indices that are consistent with them being m giants , although some have co indices that are indicative of rsgs .",
    "the brightest star in the thin disk field has a co index near 0 , suggesting that it may be a foreground dwarf .",
    "the @xmath60 cmd of the thin disk is shown in the right hand panel of figure 10 .",
    "a distance modulus of @xmath61 , based on the rgb - tip brightness measured from the gmos data (  4.2 ) , has been adopted .",
    "foreground reddening is negligible towards ngc 55 ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) , and so no reddening correction was applied .",
    "also shown in figure 10 are isochrones from girardi et al .",
    "given the overall similarities between ngc 55 and the lmc , a metallicity of z = 0.008 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath62 ) , which is comparable to the peak in the metallicity distribution function of giants in the lmc ( larsen , clausen , & storm 2000 ) , might be appropriate for ngc 55 .",
    "in fact , hii regions in ngc 55 have oxygen abundances that are similar to those in the lmc , although ngc 55 may be deficient in nitrogen with respect to the lmc ( webster & smith 1983 ) .",
    "tllmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argues that the typical disk metallicity of ngc 55 is z = @xmath63 , based on the central hii region .",
    "thus , the isochrones plotted in figure 10 have z = 0.008 .    the log(t )",
    "= 8.15 isochrone is significant as it marks the onset of the agb , and this isochrone comes close to matching the color of the agb plume in ngc 55 .",
    "the predicted peak agb brightness also falls close to a discontinuity in the number counts along the vertical sequence in the cmd , although matching the agb - tip brightness is problematic , as many bright agb stars are photometric variables , with the brightest being observed near the peak of their light curves .",
    "the peak agb brightness also has a slight metallicity sensitivity , such that m@xmath64 if z = 0.008 , which is 0.1 mag brighter than the predicted peak z=0.004 brightness . in any event",
    ", it appears that a significant number of agb stars in the thin disk of ngc 55 have progenitor masses that are close to that needed for the agb to form .",
    "these are accompanied by a sizeable population of fainter agb stars with colors and brightnesses that are consistent with log(t ) @xmath65 , indicating that this portion of ngc 55 has been an area of active star formation for at least the last 1 gyr .",
    "the comparison with the isochrones in figure 10 indicate that stars with m@xmath66 are rsgs , and it is evident that the rsg sequence in the thin disk extends to m@xmath67 .",
    "this peak rsg brightness is roughly consistent with what is seen in other star - forming disk - dominated systems , although there is considerable galaxy - to - galaxy scatter .",
    "late - type galaxies with integrated brightnesses comparable to ngc 55 have peak m@xmath68 stellar brightnesses between 11 and 12 ( e.g. rozanski & rowan - robinson 1994 ) , while the brightest rsgs in the magellanic clouds have m@xmath69 and @xmath70 ( elias , frogel , & humphreys 1985 ) .    the age of the brightest rsgs can be estimated from their luminosities .",
    "the @xmath46band bolometric correction for rsgs with @xmath70 is bc@xmath71 ( elias et al .",
    "1985 ) , and so rsgs with m@xmath67 have m@xmath72 , or log(l / l@xmath73 .",
    "this corresponds to stars with progenitor masses near 25 m@xmath74 , or ages of @xmath75 myr based on the models computed by fagotto et al .",
    "the bright rsgs are thus the result of very recent star formation throughout the disk of ngc 55 .",
    "the integrated near - infrared broad - band colors of the thin disk were measured to permit comparisons with other galaxies .",
    "there are prominent dust lanes in the area separating clusters 1 and 2 , and so the integrated colors were measured in a semi - circular annulus with a width of 10 arcsec that samples the disk to the north , south , and west of cluster 1 , but avoids the region between the two clusters .",
    "caution must be exercised in making integrated photometric measurements of this nature , as the presence of a handful of very bright stars may unduly influence aperture photometry .",
    "therefore , rather than compute the mean flux in the area described above , the median flux was computed instead .",
    "the location of the thin disk field on the tcd is shown in figure 11 , along with models for simple stellar systems from leitherer et al .",
    "the location of the thin disk field on the tcd is appropriate for an intermediate - age system .",
    "this is not an unexpected result given the preponderance of agb stars in the near - infrared cmds of the thin disk field .",
    "the integrated colors of sb(s)m systems in the 2mass large galaxy atlas ( jarrett et al .",
    "2003 ) , as computed from the total brightness measurements , are also shown in figure 11 .",
    "the sb(s)m galaxies form a sequence that cuts diagnonally across figure 11 , and the ngc 55 thin disk field falls along this sequence .",
    "this comparison indicates that the sed of the thin disk field , and thus the stellar content , is consistent with what is seen in other galaxies of similar morphological type .",
    "the outer regions of the thin disk skirt the north east corner of the gmos field , and the @xmath76 cmd of this portion of the gmos dataset is shown in the left hand panel of figure 12 .",
    "the @xmath76 cmd of the corresponding region of the control field is shown in left hand panel of figure 13 .",
    "the control field contains a mixture of foreground stars and background galaxies , with the latter dominating near the bright end .",

    "thus , there is a real variation in stellar content among bright giants , and later in this section this is shown to be due to a spread in metallicity .",
    "the brightness of the rgb - tip is a standard candle , and the rgb - tip brightness was measured from the thick disk data .",
    "the number counts in the thick disk cmd drop noticeably near @xmath122 , indicating that the rgb - tip occurs close to this brightness .",
    "a better estimate of the rgb - tip brightness can be obtained from the @xmath20 lf of rgb stars in the thick disk , which is shown in figure 19 .",
    "the final lf was constructed by restricting the sample to objects with @xmath84 between 0.5 and 1.5 and then correcting for objects falling in the same color interval in the corresponding region of the control field .",
    "the conventional means of measuring the brightness of the rgb - tip is to convolve the lf with a stobel edge - detection kernel ( e.g. lee , freedman , & madore 1993 ) .",
    "however , given the significant spray of agb stars above the rgb - tip , it was decided to apply a different technique , which judges the position of the rgb - tip based on the departure from the power - law nature of the lf , as defined by rgb stars below the rgb - tip .",
    "the ngc 55 lf shown in the lower panel of figure 19 follows a power - law at the faint end .",

    "the fitted power - law is compared with the data in the lower panel of figure 19 .",
    "the lf departs significantly from the fitted relation at @xmath125 , and this is adopted as the brightness of the rgb - tip .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) calibrated the rgb - tip as a standard candle in the i filter .",
    "following davidge et al .",

    "the inferred old age for the agb stars is consistent with what was established from the cfhtir data in  4.1 .",
    "what is the uncertainty in the age estimate determined from the comparisons in figure 20 ?",
    "the age estimate is subject to uncertainties ( 1 ) in the models , ( 2 ) in the ability to locate the upper envelope of the agb population on the cmd due to photometric variability , and ( 3 ) in the assumed distance to ngc 55 .",
    "the uncertainties in the models are difficult to assess , and an error of @xmath131 mag is ( arbitrarily ) assigned to this component .",
    "the scatter in the upper envelope of the thick disk agb sequence on the cmd suggests that stellar variability may contribute a @xmath131 mag uncertainty .",
    "the errors in the distance estimates are more easily quantifiable , and are likely on the order of @xmath131 mag , which is one half of the binning interval in figure 19 .",
    "if all three components are combined in quadrature then the total uncertainty in m@xmath132 is @xmath133 mag .",

    "ngc 55 is thus 8 gyr , while an upper limit is 13 gyr .",
    "while an agb sequence is not seen above the rgb in the halo cmd , this does not mean that these stars are abscent ; rather , they may have a density that is sufficiently low to make their detection difficult .",
    "in fact , the @xmath20 lf of stars in the halo , corrected for sources in the control field , contains a modest population of stars that extend up to 0.6 mag in @xmath20 above the rgb - tip , indicating that agb stars brighter than the rgb - tip do occur in this field .",
    "based on the similar metallicities and age properties inferred from the cmds , it appears that the halo and thick disk regions as defined here are not physically distinct entities ; rather , they are part of the same structure .",
    "dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) find that the envelopes that surround their sample of undisturbed , bulgeless , edge - on disk galaxies have many properties in common .",
    "in particular , there is a distinct break between the main disk bodies and the surrounding envelopes , while the integrated colors of the thick disks indicate that the envelopes tend to have a metallicity that is comparable to the thin disk , and contain stars that formed @xmath134 gyr in the past .",
    "finally , the envelopes also tend to be homogeneous stellar systems , in the sense that there is no evidence for age or metallicity gradients at moderately large distances off of the disk plane ( e.g. figure 10 of dalcanton & bernstein 2002 ) .    while the properties of the envelope around ngc 55 are reminiscent of those in the dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) sample , few envelopes in that sample have [ fe / h ] as low as @xmath135 , and ages as old as 10 gyr .",
    "the dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) analysis relies on integrated photometric measurements , and so may be affected by the well known age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "this degeneracy works in the sense that higher metallicities may be misinterpreted as older ages , with the result that if metallicity is overestimated then ages will be underestimated .",
    "thus , if the metallicities of the envelopes in the dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) sample were fixed at lower values then older ages would be predicted .",
    "this would then give results that are consistent with the ngc 55 envelope properties established here from resolved stars .",
    "moderately deep red and near - infrared images that were obtained with the cfhtir imager on the cfht and the gmos imaging spectrograph on gs have been used to probe the stellar content of the nearby galaxy ngc 55 .",
    "the data are used to investigate the stellar content along the disk plane and in the extraplanar region using evolved red stars as probes .",
    "the results of this investigation provide insight into the past history of the galaxy .",
    "in  3.1 it was shown that the integrated near - infrared sed of the disk near the center of ngc 55 is similar to the seds of other magellanic irregular galaxies , and is consistent with significant recent star formation .",
    "in fact , the thin disk field contains a population of rsgs that have brightnesses consistent with very young ages , indicating that the region near the center of ngc 55 has been the site of large scale star formation within the past 8 myr .",
    "there are also two large clusters that have ages near 10 myr .",
    "the cfhtir data samples the disk near the main light concentration in ngc 55 .",
    "the presence of very young stars in this portion of the ngc 55 disk may not be surprising if the main light concentration is a bar viewed end - on ( de vaucouleurs 1961 ) , as the ends of bars in magellanic - type galaxies tend to be sites of very recent star formation ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1980 ) .",
    "a substrate of luminous agb stars is seen throughout the thin disk , and comparisons with models from girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicate that these objects span a range of ages .",
    "a prominent feature in the cmds constructed from both the cfhtir and gmos data is a plume that appears to contain stars with masses close to that needed to commence evolution on the agb .",
    "a plume of stars with a similar color and peak brightness is seen in the cmds of the two ngc 55 fields studied by davidge ( 1998 ) .",
    "one of the davidge ( 1998 ) fields samples a region of the ngc 55 disk that is , like",
    "the regions observed with gmos , well offset from the optical center of the galaxy .",
    "thus , the stars on the agb plume occur throughout the disk of ngc 55 .    the detection of large numbers of stars with masses near the rsg ",
    "agb evolutionary transition provides clues into the star - forming history of ngc 55 during recent epochs .",
    "one possibility is that ngc 55 is being viewed at a fortuitous time following an isolated episode of star formation when the rsg ",
    "agb transition just happens to be occuring .",
    "however , it is more likely that the detection of significant numbers of stars with masses close to those needed to evolve on the agb indicates that there has been vigorous star formation during the past 0.1  0.2 gyr .",
    "in fact , data from other sources indicate that the sfr in ngc 55 during the past 0.1 - 1 gyr has been at least as high as that at the present day , and that it is more likely that the star formation rate ( sfr ) of ngc 55 has recently dropped .",
    "a number of indicators support a present - day sfr of at most a few tenths of a m@xmath74 year@xmath30 .",
    "the fir luminosity and radio continuum emission from ngc 55 suggest that the present - day sfr is 0.3 m@xmath74 year@xmath30 ( dettmar & heithausen 1989 ) , while the integrated h@xmath45 flux of ngc 55 is consistent with a sfr of 0.16 m@xmath74 year@xmath30 ( ferguson et al .",
    "the sfr computed from x - ray flux measurements ranges between 0.06 and 0.18 m@xmath74 year@xmath30 , based on equations 14 and 15 of ranali , comastri , & setti ( 2003 ) .",
    "recent fir flux measurements from the spitzer space telescope yield a sfr of 0.22 m@xmath74 year@xmath30 ( engelbracht et al .",
    "these various estimates of the present - day sfr are significantly lower than what is computed from the blue luminosity , which is a measure of the sfr averaged over the past gyr , and which predicts a sfr of 1.6 m@xmath74 year@xmath30 in ngc 55 ( dettmar & heithausen 1989 ) .",
    "further evidence that the sfr has dropped during the past @xmath136 years comes from the high sne rate needed to explain the extended x - ray emission around the galaxy ( oshima et al .",
    "there may have been brief lulls in star - forming activity , as tllmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argue that breaks in the sfr may be needed to allow gas in the extraplanar region to cool sufficiently for stars to form , as has happened in ehr 1 and 2 .",
    "the stellar content throughout the thin disk of ngc 55 appears to be well mixed .",
    "for example , the distribution of the @xmath36 colors of stars with @xmath27 between 16.0 and 17.5 does not change with distance from the disk plane ; a gradient in the color distribution would be expected if mean age changed with height above the disk plane .",
    "the ratio of objects with seds consistent with m giants to stars with seds similar to lmc lpvs also does not change with distance above the disk plane in the thin disk region . adopting @xmath137 as the dividing line between m giants and lpvs in the tcd ,",
    "then the ratio of m giants to lpvs is 11/8 @xmath138 in the portion of the thin disk between 1.1 and 2.2 arcmin from the disk plane , compared with 162/125 @xmath139 for stars within 1.1 arcmin of the disk plane .",
    "the similarity in the stellar contents of the regions probed with the cfhtir , which samples the disk plane , and gmos , which samples the edge of the thin disk , further suggests that the disk of ngc 55 has experienced a remarkably uniform star - forming history .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that ngc 55 is viewed nearly edge - on , and so any given site line samples stars from a large range in galactocentric distances . a high inclination can thus introduce an apparent uniformity in stellar content , as the star - forming history is smoothed over large portions of the galaxy .",
    "this also makes it easier to detect rare features in cmds , such as the onset of the agb , as the projected density of objects is higher than in other orientations .",
    "we close this portion of the discussion by noting that the contribution made by c stars to the total agb luminosity peaks near log(t@xmath140 in moderately metal - poor systems ( maraston 1998 ) ; therefore , a large c star population might be expected in ngc 55 based on the star - forming history inferred from various sources , including the cfht and gmos data .",
    "however , figure 9 of pritchet et al .",
    "( 1987 ) suggests that the c star frequency in ngc 55 may be relatively low given the integrated brightness of the galaxy .",
    "it is thus worth noting that candidate c stars with @xmath55 are seen in the @xmath54 tcd of thin disk stars .",
    "these c stars may well be the tip of the iceberg , and their presence suggests that a rich c star population remains to be discovered in the disk of ngc 55 .",
    "the cfhtir and gmos data sample the extraplanar stellar content of ngc 55 , and both datasets support an old age for this region of the galaxy ; more specifically , based on the peak brightnesses of stars on the agb there is no evidence for a young or intermediate age component outside of the region that is defined here as the thin disk .",
    "this result is perhaps surprising given the presence of gas and dust outside of the disk plane ( e.g. ferguson et al .",
    "1996 ) . of course , the extraplanar region is not completely devoid of young stars , as there are some pockets of recent star formation ( tllmann et al .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that extraplanar star - forming regions like ehr 1 and ehr 2 have not contributed significantly to the stellar content of the envelope surrounding ngc 55 .",
    "the metallicities of ehr 1 and 2 suggest that they formed from material that did not originate in the thin disk ( tllmann et al .",
    "in fact , the metallicities of these hii regions are in excellent agreement with the mean metallicity among rgb stars in the extraplanar region .",
    "this suggests that the age - metallicity relation in the extraplanar region may have been flat over a large fraction of the age of the universe , after an initial period of rapid enrichment ( see below ) .",
    "this could occur if the envelope has not been the site of large scale star formation for the past 10 gyr or if it is unable to retain processed material .",
    "another possibility is that there has been infall of metal - poor material at a rate that has fortuitously maintained the mean metallicity of the gas in the extraplanar region at a constant value .",
    "the results of this study have implications for understanding the early evolution of ngc 55 in the context of the hierarchal formation model , although whether the envelope formed from the disruption of an early proto - disk or from the violent relaxation of proto - galactic gas clouds remains a matter of speculation .",
    "the absence of obvious metallicity gradients indicates that the envelope formed in a highly coherent manner or has been well mixed since its formation .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that the mean metallicity of the envelope around ngc 55 coincides with the point where the dynamical properties of the globular cluster system in the milky - way changes from orbits that are indicative of a pressure - supported system to one that has a significant rotational component ( zinn 1985 ) , and this provides indirect evidence for a disk origin .",
    "efforts to study the shape of the envelope will help constrain the origin of this structure . if the envelope originated from the disruption of a protodisk then it should not have a markedly flattened distribution .",
    "the issue of how the envelope formed notwithstanding , that the rgb stars in the extraplanar region are old and typically have [ fe / h ] @xmath141 indicates that they likely formed from material that experienced rapid early enrichment .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the age - metallicity relation of the lmc during early epochs , which de vaucouleurs ( 1961 ) argues is a galaxy that is structurally similar to ngc 55 .",
    "the lmc age - metallicity relation climbs from [ fe / h ] @xmath142 to 1 over a 3 gyr period during early epochs ( hill et al .",
    "2000 ) , and an age dispersion of this size would affect the agb - tip brightness in @xmath27 in ngc 55 by only @xmath143 mag (  4.2 ) , making it difficult to detect .",
    "if the age - metallicity relations of ngc 55 and the lmc are similar then the absence of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath144 would indicate that there should be no stars with ages less than @xmath5 gyr in the envelope around ngc 55 , and this is consistent with the age inferred from the agb - tip .",
    "the chemical content of stars in the envelope around ngc 55 will provide additional clues into the origin of this structure . while there are as yet no abundance measurements of stars in the outer envelope of ngc 55 , measurements of this nature",
    "have been made for metal - poor giants in the lmc , and the results are of interest in the context of the early evolution of magellanic irregular galaxies .",
    "hill et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that the metal - poor giants in the lmc fall along the trend between [ o / h ] and [ fe / h ] defined by galactic giants , suggesting that the metal - poor stars in the lmc may have formed in an environment similar to that from which the galactic halo formed . however , the number of lmc giants in the hill et al .",
    "( 2000 ) sample is tiny , amounting to only four objects .",
    "the globular cluster content of ngc 55 may present a problem for models in which the envelope around ngc 55 formed as the result of an early , violent collapse .",
    "if globular clusters form in supergiant molecular clouds ( e.g. harris & pudritz 1994 ) that are associated with the major collapse events that are expected to produce rapid chemical enrichment , then a number of globular clusters might be expected in ngc 55 given the age and metallicity properties of stars in the envelope .",
    "indeed , the lmc contains ten globular clusters with ages older than 10 gyr ( e.g. geisler et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the majority of these are metal - poor , with [ fe / h ] @xmath145 ( e.g. hill et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it appears that ngc 55 does not contain a large cluster population , and may have a globular cluster content that differs from that of the lmc .",
    "da costa & graham ( 1982 ) found three cluster candidates , one of which was identified as a young globular cluster , while liller & alcaino ( 1983 ) found five candidate clusters .",
    "however , the nature of the clusters detected in these early surveys is in doubt , as beasley & sharples ( 2000 ) obtained spectra of a number of globular cluster candidates and concluded that the vast majority of these are background galaxies , with only one being a bona fide globular cluster .    the origin of the envelope around ngc 55 notwithstanding",
    ", the absence of a large population of young or intermediate age stars in the envelope indicates that the disk of ngc 55 has not been disrupted by major merger activity for a large fraction of the hubble time ; the conditions for a stable disk to form in this galaxy were evidently in place early on .",
    "in fact , ngc 55 is in a relatively isolated environment .",
    "it is one of four galaxies that are on the near side of the sculptor group , and the largest member of this mini - group is ngc 300 .",
    "the crossing time of this four galaxy ensemble is almost 19 gyr ( karachentsev et al . 2003 ) ; consequently , the number of galaxy - to - galaxy interactions is expected to be small .",
    "nevertheless , there are hints that ngc 55 may have been involved in recent interactions .",
    "the hi disk of ngc 55 is warped ( hummel et al . 1986 ) , while ngc 55 is a barred galaxy , and bars are difficult to form without an external trigger , such as tidal interactions ( e.g. bottema 2003 ) .",
    "this being said , the bar of the lmc contains a large population of stars with ages of at least a few gyr ( ardeberg et al . 1997 ; smecker - hane et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggesting that the bars in magellanic irregular galaxies can be long - lived , and so may not be indicative of recent interactions .",
    "the rgb - tip occurs near @xmath9 in the thick disk of ngc 55 , indicating that the distance modulus of this galaxy is 26.5 .",
    "this distance measurement is likely not affected by dust internal to ngc 55 , as the brightness of the rgb - tip does not change with distance off of the disk , and any dust will likely be concentrated close to the disk plane .",
    "the distance modulus of ngc 55 measured from the rgb - tip is larger than that computed previously from other indicators (  1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , given the distances to other nearby galaxies in this part of the sky ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2003 ) , the distance estimated from the rgb - tip still makes ngc 55 one of the nearest members of the sculptor group .",
