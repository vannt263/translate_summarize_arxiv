    "in the past there has been the rather damning prejudice that all transverse - spin effects ( if not indeed spin effects _ tout court _ ) should _ vanish _ at very high energies ( , where mass effects may be neglected ) .",
    "this has led to a general lack of interest in the subject on both the experimental and theoretical sides , with some notable exceptions .",
    "this is now known _ not _ to be the case .    indeed , in the near future ( and already to some extent )",
    "the interest at the level of the in generic deeply - inelastic hadron scattering is due to shift from unpolarised ( and even longitudinally polarised ) hadrons to transversely polarised states .",
    "while , on the one hand , the first natural question to ask is simply the magnitude of the relevant partonic densities , on the other ( however , intimately related ) , there is the problem of evolution and the general framework of perturbative .",
    "a schematic overview of this talk is then as follows :    * brief history and notation * operator - product expansion and renormalisation group * evolution + - * * leading order * * next - to - leading order * * effects on asymmetries * * effects on the soffer bound * a definition *  @xmath0 factor * comments and concluding remarks      the history of transversity ( the concept though not the precise terminology ) begins as early as @xcite with its introduction by @xcite via the drell  yan process . shortly following this the anomalous dimensions were first calculated by @xcite and  promptly forgotten !",
    "this decided lack of interest may be partly traced to the inaccessibility of transversity via the archetypal parton - model process : namely , . indeed , as we shall see , the typical process in which transversity may be measured involves at least _ two _ polarised hadrons .",
    "a further obstacle was created by the common theoretical prejudice , already mentioned , according to which precisely _ transverse - spin _ effects ( , asymmetries ) should actually vanish at high energies .",
    "the reasons for such a belief lie in the requirement of chirality - flip in the relevant amplitudes , a property _ not _ enjoyed under typical circumstances by a theory of nearly massless fermions interacting via gauge bosons ; however , as shown by @xcite , it turns out that there are indeed several ( otherwise standard ) processes in which such effects are on a par with the unpolarised and helicity - weighted cross - sections .    during the period of great revival witnessed by the spin community , following the emc revelations regarding the proton spin ,",
    "the anomalous dimensions for transversity distributions were recalculated by @xcite .",
    "it is worth recalling that , in fact , these calculations had also already been , so to speak , unwittingly performed ( as contributions to the evolution of the structure function @xmath1 ) by : @xcite , and @xcite .    with the typical precision of modern measurements , a complete knowledge of the radiative corrections up to is indispensable ; in the case of transversity the anomalous dimensions were calculated by : @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "armed with results of such calculations , it is then possible to proceed with an examination of the phenomenological effects of evolution : studies have been performed by a number of authors ; the interested reader is referred to a recent review paper by @xcite , where indeed more details of much of what follows may be found .",
    "the lectures by @xcite also provide a useful pedagogical presentation while an important early technical discussion laying down the ground rules was given by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , owing to the somewhat sparse theoretical effort , the literature now abounds with conflicting notation in regard of the transversity distributions . for a list and discussion ,",

    "note , however , that chirality flip is not a problem if the quark lines of opposite chirality connect to different hadrons , as for example in the process .",
    "let us now place transversity in its proper context , together with the better known spin - averaged and helicity - weighted parton densities .",
    "note , of course , although we have just seen that a transversity contribution to fully inclusive is precluded , this is merely due to the nature of that particular process and not to any fundamental suppression or absence of transversity itself .",
    "thus , it is more useful to simply consider the corresponding partonic densities .",

    ": it corresponds to linearly polarised states in a transversely polarised hadron .",
    "however , conventional wisdom has it that , owing to @xmath22-channel helicity conservation , a spin - half baryon can not support the two units of spin - flip necessary for gluon transversity and thus one is led to the perhaps somewhat surprising conclusion that gluons may _ not _ be transversely polarised inside transversely polarised baryons !",
    "now , i should point out that such an argument does not take into account orbital - angular momentum !",
    "let me simply recall that the kernels inevitably generate orbital - angular momentum @xcite ; thus it might be that gluon transversity can be generated in a composite object such as a baryon ; no calculations to such effect exist though .",
    "this problem apart , it is certainly true , as we shall see shortly , that the _ quark _ and _ gluon _ transversity densities evolve _",

    "recall that the principal tool of this approach is the use of a physical ( axial or light - like ) gauge , in which none but the ladder ( planar ) diagrams survive the requirement of a large logarithm .",
    "in such a gauge the one - loop kernels for the leading - twist structures are given by the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1pi - kernel ] .",
    "gluonrung1    ( 40,30 )    in the case of transversity the diagram has a different helicity structure to those of the spin - averaged and helicity - weighted cases and thus , not surprisingly , the anomalous dimensions are different in this case .",

    "[ fig:1pi - kernel - mixing ] .",
    "fermionrung1    ( 40,30 )    once again the helicity - conserving nature of gauge theories in the massless ( or high - energy ) limit leads to a peculiarity in the case of transversity : evolution of transversity is _ non - singlet _ like .",
    "thus , even where a gluon transversity may exist ( , in the deuteron ) there is no mixing between the flavour - singlet quark and gluon transversity densities : the two evolve independently .",
    "this means that , for example , for equal statistical precision , the experimental study of transversity evolution would provide a far better evaluation of , say , @xmath29 ; recall that in the spin - averaged and too in the helicity - weighted cases the strong correlation between @xmath29 and the ill - determined gluon distributions drastically reduces the significance of the extracted value of @xmath29 .",
    "note also that the usually quoted values for @xmath29 essentially come from sum - rule measurements and thus from wilson coefficient corrections and not evolution .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the problem via a method suggested by @xcite .",

    "note that for both @xmath45 and @xmath46 the first moments _ vanish _ ( a consequence of vector and axial - vector conservation implying the existence of sum rules corresponding , , to the total charge and the neutron beta - decay axial coupling @xmath47 ) while for @xmath48 the same is not true and the sign implies a falling first moment ( the so - called tensor charge ) for transversity .",
    "while such a suppression of transversity has obvious negative implications for high - energy measurements in terms of the size of effect ( asymmetry ) one might hope to measure , it does also indicate a more rapid evolution than in the other two leading - twist cases .",

    "all three kernels behave similarly for @xmath57 .",
    "it is also natural to ask how the question of orbital angular momentum develops in the case of transversity .",
    "now , since @xmath58 and @xmath54 evolve independently ( recall there is no mixing ) , the total spin fraction of each of the two parton types must be conserved _",
    "separately_. thus ,",
    "in the usual way , the splitting functions necessarily generate compensating orbital angular momentum , but for each separately .",
    "given that @xmath58 _ decreases _ with increasing @xmath59 , @xmath60 must _ increase _ in magnitude ( assuming a `` primordial '' value of zero ) with the _ same sign _ as the initial quark spin ; the final value will however be limited .",
    "in contrast , @xmath54 increases without bound ( just as @xmath52 ) ; thus , @xmath61 must also increase in magnitude , but with the _ opposite sign _ to the initial gluon spin .",
    "the physical implications of evolution for the transversity distributions may now be examined .",

    "in addition , the transversity distribution is constrained by a much less obvious bound derived by @xcite .",
    "the derivation , which we shall follow somewhat schematically , is an instructive example of the necessity of considering _ amplitudes _ and not simple _ probability densities _ when dealing with problems involving spin states .",
    "the central point here is the presence of both longitudinal _ and _ transverse spin states ; thus either one or the other must be translated into a different basis .",
    "it is useful to introduce the following hadron ",
    "parton amplitudes :        in terms of which the various partonic densities may be expressed as various combinations , @xmath80 using these quantities it is then possible to construct a rather non - trivial schwartz - type inequality : @xmath81 which in turn leads to @xmath82 this last inequality is precisely the soffer bound , which interestingly involves all three leading - twist distributions .",
    "such a bound can , of course , become particularly stringent in the case of helicity distributions that are negative , as is the case for the @xmath83 quark .",
    "the doubt immediately arises as to whether the bound is respected by evolution ; this is not at all a futile question since it is well known that evolution ( in particular , towards _ lower _ scales ) does not even respect the basic positivity of the _ un_-polarised densities .",
    "this problem can be traced to the fact that partonic densities are not physical quantities and thus beyond the they are not well defined .",
    "a quark seen by a photon may be `` primordial '' in origin ( in some definition ) or be part of a @xmath84 pair created from a primordial gluon ( in another ) .",
    "a redefinition of the densities may lead to a gluonic contribution to the physical cross - section _ exceeding _ the total cross - section .",
    "this will in turn determine a negative implied value for the primordial quark densities .",
    "now , the problem is different at and . at leading order",
    "there are no ambiguities and one merely has to inspect the form of the kernels . at",
    "there is no unique definition of the kernels and the situation is more complicated .",
    "let us start by examining the situation at .",
    "maintenance of the soffer bound under evolution has been argued by @xcite .",
    "it is indeed possible to make rather general arguments : the non - singular terms in the kernels are always positive definite and thus can not affect positivity statements .",
    "however , the ir singular ( `` plus '' regularised ) terms in the kernel are negative and thus in principle can affect inequalities such as that of soffer .",
    "let us rewrite the plus - regularised terms in the following manner : @xmath85 the equations can then be recast in a boltzmann form : @xmath86 one sees that the negative term on the right - hand side is `` diagonal '' in @xmath8 and thus can not change the sign of @xmath87 , since @xmath87 must go through zero to turn negative , at which point the evolution switches off .",
    "thus , let us write @xmath88 then , positivity of the initial distributions , @xmath89 or @xmath90 , will certainly be preserved if both kernels @xmath91 are positive , which is indeed true .",
    "such an argument can also be extended in a straight - forward manner to the singlet distributions .",
    "a generalisation of this argument leads to maintenance of the soffer bound under evolution : consideration of the combinations @xmath92 and their evolution kernels indeed demonstrates the stability of the soffer bound under evolution .",
    "moving on to , as mentioned earlier , the situation is more subtle . a general comment on positivity constraints concerns the well - known ( though _ oft forgotten _ ) ambiguity in the definition of a partonic density beyond the in .",
    "the physical interpretation of parton distributions or densities is well - defined and unique in the nave parton model and in _ only _ up to the . beyond the the coefficient functions and higher - order splitting kernels become renormalisation - scheme dependent .",
    "thus , for some arbitrary scheme adopting a given starting point ( in @xmath59 ) where positivity is obeyed , there can be no guarantee _ a priori _ of positivity at all @xmath59 .",
    "such an argument may be turned on its head : that is , such considerations could provide a criterion for choosing or preferring certain schemes . in other words , one might decide to adopt only those schemes in which positivity remains guaranteed at higher orders .",
    "however , it should be noted that since the unique physical meaning of a quark or a gluon beyond the is in any case necessarily lost , such an exercise has probably little or no physical significance , save perhaps that of possibly endowing numerical evolution programmes with greater stability .",
    "that is , it would avoid the creation of situations in which there are large ( essentially unphysical ) cancellations between opposite sign ( and individually positivity violating ) polarised quark and gluon densities  necessary to render the final physical cross - sections positivity respecting .",
    "a potentially worrisome and well - known aspect of all phenomenological parton studies is represented by the presence of non - negligible so - called @xmath0 factors .",
    "all the other twist - two distribution functions have a natural definition in , where indeed the parton model is usually formulated .",
    "however , when translated to , for example , large @xmath0 factors appear in the form of radiative corrections @xmath93 to the wilson coefficients . at rhic energies such",
    "a correction would be an order 30% contribution , while at the lower emc / smc energies it could even be as much as around 100% .",
    "now , in the case of transversity the pure coefficient functions are known to @xmath94 , but are scheme dependent .",
    "moreover , a @xmath95 term appears that is not found in either the spin - averaged or helicity - dependent .",
    "not only , there is also the problem mentioned earlier arising in connection with the vector ",
    "scalar current product .",
    "this last point is of some relevance as it is connected to a possible ( albeit hypothetical ) -type process , sensitive to the transversity densities .      in order to obtain a -like process in which transversity may play a rle",

    "examining the different curves , one sees that there is a non - vanishing difference for large @xmath107 , traceable to the differing residues at @xmath98 ; and a still larger difference for small @xmath107 , arising from the rather different functional forms involved in the numerator and denominator . that there should be such large differences , obviously becoming more important where @xmath29 is larger ( , for small @xmath107 and/or @xmath108 ) , must sound a warning bell to anyone considering making predictions based on models normalised to distributions , and likewise to anyone wishing to extract densities from -like measurements .    at this point",
    "one might object that the higher - order splitting kernels have also now been calculated , indeed for all three cases  see below , and thus the usual ambiguities are really only present at .",
    "in fact , the calculation of the two - loop anomalous dimensions for @xmath7 has been presented in three papers : @xcite and @xcite used the scheme in the feynman gauge while @xcite adopted the scheme in the gauge . these complement the earlier two - loop calculations for the two other better - known twist - two structure functions : @xmath109 @xcite and @xmath110 @xcite . however ,",
    "this is not quite the point , indeed there is actually no ambiguity in the expressions ( [ eq : wilson - nlo - f][subeq : wilson - nlo - h ] ) .",
    "most model calculations make some ( albeit indirect ) reference to and transversity densities are then normalised in parallel with the unpolarised densities . thus predictions for a cross - section should , for consistency , include something like the corrections calculated here .",
    "of course , it is hard to make the claim that the approach adopted here provides precisely the form of correction that really applies .",
    "however , the fact that even at the level of an asymmetry large corrections remain must be taken as a warning that transversity densities too could reserve surprises .",
    "note that such observations have absolutely no relevance though to the question of pure evolution .",
    "by way of concluding remarks let us simply try to recapitulate the important points touched in this all too brief presentation .",
    "first a few well - understood and theoretically clear points :    * both the non - singlet and non - mixing behaviour render transversity surprisingly simpler and more transparent to study , with respect to its better - known siblings , both from an experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "* at high energies evolution suppresses @xmath58 with respect to both @xmath100 and @xmath111 ; thus , first measurements will best be performed at lower values of @xmath59 .",
    "however , complementary high-@xmath59 measurements will always be required to perform meaningful evolution studies . *",
    "the previous observation may be turned on its head : transversity will be a wonderful place to study evolution as even the first moment evolves rather rapidly .",
    "* if the calculations reported here are at all indicative , the well - known large @xmath0 factors involved in the translation between and may , in the case of transversity , lead to rather unstable asymmetries and thus poorly defined extracted partonic densities . *",
    "if the argument leading to the conclusion that gluon transversity is excluded from spin - half baryons should turn out to be flawed , this might be a new indication of the importance of orbital angular momentum effects .",
    "i should remark that there has been neither the time or space here to discuss the very rich and interesting phenomenology associated with single - spin asymmetries , which could also turn out to be related to transversity ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    as a final word then",
    ", it should now be obvious that transverse - spin effects , far from being negligible and uninteresting at high energies , already from a solid theoretical viewpoint actually promise an interesting window onto the workings of evolution .",
    "moreover , the possibility of further spin - driven surprises from this experimentally new sector is not to be ignored and the theory community is now eagerly awaiting the first data .",
