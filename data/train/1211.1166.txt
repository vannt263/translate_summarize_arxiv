    "in comparison with the expected hadronic decays , phenix measured a significant excess of @xmath5 pairs in the invariant mass range of 0.10.7 gev in au+au collisions  @xcite , while no such excess is present in p+p collisions  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results from star also show a substantial , although smaller effect in a different geometrical acceptance  @xcite .",
    "this low - mass dilepton enhancement is the subject of detailed theoretical investigations , and , according to a recent conference report  @xcite , the enhancement is not yet fully understood .",
    "lattice results  @xcite suggest that the transition to chirally symmetric and deconfined matter is a smooth , cross - over type transition , where the chiral symmetry restoration as measured by chiral susceptibility happens at a significantly lower temperature than the confinement of quarks , as measured by the polyakov loop .",
    "the continuum extrapolated value for the transition temperature of the renormalized polyakov loop is 25@xmath64 mev higher than that of the chiral susceptibility .",
    "this result suggests an interesting possibility of chiral hadron dynamics in the 150175 mev temperature range .",
    "chiral symmetry restoration may change various properties of hadrons , such as their mass , width , branching ratios and decays .",
    "the phenix collaboration was the first to publish the direct photon spectrum in @xmath0=200 gev au+au collisions  @xcite , where the average temperature of the photon emitted region was found to be 220@xmath619_(stat)_@xmath619_(syst ) _ mev , implying that the initial temperature was at least about 300 mev , significantly larger than both the hagedorn temperature ( the upper limit of the existence of hadrons , @xmath7170 mev ) and the kinetic freeze - out temperature ( where hadronic interactions cease , in the order of @xmath8@xmath7140 mev . )    the in - medium drop of the mass of the @xmath4meson was anticipated a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 meson is different from the other pseudoscalar mesons in the sense that , due to the axial anomaly , it has a very large mass ( @xmath10 mev ) which prevents it from acting as the 9^th^ pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "however , in a hot and dense hadronic medium where the chiral symmetry is partially restored , the mass of the @xmath4can be reduced substantially , to the proximity of its quark model value ( @xmath7500 mev ) , to the mass - range of the other pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the first indirect observation of in - medium chiral dynamics , based on bose - einstein correlation ( bec ) measurements and on the analysis of the @xmath9@xmath11@xmath12@xmath11@xmath13 decay chain , suggested a significant and an at least 200 mev in - medium mass drop of the @xmath4mesons in these reactions  @xcite .",
    "these results triggered renewed interest in theoretical investigations of @xmath3 symmetry restoration : the witten - veneziano formula has been generalized to finite temperature to check if the indirectly measured in - medium @xmath4masses are in the theoretically acceptable range  @xcite , lattice qcd calculations were performed to study the temperature dependence of the @xmath3 symmetry restoration  @xcite . in cold nuclear matter",
    ", the nuclear bound states and partial restoration of the @xmath4mass was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , to mention just some of the most inspiring new results .    the indirect observation of in - medium @xmath4mass modification in refs .",
    "@xcite is based on a hadronic decay channel . in this work ,",
    "we cross - check this effect in the dilepton spectrum , utilizing the @xmath9@xmath11@xmath14 ( dalitz ) decay channel .",
    "this channel contributes to the low mass region ( below @xmath71 gev ) , where the observed excess is present  @xcite .",
    "we also show that radial flow effects play an important role in understanding the measured dilepton spectrum .",
    "since the new star and phenix data  @xcite are preliminary , we restrict our studies to the published phenix data  @xcite .",
    "we have to keep in mind that other meson properties may also change in the hot and dense hadronic medium .",
    "the disappearance of the @xmath3 anomaly predominantly affects the @xmath4meson , and therefore no significant mass drop is anticipated for the other mesons due to the restoration of this symmetry",
    ". however , strong interactions on the hot and dense , hadronic matter may lead to additional mass modifications as well as collisional broadening of resonance decay widths , see e.g  ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "this is usually formalized through the time evolution of spectral functions as given by the kadanoff - baym equations  @xcite . from eq .",
    "( 157 ) of that paper , the collisional broadening of the @xmath4can be estimated to be approximately half of that of the @xmath15 meson , well below the 50 mev binning of the phenix dilepton spectrum of ref .",
    "thus in the present paper we do not consider these effects .",
    "this is in contrast to those cases where the interactions among the different mesons play a non - negligible role , such as a possible collisional broadening of the @xmath16 meson , where even a relatively small increase of the 150  mev vacuum width is experimentally accessible .",
    "a recent measurement of the taps collaboration  @xcite reported such broadening of the @xmath4 in cold nuclear matter to @xmath17@xmath71525 mev from the vacuum value of @xmath18@xmath70.2 mev .",
    "results from anke @xcite also point towards an enormous broadening of mesons in cold nuclear matter .",
    "the broadening of the @xmath15 meson width from 4 mev to 35 - 50 mev @xcite is approximately two times that of the broadening observed for the @xmath4 , and it is comparable to the 50 mev bin size of the phenix measurement . both the @xmath9 and @xmath19 resonances are , however , very narrow ( @xmath20=1.30@xmath60.07 kev and @xmath21=204@xmath615 kev ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the present analysis to broadening effects is predominantly limited by the statistics in the range of the low mass dilepton enhancement .",
    "although the temperature dependence of the broadening effects is not clear , the fact that our simulations reproduce the position , the shape and also the transverse momentum dependence of the @xmath15 meson within 12 standard deviations without further tuning , gives us confidence that a possible broadening of the 20 times narrower @xmath4is not observable within the current bin sizes .",
    "more detailed experimental data , however , may allow for a direct observation of the possible broadening of the width of @xmath4 in hot hadronic matter .",
    "the na60 collaboration reported the first measurement of the broadening of the @xmath16 spectral function  @xcite , based on a low - mass dilepton measurement in a similar kinematic range as the phenix low mass dilepton enhancement , in @xmath22 agev in - in collisions at the cern sps  @xcite .",
    "the associated spectral function of the @xmath16 meson indicates significant broadening , but the position of the in - medium @xmath16 mass peak was found to be in agreement with the vacuum value within experimental errors  @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism , however , is not able to fully account for the phenix low - mass dilepton enhancement in @xmath0=200 gev au+au reactions  @xcite .",
    "also note that , contrary to rhic collisions , a previous analysis of na44 s+pb data in the bec channel showed no significant @xmath4mass drop at @xmath0=19.4 gev  @xcite .",
    "this indicates an expressive change of chiral dynamics between the cern sps top energy of @xmath0=19.4 gev and the rhic energies of @xmath0=60 , 130 and 200 gev ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details on this point ) .",
    "the method we utilize here is fully consistent with the methods applied in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is an indirect @xmath4mass modification measurement using bose - einstein correlations of pions from @xmath4chain decays .",
    "as far as we know ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this is the first statistically acceptable description of the low - mass dilepton enhancement in 200 gev au+au collisions at rhic , as we shall demonstrate below .",
    "still , there are several possibilities for further improvements .",
    "ideally all the in - medium effects should be considered simultaneously . in this analysis , however , we restrict ourselves in exploring the complex phenomenon of chiral symmetry restoration only to the mass modification of the @xmath4meson , which is expected to be the most prominent effect , especially at the lower temperatures of the hadronic phase .",
    "as a result of a possible chiral symmetry restoration the mass of the @xmath9 meson can change significantly .",
    "this mass modification , however , can not be observed directly due to the small inelastic and annihilation cross - section ( @xmath23@xmath72.6 mb ) and the large lifetime ( @xmath2410 fm/@xmath25 ) of the @xmath4 in the medium with an asterisk , while quantities without further notation correspond to the free @xmath9 throughout this paper . ] .",
    "similarly to our previous investigations in  @xcite we thus neglect the decays of @xmath26 in the medium , but consider how the in - medium @xmath26 enhancement can be observed after the medium dissolves and these @xmath26 mesons become on - shell and decay in the vacuum .",
    "this enhancement can be described with a modified hagedorn - formula  @xcite :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the vacuum mass- , @xmath29 is the in - medium mass of the @xmath9 meson , while @xmath30is the characteristic inverse slope of the @xmath4mesons within the formed medium .",
    "note that many of the arguments presented in this section resemble earlier ones that considered a possible low transverse momentum enhancement of photons and pions , k@xmath31 mesons and antiprotons  @xciteenhancement of k@xmath31 .",
    "our arguments specifically relate to the connection of the @xmath4meson to the @xmath3 anomaly and the resulting well known and large mass difference between the @xmath19 and @xmath4mesons , as emphasized in the context of heavy ion phenomenology first in refs .",
    "@xcite . ] . in order to explore the role of @xmath9 meson enhancement in the @xmath32 gev",
    "au+au collision data of phenix  @xcite , extended exodus simulations were elaborated to generate different dilepton spectra corresponding to physically reasonable @xmath9 properties .",
    "[ f : ppg088 ]      according to the conservation of energy , those @xmath9 mesons that can escape from the hot and dense hadronic medium , while regaining their mass , must lose momentum .",
    "as we compare our simulations to data in the phenix acceptance ( @xmath33 ) , we neglect the longitudinal component of the momentum for the purpose of this work .",
    "thus the conservation of energy requires @xmath9 mesons to fulfill the @xmath34 relation .",
    "this condition results in two different components of the @xmath9 spectrum .",
    "both components realize an effective @xmath35+@xmath36@xmath11@xmath37+@xmath38 transition , but in a different way .    some of the @xmath9 meson s transverse momenta is large enough to let them escape from the hot and dense @xmath3 restored medium to the asymptotic vacuum by decreasing their momenta and increasing their mass .",
    "they yield the first component of the @xmath4spectrum , which is dominant in the @xmath39@xmath24@xmath40=@xmath41 region and follows a nearly exponential spectrum similar to other hadrons , and can be described with the same hydrodynamical model .",
    "those @xmath9 mesons , however , that have low transverse momentum mesons with @xmath42 as a result of conservation of energy ( eq .  [ e : cons ] ) ] in the chirally modified vacuum , can not come on mass shell thus they are trapped in that modified vacuum .",
    "they are released and come on - shell only after the dissociation of the modified vacuum state to the asymptotic vacuum , thus they are emitted with a small @xmath39 , characteristic to the decaying condensate .",
    "this second component of the @xmath4spectrum may be dominant at low-@xmath39if there is a significant in - medium @xmath4mass decrease .",
    "the trapped @xmath9 mesons are assumed to follow a maxwell  boltzmann - like distribution , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the slope parameter of the @xmath9 condensate .",
    "the final @xmath9 spectrum is the sum of eq .",
    "( [ e : etap_low_pt ] ) and the hydrodynamical spectrum , which results in a double exponential spectrum as used in refs .  @xcite and also in the current analysis .",
    "another idea which might bring us closer to understand the dilepton excess is to introduce a new @xmath39-distribution with radial flow for the mesons .",
    "the radial flow leads to larger effective slope parameters for heavier resonances in the soft , 0@xmath1@xmath39@xmath12 gev part of the spectrum .",
    "in contrast , phenix used a background where resonance spectra were extrapolated to this region using @xmath45-scaling .",
    "radial flow breaks the @xmath45-scaling of single particle spectra .",
    "this effect , as far as we know , was not included in the original phenix analysis  @xcite .",
    "radial flow is valid in the low @xmath39range , where it describes particle spectra well .",
    "this region is also the most important one for the dilepton spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ f : ppg088 ] the original phenix result  @xcite and a resonance @xmath39@xmath12 gev ) cut result are plotted , confirming the dominance of the low-@xmath39part of the spectra . thus examining",
    "the effect of the radial flow seems to be inevitable , as it might be responsible for certain parts of the excess .",
    "previous examinations suggested that a spectrum motivated by perfect hydrodynamics can give a better estimate of the low-@xmath39regime for all mesons .",
    "we made use of the following simplified hydrodinamical formula , which was first derived for non - central heavy - ion collisions as an exact solution of hydrodynamics @xcite , but it is also applied in phenomenological models  @xcite and in data analysis  @xcite :    @xmath46    hydrodynamical models usually describe the primordially created particles , but not their decay products .",
    "this effect is important in case of the @xmath47 meson , which can be a daughter of many other hadrons .",
    "thus we corrected the measured pion spectrum using the core - halo ( c - h ) picture  @xcite .",
    "primordial pions ( together with decay products of rapidly decaying resonances that yield thermalized pions ) are in the core , the hydrodynamically evolving medium , while decay product pions of long lived resonances form the halo farther away from the collision point .",
    "thus if we divide the measured @xmath48 spectrum with @xmath49 we get an estimate for the number of core pions .",
    "an upper boundary on the corrections for neutral pions was obtained by averaging the @xmath50 and @xmath51 c - h corrections  @xcite , @xmath52=@xmath53 , while the lower boundary was @xmath54=@xmath55 , based on the consideration that long lived resonances do not produce more than twice as much charge as neutral pions .",
