    "it is now widely accepted that the energy source powering qsos is gravitational in nature and that it involves some form of accretion of matter onto a compact massive object in the center of a galaxy , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "but it has long been clear that such an object will fairly quickly swallow up most of the material that comes within its vicinity and normal relaxation processes repopulate such orbits far too slowly to sustain the power output of a qso .",
    "we are left with the problem first clearly posed by @xcite : how does one feed the monster ? as if anticipating the problem , @xcite suggested the importance of interactions and mergers as fueling mechanisms in the section `` stoking the furnace ? '' of their classic paper `` galactic bridges and tails '' , where they muse : `` would not the violent mechanical agitation of a close tidal encounter ",
    "let alone an actual merger  already tend to bring _ deep _ into a galaxy a fairly _ sudden _ supply of fresh fuel in the form of interstellar material , either from its own outlying disk or by accretion from its partner ? ''",
    "toomre & toomre s suggestion was specifically in reference to galaxies showing vigorous nuclear star formation .",
    "however , it was only a small step to apply the same scenario to qso activity , a connection explicitly made by @xcite in a study of compact companions to qsos .",
    "many attempts to connect most or all qso activity with interactions and mergers followed , and circumstantial evidence supporting this connection was rapidly accumulated .",
    "a variety of morphological distortions were seen in the host galaxies , ranging from simple asymmetries to clear bridge - like or tail - like structures ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there seemed to be a statistical excess of close companion galaxies ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "highly structured distributions of extended ionized gas were found around qsos ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reviews and evaluates these and other examples and points out that what keeps these observations from having more weight as evidence for a connection between interactions and the triggering of qso activity is the lack of a suitable control sample .",
    "it was in this context that the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) made the remarkable discovery of a new class of galaxies , the luminous infrared galaxies , which emit the bulk of their energy at infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "many of these galaxies showed unambiguous signs of tidal interaction @xcite , and the interaction rate was observed to increase with luminosity .",
    "in particular , virtually all of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( _ i.e. , _  those having luminosities @xmath1 l@xmath2 ; henceforth uligs ) , were found to be involved in mergers ( see @xcite for a review ) .    up until the time of _ iras",
    "_ , qsos were the only objects known to have bolometric luminosities greater than @xmath3 l@xmath2 , so it was natural to speculate about about a relation between qsos and the newly discovered uligs .",
    "@xcite noticed that uligs and qsos had not only similar bolometric luminosities , but also similar space densities . in other words , uligs were numerous enough to be the parent population for qsos , and their infrared luminosities could simply be due to qso flux being re - radiated at longer wavelengths .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that uligs may play a dominant role in the formation of all qsos .",
    "the picture put forward was that uligs were the result of strong interactions or mergers which funneled gaseous material into the central regions of galaxies , thus fueling intense star formation and the qso activity .",
    "uligs were then dust - enshrouded qsos which , after blowing away the dust , became classical qsos .",
    "this hypothesis has sparked much debate regarding the main source that powers uligs : is it powerful starbursts @xcite or agns @xcite ?",
    "( 1998 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have looked for the presence or absence of a true high brightness temperature agn - like radio core in uligs ; @xcite and @xcite use the strength of the 7.7 @xmath4 m pah line to continuum ratio to determine the fraction of the infrared / submillimeter luminosity peak in spectral energy distributions ( seds ) that is due to a starburst and an agn respectively , and @xcite have compared the dominant contributor from this analysis with the classification from optical / ir emission lines , finding general agreement ; @xcite have used _ asca _ hard x - ray observations to estimate the agn contribution to the total luminosity ; @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others , have looked for hidden qso broad emission lines in scattered polarized light in uligs .",
    "these are only a few examples of the myriad of tests at virtually every observable wavelength that have been applied to uligs with the goal of determining the nature of the main energy source .",
    "although some uncertainty remains , it appears that @xmath5% of uligs are dominated by agns @xcite and that this fraction rises at the highest luminosities @xcite .",
    "the limited attempts to address the question of evolution from the other side of the fence ( in other words , to look at qso host galaxies specifically in search for traces of a ulig phase ) pale in comparison .",
    "progress in this area has been damped by the difficulty in studying qso host galaxies , as observations are invariably hampered by the enormous brightness of the qso nuclei .",
    "it is not too surprising that even _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) observations of host galaxies caused some confusion at first .",
    "@xcite originally presented a scandalous set of `` naked '' qsos , claiming that no galaxy as bright as @xmath6 could be detected in 5 out of a sample of 8 low - redshift qsos .",
    "later , mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) showed that , with suitable smoothing , @xmath6 galaxies were indeed detectable on the same _ hst _ images , and concluded that most qsos are in normal , early - type galaxies .",
    "efforts in the last decade have concentrated on characterizing qso host galaxies and , in particular , searching for any possible differences between the hosts of radio - loud and radio - quiet objects ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as continuing to explore the connection to interactions and mergers as means to trigger the nuclear activity ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , all the evidence connecting qsos to mergers remains _",
    "circumstantial_.    systematic studies to attempt to trace qsos to uligs have been few and limited to imaging studies of host galaxy morphologies .",
    "@xcite observed a complete sample of pg qsos with infrared excesses similar to those of warm uligs .",
    "he finds that 22% are unmistakably the result of galaxy mergers , and that the @xmath7-band luminosities of the hosts of all the objects in the sample are consistent with those found in uligs . @xcite",
    "compares the far infrared properties of qsos in disturbed and undisturbed hosts in the pg survey , and finds that the mean 60  @xmath4 m luminosity of the qsos with disturbed hosts is several times greater than that of qsos with undisturbed hosts .",
    "this result would be in agreement with a scenario where the disturbed - host qsos are at an earlier stage in their evolution from uligs to classical qsos .    these and other efforts have concentrated on the connection between qsos and uligs via morphologies indicative of mergers .",
    "an area that has been virtually ignored , except for the occasional qualitative comment , is the detailed study of the potential connection between both families via _ starbursts_. while the starburst ",
    "agn connection itself has been the subject of much recent research , no systematic effort has been made to attempt to detect such starbursts in the host galaxies of qsos .",
    "in particular , relatively few spectroscopic observations of qso host galaxies have been published @xcite .",
    "the majority of these have been limited to reporting the presence of absorption lines in the spectra of host galaxies , and most studies have been of isolated cases .",
    "again , this is not surprising considering the difficulties in observing a low surface brightness object only a few arcseconds ( in the best of cases ) away from its @xmath8 times brighter nucleus .",
    "one group @xcite is currently carrying out a systematic spectroscopic study of radio galaxies and both radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos , but their emphasis is in characterizing the old populations ( while treating any possible recent starburst components as a nuisance ) and describing differences among the hosts of the three classes of objects .",
    "thus , it is in this mostly unexplored territory of spectroscopy of qso host galaxies that we have focussed our efforts .",
    "our approach to the question of evolution is as follows : in the evolutionary scenario , objects are expected to transition at some point from an ultraluminous infrared phase to a `` normal '' qso phase ; we shall refer to objects in this latter phase as `` classical qsos . ''",
    "our intent is to define a group of `` transition '' objects , _",
    "i.e. , _  objects that share characteristics with both qsos and uligs , and , through both imaging and spectroscopic observations , answer the questions : _ `` where did they come from ? '' _ , and _",
    "`` where will they go ? '' _ if the answers to these questions were unambiguously determined to be , respectively , `` from the ulig population , '' and `` to the classical qso population '' , the evolutionary scenario would be confirmed for at least one class of qsos , and statistical considerations could then tell us whether the process is relevant to the majority of qsos . in the following section we address the problem of how to come up with a sample of transition objects ,",
    "describe our selection criteria , and present our sample .",
    "results for the first 5 objects in the sample have been published in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( hereafter cs97 , cs00a , cs00b , and scc98 , respectively ) . in ",
    "[ chap5 ] we analyze and present results for the last 4 objects in the sample : iras00275@xmath92859 , iras04505@xmath92958 , pg1543 + 489 , and izw1 . in ",
    "[ agesum ] we summarize the observed and derived properties of all the objects in the sample , in  [ properties ] we discuss these properties individually , and in  [ together ] we present a model that accounts for all of them in the context of our main results .",
    "we discuss other possible tests of the evolutionary paradigm in  [ further ] and present an overview and summary in  [ summary ] .",
    "it is possible to select a sample of objects that may be in some transitionary phase by choosing a set of bona fide qsos that share a given characteristic with uligs .",
    "we could , for example , choose those qsos that have recent signs of interaction .",
    "however , the selection of such a sample would be very subjective , and it would be virtually impossible to collect a complete sample and/or to come up with a suitable control sample . in an effort to avoid some of these problems ,",
    "we have chosen to use far infrared colors to form a nearly complete sample .",
    "the far infrared ( fir ) color  color diagram has been used as a tool to detect and discriminate between different types of activity in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of galaxies .",
    "the spectral indices plotted in the diagram are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are obtained from the _ iras _ flux densities at 100 @xmath4 m , 60 @xmath4 m , and 25 @xmath4 m .",
    "different kinds of objects , such as qsos / seyferts , starbursts , and powerful ir galaxies , occupy fairly well defined regions in the diagram ( see , _",
    "e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "objects whose fir fluxes are dominated by reradiation from dust will be preferentially located around the black - body region of the diagram , while those with strong non - thermal emission , such as optically selected qsos , are found near the power - law region ( see fig .",
    "[ sampleplot ] ) .",
    "@xcite plot in the fir diagram the 22 qsos detected in the _ iras _ all - sky survey which have good quality fluxes at the relevant bands ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) , and note that the majority ( 19 ) lie close to the line of constant spectral index ( dubbed power - law in fig .",
    "[ sampleplot ] ) .",
    "@xcite noticed that the other three qsos , which fell near the region of the diagram occupied by luminous ir galaxies ( mrk231 , mrk1014 , and 3c48 ) were also at the time the three qsos that were arguably the three best examples of qsos that showed apparent stellar tidal tails .",
    "stockton & ridgway proposed that these qsos are either transitional objects in an evolutionary scenario , or exceptional or extreme examples which are distinct from the general qso population .",
    "@xcite found an independent correlation using the fir diagram : infrared - loud agn having extreme emission have positions intermediate between the black - body and power - law regions , while those having less extreme , but still strong , emission lie closer to the power - law region .",
    "lpari proposed that the strength of the emission lines might be associated with the phase of the starburst / superwind of type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "extreme emitters would then be uligs at the end phase of a strong starburst , and strong emitters would be post - starburst objects .",
    "the fir diagram provides us with an opportunity to select a complete sample from those objects which have firm detections in the three relevant iras bands .",
    "the precise color limits we choose ( see below ) are somewhat arbitrary and are simply meant to define a reasonable sample of objects spanning a region in the fir two - color diagram intermediate between the ulig and classical qso populations .",
    "our goal is to collect as complete a sample as possible of low - redshift , bona - fide qsos with an intermediate position in the fir color  color diagram .",
    "our selection criteria are :    1 .   a luminosity above the cutoff defined for quasars by schmidt & green ( 1983 ) , _",
    "@xmath12 ( or @xmath13 for @xmath14 kms@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 ) , 2 .   a redshift @xmath16 , 3 .   a declination @xmath17 , 4 .   firm _ iras _ detections at 25 @xmath4 m , 60 @xmath4 m , and 100 @xmath4 m , and 5 .",
    "a position in the fir color  color diagram which is intermediate between the ulig and qso loci , _",
    "i.e. , _  in the region delimited by @xmath18 and @xmath19    our starting point was the sample of 179 qsos observed with _ iras",
    "_ published by @xcite .",
    "to this sample we added the sample of warm objects by @xcite , where they find 6 previously unidentified qsos from a list of 187 sources .",
    "finally , we added the sample of 91 uligs ( of which 65 were newly discovered ) by @xcite , since some of these objects have agns which could possibly have qso luminosities . since none of these samples is complete , our sample can not be complete .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , we have included _ every known bona - fide qso _ which satisfies the 5 selection criteria .",
    "there are a few objects that will be either within or outside the sample color limits depending on which published _ iras _ flux values are used .",
    "we give priority to the flux values given by @xcite , since the majority of the qsos in that sample have `` pointed observations '' in addition to the all - sky survey observations .",
    "the additional observations result in an increase in sensitivity by a factor of @xmath20 .",
    "evidently , no pointed observations are available for those objects which were discovered by _ iras _ itself ; we use flux values from the faint source catalog for these .",
    "the restriction that objects in the sample must have firm detections at the three relevant _ iras _ bands ( see selection criterion number 4 above ) will bias the sample towards objects of higher ir luminosity . since many qsos have",
    "pointed observations that have various detection limits , it is difficult to establish the luminosity limit that the selection criterion imposes on the sample .",
    "however , by inspecting the ir luminosities , @xmath21 , of the qsos detected at these three bands , we find that objects out to @xmath22 have a mean log @xmath23 , and those with @xmath24 have log @xmath25 ( a precise definition of @xmath21 is given in  [ agesum ] ) . above redshifts @xmath26 , only ultraluminous ( log @xmath27 )",
    "objects are detected at the three bands .",
    "we use the @xmath28 magnitudes published by @xcite as a starting point to select objects . however , these magnitudes are not homogeneous and have varying uncertainties which could , in some cases , push objects in or out of the sample . therefore , in order to have as complete a sample as possible , we have considered all objects which satisfy every one of the other four selection criteria , and which have absolute @xmath28 magnitudes up to one magnitude fainter than the cutoff magnitude .",
    "we then searched the literature for more accurate @xmath28 magnitudes @xmath29 and calculated new values of @xmath30 ( we assume @xmath31 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 and @xmath32 throughout this paper ) using @xmath33 log@xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the luminosity distance , @xmath36 log @xmath37 is the @xmath38 correction ( where we assume @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 is the galactic extinction , as given by @xcite .    with the corrected values of @xmath30 ,",
    "there are only two objects in the pool that are fainter than , but within one magnitude of , the cutoff magnitude ( @xmath13 ) for our sample : mrk509 , which is highly variable , but has an estimated @xmath41 ( @xmath28 magnitude from @xcite ) and mrk231 , also with @xmath41 ( @xmath28 magnitude from @xcite ) .",
    "there is much evidence indicating that the nucleus of mrk231 is heavily reddened , with more than 2 magnitudes of extinction in b ( cs00b and references therein ) . in contrast",
    ", no evidence has been found for nuclear extinction in mrk509 . in particular , in a spectropolarimetric study of seyfert 1 galaxies , @xcite find that there is ample evidence that the nuclear light of mrk231 is reddened and that the inferred scattering is from dust , while the weaker polarization in mrk509 is more likely due to electron scattering , and there is no evidence for nuclear reddening .",
    "therefore we have chosen to include mrk231 in our sample since , except for the reddening , it would squarely fit in our sample .",
    "however , as mrk231 does not formally qualify as a bona fide qso , it may be appropriate to leave it out in some analyses of the sample as a whole .",

    "our ground - based optical and near - ir images , as well as the _ hst _ wfpc2 images ( fig .",

    "the tail appears redder than the host galaxy in the @xmath66 image ( fig .",

    "the tail shows , however , several blue clumps , possibly regions of star formation like those seen in the tidal tails of nearby merging galaxies and of 3c48 ( cs00a ) and mrk1014 ( cs00b ) .",
    "a plausible second tail is visible in the _ hst _ wfpc2 image as well .",
    "this tail extends for @xmath76 from the northwest of the qso ( including the clumps described above ) and arches towards the west and southeast , staying close to the host galaxy , and ending in the faint extension southeast of the region .",
    "this faint extension has a much higher approaching velocity ( @xmath77 km s@xmath15 ) than that of the adjacent brighter region closer to the qso ( @xmath78 km s@xmath15 ) with respect to the central and north regions of the host galaxy .",
    "it appears then that the putative second tail has a high inclination angle with respect to the plane of the sky , and that the system has some rotation about an axis perpendicular to the bright linear feature in the host .",
    "this linear feature , which is also evident in near - ir images , may indicate that the main body of the host galaxy is also seen at a high inclination .",
    "thus , the host galaxy of iras00275@xmath92859 appears to be in the late stages of a merger of two disk galaxies .",

    "we obtain an age of 128 ( + 100 , @xmath964 ) myr for the starburst population , which contributes @xmath80% of the total luminous mass along the line of sight .",
    "it has been found that different individual star forming knots within any given collisional ring galaxy have virtually no spread in ages @xcite , which is to be expected if the star formation was triggered by the propagation of a radial density wave at the time of collision @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect the age determined from the integrated spectrum of the companion to iras04505@xmath92958 to be fairly representative of the starburst activity in the companion .",
    "the companion galaxy is clearly visible in our high resolution @xmath7-band image ( fig .",

    ", we obtain @xmath85 myr , which is less than the starburst age .",
    "the difference between these ages is similar to that of pg1700 + 518 , where the dominant post - starburst population has an age of 85 myr , but the dynamical age of the tail of the companion ( estimated using similar assumptions ) is only @xmath75 myr .",
    "this lends additional support to the suggestion by @xcite that these two systems have undergone very similar interactions , both with small impact parameters .      the radio - quiet qso pg1543 + 489 ( fig",

    "they note that while the _ iue _ spectrum of pg1543 + 489 @xcite has very poor signal - to - noise , it appears somewhat absorbed , so that it remains possible that this object may be a bal qso @xcite .",

    "this age is highly uncertain since we have used very rough and simple assumptions to correct for reddening , and we also note that the model clearly diverges from the observed spectrum at short wavelengths .",
    "however , it is clear that the companion galaxy has a post - starburst spectrum , and the weakness of the , g - band , and @xmath90 features indicates that its age can not be much greater than @xmath44200 myr .",
    "we have a very faint spectrum of the southwest edge of the host galaxy of pg1543 + 489 .",

    "the small projected distance and relative velocities between the qso and the companion , the bridge connecting both objects , and the dominant post - starburst population in the companion galaxy ( and possibly in the qso host ) are all indicative of a strong interaction between these two objects .",
    "the companion galaxy appears as a very compact object ( @xmath91 1.7 kpc ) in our 035 seeing near ir images .",
    "what we are seeing is perhaps the tidally stripped core of the interacting galaxy like those proposed by @xcite . even without correcting for extinction ,",

    "the spectrum shows strong emission lines superposed on a stellar continuum .",
    "we measured line flux ratios from lines that are close in wavelength ( hence fairly insensitive to reddening ; @xcite ) and found that they are consistent with emission coming from regions .",
    "as in the case of the companion to pg1543 + 489 , the steep balmer decrement indicates extinction from dust along the line of sight . using the assumptions described in  [ pg1543sec ] , we corrected for extinction and subtracted emission lines .",

    "for each property , we will provide some background , and describe and discuss our results . in  [ together ] we will put all things together and propose scenarios that incorporate all of our results ; we will also consider the question of evolution .",
    "we have found that 8 out of 9 objects in the sample have unambiguous tidal interaction - induced post - starburst populations .",
    "of the seven objects that show tidal tails , we find knots of star formation along the tails , as predicted by numerical simulations , in at least four cases , and perhaps six .",
    "we also find enhanced star forming activity in the leading edges of the tails of two of the objects .",
    "regions of star formation are found throughout the host galaxies and , at least in the 5 cases where we have high spatial resolution , the strongest and youngest starbursts are invariably concentrated towards the center of the host galaxy , clearly indicating the concentration of material towards the nucleus expected in mergers .    as discussed in detail in cs00b ,",
    "this concentration of material towards the nucleus is likely to have triggered the central strong starbursts and the qso activity roughly simultaneously , but we are unable to observe these initial central starbursts because they are hidden both by the bright qso nucleus and by possible more recent starburst activity .",
    "we have chosen to use a `` peak '' starburst age ( column 5 in table  [ datable ] ) as a measure of the age of the qso activity .",
    "this peak age is the age at which we find evidence for strongest starburst activity in a given host galaxy , but this is somewhat subjective . as we have seen , there is an unavoidable uncertainty in using starburst ages to place qsos in an time sequence .",
    "this is aggravated in our sample by the fact that we have such a small range of starburst ( as well as dynamical ) ages in the host galaxies .",
    "take the case of mrk231 ( see cs00b ) : did the onset of the qso activity occur @xmath44300 myr ago , when the first starbursts were ignited , or was it more recently , less than 5 myr ago , the time when the star formation in the large hii region to the south and possibly in the knots near the nucleus started ? if we are to take the range of starburst ages in a given host galaxy ( column 6 in table  [ datable ] ) as the uncertainty in the age of the qso activity , then this uncertainty is almost as large , in some cases , as the difference in ages between the oldest and the youngest of the nine objects .    while the starburst ages may not accurately pinpoint the age of the qso activity , they are fairly representative of it .",
    "simple arguments can show that the age of the qso activity can be neither much younger nor much older than the starburst ages .",
    "as we have seen , the starburst ages are consistent with having been induced by the evident tidal interactions .",
    "to say that the starbursts came much later than the qso activity is then to say that galaxies already hosting qsos were involved in major mergers that resulted in unusual levels of star forming activity . while this may very well be possible , it is certainly _ not probable _ , as we will see in detail in  [ chance ] . on the other end , we know that starbursts did not come much earlier than the qso activity , since the starburst ages are already so young .",
    "we have 5 confirmed major mergers in our sample , and three additional cases of strong interactions between galaxies of comparable size which are likely to merge in the near future . only in one case",
    "do we have a possible ongoing minor merger , _",
    "i.e. , _  an accretion of a low - mass companion by the host galaxy .",
    "thus , major mergers are the most common triggering mechanism for the qsos in our sample .",
    "similarly , the presence of tidal tails in at least 7 of the objects in the sample implies that disk galaxies are often involved in these mergers .",
    "whether the parent population of the qso hosts themselves are usually disk galaxies is less certain .",
    "clearly some are , since at least 3 of our sample show double tails , and i zw 1 is definitely a spiral .    in terms of merger stage",
    ", we have 2 main groups : ( 1 ) objects whose nuclei have already merged , and ( 2 ) objects where the interacting galaxies are still distinct ( column 7 of table [ datable ] ) . by comparing the peak and range of starburst ages to the dynamical age of each of these objects ,",
    "we find a distinction between the two groups : except for mrk231 , every object in group 1 has starburst ages that are younger than their dynamical ages , while those of group 2 are older than their corresponding dynamical ages .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that objects in group 1 had some mechanism ( possibly a significant bulge in at least one of the galaxies ; @xcite ) to stabilize the gas against early dissipation , whereas objects in group 2 lacked this mechanism .",
    "the range of ages in mrk231 may indicate that this object was initially like those of group 2 , but that we are seeing it at a time when the galaxies have already merged .",
    "the fact that we do not see any pre - merger systems ( group 2 ) where the tidal tails precede the starburst activity in the hosts suggests that the strong peak starburst activity and the ignition of the qsos in objects that do have a stabilizing mechanism is delayed until the later stages of the merger , in agreement with numerical models @xcite ) . the fact that we see qso activity in both groups is further evidence that the age of the qso activity is more closely tied in with the starburst ages than with the morphology of the merger .",
    "it is clear , however , that the force of these conclusions is limited by the size of our sample and by the large uncertainties in the dynamical ages .",
    "these results unambiguously indicate that we have a population of very young objects , both dynamically and in their stellar populations , and , as discussed above , with recently triggered qso activity as well .",
    "we now need to consider other properties in this context .",
    "we have confirmed the long suspected fact that the kind of fir colors in the objects in our sample are indeed indicative of strong star formation in the host galaxies of qsos .",
    "we have also shown that the star formation is not confined to the central regions , but extends at some level over most of the host galaxies .",
    "these starbursts have been triggered by mergers rather than by the interaction of some kind of outflow from the qso with the surrounding environments , even in the central regions ( at least initially ) .",
    "uligs are defined as galaxies with log@xmath120 , and their most common characteristic is that they are mergers : the merger rate in uligs is thought to be at least @xmath121 ( sanders & mirabel 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "the other common characteristic is the intensified star formation as a result of the merger .",
    "so , an object that has an infrared luminosity log@xmath120 , widespread starbursts , and is a merger , is unambiguously a `` bona fide ulig '' . excluding mrk231 from our sample ( on the grounds that its reddened @xmath28 magnitude disqualifies it as a bona fide qso )",
    ", we have a sample of 8 bona fide qsos , 7 of which are bona fide uligs as well ( see table [ datable ] ) .    if the qso and ulig were two completely unrelated phenomena , what is the probability that both would occur in a given galaxy by chance ? in order to estimate this probability , we consider the space densities ( @xmath122 ) of each of these two types of objects as compared with normal galaxies .",
    "we transform the different luminosity functions ( lf ) to bolometric luminosities to allow for meaningful comparisons between the different sets of objects @xcite . for normal galaxies ,",
    "we obtain a @xmath123 mpc@xmath124 by integrating the schechter lf for bolometric luminosities @xmath125 log(l@xmath126/l@xmath2 ) @xmath127 .",
    "the value log@xmath128 corresponds roughly to @xmath6 if its corresponding @xmath129 is transformed to l@xmath126 using the corrections described by @xcite , and 11.2 is where the lf virtually ends . for uligs",

    "finally , we use the lf for qsos given by @xcite in the range 11.2 @xmath91 log(@xmath133 ) @xmath91 13.3 ( roughly equivalent to @xmath922.1 @xmath136 ) and obtain a @xmath137 mpc@xmath124 .",
    "thus , the fractions for uligs and qsos are , respectively , @xmath138 and @xmath139 . using these values , the probability that both phenomena will occur by chance in any",
    "given otherwise normal galaxy is @xmath140 .",
    "we now consider the expected number of galaxies that show both phenomena by chance in the integrated comoving volume out to @xmath130 .",
    "following @xcite , the integrated comoving volume , @xmath141 , from the present to a redshift @xmath142 for an einstein  de sitter universe is simply given by @xmath143 or @xmath144 mpc@xmath145 for @xmath130 and @xmath31 .",
    "we then expect @xmath146 galaxies to be both uligs and qsos by chance .",
    "in contrast , we have at least 7 such objects in this volume .",
    "all of this is to say that the presence of both phenomena in one galaxy must necessarily be physically related . by presenting a sample of 8 bona fide qsos , 7",
    "of which are also bona fide uligs , we are firmly establishing the connection between the two phenomena , at least in the objects in our sample .",
    "moreover , the commonly held view that qsos are fueled in strong tidal interactions has up until now been mostly based on circumstantial evidence .",
    "here we have firmly established that at least some qsos can be traced back to a merger and an ultraluminous infrared phase .",
    "one of the initial goals of this project was to put the transition objects on an age sequence . in an evolutionary scenario where objects move slowly across the fir diagram",
    ", we would have expected those objects with younger ages to be closer to the ulig region , and those with older ages closer to the qso region .    in figs .",

    "the ratio f(25)/f(60 ) has been commonly used to isolate candidate objects in searches for active galactic nuclei .",
    "@xcite note that while the flux at 60 @xmath4 m is in many cases strongly affected by cool emission from star - forming regions outside the active nucleus , the flux at 25 @xmath4 m `` can be even more strongly influenced by activity in the nucleus and serves as an indicator of either warm dust heated by an intense radiation field or nonthermal emission . ''",
    "the second parameter we use ( fig .",
    "[ distplot]@xmath90 ) includes both color indices , and has the form @xmath148 , where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the indices @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "the constants @xmath90 and @xmath153 are chosen in such a way that @xmath154 will measure the perpendicular distance to the line that indicates black - body ( thermal ) radiation in the fir diagram .",
    "[ sampleplot ] ) .",
    "it is no surprise that no clear correlation is found in either one of the plots .",
    "as discussed above , the transition objects have a rather small range in starburst ages . considering the uncertainties in age determination , in the precise relation between starburst age and time elapsed since qso ignition , and in the timescales for buried qsos to become visible ( see below )",
    ", we do not expect to find a clear correlation between age and fir colors in our sample even for the case where evolution uniquely determines the fir colors of the objects .",
    "the fact that the ages for all the transition objects are so young and span such a small range is , however , an important result in itself .",
    "the interpretation of this result depends on the relative time scales of the different physical phenomena in these objects .",
    "consider two extreme scenarios :    \\(1 ) no evolution in the fir diagram : the ulig phase outlives the qso phase , so that the qsos in our sample are born in their current position and spend their entire lives there . in this scenario ,",
    "the small range of starburst ages would indicate that the lifetime of a qso is very short , _",
    "@xmath155 myr .",
    "\\(2 ) evolution in the fir diagram : the qso phase is longer than the ulig phase .",
    "the qsos in our sample were born in the ulig region of the diagram , are now in transition , and will eventually end up in the classical qso region . in this scenario , our results indicate that the transition stage is very short , _",
    "@xmath155 myr .",
    "a third possibility , one where objects move from the classical qso region to the transition region ( _ i.e. , _  galaxies initially hosting qsos undergo major mergers and become uligs as well ) has been dismissed in  [ chance ] . in  [ together ] we will discuss whether our results support either one of the two scenarios proposed above , and in  [ further ] we will propose additional observations that can help discriminate between the two of them .",
    "two points are worth noting regarding [ ] emission in the transition objects .",
    "first , there is a high incidence of [ ] -weak objects in our sample ( 5 out of 9 ) , _",
    "i.e. , _  objects whose rew@xmath115 } < 5 $ ]  .",
    "[ ] -weak qsos are uncommon in samples of radio - quiet qsos ( _ e.g. , _  @xmath156 in @xcite , or @xmath157 in @xcite ) , and even less common in samples of radio - loud quasars ( _ e.g. , _  only 1 out of 45 in @xcite , or 1 out of 58 in @xcite ) .",
    "second , there is a known correlation between the presence of strong extended emission and strong nuclear narrow - line emission in qsos @xcite .",
    "the two transition objects that show strong extended emission , mrk1014 and 3c48 , also show the strongest nuclear emission .",
    "we will refer back to these two points in the following sections .",
    "bal qsos are relatively rare , comprising only about 12% of all radio - quiet qsos in current magnitude limited samples .",
    "the broad , blueshifted troughs in the spectra of bal qsos are indicative of high velocity ( up to @xmath44 0.1 c ) outflows .",
    "although bal qsos may form a class independent from non - bal qsos , the close similarity in emission lines and continuum properties in these two kinds of objects would seem to indicate that they are physically the same kind of object .",
    "therefore the small fraction of bal qsos most likely indicates either a small covering factor of the absorbing material ( so that every qso has a bal region that covers only about 10% of the solid angle subtended at the effective continuum source ) , or a short - lived phase in the life of a qso ( see _ e.g. , _  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an even rarer class comprising only @xmath158 of all radio - quiet qsos in optically - selected samples is that of low - ionization bal qsos ( hereafter lo - bal qsos ) , which show absorption from low - ionization ionic species such as , , , and .",
    "these objects can not generally be explained by simple orientation effects since their properties show significant departures from those of non - bal qsos : they have stronger emission from and possibly , weaker ] , lyman @xmath159 , and emission lines , and are substantially redder than non - bal qsos shortward of 2200   @xcite .",
    "thus lo - bal qsos are thought to constitute a different class of radio - quiet qsos , having more absorbing material and more dust @xcite .",
    "six out of the nine objects in our sample have published uv spectra with enough signal to noise to determine whether they are lo - bal qsos @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that three of these objects ( iras07598 + 6508 , mrk231 , and pg1700 + 518 ) are lo - bal qsos . given an intrinsic probability of 0.015 , the probability that at least 3 out of the 6 objects with good uv spectra are lo - bal qsos by chance is @xmath160 .",
    "however , considering that the nuclear continuum of lo - bal qsos is reddened , their fraction could be significantly underestimated in optically - selected samples .",
    "@xcite estimate that lo - bal qsos may be under - represented in optically selected samples by about an order of magnitude , so that their fraction is more like 0.15 .",
    "this would also at least partially account for the high incidence of lo - bal qsos in warm _ iras _ selected objects previously noticed by @xcite and which we also see in our sample . using this corrected fraction , the a priori probability discussed above raises to 0.05 .",
    "we have searched the literature for additional cases of lo - bal qsos at low redshift . @xcite",
    "have compiled a catalog that includes nearly every known bal qso . from their catalog , as well as the lists of bal qsos published by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we find 19 bal qsos with @xmath161 and @xmath162 ; four of those are confirmed lo - bal qsos , including iras07598 + 6508 , pg1700 + 518 , and mrk231 .",
    "( the recently discovered class of radio - loud bal quasars does not yet include any objects with @xmath161 ; m. s. brotherton , private communication ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , to the best of our knowledge , our sample contains _ three of the four confirmed lo - bal qsos _ that fall in our redshift bin and declination range .",
    "the fourth lo - bal qso is iras14026 + 4341 ( @xmath163 , m@xmath164 ) , which shows weaker absorptions similar to those of mrk231 ( d. c. hines , private communication ) .",
    "although not part of our sample , this object appears to be closely related to the objects in our sample .",
    "[ sampleplot ] shows that iras14026 + 4341 has a position in the fir diagram fairly close to the ( relatively arbitrary ) limits of our sample .",
    "its fir index @xmath159(60 , 25 ) is well within the range of our sample , while @xmath159(100 , 60 ) is less than 1@xmath165 from our limits .",
    "in addition , _ hst _ wfpc2 archival images show that this object has an extended tail and an interacting companion or large starburst region 25 ( 9.6 kpc ) away from the qso nucleus .",
    "finally , the nuclear spectrum of this object shows no [ ] emission @xcite and strong emission ( /h@xmath166 ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it appears that , at least for this small sample of lo - bal qsos , all the objects have very similar fir and optical properties .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have noted a correlation between weak nuclear [ ] emission ( equivalent widths less than 5  ) and the presence of low - ionization absorption troughs in qsos . we have found this tendency in our sample as well . of the six objects observed in the uv , the three that are lo - bal qsos are also [ ] -weak qsos with rew@xmath115 } \\leq 2 $ ]  , whereas the three objects that are not bal qsos have rew@xmath115 } \\geq 20 $ ]   ( see table  [ datable ] ) .",
    "we also confirm the previously noticed tendency for these objects to show strong , which will be discussed further in the following section .",
    "thus , our observations confirm trends noted before . to these we add the following , for at least the small sample of 4 low - redshift lo - bal qsos :",
    "( 1 ) they have a small range in fir colors , ( 2 ) all four objects have strong signs of tidal interaction ( likely major mergers ) , ( 3 ) at least the three objects in our sample show interaction - induced enhanced star formation , with post - starburst ages @xmath155 myr",
    ".    our results then support those interpretations of the lo - bal phenomenon which imply young systems , either in the form of young qsos `` in the act of casting off their cocoons of gas and dust '' ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) , or as the result of outflows driven by supermassive starbursts @xcite .",
    "we will return to this point in  [ together ] .",
    "it would be of interest to investigate further the possibility that lo - bal qsos are exclusively associated with young systems by carrying out spectroscopic and high resolution imaging observations of the host galaxies of larger samples of lo - bal qsos . currently , there are no other studies on the stellar populations of the host galaxies of lo - bal qsos . in @xcite",
    "we have described a @xmath167 bal qso that may be low - ionization ( but this needs to be confirmed spectroscopically ) .",
    "the host galaxy shows some asymmetry , and a crude estimation of the age of the stellar populations in the host galaxy from colors yields @xmath168 myr . if we can firmly establish that the lo - bal phenomenon represents a short phase in the early life of qsos and place limits on the duration of this phase , we could potentially place limits on the mean lifetime of the qso activity . to this end",
    ", it would be necessary to also establish what fraction of qsos go through a lo - bal phase , and an accurate , unbiased value for the total fraction of lo - bal qsos . as a numerical example , our current results would indicate that the mean lifetime of qsos is about 300 myr @xmath169 gyr , where 0.15 is the fraction of lo - bal qsos ( including the correction factor of @xcite ) , and 0.5 is the fraction of the objects in our sample that undergo a bal phase ( assuming that the homogeneous ages in the sample indicate that the non - lo - bal qsos never went through a lo - bal phase ; we will see in  [ together ] that this may not be the case ) .",
    "this is , once again , only an example , as our very small number statistics and the remaining unknowns prevent us from taking this estimate very seriously .",
    "although the emission in agns has been extensively studied ( @xcite and references therein ) , its origin and nature are still poorly understood .",
    "the orthodox view is that the emission and other low - ionization broad lines ( such as @xmath1702798 ) are produced in high density , high optical - depth regions of broad - line clouds , but current photoionization models do not explain the large /h@xmath53 ratios observed in some agns .",
    "the nuclear spectrum of every object in our sample shows emission . with the exception of iras04505@xmath92958 , which has a ratio of @xmath117/h@xmath171 ,",
    "every object is either a strong or extreme emitter according to the definition given in  [ agesum ] .",
    "such high ratios are relatively rare in qsos , with less than 20% of both radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos being strong emitters ( _ e.g. , _  @xcite ) .",
    "only a handful of low - redshift qsos with extreme emission are known ( lpari 1994 ) , and two of them ( iras07598 + 6508 and mrk231 ) are part of our sample ( lpari lists izw1 as an extreme emitter as well ; however , it is unclear how he obtained such a high ratio ) .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the objects in our sample have a common characteristic which enables the production of strong emission .    in  [ samplesec ]",
    "we described an evolutionary sequence proposed by @xcite connecting the strength of the emission with the time elapsed since a major starburst .",
    "we find no clear correlation between @xmath117/h@xmath53 and starburst peak age ( fig .",
    "[ feiiplot ] ) .",
    "once again , this is not surprising given the small range and relatively large uncertainties in the ages .",
    "while we do not clearly see the trend suggested by lpari , we do find that the extreme emitters are among the youngest objects in our sample , and that all of the objects have undergone recent starbursts .",
    "thus , our results could , in principle , fit with lpari s and terlevich et al.s ( 1992 ) suggestion that the emission arises principally in superwind generated by the starbursts .",
    "one problem with this model is , however , that such a wind would presumably have to produce the velocities characteristic of the apparent widths of the lines , typically 20003000 km s@xmath15 , considerably higher than well - documented superwinds .",
    "a different trend which is evident in fig.[feiiplot ] is that [ ] objects ( triangles ) have weaker emission .",
    "this inverse correlation was initially found by @xcite in low - redshift , radio - quiet qsos , and it has been confirmed in samples of both radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos at low , intermediate , and high redshift ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "thus , the objects in our sample are able to produce strong emission even when [ ] emission is present .",
    "the predominant qso properties observed in the sample , such as strong , lo - bal troughs , and weak [ ] emission , all imply a low ionization parameter .",
    "trends indicate also that , at some level , we have two distinct populations : objects with strong [ ] @xmath174 emission , and those with weak or no [ ] emission",
    ". there are at least two instances in which qso spectra can show no [ ] emission : if the upper level of the [ ] lines is collisionally de - excited , or if it is shielded from the strong uv continuum .",
    "we now consider a few reasonable models that might account for the observed properties of the objects in the sample .    *",
    "( 1 ) the broad absorption line region ( balr ) is shielding the uv radiation : * @xcite point out that the correlation between very weak [ ] and the presence of lo - bals strongly suggests that the balr has a large covering factor ( close to 1 ) , preventing much of the ionizing radiation from reaching the low density gas farther away from the qso nucleus where the [ ] emission is produced .",
    "if the balr has a high physical density as proposed by @xcite and @xcite , then the excess may arise in the bal clouds themselves @xcite .",
    "this model would be consistent with the young ages found in our sample if the lo - bal phenomenon indeed represents a phase in the early life of qsos and it would also account for the observed relation between nuclear and extended  [ ] .",
    "a problem with this model is , however , that there is a large fraction of objects having weak [ ] and strong ( or moderately strong ) that do not have bal spectra ,",
    "_ e.g. , _  only 6 out of 18 [ ] -weak objects are bal qsos in the study by @xcite , or only 1 out of 10 in the study by @xcite .",
    "if one takes this model to be the only mechanism responsible for producing the rare class of [ ] -weak objects , then these numbers imply a small covering factor for the balr , and this is at odds with the original premise of this model ( _ i.e. , _  correlation of weak [ ] and bals ) .",
    "a second problem with this model is that it does not explain the excess in the strong [ ] emitters in our sample , _",
    "i.e. , _  those objects where the uv radiation would not be almost completely obscured by the balr .    *",
    "( 2 ) dusty torus model : * an obscuring torus of dense , low - ionization gas and possibly dust surrounding the nucleus was first proposed by @xcite to explain the nature of ( both high- and low - ionization ) bal qsos .",
    "bal clouds are ablated from the surface of the torus and accelerated by thermal wind and radiation pressure , and we view objects as bal qsos when the high - velocity outflow lies along the line of sight ( _ i.e.,_when the torus is seen at high inclination relative to the line of sight ) ; lo - bal qsos are then qsos seen along the most absorbed and dusty lines of sight @xcite .",
    "this model has been very successful at explaining the polarimetric properties of both classes of bal qsos ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as systems seen near edge - on are expected to be more highly polarized than those seen face - on .",
    "using this model , @xcite have formed an orientation sequence for a sample of low - redshift fir - loud objects which includes 7 of the objects in our sample ( with only 3c48 and pg1543 + 489 missing from their sample ) . in this sequence ,",
    "the highly polarized hyperluminous infrared galaxies are those qsos where the torus is seen edge on .",
    "as the inclination angle decreases , while the polarization is still very high , a reddened qso becomes visible and the bal clouds ( which are the `` skin '' of the torus ) come into the line of sight . at even lower inclinations , as the torus is seen nearly face - on , the qso is unobscured and the amount of polarization drops .",
    "mrk1014 and iras04505@xmath92958 are included in the latter class , while the other 5 objects in common with our sample are included in the intermediate class ( dust torus seen at high inclination ) .",
    "@xcite note that this sequence could be explained instead by decreasing dust content , but argue that the @xmath175 of the reddened objects does not appear to be enhanced with respect to that of the pg qsos when corrected for line - of - sight reddening .",
    "the correlation with strong and weak [ ] emission is not as obvious in this orientation - dependent model .",
    "a possibility suggested by d. c. hines ( @xcite , comment during question period ) is that the gas may not be physically associated with the torus , but rather lie closer to the central source in dense , matter dominated blobs .",
    "while the side of each blob facing the central engine would be highly ionized , the side facing away from it and towards the torus would be less ionized and could give rise to emission , which could naturally be seen more easily in systems closer to edge - on . in order to explain an orientation dependent [",
    "] , however , anisotropic [ ] emission is required .",
    "@xcite argue that , unlike the case of the [ oii ] @xmath63 line , the relatively higher ionization potential and critical density of the [ ] @xmath114 line would allow for a major contribution to its integrated luminosity to come from nuclear regions on a scale not much larger than the broad line region ( blr ) . then the [ ] emission could be partially obscured by the dust torus when seen from a range of inclinations .",
    "he s et al .",
    "point out that if this were the case , part of the emission may show up weakly in the reflected polarized spectrum , but this has not been observed in any of the polarimetry studies of lo - bal qsos ( see also @xcite for an argument against obscured [ ] emission ) . even assuming an obscured [ ] emission , the correlation between nuclear and extended emission",
    "is not explained , neither is the enhanced emission in the three objects that are supposedly seen near face on .",
    "in addition , the radio properties of lo - bal qsos seem to pose a problem to this model . @xcite argue that no preferred viewing orientation is necessary to observe bal systems in the spectra of quasars since gregg et al .  and",
    "@xcite observe bals in both flat and steep spectrum quasars , _",
    "i.e. , _  objects that are presumably viewed along the jet axis and at high inclination respectively ( see also @xcite ) . finally , the youth in the transition objects would be fortuitous in this model .    *",
    "( 3 ) unusually high densities in the balr : * @xcite propose an alternate model for lo - bal qsos where only the objects falling at the very high end of the column - density distribution of bal qsos develop low - ionization absorption and associated emission .",
    "the balr is taken to be hospitable to dust , which would explain the observed fir emission and the reddened spectra of these objects .",
    "the covering factor is estimated to be 25%30% .",
    "this model then predicts that for every lo - bal qso there should be two or three non - bal qsos with comparable ir colors , which is precisely what we see in our sample ( assuming the three objects that have not been observed in the uv are not lo - bal qsos ) .",
    "while the weak nuclear [ ] is not explicitly accounted for in this model , one might imagine a scenario where the high density in the bal clouds is able to collisionally de - excite the upper level of [ ] .",
    "however , the model does not explain the absence of extended [ ] emission in the majority of the objects in the sample in spite of the fact that all of them are quite likely to have extended gas leftover from the tidal interaction .",
    "in addition , there is no clear connection between the model and the youth of the objects in our sample .    *",
    "( 4 ) cocoon - like dust surrounds the nuclear regions of the qso : * we have alluded to several lines of evidence supporting the presence of large amounts of dust in the nuclear regions of the transition qsos ( scc98 , cs00a , b ,  [ chap5 ] ) . here",
    "we present a model where a dust cocoon is shielding the nlr from the ionizing radiation coming from the central continuum source .",
    "the resulting low - ionization parameter and the dusty environment would allow strong emission to arise , while the absence of extended [ ] emission would be explained by the inability of the ionizing photons to reach the extended gas .",
    "the lo - bal phenomenon would then be interpreted as more widespread outflows , and , as proposed by @xcite , `` a manifestation of the [ qso s ] efforts to expel a thick shroud of gas and dust '' . in this model ,",
    "strong [ ] objects are more evolved , having undergone the lo - bal phase already , and having thus poked some holes through the dusty cocoon .",
    "ionizing photons are then able to reach the nlr through the holes , and also to ionize some of the extended gas .",
    "the idea of an ionizing continuum being able to reach the extended gas only along some lines of sight is supported by the patchy morphology of the extended region in 3c48 and mrk1014 ( @xcite ; cs00a , b ) and the fact that much of the gas in their host galaxies is not ionized .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the three strong [ ] objects are less reddened or obscured than the rest of the objects in the sample .",
    "however , even at this stage , much of the dust is still present in nuclear regions ( see , _",
    "@xcite and @xcite for dust contents in 3c48 ) , so that emission , while less efficiently than in previous stages , is still able to form .",
    "the idea of a cocoon with holes may also explain the different lightpaths in bal qsos inferred from polarimetric studies , where some continuum is seen to escape without passing through dust ( _ e.g. , _  iras07598 + 6508 : @xcite ) .",
    "a problem with this model is that it is not clear whether a dust cocoon alone would be able to completely suppress the [ ] emission in the majority of the transition objects while at the same time allowing the broad emission lines to be visible , without having to place stringent constraints on allowed dust grain sizes .",
    "other mechanisms which thrive in dusty environments may need to be invoked .",
    "for example , @xcite propose an explanation for the strong weak [ ] correlation where a dusty low - ionization blr ( more specifically , dense , high - speed , -emitting clouds ) cover the ionizing continuum , thereby simultaneously increasing the emission and shielding the lower - density , more distant gas where the [ ] emission is produced .",
    "finally , the youth in 3c48 implied by its stellar populations pose a problem if 3c48 is to be considered a more evolved object .",
    "it is possible that , being a very powerful object as implied by its very powerful radio source , 3c48 was able to break through parts of the dust cocoon more rapidly than other objects . this may , in fact , be the reason why lo - bal qsos are seemingly more rare among radio - loud sources , and so far only one out of 30 + known radio - loud bal quasars has been found to have very strong radio emission @xcite .    while some of these models may be quite appropriate for classical qsos , the results presented in this paper imply that a model describing transition qsos must necessarily account for the young ages of these systems . in principle , each of these models could be modified to account for the youth in these systems if , for example , the dusty torus described in ( 2 ) was preferentially found in young systems , or the unusually high densities of ( 3 ) were a direct result of a violent tidal interaction . for the time",
    "being , however , we favor ( 4 ) as the working model simply because it accounts for all the observed properties and , in particular , it is a direct consequence of the youth in the systems .    we are now ready to present a cartoon picture of our proposed model : some major mergers between galaxies of similar mass , often disk galaxies , trigger intense bursts of star formation .",
    "as the gas concentrates in nuclear regions , the qso activity is ignited .",
    "both the starburst and qso activity start before the galaxies merge if both galaxies lack a substantial bulge , or near the final merger if at least one does have a bulge . along with gas , dust",
    "is concentrated in the central 1 or 2 kpc , resulting in a dust enshrouded qso .",
    "both the agn and the starburst heat the dust and the object is observed as a ulig .",
    "a lo - bal phase comes next when the qso casts off its cocoon .",
    "while we are already able to see the qso , much of the dust cocoon is still shielding the ionizing uv radiation , so that is able to survive and oxygen is not doubly ionized in the nlr or extended gas . as the ionizing photons are able to escape along some lines of sight , nuclear and extended [ ] appear .",
    "powerful qsos , especially powerful radio sources , are able to break through the dust cocoon more rapidly , and this is the reason why we do not see many strong radio - loud quasars in cocoon phase .",
    "the entire process does not last very long ; transition qsos either evolve into classical qsos or die within a few hundred myr .    in this scenario ,",
    "our results indicate that we are able to see the radio - quiet qsos @xmath176 myr after the peak of the starburst activity .",
    "this remarkably short time may appear , at first , to be at odds with the idea that uligs evolve to become qsos , since some uligs have been observed to have starburst ages @xmath177 300 myr ( @xcite ) . however , on the one hand there must be a dispersion in the properties of uligs that govern the time it takes for dust to be cleared from the inner regions . on the other hand , as mentioned in cs00a , and in agreement with the scenario proposed above , there is almost certainly a range of lines of sight in each transition object for which the qso is hidden and the object is viewed solely as a ulig . in the same way , one might expect that some of the objects that we observe solely as uligs are seen as qsos along some lines of sight .",
    "the overlap in ages is then not only consistent , but also expected in the proposed scenario .",
    "one might also expect that some of the latter proposed objects ( _ i.e. , _  hidden qsos residing in uligs ) have already poked holes not along our line of sight and are able to ionize the extended gas . therefore , narrow - band imaging ( centered around observed - frame [ ] ) of uligs may show in some objects extended emission line regions analogous to those of 3c48 or mrk1014 ( canalizo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . indeed , the ulig iras09104 + 4109 ( @xmath178 , log@xmath179 ) , which shows a hidden qso spectrum in polarized , scattered light @xcite , also shows extended [ ] emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the ionized gas is tidal debris , as is likely the case in the two transition objects in our sample with strong extended [ ] @xcite .",
    "along similar lines , by considering the properties that are common to uligs that unambiguously show hidden broad line regions in polarized light , @xcite find that uligs are most likely to host an obscured qso if they exhibit a high - ionization spectrum characteristic of seyfert 2 galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "incidentally , the newly found `` hidden quasar '' presented by @xcite ( iras17345 + 1124 , @xmath180 , log@xmath181 ) shows optical emission .    the eight objects in the sample that are uligs have very high ir luminosities , namely log @xmath182 .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath183 of uligs with @xmath184 show evidence for nuclear activity , with either seyfert 1 or seyfert 2 spectra ( the latter presumably being hidden qsos ) .",
    "this percentage is likely to be even higher at log @xmath182 ( d. b. sanders , private communication ) .",
    "thus , the objects in the sample may be representative of a large fraction of uligs at high luminosities , and our results could , in principle , be consistent with a scenario where a majority of uligs at these luminosities go through a transition phase .",
    "it is more difficult to estimate what fraction of optically selected qsos might be represented by our sample . @xcite",
    "show the distribution of the ratio @xmath185 for pg qsos ( their fig .",
    "5 ) , having a mean ratio of @xmath186 .",
    "if we assume that the ratio @xmath187 for the sample objects listed in column 4 of table  [ datable ] is representative of the ratio given by sanders et al .",
    "and we scale it using mrk1014 ( which is a member of both the pg sample and our sample ) , then the transition objects in our sample ( excluding mrk231 , which is not a bona fide qso and is obviously heavily reddened ) have a mean ratio of @xmath188 . by comparing the distributions",
    ", we estimate that the transition sample is representative of @xmath189 of the optically selected pg qso sample . taking this number at face value",
    "would imply that a considerable fraction of optically selected qsos do not go through a transition phase , unless the qso activity can last as long as @xmath190 gyr .",
    "however , the ratio of ir to uv luminosities should be treated with caution .",
    "while the fir emission is expected to be emitted isotropically , the flux at uv wavelengths can be significantly depressed with the presence of a screen of dust along the line of sight .",
    "thus this ratio is very likely more indicative of reddening than of intrinsic characteristics in the objects .",
    "finally , a word on radio - loud vs.  radio - quiet qsos . our results do not shed any light on possible relationships or differences between the two classes of objects .",
    "however , these results give no indication that the two classes form differently . of nine objects",
    ", we have one radio - loud qso ( 3c48 ) , which is exactly how many we would expect in a near - complete sample including both kinds of qsos . of the properties we studied in the different objects , all of them were virtually identical in 3c48 and mrk1014 : morphologies , starburst timescales , and nuclear properties .",
    "the newly discovered class of lo - bal quasars of moderate radio luminosity @xcite shows that , in this scenario , radio loud objects can indeed undergo an outflow phase .",
    "the fact that strong emitters are less numerous and [ ] -weak objects are almost non - existent in radio - loud qsos could be explained as a selection effect : extended radio structure indicates to some level that uv radiation has already been able to escape .",
    "this would also explain why emission appears weaker in lobe - dominant radio - loud qsos @xcite .",
    "radio - loud qsos seem to have intrinsically stronger nuclear and extended [ ] emission than radio - quiet qsos ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this may in turn be indicative of a more powerful ionizing radiation that can break through obscuring material more rapidly than radio - quiet qsos . in noticing differences between radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos , @xcite comments : `` the presence of a hot , dusty , environment with low- and high - ionization ( bal ) outflows along the line - of - sight [ in radio - quiet qsos ] therefore has something to do with _ lack _ of powerful radio emission '' . in our model",
    ", the connection would simply be that those systems lacking powerful radio emission take a longer time to get rid of the very dust that is connected with such characteristics .",
    "the model we have presented is by no means complete or unique ; most likely there are elements of each of the different models discussed above which play a role in actual systems .",
    "our intention is simply to lay the foundations for a working model that can be tested with observations and , most importantly , that incorporates the new ingredient we have found in these systems , _",
    "i.e. , _  that they are recently fed agns residing in dynamically young systems with young post - starburst populations .    and now for the question of evolution . in  [ firage ] we stated that the young ages found for the sample objects suggest two possible scenarios : one where objects evolve in the fir diagram and the transition between groups is fast , and the other where objects do not evolve and the qso activity is short lived . after analyzing our results as a whole",
    ", we find no strong evidence that uniquely supports either one of these scenarios . we may be inclined to favor an evolutionary scenario simply because , based on the model we propose , transition objects could evolve naturally into classical qsos if only given enough time . however a conclusive answer will only be reached as we gain knowledge on the relative timescales of the two governing phenomena in these systems . in the following section ,",
    "we describe further observations that may help to settle the question of evolution .",
    "if we could determine the mean lifetimes for the qso and ulig phenomena , the question of evolution vs. no evolution in the fir diagram would be , in principle , unambiguously solved . unfortunately , there are no simple ways to determine these lifetimes . in  [ lobal ]",
    "we proposed a method to estimate the mean lifetime of qsos from observations of lo - bal qsos , but many unknowns need to be solved for before accurate estimates can be obtained , even if the method does turn out to be applicable . for uligs",
    ", we could possibly observe spectroscopically a large sample and set upper limits to the time a galaxy might spend in this phase .",
    "however , the question of whether every ulig harbors an agn is far from settled , and this alone could confuse the results .",
    "a different approach to the problem is to try to find the natural descendants of the transition objects , _",
    "i.e. , _  classical qsos whose host galaxies contain older starburst populations and aging signs of interaction",
    ". we would select a sample of objects with the same selection criteria as the sample in this paper , except that the objects would have a position in the fir color - color diagram farther away from uligs , in the region labeled qso .",
    "these objects are marked by squares in fig .",
    "[ sampleplot ] .",
    "the host galaxies of these objects would then be observed with two main objectives : ( a ) search for and characterize past interaction or merger activity , and ( b ) search for and date aging post - starburst populations .",
    "the presence of merger remnants ( or lack thereof ) would certainly establish the role of mergers and interactions in the triggering of the bulk of the qso population .",
    "the presence of aging starburst populations would imply a starburst - agn connection as in the transition objects .",
    "the combination of both results would conclusively establish the connection between classical and transition qsos , and , therefore , uligs .",
    "finally , results would give a measure for the relative time scales of these various phenomena .",
    "recent _ hst _ imaging of qso host galaxies indicates that at least a large fraction of qsos , both radio - loud and radio - quiet , reside in elliptical hosts @xcite .",
    "if major mergers indeed play a significant role in the origin of the majority of the qso population , it is possible that these elliptical hosts are rather merger remnants @xcite .",
    "if this were the case , one might expect to find fine structure indicative of past interaction and ancient merger events in the host galaxies .",
    "this tell - tale structure , which includes ripples , plumes , tails , and boxy isophotes , is commonly seen in nearby ellipticals ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and indicates that at least some of these early type galaxies were either formed or structurally modified by mergers relatively recently ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    in a study of a large sample of nearby e and s0 galaxies , schweizer and collaborators @xcite used a fine structure index , @xmath191 , to characterize past merger activity .",
    "the index @xmath191 measures four types of fine structure thought to be caused by mergers , and therefore is sensitive to the dynamical age of the merger , and provides a rough measure of the dynamical youth or rejuvenation of the galaxies .",
    "@xcite found an anticorrelation between @xmath191 and x - ray excess in early type galaxies , which indicates that galaxies with high fine - structure content have not had enough time after the merger to form hot halos .",
    "ground - based imaging observations using adaptive optics ( ao ) and space - based imaging observations using the _ hst _ highly sensitive advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) would make it possible to detect such fine structure in the hosts of qsos . the @xmath1921 resolution of such observations is equivalent to 0.4 kpc for objects at @xmath130 , even better than the 0.5 kpc resolution in schweizer & seitzer s study of nearby galaxies .",
    "thus , it is quite possible to apply these techniques to qso host galaxies and characterize past interaction and merger activity in these systems .",
    "as we have seen , spectroscopic observations allow us to date directly the ages of the stellar populations in the host galaxies of qsos .",
    "we can use similar techniques to the ones described in this paper to observe and model the host galaxies of classical qsos .    in order to test the feasibility of detecting older starbursts in host galaxies , we have carried out simulations of different intermediate - age starburst populations superposed on the spectrum of an old elliptical galaxy .",
    "the simulations show that it is possible to detect and identify a starburst population as old as @xmath193 gyr that comprises 10% of the total luminous mass along the line of sight .",
    "the best age indicators are the balmer lines ( h@xmath53 and h@xmath194 in particular ) , the 4000    break , the cn - band , and , for higher - z objects , the slope of the continuum shortwards of 3100  .",
    "the flux of starburst populations older than @xmath195 gyr drops very rapidly with age and it becomes difficult to distinguish between a starburst+elliptical spectrum and the elliptical spectrum itself , unless the mass fraction of the starburst population along the line of sight is significantly higher than 10% .",
    "these constraints give us much room to find the descendants of transition objects .",
    "as we have seen , our results imply that objects move rapidly from the ulig to classical qso population in the evolutionary scenario .",
    "therefore we expect to find descendants ( if any ) with post - starbursts ages ranging from @xmath196 myr to the upper limit of the qso lifetime .",
    "dating such relatively young starbursts should be quite feasible .",
    "as a preview to what we might expect from these observations , we briefly discuss results for one member of the classical qso population , phl909 ( @xmath197 ) , for which analogous observations already exist .",
    "the position of phl909 in the fir diagram is indicated in fig .",
    "[ sampleplot ] by a filled square surrounded by a large open square .",
    "2 of @xcite shows a psf subtracted , _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 image of phl909 through the f606w filter .",
    "bahcall et al .",
    "report that the host is a normal e4 galaxy .",
    "@xcite successfully model the host with an elliptical template in a f675w _ hst _ image , which presumably avoids strong emission lines .",
    "the qso+elliptical - host subtracted image shown in their fig .",
    "a11 has structure in the residuals which , pending careful analysis , may be interpreted as the tell - tale structure described in  [ remnants ] . a 900 s keck lris spectrum of the host galaxy of phl909 ( canalizo & stockton , in preparation ) shows that there is no very young post - starburst component present .",
    "however , this spectrum does not have sufficient s / n to constrain the presence of a significant @xmath198-gyr - old population .",
    "we have studied a sample of transition qsos , _ i.e. , _",
    "bona fide qsos that have far infrared colors intermediate between uligs and qsos . in summary ,",
    "every transition qso shows signs of tidal interaction .",
    "five out of nine are confirmed major mergers and are in the late stages when the nuclei have already merged .",
    "three additional objects have strongly interacting companions with masses comparable to those of the hosts , and are expected to merge soon ( resulting in major mergers as well ) . only one transition qso is undergoing a minor merger .",
    "disk galaxies are often involved in these mergers .",
    "seven objects show clear tidal tails , and one shows a bridge connecting the companion galaxy with the host . of the objects that have not yet merged ,",
    "two are likely to be ring galaxies ( with tidal tails as well ) resulting from near head - on collisions .",
    "every transition qso shows strong recent star - forming activity , and in eight cases this activity is closely related to the tidal interaction .",
    "these eight objects have spectra characteristic of e+a galaxies .",
    "the spectra are successfully modeled by an underlying old population plus a superposed young instantaneous burst population .",
    "we find very young starburst ages for all the objects in our sample , ranging from ongoing star formation to @xmath199 myr .",
    "\\4 . by comparing the starburst ages of the central stellar components with those of the more extended emission",
    ", we have determined the relative ages between stellar populations in various regions of the host galaxies .",
    "these estimates , along with dynamical ages , place constraints on the timescale for concentrating material in the nucleus , which in turn could provide the fuel for the qso .",
    "this is an important step towards understanding the fueling of qsos , and the timescales for their evolution .",
    "seven out of the eight bona fide qsos in the sample are also bona fide uligs .",
    "the probability that both phenomena coexist by chance in any given otherwise normal galaxy if the two are unrelated is @xmath200 .",
    "the expected number of galaxies that show both phenomena by chance in the integrated comoving volume spanned by our sample is @xmath201 galaxies .",
    "our sample firmly establishes the physical connection between the two phenomena in at least one subclass of qsos .",
    "the young ages derived for the transition qsos imply one of two scenarios : ( a ) at least some uligs evolve to become classical qsos , and the transition time between the two is short ( @xmath155 myr ) , or ( b ) at least some qsos are born under the same conditions as uligs and their lifetime as qsos is very short ( @xmath155 myr ) .",
    "we find a high incidence of lo - bal qsos , [ ] -weak qsos , and qsos with strong or extreme emission in our sample .",
    "we confirm previously reported trends in these properties , and our results require that they be interpreted in the context of young systems .",
    "three out of the four known lo - bal qsos with @xmath202 and @xmath203 are part of the sample of transition qsos .",
    "the fourth object has very similar fir colors , a clear tail , and possibly luminous regions of recent star formation .",
    "this indicates that the lo - bal phenomenon is directly related to young systems , and it may represent a short - lived stage in the early life of a large fraction of qsos .",
    "we find evidence indicating that objects with strong [ ] emission and those with weak or no [ ] represent two distinct populations .",
    "the former may be at a more evolved stage in an evolutionary scenario .",
    "we propose a model involving a dust cocoon that initially surrounds the qso nuclear regions , which can account for all the observed and derived properties in transition objects .",
    "this model is at least qualitatively consistent with the idea of young , dust - enshrouded qsos originally proposed by @xcite    at the beginning of this paper , we posed two important questions regarding the transition objects : _ `` where did they come from ? '' _ , and _",
    "`` where will they go ? ''",
    "_ we have answered the first question unambiguously : transition objects are the product of mergers resulting in vigorous star formation and the ignition of qso activity .",
    "transition objects have come from , and are still part of , the ulig population .",
    "we have also narrowed down the answer to the second question to two possibilities : either transition objects will indeed go on to the become part of the classical qso population within a few hundred million years , or they will die within this same amount of time .",
    "in addition , we have outlined observations that can potentially discriminate between the two possibilities .",
    "the final answer to this question will also provide crucial answers regarding the timescales involved in the uligs and qsos .",

    "<S> we test the hypothesis that qsos are formed via strong tidal interactions or mergers , initially going through an ultraluminous infrared phase . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to look for traces to this phase in the host galaxies of qsos . </S>",
    "<S> we select a sample of low - redshift bona fide qsos that may be in a transitionary stage between uligs and qsos . </S>",
    "<S> these objects , which we shall call transition qsos , have an intermediate position in the far infrared color - color diagram between the regions occupied by the two classes of objects . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a systematic spectroscopic and imaging study of these objects in order to determine their interaction and star - forming histories . by modeling the spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain ages for the recent starburst events in the host galaxies and interacting companions . </S>",
    "<S> we have discussed in detail the first 5 objects in the sample in previous publications ; here we present results for the remaining 4 objects , and discuss the sample as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all 9 transition qsos are undergoing tidal interactions and that 8 are major mergers . </S>",
    "<S> every object also shows strong recent star - forming activity , and in at least eight cases this activity is directly related to the tidal interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the ages we derive for the starburst populations range from currently active star formation in some objects , to post - starburst ages @xmath0 myr in others . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a clear connection between interactions , starbursts , and qso activity . </S>",
    "<S> seven of the qsos in the sample are also uligs ; statistical considerations show that the two phenomena are necessarily physically related in these objects . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply one of two scenarios : ( 1 ) at least some uligs evolve to become classical qsos , and the transition stage lasts @xmath0 myr , or ( 2 ) at least some qsos are born under the same conditions as uligs , and their lifetime as qsos lasts @xmath0 myr . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss other properties and trends found in the sample , and propose a model that accounts for all of them , as well as the youth of these systems . </S>"
