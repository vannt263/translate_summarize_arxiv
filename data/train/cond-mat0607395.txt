    "spin - orbit coupling is one of the sources of degradation of spin entanglement that has been extensively investigated for electron pairs confined to two quantum dots.@xcite in that context the spin - orbit coupling induces dephasing by coupling the electron spins via the orbital motion to fluctuating electric fields in the environment ( due to lattice vibrations or gate voltage fluctuations ) . the coupling of the spins to the environment is needed for entanglement degradation because the spin - orbit coupling by itself amounts to a local unitary transformation of the electron states in the two quantum dots , which can not change the degree of entanglement .",
    "the characteristic feature of these quantum dots is that they are single - channel conductors with a conductance @xmath5 that is small compared to the conductance quantum @xmath6 .",
    "this implies in particular that the width of the energy levels is much smaller than the mean level spacing . at low voltages and temperatures",
    "there is then only a single accessible orbital mode .",
    "this is the main reason that spin - orbit coupling by itself can not degrade the spin entanglement .    in a multi - channel conductor",
    "the situation is altogether different .",
    "flying qubits in a multi - channel conductor can lose their entanglement as a result of spin - orbit coupling even in the absence of electric field fluctuations , because the large number of orbital degrees of freedom can play the role of an environment .",
    "this mechanism is the electronic analog of the loss of polarization entanglement by polarization - dependent scattering in quantum optics.@xcite fully - phase - coherent spin - orbit coupling can degrade the spin entanglement by reducing the pure spin state to a mixed spin density matrix  which typically has less entanglement than the pure state .",
    "here we investigate this mechanism in the context of electron - hole entanglement in the fermi sea.@xcite apart from the practical significance for the observability of the entanglement , this study provides a test for a theory of entanglement transfer based on the `` isotropy approximation '' that the spin state has no preferential quantization axis .",
    "the system we consider , a multi - channel conductor containing a tunnel barrier , is schematically depicted in fig .",

    "the applied voltage @xmath7 creates , at each tunnel event , a maximally entangled electron - hole pair.@xcite spin - orbit coupling in the leads entangles the spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the spin state ( obtained by tracing out the orbital degrees of freedom ) is degraded from a pure state to a mixed state .",
    "the degree of entanglement of the spin state decreases and can vanish for strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we consider two cases . in the first case",
    "the leads are diffusive wires while in the second case we model the leads as two chaotic cavities .",
    "although the first case is our primary interest , we include the second case in order to test our approximate analytical calculations against an exact numerical simulation of the spin kicked rotator.@xcite    the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
