    "skew schur polynomials @xmath0 play an important and multi - faceted role in algebraic combinatorics .",
    "for example , they are generating functions for the littlewood - richardson coefficients @xmath1 @xmath2 they are also generating functions for young tableaux of shape @xmath3 @xmath4 where the sum is over all young tableaux @xmath5 of shape @xmath3 and @xmath6 is a monomial associated to @xmath5 .",
    "the relationship between these two very different facets of skew schur polynomials involves the combinatorics of young tableaux  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 , appendix 1 ) .",
    "young tableaux can be thought of as increasing labeled chains in young s lattice , with covers labeled by pairs @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the entry in the box corresponding to the cover , and @xmath9 the content of that box ( that is , the difference between its column and row ) ; labels are ordered lexicographically .",
    "we introduce skew schubert polynomials , which are the schubert polynomial analogs of skew schur polynomials , in the sense that they generalize the two properties mentioned above .    in section 1",
    ", we introduce our key concepts of increasing labeled chains in the bruhat order , which generalize young tableaux , and of skew schubert polynomials , @xmath10 for permutations @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , we show that skew schubert polynomials are generating functions both for littlewood - richardson coefficients @xmath12 for schubert polynomials ( the analog of  ) , and for increasing chains in the bruhat order ( the analog of  ) . our skew schubert polynomials are different from those defined in @xcite ( using skew divided difference operators ) , which do not expand with nonnegative coefficients in the basis of schubert polynomials , in general .",
    "the skew schubert polynomial @xmath13 is the ordinary schubert polynomial @xmath14 , and our formula for @xmath13 in terms of increasing chains is the formula of corollary  5.3 in  @xcite , which inspired us ( see the next section for the notation ) . in section 2",
    ", we give a purely combinatorial proof of that formula , relating it to a standard construction  @xcite in terms of rc - graphs by giving a content - preserving bijection between rc - graphs and increasing chains .",
    "let @xmath15 be the symmetric group of permutations of @xmath16 . for @xmath17 , the _ length _",
    ", @xmath18 , of @xmath19 is the number of inversions of @xmath19 .",
    "set @xmath20 to be the longest permutation , @xmath21 .",
    "we use basics on schubert and schur polynomials , which may be found in any of  @xcite .",
    "the main outstanding problem in the theory of schubert polynomials is the littlewood - richardson problem  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 11 ) : determine the structure constants @xmath12 defined by the polynomial identity @xmath22 since every schur polynomial is a schubert polynomial , this problems asks for the analog of the classical littlewood - richardson rule .",
    "the classical littlewood - richardson coefficients @xmath1 have important and intricate combinatorial properties  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 , appendix 1 ) .",
    "the littlewood - richardson coefficients @xmath12 for schubert polynomials should be similarly important .",
    "indeed , they are intersection numbers of schubert varieties ; more precisely , @xmath12 enumerates flags in a suitable triple intersection of schubert varieties indexed by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the cohomology classes @xmath26 ( called schubert classes ) for @xmath17 of schubert varieties form an integral basis for the cohomology ring @xmath27 of the flag manifold . many identities and some formulas for the constants",
    "@xmath12 have been obtained by studying the class @xmath28 in @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "this is because , for @xmath29 , we have the following identity in the cohomology ring @xmath30 and hence , by the duality of the intersection pairing @xmath31    with this motivation , we would like to define the skew schubert polynomial @xmath10 for permutations @xmath11 in @xmath15 to be _ the _ polynomial representative of the class @xmath28 . unfortunately , the cohomology of the flag manifold is isomorphic to the quotient ring @xmath32/      \\langle e_i(x_1,\\ldots , x_n)\\mid i=1,\\ldots , n\\rangle\\,,\\ ] ] and so there is no well - defined polynomial representative of @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the @xmath34th elementary symmetric polynomial in @xmath35 .",
    "if however we choose the degree reverse lexicographic term order on monomials in the polynomial ring @xmath36 $ ] , with @xmath37 , then every element of this quotient ring has a unique normal form polynomial representative  ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.1 ) with respect to this term order .",
    "these normal form representatives are elements of @xmath38 equivalently , if we set @xmath39 , then normal form representatives of cohomology classes are sums of monomials dividing @xmath40 .",
    "fomin , gelfand , and postnikov  @xcite observed that for @xmath17 , the schubert polynomial @xmath14 is the normal form representative of the corresponding schubert class @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , this feature of schubert polynomials , that one does not need to work modulo an ideal , is what led lascoux and schtzenberger to their definition of schubert polynomial .",

    "the independence of @xmath44 is the familiar stability property of schubert polynomials .",
    "the independence of @xmath45 may be similarly deduced using divided differences .",
    "this also follows from proposition  [ prop : schub - constr ] , which we prove in section 2 .",
    "the skew schubert polynomial @xmath10 is also a generating function for certain chains from @xmath23 to @xmath19 in the bruhat order .",
    "the bruhat order is defined by its covers ; @xmath46 if and only if @xmath47 is a transposition @xmath7 with @xmath48 , and for every @xmath49 we have either @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath52 with @xmath53 if @xmath48 and at no position between @xmath8 and @xmath9 does @xmath23 take a value between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that the difference in lengths @xmath56 equals 1 .",
    "the _ labeled bruhat order _ is the labeled rseau ( labeled directed multigraph ) obtained from the bruhat order by drawing a directed edge @xmath57 whenever @xmath46 with @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we note that all the constructions and statements still hold if we uniformly set @xmath61 , but it is more convenient to use the first definition .",
    "there will be @xmath62 such directed edges for every cover .",
    "this structure was defined in  @xcite and has been crucial in subsequent work on the problem of multiplying schubert polynomials by bergeron and sottile . in  @xcite this structure",
    "was called the colored bruhat order .    to any ( saturated )",
    "chain @xmath63 in this rseau , we associate a monomial @xmath64 in the variables @xmath65 , where the power of @xmath66 counts how often @xmath34 was the first coordinate of a label in @xmath63 .",
    "a chain @xmath67 in this rseau is _ increasing _ if its sequence of labels is increasing in the lexicographic order on pairs of integers .",
    "these definitions allow a nice reformulation of a combinatorial construction of schubert polynomials given in  @xcite .",

    "thus @xmath75 . for @xmath11 in the bruhat order and a composition @xmath74 of @xmath56 , let @xmath76 count the number of increasing chains from @xmath23 to @xmath19 of type @xmath74 . since @xmath77 , equating coefficients in   and using theorem  [ thm : skew ] we obtain    [ cor : identity ] @xmath78 .",

    "[ lem : linear ] for any @xmath92 , @xmath88 is the coefficient of the monomial @xmath93 in the normal form representative of @xmath94 .",

    "first , both @xmath95 and the map associating to @xmath94 the coefficient of the monomial @xmath93 in the normal form representative of @xmath94 are @xmath96-linear maps on @xmath27 .",
    "second , the lemma holds on the basis of schubert classes , whose representatives are schubert polynomials .",
    "this was shown by kirillov and maeno  @xcite and is also a consequence of the pieri formula  @xcite and the construction of schubert polynomials given in proposition  [ prop : schub - constr ] .",
    "given a chain @xmath63 in the bruhat order , let end@xmath97 denote its end point .",
    "the pieri - type formula for schubert classes  @xcite is @xmath98 the sum over all increasing chains that begin at @xmath23 , have length @xmath83 , and whose labels have first coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "applying lemma  [ lem : linear ] to the class @xmath28 shows that the coefficient of the monomial @xmath99 in the normal form representative of @xmath100 is the coefficient of @xmath89 in the triple product @xmath101 , where @xmath74 is the type of the chain @xmath63 .",
    "since the coefficient of @xmath89 in a product @xmath102 is the kronecker delta @xmath103 ( by the duality of the intersection pairing ) , this is the coefficient of @xmath26 in the product @xmath104 .",
    "the theorem now follows by expanding this product and iteratively applying the pieri formula .    by the definition of skew schubert polynomials , we have @xmath105 since @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "thus there should exist a natural bijection between @xmath108 and @xmath109 that preserves type .",
    "corollary  [ cor : identity ] suggests that , for @xmath11 , this bijection should generalize to a map from @xmath110 to the union @xmath111 such that the cardinality of the inverse image of each chain in @xmath112 is @xmath113 .",
    "this would give a combinatorial interpretation for @xmath113 , and thus solve the littlewood - richardson problem .    the skew schubert polynomial @xmath10 also has a geometric interpretation as the representative in cohomology of a skew schubert variety @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the schubert variety whose representative in cohomology is @xmath14 and @xmath116 and @xmath117 are flags in general position .",
    "stanley noted that skew schur polynomials have a similar geometric - cohomological interpretation  @xcite .",
    "schubert polynomials @xmath14 when @xmath19 has a single descent at position @xmath8 ( @xmath19 is a grassmannian permutation ) are schur symmetric polynomials in @xmath118 . even if @xmath19 and @xmath23 are grassmannian permutations with the same descent , then it is not necessarily the case that the skew schubert polynomial @xmath10 equals the corresponding skew schur polynomial .",
    "we illustrate this in @xmath119 , using partitions and skew partitions for indices of schur polynomials .",
    "we have the schubert / schur polynomials @xmath120 and also the skew schur polynomial @xmath121 on the other hand , @xmath122 and @xmath123 . by monk s formula ( or the pieri formula  ) , we compute @xmath124 to be    @xmath125 the first two terms of @xmath124 carry the same information as the two terms of @xmath126 , but there is also a third term . this is because the multiplication of schubert polynomials is richer than the multiplication of schur polynomials . by theorem  [ theoremone ] , this expansion of @xmath124 records the fact that @xmath127 is a summand ( with coefficient 1 ) in each of @xmath128 note that the last product ( unlike the first two ) is not symmetric in @xmath129 and @xmath130 even though both @xmath131 and @xmath127 are symmetric in @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "rc - graphs are combinatorial objects associated to permutations @xmath19 in the symmetric group @xmath15 .",
    "they were defined in @xcite as certain subsets of @xmath132 we may linearly order such a subset of pairs by setting @xmath133 let @xmath134 be the @xmath34th pair in this linear order . consider the sequence @xmath135 an rc - graph @xmath136 is _ associated _ to a permutation @xmath17 if @xmath137 is a reduced decomposition of @xmath19 .",
    "we denote the collection of rc - graphs associated to a permutation @xmath19 by @xmath138 , and the permutation corresponding to a given rc - graph @xmath136 by @xmath139 .",
    "we represent an rc - graph @xmath136 as a pseudoline diagram recording the history of the inversions of @xmath19 . to this end , draw @xmath42 pseudolines going up and to the right such that the @xmath34th pseudoline begins at position @xmath140 and ends at position @xmath141 .",
    "( the positions are numbered as in a matrix , as illustrated in example  [ exrc ] below . )",
    "the rule for constructing the pseudoline diagram is the following : two pseudolines entering at position @xmath142 cross at that position if @xmath142 is in @xmath136 , and otherwise avoid each other at that position .",
    "note that two pseudolines cross at most once , as @xmath137 is reduced .",
    "conversely , a pseudoline diagram represents a permutation @xmath19 , where @xmath143 is the endpoint of the pseudoline beginning at position @xmath140 .",
    "given a pseudoline diagram where no two pseudolines cross more than once , the crossings give an rc - graph associated to the permutation represented by the pseudoline diagram .",

    "indeed , we give such a bijection .    given an rc - graph @xmath136 in @xmath138 , we greedily construct the sequence of rc - graphs @xmath150 as follows .",
    "given @xmath151 , add the pair @xmath152 to @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the pair not in @xmath151 that is minimal in the lexicographic order on pairs .",
    "we have the following lemma .      1 .",
    "every subset @xmath151 is an rc - graph .",
    "2 .   @xmath154 is a saturated chain in bruhat order .",
    "3 .   if @xmath155 is obtained from @xmath151 by adding the pair @xmath152 , then in the labeled bruhat order we have the labeled cover @xmath156 4 .",
    "the labeled chain with the labels of @xmath157 is increasing .",
    "we prove the first statement by induction .",
    "suppose that @xmath151 is an rc - graph and we add the pair @xmath152 to obtain @xmath155 , where @xmath152 is the minimal pair not in @xmath151 .",
    "consider the pseudoline diagram of @xmath151 near the position @xmath152 : @xmath159 by construction , @xmath151 contains every crossing in the shaded region , so the two pseudolines at this position never cross , with one connecting @xmath8 to @xmath160 as drawn . adding the crossing gives a new pseudoline diagram for a permutation with exactly one more inversion .",
    "indeed , assume that we create a double crossing between one of the two pseudolines obtained from the drawn ones by adding the extra crossing and another pseudoline .",
    "it is easy to check graphically that this can only happen if the latter pseudoline meets the pseudoline connecting @xmath8 to @xmath160 in @xmath151 twice .",
    "but this is impossible , as @xmath151 is an rc - graph .",
    "these arguments show that @xmath161 , implying the second statement . for the third , note",
    "that @xmath152 is a possible label , and the fourth follows by our greedy algorithm for adding pairs not in @xmath136 .",
    "observe that the increasing chain @xmath162 constructed in lemma  [ l : rc - chain ] from an rc - graph @xmath136 has the property that @xmath163 _ a priori _ , given that @xmath164 is a cover , we are only guaranteed that @xmath165 with @xmath166 .",
    "we prove that this property holds for any increasing chain ending in @xmath71 , and also that the map @xmath167 is a bijection from @xmath138 to @xmath70 .",
    "this will immediately imply proposition  [ prop : schub - constr ] .",
    "we prove these statements by downward induction on @xmath18 .",
    "they hold trivially when @xmath169 .",
    "consider the first two steps in @xmath63 : @xmath170 since @xmath63 is increasing , we have @xmath171 or @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "since the part of the chain beginning with @xmath24 is an increasing chain , our inductive hypothesis implies that subsequent covers involve only positions of @xmath24 greater than or equal to @xmath8 . thus if @xmath174 , we must have @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath181 and @xmath188 so that @xmath172 and we then have @xmath173 .",
    "then @xmath189 and so the betweenness condition on covers @xmath190 is violated .",
    "this completes the proof of statement 1 .    for the second statement , consider the procedure of successively removing labels @xmath152 of covers of @xmath63 from the rc - graph of @xmath71 ( which contains all crossings ) .",
    "suppose that this process applied to the chain   above @xmath24 has created an rc - graph @xmath136 associated to @xmath24 .",
    "we argue that removing the crossing @xmath191 from @xmath136 creates an rc - graph associated to @xmath19 .",
    "first , @xmath191 is a crossing of @xmath136 , as we have only removed crossings that exceed @xmath191 in the lexicographic order . consider the pseudoline diagram of @xmath136 near @xmath191 , which we represent on the left . @xmath192 note that @xmath136 contains all crossings in the shaded region .",
    "removing the crossing at @xmath191 creates the picture on the right . arguing as in the proof of lemma  [ l : rc - chain ] ( but in reverse )",
    "shows that we obtain an rc - graph associated to @xmath19 .",
    "property   of increasing chains from @xmath19 to @xmath71 implies that the branching in the tree of increasing chains from @xmath19 to @xmath71 is quite simple ; it only depends upon the permutation at a node and not on the history of the chain .",
    "the branches at a permutation @xmath23 consists of all possible covers @xmath193 , where @xmath8 is the minimal position @xmath34 such that @xmath194 and @xmath195 and @xmath9 is any position greater than @xmath8 such that @xmath196 and if @xmath49 , then @xmath197 is not between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we may order the branches at @xmath23 by the position @xmath9 .",
    "this leads to an efficient lexicographic search of this tree for generating all such increasing chains , and thus all rc - graphs in @xmath138 as well as the multiset of monomials in the schubert polynomial @xmath198 .",
    "the computational complexity and memory usage of this algorithm depend only upon @xmath42 ( the number of entries in @xmath19 ) , the length @xmath199 of @xmath19 , and the number of increasing chains , @xmath200 .",
    "this is true , in fact , for any algorithm generating @xmath201 combinatorial objects corresponding to the monomials in the schubert polynomial @xmath198 .",
    "furthermore , it is not hard to see that the above algorithm is of order @xmath202 , where @xmath203 .",
    "indeed , note that the number of internal nodes of a rooted tree with a fixed number of leaves ( @xmath201 in our case ) and a fixed distance from its root to all its leaves ( @xmath9 in our case ) is maximized by the tree with all internal nodes having only one descendant ; thus , there are @xmath204 nodes . on the other hand ,",
    "finding the descendants of a given node is of order @xmath205 .",
    "let us also note that a closely related algorithm , with the same complexity as the one above , appears in  @xcite ; it is described in terms of removing crossings from the rc - graph corresponding to @xmath71 .",
    "more precisely , the authors of the mentioned papers use combinatorial versions of the divided difference operators in order to recursively generate the rc - graphs corresponding to a permutation @xmath19 .",
    "one starts from @xmath71 and applies these operators using any chain in the weak order on @xmath15 from @xmath71 to @xmath19 . a certain choice of chain guarantees that each rc - graph in the obtained tree has at least one descendant upon applying the corresponding operator .",
    "it turns out that the rc - graphs on a given level @xmath34 in this tree correspond ( via the bijection described above ) to the subchains starting at level @xmath206 in the tree constructed by the previous algorithm .",
    "while this algorithm for generating the multiset of monomials in the schubert polynomial @xmath207 also computes this polynomial , a.  buch has pointed out to us that the transition formula of lascoux and schtzenberger  @xcite provides a more efficient algorithm to _ compute _ @xmath207 .",
    "we conclude by mentioning the connection with the insertion algorithm for rc - graphs in @xcite , which bijectively proves the pieri formula   for multiplying a schubert polynomial by a complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial @xmath208 . given an rc - graph @xmath136 with @xmath209 ,",
