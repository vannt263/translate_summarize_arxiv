    "n recent years , several models for the movement of crowds have been proposed .",
    "one can distinguish between two general approaches : microscopic and macroscopic models . in the microscopic scope ( range ) , pedestrians are treated as individual entities ( particles ) .",
    "the particle interactions in this model are determined by physical and social rules as well as the interactions between the particles with their physical surrounding . in this context",
    "we cite , the social - force models ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , the cellular automata , e.g @xcite , queuing models e.g. @xcite , or continuum dynamic approaches like @xcite . for an extensive survey of different microscopic approaches",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the origin of the microscopic models for pedestrian behaviour can be traced back to the work of reynolds in the years 1987 and 1999 @xcite .",
    "this model was extended by the sociological factors introduced in @xcite , psychological effects in @xcite , social forces @xcite , and other models of pedestrian behaviour @xcite .",
    "many methods have been developed to describe the short range forces responsible for the collision avoidance between nearby pedestrians .",
    "these include geometrically - based algorithms @xcite , grid - based methods @xcite and force - based methods @xcite .",
    "in contrast to microscopic models , macroscopic models treat the pedestrians flow as continuum homogeneous mass that behaves like a fluid without considering the behaviour of single individuals .",
    "many methods use concepts familiar from fluid and gas dynamics , see @xcite .",
    "modelling pedestrian dynamics as a fluid can be traced back to @xcite .",
    "more recent models are based on optimal transportation methods @xcite , mean field games ( see @xcite for a general introduction ) or non - linear conservation laws @xcite .",
    "pedflow is a microscopic simulation model developed by lhner simulation technologies international , inc .",
    "( lsti ) @xcite . in this",
    "model individuals are treated as self - driven particles that interact through social and physical rules .",
    "each person in the pedestrian flow has a desired position and desired velocity and adapts his or her current velocity according to the surrounding neighbour ; furthermore , each crowd member simultaneously tries to avoid collision with other crowd members and any environmental boundaries .",
    "the current velocity and direction of a single individual in the crowd is a result of the circumstances and social interactions .",
    "these social forces can be influenced by the environment , other people and internal states .",
    "force plays an essential role in every crowd model .",
    "it can be classified in two major categories , internal and external forces .",
    "forces are characteristics of crowds and crowd disasters",
    ". force has a direct effect on movement : for example force drives people out of rest to their desired velocities , or force can make deviate people from their desired direction . in dangerous crowd situations , force can be the key to decode the fatal consequences ( e.g. injuries and death ) .",
    "many force effects are summarized and documented by fruin @xcite .    in this approach",
    "the pedestrians are treated as `` particles '' moving according to newton s law : @xmath2 here @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the mass , velocity and position of the pedestrian , and @xmath6 the sum of all forces exerted by it or acting on it .",
    "the basic unknown that requires intensive modelling efforts in these equation is the force - vector . in the sequel",
    ", we will discuss the main forces that can be identified acting on a pedestrian .      in the pedflow model ,",
    "the forces that accelerate a pedestrian are the result of internal ( will ) and external ( collision , signals , etc . ) forces .",
    "an `` individual alert '' tries to avoid collisions before they happen , resulting in vanishing external forces .",
    "however , if the pedestrian density increases , collision forces will appear , and the ability to move freely will be impaired .",
    "the difference between external and internal forces is too rigorous and only serves descriptive purposes in the present context .",
    "so , what are the forces that act on the pedestrian ?    * internal forces ( active , intentional ) * * will force ( get there in time ) * * pedestrian collision avoidance forces * * wall / obstacle collision avoidance forces * external forces ( passive , suffered ) * * physical pedestrians collision forces ( physical contact ) * * physical wall / obstacle collision forces ( physical contact )      each particle is programmed to have a final goal that it wants to reach . the motivation to move towards this goal",
    "is given by the driving force , or so called will force @xmath7 and denotes the self - driven force that drives an individual towards their desired velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : willforce-1 ] ) .",
    "the self - driven force is based on a simple error correction term consisting of the difference between an individuals desired velocity , and a desired direction @xmath8 , and their actual velocity .",
    "this difference in velocity is corrected over a specified time interval @xmath9 , referred to as the relaxation time , that corresponds to the finite amount of time that is required for people to react and physically change their velocity .    in the following ,",
    "we denote by will force the force that will accelerate ( or decelerate ) a pedestrian to achieve the velocity it desires . given a desired velocity @xmath10 and the current velocity @xmath4",
    ", this force will be of the form    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is a function of `` list of circumstances ''     denotes the self - driven force that drives an individual towards their desired velocity . ]",
    "the modeling aspect is included in the function @xmath13 , which in the non - linear case may itself be a function of @xmath14 .",
    "suppose @xmath13 is constant , and that only the will force is acting .",
    "furthermore , consider a pedestrian at rest .",
    "the pedestrian could start from rest @xmath15 and wants to reach the desired velocity @xmath10 . in this case",
    ", we have : @xmath16 , with @xmath17 we have @xmath18 .",
    "the solution of this equation is given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 we can thus obtain @xmath13 by measuring the time required to reach a percentage ( e.g. 90 percent ) of the desired velocity , starting from rest ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : relaxationtime-1 ] ) .",
    "this time is typically in the range of 0.5 - 1.0 s , but obviously depends on the current state of fitness , stress , climate and terrain condition , and desire to reach a goal .",
    "we can define the function @xmath22 via `` relaxation time '' @xmath23 s. typical values for the desired velocity @xmath10 and relaxation time @xmath9 are @xmath24 = 1.35 m / s and @xmath9 = o(0.5 to 1.0 s ) .",
    "medicinal facts and human experience show that older pedestrians walk more slowly than younger pedestrians .",
    "this effect has a significant impact on the `` relaxation time '' of a single pedestrian , hence it is easier to assess that younger pedestrians reach their desired velocity faster than older pedestrians .     , which is referred to as the relaxation time , that corresponds to the finite amount of time that is required for people to react and physically change their velocity .",
    "]        in normal cases , the will force @xmath7 takes the direction of the desired velocity @xmath10 as shown in figure [ fig : desiredvelocity-1 ] .     towards a desired destination and",
    "adapts the current velocity according to the environmental situation . ]",
    "traditionally the will forces are specified by a desired velocity of the pedestrian and the trajectory .",
    "the will force will be implemented as a vector on the simulation model . however , in the motivation to reach certain places , there are tasks in which the desired motions of individuals are specified by the state of system ( list of circumstances ) rather than time . for such tasks , desired velocity field control has been proposed . in this chapter , a method to extend our information about the forces that drive the individuals from rest to their desired velocities is evaluated .    * in the case of group movement , the will force takes the direction of the group leader .",
    "+    + figure [ fig : followme-1 ] illustrates a group of pedestrians following their leader .",
    "a `` group '' is defined as a physical collection of people following the same route , but who may or may not be part of the same social group , and a `` subgroup '' is defined as people within the same physical `` group '' who want to stay together , like friends or family members .",
    "several studies have revealed that smaller subgroups constitute the majority of the people in a crowd .",
    "but very few studies are able to model the `` subgroup '' behaviour . a particular subgroup concerns pedestrians who hold hands .",
    "it is recognized that holding hands is the most effective way of keeping children safe from traffic injury @xcite .",
    "all the group members take the desired position and the desired velocity of the group leader . * in the case of an emergency or dangerous situation , the will force takes the direction of the nearest exit and this has dramatic consequences on the behaviour of pedestrians at the exit .",
    "they block each other and this builds up a rigid arc from which no one can escape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nearestexit-1 ] and [ fig : arcformation-1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : nearestexit-1 ] demonstrate the situation of pedestrians in case of emergency or dangerous situation",
    ". the will force points to the direction of the nearest exit .",
    "this picture illustrates the situation when people take the proper precaution to prevent potential hazards when they are alerted .",
    "for example , in case of an emergency , evacuating the building immediately by using the closest exit and going to the designated meeting location .",
    "panic breaks out , if many individuals attempt to escape an emergency area at the same time , often the emergency exits are blocked in a short time , and the situations have a fatal consequence for survival and leads to injuries or death through crushing people in a crowd .",
    "real world example ( fire safety : general evacuation procedures ) : learn the location of the two nearest exits from your work area ( often these are down staircases)@xcite .",
    "the priority in the emergency or dangerous situations like fire in a building or earthquake are designed to reach each particle the nearest exit in a short time . in first step",
    "the particle choose their priority destination after that they can find the beeline towards the nearest exit .",
    "\\(a ) collision avoidance forces + in the collision avoidance process , autonomous particles need to discover the environment to avoid static and dynamic obstacles . at any time the distance between each obstacle , wall , and the particle @xmath25 are computed , go both of them closer to each other , then calculate the angle between particle @xmath25 s desired direction and the line joining the center of particle @xmath25 and the obstacle . this effect can be seen within the rectangle of influence ( figure [ fig : collisionavoidance-2 ] ) .",
    "the distance and the angle play a significant role to assess how relevant the obstacle is to the trajectory .",
    "when travelling the environment , particles also update their perceived crowd density , which is necessary for their decision making process .",
    "we denote by intermediate range forces that change the motion of an individual in order to avoid an encounter with another .",
    "the observation employed here is that all of us will try to avoid a collision by moving away from an encounter long before it happens .",
    "the nature of these forces is such that they act mainly in a direction normal to the current motion of the individual , and therefore do not lead to a significant decrease in velocity .",
    "moreover , this force is only active if a collision is sensed .        using as a starting point the situation depicted in figure [ fig : collisionavoidance-2 ] , given two pedestrians with current coordinates and velocities @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , an encounter may be computed by evaluating the time increment @xmath30 at which the distance between the two is minimized , i.e. , @xmath31^{2 }    \\rightarrow   min$ ] .",
    "this results in @xmath32(\\vec{v}_{1 } - \\vec{v}_{2 } ) = 0 ,   $ ] or @xmath33 .",
    "the minimum distance is given by @xmath34 .",
    "obviously , the force will only become active if @xmath35 . the general nature of this force is such that it will decrease with distance .",
    "how exactly this decrease function looks like is unknown at the present time ( it may even be random ) . we have used a function based on the normalized distance between the pedestrians @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the characteristic radius of pedestrian 1 , which is of the form : @xmath38 .",
    "this simple repulsion force may be refined further by considering the directions along and normal to the current velocity vector @xmath27 , denoted by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "we can then split the normalized distance @xmath41 into a tangential and normal component : @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to tangential and normal forces of the form : @xmath44 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 can be related to the relaxation time , i.e. it is not too difficult to obtain .",
    "we have used @xmath46 = o(4 ) @xmath47 4 [ m / sec@xmath48 .",
    "\\(b ) avoiding a wall + avoidance forces @xmath49 are calculated only for relevant obstacles , walls and agents : i.e. those falling within the rectangle of influence .",
    "the avoidance force for obstacle w is illustrate in figure [ fig : wallavoiding-1 ] .",
    "the calculation is done in the same way as for the force of the pedestrian - pedestrian repulsion and the same formulas are used .",
    "only the pedestrian - pedestrian distance has to be replaced by the distance of the pedestrian from the wall .",
    "and the dashed arrow indicates the trajectory path of the particle . ]        * pedestrian collision : for more realistic crowd simulation and for a description of realistic counter - flows and overtaking behaviours , many attributes influencing the behaviour of people in the real world will be considered .",
    "this approach has the ability to simulate human behaviour by setting parameters obtained from many observations related to real human movement .",
    "in avoiding an obstacle the factors affecting the tangential forces are : * * the distance between the particle and any obstacles . * * the relative direction and movement of the agents i.e. the direction between the desired velocities vectors ( @xmath27 and @xmath29 for example ) . * * crowd density : if an agent enter the interaction rectangle , a tangential force ( see fig . [",
    "fig : collisionavoidance-2 ] ) will be active to change the direction of movement and make a curve in the path to avoid collision .",
    "the angle between two agents is used to simulate the individual decision making how to react to a previous collision . for example , in a walking floor , if there is enough space between us and another person , none of us would change the direction . in case of many persons walking in the corridor ,",
    "the majority of people tend to move to the right .",
    "therefore , when the velocity vectors are almost collinear , the tangential forces pointing to the right . in case",
    "an agent @xmath50 detects agent @xmath51 and agent as possible obstacles , then the system computes the distance vector towards agent @xmath52 as follow ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "agent @xmath54 is farther away from @xmath52 , but since it is moving against agent @xmath52 , the system gives this obstacle higher priority .",
    "+    + once a pedestrian has moved close enough to obstacles or other pedestrians , his velocity will be decreased markedly , ( see fig .",

    "the geometry of the problem is shown in figure[fig : movinggrid-1 ] .",
    "pedestrians enter the domain from the left and exit to the right . for this case , each pedestrian has the goal of reaching first the entrance of the passage , then to traverse it to the other end , and finally to exit on the right . a typical snapshot during one of the simulations is shown in figure[fig : movinggrid-1 ] .",

    "the congested area increases the density sometimes up to 7 or 8 persons / m@xmath66 . in consequence",
    "the pedestrians begin to push to increase their personal space and create shock - waves propagating through the crowd .",
    "figure [ fig : haramwithoutcoul2 ] ( c ) displays a pilgrims movement simulation within mataf area . the entire influx consists of three uni - directional pedestrian flows coming from three entrances .",
    "the velocity indicator shows that the movement in the edges of the mataf area is faster than in the area of the kaaba .",
    "the picture shows a snapshot of the simulation at 38 s , which has a particularly high density of 6.5 persons / m@xmath66 .",
    "also note that the pedestrian density is very high at the places where the tawaf begins and ends .",
    "note the clumping of pedestrians going in opposing directions , when the pilgrims finish the tawaf .",
    "the average density for many runs was 5 to 6.5 persons / m@xmath66 , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : haramwithoutcoul2 ] ( d ) ) .",
    "the second set of simulations consisted of the pedestrian flow through the mataf area with columns , ( see fig . [",
    "fig : haramwithcolumn2 ] ) .",
    "the parameters are the same as in section [ sec : simulation_first_set ] .",
    "after pedestrians finish the tawaf ( seven times circling around the kaaba ) they are going in the direction of say .",
    "the measured densities are again 5 - 6 persons / m@xmath66 with up to 7 or 8 persons / m@xmath66 in the congested area .",
    "thus , all results are identical with the simulation without the columns , cf .  section [ sec : simulation_first_set ] .",
    "obviously the columns do not influence the densities and velocities of the pilgrims in the congested area .",
    "the only observable difference are the vacant rings on the circles defined by the positions of the columns .",
    "figure [ fig : haramwithcolumn3 ] illustrates two simulation snap - shots with different entire influx . the pedestrian streaming the mataf area from three entrances are indicated by the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 in figure [ fig : haramwithcolumn3 ] ( b ) .",
    "the velocity indicator shows furthermore that the congested area still is in the interior zone near the kaaba and at the area where the tawaf begins and ends .",
    "the picture shows a snapshot of the simulation at 38 s , which has a particularly high density of 6.5 persons / m@xmath66 .",
    "for the first moment one can not realise the difference to the results illustrated in figure [ fig : haramwithoutcoul2 ] and figure [ fig : haramwithcolumn2 ] , both pictures exhibit the same critical points .",
    "note the clumping of pedestrians going in opposing directions , when the pilgrims finish the tawaf .",
    "one may conclude that the columns have little influence on the movement of pilgrims but one can clearly see a vacant ring along the columns and this results from repulsive interaction between the particles and the columns , this effect is better seen in case of lower crowd density . in case of high density crowd the pressure between the individuals is so huge that this vacant ring along the column disappears .",
    "this means that under the enormous surrounding pressure , people are forced to come near the pillar .",
    "here we stress that the small size and smooth form of the column is very important to prevent people injury or dangerous situations .",
    "pedestrian distribution on the used surface must be identified with the fundamental diagrams ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fundamentaldiagram-1 ] ) .    .",
    "in this range bodies will be pressed or deformed , resulting in high injury scales with possible fatal consequences . ]",
    "we divided the mataf area into three parts according to the density distribution .",
    "the first part is the area near the kaaba wall .",
    "the second part is the middle of the mataf , the area between 10 m and 20 m from the kaaba wall .",
    "the third part is the edge of the mataf , the area between 20 m and 30 m.    * the first part of the mataf area : * * usable area = 820 m@xmath66 . * * the mean pedestrian density = 6 pilgrims / m@xmath66 . * * the total number of pilgrims = 4920 pilgrims . * * the mean pedestrian path = 91 m. * * the mean tawaf path = 91 @xmath67 7 = 637 m. * * the tawaf lasts 39 min with average walking velocity of 0.266 m / s = 15,96 m / min . * * the capacity is 7596 pilgrims tawaf / hour    * the second part of the mataf area * * usable area = 1380 m@xmath66 . * * the mean pedestrian density = 3,68 pilgrims / m@xmath66 . * * the total number of pilgrims = 5078 pilgrims . * * the mean pedestrian path = 151 m. * * the mean tawaf path = 151 @xmath67 7 = 1057 m. * * the tawaf takes 52,85 min with average walking velocity of 0,33 m / s = 20 m / min . * * the capacity is 5859 pilgrims tawaf / hour .    * the third part of the mataf area * * usable area = 1900 m@xmath66 . *",
    "* the mean pedestrian density = 2 pilgrims / m@xmath66 . * * the total number of pedestrians = 3800 pilgrims . * * the mean pedestrian path = 212 m. * * the mean tawaf path = 212 @xmath67 7 = 1484 m. * * the tawaf lasts 49,46 min with average walking velocity of 0.5 m / s = 30 m / min . * * the capacity is 4653 pilgrims tawaf / hour .    the total capacity of the mataf is 18923 pilgrims tawaf / hour .",
    "according to several studies about the haram , the actual capacity of the entire mataf ( ground , intermediate floors and the roof ) are around 50,000 pilgrims / hour , but the capacity of the new massaa is much higher than the capacity of the existing mataf . during peak times worshippers are in danger of injuries due to extreme high density in the mataf . to increase the capacity and improve the conditions for worshippers a new additional floor for the mataf called temporary mataf has been developed .",
    "the new floor is based on a modules concept with fast assembly and disassembly without interruption of ongoing tawaf .",
    "this light weight structure is designed to be integrated into the existing haram mosque .",
    "the outer diameter is about 94 m , the inside diameter is around 70 m and the width is around 12 m ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mmataf5 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "an additional area of 3000 m@xmath66 is added to the existing mataf area .",
    "access is achieved over several ramps .",
    "the clearance height is around 2.7 m leaving enough space for worshipper to pass underneath .",
    "the idea to develop a new moving platform above the existing mataf has the goal to take pedestrian pressure from the old mataf .",
    "the design and evolution of this mobile area revealed a new concept concerning the safety and fluidity of pilgrims flow . in the next paragraphs",
    "we discuss two approaches with two different geometries and we present our analysis data .    * mobile mataf with extension : we shall discuss * * geometry * * simulation results * * capacity of the mataf according to predtetschenski and milinski densities      this set of simulations considers a unidirectional pedestrian flow circling the holy kaaba seven times",
    ". different strengths of the influx of pilgrims were used , see table [ tab : simulation-1].the walking pedestrian area named mobile floor for the expansion of the mataf contains two exits and one emergency exit .",
    "the design of the mobile mataf allows one - directional pedestrian flow ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mmataf5 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the parameters used in the simulations were the desired velocity of the individual @xmath24 , the individual radius @xmath64 and the relaxation time @xmath9 .",
    "the size or radius of particles are given in table [ tab : projectionarea ] and according to predtetschenski and milinski @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , all parameters are identical for each person .",
    ".set of different individual sizes @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "with the increasing number of pilgrims every year and with the dramatic evolution of the transportation system in the world , the design and architecture of the haram mosque in mecca must be changed to increase the capacity , throughput and performance .",
    "the proposed and evaluated design has a specific aim , the safety of pilgrims . in order to ensure that the proposed design satisfies the required criteria of pilgrims safety , especially during overcrowding , many simulations and tests were realized to access the critical points in the mataf area .",
    "the new mataf area was designed to satisfy the international standard criterion of pedestrians safety , especially during overcrowding .",
    "the flow of pilgrims is demanding , since any accumulation in this area can be dangerous and has fatal consequences .",
    "the new proposed design offers a significant improvement to the safety of pilgrims .",
    "the limited spatial possibilities in and around the haram area for infrastructural development requires an in - depth analysis and search for solutions to solve the problem of pedestrian flow . from this",
    "the concept arises to build a temporary mataf to take a small capacity from the ground mataf as best arrangements during the massive extension project in masjid al - haram .",
    "the mataf area is a very restrained plain .",
    "the construction of the temporary mataf within masjid al haram should attempt to resolve many problems to avoid a potential disaster in the future , such as the overcrowding disaster at the jamarat bridge in 2005 .",
    "the conceptual design as we can see in figure [ fig : mobile - mataf - extension ] has two problems ; the first problem concerns the fluidity of the movement on the platform especially at the exits , the second problem concerns the ground mataf in that the fluidity of pedestrian flow will be disturbed through the pillars carrying the platform .",
    "the haram building must ensure the international norm of safety to allow the increased number of pilgrims .",
    "to prevent stampede and congestion within the mataf area during the rush hour of the hajj events a sufficient study and analysis of the expected inflows and outflows ( and , hence , number of pilgrims ) must be ascertained and documented , considering the alternation possibility of large pedestrian flows .",
    "a narrow passage and bottleneck analysis within the haram mosque area is crucial for any decision making . through exact simulation and analysis of pedestrian fluidity on the haram area the congestion points as the intersection or crossing points",
    "must be established and should be removed .",
    "either the passages with counter flow must be detected as early as possible and carefully treated ( examined ) .",
    "this analysis can be used to assess the potential safety hazards and can be helpful for the organizers . as critical points the exits of the haram must be checked .",
    "the passage between the mataf area and the massaa area and between the pillars of the temporary mataf can cause problems for the fluidity of the pilgrim streams .    for the safety of all pilgrims on the haram area and to ensure a quick and effective response to any occurring problems a sophisticated and continuously monitoring system ( e.g. video surveillance ) must be established .",
    "an engineering system must be developed within the haram to allow the security and emergency forces to move as quickly as possible and unobstructed to any place if something happens , to remove or at least mitigate problems .",
    "the main problem in mecca itself are the traffic jams .",
    "the high density of cars and buses combined with walking or road crossing pedestrians make the situation more complex for rescue or evacuation plans .",
    "the possibility to be stampeded at hajj pilgrimage is very high at all places and especially inside the haram in mecca , in muzdalifa , at the jamarat and on the streets between the so called points of interest .    the changes necessary for a successful hajj and its activities are all contained in the wider long - term plan for mecca .",
    "the next expansion for haram and massaa requires a new infrastructure and regeneration of the east end - which will reclaim old neighbourhoods to haram for housing and parking area - which is a huge project .",
    "a newly developed simulation software for analysing pilgrim movement was used for the evaluation of the tawaf capacity of the mataf area and the new mobile floor .",
    "different scenarios were analysed to find out the optimal capacity . with a flux of only 12 pilgrim / min entering the floor ,",
    "much space was left unused .",
    "pilgrims moved with their desired speed and the average time for completing a tawaf took around 25 minutes .",
    "the second scenario showed 108 pilgrim / min entering the floor , causing the space to become fully occupied by pilgrims and the velocity to decrease , resulting in dangerous jams especially in the exit area .",
    "the third scenario showed the optimum steady state when about 125 pilgrim enter per minute and also exit the floor , with no jams .",
    "this results in an overall capacity of about 9000 finished tawaf / hour and an average time of approximately 25 min to complete the tawaf .",
    "this work is an attempt to model high density crowd dynamic flows in autonomous and controlled scenarios .",
    "a microscopic approach was used to model this problem based on observed collective behaviour in emergency conditions , where the detailed design of interactions is overlapped by group behaviour .",
    "we presented a simple means of achieving more complex behaviour in both indoor and outdoor environments .",
    "the simulation tools produce results that compare favourably with the real data .    as a practical example",
    ", the haram mosque in mecca and the jamarat bridge in saudi arabia were used for high density crowd simulation : the huge number of pilgrims cramming the bridge during the pilgrimage to mecca caused serious pedestrian disasters in the 90 s . moreover , the analytical and numerical study of the qualitative behaviour of human individuals in a crowd with high densities can also improve traditional socio - biological investigation methods",
    ".    for obtaining empirical data different methods were used , automatic and manual methods .",
    "we analysed video recordings of the crowd movement in the tawaf within the mosque in mecca during the hajj of the 27th of november , 2009 .",
    "we evaluated unique video recordings of a 105@xmath67 154 m large mataf area taken from the roof of the mosque @xcite .",
    "for the validation and calibration of the simulation tools , different methods were used @xcite . at medium to high pedestrian densities",
    ", the techniques used in pedflow can produce realistic crowd motion , with pedestrians moving at different speeds and under different circumstances , following believable trails and taking sensible avoidance action .    as possible future work",
    ", we would like to have a better understanding of the parameters influencing the crowd behaviour such as the ethnic and psychological parameters .",
    "these parameters have a significant impact on the movement of crowds especially in panic situations .",
    "the psychological - physiological parameters in the case of riots or emergencies must be investigated further and documented so that they can be implemented into other models . our proposed approach to simulate crowd behaviours in the future",
    "is based on this dichotomy , and we propose separate models for an agent s personality and another one to account for situational factors .",
    "this question arises and opens the door to many topics that must be further investigated .",
    "there are certain things we can do to help a high density crowd participant like pilgrims , sport or music event spectators to survive a stressful situation , by planning , preparation , training and better management .",
    "but this is not sufficient to make sure that hundred percent of the crowd are safe , if we consider the number of accidents happened in the last decade .",
