    "we also shown that an alternatively rotated orbital basis due to the staggered trigonal axes explains the periodic density - modulation observed in _ ab initio _ calculations . moreover , since the very presence of trigonal distortion breaks the ( approximate ) rotational symmetry of @xmath2 orbitals , orthogonal magnetic structure thus comes naturally from spin - orbit interaction and the staggering of trigonal axes .",

    "@xcite    interestingly , the above - mentioned gauge - like symmetry is absent for 120@xmath3 model on pyrochlore lattice .",

    "as we shall discuss later , spin - orbit coupling gives rise to an orthogonal magnetic order in 120@xmath3 model , which is in stark contrast to collinear spins in the case of @xmath4-type orbital order .",

    "we have found six classical ground states with collinear pseudospins perpendicular to either one of the three unit vectors characterizing the anisotropic interactions .",
    "the classical ground state is further shown to be stable against quantum fluctuations .",
    "the ground - state structure obtained from our model is consistent with main experimental observations and _ ab initio _ calculation of mnv@xmath0o@xmath1 , namely , an antiferro - orbital order with tetragonal @xmath16 space group , a density - modulation along orbital chains , and an orthogonal magnetic structure .",
    "the orbital order corresponding to the semiclassical ground states consists of two inequivalent orbital chains running along @xmath222 and @xmath223 directions , similar to the so - called @xmath4-type antiferro - orbital order .",
    "however , the staggering of trigonal axes along orbital chains gives rise to a periodic variation of the electron density function , which is absent in the @xmath4-type order .",
    "moreover , since the trigonal distortion breaks the approximate rotational symmetry of @xmath2 orbitals , orthogonal magnetic structure is shown to be stabilized by the staggering of the single - ion spin anisotropies .",
    "the overall orientation of the orthogonal structure actually depends on the relative strength of effective orbital exchange @xmath120 and spin - orbit coupling @xmath197 .",

    "noting that @xmath120 also includes contributions from @xmath119 phonons , results from the two complementary approaches ( large trigonal field vs large-@xmath225 ) are actually consistent : stabilization of the experimentally proposed orthogonal structure requires a dominant @xmath119 distortion as well as a smaller spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by recent _ ab initio _ calculation which shows that inclusion of spin - orbit coupling does not significantly change the spin - orbital order ( a finite @xmath226 coupling , however , is still required to provide the spin anisotropies ) .",

    "to explicitly take into account the cooperative nature of phonon - mediated orbital exchange , we consider coupling of orbitals to nonlocal lattice vibrations .",

    "@xcite to further simplify the discussion , we notice that all experimentally observed structural distortion in vanadium spinels preserves the lattice translational symmetry .",
    "we thus restrict our analysis to phonons with wavevector @xmath227 .    since orbitals mainly couple to oxygen ions , we focus on normal modes which are dominated by oxygen displacements .",
    "the 8 oxygen ions in a primitive unit cell of spinel form two tetrahedra related to each other by inversion symmetry . in the following , we confine ourselves to oxygen phonons with odd parity ( coupling to even - parity oxygen modes cancels identically ) . among the remaining modes , we find that the doublet @xmath228 and triplet @xmath119 phonons are most effective in jt coupling .",
