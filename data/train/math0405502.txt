    "we obtain knots from braids via the well - known closing operation adapted to our situation .",
    "so , we have :    the _ closure _ @xmath33 of a geometric mixed braid @xmath34 is an operation that results in an oriented mixed link , and it is realized by joining each pair of corresponding ( slightly bent ) endpoints _ of the @xmath29-part _ by a vertical segment , either _ over _ or _ under _ the rest of the braid , according to the label attached to these endpoints ( see fig . 5 for an example )",

    "5 . closure of a geometric mixed braid .",
    "note that the strands of @xmath10 do not participate in the closure operation , that s why they are assumed to be infinitely extensible .",
    "besides , the labelling ` u ' or ` o ' for corresponding endpoints in definition 4 is precisely an instruction on how to perform the closure . different choices of labels will yield in general non - isotopic links in @xmath4 , as the example in fig .",

    "@xcite ) . note that in both @xmath4 and @xmath37 , if we remove @xmath10 from a mixed braid , we are left with a braid in @xmath1 .",
    "this will be a labelled braid in the case of @xmath4 .",
    "but this is equivalent to the familiar unlabelled picture of a classical braid , since a closing arc labelled ` o ' can slide freely over to the side and then to the back of the braid , thus aquiring the label ` u ' ( see fig . 7 ) .",
    "this isotopy is the reason that mixed braids in @xmath37 are not labelled , since in the set - up of @xcite @xmath10 participates also in the closure of the braid ( contrary to @xmath4 ) .",

    ".    _ proof . _",
    "we apply the braiding algorithm of @xcite on a diagram @xmath13 of the pl mixed link @xmath12 . by general position",
    "@xmath13 contains no horizontal arcs with respect to the height function .",
    "the idea of the braiding is on the one hand to keep the arcs of the diagram that are oriented downwards with respect to the height function , and on the other hand to eliminate the ones that go upwards and produce instead braid strands .",
    "we call these arcs _",
    "opposite arcs_. now , the point is that the subbraid @xmath10 will not be touched by the algorithm , so the opposite arcs will be arcs of the link @xmath3 .",
    "the elimination of the opposite arcs is based on the following : if we run along an opposite arc we are likely to meet a succession of overcrossings and undercrossings .",
    "we subdivide ( marking with points ) every opposite arc into smaller  if necessary ",
    "pieces , each containing crossings of only _",
    "one _ type ; i.e. we may have :    @xmath40    fig . 8 .",
    "we call the resulting pieces _ up - arcs _ , and we label every up - arc with an _ ` o ' _ resp . _ ` u ' _ according as it is the _ over _ resp . _ under _ arc of a crossing ( or some crossings ) . if it is a",
    "_ free up - arc _",
    "( one that contains no crossings ) , then we have a choice whether to label it _ ` o ' _ or _ `",
    "u'_. the idea is to eliminate the opposite arc by eliminating its up - arcs one by one and create instead a pair of braid strands for each up - arc .",
    "let now @xmath41 be the top vertex of the up - arc @xmath42 ( see fig .",
    "associated to @xmath42 is the _ sliding triangle _",
    "@xmath43 , which is a special case of a triangle needed for a @xmath22move ; it is right - angled with hypotenuse @xmath42 and with the right angle lying below the up - arc .",
    "note that , if @xmath42 is itself vertical , then @xmath43 degenerates into the arc @xmath42 .",
    "we say that a sliding triangle is of type _ over _ or _ under _ according to the label of the up - arc it is associated with .",
    "( this implies that there may be triangles of the same type lying one on top of the other . )",
    "the germ of our braiding process is this .",
    "suppose for definiteness that @xmath42 is of type _",
    "over_. then we cut @xmath42 at @xmath41 and we pull the two ends , the top upwards and the lower downwards , and both _ over _ the rest of the diagram , so as to create a pair of corresponding strands of the anticipated braid ( see fig .",
    "finally , we perform a @xmath22-move across the sliding triangle @xmath43 . by general position",
    "the resulting diagram will be regular and @xmath44 may be assumed to slope slightly downwards .",
    "if @xmath42 were _ under _ then the pulling of the two ends would be _ under _ the rest of the diagram .",
    "note that the effect of these two operations has been to replace the up - arc @xmath42 by three arcs none of which is an up - arc , and the two of them being corresponding braid strands .",
    "therefore we now have fewer up - arcs .",
    "@xmath45    fig .",

    "( as already noted , in @xcite this labelling was not needed . ) after eliminating all up - arcs we obtain a geometric mixed braid , denoted @xmath46 the closure of which is obviously isotopic to @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , from definition 5 , the closing arc of two corresponding endpoints of the braid is precisely a stretched version of the initial up - arc , since it bears the same label . @xmath47",
    "the proof of theorem 2 is analogous to the one in section 3 of @xcite .",
    "we have repeated it here for the sake of completion .",
    "as in classical knot theory , the next consideration is how to characterize geometric mixed braids that induce via closure isotopic links in @xmath4 . for this purpose",
    "we need to recall the @xmath3-moves between braids .",
    "these were introduced in @xcite , and they generalize geometrically the markov moves in the following sense . an _",
    "@xmath48-move _ resp .",
    "_ @xmath49-move _ on a braid consists of cutting an arc open and splicing into the broken strand new arcs to the top and bottom , both _ over _ resp .",
    "_ under _ the rest of the braid ( see fig . 10 for the case of @xmath4 ) .",
    "as remarked in @xcite , using a small braid isotopy , a braid @xmath3-move can be equivalently seen with a crossing ( positive or negative ) formed ( see fig . 11 for @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , a geometric markov move in a braid , that introduces a crossing in the bottom right position , is a special case of an @xmath3-move .",
    "@xmath3-moves and braid isotopy generate an equivalence relation on braids called _ @xmath3-equivalence_. it was shown in @xcite that @xmath3-equivalent classes of braids are in bijective correspondence with isotopy classes of oriented links in @xmath1 , the bijection being induced by ` closing ' the braid . modified slightly , @xmath3-moves in a handlebody are defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath27 be a braid in @xmath4 and @xmath41 a point of an arc of the subbraid @xmath30 , such that @xmath41 is not vertically aligned with any crossing . doing a _ geometric @xmath3-move _ at @xmath41 means to perform the following operation : cut the arc at @xmath41 , bend the two resulting smaller arcs slightly apart by a small isotopy and stretch them vertically , the upper downwards and the lower upwards , and both _ over _ or _ under _ all other arcs of the diagram , so as to introduce two new corresponding strands with endpoints on the vertical line of @xmath41 , labelled ` o ' or ` u ' according to the stretching . stretching the new strands over will give rise to a _ geometric @xmath48-move _ and under to an _ geometric @xmath49-move_. undoing an @xmath3-move is defined to be the reverse operation .",

    "so closure is compatible with the @xmath3-move , and it corresponds to introducing a twist in the mixed link .",
    "we are now in a position to state the following .     two oriented links in @xmath4",

    "further , @xmath56 .",
    "this follows from definition 5 and from the fact that if we braid the closing arcs of a mixed braid , @xmath27 say , each closing arc will give rise to one pair of corresponding strands , so we obtain again the braid @xmath27 .",

    "it follows from remark 2 that @xmath58 is well - defined .",
    "thus , from the observations above , it only remains to show that @xmath57 is also well - defined , that is to show that geometric mixed braids corresponding to isotopic mixed links are @xmath3-equivalent . for this",
    "we apply the :    * relative version of markov theorem * ( theorem 4.7 of @xcite )  _ let @xmath18 , @xmath19 be oriented link diagrams in @xmath1 , both containing a common braided portion @xmath30 .",

    "markov equivalent_. a remark is now in order .    in the classical case in @xmath1 the braid move @xmath90 is equivalent to the move    @xmath91 where @xmath92",
    "this is still true in the case of a solid torus ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . to see this",
    "think that the infinite strand of a solid torus may be closed at the point at infinity , so any loop can conjugate with no obstruction . in @xcite ,",
    "lemma 39 , it is shown how to commute a loop from the bottom to the top of the braid without closing the infinite strand .",
    "but in a handlebody of genus greater than one this is not the case any more . here",
    "the braid word @xmath93 may contain more than one of the @xmath0 generators @xmath94 of the braid group ( recall fig .",
    "this is discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "there are two natural questions arising now :    * are there any ` hidden ' conjugations involving the generators @xmath94 , which preserve the isotopy class of the closure of a mixed braid ( even though the strands of @xmath10 do not participate in the closure ) ? * if yes , are all conjugations ` allowed ' ?    before answering we need to introduce another notion .",
    "a _ loop _ in @xmath2 is a word of the form @xmath95 or its inverse , for @xmath96 , and a _ maximal loop _ the word @xmath97 or its inverse ( see fig . 19 for illustrations ) .",
    "a maximal loop shall be denoted by @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99    fig . 19 . a loop and",
    "the two maximal loops .",
    "the answer to the first question is positive .",
    "indeed , we have :     let @xmath79 be arbitrary and let @xmath98 be a maximal loop .",
    "then the braids @xmath100 and @xmath101 are markov equivalent .    _",
    "proof . _ fig .",
    "20 demonstrates that , using algebraic @xmath3-moves and conjugation by a @xmath102 , the given algebraic mixed braids are markov equivalent by theorem 5 .",
    "thus their closures are isotopic",
    ". @xmath66    @xmath103    @xmath104    fig . 20 .",
    "the proof of lemma 3 .",
    "an alternative proof of lemma 3 would be to take the closures of @xmath105 and @xmath106 and to observe that a closing arc of @xmath107 can be dragged around to the left and all the way round to the position @xmath108    the answer to the second question is negative , as the example below shows : the two algebraic mixed braids of fig .",
    "21 are the algebraizations of the geometric mixed braids of fig .",
    "6 , thus their closures are the two non - isotopic mixed links of fig",
    ".    @xmath109    fig .",
    "two non - isotopic conjugate algebraic mixed braids .",
    "now a third question arises :    * can we list all the conjugations that are allowed with respect to isotopy ?    in order to answer this question we give first another presentation of the braid group @xmath2 with the @xmath110 s as generators .",
    "this presentation is easily derived from the one with the generators @xmath94 given in the previous section using that @xmath111    @xmath112    it is important to understand that _",
    "conjugation by some _",
    "@xmath110 of an algebraic mixed braid _ is equivalent to changing the labels _ of some pair of corresponding endpoints in a related geometric mixed braid .",
    "if , for example , the two corresponding endpoints of the geometric mixed braid lie to the left of all strands of @xmath10 , then by a braid isotopy part of which is absorbed inside the braid box , the geometric mixed braid can look like one of the middle pictures of fig . 22 .",
    "thus , change of labels corresponds to conjugating the algebraization of the ` o ' braid ( resp .",
    "the ` u ' braid ) by the loop @xmath113 ( resp .",
    "@xmath114 ) , as fig . 22 demonstrates .    @xmath115    fig",
    "conjugation by @xmath113 corresponds to allowed change of labels .    but",
    "these conjugations are allowed as we proved in lemma 3 .",
    "( to see the isotopy on the level of the geometric mixed braids look at the closing arc of the left middle braid of fig .",
    "this can pass from the ` u ' position to the ` o ' position without any obstruction from the braid . ) thus , change of labels in this case reflects isotopy between the closures of the two geometric mixed braids .",
    "let , now , the two corresponding endpoints of a geometric mixed braid lie between the @xmath116th and @xmath117st strand of @xmath15 for @xmath118 then , with similar reasoning as above , change of labels corresponds to conjugating the ` o ' braid ( resp .",
    "the ` u ' braid ) by the loop @xmath119 ( resp .",
    "@xmath120 ) , see fig . 23 . and",
    "conversely , two algebraic mixed braids that are conjugate by a @xmath121 with @xmath122 can be seen as the algebraizations of two geometric mixed braids which differ only by the labels of one pair of corresponding endpoints .",
    "but such a change of labels does not reflect isotopy . to see this ,",
    "think of the infinitely extended strands of @xmath10 joining at the point at infinity .",
    "then , the closing arc of the geometric ` u ' braid would have to cross the point at infinity in order to come to the ` o ' position",
    ". consequently conjugations by the @xmath110 s for @xmath123 are not allowed , except for some obvious special cases of disconnected diagrams , which would then imply that the knot can also live in a handlebody of smaller genus .",
    "@xmath124    fig .",
    "conjugation by @xmath125 corresponds to non - allowed change of labels .",
    "finally , the answer to the third question lies in the following result .",
    "conjugation by a maximal loop @xmath98 is the only conjugation by words in the @xmath110 s , which preserves the isotopy class in @xmath4 of the closure of _ any _ braid in @xmath126 that is , for any word @xmath127 in the @xmath110 s , different from @xmath128 for @xmath129 there is an @xmath130 such that @xmath131 and @xmath132 have non - isotopic closures .",
    "_ counter - examples of the required kind exist in the one - strand braid group @xmath133 .",
    "indeed , assume the theorem were false , i.e. the closures of @xmath134 and @xmath135 are isotopic , for all @xmath136 with @xmath106 a word in the @xmath110 s and @xmath137 some @xmath138 from theorem 4 we know that these two braids are related by braid isotopies and algebraic @xmath3-moves .",
    "since @xmath133 is the group generated by the @xmath110 s , and this is a free group , @xmath137 can not be commuted through @xmath106 .",
    "hence we have to invoke the @xmath3-moves .",
    "these introduce some @xmath139 s but they do not change the order of the @xmath110 s . according to the relations in the braid group , this can only be done if the condition @xmath140 is satisfied . but this is true always , only if @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , @xmath137 has to be @xmath113 or its inverse .",
    "thus , conjugation by @xmath142 for @xmath143 can not be realized in the generic case .",
    "topologically , this corresponds precisely to crossing the point at infinity discussed above .",
    "@xmath66    it is crucial for the whole study of braids in a handlebody to note that not all conjugations in the groups @xmath2 preserve the isotopy class of the closure of an algebraic mixed braid .",
    "theorem 6 disproves conjecture 4.4 in @xcite .",
    "theorem 5 opens up the possibility to define invariants of links in the handlebody by algebraic considerations .",
    "this runs largely in parallel with the derivation of link invariants in @xmath1 from markov traces , see for example @xcite . in the handlebody case",
    ", however , trace functionals are not appropriate because not all conjugations are allowed , see theorem 6 . hence , we have to modify the definitions , so as to take this into account .",
