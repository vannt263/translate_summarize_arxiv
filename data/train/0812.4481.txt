    "forty years ago , winfree pioneered the study of synchronization in large populations of coupled limit - cycle oscillators  @xcite .",
    "since then , the field has expanded considerably , thanks in large part to kuramoto s elegant reformulation  @xcite of winfree s intuitive model .",
    "both of their models were originally motivated by biological phenomena  @xcite such as the alpha rhythm of brain waves  @xcite , the collective firing of cardiac pacemaker cells  @xcite , the coordinated flashing of southeast asian fireflies  @xcite , menstrual synchrony among close female friends  @xcite , and glycolytic oscillations in yeast populations  @xcite .",
    "however , the techniques developed in analyzing these systems soon proved relevant to physical problems , including the dynamics of laser arrays  @xcite , charge - density waves  @xcite and coherence among sites of electrochemical dissolution  @xcite .    for simplicity ,",
    "all the individual oscillators in such models have often been assumed to be coupled equally strongly to all the others , a form of interaction known variously as global , infinite - range , or mean - field coupling .",
    "while this form of coupling is a crude approximation in most cases , series arrays of josephson junctions constitute a notable exception . in these systems , exact global coupling between the josephson junctions",
    "emerges naturally from kirchhoff s laws and the physical properties of weakly coupled superconductors  @xcite .    in the early 1990s , numerical simulations of josephson junction arrays",
    "revealed that they were prone to a large degree of neutral stability  @xcite .",
    "this peculiar phenomenon was first seen in a simple array in which @xmath0 identical junctions were connected in series and coupled by a resistor in parallel with all of them .",
    "the numerics suggested that the system s trajectories were always trapped on two - dimensional tori , no matter how many junctions were included in the array  @xcite .",
    "later studies showed that arrays of identical junctions coupled through other kinds of loads displayed a similarly non - generic form of behavior : all but four of the floquet multipliers for a certain periodic state known as a splay state appeared to lie on the complex unit circle and remain there as the system parameters were varied  @xcite .",
    "these and other puzzling observations were partially explained by the subsequent discovery that the equations of motion could be reduced to a dynamical system of much lower dimension  @xcite .",
    "specifically , watanabe and strogatz  @xcite found a time - dependent trigonometric transformation that expressed the junction phases in terms of @xmath0 constant phases and three collective time - dependent variables , each obeying a suitable differential equation .",
    "the transformation took the form @xmath2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\gamma(t)}{1-\\gamma(t ) } } \\tan\\left[\\frac{\\theta_j-\\theta(t)}{2}\\right]\\ ] ] for josephson junctions @xmath3 . here",
    ", the variables @xmath4 denote the junction phases , while the constants @xmath5 denote the fixed phases on which the transformation operates , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the collective variables .    in the limit of infinitely many josephson junctions",
    ", another result could be extracted from ( [ ws ] ) .",
    "the transformation maps old phases @xmath5 to new phases @xmath9 in such a way that a uniform distribution in @xmath10 , with phases spread evenly around the circle , is transformed into a non - uniform distribution in @xmath11 , with phases symmetrically clumped about some mean phase and distributed according to a poisson kernel .",
    "this result implies that the space of poisson kernels is dynamically invariant .",
    "the reasoning is as follows : if the phase distribution takes the form of a poisson kernel at any time , it can be viewed as having arisen ( via the transformation ) from an initially uniform phase distribution and hence will remain distributed as a poisson kernel for all time .",
    "recently , ott and antonsen  @xcite showed by explicit calculation that the submanifold of poisson - kernel phase distributions  henceforth called the _",
    "poisson submanifold_is invariant for a much wider class of models , including the kuramoto model and other systems in which the oscillators are non - identical . for the kuramoto model in which the oscillators have lorentzian - distributed natural frequencies ,",
    "ott and antonsen  @xcite derived an exact differential equation for the evolution of the complex order parameter ( the centroid of the phase distribution around the unit circle ) .",
    "as it happens , the amplitude and phase of the order parameter completely characterize the poisson kernel .",
    "hence , by extracting the dynamics of the order parameter , ott and antonsen  @xcite simultaneously unveiled the dynamics on the poisson submanifold .",
    "our goal in this paper is to use ott and antonsen s ansatz  @xcite to investigate the dynamics of series arrays of identical josephson junctions . before turning to this specific task",
    ", however , we first consider the scope of the ansatz itself .",
    "what algebraic form do the governing equations need to have in order for the ansatz to work ? in sec .",
    "[ reducible systems ] , we pinpoint the family of equations that can be simplified in this way , a family that includes josephson junction series arrays as a special case .    sections  [ resistively - loaded circuit ] and  [ rlc - loaded circuit ] then apply the ansatz to two particular arrays , one with a resistive load and another with an @xmath12 load .",
    "the analysis illuminates the order parameter dynamics on the entire poisson submanifold . in this way",
    ", we clarify for the first time how the associated arrays behave , not just near their equilibria and periodic orbits , but also far from those special states .    finally , sec .",
    "[ discussion ] discusses what the ansatz does  and does not  imply about the dynamics of the original josephson junction arrays .",
    "although the ansatz provides powerful insights , it does not tell the whole story ; it misses certain important dynamical states that lie off the submanifold of poisson kernels .",
    "these more general states can be handled by considering ( [ ws ] ) within the formalism of mbius transformations , as has recently been shown elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the most extensively studied systems of phase oscillators , from the kuramoto model to josephson junction arrays , involve purely sinusoidal interactions .",
    "this single - harmonic structure is the key to the success of the ott - antonsen ansatz  @xcite , as the following calculations show .",
    "consider a system of @xmath0 identical phase oscillators governed by @xmath13 for @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath14 is any smooth , complex - valued , @xmath15-periodic function of the phases @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath14 is allowed to depend on time and any other auxiliary state variables in the system ( for example , the charge on a load capacitor or the current through a load resistor for the josephson junction arrays discussed in sec .",
    "[ rlc - loaded circuit ] ) .",
    "what is crucial , however , is that @xmath14 must _ not _ depend on the oscillator index @xmath17 ; it must be the same function for all @xmath17 .",
    "likewise , the function @xmath18 must be independent of @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath18 has to be real - valued since @xmath19 is real .",
    "intuitively , the functions @xmath14 and @xmath18 can be regarded as common fields felt by all the oscillators .",
    "these fields might involve averages over all the phases , as in models with mean - field coupling , but this is not necessary .",
    "in fact , ( [ gov ] ) need not even have permutation symmetry .",
    "that is , the equations need not stay the same under an arbitrary interchange of indices , because the functions @xmath14 and @xmath18 need not respect such a symmetry .",
    "the only requirement is that @xmath14 and @xmath18 must be the same for all @xmath17 .",
    "the class of systems ( [ gov ] ) was studied previously by watanabe and strogatz  @xcite and by goebel  @xcite , who showed that all equations of this form are solved by the transformation ( [ ws ] ) , where the evolution of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is governed by the forms of @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",
    "we now show that the newly discovered ott - antonsen ansatz also works on this same class of systems , suggesting some intimate relationship between the two reduction methods , as addressed by  @xcite .",
    "the ott - antonsen ansatz is restricted to the infinite-@xmath0 limit of ( [ gov ] ) . in this limit",
    ", one describes the system not in terms of the motion of individual oscillators , but rather in terms of the evolution of the phase density @xmath23 , defined such that @xmath24 gives the fraction of phases that lie between @xmath11 and @xmath25 at time @xmath26 . then @xmath27 satisfies the continuity equation @xmath28 where the velocity field is @xmath29 from ( [ gov ] ) . here , in the case of infinite @xmath0 , our assumptions about the coefficient functions @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath18 take the form that @xmath14 and @xmath18 may depend on @xmath26 but not @xmath11 .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath18 can arise either explicitly ( through external forcing , say ) or implicitly ( through the time - dependence of the harmonics of @xmath27 or any auxiliary state variables in the system ) .",
    "next , following ott and antonsen  @xcite , suppose @xmath27 is of the form @xmath30 for some unknown function @xmath31 that is independent of @xmath11 .",
    "note that ( [ 5 ] ) is just an algebraic rearrangement of the usual form for the poisson kernel : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined via @xmath35 in geometrical terms , the ansatz ( [ 5 ] ) defines a submanifold in the infinite - dimensional space of density functions @xmath27 .",
    "this submanifold is two - dimensional and is parametrized by the complex number @xmath31 ( or equivalently , by the polar coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "we now show that the submanifold of poisson kernels is invariant and calculate the flow on it .",
    "to do so , we substitute the velocity field ( [ velocity ] ) and the ansatz ( [ 5 ] ) into the continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) . after reindexing where appropriate ,",

    ".  denotes the complex conjugate of the first term in ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "note the seemingly miraculous coincidence here : the expression in brackets is a common factor for each term in the sum .",
    "hence , although ( [ 8 ] ) constitutes an infinite set of amplitude equations , with one for each harmonic , all of them are satisfied simultaneously if the bracketed expression vanishes .",
    "this condition is also necessary , since @xmath37 thus ( [ 8 ] ) is satisfied for all @xmath11 if and only if @xmath38    it proves convenient to reexpress this result in terms of the complex order parameter @xmath39 , defined as usual by the centroid of the phase distribution : @xmath40 then by substituting ( [ 5 ] ) into ( [ z ] ) we find that @xmath41 .",
    "hence , @xmath39 satisfies the riccati equation @xmath42 this equation gives the flow on the poisson submanifold .",
    "when @xmath14 and @xmath18 are functions of @xmath39 and @xmath26 alone , as in the case that they can be expressed in terms of the harmonics of @xmath27 , ( [ riccati ] ) constitutes a closed two - dimensional system .",
    "we now apply ( [ riccati ] ) to obtain the reduced dynamics of the circuit shown in fig .",

    "there are many cases so we organize the calculations as a series of simple claims . readers who prefer to bypass the algebra can skip ahead to sec .  [ parameter space and phase portraits ] which summarizes the findings .",
    "first we convert ( [ 14 ] ) to cartesian coordinates .",
    "this removes the coordinate singularity at @xmath63 and permits simpler proofs of where the fixed points of ( [ 14 ] ) exist in the @xmath62-@xmath53 parameter space .",

    "the source current tunnels through each of the @xmath0 junctions without developing any voltage across the load .",
    "in contrast , the fixed points ( [ 16c ] ) and ( [ 16d ] ) have @xmath72 and lie inside the unit disk , meaning that the josephson junctions are not all in phase .",
    "this type of fixed point is known as a _ splay state _",
    "it represents a periodic collective state in which the junctions oscillate out of phase , but in such a highly organized way that the overall phase distribution remains stationary . in particular , the macroscopic order parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 stay constant even though individual junctions change their state non - uniformly , hesitating at some phases and accelerating at others .",
    "the stationary distribution of phases takes the form of a poisson kernel , as expected .",

    "its derivation gave the first explanation for why there are just four non - neutral floquet multipliers for the splay state of the @xmath12 system  @xcite .",
    "it also allowed analytical predictions of those multipliers  @xcite .",
    "however , the earlier derivation  @xcite involved fourier expansions of infinitesimal perturbations about the splay states , a procedure more complicated than the one given here .",
    "in retrospect , we can see now that perturbations tangent to the poisson submanifold are precisely those responsible for the non - neutral directions ; perturbations transverse to this manifold are the neutral ones .",
    "it is important to understand both the successes and the limitations of our analysis .",
    "the systems we have studied comprise a special class of josephson junction arrays , namely those in which all the junctions are identical and heavily overdamped , meaning that we can ignore their internal capacitance .",
    "the junctions are connected in series , driven by a constant bias current and coupled through a load in parallel . for this class of arrays ,",
    "it has been known since 1994 that the governing equations specify a family of low - dimensional invariant manifolds  @xcite . for resistively loaded arrays , these invariant manifolds are three - dimensional , while for arrays with an @xmath12 load , they are five - dimensional .",
    "these results hold for any number of junctions and extend to infinite @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we have shown that in the infinite-@xmath0 limit , the equations can be reduced even more dramatically . in other words , a strictly smaller invariant submanifold exists as a degenerate case of the invariant manifolds known previously .",
    "we have called it the poisson submanifold ; it consists of all phase distributions taking the form of a poisson kernel . using the ott - antonsen ansatz , we explicitly calculated the flow equations on this manifold , demonstrating in the process that the poisson submanifold is invariant .",
    "the resulting low - dimensional dynamical systems shed new light on the behavior of josephson junction series arrays .",
    "for example , earlier local arguments  @xcite showed that the synchronous periodic state and splay states for arrays with a resistive load exhibit neutral stability to linear order over a wide range of parameters .",
    "but do they exhibit neutral stability in nonlinear reality ?",
    "this has been a long - standing open question .",
    "we can now observe that the answer is yes .",
    "figure  [ phaseportraits](b ) shows that the splay state is surrounded by neutrally stable periodic orbits that fill the poisson submanifold , continuing all the way out to the synchronized orbit on the boundary of the disk .",
    "the other phase portraits in fig .",
    "[ phaseportraits ] similarly provide new information regarding the global structure .",
    "for example , they elucidate how splay states bifurcate with one another and with the synchronous periodic state and reveal global features such as the vertical heteroclinic orbit joining the in - phase rest states in several panels of figure  [ phaseportraits ] .",
    "previous global results regarding josephson junction arrays were confined to the averaged versions of such systems  @xcite , which were derived via perturbation methods in the limit of weak coupling or high bias current  @xcite .",
    "our results , by contrast , hold for all values of the circuit parameters .",
    "the trade - off is that they require infinite @xmath0 .",
    "however , the most serious drawback of our analysis is that it focuses on a thin slice of phase space which is unrepresentative of the dynamics of the full system .",
    "for instance , the poisson submanifold for the resistively loaded array is a degenerate , two - dimensional leaf in the foliation of phase space by three - dimensional invariant manifolds",
    ". could attractors or other interesting dynamical states exist off the poisson submanifold ?",
    "numerical simulations say yes :",
    "kam - like chaos occurs in the original equations for resistively loaded arrays  @xcite .",
    "the remaining challenge is then to show that the reduced equations faithfully capture this chaos on the larger invariant manifolds .",
    "we will address this issue in a subsequent paper  @xcite in which we use mbius transformations to simplify the circuit equations for josephson junction arrays .",
    "essentially the same idea has been developed independently by pikovsky and rosenblum  @xcite , who have obtained new results for the kuramoto model as well as more complex hierarchies of oscillators ."
