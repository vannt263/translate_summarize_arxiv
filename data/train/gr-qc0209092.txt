    "self - similar and spherically symmetric solutions play an important role in many areas of physics . in newtonian physics , using suitable space and time coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 , self - similarity is an ansatz @xmath4 for some field @xmath5 that is of interest . on the one hand , such an ansatz simplifies the field equations by eliminating one coordinate .",
    "( in spherical symmetry , in particular , the self - similar ansatz simplifies field equations that are partial differential equations in @xmath6 and @xmath3 to ordinary differential equations in one variable @xmath7 . ) on the other hand , self - similar solutions are often attractors , or intermediate attractors , and are therefore good approximations to _ generic _ solutions during some stage of their evolution .",
    "a classic example is the solution of the riemann problem in 1-dimensional fluid dynamics , where at @xmath8 the fluid has one constant velocity , density and entropy for @xmath9 , and another set of constant values for @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting shock solution is self - similar in the coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "the reason for self - similarity is that the initial data do not contain any length scale .",
    "the self - similar solution is a good approximation over an intermediate range of scales , larger than the molecular scale where the fluid assumption breaks down but smaller than the scale on which the solution varies smoothly .    in general relativity ,",
    "the most common definition of self - similarity is homotheticity : the spacetime admits a vector field @xmath12 with the property that the lie - derivative of the metric along this field is a constant times the metric : @xmath13 ( the choice of the constant as @xmath14 is a convention , the negative sign being chosen so that @xmath12 points towards increasing curvature . )",
    "this definition expresses the scale - invariance of the spacetime metric , and is analogous to the newtonian notion of self - similarity . with spherical symmetry",
    ", it is possible to introduce coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath6 so that all metric coefficients depend only on @xmath7 . in general relativity",
    ", self - similarity has an important application in gravitational collapse : during collapse whose initial data are close to the black hole threshold , certain self - similar `` critical '' solutions act as universal intermediate attractors    the continuous self - similarity ( css ) that we have discussed already can be generalized to a discrete self - similarity ( dss ) , in which @xmath15 depends arbitrarily on @xmath16 but can also depend on @xmath17 in a periodic manner , with some period @xmath18",
    ". clearly such solutions are scale - periodic rather than scale - invariant .",
    "several known critical solutions in gravitational collapse , in particular those with scalar field matter and in vacuum gravity , are dss rather than css . in this paper",
    "we are interested in perfect fluids , where the critical solutions are css , and from now on we restrict our discussion to this case .",
    "we refer to css when we specifically mean the continuous symmetry , and to self - similarity in any statements that are also true for dss .",
    "we proceed in three steps .",
    "we first discuss the kinematic consequences of css in spherical symmetry , generalizing the discussion in ori and piran @xcite and nolan @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the dynamics with perfect fluid matter and examine which of the kinematic possibilities are realized dynamically .",
    "we assume the linear barotropic equation of state @xmath19 , which is the only one that is compatible with exact self - similarity .",
    "we use the classification by carr and coley @xcite of all spherically symmetric css perfect fluid solutions to draw the corresponding conformal diagrams .",
    "finally , we look more closely at those solutions that appear as critical solutions in gravitational collapse .",
    "in this section we discuss the kinematics of spherical symmetry , without using the einstein equations .",
    "any spherically symmetric spacetime is naturally the product of a two - dimensional reduced spacetime @xmath20 crossed with the 2-sphere @xmath21 .",
    "any point in the reduced spacetime corresponds to a 2-sphere of area @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 transforms as a scalar on the reduced spacetime , and @xmath24 is a boundary of the reduced spacetime , which can either be a regular center or a central curvature singularity .",
    "a local mass function @xmath25 can be defined by @xmath26 .",
    "any point in the reduced spacetime where @xmath27 is timelike is a closed trapped surface in the full spacetime and a surface where @xmath27 is null is called an apparent horizon .",
    "we now restrict attention to spherically symmetric css spacetimes .",
    "the integral curves of the homothetic vector field ( homothetic lines ) provide a natural fibration of the 4-dimensional spacetime , and therefore a natural foliation of the reduced spacetime . labelling the integral curves",
    "provides a natural global coordinate on the reduced spacetime , which we shall call @xmath28 . in this paper",
    "we construct conformal diagrams for the reduced spacetime . apart from any singularities and conformal boundaries , lines of geometric significance include the homothetic lines , the lines of constant @xmath23 and the fluid world lines .",
    "we shall describe two building blocks from which any spherically symmetric css spacetime can be built .",
    "our arguments in this section are purely kinematic .",
    "they are therefore valid for any matter . on the other hand , for a given type of matter not",
    "every spacetime that can be assembled from the building blocks can be realized as a solution of the field equations .",
    "we illustrate this in section [ section : causal ] for perfect fluid matter .",
    "the key kinematic consequence of self - similarity in general relativity is the existence of a strong curvature singularity .",
    "it can be shown from ( [ css ] ) that in the direction @xmath12 any homothetic line runs into a curvature singularity in finite proper time , proper distance or affine parameter distance @xmath29 , unless the curvature vanishes identically on the curve @xcite . if the origin of @xmath29 is chosen so that the singularity is at @xmath30 , the kretschmann scalar scales as @xmath31 , the ricci scalar as @xmath32 and the mass as @xmath33 .",

    "the boundaries @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be either regular centers or central singularities . the manifold structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : manifold ] .",
    "it is important to note that this on its own does not determine the causal structure , but it does mean that all components of the singularity are connected",
    ". the usual conformal diagram of a closed friedmann universe with disjoint big bang and big crunch singularities , for example , can not be realized in a spherically symmetric css spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , fluid world lines can begin on one section of the singularity ( big bang ) and end on another ( black hole / big crunch ) .",
    "the difference is that in a spherically symmetric css solution these two components of the singularity must be connected either directly or through a null singularity .",
    "we obtain our two building blocks from considering radial null geodesics that are also homothetic lines .",
