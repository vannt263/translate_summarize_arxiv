    "the ground state @xmath0 can be expressed as a tn state ( matrix - product state in 1d and tensor - product state in 2d or higher ) , which can then be optimized either according to energy criterion , i.e. , minimal energy for ground state , or by a imaginary - time evolution which evolves from a random initial state gradually to the desired ground state of a given manybody hamiltonian , in 1d chains,@xcite 2d lattices,@xcite or infinite - dimensional bethe",
    "lattices.@xcite    apart from ground state properties , we are also interested in computing thermodynamic properties of quantum manybody systems , especially when a comparison or fitting between model simulation and experimental measurement is required .",
    "since any experimental measurement is performed at finite temperatures , a thermal tn ( ttn ) simulation is thus indispensable .",
    "in fact , when the temperature is sufficiently low , one can approximate well the ground state properties with low - temperature results ( see , for instance , sec . [",
    "sec : hubbardground ] below ) .",
    "more interestingly , some exotic thermal effects at low temperature , strongly affected by quantum fluctuations , can also be investigated by ttn calculations .",
    "for instance , a quantum critical point ( qcp ) will spread through a finite - temperature  critical \" region , where the thermal and dynamical properties are strongly influenced by the qcp.@xcite although the quantum phase transition is present only at absolutely zero temperature , and even does not lead to any  true \" phase transition at finite temperature , it could lead to some nontrivial consequences in this exotic region . to be more concrete , among others ,",
    "the entropy in response to external fields will show a singular behavior at critical point @xmath1 , resulting in a qcp - enhanced magnetocaloric effect ( mce).@xcite in the vicinity of qcp , the magnetic grneisen parameter @xmath2 measuring the mce , shows a diverging peak as temperature goes to zero , whose scaling behavior is intimately related to the quantum criticality.@xcite    in order to calculate the thermal properties with rg algorithms , one turns to density matrix @xmath3 describing a mixed state , instead of a pure state @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , the density matrix @xmath5 also bears a tn representation , and can be treated with tn - based algorithms .",

    "xiang and wang @xcite applied white s dmrg to the finite - temperature systems and developed the transfer - matrix renormalization group ( tmrg ) method .",

    "considering that the two directions of thermal tn are inequivalent , which is that the spatial direction is infinite while the thermometric axis is finite and subject to a periodic boundary condition , a quite natural contraction procedure is to contract the ttn linearly along the trotter direction .",
    "ltrg method can be used to accurately calculate the thermodynamics in 1d chains @xcite and also in higher dimensional lattices.@xcite    in this paper , we discuss a variant of the ltrg method , i.e. , bilayer ltrg ( for short , ltrg++ ) .",
    "ltrg++ can achieve a better accuracy than previous single - layer ltrg algorithm .",
    "furthermore , although being very different in the arithmetic level , ltrg++ is in essence equivalent to tmrg method , except that it is written in tn language and more straightforward to be implemented in practice .",

    ", constitute an important class of approaches .",
    "firstly , we review the tmrg algorithm in brief . as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ttn](b ) , the ttn can be decomposed into repeated 1d stripes , where the vertical stripe , denoted as transfer matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 , transfers the states @xmath21 s between different lattice sites . since @xmath22 , the transfer matrices @xmath23 are of great interest to us , whose dominant eigenvalue in the thermodynamic limit @xmath24 determines the free energy ( @xmath25 ) and thus other thermodynamic quantities of the 1d quantum system . in order to find this dominant eigenvalue ( and corresponding eigenvector ) , tmrg algorithm incorporates the dmrg method @xcite to solve the dominant eigenvalue problem in transfer matrix @xmath26 .",
    "the key idea of tmrg is to regard the transfer matrix @xmath26 as the  hamiltonian \" in ground state problem , perform  real space \" renormalization along the trotter direction , and truncate the accumulated @xmath27 indices into a fixed dimension .    , where @xmath28 constitutes an irreducible representation of @xmath29 symmetry .",

    "only a single mpo [ upper or lower one in fig .",
    "[ fig : ltrg++](a ) ] is involved in the process of contractions : starting from an identity mpo which represents the density matrix at infinite high temperature ( @xmath32 ) , and by continually projecting @xmath7 tensors onto the mpo , we cool down the system from @xmath32 to various lower temperatures , @xmath33 at @xmath17-th step , and renormalize @xmath5 with factor @xmath34 to regulate the elements with the largest norm in each local tensor ( of mpo ) as 1 . the thermodynamic properties can be computed at temperature @xmath35 by collecting these renormalization factors ( @xmath34 ) and by tracing the density matrix mpo ( @xmath5 ) . in particular",

    "an important technique in performing the contractions is to compress the exponentially proliferating bond dimensions of the mpo efficiently . during the process of projecting evolution operators",

    ", ltrg can cool down the system and produce quite accurate results of thermodynamic quantities even at quite low temperatures , with comparable precision to tmrg.@xcite",
    "in this section , we adapt the ltrg method , which was originally proposed for the infinite - chain system , to a finite - size system , and consider both single - layer and bilayer algorithms .",
    "in essence , the finite - size ltrg algorithm is a tensor - network description of the finite - temperature dmrg.@xcite similarly as in the infinite - chain ltrg , we start with preparing a thermal state at infinitely high temperature , which can be represented by mpo consisting of identity tensors and satisfies the canonical form .",
    "we can sequentially project tensor @xmath7 on it and generate the desire finite temperature state expressed in an mpo form , which can be traced to calculate the partition function , as well as other thermal properties .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the single - mpo finite - size ltrg algorithm is different from the finite - temperature dmrg introduced in ref .",
    ", in which a purified state in an enlarged hilbert space and its conjugate are involved . in the ttn language , this corresponds to a bilayer ltrg algorithm [ see fig . [",

    "it s interesting to find that the bilayer algorithm can produce more accurate result without further computational costs , and more astonishingly , even less than the single - layer one , considering the contraction of mpo with its conjugate is costly [ o(@xmath48 ) ] .",
    "the reason is that the canonical form of mpo actually saves us from actually doing this two - mpo contraction .",
    "as long as one keeps the canonical form of mpo during the process of projections , the tensor trace of mpo with its conjugate [ fig .",
    "[ fig : trmpo](c ) ] is just tracing the square of diagonal matrix @xmath49 , which is costless .",

    "are very similar , while they only differ in the contraction part . in single - layer method ,",
    "the mpo @xmath72 is prepared and directly traced as illustrated in fig .",

    "the former was implemented within the framework of traditional dmrg @xcite , while the latter is developed in the language of tensor networks .",
    "more importantly , the tmrg is firstly contracted along the spatial direction ( and then along the trotter direction ) , while in ltrg++ , the contraction is performed in the reversed order ( first trotter and then spatial directions ) . however , a careful analysis reveals that , in fact , these two algorithms are essentially equivalent , despite some minor difference in technical details .",
    "the key observation leading to this conclusion is that there indeed exists a hidden matrix product state ( mps ) in ltrg++ algorithm . in figs .",

    "[ fig - tad](a ) , we show the isentropes in the case of @xmath153 .",
    "the low - entropy curves all show dips around the saturation point @xmath143 , where a second - order qpt between sdw and saturated half - filled band takes place .",
    "this is a typical example showing that qpt can indeed expands into a quantum critical region [ see fig . [",

    ", we observe that -@xmath162 gradually approaches the the dashed line -@xmath163 , i.e. , the asymptotic limit that one can never go beyond .",
    "however , since our numerical simulation practically always has a lowest temperature @xmath164 ( in this work @xmath165 ) , our -@xmath166 curves terminate before it becomes too close to the asymptotic line , i.e. , the lower bound is -@xmath167 in the practical simulations .",
    "nevertheless , this asymptotic behavior is guaranteed to be the line isentropes must eventually follow , given that the entropy function @xmath168 is single valued .",
    "in addition , the isentropic contours of 1d ehm with @xmath169 are also shown in fig . [ fig - tad ] , from which one can also see a strong influence of first - order qpt on finite - temperature properties , i.e. , there also exists a significant change in the formal @xmath170 at phase transition points.@xcite however , in this case the number of fermions might change in the course of changing magnetic fields , which themselves carry entropies , and the electronic and magnetic entropies can no longer be clearly separated .",
    "therefore , it is tricky to define adiabatic temperature change in this grand canonical ensemble .",

    "this bilayer algorithm , for efficiently contracting the trotter - suzuki thermal tensor network , can be connected to several well - known algorithm , making it a very versatile tool and an unified framework to implement these algorithms .",
    "for instance , ltrg++ algorithm for finite - size system is a tensor network version of finite - temperature dmrg , and for infinite - size system ltrg++ is essentially equivalent to the tmrg method .",
    "we have also discussed the application of ltrg++ to fermionic systems , and employed it to accurately calculate the thermodynamics of a 1d extended hubbard chain .",
