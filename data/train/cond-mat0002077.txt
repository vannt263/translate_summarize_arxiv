    "tunneling measurements on htsc have revealed a rich variety of properties and characteristics [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "they may be classified according to their low and high energy features . with the low energy features we may attribute : ( i ) variable subgap shape of conductance , ranging from sharp , cusplike , to a flat , bcs - like feature [ 1 ] ; ( ii ) voltage and temperature dependence of quasiparticle conductivity [ 5,6 ] ; ( iii ) subgap structure [ 2 ] ; ( iv ) zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) [ 7 ] .",
    "the high energy features include : ( i ) asymmetry of conductance peaks [ 1],(ii ) van hove singularity ( vhs ) , ( iii ) conductance shape outside of the gap region ( background ( bg ) ) and its asymmetry [ 1 ] ; ( iv ) dip feature [ 8 ] ; ( v ) hump feature [ 8].these features are collected in schematic fig 1 .",
    "= 2.0 in    * fig.1 * schematic @xmath0-characteristic of nis - structure with the main features .",
    "[ fig1 ]    while the tunneling spectroscopy on conventional superconductors allows directly to find the energy gap of superconductor , the same measurements in htsc are not as easily interpreted .",
    "some times the same experiments on the same samples show different results [ 9 ] : cusplike or flat subgap feature , symmetric or asymmetric conductance peaks .",
    "usually the sharpest gap features are obtained when bg is weakly decreasing . a quantitative measure of it is the ratio of the conductance peak height ( ph ) to the background conductance : phb = ph / bg .",
    "when the bg conductance is decreasing , the @xmath1 , but when bg conductance is linearly increasing ( @xmath2v ) , @xmath3 .",
    "kouznetsov and coffey [ 10 ] and kirtly and scalapino [ 11 ] suggested that the linearly increasing bg is arising from inelastic tunneling .",
    "as was mentioned in [ 1 ] , the conductance is dominated by quasiparticle tunneling and that the effect of andreev reflection is not significant . a theoretical model for tunneling spectroscopy employing tight - binding band structure , @xmath4 gap symmetry , group velocity and tunneling directionality was studied by z. yusof , j. f. zasadzinski , l. coffey and n. miyahawa [ 1 ] .",
    "an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) band structure specific to optimally - doped bscco ( bi-2212 ) was used to calculate the tunneling density of states for a direct comparison to the experimental tunneling conductance .",
    "this model produces an asymmetric , decreasing conductance background , asymmetric conductance peaks and variable subgap shape , ranging from sharp , cusplike to a flat , bcs - like feature . a standard technique in analyzing the tunneling conductance is to use a smeared bcs function @xmath5 in which a scattering rate parameter ( lifetime broadening factor ) @xmath6 is used to take into account any broadening of the gap region in the dos .",
    "2 shows the dos calculated by formula ( 1 ) at @xmath7 mev and @xmath8 mev ( a ) , @xmath9 mev ( b ) and @xmath10 ( c ) .",
    "the characteristic features of the dos is the flat subgap structure at small @xmath6 .",
    "this method can not explain the asymmetry of the conductance peaks observed in the tunneling experiments .",
    "in the case of d - wave symmetry we have    s - wave dos at @xmath11 mev and different values of @xmath6 , calculated by formula ( 1 ) .",
    "d - wave dos at @xmath11 mev and different values of @xmath6 , calculated by formula ( 2 ) .    2 @xmath12    and dos calculated by this formula are presented in fig .",
    "the characteristic features of the dos is the cusplike subgap structure .",
    "as was mentioned in [ 1 ] this standard technique requires that the comparison be made with normalized tunneling conductance date , and since htsc tunneling conductance can exhibit a varied and complex background shape , this procedure may `` filter out '' too much information from the conductance data .",
    "an alternative is to simply normalize the data by a constant .    in [ 8 ]",
    "the tunneling data were first normalized by constructing a `` normal state '' conductance obtained by fitting the high bias data to a third order polynomial .",
    "the normalized conductance date were compared to a weighted momentum averaged d - wave dos @xmath13 here @xmath14 is an angular weighting function , which allows for a better fit with the experimental date in the gap region .",
    "a weighting function @xmath15 was used which imposed a preferential angular selection of the dos along the absolute maximum of the d - wave gap and tapers off towards the nodes of the gap .",
    "this is a rather weak directional function since the minimum of @xmath16 along the nodes of the d - wave gap is still none - negligible [ 8 ] .",
    "a. j. fedro and d. koelling [ 12 ] have done the modeling of the normal state and superconducting dos of htsc , using tight - binding band structure , including the next nearest neighbors @xmath17    the calculation showed two singularities in dos : a van hove singularity in the center of energy band due to saddle point near ( @xmath18,0 ) at @xmath19 and another at the lower edge of the energy band due to extra flattening out at ( 0,0 ) .",
    "as extended s - wave and d - wave superconducting dos were considered in case of hole - doped situation ( @xmath20 ) for different hole concentration .",
    "the fermi surface for @xmath19 and @xmath21 at the same concentration , corresponding @xmath22 which was used in [ 12 ] are presented in fig .",
    "it is needed to move up from the fermi surface ( set as the zero energy ) to reach the point ( @xmath18,0 ) in case @xmath19 and move down in case @xmath21 .",
    "so , for @xmath19 the fermi energy lies to the left of the van hove singularity and will move away from it with increased hole doping while for @xmath21 it lies to the right and will move towards to with increased hole doping ( see fig .",

    "the three dimensional graph of the coherence factor @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "since quasiparticles with momentum perpendicular to the barrier interface have the highest probability of tunneling , the tunneling matrix element @xmath46 reveals a need for factors of directionality @xmath47 and group velocity @xmath48 [ 1 ] .",

    "different factors may lead to the changing of the energy gap @xmath53 in htsc . in particular , strong effects are caused by nonmagnetic impurities [ 14 ] . in superconductors with d - wave symmetry the nonmagnetic impurities destroy the superconductivity very efficiently . possibility to destroy of cooper pairs by impurities leads to their finite lifetime .",
    "if the state with the quasiparticle is not stationary state , it must attenuate with time due to transitions to other states .",
    "the corresponding wave function has the form @xmath54 , where @xmath6 is proportional to the probability of the transitions to the other states .",
    "it may be interpreted as the energy of the quasiparticle has the imaginary addition @xmath55 .",

    "hence , the impurities lead to changing @xmath56 and we may do modeling of the influence of impurities on tunneling conductance by numerical calculation of dos n(e ) considering different values of @xmath56 in formula ( 6 ) . here",

    "the peculiarities of the quasiparticle energy spectrum ( 10 ) play an essential role in explanation of the conductance features . here ,",
    "based on the numerical calculation of dos we consider that the underlying asymmetry of the conductance peaks is primarily due to the features of quasiparticles energy spectrum .",

    "for clarity we present only three characteristic curves , which corresponds to @xmath65 with @xmath661 , 0.6 and 0.2 .",
    "we exclude the effects of group velocity and directionality to demonstrate that they are not responsible for peaks asymmetry .",
    "there is the asymmetry of the quasiparticle peak heights as for s- and d - wave symmetry .",

    "the position of the quasiparticle peaks is constant excluding the direction along @xmath69 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we pay attention to the strong peaks asymmetry in this case .",
    "in the case of d - wave symmetry we have practically the same behavior around @xmath69 direction as for s - wave , but energy gap is changed due to the @xmath71-dependence of @xmath56 and correspondingly , the quasiparticle peaks are shifted to the zero energy .    fig.13 shows the @xmath45-changing of dos at @xmath9 mev ( a , c ) and @xmath8 mev ( b , d ) as for s - wave ( a , b ) and d - wave ( c , d ) gap symmetry .",
    "the increase of @xmath45 means the taking into play ( inclusion ) the states , close to ( @xmath73 ) .",

    "the vhs is more pronounced in case of d - wave in comparing with s - wave symmetry .",
    "the increase of @xmath6 leads to confluence of the quasiparticle and vhs peaks .",
    "we consider that the absence vhs peak on the experimental @xmath74-characteristics means the enough large lifetime broadening factor @xmath6 in that htsc material .",
    "the origin of the peaks asymmetry in the tunneling dos was studied in [ 1 ] by considering the role of the tunneling matrix element @xmath46 in the clean limit case ( @xmath10 ) , where for the calculation n(e ) was used the formula ( 5 ) .",
    "we repeat the explanation of the paper [ 1 ] because we believe that the following conclusion on the origin of the peaks asymmetry must be different . at @xmath75 ( positive bias voltages )",
