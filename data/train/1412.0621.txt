    "the variability at annual , interannual and decadal time scales of the coupled ocean  atmosphere system is currently a central concern in improving extended - range weather and climate forecasts . the oceans long - term variability and",
    "their interaction with the atmosphere has been extensively explored in the tropical pacific , due to the climatological importance of the el nio  southern oscillation ( enso ) phenomenon ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ocean and the atmosphere also interact in the mid - latitudes through both wind stress and buoyancy fluxes @xcite ) , although the impact of this interaction on the long - term variability of the atmosphere is still controversial @xcite .    on physical grounds ,",
    "interactions between the two components of the coupled climate system in mid - latitudes are obviously essential to its functioning on multiple time scales .",
    "the main direction of the coupling , however , is a matter of debate : is the slower ocean responding to the wind stress forcing in an essentially passive way @xcite  i.e. , is its feedback to the atmosphere too weak to qualitatively modify the dynamics of a stand - alone atmosphere  while , at the same time , playing the role of a heat bath that provides boundary forcing for the atmosphere @xcite ? or is the ocean playing a more active role in atmospheric dynamics @xcite ?",
    "@xcite , for instance , discuss these questions in detail .    from a dynamical point of view ,",
    "one possible answer to these questions translates into a search for the presence of coupled modes between the ocean and the atmosphere , such as found for instance in observational data @xcite . in the context of coupled global climate models ,",
    "the answer , however , differs from one investigation to another or from a modeling setup to another ; this answer depends , to a large extent , on whether the forcing is generated by deterministic or stochastic , linear or nonlinear processes @xcite .",
    "part of our motivation is that a low - frequency nonlinear oscillation has been found in intermediate - order , coupled nonlinear ocean - atmosphere models .",
    "this coupled mode operates by triggering the displacement of the atmospheric jet position @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of this coupled mode is , however , not fully understood as yet , nor is its existence generally agreed upon .    to understand the qualitative behavior of the coupled ocean ",
    "atmosphere dynamics , several low - order models have been developed .",
    "such models allow one to isolate the essential processes believed to be at play in a specific problem at hand , by using as building blocks only the minimal ingredients describing the dynamics .",
    "this approach  originating in the works of saltzman @xcite and lorenz @xcite and , from then on , in the development and applications of nonlinear dynamics to the environmental sciences  attempts to reduce complicated dynamics to its essential features .",
    "it has been quite successful , so far , in increasing our understanding of the dynamics of the ocean alone , in particular the multimodality of the thermohaline circulation @xcite , as well as the development and variability of the mid - latitude oceanic gyres @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "it is lorenz @xcite who applied this approach first to the coupled system and developed a pseudo - spectral , low - order model based on the primitive equations for the atmosphere , coupled to an ocean heat bath .",
    "vannitsem @xcite used this model to evaluate the impact of climate changes on model error biases .",
    "nese and dutton @xcite extended the model by adding an ocean dynamics similar to the one proposed by @xcite and based on four dominant ocean modes .",
    "these authors found that accounting for the heat transport helps increase the coupled model s predictability .",
    "other minimal - order coupled models @xcite allowed for the possibility of the ocean s developing a thermohaline circulation . in the latter work , @xcite performed a bifurcation analysis and showed the active role of the ocean in setting up the dynamics when close to the bifurcation points of the atmospheric model .",
    "while @xcite did not consider full coupling , they did point out some of the similarities between the bifurcation trees of the atmospheric and oceanic dynamics in a mid - latitude setting .",
    "more recently , vannitsem and colleagues @xcite have developed two coupled model versions based on a quasi - geostrophic atmospheric model proposed by @xcite and further studied in @xcite , and on the ocean model of @xcite .",
    "the coupling in both of these versions was based solely on a mechanical transfer of momentum via wind friction .",
    "in particular , these authors showed that their coupled model displays decadal variability within the ocean , similar to that found in idealized , intermediate @xcite and low - order models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the investigation of this coupled model s stability properties showed that the momentum transfer coupling between the two components contributes to an increase of the flow s instability , in terms of both the magnitude of the positive lyapunov exponents and their number .",
    "this model @xcite is , however , missing an important ingredient of the coupled dynamics , namely the energy balance between the ocean and the atmosphere .",
    "the present work proposes a new model version , in which the thermal forcing affecting only the atmosphere is replaced by an energy balance scheme @xcite .",
    "it will allow us to disentangle the respective roles of the heat and radiative fluxes through the ocean surface vs. the transport of heat within the ocean in affecting the coupled system and its predictability .",
    "the model equations are described in section [ sec : dyn ] , for the dynamics @xcite and thermodynamics , respectively ; they are reduced to a low - order system in section  [ sec : low - dim ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , a bifurcation analysis of the basic solutions is first performed ( section  [ ssec : bifn ] ) ; it reveals the presence of low - frequency variability ( lfv ) in the form of a set of long - periodic , attracting orbits that couple the dynamical modes of the ocean and the atmosphere .",
    "the model dynamics is further explored through the analysis of the climatological properties of the solutions in section  [ ssec : clim ] , while the dependence of the decadal - scale orbits on model parameters and their predictability are studied in sections  [ ssec : slow_mfd ] and [ ssec : lyap ] , respectively .",
    "a summary of the results and future prospects are then provided in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the atmospheric model is based on the vorticity equations of a two - layer , quasi - geostrophic flow defined on a @xmath0-plane @xcite .",
    "the equations in pressure coordinates are @xmath1 here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the streamfunction fields at 250 and 750 hpa , respectively , and @xmath4 is the vertical velocity , @xmath5 is the coriolis parameter at latitude @xmath6 , with @xmath7 its meridional gradient there .    the coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath9 multiply the surface friction term and the internal friction between the layers , respectively , while @xmath10 hpa is the pressure difference between the two atmospheric layers .",
    "an additional term has been introduced in this system in order to account for the presence of a surface boundary velocity of the oceanic flow defined by @xmath11 ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "this would correspond to the ekman pumping on a moving surface and is the mechanical contribution of the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere .",
    "equation has been nondimensionalized , as discussed in [ ssec : nondim ] .",
    "the ocean model is based on the reduced - gravity , quasi - geostrophic shallow - water model on a @xmath0-plane ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath12 here @xmath11 is the streamfunction in the model ocean s upper , active layer , which has density @xmath13 , depth @xmath14 , and lies over a quiescent deep layer with density @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is referred to as the reduced gravity felt by the fluid in the active layer , and @xmath17 is the reduced rossby deformation radius .",
    "the friction coefficient at the bottom of the active layer is @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the vertical component of the curl of the wind stress .",
    "usually , in low - order ocean modeling , this curl is prescribed as an idealized profile , zero along a latitude @xmath6 placed at or near 45@xmath20n , and antisymmetric about this latitude @xcite . in the present work , this forcing is provided by the wind stress generated by the atmospheric component of the coupled system .    assuming that the wind stress is given by @xmath21  where @xmath22 are the horizontal components of the geostrophic wind , and @xmath23 the corresponding components of the geostrophic currents in the ocean  one gets @xmath24 here the wind stress is proportional to the relative velocity between the flow in the ocean s upper layer and the wind in the lower atmospheric layer .",
    "the drag coefficient @xmath25 characterizes the strength of the mechanical coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere and will be a key bifurcation parameter in the present work .",
    "equation is also made nondimensional , cf .",
    "[ ssec : nondim ] .",
    "we assume here that temperature is a passive scalar transported by the ocean currents , but the oceanic temperature field displays strong interactions with the atmospheric temperature through radiative and heat exchanges @xcite . under these assumptions ,",
    "the evolution equation for the ocean temperature is    @xmath26    with @xmath27    in eqs .   and above",
    ", @xmath28 is the net radiative flux at the ocean surface .",
    "this flux contains three terms : the shortwave radiation @xmath29 entering the ocean ; the outgoing longwave radiation flux @xmath30 ; and the longwave radiation flux @xmath31 re - emitted to the ocean ; here @xmath32 is the emissivity of the atmosphere and @xmath33 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is the heat capacity of the ocean , and @xmath35 is the heat transfer coefficient between the ocean and the atmosphere that combines both the latent and sensible heat fluxes .",
    "we assume that this combined heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference between the atmosphere and the ocean .",
    "the typical values of the above parameters are provided in table  [ tab : dim_param ] .",
    "let us now consider the equation for the temperature of the baroclinic atmosphere presented in section  [ ssec : atmos ] . as in the ocean , a radiative and heat flux scheme is incorporated reflecting the exchanges of energy between the ocean , the atmosphere and outer space @xcite :    @xmath36    with @xmath37    in eq .",
    "[ eq : heat_atm ] , @xmath38 is the atmospheric barotropic streamfunction , @xmath39 is the net radiative flux in the atmosphere , @xmath40 the gas constant , @xmath41 the vertical velocity in pressure coordinates , and @xmath42 is the static stability , with @xmath43 the pressure , @xmath44 the air density , and @xmath45 the specific heat at constant pressure ; here @xmath46 is taken to be constant .",
    "note also that , thanks to the hydrostatic relation in pressure coordinates and to the ideal gas relation @xmath47 , the atmospheric temperature @xmath48 can be expressed as @xmath49 .    as for the radiative flux in the ocean , in eqs .   and , the net radiative flux @xmath39 within the atmosphere is composed of three terms : the ingoing flux @xmath50 of radiative energy effectively absorbed ; the outgoing flux @xmath51 re - emitted to the ocean and to space ; and the shortwave radiative flux @xmath52 absorbed directly by the atmosphere .",
    "note that , in writing eqs . and",
    ", we assume that the rates of radiative emission and absorption are equal , i.e that emissivity is equal to absorptivity .",
    "this assumption is strictly valid only at thermodynamic equilibrium , but it can be safely applied to systems in local thermodynamic equilibrium , like the lower atmosphere , in which molecular collisional processes dominate the radiative processes @xcite .",
    "this expression for @xmath48 can then be used to combine eqs .   and , as done when deducing the quasi - geostrophic potential vorticity equation @xcite .      in order to build a low - order model version ,",
    "we follow the truncated fourier expansion approach in @xcite , i.e. , the model fields are developed in a series of basis functions and truncated at a minimal number of modes that still captures key features of the observed behavior .",
    "both linear and nonlinear terms in the equations of motion are then projected onto the phase subspace spanned by the modes retained , by using an appropriate scalar product .    in the thermodynamic equations introduced in sections [ ssec : ocean_temps ] and [ ssec : atmos_temps ]",
    ", quartic terms appear in the radiative fluxes . to overcome this problem",
    ", we will take advantage of the small amplitude of temperature anomalies , as compared with the global mean , in order to linearize these terms .",
    "the details of this linearization are described in [ ssec : linearize ] .",
    "for the model s closed ocean basin , we use only sine functions , in order to avoid fluxes through the boundaries . for the atmosphere ,",
    "no - flux boundaries are assumed in the meridional direction and periodicity in the longitudinal direction .",
    "hence both sine and cosine functions are allowed in the longitudinal direction , while we use cosine modes only in the meridional direction , as discussed for instance in @xcite .",
    "the radiative fluxes are taken as proportional to a cosine function of latitude .    to obtain the coupled - model equations for the atmosphere , we combine the truncated temperature equations   of [ ssec : appendix ] with the equations for the atmospheric streamfunction perturbation that result from the projection of the dynamical equations onto the modes in the set  . as in @xcite ,",
    "one obtains a set of @xmath53 ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the atmosphere .",
    "similarly , combining the projection of the streamfunction field for the ocean onto the modes of with the temperature field of ( [ eq : temp_set_oc_de_1 ] ) leads to a set of @xmath54 odes , cf .",
    "[ ssec : appendix ] .",
    "the full coupled model is thus based on a set of @xmath55 odes .",
    "the time - dependent solutions of this system are obtained by numerical integration , using a second - order heun method with a fixed time step @xmath56 time units .",
    "several higher - accuracy methods have been tested but without affecting substantially the results reported herein .    in our analysis of the dynamics of the coupled system",
    ", we will mostly focus on three parameters , given in dimensional units , in order to ascertain the typical values that give rise to remarkable behavior .",
    "these three parameters are @xmath57 [ wm@xmath58 , @xmath59  [ s@xmath60 $ ] and @xmath35 [ wm@xmath61k@xmath62 : they correspond to the meridional variation in the radiative input from the sun ; the strength of the coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere , as an inverse of a response time scale ; and the intensity of the heat fluxes , respectively .",
