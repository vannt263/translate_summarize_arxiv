    "kinetic theory is an everlasting contribution of ludwig boltzmann to physics .",
    "while he devised the theory to understand the dynamics of dilute gases , the method as such is much more general and has been applied with great success in many areas .",
    "a more recent example is the flow of granular media .",
    "their defining property are inelastic collisions .",
    "thus a natural , in fact highly informative , approach is to follow the route of kinetic theory , adjusting for the appropriate collision mechanism @xcite .    in the early days of kinetic theory it was a convoluted process to understand that the boltzmann equation can not possibly hold for every mechanical initial condition . but to set forward the proposition that the boltzmann equation becomes exact in a particular limiting procedure , now called the boltzmann - grad limit @xcite , took almost 80 years counted from boltzmann s 1872 paper . in this limit",
    "the sometimes painfully vague notions of `` overwhelming probability '' and the like acquire a definite meaning .",
    "for example , the set of exceptional initial phase points has a measure ( w.r.t . the initial measure on phase space ) which tends to zero in the boltzmann - grad limit .",
    "grad s proposition was proved as a mathematical theorem by lanford @xcite , see @xcite for more expanded discussions .",
    "given the example of low density gases , one might wonder whether similar ideas are applicable to further microscopic systems .",
    "the landau equation for weakly interacting particles and the vlasov equation for weak , long range forces are examples from plasma physics . after the advent of quantum mechanics , an obvious task was to also adjust kinetic theory . for electrons , satisfying fermi - dirac statistics ,",
    "the generalization was accomplished by nordheim @xcite , for the quantized wave equation ( phonons ) by peierls @xcite , and for dilute quantum gases by uehling and uhlenbeck @xcite .    the derivation of the boltzmann equation for interacting quantum particles is well covered in recent articles @xcite . here",
    "i summarize the current status for weakly nonlinear wave equations with random initial data .",
    "on the surface this problem looks simpler than weakly interacting quantum particles , since there is no need for operators , fock spaces , and the like . on the other hand , at least on the level of time - dependent perturbation theory ,",
    "the wave equation and quantum systems have similar feynman diagrams .",
    "in particular cases the wave diagrams are a proper subset of the set of all quantum diagrams . as a consequence",
    "the limiting kinetic equations differ only minimally . for the kinetic description a dividing line seems to be point particles versus wave equation , the latter case being much less understood because of the nonlocal interaction once the dynamics",
    "is expressed in terms of multi - point wigner functions .",
    "writing down a kinetic equation always involves some modeling aspects .",
    "the available experience provides sufficient guidance as to what would constitute an acceptable kinetic equation .",
    "there is then no point in waiting for a firm microscopic derivation .",
    "rather more urgently is to work out predictions from the kinetic equation , which by itself is a demanding endeavour .",
    "in fact , a kinetic equation to be exact in a particular limit might very well be exceptional .",
    "a prominent example are lattice boltzmann algorithms , which are used widely to simulate flows in complicated geometries and close to reacting surfaces . for such algorithms",
    "the boltzmann equation remains as an approximation , although a very powerful one .    to give a brief outline , in the following section we explain , what i call , the kinetic framework .",
    "physicists tend to be more computationally oriented and the underlying statistical properties of the microscopic system are rarely spelled out in full detail .",
    "but on a conceptual level the kinetic framework is most useful and , assuming it to hold , the kinetic equation is obtained rather easily .",
    "we emphasize that the kinetic framework is not restricted to a particular model .",
    "it is a general structure , which can be used whenever a splitting into a `` free '' part and an appropriately small perturbation is meaningful . in section [ sec.3 ]",
    "we write down the phonon boltzmann equation in case of a quartic potential .",
    "some of the basic properties of this equation are discussed in section [ sec.4 ] .",
    "perhaps somewhat unexpected , the kinetic approach yields interesting dynamical information even for an anharmonic chain .",
    "in this light we revisit the famous fermi - pasta - ulam problem .",
    "we plan to study the scalar wave equation in three space dimensions with a cubic nonlinearity of the form @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the wave field , @xmath2 the laplacian , and @xmath3 , but small .",
    "the initial data are random and of finite energy .",
    "as will be explained , the total energy is taken to be of order @xmath4 and the support of @xmath5 of linear extent @xmath6 . to avoid the issue of ultraviolet divergencies , eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) is discretized spatially through the standard grid @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to also allow for a general dispersion relation of the linear part .",
    "physically , the discretized wave equation describes the lattice dynamics of dielectric crystals , see @xcite for systematic expositions . in this context",
    "the scalar equation would correspond to a one - band approximation .",
    "fourier transform will be a convenient tool .",
    "let @xmath8 ^ 3 $ ] be the first brillouin zone of the lattice dual to @xmath7 . for @xmath9 its fourier transform , @xmath10 ,",
    "is defined by @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath10 extends periodically to a function on @xmath13 .",
    "the inverse fourier transform is given by @xmath14    for @xmath15 the displacement away from @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath17 and the corresponding momentum by @xmath18 . in the harmonic approximation the interaction potential is @xmath19 the elastic constants @xmath20 satisfy @xmath21 for suitable @xmath22 .",
    "mechanical stability requires @xmath23 in fact , we assume @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the case @xmath26 for small @xmath27 is refered to as ` acoustical ' while @xmath28 is ` optical ' .",
    "the dispersion relation of the harmonic part is @xmath29    following ( [ 2.1 ] ) as a concrete example , we consider a quartic on - site potential .",
    "then the full hamiltonian of the lattice dynamics is given by @xmath30 the harmonic part of @xmath31 will be denoted by @xmath32 , @xmath33 . in a sense to be explained below , @xmath34 is a `` small '' perturbation of @xmath32 .",
    "we concatenate @xmath35 and @xmath36 into a single complex - valued field @xmath37 as @xmath38 with the inverse @xmath39 then the hamiltonian reads @xmath40 @xmath41 hence the equations of motion for the @xmath42-field are @xmath43 in particular for @xmath44 , @xmath45    let us now briefly recall the case of dilute gases .",
    "the central quantity is the boltzmann @xmath46-function , which is the number density on one - particle phase space @xmath47 .",
    "it changes in time by the free motion of particles and through pair collisions , @xmath48 we do not write out the collision operator explicitly but note that it is bilinear in @xmath49 and strictly local in the space - variable @xmath50 , since on the kinetic scale particles collide at the same point . at low density",
    "the full particle statistics is close to poisson , jointly in positions and velocities , with an intensity given again by the @xmath46-function .",
    "this double meaning of the @xmath46-function is a source of conceptual confusion . in the stozahlansatz",
    "one assumes independent incoming velocities , thus the second meaning of @xmath46 , while the predictions of kinetic theory are based on a law of large numbers , thus the first meaning of @xmath46 .",
    "the poisson statistics appears naturally through the good statistical mixing properties of the collisionless dynamics .",
    "in fact , at infinite volume , these are the only translation invariant measures , which are invariant under the collisionless dynamics and which have a finite number , energy , and entropy per unit volume @xcite",
    ".    for wave equations the poisson measure will be substituted by a gaussian measure , constrained to be locally invariant under the dynamics generated by @xmath32 . in",
    "the _ spatially homogeneous _ case , imposing time - stationarity and using the explicit solution ( [ 2.13a ] ) for @xmath44 , the @xmath51 , @xmath52 are then jointly gaussian with mean zero and covariance @xmath53 @xmath54 defining the power spectrum @xmath55 .",
    "clearly , @xmath56 .    for the _ spatially inhomogeneous _ case",
    "the construction is slightly more elaborate .",
    "since the anharmonic potential is of order @xmath57 , the mean free path for phonons is of order @xmath6 .",
    "this is the scale on which spatial inhomogeneities have to be imposed .",
    "local stationarity still implies mean zero and ( [ 2.16 ] ) . for the covariance ( [ 2.15 ] ) we first prescribe the limiting local power spectrum @xmath58 with @xmath59 and a rapid decay in position space .",
    "in analogy to the semiclassical limit of the schrdinger equation we refer to @xmath60 as wigner function .",
    "a _ locally stationary _ gaussian measure , denoted by @xmath61 , is in fact a scale of probability measures depending on @xmath62 .",
    "for each @xmath62 the measure @xmath61 is gaussian with @xmath63    following wigner the local power spectrum of the @xmath42-field is defined through @xmath64 we rescale the lattice to have lattice spacing @xmath62 through the substitution @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and obtain the rescaled local power spectrum @xmath67 @xmath68 is a random field . by definition ,",

    "unavoidably there will be small errors . to allow for them we call an arbitrary sequence of probability measures , @xmath75 ,",
    "_ locally stationary _ , if the gaussian property is gained only in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "more precisely , for our model we may assume that all odd moments of @xmath75 vanish , since this property is propagated in time .",
    "for the second moments @xmath77 , @xmath78 we form the rescaled one - particle wigner function as in ( [ 2.19 ] ) , ( [ 2.20a ] ) .",
    "the rescaled wigner function for @xmath79 is assumed to vanish as @xmath76 , while the rescaled wigner function for @xmath80 satisfies ( [ 2.20 ] ) .",
    "( [ 2.21a ] ) is imposed correspondingly .",
    "in addition we require that the sequence of local measures , close to @xmath81 [ lattice units ] , converges to a gaussian measure with covariance ( [ 2.15 ] ) , ( [ 2.16 ] ) and @xmath55 replaced by @xmath82 .",
    "from ( [ 2.20 ] ) we infer that for a locally stationary measure it holds @xmath83 the harmonic energy is extensive . on the other hand the average anharmonic potential satisfies @xmath84 , which is small compared to @xmath85 .",
    "our real goal is to understand the time evolution in the limit of small @xmath62 .",
    "we impose the initial measure to be gaussian and locally stationary . as a simple , but useful first step we set @xmath86 and , for a short intermediate stretch only , consider the linear dynamics generated by @xmath32 . by linearity",
    "this dynamics preserves the gaussian property .",
    "since the initial state has a slow variation on the scale @xmath6 , the limit @xmath76 for the one - particle wigner function is a particular case of the semiclassical limit for a linear wave equation .",
    "thus the appropriate time scale is also of order @xmath6 and on that scale @xmath87 ( on the left hand side @xmath88 is the time in microscopic units , the units of ( [ 2.13 ] ) , while on the right hand side @xmath89 refers to kinetic times , the units for ( [ 2.14 ] ) ) .",
    "the limit wigner function is governed by the transport equation @xmath90 which corresponds to the free motion of fictiuous particles , the phonons , with kinetic energy @xmath91 .",
    "of course , ( [ 2.23 ] ) has to be solved with the initial condition @xmath92 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a complete coverage of the semiclassical limit for lattice dynamics with an arbitrary unit cell .",
    "random initial data are studied in @xcite , where only rather mild mixing conditions on the initial measure @xmath75 are imposed .",
    "let @xmath93 be the measure at time @xmath89 as evolved according to the dynamics generated by @xmath32 .",
    "it is proved that for any @xmath94 the sequence of measures @xmath95 is locally stationary with a wigner function satisfying the transport equation ( [ 2.23 ] ) . in this sense local stationarity",
    "is dynamically generated .",
    "such results require , as does the kinetic limit , that phonons propagate with nonzero velocity .",
    "to say one has to demand that @xmath96 a.s .. by our assumption , @xmath97 is real analytic on @xmath98 and one only has to exclude the case @xmath99 _ const _ .. nevertheless , since momentum space is @xmath98 , there will always be submanifolds where @xmath100 , which sets an extra technical difficulty .",
    "we return to the case of interest , namely adding the anharmonicity @xmath34 .",
    "then , if as before the initial measure is required to be gaussian and locally stationary , the time - evolved measure @xmath101 is no longer gaussian . on the other hand",
    ", the linear dynamics does not tolerate deviations from gaussianity , as demonstrated in @xcite , and the strength of the anharmonicity is taken to be small .",
    "thus the family @xmath102 is still locally stationary .",
    "of course now @xmath55 depends on @xmath50 and @xmath89 [ kinetic scale ] .",
    "the precise strength of the anharmonic on - site potential is adjusted such that its effect is of order 1 for the scale on which ( [ 2.23 ] ) holds .",
    "more physically speaking , the interaction strength is such that the phonon mean free path is of order @xmath6 [ lattice units ] .",
    "thus one expects the limit ( [ 2.22 ] ) still to be valid .",
    "only the transport equation picks up a term resulting from the collisions between phonons .",

    "the encircled set is supposed to represent the set of `` all '' probability measures for the random field @xmath37 .",
    "we fix the interaction strength as @xmath105 .",

    "the hamiltonian dynamics generates a flow on the space of measures .",
    "the set @xmath106 is attractive , in the sense that fairly rapidly , times of order 1 , the measure will be close to @xmath106 . on @xmath106",
    "the time evolution is slow with changes on the kinetic scale @xmath107 and the defining wigner function is governed by a kinetic equation . for @xmath108 further dynamical phenomena set in which can not be captured through the kinetic framework .",
    "the kinetic framework provides us with a tool for an educated guess on the form of the collision operator .",
    "an important check will be that the resulting equation has the physically correct stationary solutions and satisfies an @xmath31-theorem for the total entropy , respectively a local semi - conservation law with a positive entropy production .",
    "a more demanding issue is to support the educated guess by mathematical arguments which establish the assumed existence of limits and local stationarity .",
    "let @xmath109 denote the measure at time @xmath89 under the dynamics generated by @xmath31 with @xmath110 .",
    "the two - point function satisfies @xmath111 @xmath112 is cubic in the @xmath42-field .",
    "we integrate ( [ 2.13 ] ) in time , symbolically @xmath113 and insert ( [ 3.2 ] ) in the expression for @xmath112 .",
    "there are then cubic terms , proportional to @xmath57 , which vanish upon averaging , and sixtic terms , proportional to @xmath62 . at this point",
    "we use , as argued , that locally the measure is approximately gaussian and factorize the 6-point function according to the gaussian rule for moments .",
    "we also rescale space - time by @xmath6 and switch to wigner function coordinates . in this form",
    "one can take the limit @xmath76 .",
    "the first term on the right of ( [ 3.1 ] ) yields the free flow while @xmath114 results in the collision operator with a cubic nonlinearity .",
    "details of such computations can be found in @xcite .",

    "the term proportional to @xmath60 is the loss term .",
    "it has no definite sign . on the other hand",
    "the gain term @xmath123 is always positive , ensuring that the positivity of the initial wigner function is propagated in time .    as a historical parenthesis we remark that in his seminal paper peierls uses a very different reasoning .",
    "the current method goes back to the mid - fifties where green s function techniques were developed systematically along the lines set forth by quantum field theory .",
    "the textbook expositions of the phonon boltzmann equation are not so satisfactory , at least in solid state physics . for the quantized theory fermi s golden rule",
    "is applied in a spatially homogeneous , discrete mode context .",
    "while this gives the correct collision operator , the ` why ' remains obscure .",
    "classical lattice dynamics is conceived only as a @xmath124 limit of the quantum theory .",
    "the situation is more favorable in wave turbulence , where the starting point is a weakly nonlinear system of wave equations in hamiltonian form @xcite .",
    "statistical properties are accessible and the validity of gaussian statistics is an important issue @xcite .    at present , we are very far away from a complete mathematical proof of the existence of the limit in eq .",
    "( [ 2.22 ] ) together with the property that the limiting wigner function is the solution to ( [ 3.3 ] ) , ( [ 3.4 ] ) with initial conditions @xmath92 . apparently ,",
    "the only available technique is to expand with respect to @xmath34 into a time - dependent perturbation series .",
    "each term of the series can be represented symbolically as a feynman diagram , which represents an oscillatory integral . in the limit",
    "@xmath76 most diagrams vanish ( subleading diagrams ) and a few do not vanish ( leading diagrams ) .",
    "the sum over all leading diagrams yields the time - dependent perturbation series of the boltzmann equation , where the free flow is integrated and the collision term is regarded as perturbation .",
    "the conjectured division into leading and subleading diagrams is explained in @xcite .",
    "the program outlined has been carried out only fragmentarily .",
    "the first order , proportional to @xmath57 , vanishes .",
    "to second order one expects the limit @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "while such limit could be established at the level of generality discussed here , even this point has not be accomplished .",
    "closest to the goal comes the very careful analysis of ho and landau @xcite , who study the same problem for a weakly interacting fermi liquid on @xmath7 with nearest neighbor hopping and obtain the analogue of ( [ 3.5 ] ) .",
    "et al_. @xcite consider a weakly interacting quantum fluid in @xmath13 with the usual kinetic energy @xmath127 . in our context",
    "this would correspond to the nonlinear schrdinger equation , @xmath128 , @xmath129 with the effective potential @xmath130 @xmath131 smoothens the interaction on a microscopic scale .",
    "the role of the @xmath42-field is taken over by the fourier transform @xmath132 .",
    "the wigner function @xmath133 is precisely the standard wigner function for the schrdinger equation at time @xmath88 averaged over the initial gaussian distribution of the @xmath134-field .",
    "the boltzmann equation for the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ 3.6 ] ) has the same overall structure as ( [ 3.3 ] ) , ( [ 3.4 ] ) .",
    "more precisely , now @xmath135 and @xmath136 with the collision operator @xmath137    the feynman diagrams of the nonlinear schrdinger equation are a proper subset of those investigated in @xcite . using their result , one concludes that in the limit @xmath76 the second order expansion term is given by ( [ 3.5 ] ) with the appropriate adjustments for @xmath138 and @xmath117 .",
    "for dilute gases the @xmath46-function derived from the thermal equilibrium distribution of the @xmath139-particle system is a stationary solution of the kinetic equation .",
    "if one identifies the entropy with the logarithm of phase space volume associated to some given @xmath46-function on one - particle phase space , then the entropy functional turns out to be @xmath140 in units where boltzmann s constant @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath142 is increasing in time and constant if and only if @xmath46 is maxwellian ( at least in the spatially homogeneous case ) .",
    "thus the reader may wonder whether the phonon boltzmann equation has similar properties .    to determine the collision rule for phonons",
    ", one has to solve the conservation laws of energy and momentum , see eq ( [ 3.4 ] ) . for pair collisions ,",
    "i.e. @xmath143 , this amounts to @xmath144 and for three phonons mergers to @xmath145 where both equations implicitly define @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147 is obtained from momentum conservation as @xmath148 mod 1 , resp . @xmath149",
    "mostly one has to work with this implicit definition and only in very exceptional cases an explicit collision formula is available .",
    "an instructive example is the case one space dimension .",
    "mechanical particles would merely exchange labels and the boltzmann collision operator vanishes . on the other hand , for phonons in one dimension with an @xmath91 derived from nearest neighbor couplings , ( [ 4.1 ] )",
    "has a nondegenerate solution , thus providing real phonon collisions @xcite . in principle",
    ", it may happen that the energy - momentum conservation laws have no solution at all .",
    "then the collision term vanishes . in case of several solutions",
    "one has to sum over all of them .",
    "note that in ( [ 3.4 ] ) energy conservation can not be satisfied for the term with @xmath150 , @xmath122 .",
    "this term had been added only to have a more symmetric looking expression .",
    "a further instructive example are nearest neighbor couplings , for which the dispersion relation reads @xmath151 then ( [ 4.2 ] ) has no solution and collision processes where three phonons merge into one , and their time reversal , are forbidden . as for dilute gases , there are only number conserving pair collisions .",
    "such a property is stable under small perturbations of @xmath91 .",

    "the issue whether there are further stationary solutions will be discussed below .",
    "following boltzmann , to define the entropy one first has to identify a family of macroscopic observables .",
    "if for simplicity , and in fact for the remainder of this section , we restrict ourselves to the spatially homogeneous situation , then in spirit the macrovariables are the phonon numbers @xmath160 , @xmath12 .",
    "to be more precise one has to employ the limit procedure of boltzmann , the only difference being that here we have to take into account the harmonic couplings .",

    "we remark that a complete discussion would have to specify in which function space one searches for collisional invariants .",

    "then @xmath134 is necessarily of the form @xmath192 with some constants @xmath193 . by our previous discussion",
    "this implies that the kinetic equation has a two - parameter family of stationary solutions .",

    "to have thermal equilibrium as only stationary solutions , there must be 3-phonons mergers on a set of full dimension .",
    "a more physical mechanism would be to include a cubic on - site potential , which appears naturally in an expansion with respect to the anharmonicity , unless there are special symmetries which would make this order to vanish .",
    "for the cubic potential a collisional invariant must satisfy the 2-phonons merger condition , which is ( [ 4.11 ] ) upon dropping @xmath195 .",
    "again , if there is a set of full dimension of 2-phonons mergers , then the only stationary solutions are the ones corresponding to thermal equilibrium .",
    "our discussion has interesting implications on the very widely studied fermi - pasta - ulam problem @xcite , see the special issue @xcite at the occasion of its 50-th anniversary .",

    "one explanation comes from the kam theory which demonstrates that in part the invariant tori of the linear dynamics persist under small nonlinear perturbations .",
    "thus a lebesgue typical phase point may not explore the full energy shell .",
    "a second explanation relies on the fact that for a special choice of the nonlinearity the hamiltonian system remains integrable and admits propagating soliton solutions .",
    "also , for the fpu model there are special solutions , the breathers , which may impede the relaxation to thermal equilibrium .",
    "kinetic theory operates in a different part of phase space .",
