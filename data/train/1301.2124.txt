    "even though the atlas and cms announcements of the 125 gev boson discovery  @xcite have not settled the question about the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking yet they did provide major hints pointing to its solution . at the moment , it is clear that the observed properties of the discovered boson are compatible with the standard model higgs boson hypothesis  @xcite . at the same time they are compatible with many alternative extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . from a theoretical point of view , the extensions get some preference over the sm higgs due to the naturalness argument .",
    "they include supersymmetry theories as well as theories where electroweak symmetry is broken by new strong interactions , like in technicolor  @xcite .",
    "most studies aimed at the evaluation of the impact of the new discovery on the alternatives theories assume the boson has a spin zero  @xcite even though integer spins two and higher  @xcite are also admissible by the existing experimental evidence . of course ,",
    "this assumption disfavors strongly - interacting theories without light scalar fields and calls for theories with a light composite strongly - interacting higgs  @xcite of a proper mass .",
    "following theoretical arguments , as well as the example of qcd , it seems reasonable to expect that beside the composite scalar the new strong interactions would also produce bound states of higher spins .",
    "the vector @xmath2 triplet resonance is a natural candidate to look for . from other point of view , in strongly interacting theories new resonances are required to tame the unitarity . if , as expected , the composite higgs couplings differ from the sm ones the higgs alone will fail to unitarize the @xmath3 @xmath4 scattering amplitudes and other resonances are necessary to do the job .",
    "the new scalar can be accommodated by extra - dimensional theories  @xcite as well . there , additional new resonances , if observed at the lhc , could be the lowest kaluza - klein excitations .",
    "the attractiveness of this development is strengthened by the maldacena s conjecture  @xcite on the dual - description relation between the extra - dimensional weakly - interacting theories and the strongly - interacting models in four dimensions .",
    "the effective field theory can describe low - energy physics of fundamental theories beyond the sm . in the case of strongly - interacting theories where the standard tools of perturbative field theory have limited applicability the effective field theory is a viable tool for the phenomenology of bound states .",
    "in addition , it can provide a unifying description of the low - energy phenomenologies of various new physics candidates and a useful bridge between theory and experiment .",
    "the bess model  @xcite is an example of the effective lagrangian describing the higgsless esb sector with an extra @xmath1 vector triplet .",
    "recently , we introduced and studied a modification of the bess model , the top - bess model  @xcite . the global @xmath5 symmetry of both models is broken down to @xmath1 . in these models ,",
    "the vector resonance triplet is introduced as a gauge field via the hidden local symmetry approach  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the speculations about a special role of the top quark ( or the third quark generation ) in the mechanism of esb we modified the direct interactions of the vector triplet with fermions . while in the bess model there is a universal direct coupling of the triplet to all fermions of a given chirality , in our modification we admit direct couplings of the new triplet to top and bottom quarks only .    in the strong scenario ,",
    "the direct coupling between the sm fermions and the vector resonance can depend on the degree of compositeness of a given fermion as well as on symmetry group representations the fermions are organized into . in principle , the degree of compositeness of the sm fermions can vary for different flavors and chirality .",
    "in addition , in some models the masses of the sm fermions are related to the product of compositeness of the left and right chirality  @xcite .",
    "if so , the hierarchy of the sm fermion masses provides a reasonable motivation to assume the third quark generation exclusivity regarding the direct interaction with the vector resonance triplet . on the other hand , universal degree of compositeness for all quarks",
    "is also viable  @xcite .    in the top - bess model , we allow for the possible chirality dependence of the direct triplet - to - top / bottom coupling .",
    "in addition , we admit disentanglement of the triplet - to - top - quark right coupling from the triplet - to - bottom - quark right coupling .",
    "this breaks the @xmath6 symmetry which is broken by the sm interactions , anyway . for the sake of the top - bottom disentanglement",
    ", we have introduced a free parameter @xmath7 that can weaken , or even turn off , the strength of the triplet - to - b@xmath8 coupling by assuming its value between zero and one .",
    "however , the @xmath9 symmetry does not allow us to do the same splitting for the left quark doublet .",
    "originally , as the bess model , the top - bess model has been formulated without scalar resonances of any kind because the primary goal was the systematic effective description and study of a vector bound state physics .",
    "however , the discovery of the new boson motivates us to study the consequences of the inclusion of a 125-gev scalar resonance into the top - bess model .",
    "the inclusion of composite scalar resonance(s ) into strongly interacting models were already considered in many papers @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate how the inclusion of the 125-gev scalar resonance influences the best fits of the top - bess parameters to the existing low - energy data .",
    "this analysis have been performed as a multi - observable @xmath10-fit taking into account the correlations among the observables used .",
    "the list of fitted observables is comprised of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 when @xmath15 and @xmath16 otherwise , and br@xmath17 .",
    "the mass of the considered vector triplet assumes tev values .",
    "the top - bess predictions of the observables are derived up to a 1-loop level within some approximations and after integrating out the vector resonance triplet .",
    "the maximum number of fitting parameters is four : the vector resonance gauge coupling and three parameters , including @xmath7 , responsible for the direct couplings of the vector resonances to the top and bottom quarks .",
    "we also perform fits when some of the parameters assume fixed values .",
    "motivation for fixing the values can be theoretical .",
    "to simplify the analysis the free parameters of the scalar resonance are set to their sm values .    as a by - product , this paper contains an improved analysis of the low - energy limits of the top - bess model without any scalar resonances in its spectrum . in the original paper  @xcite",
    ", the analogical analysis was based on a single - observable fits only .",
    "besides , here we extend the epsilon analysis by adding the @xmath12 parameter not considered in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec : tbess ] is devoted to the formulation of the top - bess model . in subsection",
    "[ sec : tbessnoscalar ] we briefly recall its original formulation as it has been done in  @xcite . then , in subsection  [ sec : addingscalar ] the model is extended by adding a scalar field representing the 125-gev scalar resonance .",

    "[ sec : tbesspredictions ] we provide the low - energy top - bess expressions for the observables .",
    "the obtained best - fit values of the free parameters of the low - energy limit of the top - bess model and their data support along with the corresponding confidence intervals are shown and discussed in several parts of section  [ sec : results ] .",

    "the top - bess model was originally formulated without any new scalar fields  @xcite . in this section",

    "then , we will extend the model by adding a scalar resonance with an ambition to accommodate the discovery of the 125-gev boson .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly summarize the top - bess effective lagrangian as it was formulated in  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian possesses the @xmath18 global symmetry of which the @xmath19 subgroup is also a local symmetry .",

    "namely , the scalar triplet @xmath51 can be gauged away by the @xmath52 transformation @xmath53 , leaving us with the pseudo - scalar triplet @xmath54 .",
    "the gauge transformation turns the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagresb ] ) into the gauged non - linear sigma model on the @xmath55 coset space .",

    "the recent discovery of the 125  gev boson  @xcite motivates considerations about possible extensions of the top - bess model .",
    "the focus of the pre - discovery formulation of the top - bess model  @xcite lain in the study of the new physics vector resonance . to avoid unnecessary complications the model s lagrangian did not contain any other non - sm fields .",
    "now , however , the model has to face the facts about the new 125-gev boson .",
    "we have chosen to investigate the simplest possibility : the extension of the top - bess model by the neutral scalar isoscalar resonance field @xmath84 of the mass @xmath85  gev .",
    "since the transformation properties of such a field under the model s symmetry group are trivial it is not difficult to build additional lagrangian terms to the top - bess effective lagrangian ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    adding the scalar to the top - bess model can result in the following modifications of the original lagrangian  ( [ eq : tbesslag ] ) @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are free parameters .",

    "of course , the mass and kinetic terms for the scalar resonance are needed .",
    "the self - interactions of the scalar particle can be introduced as well .",
    "the part of the effective lagrangian relevant to lhc phenomenology includes linear couplings of the scalar to sm particles and to the vector resonance  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the top - bess model , we will assume the flavor universality , @xmath93 .",
    "then , in the unitary gauge , the top - bess lagrangian with the 125 gev scalar resonance reads @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the original top - bess lagrangian and @xmath96 stands for the fermion masses .",

    "to which the effective lagrangian is valid  @xcite , for the finite piece there is no completely satisfactory approach available  @xcite .    beside the deviations in the fermion couplings of the gauge bosons represented by the kappas",
    ", deviations from the sm in the higgs sector should contribute to the epsilons as well .",
    "the higgs sector of the scalar - less case is represented by the gauged non - linear sigma model that can be viewed as the @xmath188 limit of the sm higgs sector . in this case , we approximate @xmath189 by the sum of the sm weak loop corrections @xmath190 and the loop contributions @xmath191 due to the kappas in the anomalous fermion lagrangian  ( [ eq : anomfermlagr ] ) @xmath192 of course ,",
    "the sm(1 ) contributions depend on the mass of the non - existing sm higgs boson .",
    "thus , @xmath193 is just a free tuning parameter of the approximation .",
    "we set it to the value of the cut - off scale @xmath194 of the le - tbess lagrangian .",
    "the cut - off scale @xmath194 , in turn , can be identified with the mass of the integrated - out vector resonance .    in the 125-gev scalar case , the first term of the approximation  ( [ eq : epsilonloopapproxhiggsless ] )",
    "should be replaced by the loop contributions due to the anomalous couplings of the scalar resonance to the gauge bosons and to fermions . however , since we assume that the scalar has the higgs - like couplings we end up with @xmath195 again .",
    "this time though @xmath193 represents the mass of the scalar resonance and should be set to @xmath0 .    to cover both possibilities",
    " no scalar as well as the 125-gev scalar resonance  the 1-loop sm contributions have been evaluated for four different values of @xmath193 .",
    "the 125  gev value corresponds to the case when a new scalar resonance imitating the lhc discovery is added to the spectrum of the top - bess model ; 300  gev , 1  tev , and 2  tev values correspond to the top - bess model without a scalar resonance .",
    "the 1-loop sm contributions to the epsilon parameters are given by the following relations  @xcite @xmath196 the numerical values of @xmath195 for the quoted values of @xmath193 are shown in table  [ tab : epssmvalues ] .",
