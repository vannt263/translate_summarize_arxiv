    "we have presented a general theory framework for describing non - adiabatic dynamics of josephson junctions with low energy quasiparticle states .",
    "the theory applies to a wide class of josephson junctions including transparent mesoscopic contacts based on 2deg , nanowires , quantum dots , and also junctions of unconventional superconductors .",
    "it was shown that in the classical limit the equation of motion for the phase must be solved together with a liouville equation for density matrix of low energy fermionic states .",
    "furthermore , we illustrated how the dynamics of such systems can differ significantly from the adiabatic ( tunnel ) junctions , by investigating the resonant dynamics of the phase and low energy andreev bound states .",
    "it was shown that nonlinear , two - state dynamics of the andreev bound states , rather than an adiabatic josephson energy , defines the nonlinear macroscopic dynamics of the junction . + this work was supported by the swedish research council ( vr ) , and the european fp7-ict project midas ."
