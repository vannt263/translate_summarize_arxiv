    "these conditions seem mutually compatible , and satisfiable simply by increasing the radial trap frequency @xmath37 with other parameters held constant .",
    "however , condition ( 1 ) can only be satisfied if the maximum density remains low enough to avoid any deformation of the radial profile due to the collapse instability .",
    "increasing @xmath37 leads to exactly such deformation , and ultimately to collapse , as it has the secondary effect of strongly increasing the density .",
    "this strong increase in density with @xmath37 is particular to the case of attractive interactions .",
    "increasing @xmath37 in a repulsively - interacting bec likewise acts to increase the density , but this increase is counteracted by the interactions ; these act to reduce the density , and cause the bec to expand axially . in the attractively - interacting case",
    "the response of the interactions is the opposite : increasing @xmath37 leads to axial _",
    "contraction _ of the bec .",
    "consequently condition ( 1 ) is far harder to satisfy for an attractively - interacting bec than a repulsively - interacting one . responding to this problem simply by reducing the interaction strength ( either through @xmath132 or @xmath2 ) leads to violation of condition ( 2 ) .",
    "the nature of the problem is made particularly clear by considering the waveguide limit : here condition ( 2 ) is automatically satisfied ( @xmath163 ) .",

    "however , such a ground state is achieved by _ lowering _ the product @xmath164 , and thus by progressing towards the limit of extreme diluteness .",
    "this physical behavior of the system presents considerable challenges for experiments aiming to realize a highly soliton - like ground state .",
    "in essence , the most desirable configuration is to have extremely high anisotropies @xmath1 , while keeping @xmath37 as low as possible .",
    "realizing such a configuration through extremely low , or zero , axial trap frequencies @xmath7 is problematic : such frequencies are hard to set precisely experimentally as they require a very smooth potential to be generated , potentially over a considerable length . furthermore",
    ", in the case @xmath92 the mean - field approximation ceases to be valid for an attractively - interacting bec ; the true wavefunction should be translationally invariant in this case , but the mean - field solution breaks this symmetry @xcite .",
    "even for very low but non - zero @xmath7 the mean - field approximation can lose validity due to the extreme diluteness of the bec , and the energy gap from the ground state to states with excited axial modes can become low enough to cause significant population of the excited states at experimentally feasible temperatures .    it is informative to consider the parameters used in bright solitary wave experiments to date @xcite . none of these aimed to realize highly soliton - like ground states in the sense considered here",

    "we compared new , analytic variational solutions based on these ansatzes with highly accurate numerical solutions of the gpe over an extensive parameter space , and hence determined how soliton - like the ground state is . initially assuming the quasi-1d limit to be valid",
    ", we showed that the true solution to the gpe is ( not ) soliton like when interactions do ( not ) dominate over the trap strength . in 3d , this picture is complicated by the collapse instability ; in the regime where all trap strengths dominate over the interactions a gaussian variational ansatz gives an excellent approximation to the true , and non - soliton - like ground state .",
    "in contrast to the quasi-1d limit , however , we have shown that the regime in which the ground state is truly soliton - like ( well approximated by a soliton variational ansatz ) is either non - existent , or highly restricted , depending on the trap anisotropy .",
    "for low anisotropies , as one raises the strength of the interactions such that they approach and exceed the strength of the axial trap the true ground state ceases to be well - described by a gaussian variational ansatz , but does not become well - described by a soliton variational ansatz before the interaction strength also exceeds the radial trapping strength , leading to collapse . only by raising the anisotropy significantly",
    "can one open a parameter window in which the true ground - state becomes soliton - like before the interaction strength is sufficient to cause collapse .",
    "our results describe the nature of the ground state over a wide parameter regime , and offer a straightforward , accurate approximation to the full 3d gpe solution in many cases .",
    "our results are particularly relevant for experiments using attractively - interacting condensates as they identify the potentially challenging parameter regime required to observe a truly soliton - like ground state , which would be an advantageous regime for experiments seeking to explore and exploit beyond - mean field effects such as a macroscopic superposition of bright solitons . given that previous studies have shown that the dynamics and collisions of bright solitary waves can be soliton - like over a much wider parameter regime than our approach reveals the ground state to be , extending the variational approach used here to dynamical situations is an interesting direction for future work .",

    "<S> we consider the ground state of an attractively - interacting atomic bose - einstein condensate in a prolate , cylindrically symmetric harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> if a true quasi - one - dimensional limit is realized , then for sufficiently weak axial trapping this ground state takes the form of a bright soliton solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation . using analytic variational and highly accurate numerical solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation </S>",
    "<S> we systematically and quantitatively assess how soliton - like this ground state is , over a wide range of trap and interaction strengths . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals that the regime in which the ground state is highly soliton - like is significantly restricted , and occurs only for experimentally challenging trap anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> this result , and our broader identification of regimes in which the ground state is well - approximated by our simple analytic variational solution , are relevant to a range of potential experiments involving attractively - interacting bose - einstein condensates . </S>"
