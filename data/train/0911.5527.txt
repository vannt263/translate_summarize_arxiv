    "increasing demand for wireless applications on one hand , and the limited available resources on the other hand , provoke more efficient usage of such resources . due to its significance , many researchers have addressed the problem of resource allocation in wireless networks .",
    "one major challenge in wireless networks is the destructive effect of multi - user interference , which degrades the performance when multiple users share the spectrum . as such , an efficient and low complexity resource allocation scheme that maximizes the quality of service while mitigating the impact of the multi - user interference is desirable .",
    "the existing resource allocation schemes are either _ centralized _ , i.e. , a central controller manages the resources , or _ decentralized _ , where resource allocation is performed locally at each node . due to the complexity of adapting the centralized schemes to the network structure ( e.g. number of active users ) ,",
    "these schemes are usually designed for a fixed network structure .",
    "this makes inefficient usage of resources because , in most cases , the number of active users may be considerably less than the value assumed in the design process .",
    "on the other hand , most of the decentralized resource allocation schemes suffer from the complexity , either in the algorithm ( e.g. game - theoretic approaches involving iterative methods ) or in the hardware ( e.g. cognitive radio ) .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to devise an efficient and low - complexity decentralized resource allocation scheme , which is the main goal of this paper .        in recent years , many centralized power and spectrum allocation schemes have been studied in cellular and multihop wireless networks @xcite .",
    "clearly , centralized schemes perform better than the decentralized ( distributed ) approaches , while requiring extensive knowledge of the network configuration . in particular , when the number of nodes is large , deploying such centralized schemes may not be practically feasible .",
    "traditional wireless systems aimed to avoid the interference among users by using orthogonal transmission schemes .",
    "the most common example is the frequency division ( fd ) system , in which different users transmit over disjoint frequency sub - bands .",
    "the assignment of frequency sub - bands is usually performed by a central controller . despite its simplicity ,",
    "fd is shown to achieve the highest throughput in certain scenarios .",
    "in particular , @xcite proves that in a wireless network where interference is treated as noise ( no multi - user detection is performed ) , if the crossover gains are sufficiently larger than the forward gains , fd is pareto - rate - optimal . due to practical considerations",
    ", such fd systems usually rely on a fixed number of frequency sub - bands . hence",
    ", if the number of users changes , the system is not guaranteed to offer the best possible spectral efficiency because , most of the time , the majority of the potential users may be inactive .      in decentralized schemes , decisions concerning network resources",
    "are made by individual nodes based on their local information .",
    "most of decentralized schemes reported in the literature rely on either _ game - theoretic _ approaches or _ cognitive radios_. cognitive radios @xcite have the ability to sense the unoccupied portion of the available spectrum and use this information in resource allocation . fundamental limits of wireless networks with cognitive radios are studied in @xcite . although cognitive radios avoid the use of a central controller , they require sophisticated detection techniques for sensing the spectrum holes and dynamic frequency assignment , which add to the overall system complexity @xcite . noting the above points , it is desirable to have a decentralized frequency sharing strategy without the need for cognitive radios , which allows the users to coexist while utilizing the spectrum efficiently and fairly .    being a standard technique in spread spectrum communications and due to its interference avoidance nature , hopping is the simplest spectrum sharing method to use in decentralized networks .",
    "as different users typically have no prior information about the codebooks of the other users , the most efficient method is avoiding interference by choosing unused channels . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "searching the spectrum to find spectrum holes is not an easy task due to the dynamic spectrum usage . as such , frequency hopping ( fh )",
    "is a realization of a transmission scheme without sensing , while avoiding the collisions as much as possible .",
    "frequency hopping is one of the standard signaling schemes  @xcite adopted in ad - hoc networks . in short range scenarios , bluetooth systems @xcite are the most popular examples of a wireless personal area network ( wpan ) . using fh over the unlicensed ism band , a bluetooth system provides robust communication to unpredictable sources of interference .",
    "a modification of frequency hopping , called dynamic frequency hopping ( dfh ) , selects the hopping pattern based on interference measurements in order to avoid dominant interferers .",
    "the performance of a dfh scheme when applied to a cellular system is assessed in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider the problem of bandwidth partitioning in a decentralized wireless network where different transmitters are connected to different receivers through channels with similar path loss exponent .",
    "assuming the transmitters are scattered over the two dimensional plane according to a poisson point process , a fixed bandwidth is partitioned into a certain number of sub - bands such that the so - called transmission intensity in the network is maximized while the probability of outage per user is below a certain threshold .",
    "the transmission strategy is based on choosing one sub - band randomly per transmission , which is a special case of fh .",
    "frequency hopping is also proposed in @xcite in the context of cognitive radios , where each cognitive transmitter selects a frequency sub - band but quits transmitting if the sub - band is already occupied by a primary user .",
    "recently , orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has been considered as a promising technique in many wireless technologies .",
    "ofdm partitions a wide - band channel to a group of narrow - band orthogonal sub - channels .",
    "the popularity of ofdm motivates us to consider a frequency hopping scheme operating over @xmath0 narrow - band orthogonal frequency sub - bands .",
    "we note that the results of the paper are valid in a general setup where hopping is performed over an arbitrary orthogonal basis . to make the presentation as simple as possible , we take the orthogonal basis in frequency , which can be realized in practice using ofdm systems .      in this paper",
    ", we consider a decentralized wireless communication network with a fixed number @xmath0 of frequency sub - bands to be shared among @xmath1 transmitter - receiver pairs .",
    "it is assumed that the number of active users is a random variable with a given probability mass function .",
    "moreover , users are unaware of each other s codebooks , and hence , no multiuser detection is possible .",
    "we propose a randomized frequency hopping scheme in which the @xmath11 transmitter randomly hops over @xmath12 out of @xmath0 sub - bands from transmission to transmission .",
    "assuming i.i.d .",
    "gaussian signals are transmitted over the chosen sub - bands , the distribution of the noise plus interference becomes mixed gaussian , which makes the calculation of the achievable rate complicated .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are :    * we derive lower and upper bounds on the mutual information between the transmitted and received signals of each user and demonstrate that , for large snr values , the two bounds coincide .",
    "thereafter , we are able to show that the achievable rate of the @xmath11 user scales like @xmath13 .",
    "* we show that each transmitter only needs the knowledge of the number of active users in the network , the forward channel gain and the maximum interference at its desired receiver to regulate its transmission rate .",
    "knowing these quantities , we demonstrate how the @xmath11 user can achieve a multiplexing gain of @xmath14 . *",
    "we obtain the optimum design parameters @xmath15 in order to maximize various performance measures .",
    "* we compare the performance of the fh with that of the frequency division in terms of the following performance measures : average sum multiplexing gain @xmath2 , average minimum multiplexing gain per user @xmath3 , minimum nonzero multiplexing gain per user @xmath4 and service capability ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we show that ( depending on the probability mass function of the number of active users ) the fh system can offer a significant improvement in terms of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath5 ( implying a more efficient usage of the spectrum ) .",
    "it is also shown that @xmath8 , i.e. , the loss incurred in terms of @xmath9 is not more than @xmath10 .",
    "the paper outline is as follows .",
    "the system model is given in section ii .",
    "section iii offers an analysis of the achievable rates .",
    "upper bounds and lower bounds on the achievable rates of users are presented in this section . in section iv ,",
    "based on the results in section iii , we discuss how users in the fh system can fairly share the spectrum .",
    "comparison with the fd scheme in terms of different performance measures is discussed in section v. section vi offers a comparison between two versions of the proposed fh , i.e. , the robust frequency hopping and adaptive frequency hopping .",
    "finally , section vii states the concluding remarks .      throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the notation @xmath16 for the expectation operator .",
    "@xmath17 denotes the probability of an event @xmath18 , @xmath19 the indicator function of an event @xmath18 and @xmath20 the probability density function ( pdf ) of a random variable @xmath21 .",
    "also , @xmath22 denotes the mutual information between random variables @xmath21 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes the differential entropy of a continuous random variable @xmath21 . finally , the notation @xmath25 implies @xmath26 .",
    "we consider a wireless network with @xmath1 users operating over a spectrum consisting of @xmath0 orthogonal sub - bands . the number of active users is assumed to be a random variable with a given distribution , however , it is fixed during the whole transmission once it is set first .",
    "the transmission blocks of each user comprise of an arbitrarily large number of transmission slots .",
    "we remark that the results of this paper are valid regardless of having block synchronization among the users , however , we assume synchronization at the symbol level . it is assumed that the @xmath11 user exploits @xmath27 out of the @xmath0 sub - bands in each transmission slot and hops randomly to another set of @xmath12 frequency sub - bands in the next transmission slot .",
    "this user transmits independent real gaussian signals of variance @xmath28 over the chosen sub - bands , in which @xmath29 denotes the total average power for each transmitter .",
    "each receiver is assumed to know the hopping pattern of its affiliated transmitter .",
    "it is assumed that the users are not aware of each other s codebooks and hence , no multiuser detection or interference cancelation is possible at the receiver sides .",
    "the static and non - frequency selective channel gain of the link connecting the @xmath11 transmitter to the @xmath30 receiver is shown by @xmath31 . as it will be shown in ( [ hoolooo ] ) ,",
    "the only information each transmitter needs in order to regulate its transmission rate ( focusing on the achieved multiplexing gain ) is its forward channel gain , the maximum interference level at its associated receiver and the number of active users in the network .",
    "this information can be obtained at the receiver side by investigating the interference pdf and provided to the corresponding receiver via a feedback link .",
    "as all users hop over different portions of the spectrum from transmission slot to transmission slot , no user is assumed to be capable of tracking the instantaneous interference level .",
    "this assumption makes the interference plus noise pdf at the receiver side of each user be mixed gaussian .",
    "in fact , depending on different choices the other users make to select the frequency sub - bands and values of the crossover gains , the interference on each frequency sub - band at any given receiver can have up to @xmath32 power levels .",
    "the vector consisting of the received signals on the frequency sub - bands at the @xmath11 receiver in a typical transmission slot is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 transmitted vector and @xmath36 is the noise plus interference vector at the receiver side of the @xmath11 user . due to the fact that each transmitter hops randomly from slot to slot ,",

    "this is due to the fact that the crossover gains are not frequency selective and there is no particular interest to a specific frequency sub - band by any user .",

    "the ratio @xmath65 is taken as a measure of snr and is denoted by @xmath66 throughout the paper .",
    "let us denote the achievable rate of the @xmath11 user by @xmath67 .",
    "it can be observed that the communication channel of this user is a channel with state @xmath68 , the hopping pattern of the @xmath11 user , which is independently changing over different transmission slots , and is known to both the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "the achievable rate of such a channel is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mutual information between @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the specific sub - band selection corresponding to @xmath73 .",
