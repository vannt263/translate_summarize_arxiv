    "the current bloom in computational astrophysics has been fed not only by dramatic advances in computer hardware , but also by comparable developments in improved algorithms .",
    "nowhere has that been more important than in methods to solve the equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "that system is the most applicable to describe a vast array of central astrophysical problems .",
    "but , mhd has presented a special challenge , because of the complexity presented by three non - isotropically propagating wave families with wide ranging relative characteristic speeds , and the associated need to solve a reduced set of maxwell s equations along with the equations of compressible continuum fluid dynamics .",
    "the condition @xmath0 is a necessary initial constraint in multi - dimensional mhd flows and should be preserved during their evolution .",
    "while the differential magnetic induction equation formally assumes @xmath1 , non - zero @xmath2 can be induced over time in numerical simulations by numerical errors due to discretization and operator splitting .",
    "this is because , even though conventional numerical schemes may be exactly conservative of the advective fluxes in the induction equation , nothing maintains the magnetic fluxes in the sense of gauss s law .",
    "that is , nothing forces conservation of zero magnetic charge within a finite cell during a time step .",
    "numerical non - zero @xmath2 usually grows exponentially , causing an anomalous force parallel to the magnetic field and destroying the correct dynamics of flows , as pointed by brackbill & barnes ( 1980 ) .",
    "those authors , along with zachary ( 1994 ) show that the use of a modified , non - conservative form of the momentum equation can keep the non - zero @xmath2 small enough that no further correction is necessary for this purpose .",
    "however , the modified form is not suitable for some schemes , and more importantly may result in unphysical results due the non - conservation of momentum ( see , leveque 1997 ) .",
    "several methods have been suggested and used to maintain @xmath0 in mhd codes .",
    "we mention four here . in the first method ,",
    "vector potential is used instead of magnetic field in the induction equation ( see clarke 1986 ; lind 1989 ) .",
    "although @xmath0 is ensured through the combination of divergence and curl operations , the method results in the second - order derivatives of the vector potential in the lorentz force term of the momentum equation .",
    "so , in order to keep second - order accuracy , for instance , the use of a third - order scheme for spatial derivatives is required ( for detailed discussion , see evans & hawley 1988 and references therein ) . in the second method ,",
    "the mhd equations are modified by adding source terms and any non - zero @xmath2 is advected away from the dynamical region ( see powell 1994 for details ) .",
    "that method works well for some problems with open boundaries but not in others , including those with periodic boundaries . in the third method",
    ", an explicit divergence - cleaning scheme is added as a correction after the step to update fluid quantities ( see zachary 1994 ; ryu 1995a ; ryu 1995b ) .",
    "the method works well if boundary effects are negligible or the computational domain is periodic and if the grid used is more or less regular .",
    "otherwise , however , the scheme is not easily adaptable . in the fourth method ,",
    "the transport of magnetic field is constrained by the use of a staggered mesh : some quantities including magnetic field components are defined on grid interfaces while other quantities are defined at grid centers .",
    "the method has been successfully implemented in schemes based on an artificial viscosity ( see evans & hawley 1988 ; devore 1991 ; stone & norman 1992 ) . however , since it is `` unnatural '' to stagger fluid quantities in riemann - solver - based schemes , that approach has only recently been applied successfully in such schemes .",
    "conservative , riemann - solver - based schemes , which are inherently upwind , have proven to be very effective for solving mhd equations as well as hydrodynamic equations .",
    "these schemes conservatively update the zone - averaged or grid - centered fluid and magnetic field states based on estimated advective fluxes of mass , momentum , energy and magnetic field at grid interfaces using solutions to the riemann problem at each interface .",
    "mhd examples include brio & wu ( 1988 ) , zachary & colella ( 1992 ) , zachary , ( 1994 ) , dai & woodward ( 1994a,1994b ) , powell ( 1994 ) , ryu & jones ( 1995 ) , ryu , ( 1995a ) , powell ( 1995 ) , roe & balsara ( 1996 ) , balsara ( 1997 ) , and kim ( 1998 ) .",
    "brio & wu applied roe s approach to the mhd equations .",
    "zachary and collaborators used the bct scheme to estimate fluxes , while dai & woodward applied the ppm scheme to mhd .",
    "ryu and collaborators extended harten s tvd scheme to mhd .",
    "powell and collaborators developed a roe - type riemann solver with an eight - wave structure for mhd ( one more than the usual number of characteristic mhd waves ) , one of which is used to remove non - zero @xmath2 .",
    "balsara used also the tvd scheme to build an mhd code .",
    "the upwind schemes share an ability to sharply and cleanly define fluid discontinuities , especially shocks , and exhibit a robustness that makes them broadly applicable .",
    "but , due to the feature of the upwind schemes that zone - averaged or grid - centered quantities are used to estimate fluxes at grid interfaces , the staggered mesh technique has been slow to be incorporated for magnetic flux conservation .",
    "instead , the explicit divergence - cleaning scheme has been more commonly used . however , recently dai & woodward ( 1998 ) suggested an approach to incorporate the staggered mesh technique in the upwind schemes .",
    "it relies on the separation of the update of magnetic field from that of other quantities .",
    "quantities other than magnetic field are updated in the upwind step either by a split or an un - split method .",
    "then the magnetic field update is done through an un - split operation after the upwind dynamical step .",
    "magnetic field components are defined on grid interfaces , and their advective fluxes are calculated on grid edges using the time - averaged magnetic field components at grid interfaces and the other time - averaged quantities at grid centers through a simple spatial averaging . for the upwind dynamical step",
    ", the values of magnetic field at grid centers are interpolated from those on grid interfaces .    in this paper",
    ", we describe an implementation of the dai & woodward approach into a previously published upwind mhd code based on the harten s total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme ( harten 1983 ) which the present authors developed ( ryu & jones 1995 ; ryu , 1995a ; ryu , 1995b ; kim 1998 ) .",
    "the tvd scheme is a second - order - accurate extension of the roe - type upwind scheme .",
    "the previous code employed an explicit divergence - cleaning technique in multi - dimensional versions , and has been applied to a variety of astrophysical problems including the mhd kelvin - helmholtz instability ( frank 1996 ; jones 1997 ) , the propagation of supersonic clouds ( jones 1996 ) , and mhd jets ( frank 1998 ) .",
    "however , the range of application for the code has been limited due to the restrictions on boundary condition and grid structures , as pointed out above . in this paper",
    "we address those limitations by incorporating the staggered mesh algorithm to keep @xmath0 .",
    "_ however , instead of calculating the advective fluxes for the magnetic field update as dai & woodward ( 1998 ) , we calculate the fluxes at grid edges using the fluxes at grid interfaces from the upwind step . _",
    "the advantage of our implementation is that the calculated advective fluxes keep the upwindness in a more obvious way .",
    "we show that our new code performs at least as well as the previous version in direct comparisons , but also that it effectively handles problems that could not be addressed with the original code .",
    "we intend this paper to serve as a reference for works which use the code for astrophysical applications . in  2 , the numerical method is described , while several tests are presented in  3 .",
    "a brief discussion follows in  4 .",
    "we describe the magnetic field update step in two - dimensional plane - parallel geometry .",
    "extensions to three - dimension and other geometries are trivial .",
    "the induction equation in the limit of negligible electrical resistivity is written in conservative form as @xmath3 and @xmath4 the full mhd equations in conservative form can be found , for instance , in ryu ( 1995a ) . in typical upwind schemes , including the tvd scheme for mhd equations as well as hydrodynamic equations , fluid quantities are zone - averages or defined at grid centers .",
    "their advective fluxes are calculated on grid interfaces through approximate solutions to the riemann problem there , based on interpolated values .    here , we define the magnetic field components on _ grid interfaces _ ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 , while all the other fluid quantities are still defined at _ grid centers _",
    "( see fig . 1 for the notations used in this paper ) .",
    "for use in the step of calculating the advective fluxes by the tvd scheme , the magnetic field components at grid centers , which are intermediate variables , are interpolated as @xmath7 and @xmath8 since the mhd code based on the tvd scheme has second - order accuracy , the above second - order interpolation should be adequate .",
    "if non - uniform grids are used , an appropriate interpolation of second - order should be used . with the fluid quantities , including these magnetic field values , given at grid centers , the tvd advective fluxes are used to update the fluid quantities from the time step @xmath9 to @xmath10 @xmath11 as described in ryu & jones ( 1995 ) and ryu ( 1995a ) .",
    "strang - type operator splitting is used , so that the operation @xmath12 is applied from @xmath10 to @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 is the state vector of fluid variables .",
    "the advective fluxes used to update the magnetic field components at grid interfaces are calculated also during the tvd step from the mhd riemann solution with little additional cost . in the @xmath15-path the following flux",
    "is computed @xmath16 and in the @xmath17-path the following flux is computed @xmath18 here , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the quantities computed at grid interfaces . as described in ryu & jones ( 1995 )",
    ", @xmath19 used in the the @xmath15-path is calculated as follows : @xmath21 @xmath22 1 = 1 = 1 = @xmath23 @xmath24,\\ ] ] @xmath25 \\alpha_{k , i+\\frac{1}{2},j},\\ ] ] 1 = 1 = 1 = latexmath:[\\[q_k(\\chi ) = \\cases{{\\chi^2\\over4\\varepsilon_k}+\\varepsilon_k , & for $ |\\chi|<2\\varepsilon_k$\\cr    @xmath20 used in the @xmath17-path is calculated similarly .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the fifth components ( `` @xmath29 '' and `` @xmath30 '' , respectively for the two passes ) of the right eigenvectors and @xmath31 s are the left eigenvectors .",
    "they are computed on grid interfaces and given in ryu & jones ( 1995 ) .",
    "@xmath32 s are the speeds of seven characteristic waves which are also computed on grid interfaces . along the @xmath15-path , they are in non - increasing order @xmath33 @xmath32 s along the @xmath17-path is computed by replacing @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "here , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are local fast , alfvn , and slow speeds , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 s are the internal parameters to control dissipation in each characteristic wave and should be between 0 and 0.5 ( see the next section ) . the time step @xmath40",
    "is restricted by the usual courant condition for the stability .    using the above fluxes at grid interfaces , the advective fluxes , or the @xmath41-component of the electric field , on _ grid edges _ ( see fig . 1 for definition ) are calculated by a simple arithmetic average , which still keeps second - order accuracy : namely , @xmath42 then , the magnetic field components are updated as @xmath43 and @xmath44 note that the @xmath45 terms include information from seven characteristic waves .",
    "it is also clear that the net magnetic flux across grid interfaces is exactly kept to be zero at the step @xmath10 @xmath46 if it is zero at the step @xmath9 .",
    "the reason why we take the fluxes in ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) from the upwind fluxes for the transport of the magnetic field at grid centers is this . as can be seen in equation ( 2 ) along the @xmath15-path",
    ", it is @xmath47 that contains the advective term and requires modification of fluxes to avoid numerical problems . @xmath48",
    "causes no problems .",
    "the same argument is applied to @xmath49 along the @xmath17-path .",
    "we note that in the above scheme , the results of one - dimensional problems calculated with the two - dimensional code reduce to those calculated with the one - dimensional code , as it should be .",
    "for instance , in shock tube problems with structures propagating along a coordinate axis , the two - dimensional code produces exactly the same results as those given in ryu & jones ( 1995 ) .",
    "however , with dai & woodward s ( 1998 ) advective fluxes , that is not necessarily true .",
    "the code runs at @xmath50 mflops on a cray c90 , similar to the previous code ( ryu 1995a ) .",
    "it corresponds to an update rate of @xmath51 zones s@xmath52 for the two - dimensional version , about a 20% speed - up compared to the previous code , due to the absence of the explicit divergence - cleaning step .",
    "the numerical scheme described in the last section was tested with two - dimensional problems in plane - parallel and cylindrical geometries in order to demonstrate its correctness and accuracy as well as to show its robustness and flexibility . in all the tests shown",
    ", we used the adiabatic index @xmath53 and a courant constant @xmath54 . for the internal parameters , @xmath39 s , of the tvd scheme ( ryu & jones 1995 ;",
    "ryu 1995a ) , @xmath55 ( for fast mode ) , @xmath56 ( for slow mode ) , @xmath57 ( for alfvn mode ) , and @xmath58 ( for entropy mode ) were used",
    ". however , the test results are mostly not very sensitive to @xmath59 and @xmath39 values .",
    "we first tested the code with mhd shock tube problems placed diagonally on a two - dimensional plane - parallel grid .",
    "the correctness and accuracy are demonstrated through the comparison of the numerical solutions with the exact analytic solutions from the non - linear riemann solver described in ryu & jones ( 1995 ) .",
    "the calculations were done in a box of @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 $ ] , where structures propagate along the diagonal line joining @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "two examples are presented .",
    "the first , shown in fig .",
    "2a , includes only two ( @xmath15 and @xmath17 ) components of magnetic field and velocity , so that they are confined in the computational plane .",
    "the second , shown in fig .",
    "2b , includes all three vector field components .",
    "the numerical solutions are marked with dots , and the exact analytic solutions are drawn with lines .",
    "structures are measured along the diagonal line joining @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the plotted quantities are density , gas pressure , total energy , @xmath64 ( velocity parallel to the diagonal line ; i.e. , parallel to the wave normal ) , @xmath65 ( velocity perpendicular to the diagonal line but still in the computational plane ) , @xmath66 ( velocity in the direction out of plane ) , and the analogous magnetic field components , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .    in fig , 2a ,",
    "the initial left state is ( @xmath70 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath71 ) = ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath74 , @xmath76 ) and the initial right state is ( @xmath72 , @xmath77 , @xmath74 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath74 , @xmath72 ) , with @xmath78 .",
    "the calculation was done using @xmath79 cells , and plots correspond to time @xmath80 .",
    "the structures are bounded by a left and right facing fast shock pair .",
    "there are also a left facing slow rarefaction , a right facing slow shock and a contact discontinuity .",
    "all are correctly reproduced .",
    "the captured shocks and contact discontinuity here are very similar to those with the code using an explicit divergence - cleaning scheme , which was shown in fig . 1 of ryu ( 1995a ) .    in fig",
    "2b , the initial left state is ( @xmath70 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath71 ) = ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) and the initial right state is ( @xmath72 , @xmath74 , @xmath74 , @xmath74 , @xmath88 , @xmath86 , @xmath72 ) , with @xmath89 .",
    "again the calculation was done using @xmath79 cells , and plots correspond to time @xmath90 .",
    "fast shocks , rotational discontinuities , and slow shocks propagate from each side of the contact discontinuity , all of which are correctly reproduced .",
    "again , the structures are captured very similarly to what we found with the code using an explicit divergence - cleaning scheme shown in fig . 2 of ryu ( 1995a ) .",
    "as a second , and truly multi - dimensional test , we followed the formation of the compressible orszag - tang vortex .",
    "the problem was originally studied by orszag & tang ( 1979 ) in the context of incompressible mhd turbulence , and later used to test compressible mhd codes by zachary , ( 1994 ) , ryu ( 1995a ) , and dai & woodward ( 1998 ) .",
    "comparison of our new solution with previous ones demonstrates the correctness of the new code in this problem .",
    "the test was set up in a two - dimensional periodic box of @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 $ ] with @xmath79 cells .",
    "initially , velocity is given as @xmath91 $ ] and magnetic field as @xmath92 $ ] with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "uniform background density and pressure were assumed with values fixed by @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath53 .",
    "3 shows the gray scale images of gas pressure , magnetic pressure , compression , @xmath97 , and vorticity , @xmath98 at time @xmath99 , as well as the line cuts of gas pressure and magnetic pressure through @xmath100 .",
    "the structures , including fine details , match exactly with those in ryu ( 1995a ) , proving the correctness of our code .",
    "although only approximately the same initial conditions and epoch as those in zachary , malagoli , & colella ( 1994 ) and dai & woodward ( 1998 ) are used , the images show that the overall shape and dynamics match closely with those solutions , as well .      as an initial test for the robustness and flexibility of the code in a practical , astrophysical application , we simulated supersonic cloud propagation through a magnetized medium .",
    "we present three simulations differing in initial magnetic field orientation .",
    "the first two reproduce models a2 and t2 from jones ( 1996 ) , in order to compare with previous calculations .",
    "the third is a new simulation .",
    "all three were computed on a cartesian grid . in the first two cases the magnetic field is successively parallel to the cloud motion ( aligned case - a2 ) and perpendicular to it ( transverse case - t2 ) . in the third ,",
    "we present a new case with the magnetic field making an angle @xmath101 with the cloud velocity ( an oblique case ) .    for these calculations we used the same physical parameters as in jones ( 1996 ) .",
    "the cloud is initially in pressure equilibrium with the background medium and @xmath102 throughout .",
    "in addition , @xmath103 , and the cloud density @xmath104 . a thin boundary layer with hyperbolic tangent density profile and characteristic width of two zones separates the cloud from the background gas .",
    "the background sound speed is @xmath105 . at the outset of each simulation ,",
    "the ambient gas is set into motion around the cloud with a mach number @xmath106 .",
    "the magnetic field lies in the computational plane and is initially uniform throughout it .",
    "its strength corresponds to @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , it is @xmath108 for the aligned case , @xmath109 for the transverse case and @xmath110 for the oblique case . as in jones ( 1996 ) for the aligned and the transverse field cases the computational domain is @xmath111=[10,5]$ ] , whereas for the oblique field case it is @xmath111=[20,10]$ ] . the resolution is always 50 zones per initial cloud radius , @xmath112 .",
    "images of the aligned and transverse cases are presented in fig .",
    "left panels correspond to the transverse case , and show density images ( top two panels ) and magnetic field lines ( bottom panels ) for two evolutionary times , namely @xmath113 , @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the bullet crushing time ( see jones 1996 for detail ) .",
    "these are approximately the same times as those shown in figs . 1 and 2 in jones ( 1996 ) .",
    "figures representing the aligned field case are analogously illustrated in the right panels .",
    "as we can see there is a general agreement in both the density distribution and the magnetic field structure between the cases in fig . 4a and the corresponding cases ( t2 and a2 ) in jones ( 1996 ) .",
    "minor differences appear in the details of the cloud shape and the magnetic field adjacent to the cloud for the aligned field case at @xmath116 .",
    "as pointed out in jones ( 1996 ) , the nonlinear evolution of these clouds depends very sensitively on the exact initial perturbations and their growth . for both sets of simulations the perturbations develop out of geometrical mismatches between the cloud and the grid .",
    "we showed in that paper , for example , that consequently a simple shift of the initial cloud center by 0.5 zone on the @xmath15 axis caused differences much greater than those illustrated here . similarly , even minor changes in the field adjacent to the cloud near the start of the calculation or in the dissipation constants used can be expected to lead to observable changes in the detailed cloud features .",
    "thus , by considering different schemes to keep @xmath0 used as well as different values of @xmath59 and @xmath39 s used in the different sets of simulations , we judge the agreement between the two codes to be good .",
    "in addition , the new code seems better able to handle the extreme rarefaction that forms to the rear of the cloud immediately after it is set in motion .",
    "that is a severe test , since the plasma @xmath117 abruptly drops from values larger than unity to values smaller than @xmath118 .",
    "the simulation of a cloud interacting with an oblique magnetic field offers a good example of the increased flexibility of the new code .",
    "this situation is more realistic than the other two , but difficult to simulate with the old code because of its lack of a suitable periodic space for solving poisson s equation in the explicit divergence - cleaning step .",
    "since the aligned and transverse field cases differ considerably in their dynamics , it is astrophysically important to be able to investigate the general case of an oblique magnetic field . fig .",
    "4b illustrates the properties of one such simulation with the new code .",
    "further details are discussed in miniati ( 1998b ) .",
    "top and bottom panels correspond to density distribution and field line geometry respectively for two different evolutionary times ( again @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) .",
    "as we can see the evolution of the oblique case produces several features analogous to the previous transverse field case .",
    "in particular the magnetic field lines drape around the cloud nose and form an intense magnetic region there , due to field line stretching . in this fashion the field lines compress the already shock crushed cloud and prevent the rapid growth of the kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities ( jones 1996 ) .",
    "however , the broken symmetry across the motion axis also generates uneven magnetic field tension that causes some rotation and lateral motion of the cloud .",
    "in addition , it enhances turbulent motions in the wake and , therefore , the onset of the tearing mode instability and magnetic reconnection there .      as a final test to confirm the robustness of the new code and to demonstrate its application with a different grid geometry",
    ", we illustrate the simulation of a light cylindrical mhd jet with a top - hat velocity profile .",
    "the jet enters a cylindrical box of @xmath119 $ ] and @xmath120 $ ] at @xmath121 .",
    "the grid of the box is uniform with @xmath122 cells and the jet has a radius , @xmath123 , of @xmath124 cells .",
    "the ambient medium has sound speed @xmath125 and poloidal magnetic field ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) with magnetic pressure 1% of gas pressure ( plasma @xmath128 ) .",
    "the jet has mach number @xmath129 , gas density contrast @xmath130 , and gas pressure in equilibrium with that of the ambient medium .",
    "it carries a helical magnetic field with @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath127 .",
    "the jet is slightly over - pressured due to the additional @xmath133 component , but the additional pressure is too small to have any significant dynamical consequences .",
    "the simulation was stopped at @xmath134 when the bow shock reached the right boundary .",
    "it takes about about 20 cpu hours on a cray c90 processor or about 90 cpu hours on a sgi octane with a 195 mhz r10000 .",
    "5 shows the images of the log of the gas density and total magnetic field pressure ( fig .",
    "5a ) and the velocity vectors and the @xmath135 and @xmath41 magnetic field vector components ( fig .",
    "5b ) at five different epochs , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 @xmath139 , and @xmath140 .",
    "the length of velocity arrows is scaled as @xmath141 and that of magnetic field arrows as @xmath142 .",
    "the figures exhibit clearly the complexity and unsteadiness of the flows . by viewing an animation of the simulation , which is posted in the web site http://canopus.chungnam.ac.kr/ryu/testjet/testjet.html ,",
    "it becomes obvious that all of the structures are ephemeral and/or highly variable .",
    "the most noticeable structures are the bow shock of the ambient medium and the terminal shock of the jet material .",
    "in addition , the jet material expands and then refocuses alternately as it flows and creates several internal oblique shocks , as described in many previous works , for example , lind ( 1989 ) . the terminal and oblique shocks",
    "are neither steady nor stationary structures .",
    "the oblique shocks interact episodically with the terminal shock , resulting in disruption and reformation of the terminal shocks .",
    "the terminal shock includes a mach stem , so that the jet material near the outside of the jet exits through the oblique portion of the shock . that material carries vorticity and forms a cocoon around the jet .",
    "the vorticity is further developed into complicated turbulent flows in the jet boundary layer , which is subject to the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "there are distinct episodes of strong vortex shedding which coincide with disruption and reformation of the terminal shock .",
    "its remnants are visible as rolls in the figures .    although the total magnetic field in the back - flow region is strong compared to @xmath143 , as can be seen in the @xmath144 images , the components @xmath145 and @xmath69 are comparatively small , as can be seen in the vector plots .",
    "this is because reconnection induced by the complicated turbulent flow motion of the jet material has frequently annihilated @xmath145 and @xmath69 , at the same time that @xmath133 has been enhanced by stretching . in an axis - symmetric calculation ,",
    "the @xmath133 component can not be modified by reconnection , since it is decoupled from the other two magnetic field components .",
    "we emphasize that the details of the magnetic field configuration are sensitive to the assumed helical field within the incoming jet , so that our test results are representative only .    good agreement of this simulation with previous works such as lind ( 1989 ) provides another confirmation of validity and applicability of the new code . detailed discussion of comparable jet simulations carried out with this new code in the context of radio galaxies , including acceleration and transport of relativistic electrons , have been reported in jones ( 1998 ) .",
    "for ordinary gasdynamics development of conservative , high order , monotonicity - preserving , riemann - solution based algorithms , such as the tvd scheme employed here , provided a key step by enabling stable , accurate and sharp capture of strong discontinuities expected in compressible flows , while efficiently following smooth flows with a good economy of grid cells .",
    "the methods maintain exact mass , energy and momentum conservation and seem to do a good job of representing sub - grid - scale dissipation processes ( porter and woodward 1994 ) .",
    "recent extension of those methods to mhd have also shown great promise , since they offer the same principal advantages as in gasdynamics .",
    "the main disadvantage of the riemann methods in mhd were , until now , that they are basically finite volume schemes , so that they depend on knowing information averaged over a zone volume , or equivalently in second order schemes , at grid centers .",
    "the problem this presented came from the fact that the conservation of magnetic charge depends on a surface integral constraint , which is not guaranteed by the conservation of advective fluxes used in the remaining set of mhd relations .",
    "as discussed in the introduction this can lead to physically spurious results .",
    "consequently , it is a significant advance to develop accurate , efficient and robust schemes for maintaining zero magnetic charge that are adaptable to riemann - based methods .",
    "the method discussed in this paper seems to be an excellent choice . _",
    "since it exactly conserves the surface integral of magnetic flux over a cell and does it in an upwind fashion _ , it represents a class of techniques that have come to be called  method of characteristics , constrained transport \" or  mocct \" . in this paper",
    "we outline a specific implementation of this scheme inside a multi - dimensional mhd extension of harten s tvd scheme . with our prescription",
    "it should be straightforward for other workers to accomplish the same outcome . through a varied bank of test problems we have been able to demonstrate the accuracy and the flexibility of the methods we have employed .",
    "thus , we believe this code and others like it offer great potential for exploration of a wide variety of important astrophysical problems . already the code described in the paper has been used successfully in jones ( 1998 ) , miniati ( 1998a ) , and miniati ( 1998b ) to study propagation of cylindrical mhd jets including the acceleration and transport of relativistic electrons , and to study the propagation and collision between interstellar plasma clouds .",
