    "in the diffusion - collision model ( dcm ) of protein folding ( bashford et al 1988 , karplus and weaver , 1976 , 1979 , 1994 ) the protein is modeled using a collection of spheres connected by flexible strings .",
    "the spheres represent the secondary structural elements such as @xmath0-helices or @xmath1-sheets , called microdomains , that make up the protein .",
    "the folding process from a completely unfolded protein to the the final native state is accomplished via diffusion through the solvent , collision , and finally coalescence of the microdomains .",
    "the state of the protein is defined by the number of pairings ( hydrophobic interactions ) between the microdomains that are present at a given time @xmath2 .",
    "the rate equations for transitions between these states can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the vector of states and @xmath5 is a matrix containing the transition rates between the different states .",
    "as an example , consider a simple monomeric protein containing two @xmath0-helices a and b joined by a connecting string .",
    "this gives us a one - pair / two - state system .",
    "we will call state @xmath6 the state when the two microdomains are not in hydrophobic contact , and state @xmath7 when they are hydrophobically docked . in this case ( [ rateeqn ] ) can easily be written out explicitly    @xmath8    or in matrix form as    @xmath9 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } p_{1}(t)\\\\ p_{2}(t ) \\end{array}\\right ) .\\ ] ]    a more complicated protein having , say , @xmath10 microdomains would involve @xmath11 pairings , @xmath12 states @xmath13 and a @xmath14 rate matrix @xmath15 .",
    "in general the calculation of the elements of the rate matrix @xmath5 is somewhat involved .",
    "the forward rates are the rates of microdomain coalescence . in the diffusion - collision model",
    "the forward rates are calculated assuming the microdomains diffuse through a solvent environment , the space of which is limited by the length of the intervening strings and the van der waals radii of the microdomains .",
    "these microdomains are assumed to be nascently formed , and their degree of formation is given by a helix - coil transition theory ( zimm and bragg , 1959 , lifson and roig , 1961 ) as in agadir ( lacroix et al , 1998 , munoz and serrano , 1994 a , b , c , 1997 ) calculation in the case of @xmath0-helices , or via a combination of theory ( munoz et al , 1998 ) and experiment ( dinner et al , 1999 ) in the case of @xmath1-sheets .",
    "as the microdomains undergo diffusion , they occasionally collide .",
    "when this happens the microdomains coalesce with a probability @xmath16 , being held together by hydrophobic interactions in the case of @xmath0-helices , or a combination of hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions in the case of @xmath1-sheets .",
    "the coalescence probability @xmath16 is given by the likelihood that the microdomain is in @xmath0-helical or @xmath1-sheet form , the percentage of hydrophobic area , and the likelihood of proper geometrical orientation upon collision .",
    "the forward folding times in the mean first passage time approximation ( weiss , 1967 , weaver , 1979 , szabo et al 1980 ) are given by    @xmath17    where _",
    "@xmath18 _ is the diffusion volume available to the microdomain pair , _",
    "@xmath19 _ is the target area for collisions , _",
    "@xmath20 _ is the relative diffusion coefficient , @xmath16 is the probability of coalescence upon collision and _ @xmath21 _ and _ @xmath22 _ are geometrical parameters calculated for diffusion in a spherical space .",
    "the inverse of the first passage time - scales @xmath23 are the forward folding rates _ @xmath24 _ that are used in the rate matrix @xmath5__. _ _ in the example given by ( [ couplerate ] ) and ( [ couplerate2 ] ) , @xmath24 is @xmath25 .",
    "the microdomain pairings can also dissociate . to date , in typical diffusion - collision model calculations , the form of the backward folding , or unfolding times @xmath26 used for two microdomains a and b comes from from the vant hoff - arrhenius law ( vant hoff , 1884 , arrhenius , 1889 ) given by    @xmath27    where _",
    "@xmath28 _ is the free energy change per unit buried hydrophobic area in the pairing ( chothia , 1974 ) , _",
    "@xmath29 _ is the buried area ( lee and richards , 1971 ) , _",
    "@xmath30 _ is boltzmann s constant , _ @xmath31 _ is the temperature and @xmath32 is an attempt rate .    in diffusion collision model calculations to date",
    "the attempt rate is a parameter whose value must be set by hand , usually requiring some guess work or adjustment to obtain the desired result ( see for example burton et .",
    "al 1998 ) .",
    "the typical values used lie in the range @xmath33 , obtained from estimates of covalent bond oscillation frequencies ( fersht , 1999 ) .",
    "this procedure is not explicitly stated in most diffusion - collision model studies ; it is justified , however , when the equilibrium occupation probabilities of the states are known .",
    "in fact , the rate constants can be calculated from such probabilities ( chandler , 1987 ) . in cases where the final occupation probabilities are unknown , for instance in studies of protein mis - folding and non - native kinetic intermediates ( beck et al . , 2000 ) , such methods are clearly not possible .    in this work",
    "we show how the parameter @xmath32 , or more generally the unfolding rates , can be determined from thermal fluctuations providing a means of avoiding the guesswork .",
    "this makes the diffusion - collision model more predictive and enables it to be used in situations where the final occupation probabilities are unknown .",
    "in order to calculate the backward rate it is convenient to view the unfolding process as that of diffusion within , and escape from , an effective one - dimensional potential well .",
    "this is a good approximation if only motion perpendicular to the hydrophobic contact surface is important in microdomain pair dissociation .",
    "consider the pair of microdomains a and b connected by a string .",
    "microdomain coalescence and dissociation can be approximated by diffusion in a potential like the one depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the quantity that diffuses is the separation between the microdomains and we can think of    @xmath34    as the fraction of microdomains with a distance between them in the range @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in a potential @xmath37",
    "the probability density @xmath38 satisfies the one dimensional smoluchowski equation    @xmath39 .\\ ] ]    the outer boundary on the far right is given by an infinite potential , arising from the two microdomains coming to the end of their connecting string .",
    "the inner boundary is also infinite , stemming from the hard - core repulsion of the van der waals contact between the microdomains .",
    "the well depth @xmath40 is the free energy difference between paired and unpaired microdomains and the well width @xmath22 is set to the diameter of a water molecule .",
    "a separation larger than @xmath22 exposes the microdomain to the solvent , the free energy savings is lost , and the microdomains separate , resulting in an escape from the potential well .",
    "the forward folding rates can be satisfactorily found by the mean first passage time using the method outlined above ( [ mfpt ] ) . as a consequence of this",
    "we shall forego direct analysis of the entire diffusion process and concentrate on the escape of a bound microdomain out of the potential well in order to find the backward folding rate .",
    "if we concentrate on the part of the potential where @xmath41 in figure 1 , we can think of the potential as being perfectly reflecting on one side and partially permeable on the other .",
    "the permeability arises from the thermal fluctuations in the energy which allow the microdomains to escape the bounded region , provided they have sufficient energy , and it can be expressed using an appropriate choice of boundary conditions .",
    "we proceed as follows .    for the inner boundary , representing van der waals contact , we impose perfectly reflecting boundary conditions , meaning the flux through the boundary is zero    @xmath42    the flux at the permeable boundary at @xmath43 depends on the density of microdomains at that boundary and the probability that the microdomain energy is high enough to thermally tunnel through the boundary .",
    "the differential element of flux at the boundary @xmath22 of microdomains with relative velocity between _ @xmath44 _ and _ @xmath45 _ is given by    @xmath46    where    @xmath47    is the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , namely the fraction of microdomains with relative velocities between @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath48 is the reduced mass given by    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the masses of the two microdomains .",
    "the distribution is normalised so that the bounds of the integral go from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "it is clear that in order to find the total flux through the outer boundary at _",
    "@xmath22 _ we must integrate over all microdomain velocities larger than @xmath54 since the potential well height is @xmath55 , and only microdomains with velocity higher than that can escape and thus contribute to the flux leaving the well .",
    "this yields a flux out of state @xmath7    @xmath56    if we assume that the probability is uniformly distributed across the well , then @xmath57 everywhere within the well .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because the permeability of the well is so low .",
    "furthermore it can be shown that typically the damping time ( or velocity autocorrelation ) time is considerably smaller than the well crossing time and the mean first passage time .",
    "clearly then , diffusion in the interior of the well distributes the microdomain separations evenly among the available space and therefore @xmath58    the interesting result is that by using a stationary flux method ( kramers , 1940 ) , or equivalently setting @xmath59 the outward flux at the boundary in one dimension @xmath60 is the fraction of microdomain pairs crossing the boundary at @xmath22 per unit time and thus clearly identical to the unfolding rate @xmath61 for the @xmath62 microdomain pairing .",
    "below we explain this in more detail and show more generally how the rate equations of the diffusion - collision model ( [ rateeqn ] , [ couplerate ] ) can be derived from the diffusion equation .",
    "to understand this , we remember that the smoluchowski equation ( [ smoleqn ] ) is simply a detailed statement of the equation of continuity    @xmath63    the quantity in brackets in ( [ smoleqn ] ) is the flux @xmath64 , which includes the ordinary @xmath65 term , and the second term which takes into account external forces .",
    "integration of both sides of ( [ conteqn ] ) over the bound part of diffusion volume , using the divergence theorem on the r.h.s . and assuming isotropic flow into and out of the boundary of the diffusion volume yields    @xmath66    the lhs of this equation is the rate of change of probability in the bound region . on the rhs",
    "@xmath67 is a unit vector normal to the boundary , @xmath68 is the net flux which traverses the boundary surface and @xmath19 is the area of that boundary surface .",
    "we suggestively write the net flux @xmath68 in terms of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the probability fluxes in and out of the diffusion volume in question .",
    "we see from comparison to ( [ couplerate ] ) that ( [ intconseqn ] ) can be written out explicitly for our case    @xmath71    one can easily see that the positive terms on either side of ( [ indrateeqlsflux ] ) are equal to each other as are the negative terms . referring to ( [ totalj@l ] ) , this quantity is    @xmath72    making the rate    @xmath73    in this expression the one - dimensional `` area '' through which the probability is flowing is simply a point and therefore @xmath74 so identifying @xmath70 with ( [ totalj@l2 ] ) we can solve for the unfolding rates in @xmath5 , @xmath75 in ( [ couplerate ] ) and ( [ couplerate2 ] ) , by dividing ( [ totalj@l2 ] ) by @xmath76 , or setting @xmath77 in ( [ fluxovereprob ] ) according to the stationary flux method .",
    "we find the backward folding rate in the one - dimensional case to be    @xmath78    the terms preceding the exponential correspond to our prediction for the vant hoff - arrhenius attempt rate @xmath32 in ( [ brdcm ] ) . as an example , the attempt rate found for a coalesced pair of 16-residue regan - degrado ( regan and degrado 1988 ) helices with a combined hydrophobic area loss of @xmath79@xmath80 is @xmath81 .",
    "we believe that the most probable dissociation of a microdomain - microdomain pairing occurs via relative motion along a vector connecting the centers - of - mass of the two microdomains .",
    "this implies that typically the one dimensional case is the best way to view the dissociation event and therefore that one should use ( [ 1dbackrate ] ) to go about calculating the rate .",
    "the one dimensional case should also be sufficient if there is an `` unzipping '' of paired @xmath0-helices .",
    "it is possible , however , that dissociation may also include a relative rolling motion or other motion perpendicular to the axis connecting the microdomain pairs . in this case",
    "one needs to repeat the calculation above with a few minor differences : the relative velocity distribution of the microdomains is still the one dimensional maxwell - boltzmann distribution because the degrees of freedom parallel to the surface through which the probability is flowing do not contribute to escape from the well , the probability in the bound region is assumed to be evenly distributed in a two - dimensional `` volume '' , namely @xmath82 in the two - dimensional analogue of ( [ totalj@l ] ) , and the flux goes through a two - dimensional `` area '' @xmath83 in ( [ fluxovereprob ] ) .",
    "this calculation yields the result    @xmath84    due to the steric clashing of the side chains it seems rather unlikely that dissociation would include a relative sliding motion along the axes of the microdomains . for completeness",
    ", however , we include the three - dimensional result derivable from analogous considerations to the ones given above    @xmath85    although the three - dimensional result seems an unlikely candidate for protein unfolding it may be relevant in the context of molten globules .",
    "this approach succeeds in removing the free parameter @xmath32 from the model , and allows us to find the backward rates from a simple energetic model based on diffusion in a potential with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "moreover our results for the one , two and three - dimensional unfolding rates have a @xmath86 dependence that could be used to distinguish between this and other proposals for the mechanism of helix - helix dissociation .",
    "the removal of the parameter @xmath32 is important when considering folding processes which do not involve the native state . in previous applications of the diffusion - collision model ,",
    "the folding kinetics from a denatured or random coil state to the final native state were followed .",
    "in such a case , it is reasonable to set the parameter @xmath32 such that the native state achieves 90 or 95 percent of the probability , because we know that the final state is attained at the end of the folding process . in studying intermediate processes or more importantly , non - native intermediates ( beck et al , 2000 ) , where the occupation probability may be completely unknown , such reasonable estimates of @xmath32 are not available . in this case ,",
    "elimination of @xmath32 as a free parameter is crucial .",
    "we have presented a calculation for the helix - helix dissociation rate using a simplified potential surface , a square potential having a depth equal to the free energy savings of hydrophobic docking and width equal to the diameter of a water molecule .",
    "we have found the unfolding rates arising from thermal fluctuations out of this potential well to be in good agreement with currently accepted values of @xmath32 .",
    "the potential itself is due to hydrophobic forces , which to date are not well understood and for this reason the potential chosen was simple .    the initial motivation of this work was to eliminate the free parameter @xmath32 from the diffusion - collision model . in the context of this model",
    "our result should allow us to perform kinetics simulations than were not possible before , for instance time developments of non - native intermediates , in which the occupation probabilities are unknown , and reasonable estimates for @xmath32 are not possible .",
    "the results presented here also predict a @xmath87 dependence in all cases which can be distinguished experimentally from other proposals such as the covalent bond model where @xmath88 ( fersht , 1999 ) .",
    "another difference is the dependence of the unfolding rates on the states , not only through the hydrophobic area , but also through the reduced mass @xmath48 of the microdomains or groups of microdomains undergoing dissociation .",
    "this is markedly different from typical diffusion - collision model calculations where the attempt rate @xmath32 is assumed to be the same for all dissociation events within the protein .",
    "along the way we have re - examined the idea that couching the problem of association and dissociation of microdomain pairs via diffusion over a potential surface affords us a clear and simple picture of the protein folding process .",
    "indeed , the rate equations of the diffusion - collision model can be derived from such a picture .",
    "interestingly , the potential energy surface is an element of other models such as folding funnels ( for an overview see bryngelson et al 1995 ) .",
    "admittedly , our approximation is rather rough .",
    "the thrust of future work should therefore be in constructing more realistic potentials including activation energies of hydrophobic dockings .",
    "generalization to more complex proteins is straightforward because every interaction between helices or clusters of helices can be considered a two - state process similar to the one described above ; generally , the folding or unfolding of a given protein involves several such processes . in this case",
    "the diffusion space for each possible pairing could be constructed , and the forward and backward rates for each transition can be found , as outlined above , to construct the transition rate matrix @xmath5 in order to find the time evolution of the state vector @xmath4 . this is a much more tenable proposition than directly solving the smoluchowski equation ( [ smoleqn ] ) on such a complicated potential surface , although it could be done in principle .",
    "we would like to thank ken olum , david weaver , and larry ford for many useful discussions .",
    "we are further grateful to david weaver for pointing out a mistake in our calculations and ken olum for helping us fix it .",
