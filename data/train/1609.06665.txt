    "the quantum mechanical regime of gravitation continues to be opaque to our probing , both theoretically and experimentally , in the latter case due to the extreme weakness of the gravitational interaction .",
    "there are now many theoretical probes , including ( but not limited to ) string theory , loop quantum gravity , spin foams , causal sets , causal dynamical triangulations and asymptotic safety .",
    "however , none of these are yet complete or able to predict phenomena which can be seen experimentally . given the lack of experimental direction , we must rely heavily on philosophy and mathematics to justify any particular approach . these circumstances have motivated the careful study of mathematical toy models , often obtained by imposing symmetry and/or changing the number of dimensions of spacetime .",
    "such models , if exactly solvable , could help us to see around the obstacles occluding our view of the quantum regime of realistic theories of gravity .",
    "it is also possible that results obtained in the toy models might survive the transition to realistic models , and provide the basis for attempts to experimentally test quantum gravity",
    ".    gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric thin shell of dust in 3 + 1 dimensions presents a simple model of a matter  gravity interaction that has both classical and quantum solutions .",
    "classically , the theory is parametrized completely by a pair of phase space variables : the radius @xmath1 of the shell and its conjugate momentum @xmath2 .",
    "this is effectively a theory of particle mechanics , yet it is rich enough to describe dynamical black hole formation , including the evolution of apparent horizons and singularity formation . on the quantum side",
    ", this is a rare solvable model which describe a fully quantum interaction between gravity and matter . as such significant attention has been given to the quantum theory@xcite .",
    "perhaps the most influential work in this area is that of hjek , kay and kucha @xcite where a wheeler - dewitt quantization was successfully completed for shells with a rest mass @xmath3 ( in planck units ) . using a particular choice of time",
    "coordinate @xmath4 and a separation ansatz @xmath5 , the authors were able to solve for the complete spectrum of time - independent bound and scattering states .",
    "in the present paper , we study quantization of the thin shell model along the same line as hjek _",
    "et al_. the key difference is that we employ polymer quantization @xcite rather than standard techniques which assume that spacetime is a continuum .",
    "polymer quantization posits that space is fundamentally discrete near or below some microscopic scale @xmath6 , and that the continuum emerges only as a coarse - grained approximation .",
    "our results agree with hjek _",
    "et al _ in the @xmath7 limit , and we find interesting new results for the case of small but finite @xmath6 . in particular we are able to consistently quantize the theory for rest mass @xmath8 , and using numerical methods we are also able to solve the fully quantum equations of motion .",
    "in this section we establish the classical theory upon which the quantum theory is built .",
    "we begin by sketching a derivation of the classical equations of motion for a thin shell of dust collapsing under its own gravitation .",
    "details can be found , for example , in chapter three of eric poisson s text book @xcite .",
    "after these equations of motion are obtained we develop the canonical theory to set up quantization in the next section .    now consider the spacetime corresponding to a collapsing thin shell , which represents a codimension - one hypersurface of spacetime . outside of the shell",
    "the spacetime is described by the schwarzschild metric , while inside the shell spacetime is flat . the ` in ' , out and ` shell '",
    "line elements are : ds^2 _ & = & - dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d ^2 + ds^2 _ & = & - f(r ) dt^2 + f^-1(r ) dr^2 + r^2 d ^2 + ds_^2 & = & - d ^2 + r^2 d ^2 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the _ total _ gravitational energy of the shell .",
    "the next step is to impose the junction conditions at the shell in order to form a complete spacetime .",
    "these conditions require that the metric induced on the shell hypersurface @xmath11 from the ` out ' spacetime agrees with the metric induced at the shell from the ` in ' spacetime .",
    "furthermore , the junction conditions tell us that a non - trivial stress - energy is associated with the shell , given by [ s1 ] t_ab = ( [ k_ab]-[k]h_ab ) , where square brackets denote the difference between the outer and inner values of the extrinsic curvature @xmath12 and its trace @xmath13 .",
    "we take the stress energy of the shell to be that of a perfect fluid with 2d density @xmath14 travelling with the velocity @xmath15 of the shell [ s2 ] t_ab = u_a u_b . equating the stress energy given in ( [ s1 ] ) with that of ( [ s2 ] )",
    "is most easily done in terms of ` shell ' coordinates ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "doing so reveals that : 1 ) the rest mass @xmath17 of the shell is a constant of motion ; 2 ) the first integral of the radial equation of motion is e= m-=. [ eq : m1 ]    the velocity in the above equation is determined using the time coordinate @xmath18 of a co - moving observer on the shell .",
    "this implies a foliation of the spacetime into hypersurfaces labelled by constant values of @xmath18 .",
    "going to a canonical theory in terms of @xmath1 and its conjugate momentum @xmath2 , one finds that the hamiltonian is not easily represented as an operator in the quantum theory . following the steps outlined below ,",
    "one arrives at the following hamiltonian : h = m - . in the quantum theory ,",
    "the @xmath19 term must be treated as an infinite sum which is difficult to work with , although significant progress was made by hajicek@xcite .",
    "if we instead choose the inner flat space time coordinate @xmath4 , we obtain a hamiltonian that is more manageable .",
    "the relationship between the two time coordinates in question is @xmath20 , from which one can derive ( ) ^2 = .",
    "putting this into ( [ eq : m1 ] ) gives : [ basic ] e = - . where from now on a dot represents a derivative with respect to the inner time coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "this is the energy of a relativistic particle in a coloumb potential @xmath21 .    in order to arrive at the canonical theory , we take the total energy to be the hamiltonian , that is , @xmath22 , and find the momentum which is conjugate to @xmath1 for this hamiltonian : p = = . from this",
    "we obtain the following expression : [ htilde ] ( h + v)^2 = p^2+m^2 .    at this point",
    "we could take the phase space parametrized by @xmath23 , solve for the hamiltonian @xmath24 in terms of these variables and proceed with quantization .",
    "however , the resulting hamiltonian has a square root which is difficult to handle in the quantum theory . to avoid this problem",
    "we proceed by putting the hamiltonian into parametrized form , as in @xcite , by extending the phase space to include the time @xmath4 and its momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the equation ( [ htilde ] ) is treated as a constraint as described in the remainder of this section .",
    "the extended phase space has two canonical pairs @xmath23 and @xmath26 where the momentum conjugate to time is @xmath27 .",
    "the canonical action is i = p +",
    "p - h , where @xmath28 is the evolution parameter and @xmath29 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "the dynamics is generated by the hamiltonian constraint [ sh ] h:= -(p - v)^2+p^2+m^2 , which is quadratic in the momenta and does not have a square root .",
    "the equations of motion are : [ eom1 ] & = & -2(p - v ) ; + [ eom2 ] & = & 0 ; + [ eom3 ] & = & 2p ; + [ eom4 ] & = & .",
    "these expressions are equivalent to the dynamics described by ( [ basic ] ) , which can be seen as follows .",
    "the second equation tells us that @xmath30 is a constant of motion . using the first equation",
    ", we find from ( [ eom3 ] ) and ( [ eom4 ] ) respectively that [ eoma ] & = & = , + [ eomb ] & = & = - .",
    "taking the @xmath4-derivative of ( [ eoma ] ) and combining this with ( [ eomb ] ) , one obtains an expression which is equivalent to the @xmath4-derivative of ( [ basic ] ) .    this establishes the classical , canonical theory that we shall quantize in the next section",
    "in this section we establish a hilbert space of functions @xmath31 , and represent the phase space variables @xmath32 as operators on this space .",
    "we then write ( [ sh ] ) as a quantum constraint @xmath33 in terms of these operators and look for solutions .",
    "the polymer hilbert space is built upon the real line with discrete topology ( i.e. the bohr compactification of the real numbers @xmath34 ) @xcite .",
    "position eigenstates are defined as : _",
    "x(r ) = \\ {    ll 1 , & r = x + 0 , & r x    . .",
    "the basis is uncountable and therefore unseparable , but we will find that solutions to the constraint @xmath33 are defined on a superselection sector which has a countable basis and is separable .    the polymer inner product is : ( _ x , _",

    "using the inner product we find that the norm squared is : ( |(t , r ) , ( t , r ) ) = _ x |c_x(t ) c_x(t ) , which notably depends upon time .",
    "we choose the usual representation for the first pair of operators where @xmath38 acts by multiplication and @xmath39 acts as a partial derivative = t , = i _ x _ x _ x the second pair of operators requires more care .",
    "since we have position eigenstates , the action of the position operator is simply _",
    "x = x _ x. however , the usual definition of the momentum operator @xmath40 as a continuum partial derivative is not well defined because space is discrete . in order to construct a well defined @xmath40",

    ", @xmath6 is free to vary in both time and space .",
    "however in order to keep the equations manageable , we choose @xmath6 to be an arbitrary fixed constant .",
    "this amounts to partially choosing a lattice .",
    "since @xmath6 will enter the constraint equation only in the @xmath44 term , a choice of @xmath6 picks out the superselection sector ; only the coefficients @xmath45 and eigenstates @xmath46 which correspond to points @xmath47 on a regular @xmath6-spaced lattice will have an effect on each other .",
    "in general , a lattice is the following set of points l _ = \\ { x = + k  |  k } , + where the choice of @xmath48 picks the superselection sector . here",
    "we study the theory on two of these lattices corresponding to the choices @xmath49 ; one which contains the point @xmath50 and one which does not .",
    "notice that the lattices defined above do not have a bound on @xmath47 .",
    "this is necessary for the @xmath44 operator to be well - defined ( with the same definition ) on all position eigenstates . and alter the definition of @xmath44 at the first lattice point as done in @xcite ] this means that in principle , we are allowing for negative eigenvalues of the position operator , but since the @xmath51 operator comes from a positive semi - definite radial variable @xmath52 , we will study solutions with support on the @xmath53 lattice points only .",
    "there are conserved currents coming from the constraint equation , and we apply boundary conditions which conserve the corresponding charges on the @xmath53 portion of the lattice .    we now define the auxiliary hilbert space ( without boundary conditions ) : _ ^:= \\ { .",

    "this is a direct result of discretization : the continuum boundary condition defines the limiting form of the wavefunction at small @xmath1 , while the polymer boundary conditions involve the value of @xmath31 at one or two distinct points using ( [ c1 ] ) or ( [ c2 ] ) respectively .",

    "the energy density shows two peaks which bounce off the origin    while maintaining their shape .",
    "the kg density begins as a single pulse    which splits during the bounce leaving a completely negative region    which coincides with the outer energy peak . due to this negative    region",

    "@xmath144 : :    as the rest mass approaches the planck mass from below , we find we    find that the wavefunction continues to bounce off the origin , but now    exhibits self - interaction ( dispersion ) throughout the process",
    ". the    increasing spread of the densities implies the state is moving away    from semiclassicality and becoming more quantum as @xmath75    increases . as an example , we have generated animations of the kg and    energy densities for @xmath145 . here",
    "the total energy is    @xmath146 with deviations of less than @xmath147 ,    while @xmath59 remains normalized within    @xmath148 .",

    "given that this polymer theory is effectively a finite    difference approximation of the continuum , we expect the numerical    solution to follow the continuum behaviour more closely as    @xmath7 .",
    "since the continuum theory does not have    solutions for this range of @xmath75 , we expect the numerics to    fail for small @xmath6 .",
    "these numerical difficulties are    lessened for large values of @xmath6 which moves the first    lattice point further from the origin where the potential    diverges .    has a similar effect .",
    "] for example , with @xmath149 and    @xmath150 , the code becomes unstable when the pulse    reaches the origin , while it exhibits a bounce ( with some noise near    the origin ) when @xmath100 .",

    "the total energy is @xmath151    but undergoes a large deviation of @xmath152 during the    bounce , while the kg inner product remains conserved within    @xmath153 .    for all parameter ranges for which the code is stable",
    ", we find generically that the probability density becomes negative locally at some time during the evolution , and these negative portions do not go away as evolution continues .",
    "it is possible that such an effect could be due to numerical inaccuracy .",
    "however , negative kg density for ingoing gaussian initial data is seen even for very small values of @xmath75 where the numerics are optimal .",
    "the implication is that the dynamics we find numerically can not be described in terms of positive energy eigenstates , i.e. these states @xmath31 are not within the hilbert space discussed at the beginning of the section .",
    "whether negative eigenstates are a requisite component of any bouncing state is an open question .",
    "we studied the polymer quantum mechanics of a self - gravitating thin shell .",
    "the energy spectrum was found by solving for stationary eigenstates using the shooting method .",
    "when @xmath154 , the spectrum matches the continuum spectrum found in @xcite as the polymer scale @xmath7 .",
    "we find two independent choice of boundary conditions which conserve energy and the kg inner product , and in the limit @xmath7 these are both satisfied and are consistent with the ( @xmath3 ) continuum boundary condition . for finite values of @xmath6",
    "we find that there may be negative energies associated with bound states which is something not seen in the continuum theory . for @xmath131 where no continuum solutions exist , we find that the bound state spectrum does not converge to fixed values as @xmath7 , so that there is no contradiction .    in the classical theory ,",
    "all initial conditions lead to black hole formation .",
    "bound states are not present , so it is very interesting to find them in the quantum theory . replacing the classical particle ( shell ) by a quantum wavefunction has allowed for a superposition of ingoing and outgoing solutions with total energy @xmath155 which satisfy the boundary condition . for positive energies ,",
    "these states have positive definite kg density . if we interpret this as the probability density , these are highly quantum states with a large uncertainty in position .",
    "scattering states for @xmath156 are explicitly a combination of ingoing and outgoing states at large @xmath47 . since charges are conserved by these states , no energy is lost down a singularity at @xmath0 , indicating a unitary quantum evolution .",
    "a question this work brings to light is the meaning of states in quantum gravity .",
    "each state is a functions of both time and space , representing a superposition of shell spacetimes . in this formalism , how can we extract semiclassical information and recover a single notion of spacetime ?",
    "the physical observables seem limited to the total energy , which defines the location of a schwarzschild radius but does not indicate the shell location . if one wants to learn more about the spacetime , it seems something more is needed . to this end",
    "we considered the radial expectation value to represent the position of the shell .",
    "even classically , the value of the radius at a particular time is a slicing ( gauge ) dependent quantity . in quantum gravity",
    "we may need to be open to such gauge - dependent observables .",
    "we studied the dynamics of an ingoing gaussian probability density , taken to represent a semiclassical ingoing shell for small @xmath157 , and becoming increasingly quantum ( with a larger spread in probability density ) as @xmath75 approaches the planck mass from below .",
    "the probability density is positive semi - definite only for positive energy eigenstates .",
    "for all @xmath75 less than one planck mass , we find that the wavepacket bounces off the origin , but picks up regions of negative probability density .",
    "this implies that the bouncing states we find can not be represented as a sum over positive energy eigenstates .",
    "this suggests that negative energy eigenstates may play an important role in quantum singularity resolution .",
    "it is not clear whether or not the standard physical interpretation of these states as positive energy solutions moving background in time is relevant in the present context . in any case",
