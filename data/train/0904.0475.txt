    "gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions with negative cosmological constant is possibly the simplest realistic analogue of  general relativity . in spite of having no newtonian attraction",
    ", it gives rise to nontrivial black hole solutions that in many ways resemble astronomic black hole candidates observed at many galactic nuclei @xcite . for a comprehensive review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in an appropriate coordinate system , the metric@xmath5where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , describes a black hole with mass @xmath8 and angular momentum @xmath9 , provided @xmath10 . for @xmath0 ( and @xmath11 )",
    "the spacetime is globally ads and has no singularity . for the intermediate range @xmath12",
    ", there is no horizon surrounding the singularity at the origin and therefore these solutions are naked singularities ( * ns * ) .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to discuss the nature of the ns represented by the gap in the spectrum separating the real black holes ( @xmath1 ) from the anti - de sitter vacuum  ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "our observation is that these ns states are not completely unphysical , but correspond to topological defects produced by a @xmath3-brane at @xmath13 .",
    "black holes ( @xmath1 ) on the other hand , are not produced by matter sources coupled to gravity : there is nothing at @xmath13 .",
    "the black hole is a purely gravitational configuration without a matter source curving spacetime around it .",
    "the @xmath3-branes couple to gravity in a gauge - invariant way , a feature that might be instrumental in setting up a perturbative scheme for quantization and that can be generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "moreover , these ns can also have nonvanishing angular momentum and , in the extreme case @xmath14 , the geometry admits one globally defined killing spinor .",
    "these extremal @xmath3-branes behave as solitons that saturate the bogomolnyi bound bps states , and are therefore possible stable vacua for 2 + 1 supergravity .    according to our present understanding of gravity",
    ", singularities certainly form in gravitational collapse .",
    "what is not so certain is whether event horizons that protect outside observers from the singularity necessarily form as well .",
    "since ns can break predictability and raise a number of conceptual puzzles @xcite , it would be comforting if penrose s cosmic censorship hypothesis were a theorem in classical gr .",
    "numerical experiments , however , show that in a wide variety of collapse scenarios a horizon may not form at all , leaving a singularity exposed to  an outside observer numericalexp .",
    "the nature of these singularities and their potential as laboratories where quantum gravity effects could be studied , make them interesting objects of analysis .",
    "topological defects are examples of rather harmless ns produced by identification with a killing vector field that leaves fixed points in a manifold .",
    "the singularity is a submanifold that concentrates a deficit angle , like the apex of a cone in a two - dimensional euclidean plane with an angular identification @xcite .",
    "a cone can be described locally as a plane in coordinates @xmath15 , where the radial coordinate takes values @xmath16 , and the azimuthal angle @xmath17 has a deficit , @xmath18 .",
    "this topological defect is a naked singularity at the apex of a cone , @xmath13 , where the curvature is infinite , described by a @xmath19-function .    in these",
    "coordinates the metric has the standard flat form , @xmath20 , but the identification @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , produces the singularity at @xmath13 .",
    "a standard azimuthal angle @xmath23 of period @xmath24 can be introduced by rescaling @xmath25 , making manifest the topological defect through a factor multiplying the angular sector of the metric .",
    "the resulting riemann curvature two - form in two dimensions is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "then , as pointed out in jackiw90 , the identity @xmath28 is valid in the sense of stokes theorem upon integration , and a curvature singularity @xmath29is found at the origin , where @xmath30 is the dirac delta two - form with support at @xmath13 on the two - dimensional plane @xmath31(in polar coordinates )",
    ". it can also be checked that the torsion tensor vanishes , thanks to the property of the dirac distribution , @xmath32 .",
    "the result can be re - interpreted in terms of the identification by the killing vector for rotational symmetry around the origin in the 1 - 2 plane , @xmath33 .",
    "the angular defect results from the identification @xmath34,@xmath35produced by the killing vector field @xmath36 .",
    "note that the strength of the curvature singularity in the identified geometry equals the magnitude of the angular deficit , @xmath37 , times the two - form delta distribution , @xmath38 , which can be identified as the source of the conical singularity .",
    "this happens whenever a curvature singularity is the result of an identification by a spacelike killing vector that leaves fixed points @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant can be described by the cs lagrangian for the @xmath39 algebra , with connection @xmath40where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the generators of lorentz rotations and ads boosts .",
    "the corresponding ads curvature is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the riemann curvature and the torsion @xmath46-forms , respectively .",
    "a topological defect , analogous to the conical singularity described above , can also be produced in the global ads geometry , through an identification by the killing vector field @xmath47 , that leaves invariant the 1 - 2 plane of the three - dimensional ads spacetime .",
    "the fixed points of the killing field become the support of a source .",
    "the resulting geometry has an angular defect of magnitude @xmath37 and the metric reads @xcite@xmath48here @xmath49 is periodic ; for @xmath50 the conical singularity at @xmath13 disappears and the geometry becomes globally ads .",
    "direct computation confirms the curvature singularity at the origin of the @xmath51 plane , and the ads curvature is @xmath52[ab]}\\ , ,   \\label{ads - curvature}\\ ] ] where @xmath53[ab]}=\\eta ^{1a}\\eta",
    "^{2b}-\\eta ^{1b}\\eta ^{2a}$ ] , and the torsion vanishes . from the chern - simons field equations , @xmath54 , the @xmath55-brane source at the defect can be read from the right hand side of eq.([ads - curvature]),@xmath56    note that the norm of the killing vector @xmath57 is positive for @xmath58 .",
    "hence , the identification takes place in the euclidean ( @xmath59)-plane , and vanishes at the singularity .",
    "the time - like killing vector @xmath60 @xmath61 , that commutes with @xmath62 , is everywhere timelike , @xmath63 .",
    "this point source at rest at the origin of the spatial section looks suspiciously similar to a black hole : it is a localized , static , spherically symmetric , locally ads geometry . indeed , one can write the metric ( ads+point - source ) in schwartzschild - like coordinates by rescaling @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and @xmath66which looks like the black hole in @xmath67 dimensions @xcite . however , this is only an illusion because here the mass  is negative : @xmath68 , which shows that this solution is a naked singularity .",
    "this is correct , since branes are accessible ( naked ) singularities in spacetime and not protected by a horizon .",
    "in contrast with this @xmath3-brane , the black hole ( @xmath69 ) results from an identification with a killing vector , that does not have fixed points in the embedding space , @xmath70 @xcite . the btz manifold is topologically a cylinder and has no conical singularities , while the spacetime ( [ ads+point - source ] ) is an orbifold .",
    "the geometry described above is static , but a spinning @xmath3-brane can also be obtained by identification with an appropriate killing vector .",
    "the resulting stationary , axisymmetric spacetime is also described by ( [ btz metric ] ) where * *  * * @xmath71 and @xmath72 have the same form as for the black hole but with @xmath73 , and is again a naked singularity .",
    "this geometry can be seen as the result of an identification generated by two globally defined , independent euclidean rotations in the embedding space .",
    "consider the following parametrization of a pseudosphere in @xmath70,@xmath74where @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 chosen as @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "if the angles in the 0 - 3 and 1 - 2 planes have the form @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the ( real ) parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be related to the mass ( @xmath84 ) and angular momentum through @xmath85 thus , @xmath86 provided @xmath87 , and the static @xmath3-brane is recovered for @xmath88 .    the spinning @xmath3-brane results from a single identification in ads space , @xmath89 ,",
    "but it can also be seen as produced by two independent identifications ( in different planes ) in @xmath70 , @xmath90and @xmath91 , so that the corresponding angular deficits are @xmath92 and @xmath83 freedom .",
    "the killing vector @xmath62 that produces the identification @xmath93 , turns out to be a linear combination of two independent isometries , @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) . in @xmath70 ,",
    "the identifications along @xmath96 and @xmath97 lead to two conical singularities in the corresponding planes , @xmath98 in the covering ads space , defined by the pseudosphere @xmath99 , these identifications correspond to the single identification @xmath100 which , in turn , implies  @xmath101 .",
    "the ads curvature can be calculated working directly with the metric@xmath102the result is that the curvature has the form of the field equations @xmath54 , where using the topological identities ( [ dd ] ) , one can read the source of this spinning @xmath3-brane as @xmath103with the two commuting generators @xmath104note that this form of the current corresponds to two mutually commuting independent @xmath105 sources , corresponding to the cartan subalgebra of the rank 2 ads group @xmath106 . in the limit @xmath11 ( or @xmath88 )",
    ", the above expression reduces to the previous result , @xmath107 .",
    "the extremal spinning @xmath3-brane has to be addressed separately because the transformation ( [ spinning ] ) is not defined when @xmath108 ( that is , for @xmath109 ) .",
    "however , the killing vector @xmath62 has a well - defined extremal limit given by @xmath110where the last term represents a rotation by @xmath111 and can be omitted.(see @xcite )    from the point of view of the embedding flat space , two independent rotations in euclidean planes given by two independent generators @xmath97 and @xmath96 combine into only one generator , @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the killng vector changes its character , which can be seen from the corresponding casimir invariants @xmath113 and @xmath114 , that are also continuous in this limit , but correspond to a different type in the classification given in ref . @xcite . from the continuity of the invariants",
    ", one can expect that there exists a killing vector whose identification introduces a topological defect in the flat space that produces an extremal @xmath3-brane .",
    "the explicit form of this killing vector can also be found from the identification needed to turn the pseudosphere @xmath115 into the extreme black hole metric ( [ btz metric ] ) with @xmath116 , where @xmath117 , so that the lapse and shift functions in the metric take the form @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively . in the light - cone  coordinates @xmath120 , @xmath121 , the pseudosphere is locally parameterized as @xcite , @xmath122with @xmath123 similarly obtained as the rotation by @xmath124 of @xmath125 , for any @xmath77 .",
    "note that the transformation now depends on the noncompact coordinate @xmath126 , and@xmath127since the metric does not depend on @xmath128 , this coordinate can be compactified and the product @xmath124  now plays the role of a conical angle @xmath129 .",
    "the metric ( [ uv metric ] ) is equivalent to the one of the extremal @xmath3-brane for the particular choice @xmath130and relating the defect to the negative mass , @xmath131(@xmath73 ) . here",
    "@xmath128  is the only light - cone coordinate that is made periodic upon identification @xmath132 , whereas @xmath126  is not identified and remains noncompact . applying this identification to ( [ x extreme ] )",
    ", we find the killing vector that produces it , @xmath133where we used that @xmath134 .",
    "the source is therefore given by @xmath135 , as expected from the extremal limit .",
    "the extremal @xmath3-branes coupled to the @xmath67 ads supergravity admit globally defined killing spinors , defined by the condition @xmath136 . as shown in appendix [ bps ] , the spinning @xmath3-branes ( @xmath73 ) are bps states for the extreme case only , @xmath137 : for each sign of the spin ( @xmath138 ) , there is one globally defined killing spinor given by @xmath139which is defined for @xmath140 .",
    "thus , apart from the well - known bps states provided by the ads vacuum ( @xmath0 ) , the extremal ( @xmath141 ) , and the massless 2 + 1 black holes @xcite , also the extremal @xmath3-branes are bps states , which , like their positive mass counterparts , admit one killing spinor , that is , 1/4 of the supersymmetries admitted by the ads vacuum .",

    "* 1 . * generically , cs theories describe the dynamics of a ( nonabelian ) connection in an odd - dimensional space , which can be viewed as the worldvolume of a @xmath148-brane . in fact , cs actions as well as their interactions with external sources are structures of a similar nature z , ez . the particular example of @xmath3-branes discussed here are topological defects produced by an identification whichturn the 2 + 1 ads manifold into an orbifold with a naked singularity .",
    "it is shown that the resulting geometry is a state in the negative part of the black hole s mass spectrum .",
    "the lagrangian action for three - dimensional gravity with @xmath149 in the chern - simons representation is a metric - free , gauge invariant and generally covariant object .",
    "the coupling between gravity and an external source can be introduced through a minimal coupling of the form @xmath150 , generalizing the one in electrodynamics , where the 2-form @xmath151 takes values in the gauge algebra .",
    "the resulting field equations are @xmath54 , where the current has the form @xmath152 , is exactly what is found for the static and spinning @xmath3-branes , produced by angular defect , a  naked singularity with negative mass . in the black hole case ( @xmath69 )",
    ", there is no source in the rhs of the field equations . in other words ,",
    "black holes are not the result of coupling gravity to a material source sitting somewhere in spacetime ; black holes are just exact solutions of the homogeneous ads - einstein equations .",
    "* 3 . * these ns define mathematically consistent couplings between @xmath67 gravity and external currents produced by point sources .",
    "gauge invariance is partially broken by the presence of a source like ( [ spinning j ] ) , sitting at a fixed point in spacetime and pointing in a certain direction , explicitly breaking ads symmetry .",
    "moreover , the current involves some generators of the ads group and therefore it is not invariant under the action of the whole ads gauge group , but only under a subgroup of it .",
    "full gauge invariance of the theory would be restored if the current @xmath151 becomes dynamical , that is , if the current was produced by a dynamical field which is also varied in the action , on the same footing as @xmath76 .",
    "* the fact that these @xmath3-branes are nss is not necessarily inconsistent .",
    "moreover , it was shown that , if endowed with the right amount of angular momentum , they can be stable soliton - like objects that saturate the bogomolnyi bound .",
    "the fact that these supersymmetric states have negative mass seems to contradict the common wisdom that supersymmetry implies positivity of the energy spectrum .",
    "the point is that these are supersymmetric extensions of the ads and not of the poincar group .",
    "indeed , the ads vacuum has negative energy ( @xmath0 ) and it is perfectly supersymmetric .",
    "the presence of @xmath19-like distributions in the spacetime manifold could be troublesome in general relativity , especially if they appear in the metric . in general , this is a problem because einstein s equations involve products and inverses of metric components , and such operations are generically ill - defined in distribution theory . however , writing ( @xmath67)-dimensional gravity as a chern - simons theory circumvents this problem because all field equations only involve exterior products of forms ( and no hodge @xmath153-duals ) , which always give rise to sensible distributional products .",
    "a generalization to higher dimensions can proceed in two different directions .",
    "one is to introduce a spherically symmetric topological defect in a @xmath154 , that is _ not _ obtained by identification with a killing vector ( except for @xmath155 ) . in this way",
    ", @xmath3-branes in higher dimensional spaces are produced .",
    "alternatively , if a killing vector is used to produce identifications in a two - dimensional euclidean plane in @xmath156 , introducing an angular deficit in @xmath157 only , ( spinning ) codimension 2 branes are obtained .",
    "these directions are discussed in the extended paper @xcite .",
    "the topological defects discussed here could be the result of an inhomogeneous collapse , as seen in @xmath158  dimensions @xcite . since non - extremal defects are non - bps , they are probably unstable .",
    "non - extremal black holes can decay through hawking radiation , but no continuous decay mechanism is readily available for the topological defects and they may disappear through a violent explosion .",
    "it could also be the case that the states in the regions @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 , are forbidden by some general principle , and they might not form at all .",
    "the authors are grateful to c. bunster , j. edelstein , p. mora , r. olea and s. willison for enlightening conversations and suggestions , and to c. martnez for several useful comments and important discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by fondecyt grants 11070146 , 1061291 , 7070117 and 7080201 .",
    "the centro de estudios cientficos ( cecs ) is funded by the chilean government through the millennium science initiative and the centers of excellence base financing program of conicyt .",
    "cecs is also supported by a group of private companies which at present includes antofagasta minerals , arauco , empresas cmpc , indura , naviera ultrags and telefnica del sur .",
    "bps states are bosonic solutions of the field equations that are invariant under globally defined supersymmetry transformations . here",
    "we show that the extremal @xmath3-brane is a bps state .",
    "the analysis carries over to other examples in higher dimensions , with the appropriate supergoup in each case , but the arguments are essentially the same .",
    "the reason for this is that all cs supergravities @xcite are gauge theories for an essentially unique superalgebra that extends the ads algebra in every dimension .",
    "thus , in all cases , the supersymmetry transformation of the fermion ( gravitini ) takes the form @xmath162where @xmath163 is the covariant exterior derivative for the connection corresponding the the dimension in each case .    for @xmath164-dimensional chern - simons gravity ,",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the ads group is @xmath165 , and the connection ( gauge field ) is @xmath166where @xmath167 are the ads generators satisfying @xmath168 = \\eta _ { ad}\\,j_{bc}-\\eta _ { bd}\\,j_{ac}-\\eta _ { ac}\\,j_{bd}+\\eta _ { bc}\\,j_{ad}$ ] with @xmath169 , and @xmath170 are the susy generators .",
    "the susy transformation of the gravitino then takes the form@xmath171the spinorial representation of the ads generators in terms of @xmath172-matrices that satisfy the clifford algebra @xmath173 , is@xmath174 = \\frac{1}{2}% \\,\\varepsilon _ { abc}\\,\\gamma ^{c}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\]]where the constant @xmath175 corresponds to two inequivalent irreducible representation of @xmath172-matrices .",

    "moreover , the spinor @xmath200 must be a null eigenvector of @xmath198 , otherwise the solution of ( [ spinor null directions ] ) could not be single - valued : a nonzero eigenvalue would not be periodic in the angle @xmath23 .",
    "the representation of @xmath172-matrices is @xmath201 @xmath202and @xmath203 and , therefore , the condition for the existence of a null eigenvector is @xmath204thus , we conclude that there is a non - trivial killing spinor only if @xmath205that is , the solution is extremal , and in that case @xmath200 is a constant spinor .",
