    "gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies is recognized as a powerful cosmological tool . by measuring the various properties of the gravitationally magnified and distorted mirages of background galaxies ( the so - called arcs and arclets )",
    ", we can learn important information about both the lensing cluster and the faint , distant , lensed background galaxies . in principle",
    ", cluster lenses may provide a means to study normal galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath16 ) ; galaxies that would be out of reach of even our largest telescopes if not for the magnification of the lensing clusters .",
    "these galaxies are likely to be free from selection effects since they lie serendipitously behind the foreground clusters and are not selected because they are intrinsically bright , or are luminous radio or x - ray emitters .",
    "the majority of the arcs and arclets discovered so far are very blue , and are believed to come from the ubiquitous background population of faint blue galaxies ( fbgs ) seen in deep field galaxy surveys ( tyson 1988 ; colless 1990 and 1993 ; lilly , cowie & gardner 1991 ; koo and kron 1992 ; lilly 1995 among others ) .",
    "it may be possible to use gravitational lensing to constrain the redshift range of the fbgs by examining the frequency of lensing as a function of cluster redshift ( i.e. : tyson , valdes & wenk , 1990 ; 1993b ; smail , ellis and fitchett , 1994 ) .",
    "but for all its potential as a probe of distant galaxies , cluster gravitational lensing is presently finding its most useful application as a tool for studying the clusters themselves .",
    "cluster lens systems are relatively common compared to lensed qsos because the high space density of the faint blue galaxies provides a convenient background grid whose distortion we can observe around any sufficiently massive and concentrated foreground cluster .",
    "lensing can be used to measure the cluster mass , independent of assumptions about virialization of the galaxies or hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot x - ray - emitting intracluster gas . moreover",
    ", gravitational lensing provides a means to explore the actual shape of a cluster s total mass distribution , both visible and dark matter , at small radii ( @xmath17kpc ) using strong gravitational lensing ( giant arcs ) , and at large radii using weak gravitational lensing ( 1991 & 1992 ; kaiser , 1992 ; kaiser & squires 1993 ; mellier 1994 ; broadhurst , taylor & peacock 1994 ; smail , ellis , & fitchett , 1994 ; kaiser , squires & broadhurst 1996 ; schneider , 1996 ; squires 1996a and 1996b , squires 1997 ; geiger & schneider , 1998 ; clowe 1998 ) .",
    "clearly , a large , homogeneous sample of clusters of galaxies spanning a broad range of redshift would be extremely valuable .",
    "previous attempts to investigate the statistics or frequency of lensing have relied on optically - selected clusters with all of the problems inherent to the optical selection ( see lynds & petrosian 1989 ; smail 1991 ) .",
    "it is well known that projection and contamination problems can be avoided if clusters are selected based on their primary baryonic constituent  the hot , intracluster gas that is a copius emitter of x - rays  rather than on the optical galaxies which are merely trace components .",
    "we entered this investigation with two primary goals : first , to discover new cluster lens systems , and second , to systematically study a complete sample of distant clusters whose selection criteria were well defined and designed to avoid the contamination and superposition problems .",
    "the sample was selected from the _ einstein observatory _ extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) list of clusters given by gioia ( 1990a ) .",
    "\\(1994 ) presented preliminary results from an analysis of lensing in a subsample of the 16 most x - ray luminous and distant emss clusters ( @xmath180.2 and @xmath0@xmath19 ergs@xmath4 ) .",
    "note , however , that this subsample was extracted from the list of henry ( 1992 ) and _ did not _ include the 3 added clusters with @xmath180.5 ( ms1137 + 66 , ms0451@xmath603 , ms1054@xmath603 ; gioia & luppino 1994 ) since their redshifts were not known at the time . for the most part ,",
    "the data consisted of @xmath20 and @xmath21 `` snapshots '' taken with the cfht that allowed identification of the brightest arcs that might be present in these clusters . from this preliminary subsample , they concluded that bright arcs with large axis ratios ( @xmath22 ) were fairly common in x - ray selected clusters , and that this high frequency of lensing implied that the mass density profiles of the lensing clusters must be compact ( @xmath23 kpc ; see also hammer 1993 ; wu & hammer 1993 ; hammer 1997 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results from the 38-cluster sample . in  2 , we discuss the properties of the emss galaxy cluster sample and our selection criteria for this survey .",
    "we describe the optical observations and data reduction and calibration in  3 . in  4 ,",
    " 5 and  6 we present our data and describe in detail those clusters that contain giant arcs .",
    "in addition to the obvious lensing cases , we also describe those systems with candidate arcs whose lensing origin needs follow - up confirmation , either with deeper imaging or spectroscopy . in  7",
    ", we investigate the lensing fraction as a function of both redshift and x - ray luminosity .",
    "we also discuss the constraints the emss cluster lenses place on the cluster mass density profiles .",
    "finally , in  8 , we summarize our results and discuss the prospects for future work .    throughout this paper , we assume a cosmology where @xmath24=50 km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath25=@xmath26 , but we occasionally use both conventional parameterizations of the hubble constant , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , depending on the context of the discussion .",
    "the _ einstein observatory _ medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; gioia 1990a , stocke 1991 , maccacaro 1994 ) has been for many years the only large and sensitive x - ray catalog from which an x - ray selected sample of distant clusters can be drawn .",
    "consequently , the emss cluster sample has been under study by a number of groups for a variety of cosmological investigations ( annis 1994 ; gioia 1990b ; henry 1992 ; vikhlinin 1998b ; henry , 1997 ; fahlman 1994 ; luppino & kaiser 1997 ; clowe 1998 ; luppino & gioia 1995 ; carlberg 1997a , 1997b and 1998 ; donahue 1998 ) .",
    "these investigations range from the study of galaxy evolution in @xmath29 x - ray selected clusters , in evolution of the x - ray luminosity and of the temperature function of clusters , in detection of weak gravitational lensing and consequent mass estimates , to determination of cluster virial masses and of the cosmological density parameter @xmath30 .",
    "some of these studies have made x - ray followed up observations of individual clusters using the_rosat _ or _ asca _ satellites ( donahue & stocke 1995 ; donahue 1996 ; donahue 1998 ; gioia 1998a ) .",
    "until the _ rosat _ north ecliptic pole ( nep ) region ( henry 1995 ; mullis , gioia & henry 1998 ) of the all - sky survey is completely identified , the emss is the only large and sensitive x - ray catalog from which an x - ray selected sample of distant clusters can be drawn . even if there are several emss - style cluster surveys working from the _ rosat _ data archive of pointed observations ( rosati 1995 and 1998",
    "; scharf 1997 ; collins 1997 ; vikhlinin 1998a ) , most of these are still works in progress and do not cover a large area of sky ( @xmath31 700 square degrees ) as the emss , with the exception of the vikhlinin sample which covers about 160 square degrees , a fourth of the emss area .    during the course of this survey ,",
    "the total number of clusters in the sample has fluctuated slightly .",
    "we added new distant emss clusters that previously had no measured redshift , but were obviously at distances @xmath180.5 and , from their detected x - ray flux , clearly met our selection criteria .",
    "we also removed sources that , after follow - up observations , turned out not to be clusters .",
    "for example , three of the sources listed in gioia and luppino ( 1994 ) , ms1209@xmath323917 , ms1333@xmath321725 and ms1610@xmath326616 , were removed from the cluster list after _ rosat _ observations revealed the they are unresolved ( ms1209@xmath3239 has been identified with a bl lac object by rector , stocke & perlman , 1998 , ms1333@xmath321725 is a star and ms1610@xmath3266 is still unidentified ) .",
    "there are presently 100 emss sources classified as clusters .",
    "the cluster subsample we chose for the arc survey was subjected to the following criteria .",
    "first , the sources had to lie north of declination @xmath33@xmath34 to be observable from mauna kea .",
    "second , the fluxes of the sources in the @xmath35 ipc detection cell had to exceed @xmath36 erg@xmath37s@xmath4 after converting from ipc counting rates with a thermal spectrum of 6 kev temperature and correcting for the galactic absorption in the direction of each source , but with no ipc point response function correction applied .",
    "third , we restricted our sample to clusters with redshifts @xmath180.15 , and fourth , we required that the x - ray luminosity be greater than @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 ergs@xmath4 to select for deep potential wells which are most likely to exhibit gravitational lensing .",
    "these criteria resulted in 38 clusters spanning a large redshift range ( @xmath41 ) and an order of magnitude in x - ray luminosity ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "for each of the 38 clusters optical , radio and x - ray data can be found in gioia & luppino ( 1994 ) , including wide field ccd images ( @xmath311mpc@xmath21mpc in the cluster frames ) .",
    "although we used x - ray selection to avoid obvious optical selection effects , it would not be fair to claim that the emss cluster sample is completely free from selection biases . as pointed out by donahue , stocke & gioia ( 1992 ; hereafter dsg ) , the emss is not , strictly speaking , a flux limited sample .",
    "instead , the detection of emss sources is limited by central surface brightness .",
    "consequently , there may be a bias toward clusters with centrally peaked x - ray surface brightness since the emss detection algorithm was optimized for detecting point sources in the ipc @xmath43 detection cell .",
    "clusters with more extended emission at lower surface brightness would have been resolved by the detector and may have been missed by failing to meet the minimum detection criterion in the central cell ( note that this problem is more severe at lower redshifts ) .",
    "one might argue that the emss might preferentially select cooling flow clusters ( pesce 1990 ; edge 1992 ) given the possible bias toward centrally peaked objects .",
    "dsg , however , make compelling arguments for why emss clusters can not all be cooling flow clusters ; namely that there do exist non - cooling flow clusters with large @xmath0 and small core radii .",
    "moreover , clusters with large core radii tend to have lower @xmath0 and thus would be excluded from the emss sample for that reason .",
    "additional evidence that the emss does not miss clusters which are not cooling flow clusters is given by the agreement between the x - ray luminosity function of the emss clusters with @xmath180.14@xmath440.2 , and the x - ray luminosity function derived by earlier studies ( piccinotti 1982 ) which use large - beam , non - imaging detector fluxes or with the x - ray luminosity function of the _ rosat _ brightest cluster sample ( ebeling 1997 ) .",
    "the agreement indicates that this bias , if present in our sample , is small , or at least it is at work in the same manner in the non - imaging and in the _ rosat _ data .",
    "imaging observations of the clusters were carried out during the period from may of 1992 through january of 1994 using the university of hawaii ( uh ) 2.2 m telescope equipped with a tektronix 2048 @xmath2 2048 pixel thinned , back - illuminated , anti - reflection - coated ccd mounted at the f/10 cassegrain focus .",
    "the image scale was @xmath45/24@xmath46m - pixel and the field of view was @xmath47 ( @xmath48mpc @xmath2 @xmath48mpc at @xmath18=0.15 and @xmath49mpc @xmath2 @xmath49mpc at @xmath18=0.82 ) .",
    "@xmath50 band images of all , and @xmath51 band images of most of the clusters were acquired using this configuration .",
    "we also took additional @xmath20 and @xmath21 images of a few selected clusters using both the uh 2.2 m and hrcam ( mcclure 1989 ) on the cfht . in total , there were 8 observing runs : may , june , september and october of 1992 , february , may and november of 1993 , and january of 1994 .",
    "the majority of the data are of excellent quality . except for the february 1993 run",
    ", the images were taken in photometric conditions and in good seeing .",
    "the @xmath50 seeing ranged from @xmath52 to @xmath53 fwhm with a median value of @xmath54 fwhm .",
    "the seeing for the @xmath51 images was slightly worse with a median of @xmath55 fwhm .",
    "we chose the @xmath51 and @xmath50 bandpasses for the following reasons .",
    "the @xmath50 bandpass is ideal for observing the distant clusters in the redshift range spanned by the emss sample .",
    "furthermore , the center wavelength of the @xmath50 filter occurs near the peak of the ccd quantum efficiency , and the night sky is darker than in a redder bandpass such as @xmath21 .",
    "although gravitationally lensed arcs are known to be relatively blue , they are still easily detected in the @xmath50 band .",
    "the additional @xmath51 or @xmath20 band images were taken to allow us to recognize any gravitational arcs by their relative blue color compared to the red cluster galaxies .    in order to build up our long exposures",
    ", we used the standard `` shift - and - stare '' or `` dithering '' technique where we took a number of short integrations ( typically 600s or 900s each ) with the telescope shifted @xmath562030@xmath57 between exposures , allowing us to assemble a median - filtered stack of the disregistered images to use for flattening the data .",
    "typically , the set of all images in a single color spanning an entire night , and often an entire run ( @xmath5650100 frames ) , were used to build the median skyflat .",
    "each separate cluster image was first bias subtracted and then flattened with the normalized median flat .",
    "the final image was then produced by shifting the individual images into registration ( integer pixel shifts ) and adding them while cleaning them of cosmic ray hits .",
    "in this section , we summarize the optical , x - ray and radio data for the 38 emss clusters , and describe in detail those sources classified as gravitational lens systems . updated optical coordinates for these clusters",
    "can be found in gioia & luppino ( 1994 ) .",
    "the general properties of the clusters are presented in table 1 .",
    "columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) list the name and redshift of each emss cluster . columns ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) contain the x - ray properties of the cluster : the detected flux in the @xmath35 ipc cell ( @xmath58 ) and total flux ( @xmath59 ) in erg  @xmath37  s@xmath4 , and the corrected cluster x - ray luminosity ( @xmath0 ) in the 0.3@xmath603.5 kev band in ergs@xmath4 respectively . the total flux and x - ray luminosity have been corrected following the prescription outlined by gioia ( 1990b ) and henry ( 1992 ) , which accounts for any extended cluster emission that may have been present outside the ipc detect cell .",
    "this correction can be substantial at low redshift ( @xmath180.2 ) but is small at high redshift .",
    "9.0truein    column ( 6 ) lists the h@xmath61@xmath62[nii ] luminosities ( in ergs@xmath4 ) taken from donahue , stocke & gioia ( 1992 ) who interpreted this line emission as evidence for a cooling flow .",
    "not all of the clusters in our sample were observed by dsg , so only those clusters with an entry in this column have cooling flow measurements . column ( 7 ) contains the 6 cm radio flux measured with the @xmath63 ( gioia 1983 ; stocke 1991 ; gioia & luppino 1994 ) . columns ( 8) and ( 9 ) indicate the quality of the optical data on each cluster by listing the @xmath51 and @xmath50 limiting magnitudes ( @xmath64 ) and the seeing .",
    "we obtained @xmath50 images for all 38 of the clusters , but @xmath51 images for only 22 .",

    "the ( @xmath67 ) and ( @xmath68 ) symbols that precede some of the cluster names indicate those clusters that have giant arcs or candidate arcs and appear in figures 2 and 6 , and in figures 7 and 8 , respectively . for the purposes of this investigation",
    ", we define a giant arc as a large , elongated structure having a length @xmath698@xmath57 and an axis ratio @xmath70 .",
    "we consider both high surface brightness ( `` luminous '' ) arcs and fainter , low surface brightness ones as well .",
    "arclets are simply short arcs ( @xmath698@xmath57 ) with axis ratios 3@xmath7110 .",
    "the clusters in table 1 have considerable variation in their optical appearance , ranging from poor , compact groups to rich regular and irregular clusters",
    ". cases of multiple nucleus cd galaxies , and clusters with optical substructure exist .",
    "eventually , a quantitative morphological classification ( e.g. bautz - morgan ) would be desirable , but such a classification requires galaxy photometry and often spectroscopy ( to verify the cluster membership of the brightest galaxies ) and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we refer the reader to the @xmath50 band optical images published in gioia & luppino , 1994 .",
    "eight of the 38 emss clusters contain giant arcs . to extract quantitative information from cluster gravitational lenses",
    ", one needs a large , homogeneous , well - selected sample of clusters for which there exist measurements of the lengths , widths , radii of curvature , positions and orientations of any gravitational images .",
    "arc lengths and widths are related to the size and ellipticity of the sources , while arc widths are also strongly affected by the steepness of the cluster mass density profile .",
    "the radii of curvature and orientation of the arcs depend primarily on the potential of the clusters , providing important clues about the density profile and mass substructure .",
    "we note that making these measurements and attempting to force the often complex lensing configurations into a simplified geometry is difficult and problematic .",
    "we choose to list the arc location with respect to the brightest cluster member , which is often not the true center of mass .",
    "measuring the arc length , width , and especially the radius of curvature is more difficult .",
    "the arcs often have structure along their length and variation in their width , and are usually too short for an accurate determination of their radius of curvature , @xmath72 . in spite of these difficulties ,",
    "we at least attempt to estimate these quantities and list them in the tables for future use .",
    "we measure the arc total magnitudes by integrating all the flux from the arc to the point where the lowest isophote blends into the local sky background . in some cases where the arc is embedded in the halo of one or more galaxies , the flux from the arc",
    "is contaminated by light from this halo , and we attempt to subtract the halo flux in order to measure the true arc magnitude .    in table 2",
    "we list the observed properties of all the arcs in the eight clusters that contain at least one giant arc .",
    "refer to the diagram in figure 1 where we illustrate the various arc geometry terms .",
    "columns ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) contain the cluster name , the cluster ( lens ) redshift ( @xmath73 ) , and the arc name or label respectively .",
    "the length , @xmath69 , seeing - deconvolved width , @xmath74 , axis ratio @xmath71 , and radius of curvature @xmath72 , are listed in columns ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "the radius of curvature can be determined by measuring the chord length across the two ends of the arc , and the sagittal depth from the arc to this chord , assuming the arc is circular .",
    "column ( 8) contains the distance , @xmath75 , from the ( approximate ) center of the arc to the center of the cluster . often the true cluster center is ill defined , so for our purposes , we take the position of the optically dominant galaxy as the cluster center unless otherwise specified .",
    "the angle @xmath76 listed in column ( 9 ) refers to the angular position of the center of the arc with respect to the center of the cluster , where 0@xmath7 is defined as north and positive rotations are measured in the counterclockwise direction , while the angle @xmath77 , listed in column ( 10 ) , is a measure of the orientation of the arc with respect to the cluster radius vector ( again the ccw direction is positive ) .",
    "column ( 11 ) contains the ( approximate ) position of the center of curvature ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) with respect to the cluster center .",

    "0.5 cm      ms0302.7@xmath321658 at @xmath18=0.426 was the first emss cluster found to contain a lensed arc ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the arc is first mentioned by giraud ( 1991 ) .",
    "mathez ( 1992 ) presented detailed observations of the cluster and 3 arcs : the long ( @xmath81 ) , so - called `` straight '' arc a1 located between the two bright elliptical galaxies g1 and g2 ( in the mathez labelling ) ; a shorter arc a2 ( @xmath698@xmath57 ) to the south of the brightest cluster galaxy g1 ; and a faint arc a1w attached to the western end of a1 .",
    "giraud ( 1992 ) also showed limited evidence for variability in two additional arclets seen in images taken in 1989 and 1991 .",
    "models by mathez reproduce the geometry and shape of the arcs for assumed redshifts of @xmath180.8 and @xmath180.6 for a1 and a2 respectively .    in our @xmath50-band ccd images taken in @xmath82",
    "seeing we can easily see the 3 large arcs .",
    "we do not see the arclets mentioned by giraud ( 1992 ) . in figure 3 , we also show a true color image of the cluster core where we used the @xmath21 , @xmath50 and @xmath20 frames for the rgb colors .",
    "the giant arc between galaxies g1 and g2 ( a combination of a1 and a1w ) is over @xmath83 long and appears to be circular centered on g1 . however upon closer inspection",
    ", we verify that the western and eastern components of a1 are both more - or - less straight and are folded at the point where they join to appear concave .",
    "mathez modeled the cluster potential as a bimodal configuration with the main mass deflector located near the position of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) and the secondary deflector located near the second ranked galaxy to the nw .",

    ", a1 appears to be another example of a `` straight '' arc , but precise measurement of the radius of curvature is difficult .",

    "both the ms0451@xmath60305 arc a1 and the a2390 arc are orthogonal to the optical and x - ray major axes of their respective clusters ( i.e. the arcs trace ellipses aligned with the optical and/or x - ray major axes ) . as we mentioned above , the lower limit on @xmath72 for a1 in ms0451@xmath603",
    "is not significantly larger than the distance to the bcg and is reasonably consistent with the intersection point of the normals of a1 and a2 .",
    "however , if @xmath105 , then , as in the case of a2390 , we require a secondary mass concentration to the east of the cluster where there is no excess of optical galaxies , suggesting the presence of clumped dark matter .    however , a possible alternative way to produce nearly straight , elongated images is with a `` marginal '' lens ( kovner 1987b ) , i.e. a cluster with a relatively large core radius . in such cases",
    ", we would expect to see larger arc widths than with the small core radii clusters , whose arcs would be thin .",
    "since the large arc in ms0451@xmath603 is marginally resolved , we must consider this situation seriously .",
    "note , however , that the orientation of the arc , with respect to both the optical and x - ray major axes , supports our initial statement that the mass density profile is compact , and thus our interpretation that the shape of arc a1 implies mass substructure is the preferred one .",

    "all three appear to be marginally resolved and have no apparent curvature , but they are so short that any slight curvature would be difficult to recognize . furthermore , some portions of these arclets may be obscured by a bright ( @xmath5015 ) star located near the arclet positions .",
    "presumably arclets a2 and a3 could be 2 pieces of the same large arc since lines extending perpendicular from the centers of these arclets intersect at the same point 58@xmath57 to the sw , and the break between the two arclets occurs close to the foreground star .",
    "the length of a2 and a3 combined is 27@xmath57 .",

    "there is some question whether this particular object is truly a gravitational lens image .",
    "the arc appears to be linear , with galaxies apparently at both ends , and might possibly be some kind of tidal tail from an interacting system . if a4 is a gravitational image , then this cluster may have a peculiar underlying mass distribution .",
    "the absence of curvature for a4 suggests the presence of a secondary deflector to the west , where there is no obvious excess of optical galaxies ( see the wide field ccd image in gioia & luppino 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , the orientation of a4 is odd when compared to the more - or - less orthogonal orientation of a13 , although without detailed modelling , it is difficult to say anything quantitative at this time .",

    "allen ( 1998 ) shows that the strong gravitational lensing and x - ray mass measurements for this cooling - flow cluster are in excellent agreement , implying that the thermal pressure dominates over non - thermal processes in the support of the x - ray gas against gravity in the central regions of the cooling - flow clusters , and also validating the hydrostatic assumptions used in the x - ray mass determination .",

    "ms2137@xmath62353 is a good example of an essentially relaxed cluster , as is the case for cooling - flow clusters , with an increasing mass - to - light ratio from the very center to 150 h@xmath125 kpc .",

    "the longest of these structures extends radially 3@xmath57.8 ( 16@xmath114 kpc ) from the center of the cluster to the se of the central cluster galaxy and may be another example of a radial arc ( see fig 7 ) .",
    "we have also considered whether this structure could be a cooling flow filament , since the brightest cluster galaxy has strong [ oii ] , h@xmath61 , and [ nii ] emission , that nesci ( 1989 ) interpreted as the signature of a large cooling flow .",
    "recent _ rosat _ observations have confirmed this cooling flow exists ( nesci , perola & wolter 1995 ) .",
    "when the central particle density in a cooling flow exceeds 56@xmath127 @xmath128 , we expect to see strong optical emission lines ( hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited forbidden lines ) from a @xmath5610 kpc asymmetrically - extended region around the cluster bcg ( hu , cowie & wang 1985 ; cowie 1983 ) .",

    ", the sources will be at @xmath181 - 1.5 and consequently will be very faint with only the most luminous ( @xmath138 ) galaxies visible .",
    "deeper images will reveal faint arcs , if they exist , in these clusters as is the case of ms1137 + 6625 , at z@xmath860.78 , where a system of giant arcs present in the core of the cluster is revealed by a 8700 s long exposure in r - band taken with the keck ii telescope ( see fig . 1 in clowe 1998 ) .",
    "a diagnostic of the mass density profile is provided by the arc widths ( hammer 1991 ) . the observed width ( @xmath139 ) of a lensed arc",
    "is related to the intrinsic source width ( @xmath140 ) through the following relation , @xmath141 .",
    "all of the information on the mass density profile is contained in the so - called matter term @xmath142 which can vary from 0 to 0.5 for compact , singular point mass , singular isothermal sphere or @xmath143 profiles , or from 0.5 to 1 for a non - singular isothermal sphere .",
    "therefore , if we assume that the arcs are drawn from a population of field galaxies whose intrinsic widths are more - or - less constant , then we see that more compact lenses produce thinner arcs .",
    "the majority of the arcs in this sample are thin , often unresolved or marginally resolved , even in 0@xmath57.5@xmath600@xmath57.7 seeing .",
    "thus , we find that the majority of the clusters must have compact cores",
    ". obviously , the assumptions about the field galaxy sizes are critical in this interpretation .",
    "hammer ( 1991 ) and hammer ( 1993 ) argue that faint field galaxies are in general resolved or marginally resolved with intrinsic fwhm of order 0@xmath57.5@xmath601@xmath57 ( lilly , cowie & gardner 1991 ; tresse 1993 ; colless 1994 ) , in agreement with our conclusions .",
    "in addition to the arc widths , the arc locations , curvatures and orientations also depend on the mass density profile .",
    "the arc radius of curvature can be considered to be an upper limit to the cluster core radius ( bartelmann , steinmetz & weiss 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , ( 1993a ) and grossman & saha ( 1994 ) show that when arcs trace ellipses whose major axes are aligned with the cluster major axis ( i.e. the arcs are perpendicular to the cluster major axis ) , then the cluster mass density profile must be steeper than isothermal .",
    "if arcs trace ellipses aligned with the cluster minor axis , then the mass density profile is shallower than isothermal .",
    "when we examine the giant arcs in our sample , we find none that are perpendicular to the cluster minor axis . in four of the giant arc clusters ,",
    "the optical galaxy distribution is clearly elongated , and in these four clusters , the arcs are orthogonal to a radius vector that is more - or - less aligned with the optical ( and in ms0451@xmath60305 , the x - ray as well ) major axis .",
    "the other four giant arc clusters have no obvious optical axis of symmetry .",
    "similarly , the arclets and candidate arcs also tend to be normal to the cluster major axis , in the cases where a cluster has a clear axis of symmetry . from this evidence",
    ", we conclude that in most our examples of lensing , the mass density profiles appear to be steeper than isothermal . of course , in arriving at this conclusion , we are assuming that the optical galaxies are tracing the total cluster mass .",
    "we also point out , however , that several of the clusters ( e.g. ms2137@xmath623 and ms0839 + 29 ) may contain radial gravitational images , which requires a cluster density profile with a finite core radius ( e.g. grossman & saha 1994 ; mellier , fort & kneib 1993 ) .",
    "we have presented the results of our systematic search for lensed arcs and arclets in a large , homogeneous , x - ray - selected sample of 38 distant clusters of galaxies .",
    "below , we summarize our conclusions .    1 .    our survey has yielded 8 clusters with giant arcs , 2 clusters with arclets , and 6 candidate lensing systems .",
    "our results indicate that high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath04@xmath210@xmath3 ergs@xmath4 ) does indeed identify the most massive clusters , and thus x - ray selection is the preferred method for finding true , rich clusters at intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "the majority of the arcs in our sample have large axis ratios , are thin , and in those clusters with obvious optical axes of symmetry , the arcs tend to be oriented orthogonal to the optical major axis .",
    "furthermore , the high lensing frequency in our sample ( 21% giant arcs in the entire sample , 30% giant arcs for clusters with @xmath04@xmath210@xmath3 ergs@xmath4 , 60% for clusters with @xmath01@xmath210@xmath13 ergs@xmath4 ) is consistent with the lensing frequency predicted by statistical models that assume clusters have compact cores .",
    "+ however , our conclusion that the central regions of these clusters have compact mass density profiles does not preclude the presence of large , extended dark matter halos that is convincingly demonstrated to exist through the detection of weak lensing at large radii ( smail , ellis , & fitchett , 1994 ; kaiser , squires & broadhurst 1996 ; squires 1997 ; geiger & schneider , 1998 ; clowe 1998 ; kaiser 1998 ) .",
    "future observations and theoretical modelling will provide important information on these cluster lenses .",
    "we are presently acquiring optical spectra of the clusters and arcs with the cfht and keck telescopes in order to measure the arc redshifts and the cluster velocity dispersions .",
    "these spectra will allow us to confirm the lensing hypothesis , epecially for the candidate arcs and arclets , and will be crucial for theoretical modelling of the more interesting lensing configurations .",
    "we thank the uh time allocation committee for their generous allocation of uh 2.2 m and cfht time for this project .",
    "we also thank john stocke and simon morris for sharing their data , particularly the ms0451@xmath603 redshift , prior to publication .",
    "we have enjoyed fruitful discussions and interactions with megan donahue , anna wolter , pat henry , neal trentham , and with our cnoc colleagues ( e. ellingson , h. yee , r. carlberg , r. abraham ) and others ( n. kaiser , y. mellier , b. fort ) .",
    "we are grateful to all those ( p. henry , b. tully , l. kofman , j. dalcanton , l. cowie , m. metzger , s. miyazaki ) who read and commented on early drafts of this paper , and to doug clowe , who helped with preliminary focas analysis of some of the clusters .",
    "finally , we appreciate the patience and generosity of brent tully who allowed us to `` take an image or two '' during several of his observing runs .",
    "the uh ccd cameras were constructed using nsf grant ast-9020680 .",

    "<S> we present the results of a ccd imaging survey for gravitational lensing in a sample of 38 x - ray - selected clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our sample consists of the most x - ray luminous ( @xmath0 @xmath1 2 @xmath2 10@xmath3 ergs@xmath4 ) clusters selected from the _ einstein observatory _ extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) that are observable from mauna kea ( @xmath5 @xmath640@xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sample spans a redshift range of 0.15@xmath80.823 and includes 5 clusters with @xmath9 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> ccd images of the clusters were obtained in excellent seeing . </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence of strong gravitational lensing in the form of giant arcs ( length @xmath10 , axis ratio @xmath11 ) in 8 of the 38 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> two additional clusters contain shorter arclets , and 6 more clusters contain candidate arcs that require follow - up observations to confirm their lensing origin . since the survey does not have a uniform surface brightness limit we do not draw any conclusion based on the statistics of the arcs found . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that 60% ( 3 of 5 ) of the clusters with @xmath12 10@xmath13 ergs@xmath4 , and none of the 15 clusters with @xmath14 4@xmath210@xmath3 ergs@xmath4 contain giant arcs , thereby confirming that high x - ray luminosity does identify the most massive systems , and thus x - ray selection is the preferred method for finding true , rich clusters at intermediate and high redshifts .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed geometry of the arcs , most of which are thin , have large axis ratios ( @xmath1510 ) , and are aligned orthogonal to the optical major axes of the clusters , indicate the cluster core mass density profiles must be compact ( steeper than isothermal ) . in several cases , </S>",
    "<S> however , there is also some evidence , in the form of possible radial arcs , for density profiles with finite core radii . </S>"
