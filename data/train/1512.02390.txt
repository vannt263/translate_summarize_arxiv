    "high - order finite element methods ( fem ) enjoy an increasing interest in computational science and engineering . they include @xmath1-fem , spectral element methods ( sem ) as well as discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite .",
    "the motive that drives the development of high - order methods lies in their potential to deliver accuracy with lower cost in comparison to the first and second order methods used in common simulation tools @xcite .",
    "however , realizing this advantage in practice is a formidable task .",
    "along with curvilinear mesh generation , the provision of efficient solvers for the resulting algebraic equation systems remains the main challenge .",
    "projection methods for incompressible flow , or implicit discretization of diffusion terms lead to a sequence of linear elliptical problems which are related or equivalent to the poisson equation or , more generally , the helmholtz equation @xcite . fast solvers for such equations are therefore a crucial ingredient of competitive high - order methods and , hence , have been in focus of research for almost 30 years @xcite . for helmholtz or poisson problems discretized on regular meshes ,",
    "efficient multigrid ( mg ) techniques have been developed recently .",
    "@xcite proposed additive schwarz smoothers based on extended element domains , which attain residual reductions of approximately 0.2 within one sweep . they found that weighting the overlapping schwarz updates by the inverse of the counting matrix , which corresponds to taking the arithmetic mean , plays a crucial role in obtaining multigrid - like iteration counts .",
    "a detailed analysis of the method was given in @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a similar multigrid approach for the @xmath2-finite element method on locally refined cartesian meshes .",
    "they used a multiplicative schwarz smoother on element domains which possess only a minimal overlap confined to the element boundaries or , respectively , the corresponding dof . @xcite developed a @xmath2-multigrid method based on static condensation which , apart from pre- and post - processing , reaches linear complexity .",
    "the proposed block smoother can be classified as an additive schwarz method using a monotonic increasing shape function for weighting the overlapping updates . using this smoother the multigrid method attained convergence rates of about 0.02 combined with a run - time efficiency that comes close to fast direct finite difference solvers . unfortunately , despite some progress in factorizing the condensed operators @xcite , the approach is hard to generalize to three dimensions .",
    "yet it inspired us , to extend the idea of nonuniform weighting to the full , `` uncondensed '' problem and thus led to the present work .",
    "our primary goal is to show how nonuniform weighting can be used to boost the hybrid schwarz - multigrid technique developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further we investigate the influence of the overlap width , smoothing strategies , additive versus multiplicative schwarz methods , and krylov acceleration on robustness and efficiency .",

    "for example , with , the accelerated method consistently needed less than half the iteration count of mg for all ansatz orders .    for moderate aspect ratios the improved additive schwarz method the competes easily with multiplicative schwarz .",

    "<S> it is shown that by introducing a nonuniform weighting function resembling a smoothed jump , the logarithmic multigrid convergence rate is improved by a factor of 1.5 to 3 , leading to a corresponding reduction of the iteration count in comparison to the original method . </S>",
    "<S> further , the influence of the overlap width , smoothing strategies , additive versus multiplicative schwarz methods , and krylov acceleration on robustness and efficiency is investigated . </S>"
