    "the fundamental essence of any information protocol resides in the amount of accessible information in a given physical system . in a realistic quantum process , the system is rarely isolated and commonly interacts with an environment , which results in the information being scattered in the typically large hilbert space of the environment . in most theoretical models ,",

    "the dynamics of the system is described by completely positive semigroup maps , or equivalently by the solution of a master equation in lindblad form @xcite .",
    "this formalism assumes weak system - environment coupling , short environment correlation time and a  memoryless \" transfer of information from the system to the environment leading to information erasure @xcite .",
    "such a dynamical model for open quantum systems is called markovian .",

    "more accurately , the system - environment interaction needs to be treated as non - markovian , which tends to deviate from the completely positive semigroup dynamics @xcite , thus making the corresponding mathematical formalism difficult .",
    "incidentally , non - markovian dynamics are not  memoryless \" and allow a backflow of information from the environment @xcite ( cf .",

    "non - markovian processes have been shown to preserve entanglement @xcite in many - body @xcite and biomolecular @xcite systems , and have been exploited in quantum key distribution @xcite , enhancing precision in quantum metrology @xcite , and implementing certain quantum information protocols @xcite .",
    "non - markovianity also plays a detrimental role in quantum darwinism , thus impeding the emergence of classical objectivity from a quantum world @xcite . with recent development of experimental techniques to engineer and control system - environment interactions @xcite ( see also ref .",

    "although the concept of non - markovianity is well established in the classical realm @xcite , its quantum extension is often riddled with inconsistency and subtle variations .",
    "this has led to a substantial amount of literature attempting to quantitatively characterize non - markovianity based primarily on the nonmonotonic time evolution of some quantum information measure ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite ) .    in this work , we propose to characterize the non - markovianity of an open system evolution through the nonmonotonic behavior of a quantum metrological figure of merit , called the quantum interferometric power ( qip ) @xcite , which is defined in terms of the minimal quantum fisher information @xcite obtained by local unitary evolution of one part of the system .",
    "the qip is an important information - theoretic tool that also quantifies discordlike quantum correlations in a bipartite system @xcite and is related to the minimum speed of evolution of a quantum system in the projective hilbert space @xcite . to capture the non - markovianity in open quantum evolutions , we consider a single qubit ( say , @xmath0 ) as the principal _ system _ , interacting with an environment . a second qubit ( say , @xmath1 ) plays the role of an ancilla .",

    "iii , we consider a prototypical single - qubit dephasing model for the two - qubit ( system + ancilla ) state , and show that the non - markovianity measure derived using qip is qualitatively consistent with measures based on distinguishabilty , divisibilty , and quantum mutual information . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider a single - qubit amplitude damping model and investigate the flow of qip in the non - markovian regime .",
    "we observe that the measure appropriately captures the backflow of information and is more robust compared to a non - markovianity measure based on entanglement .",

    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we have seen that the flow of qip for a maximally entangled initial state is determined by the nature of spectral distribution and is equal to the integro - differential function @xmath155",
    ". however , the situation is not so straightforward if the initial system + ancilla state is mixed .",
    "this can be obtained easily from the werner state in eq .",
    "( [ wer ] ) , by setting the werner parameter @xmath165 1 .",
    "in such instances , the flow of qip is still governed by the ( non-)monotonic behavior of @xmath155 .",
    "we observe that the qip ( @xmath85 ) has a dynamical behavior that quite closely replicates the flow of the function @xmath155 , as compared to other measures such as the quantum mutual information @xcite or the entanglement ( quantified by the concurrence ) @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] , shows the dynamics of quantum information measures in the case of an initially mixed werner state @xmath2 , defined for @xmath156 = 0.45 , in the non - markovian regime of the single - qubit amplitude damping channel .",

    "for the considered model , the behavior of @xmath26 closely follows the nonmonotonic and discontinuous evolution of the function @xmath114 .",
    "this is in contrast to entanglement and mutual information , which both evolve smoothly with time .",
    "furthermore , entanglement decays quickly and vanishes for finite ranges of time ( so - called entanglement sudden death @xcite ) and hence can not qualitatively capture the backflow of quantum information in selected intervals of time .",
    "non - markovianity is an ubiquitous feature of quantum dynamical maps , and is nowadays recognized as a resource for certain applications of quantum technology , such as metrology , cryptography , and communication @xcite .",
    "the role of non - markovianity in enhancing the robustness of quantum correlations in systems exposed to noisy environments has been studied by means of various quantitative approaches @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have adopted the quantum interferometric power ( qip ) @xcite as our reference figure of merit to assess non - markovianity of dynamical maps applied to a system coupled to an ancilla , which plays the role of a measuring apparatus for the operations occurring on the system .",
    "the qip has been very recently acknowledged as a physically insightful , operationally motivated , and computable measure of quantum correlations of the most general kind , including and beyond entanglement @xcite .",
    "the qip corresponds to the guaranteed metrological precision that a system + ancilla probe state enables the estimation of a phase shift on the ancilla part , in the black - box quantum metrology paradigm @xcite . when the system is subject to a non - markovian evolution",
    ", the qip between system and ancilla ( measured from the perspective of the ancilla ) can undergo a nonmonotonic evolution , with revivals in time .",
    "we have shown that such nonmonotonic behavior is closely related to , and can precisely capture , the backflow of information from environment to system which is a clear marker of non - markovianity @xcite . in operative terms ,",
    "such a dynamical rise of quantum correlations translates into an increase of the guaranteed precision of phase estimation on the ancilla , thanks to the non - markovian noise affecting the system .",
    "while here we considered paradigmatic dynamical maps applied to single - qubit systems only , it has been shown in @xcite that non - markovian noise affecting a register of @xmath166 qubits can lead to an enhancement in the metrological scaling which is intermediate between the shot noise and the heisenberg limit",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate how the measure of non - markovianity proposed here in terms of qip can be employed to investigate the metrological scaling in the black - box paradigm for quantum metrology with multiqubit probes .    in this work",
    "we have proposed to quantify non - markovianity in terms of the nonmonotonicity of the qip , similarly to previous proposals to quantify non - markovianity in terms of the nonmonotonicity of entanglement or total correlation measures @xcite . by analyzing two simple models of single - qubit noisy dynamics ,",
    "we have shown how our measure reliably captures the non - markovian regime , and is quantitatively more sensitive than measures based on entanglement .",
    "another advantage associated with the use of the qip to characterize non - markovianity , is that such a measure also has been extended to gaussian states of continuous variable systems , resulting in a computable and reliable measure of quantum correlations in that relevant setting as well @xcite . in a subsequent work",
    ", it will be worth analyzing non - markovianity in gaussian dynamical maps @xcite in terms of the nonmonotonic flow of the gaussian qip @xcite .",
    "the qip has therefore the potential to offer a unified picture of non - markovianity extending from qubits to infinite - dimensional systems .",
    "we hope that the present analysis can stimulate further research in order to pin down the relevance of non - markovian dynamics in quantum information processing and in the description and simulation of complex quantum systems in the biological , physical , and social domains @xcite .                      c. addis , p. haikka , s. mcendoo , c. macchiavello , and s. maniscalco , phys .",
