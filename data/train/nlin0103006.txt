    "the multi - soliton complex ( msc ) is a new concept of modern nonlinear science  @xcite .",
    "if we think of solitons as elementary particles , then we can imagine multi - soliton complexes ( mscs ) as combinations of elementary particles such as atoms .",
    "in most cases an atom is an isolated particle , but it can demonstrate more complicated behavior . mathematically speaking ,",
    "a multi - soliton complex is a self - localized state which is a nonlinear superposition of several fundamental solitons .",
    "as it is a composite structure , we can expect it to behave in a more complicated way than a single fundamental soliton . at the same time",
    ", an msc can behave as a single particle unless there is a substantial external perturbation which causes it to split into its primary constituents .",
    "there are various phenomena in nonlinear physics which can be treated as mscs , some of which are listed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we are mainly interested in optical applications . in fiber optics ,",
    "an msc is a single short pulse formed by a nonlinear superposition of fundamental solitons trapped in a common potential well , so that all of them have the same velocity  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear superposition can be either coherent or incoherent , in the sense that the phases of the separate solitons in the bunch can be either related or independent .",
    "the solitons in the group may be bound together , or at least may stay close to each other , simply because they have the same initial speed .",
    "the latter happens in the case of integrable systems .",
    "incoherent solitons in space  @xcite have recently attracted considerable attention  @xcite , especially after the first experimental demonstration of their existence  @xcite .",
    "incoherent self - trapping in a biased photorefractive crystal is usually well - described by a set of @xmath0 coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlses ) with saturable nonlinearities  @xcite . moreover , in photorefractive media with a drift mechanism of nonlinear response , the kerr - like nonlinearity is a good model  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the equations become integrable , and this allows us to obtain solutions analytically .",
    "moreover , the solution can be considered as a nonlinear superposition of a certain number of fundamental solitons and radiative waves .",
    "this fact allows a simple qualitative approach to the problem , in addition to having an exact solution .",
    "the number of solitons in a complex depends on the nature of physical system , as well as on the initial conditions .",
    "mathematically speaking , we will talk about @xmath1 fundamental solitons all having the same speed and moving ( or resting ) as a single complex .",
    "the value of @xmath1 can be  @xmath2 ( fundamental soliton ) but can take large values up to infinity .",
    "elementary particles in nature never exist in isolation , but are submerged in a fluctuating radiation field .",
    "similarly , mscs can exist on top of a background plane wave and , more generally , on top of an arbitrary number of plane waves propagating in different directions . in this sense",
    ", we will talk about _ a sea of radiation modes _ , which can be stable with respect to modulational perturbations in both self - focusing and defocusing media  @xcite .",
    "plane waves can also serve as a basis for the existence of dark solitons .",
    "an incoherent soliton is an example of an msc , and stable propagation of both dark and bright spatial optical solitons on an incoherent background has been observed in recent experiments  @xcite .    in this work we present a class of exact solutions to the coupled set of @xmath0 equations which describe symmetric and asymmetric mscs on a background which is formed from a nonlinear superposition of radiation modes .",
    "this differs from the earlier results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite where the background consisted of a single mode , and refs .",
    "@xcite , where only some stationary solutions with @xmath3-type intensity profiles were considered .",
    "our new exact solution of mscs in a sea of radiation modes accounts for an arbitrary number of both soliton and radiative components .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that , for photorefractive media with a drift mechanism of nonlinear response , a good approximate model describing the propagation of @xmath0 self - trapped mutually incoherent wave packets in a planar waveguide is the set of nlses for a kerr - type nonlinearity @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the @xmath6-th component of the beam , @xmath7 is the transverse coordinate , @xmath8 is the coordinate along the direction of propagation , @xmath9 is the coefficient representing the strength of nonlinearity , and @xmath10 is the change in refractive index profile created by all the incoherent components in the light beam . because the response time of the nonlinearity is assumed to be long compared with temporal variations of the relative phases of all the components , the medium responds to the average light intensity , and this is just a simple sum of modal intensities  @xcite . then , after defining a new set of functions @xmath11 , we reduce eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) to the following set of normalized equations : @xmath12 here @xmath13 , @xmath0 is the number of components , while @xmath14 in a self - focusing medium and @xmath15 in a defocusing material .",
    "let us briefly outline some general properties of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nlse ] ) .",
    "the most remarkable fact is that these coupled equations are _ completely integrable _ by means of the inverse scattering technique ( ist )  @xcite .",
    "specifically , any solution can be represented as a nonlinear superposition of _ solitary waves _ and _ radiation modes _ which correspond to the discrete and continuous parts of the ist spectrum , respectively .",
    "every _ fundamental soliton _ ( labeled  @xmath16 ) is characterized by several eigenvalues : ( i )  a complex wavenumber @xmath17 , ( ii )  a shift in the coordinate plane @xmath18 , and ( iii )  a polarization vector @xmath19 in the functional space , normalized to unity as @xmath20 .",
    "the simplest bright single ",
    "soliton solution in a self - focusing medium ( @xmath14 ) can be written as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the shifted coordinates .",
    "we see that the peak soliton intensity and its inverse width are determined by the real part of the wavenumber @xmath25 , while the imaginary part @xmath26 characterizes the soliton velocity in the transverse direction . moreover , each fundamental soliton can be `` spread out '' into several incoherent components , as defined by the polarization vector .",
    "the solution for a single radiation mode , in the form of a plane wave , can also be characterized by a similar set of parameters , @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "such a plane wave exists for either sign of nonlinearity , @xmath29 , and it is stable in a self - defocusing medium .",
    "moreover , an incoherent superposition of a large number of plane waves can be stable even in the self - focusing medium , as was shown in  @xcite . in the presence of solitons ,",
    "the plane waves are distorted , but due to the integrability of the original equations , the corresponding solutions can be obtained in an explicit form , as we demonstrate in the following section .",
    "it has been demonstrated in earlier studies  @xcite that _ a stationary msc _ can only be formed by _ incoherently coupled _ fundamental solitons and radiation waves which have orthogonal polarization vectors , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "we restrict our investigation to this important case .",
    "then , the mathematical description can be simplified if we use the _ rotational symmetry of the functional space _ of the original eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nlse ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is sufficient to find solutions @xmath31 where all the fundamental nonlinear eigenmodes belong to different components , @xmath32 , and then the full family of solutions can be determined using the following transformation : @xmath33 where the matrix @xmath34 defines a rotation in the @xmath0-dimensional space ( characterized by angles ) , which preserves the msc intensity profile @xmath35 .    as follows from the ist , it is possible to construct the full solution by adding the radiation modes to bright mscs . on the other hand ,",
    "solutions for bright mscs , having a zero far - field asymptotic in the self - focusing medium ( @xmath14 ) can be found by solving a set of linear equations  @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of fundamental solitons , and @xmath38 . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath39 define the relative coordinate centers for the fundamental solitons . by choosing their values in a special way , the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : slau ] ) can be presented in a simple , symmetric form ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    in order to reveal the basic properties of radiation modes under the presence of an msc",
    ", we perform _ a linear analysis _ , assuming that the wave amplitudes are vanishingly small and that they do not contribute to the intensity profile .",
    "we note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : slau ] ) define an extension of the functional basis introduced by kay and moses  @xcite to construct reflectionless potentials .",
    "the difference is that in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath40 are real , whereas we performed a similar analysis and found that the results can be generalized to the case of complex wavenumbers .",
    "specifically , we derived solutions for scattered plane waves , or radiation modes belonging to the continuous spectrum : @xmath41 in general , we can have an arbitrary number ( @xmath42 ) of radiation modes , and we assume that they belong to the components with @xmath43 .",
    "note that solution ( [ eq : scatter ] ) , which is valid in the limit @xmath44 , reduces to a simple plane - wave profile given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : one_rmode ] ) in the absence of bright components . when the radiation wave amplitudes @xmath45 are not small , both the radiation modes and the bright soliton profiles defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : slau ] ) are distorted according to the nonlinear superposition principle . in order to find msc solutions on a finite background , we extend the approach introduced in ref .  @xcite",
    "first , we multiply eqs .",
    "( [ eq : slau ] ) by @xmath46 , add the complex conjugate , and sum over the fundamental soliton numbers @xmath47 . comparing the resulting expression with eq .",
    "( [ eq : scatter ] ) , we obtain the following relation : @xmath48 where the subscript @xmath6 indicates a radiation mode .",
    "the second step is to define the _ combined rotational  scaling transformation _ which changes the nonlinear eigenmode amplitudes while preserving the total intensity profile up to a constant background , @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the full intensity of the re - scaled solution @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the background intensity .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rot_one ] ) , it immediately follows that the rescaling coefficients for the bright components should be defined as @xmath53 while for the radiation modes we put @xmath54 .",
    "quite remarkably , this procedure can be used for both signs of nonlinearity ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the propagation constants should also be modified accordingly , so that the resulting functions satisfy the original eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nlse ] ) .",
    "we finally obtain : @xmath55 at this point , the derivation of the analytical solutions for the mscs existing on top of several radiation modes is complete , and the component profiles are defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u_m ] ) and  ( [ eq : slv_rot ] ) together with eqs .  ( [ eq : slau ] ) and  ( [ eq : scatter ] ) .",
    "all such solutions correspond to multi - parameter families which can be generated with the help of the rotation transformation  ( [ eq : rotate ] ) .",
    "let us now extend the analytical results to the case where the background is composed of a continuum set of radiation modes , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "this case corresponds , for example , to spatial optical solitons excited by an incoherent light source  @xcite .",
    "then , the plane waves in the background can be characterized by an angular distribution function , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , so that @xmath59 is the wave intensity corresponding to the tangents of inclination angles in the interval @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the full background intensity is @xmath61 , and the scaling coefficients for bright components are @xmath62 we note that , for a finite number of radiation modes , the distribution function can be written as @xmath63 , and then expression  ( [ eq : u_m_int ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : u_m ] ) .",
    "the above results are valid for both self - focusing ( @xmath14 ) and self - defocusing ( @xmath64 ) media . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : i_shift ] ) , the qualitative difference is that , in the former case we have bright complexes on a constant background while in the latter case dark dips are formed .",
    "the general analytical solutions can be used to obtain some important characteristics in a simple form . in particular",
    ", we can use the fact that the outcome of a soliton collision , in terms of total intensity , is not affected by the presence of the background . therefore , according to earlier results  @xcite , the interactions of mscs are characterized by translational shifts of fundamental solitons after the collision , and these are given by @xmath65 here the summation involves the fundamental solitons which feature in the collisions with the soliton number @xmath16 .",
    "when the colliding soliton number @xmath6 comes from the right ( i.e. has a larger @xmath7 coordinate before the impact ) , we put @xmath66 while we set @xmath67 when it comes from the left .",
    "the shifts differ for each soliton in an msc . as a result ,",
    "the intensity profile of an msc changes after collisions .",
    "according to the general relation  ( [ eq : i_shift ] ) , the intensity profile is uniquely determined by the eigenvalues of the bright fundamental solitons and the background intensity @xmath68 , but does not depend on the the angular distribution of radiation waves . however , the total intensity of the soliton components , @xmath69 and the intensity of the radiation modes , @xmath70 both depend on the scaling coefficients @xmath71 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u_m_int ] ) . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ir ] ) , each fundamental soliton creates a hole in the background , and the corresponding modulation depth is proportional to the _ bright - dark coupling coefficient _ , given by the value @xmath72 .",
    "quite interestingly , the radiation mode profiles are the same in self - focusing and self - defocusing media , provided the distribution function and soliton eigenvalues remain unchanged .",
    "however , there are some key differences between solitons in self - focusing and self - defocusing media . in the former case , a modulation of the background is compensated by the bright components having larger amplitudes ( since @xmath73 , and @xmath14 ) . on the other hand , in a self - defocusing medium , a dark soliton creates an effective waveguide , which in turn can trap bright components .",
    "such a self - trapping mechanism results in _ the limitation of the minimum dark soliton width_. this happens because the maximum intensity contrast is limited by the value of the background intensity . as a matter of fact , the limitation can be even stricter , since the maximum modulation depth , @xmath74 , can not always reach the value of @xmath2 . then , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : one_soliton ] ) , the characteristic width corresponding to one fundamental soliton can not exceed the value @xmath75 .",
    "the actual limit is determined by solving the existence conditions , which follow from the requirement for the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : u_m_int ] ) to be non - negative , since , by definition , @xmath76 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these conditions involve only the individual wavenumbers of fundamental solitons , and they are automatically satisfied for interacting solitons forming mscs .",
    "finally , we note that the radiation modes are characterized by a non - trivial phase modulation . for practical applications ,",
    "it is especially important to know the _ phase jump _ , or the additional phase shift which appears due to the presence of bright fundamental solitons . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : slau ] ) and  ( [ eq : scatter ] ) , we find the following relation , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the phase jump , and @xmath79 defines the inclination angle of the radiation mode .",
    "then , the phase jump can be found as a sum over the phase shifts associated with individual fundamental solitons , @xmath80 we see that the absolute values of the individual phase shifts are limited to @xmath81 .",
    "however , the total phase jump can become larger than @xmath81 if @xmath82 , i.e. if the msc is composed of several fundamental solitons .",
    "let us now analyse the features of the bright - dark decomposition for a gaussian - type angular distribution , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the characteristic angular width . since the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u_m_int ] ) can not be expressed in elementary functions for arbitrary @xmath85 , we first consider the limiting cases .",
    "specifically , for _ a narrow angular distribution _ , i.e. @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 , while for @xmath88 ( and @xmath89 ) we obtain @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , we expect that , for a fixed background intensity @xmath68 , the modulation of the radiation waves should be reduced ( i )  for wider angular distributions , i.e. larger @xmath85 , and ( ii )  for mscs having higher velocities @xmath91",
    ".    on the other hand , since the phase jump depends on the radiation mode wave number @xmath79 , the excitation of solitons can be more difficult in cases of wider angular spectra of radiation modes , i.e. larger @xmath85 .",
    "additionally , for a moving msc , i.e. when @xmath92 , the dependence @xmath93 becomes asymmetric unless @xmath94 .",
    "for a self - focusing nonlinearity ( @xmath14 ) , mscs exist in the form of bright localized waves having higher intensity than the background , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : i_shift ] ) .",
    "examples of the total intensity profiles and the bright - dark mode decomposition are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sf1 ] and  [ fig : sf2 ] for different values of @xmath85 .",
    "the msc on the right has zero velocity ( with the corresponding @xmath95 ) , while the other msc ( on the left ) has a positive velocity ; thus in the latter case , the corresponding background modulation is smaller , as predicted in sec .",
    "[ sect : gauss ] .    a collision between two mscs",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_collis ] .",
    "this example corresponds to the initial conditions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf1 ] .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the total intensity profile does not depend on the value of @xmath85 , provided that @xmath68 is preserved .",
    "the intensity profile for the collision will be the same for other values of @xmath85 or for other distribution functions . in these examples ,",
    "the msc actually has an intensity which is relatively small compared with the background level .",
    "note that the shape of each msc changes after a collision , for the reasons discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect : interaction ] .",
    "in particular , a symmetric msc becomes asymmetric after a collision ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ] ) .",
    "the presence of radiation does not influence this process .",
    "another feature of a collision is that the lateral shift of the mscs is relatively large .",
    "for example , it can easily be seen on the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_collis ] .",
    "in contrast to single solitons , mscs experience larger shifts in collisions , due to the multiple contributions from all the constituent fundamental solitons .",
    "to describe mscs on a background in a self - defocusing medium ( @xmath64 ) , we first have to determine the existence conditions , as outlined in sec .",
    "[ sect : modulation ] . considering the case of the gaussian distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauss ] ) , we find that , for a narrow angular spectrum , in the lowest - order approximation , the existence condition is @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the minimum soliton width , which is of order @xmath97 , can be achieved if the soliton velocity is zero . in the other limit where @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we have @xmath98 , i.e. the minimum width increases linearly with an increase in @xmath85 .",
    "numerically - calculated existence regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : df_exist ] for two values of @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauss ] ) .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the existence region is very similar to that in the case of a single component radiation field when @xmath85 is relatively small .",
    "however , the existence regions become visibly different when @xmath85 is large .    the minimum soliton width versus @xmath85",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : df_width ] .",
    "this result shows that the distribution function for the radiation field influences the properties of an msc , namely it changes the limiting parameters for the existence of an msc , although the intensity profile of the msc is not directly influenced by the properties of the radiation field .",
    "figure  [ fig : df1 ] shows an example of intensity distribution for the case of a self - defocusing medium ( i.e. dark mscs on a background ) .",
    "we have chosen the soliton eigenvalues to be the same as in figs .",
    "[ fig : sf1 ] and  [ fig : sf_collis ] . according to our general expression  ( [ eq : i_shift ] ) , the total intensity profiles in self - defocusing and self - focusing media are `` mirror - images '' relative to the level of the background .",
    "even the radiation mode intensities coincide in these two cases , cf .",
    "[ fig : sf1](c ) and  [ fig : df1](c ) .",
    "however , the bright component intensities are different , as is clearly seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : sf1](b ) and  [ fig : df1](b ) .",
    "this is a manifestation of the nontrivial nature of the nonlinear superposition of the solitons and the background components .",
    "figure  [ fig : df_collis ] shows the collision of two mscs on a background .",
    "again , we can see that the nonstationary intensity profile created by the soliton interaction during collision is the `` mirror image '' of that for bright mscs in a self - focusing medium , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_collis ] .",
    "the symmetry relation is mathematically exact .",
    "correspondingly , the lateral shift is also governed by the same rules as those for a bright msc .",
    "an important consequence is that the change of refractive index induced by incoherent mscs has exactly the same pattern in cases of self - focusing and self - defocusing media with kerr - type nonlinearity .",
    "this remarkable fact can be used to design linear multimode waveguides and x - junctions with special properties .",
    "moreover , the mscs are controlled by many parameters ( fundamental soliton eigenvalues ) , and therefore a wider variety of requirements can be satisfied in comparison with x - junctions formed by a collision of two solitons .",
    "in conclusion , we have obtained an exact solution for multisoliton complexes on top of a multi - component background composed of radiation waves in kerr - type nonlinear media .",
    "we have identified similarities and differences between bright and dark mscs which exist in self - focusing and self - defocusing media , respectively . in particular , we have found that the intensity profiles in these two cases are `` mirror - images '' relative to the level of the background , and that they depend only on the eigenvalues of the fundamental solitons .",
    "for example , the reshaping of mscs after collisions is determined by the lateral shifts of the fundamental solitons and is not affected by background components . on the other hand ,",
    "the width of dark solitons has a minimum , and this value depends strongly on the angular distribution of the radiation waves .",
    "we have derived analytical estimates of the key soliton characteristics for the case of a gaussian angular distribution of radiation waves , and presented numerical examples illustrating the principal features of bright and dark mscs .",
