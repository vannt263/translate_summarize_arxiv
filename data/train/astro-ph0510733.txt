    "in a study based on long - slit , medium resolution ( r@xmath10700 ) keck ii / vlt spectroscopy of a sample of 10 ultra steep spectrum , high redshift ( @xmath11 ) radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) , we found that these objects are embedded in giant ( often @xmath12100 kpc ) , low surface brightness halos of metal rich , ionized gas with _ quiescent kinematics _",

    "we proposed that the quiescent halos are the gas reservoirs from which the galaxies started to form and might still be forming . at some point , an active nucleus switches on and",
    "the halo becomes observable thanks to strong line emission powered by the ionizing continuum .",
    "our work was seriously limited by the lack of spatial information in directions other than the radio axis , through which the long slits were aligned .",
    "for this reason , we are carrying out a programme of 3d integral field spectroscopy to characterize the morphological , kinematic and ionization properties in two spatial dimensions of the extended ionized gas in a sample of powerful radio galaxies at @xmath92 - 3 .    in this letter",

    "a filamentary component more than 2 \" long is found aligned with the radio axis to within a few degrees .",

    "the uv and optical restframe spectroscopic studies have only marginally detected the continuum , which may still contain significant non - stellar contribution ( vernet et al .",

    "the spectroscopic observations were made on ut 2004 june 17 ( eso programme 073.b-0189(a ) ) using the visible multiobject spectrograph ( vimos , le fvre et al .",
    "2003 ) , on the nasmyth focus of the ut3 vlt unit .",
    "the instrument is equipped with an integral field unit made of 1600 microlenses coupled to fibres , covering 27x 27on the sky with 0.67 \" diameter fibres for the high spectral resolution mode .",

    "the data were bias subtracted .",
    "the expected locations of the spectra were traced on a continuum - lamp exposure obtained before each target exposure .",
    "the fibre - to - fibre response at each wavelength was determined from a continuum - lamp exposure .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using arc lamp spectra and the telluric emission lines in the science data . after these basic reduction steps , a data cube was created for each exposure .",
    "the cubes were then recentred spatially by determining the centroid of a nearby star at each wavelength .",
    "this recentering corrects for differential atmospheric refraction .",
    "the cubes were then combined using iraf tasks , masking the broken and/or low sensitivity fibres . a 3@xmath23 clipping algorithm removed cosmic rays .",
    "the sky background spectrum was estimated before subtraction by averaging spectra of object free areas of the data cube .",
    "the flux calibration was done using the long slit fors - vlt spectrum discussed in vm03 .",
    "cross - talk effects were found to be negligible .",
    "these were evaluated using the field star in the vimos field of view .",
    "the fibre to fibre contamination was found to be @xmath245% for adjacent spectra in the ccd , dropping to less than 0.1% for the 3rd adjacent spectra .    to overlay the radio core position ( carilli et al .",
    "1997 ) on the ly@xmath0 image , we used the nicmos hst image , where the radio core was assumed to coincide with the ir peak .",
    "this is probably not the case if the nucleus is heavily reddened .",

    "details about the observations and data reduction for the _ spitzer _ data will be presented by seymour et al .",
    "( in prep . ) . briefly , for mrc  2104@xmath1242 , we obtained 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0@xmath25 m images on ut 2004 october 27 using the infrared array camera ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) , and a 16@xmath25 m image in `` peak - up only mode '' on ut 2004 october 21 with the infrared spectrograph ( houck et al .",
    "the irac `` basic calibrated data '' exposures were mosaiced using the mopex software package ( http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/postbcd/ ) with the pixels being resampled by a factor of 2 .",
    "we used sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to measure the photometry in a matched 7   aperture defined by the 3.6@xmath25 m image . to obtain total magnitudes",
    ", we applied aperture corrections from in flight point spread functions ( lacy et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a ly@xmath0 image ( fig .",
    "1 ) was created by adding all the frames in the spectral direction of the data cube across the ly@xmath0 emission line spectral profile , covering the @xmath104225 - 4260   spectral range .",
    "the large equivalent width of the line in all positions where it is detected ensures that the contamination by continuum emission is negligible everywhere across the image .",
    "1 shows two spatial components ( sw and ne ) separated by @xmath106 arcsec as previously described by mccarthy et al .",
    "the radio core is located between the two clumps , where ly@xmath0 presents a minimum .",
    "similar ly@xmath0 morphologies have been observed in other hzrgs ( e.g. reuland et al .",
    "the sw component overlaps partially with the filamentary structure described in  1 .",
    "low surface brightness ly@xmath0 emission is detected in regions that seem to be outside any plausible ionization cones .",
    "two spectra were extracted from the two intercone regions shown in fig.1 , where we have assumed a typical cone opening angle of 90@xmath26 and the position of the cone vertex coinciding with the radio core .",
    "ly@xmath0 , although noisy , is clearly detected in the two intercone regions .",
    "any rotation of the axis or reasonable shift of the vertex position leads to some of the high surface brightness emission lying outside the ionization cones .",
    "mccarthy et al . ( 1990 ) mentioned the detection of a diffuse ly@xmath0 halo that surrounds the entire object .",
    "if the gas is ionized ( but see villar - martn , binette & fosbury 1996 ) , the ionization mechanism is an open question .",
    "hot young stars and cooling radiation are two interesting possibilities .",
    "our goal is to map the 2d kinematic field of the quiescent gas ( i.e. non perturbed by jet - induced shocks ) and use it as a source of information about its origin and the formation process of the galaxy .",
    "if the gas motions are gravitational , we can constrain the dynamical mass of the system . because of the high sensitivity of ly@xmath0 to absorption by hi , it is often an unreliable kinematic tracer .",
    "given the low s / n of the data , we can not use other reliable tracers , such as the heii@xmath271640 line .",
    "instead , we have compared the integral field results here with our earlier kinematic study ( vm03 ) based on fors2-vlt moderate resolution ( 6  ) long slit spectroscopy , which made use of both ly@xmath0 and heii .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 the 1-dimensional vimos spectra of the sw and ne clumps using two apertures ( see fig.1 ) matching as much as possible apertures _ 4 _ and _ 3 _ of vm03 . ly@xmath0 in the sw clump is split into two components ( blue ( swb ) and red ( swr ) ) , both of which are well represented by gaussian profiles .",
    "the line fwhm are 470@xmath2120 and 550@xmath2120 km s@xmath19 respectively .",
    "they are separated by 820@xmath2120 km s@xmath19 .",
    "the line in the ne component is well represented by a gaussian profile of fwhm 630@xmath2120 km s@xmath19 redshifted by 250@xmath2110 km s@xmath19 relative to the swr component .",
    "these results are in good agreement with those obtained with the fors2-vlt data .",
    "in particular , the heii line in the vm03 long - slit spectrum of the sw clump shows the same split as seen in the current vimos ly@xmath0 profile .",
    "since the heii line is much less susceptible to absorption , this implies that the double structure is due to kinematics rather than absorption .",
    "we argue that the red ly@xmath0 component from the sw clump ( swr ) and the ly@xmath0 emission from the ne clump are emitted by quiescent gas .",
    "the remarkable similarity in the kinematic properties ( see below ) of these two components strongly suggest that the gas in both regions follows a similar kinematic pattern with the same origin . on the other hand",
    ", the sharp and large velocity shift of the swb component suggests that this is a different , decoupled kinematic component .",
    "although detected almost all over the sw clump , this component is strongest relative to the swr component in pixels adjacent and coincident with the filamentary structure (  1 ) , where strong evidence for jet - gas interactions exist ( humphrey et al .",
    "2005 ) , suggesting that it is emitted by perturbed gas .",
    "we find that the ly@xmath0 profile of the quiescent gas is not strongly distorted by absorption .",
    "vm03 found that in general , although the kinematic measurements ( fwhm and velocity shifts ) for ly@xmath0 and heii can be rather different for the perturbed gas ( usually broad lines ) , they are are in good agreement within the errors for the quiescent gas .",
    "this is also the case for ( see fig.7 , vm03 ) .",
    "therefore , the quiescent ly@xmath0 emission is less affected by absorption ,  probably due   to the narrowness of the lines .    in summary ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission from the quiescent gas ( components ne and swr ) can be isolated in at each spatial location and it can be used as a reliable kinematic tracer .",
    "we now analyse the velocity field of the _ quiescent _ gas .",
    "the ly@xmath0 profile was fit at each spatial pixel with gaussian profiles .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( left ) with the intensity contours of the quiescent gas overplotted .",
    "the errors are @xmath2430 km s@xmath19 for most pixels . the velocity dispersion @xmath23 map ( corrected for instrumental broadening ) is also shown ( fig .  3 ,",
    "the error is estimated to be @xmath2460 km s@xmath19 .",
    "the kinematic pattern is rather symmetric and apparently ordered .",
    "the overall velocity field is very suggestive of a rotating structure , for which the half amplitude of the rotation curve is @xmath28150 km s@xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath23 map is quite featureless with @xmath29200 - 280 km s@xmath19 for most spatial positions , with little noticeable difference between the two clumps other than a slight broadening of the line near the radio core .",
    "if the active nucleus coincides with the dynamical center of the system , this line broadening further supports rotation .",
    "table  2 presents the _ spitzer _ photometry for mrc  2104@xmath1242 , as well as near - infrared photometry from ground - based ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) isaac - vlt ( eso programme 075.b-0729(b ) ) and _ hst _ ( f160w ) images .",
    "we have corrected the near infrared photometry for emission line contamination using archival vlt / isaac @xmath32 spectroscopy ( eso programme 65.p-0579(a ) ) .",
    "we determine the contributions to be 15@xmath215% , 76@xmath215% , and 51@xmath215% to the total flux in @xmath30 , @xmath33 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "4 plots the near- to mid - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the sed shows a clear rise between the @xmath34 and irac 3.6@xmath25 m bands , and again between 8.0 and 16@xmath25 m .",
    "we now argue that the 3.6 to 5.8@xmath25 m points are dominated by an old stellar population .",
    "figure  4 shows that the upturn in the sed between 8.0 and 16@xmath25 m ( see table 2 ) is unlikely to be explained by a stellar population ; the 16@xmath25 m point is most likely dominated by warm dust emission associated with the active nucleus .",
    "we assume the 16@xmath25 m point can be fit with a simple power law of slope @xmath35 ( fig .  4 ) , as determined from a sample of 12 radio galaxies with _ spitzer _ 16 and 24@xmath25 m data ( seymour et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "scaling this power - law to the 16@xmath25 m point implies that we can safely ignore any thermal dust emission at @xmath36 m .",
    "this is further supported by the 8.0@xmath25 m upper limit .",
    "similarly , the @xmath32 points allow us to constrain the combined contributions due to scattered quasar light , nebular continuum and young stellar populations .",
    "these contributions all have a blue slope , while we detect a clear rise in the sed between 2.2 and 3.6@xmath25 m .",
    "we can therefore constrain these combined contributions to @xmath375% in the irac bands .",
    "note that the excess of the @xmath38 band flux over the model predictions ( fig .",
    "4 ) and over the @xmath33 band measurement can only be explained by such contributions , since any old stellar population would be fainter in j than in h ( especially when we invoke reddening ) .",
    "hence our strongest constraint comes from the @xmath33 band detection .",
    "based on restframe near - infrared spectroscopy of low - redshift active galaxies ( e.g. sosa - brito et al . 2001 ) , we expect emission line contributions to the irac bands to be @xmath245% .",
    "we now use the @xmath33 thru 8.0@xmath25 m sed of to derive the most probable stellar mass of the host galaxy ( see , e.g. , yan et al .",
    "2005 for a detailed discussion on uncertainties ) .",
    "the @xmath38-band point is omitted as it appears to be contaminated by light associated with either the buried agn or a young stellar population , and the 16@xmath25 m point is ignored as its likely non - stellar in origin .",
    "we systematically compare the observed sed with a set of templates computed with pgase.2 models ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) via a @xmath39 minimization technique .",
    "star formation histories ( sfhs ) , ages , masses and dust extinction are free parameters .",
    "we model simple stellar populations of different metallicities using a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf with a lower mass limit of @xmath40 and an upper mass limit of @xmath41 .",
    "we adopt sfhs that have been shown to consistently reproduce observations of @xmath42 passively - evolving , early - type galaxies ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1999 ) .",
    "a more detailed description of the fitting method will be presented in rettura et al .",
    "( 2005 , in prep . ) .",
    ".near to mid - ir photometry of .",
    "the @xmath43 photometry has been corrected for line emission ( see text ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     results of the best - fit model are shown in fig .",
    "we estimate the errors for the mass by sampling the full probability distribution in the multidimensional parameter space . we find a best - fit stellar mass estimate of @xmath44 and a color excess @xmath45 .",
    "this is similar to the stellar masses found for the most massive , early - type galaxies at @xmath92 in deep , infrared surveys ( e.g. daddi et al .",
    "2004 , labb et al .",
    "the best - fit age is 2.5 gyr , which is very close to the age of the universe at the source redshift , ( 2.7 gyr ) .",
    "the minimum age that still provides a reasonable ( @xmath46 ) fit is 1.8 gyr , implying a formation redshift @xmath47 .",
    "finally , we note that the sed can not be fit by any simple or composite stellar population without invoking substantial reddening .",
    "let us assume that the giant ly@xmath0 nebula in is supported by rotation .",
    "if its morphology maps the true gas distribution and the gas is settled on a disk , we derive an inclination angle @xmath48 relative to the plane of the sky and a dynamical mass @xmath49 within a radius of 7 arcsec ( @xmath50 kpc ) .",
    "this is similar to the stellar mass inferred from the _ spitzer _ data ( see  3.2 ) , suggesting a surprisingly small dark matter fraction .",
    "however , the derived dynamical mass is likely to be a lower limit , since the gas is expected to be anisotropically illuminated by the hidden quasar . therefore , the disk inclination and the direction of the major axis can not be determined ( e.g. , the gas we see might be close to the minor axis ) .    if the giant halo in is settled on to a well defined disk , then @xmath51 , such that @xmath52 must be @xmath53 km s@xmath19 and @xmath54 . on the other hand",
    ", it takes several rotation periods for gas to settle into a disk .",
    "if this is the case for the giant nebula in and we assume a minimum of three rotation periods ( @xmath55 ) for a well - ordered disk , the 2.7 gyr age of the universe at @xmath2 requires @xmath56 400 km s@xmath19 for which @xmath57 .",
    "smaller @xmath52 would imply that the gas has not yet settled into a stable structure .",
    "it is possible that the sw and ne clumps are two different objects rotating around a common center ( e.g. de breuck et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however the fact that ly@xmath0 emission surrounds the object completely suggests that it is a single , rotating structure .",
    "if the gas is rotating , this means that giant ( @xmath58 kpc ) gaseous , rotating structures ( disks ? ) can exist already at @xmath59 .",
    "these could be the progenitors of the giant ( @xmath60several tens of kpc ) rotating disks discovered around several low redshift radio galaxies and early - type galaxies ( e.g. morganti et al .",
    "high redshift cooling flow models for galaxy formation ( e.g. haiman , spaans & quataert 2000 ) predict the formation of a giant , rotationally - supported disk as part of the process in less than 1 gyr .",
    "therefore , the evolved ( @xmath61 gyr old ) , stellar population revealed by the _",
    "data probably formed well before the disk .    alternatively , the general pattern of the velocity field is also suggestive of radial motions .",
    "the radio properties can discriminate between inflow and outflow .",
    "the ne radio lobe is brighter and more polarized ( pentericci et al . 2000 ) . according to the laing - garrington effect ( laing 1988 )",
    ", this lobe is closer to the observer .",
    "since the gas located at this side of the nucleus is the most redshifted , it must be infalling .",
    "the collapse of such a giant structure suggests that we are witnessing an early stage in the formation process of the central galaxy ( e.g. haiman , spaans & quataert 2000 ) .",
    "let us assume an infall velocity of @xmath62 km s@xmath19 and a radius @xmath63 kpc , where @xmath0 is the angle between the ionized cone axis and the line of sight .",
    "since this is a narrow - line radio galaxy , @xmath0 is expected to be large , @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , after @xmath65 yr , the 60 kpc halo should collapse and disappear in a very small redshift interval ( by @xmath66 ) .",
    "the existence of giant , quiescent halos in radio galaxies at very different redshifts ( van ojik et al .",
    "1996 , villar - martn et al .",
    "2005 ) suggests that they are long - lived structures , unless there are multiple episodes of ly@xmath0 halos .",
    "the implication is that much larger reservoirs of invisible gas must exist and/or some mechanism must deccelerate the infall process at some point ( iono et al .",
    "2004 ) .    as in vm03 and using the geometrical information provided by the vimos ly@xmath0 image , we estimate an ionized gas density @xmath67 @xmath68 ( see vm03 for uncertainties on this calculation ) and a gaseous mass ( neutral and ionized ) within 60 kpc of @xmath69 .",
    "a mass deposition rate in the range @xmath70 yr@xmath19 is inferred .",
    "this infall rate might be able to initiate and sustain central starburst activity at several tens of @xmath71 yr@xmath19 ( iono et al .",
    "since the object contains a @xmath72 gyr old population as well as the young population triggered by the current inflow , at least two episodes of star formation are inferred for the formation of this massive galaxy .",
    "if the halo has @xmath1010@xmath73 @xmath71 , this is probably the maximum it will contribute to build up the stellar mass of the galaxy , so that the infalling gas will only be @xmath2410% of the galaxy mass .    in summary , contains an evolved stellar population that formed at @xmath74 .",
    "the kinematic properties of the extended gas suggest that it is associated with a giant rotating structure , the remnant of the formation process of the galaxy .",
    "alternatively , the gas might be infalling during an early phase in the galaxy formation process . extending a similar study to a larger sample of objects will be very useful to understand the demographics and nature of ordered kinematics in the quiescent gas associated with hzrgs .",
