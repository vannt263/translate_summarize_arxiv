    "then for each of the faces obc , ocd and obd to be being equilateral triangles it is necessary and sufficient to solve for instance the following system :    @xmath26    this problem was solved in @xcite .",
    "we recall the following facts from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "every equilateral triangle in @xmath0 whose vertices have integer coordinates , after a translation that brings one of its vertices to the origin , must be contained in a plane of a normal vector @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) satisfying the diophantine equation    @xmath29    with @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 can be chosen so that the sides of such a triangle have length of the form @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 integers .",
    "a more precise statement is the next parametrization of these triangles .",

    "conversely , there exists a choice of the integers @xmath50 and @xmath51 such that given an arbitrary equilateral triangle in @xmath0 whose vertices , one at the origin and the other two having integer coordinates and contained in the plane @xmath52 , then there also exist integers @xmath36 and @xmath37 such that the two vertices not at the origin are given by ( [ paramone ] ) and ( [ paramtwo ] ) .

    "let us denote this class of objects by @xmath60 and its subset of tetrahedra that have the origin as a vertex by @xmath61 .",
    "obviously we have @xmath62 but this union is not a partition . in what follows we will use the notation @xmath63 .",
    "this latter union is , on the other hand , a partition .",

    "it turns out that @xmath61 is numerous if @xmath36 is divisible by many prime factors of the form @xmath64 , @xmath65 , as one can see from the following .",

    "related to proposition  [ numberofrepres ] , we found a conjecture in a paper posted on the mathematics archives ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this article refers to the number of representations of a number as @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "let us begin by refining the argument used in the proof of proposition  5.3 in @xcite .",
    "that proposition referred to the following figure representing a regular tetrahedron whose vertices are given by the origin , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 :        if @xmath87 denotes the center of the face @xmath88",
    ". then from theorem  [ generalpar ] we know that @xmath89 for some @xmath90 , @xmath39 , @xmath34 odd satisfying @xmath38 and @xmath91 .",
    "let us denote @xmath92 by @xmath93 .",
    "the coordinates of @xmath87 are @xmath94 .            whose positive solutions are known as eisenstein triples , or eisenstein numbers .",
    "a primitive solution of ( [ eisensteintriple ] ) is one for which @xmath101 .",
    "these triples can be characterized in a similar way as the pythagorean triples .",
    "next , let us introduce the notation @xmath106 . if the primes dividing @xmath107 are all of the form @xmath108 ( mod 3 ) then we have simply @xmath109 but in general this set can be a much larger as one can see from proposition  [ numberofrepres ] .",
    "for instance if @xmath110 then one can check the nontrivial representation @xmath111 . for each solution",
    "@xmath112 , in general , one can find eleven more by applying the following transformations : @xmath113 , @xmath114 , then their permutations @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and finally the reflections into the origin of all the above maps @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "we would like to show that for every primitive solution of the equation ( [ planeeq ] ) , every @xmath65 , and every @xmath112 one has either integer coordinates in ( [ fourthpoint ] ) or can choose the signs in order to accomplish this .",
    "a primitive solution of ( [ planeeq ] ) is a solution that satisfies the conditions @xmath39 .",
    "we begin with a few lemmas .",
    "one can see that all numbers @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 must be odd since @xmath39 .",
    "then an odd perfect square is congruent to only @xmath131 or @xmath132 modulo @xmath133 . by way of contradiction",
    "if we have for instance @xmath134 ( mod 6 ) then @xmath132 divides @xmath135 .",
    "this implies that @xmath132 divides @xmath136 which is possible only if @xmath132 divides @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore that would contradict the assumption @xmath39 .",
    "hence , ( i ) is shown and ( ii ) is just a simple consequence of ( i ) .",
    "\\(b ) for the second part let us observe that if @xmath139 ( mod 3 ) then by part ( a ) we must have @xmath142 for some @xmath143 .",
    "this in turn gives @xmath144 which shows that @xmath132 divides @xmath145 .",
    "so , finally @xmath37 must be divisible by @xmath132 and then so is @xmath36 .              in general , the faces of an element in @xmath61 must have normal vectors that satisfy ( [ planeeq ] ) .",
    "but these equations can be very different and one has to go search far enough to find such an example .",
    "for instance , the tetrahedron @xmath156 where @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 has the four faces with normal vectors      [ main ] every tetrahedra in @xmath161 can be obtained by taking as one of its faces an equilateral triangle having the origin as a vertex and the other two vertices given by ( [ paramone ] ) and ( [ paramtwo ] ) with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 odd integers satisfying ( [ planeeq ] ) with @xmath34 a divisor of @xmath162 , and then completing it with the fourth vertex as in ( [ fourthpoint ] ) for some @xmath163 .                    only for one choice of signs .",
    "so , the last coordinate of @xmath84 satisfies the statement of our theorem in part ( b ) .",
    "if the coordinates of @xmath84 are @xmath170 we must have @xmath171 .",
    "so , it is enough to analyze just one other coordinate of @xmath84 . from ( [ paramtwo ] )",
    "we obtain that @xmath172 ( mod 3 ) , and @xmath173 ( mod 3 )",
    ". therefore ,                  * remark : * the alternating behavior that can be observed in figure  4 follows from theorem  [ main ] part ( b ) . indeed , we can start with an equilateral triangle contained in a plane @xmath180 which is one of the tiles and the generator of a regular triangular tessellation . by theorem  [ main ] part ( b ) each such tile from this tessellation is the face of a regular tetrahedron in @xmath181 that is located in one and only one of the sides of @xmath180 .",
    "we denote the two half spaces by @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "let us take one such tetrahedron , say in @xmath182 , and translate this tetrahedron such that the fourth vertex , @xmath84 , becomes the origin .",
    "the other vertices give rise to three vertices of integer coordinates in @xmath183 that are each the fourth vertex @xmath184 for three other tetrahedra living in @xmath183 as in figure  4 .",
    "this type of translation can be repeated with one of the tetrahedra in @xmath183 and one obtains the alternating tetrahedra as figure  4 .",
    "we are going to refer to the figure  2 .",
    "let @xmath87 be the center of the face @xmath189 , @xmath190 be the center of the face @xmath191 , @xmath192 the midpoint of the side @xmath193 , and @xmath194 the center of the tetrahedron @xmath195 ( @xmath25 being the origin ) . since @xmath25 , @xmath84 , @xmath87 , @xmath190 , @xmath192 , and @xmath194 are all coplanar , and @xmath190 and @xmath87 are the intersections of the medians on each corresponding face we have @xmath196 and @xmath197 . by menelaus",
    "s theorem @xmath198 .",
    "this gives @xmath199 and from here we have @xmath200 .",
    "using the law of cosines in the triangle orh gives : @xmath201 which gives @xmath202    so , if the normal exterior unit vectors of the faces rpq and opq are , say @xmath203 and @xmath204 , using ( [ angle ] ) gives @xmath205 .",
    "the rest of the identities follow similarly or from what we have mentioned so far .        the restrictions in ( [ orth ] )",
    "can be reformulated in terms of @xmath207 by requiring it to be orthogonal , i.e. @xmath208 .",
    "it is known that the set of orthogonal matrices form a group .",
    "we also want to point out that in ( [ orth ] ) only two of the exterior normal vectors @xmath209 are essential .",
    "the other two can be computed from the given ones .        for some @xmath212 ,",
    "corresponds to a tetrahedron in @xmath181 containing two faces normal to the given vectors .",
    "it turns out that the answer is a positive one and the proof of it follows from theorem  4 in @xcite .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the diophantine equation @xmath38 always has nontrivial solutions .",
    "we then take @xmath218 in theorem  [ generalpar ] to obtain an equilateral triangle contained in the plane of normal vector @xmath27 . by theorem",
    "[ main ] , case @xmath219 , we can complete this equilateral triangle to a regular tetrahedron in @xmath181 .",
    "taking the normals to the new faces will give four normals and say @xmath220 is one of them .",
    "let us assume that @xmath221 .",
    "we know that there is a @xmath222 such that @xmath223 .",
    "the side length of this tetrahedron is , by our choice of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , equal to @xmath224 .",
    "therefore , from theorem  [ generalpar ] applied to the plane normal to @xmath220 , we get that @xmath225 for some @xmath226 , which implies that @xmath222 divides @xmath34 .",
    "hence we can adjust @xmath220 , if necessary , by a multiplicative factor in order to satisfy ( [ system ] ) .",
