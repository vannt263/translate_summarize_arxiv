    "the parameter @xmath25 determines the proportion of taking into account long and short routes between vertices .    in @xcite",
    "we considered a metric defined by means of the relative forest accessibilities .",
    "the distance between vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 of a ( weighted ) multigraph was defined as @xmath26 . in the present paper ,",
    "we study two parametric families of forest metrics of a graph .",

    "as was demonstrated in @xcite , @xmath65 is nonzero ( and exists ! ) at @xmath66 for every multigraph @xmath10 , consequently , @xmath67 , therefore , @xmath68 .",
    "the connection of an inverse form between the distance and the increment of weight in ( [ deltad ] ) requires some explanation .",
    "note that since @xmath63 can be arbitrarily large , whereas the distance between @xmath38 and @xmath39 should decrease with any increase of @xmath63 , a linear connection between the distance and the @xmath63 can not be expected .",

    "the main difference is in the very _ relative _ nature of the forest accessibility measure : as follows from proposition  7 in @xcite , no distance can increase after the addition of a new edge , whereas the increments of a relative forest accessibility can have either sign . more specifically ,",

    "inversely , if from both @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath38 is `` more accessible '' than @xmath39 ( @xmath92 ) , then the addition of a @xmath50 edge decreases the _ relative _ forest accessibility of @xmath7 from @xmath6 ( @xmath93 ) . here",

    "this equality of scales was attained by putting the coefficient 1/2 in  ( [ metrad ] ) .",
    "the following statement provides simple expressions for the increments of all forest distances and accessibilities when one edge is altered .",
