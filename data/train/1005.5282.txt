    "in the recent years , some interesting and , in a certain sense , unexpected effects were discovered in the experiments @xcite .",
    "namely , a supernarrow absorption line at the frequency of the roton minimum was registered in the spectrum of a dielectric disk shf resonator placed in liquid he-4 . in an external constant electric field ,",
    "the line is split into two ones . at the switching - on of a heat gun directed along a tangent to the disk ,",
    "the absorption line is transformed in an emission line .",
    "these effects have no explanation yet , though the line itself is related , undoubtedly , to a high density of states of he - ii at energies close to the roton one @xcite .",
    "to explain the origin of the line and its specific features , it is necessary to determine , first of all , the electromagnetic ( em ) field of a resonator , as well as the wave functions of a phonon and a roton for helium with an immersed disk . the present work is devoted to this problem .",
    "in the experiments described in @xcite , a variable inhomogeneous field with the strength @xmath1 was induced in a resonator .",
    "the field was mainly concentrated in a disk and created the deformations of a resonator which are pulsating in time and space . however , at the attained values of @xmath2 the total deformation of a disk was very small  at most @xmath3 @xcite for a quartz resonator .",
    "similar weak pulsations should play no role in the phenomena under study .",
    "therefore , it is obvious that a roton is excited by the shf field of a circular em wave pulsating on the rim of a disk , rather than by deformations of the disk . in what follow , we will calculate the em field of a resonator .    in the experiments , the sizes of disk resonators were approximately identical . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the resonators were fabricated of quartz and leucosapphire , respectively .",
    "the results obtained for the shape and the width of a roton line are close , but the numbers of the azimuth mode ( for the roton frequency ) are different .",
    "below , we will obtain the general formulas for the em field of a resonator and analyze the numerical values for the experimental conditions in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the em wave propagating in a quartz resonator with the shape of a disk with the thickness @xmath4 and the radius @xmath5 .",
    "the dielectric permittivity tensor @xmath6 for the quartz under study is diagonal in the coordinate system ( cs ) , whose @xmath7 axis coincides with the geometric axis ( it is also optical ) of a resonator ; in this case , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 in perpendicular directions @xcite .    in calculations of the em field ,",
    "we are based on the maxwell equations in a medium : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the light velocity in vacuum . for quartz and helium , @xmath14 , therefore , @xmath15 .",
    "we now find the vector potential @xmath16 connected with @xmath17 and @xmath18 by the relations @xmath19 @xmath20 we use the transverse calibration @xmath21 and pass into a cylindrical cs ( ccs ) @xmath22 with the origin at the disk center and the @xmath7 axis coinciding with the axis of a resonator . in the ccs ,",
    "the tensor @xmath6 is diagonal : @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "for the field in quartz , relations ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) yield @xmath25 where @xmath26 is some function independent of @xmath27 .",
    "since we are interested in em waves , we can take @xmath28 . with the help of ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the following equation for @xmath16 : @xmath29 for quartz , the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are close .",
    "therefore , we can neglect their difference and consider that @xmath32 , which simplifies the equation : @xmath33 this equation has a solution @xmath16 directed identically at all points of a resonator and another solution directed according to the symmetry of the disk with the @xmath34- , @xmath35- , and @xmath36-components .",
    "it is natural to expect that a resonator amplifies maximally those components of the field which correspond to its symmetry .",
    "it follows from the experiment @xcite that this is true , and , in addition , the principal components of the field @xmath17 near a resonator are the @xmath34- and @xmath35-components , whereas the value of the @xmath36-component is less by three orders .",
    "therefore , we neglect the latter and consider that the field @xmath16 in a resonator and in helium has only @xmath34- and @xmath35-components",
    ".    the equation for the field outside a resonator ( in helium ) has the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( here and below , @xmath40 and @xmath41 mean , respectively , helium and a disk ) . in order to determine",

    "we now calculate the field @xmath16 outside and inside a disk . the general form of a solution @xmath47 is unknown else and , generally speaking , complicated . in principle , the field can depend on the shapes and the sizes of a container and antennas @xcite ( for example , in the experiments in @xcite , two antennas are positioned in the disk plane on two sides from it at a distance of @xmath48 from the disk axis ) .",

    "the solution contains no sines , because the system is symmetric relative to the reflection @xmath50 .",
    "it is known from the experiment that a disk enhances the field @xmath17 mainly inside itself . outside the disk ,",
    "the field is slight , rapidly decreases , and disappears practically at a distance of  2 mm from the disk .",
    "therefore , we assume that the structure of the solution outside the disk is such that we can approximately separate the variables @xmath36 and ( on the other hand ) @xmath34 , @xmath35 according to ( [ 2 ] ) .    since the @xmath36-component @xmath16 is small , we can write @xmath51",

    "the em pumping field creates some field @xmath16 with a given frequency @xmath73 in the disk and outside it , and this field increases in a resonance manner at definite values of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath59 .",
    "we do not calculate the exact condition for a resonance and the width of the resonant @xmath59-mode , because it is easy to establish which modes of ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) are observed with the help of experimental data .",
    "it can be expected that the approximate condition for a resonance consists in the proximity of the em field on the surface of a resonator to zero ( see ( [ gal ] ) ) .    ; @xmath75  the neumann function @xmath76 which grows very rapidly at @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath78 denoted by @xmath79 is shown in this region . @xmath80  the functions @xmath81 at @xmath82 and @xmath83 at @xmath84 present the radial behavior of the field @xmath85 for @xmath86 ( in this case , @xmath87  disk edge , @xmath88).,width=321 ]    experiments revealed various resonance modes , from which the first @xmath36- and the first radial harmonics were studied in detail .",

    "the first radial harmonic ( @xmath92 ) means that the field in the disk is distributed over the radius so that it includes only the first half - wave of the function @xmath69 and becomes almost zero near the disk edge .",
    "therefore , @xmath93 . to be more exact , as @xmath34 increases from zero to @xmath94 the field @xmath95 increases firstly , attains a maximum near the disk edge ( @xmath96 ) , then decreases , and takes @xmath97 of the maximum value at the disk edge ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the first @xmath36-harmonic means that the distribution of the field over @xmath36 is close to @xmath99 . on the upper and lower surfaces of the disk @xmath100 ,",
    "the field @xmath85 is less approximately by 8 times than that in the middle plane of the disk ( @xmath86 ) at the same @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which yields @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "the quantity @xmath106 was defined as the ratio of the frequency to the step between modes , and its value was estimated as @xmath107 .",
    "however , the approximate condition of resonance ( [ gal ] ) implies that the connection between the frequency @xmath73 and @xmath59 is not strictly linear , and the step must somewhat increase with decrease in @xmath73 . by averaging @xmath95 over time , we obtain @xmath108 . according to experiments ,",

    "the resonance frequency is eroded with the formation of a dome .",

    "@xmath227 $ ] ( in particular , @xmath228 ) , it is easy to prove that the wf @xmath229 is characterized by eigenvalues @xmath230 and @xmath231",
    ". however , the momentum for states ( [ vf - ph1 ] ) , ( [ vf - ph2 ] ) is not defined .",
    "we call such states `` circular photons '' ( c - photons ) .",
    "hence , a resonator creates some number of identical c - photons with @xmath169 , @xmath126 and @xmath232 . in space",
    ", a c - photon is localized in the disk and near it .",
    "we note that such a photon _ can not be represented _ as a superposition of plane photons .",
    "indeed , let the em field @xmath213 in helium be expanded in plane waves with the wave vector @xmath233 .",
    "since the disk and helium have different values of @xmath234 a photon , being plane in helium , is reflected from the cylindrical surface of the disk in the form of a fan of diverging almost radial waves and is refracted in a complicated way inward the disk as a system of converging waves .",
    "therefore , photons are not plane in helium or in the disk .",
    "as follows from the laws of conservation , a quasiparticle created by a c - photon in helium must have the same quantum numbers as the c - photon ( energy and angular momentum ) , but it has no momentum in the disk plane .",
    "this implies that a phonon created by a c - photon in helium must also possess the circular symmetry . in this case , a c - photon _ emitted _ by a resonator can be approximately represented as a collection of radially moving almost plane photons , the last being wave packets with size @xmath235 .",
    "such photons can create plane rotons or phonons , if the disk or , as was assumed in @xcite , helium absorbs a recoil momentum .",
    "but this is already a combined process , and its probability is much less than that of the direct c - photon @xmath236 c - phonon process .",
    "in helium far from the disk , ordinary `` plane '' phonons and rotons , being wave packets localized in space , are propagating .",
    "but , near the disk and also far from it in the case where @xmath237 of a phonon is of the order of the disk size , the structure of a phonon must correspond to the symmetry of the disk .    as an example",
    ", we consider a free particle in the space with an infinite cylinder with radius @xmath238 .",
    "we assume that the particle can not penetrate into the cylinder .",
    "therefore , its wf @xmath239 satisfies the bc @xmath240 and the schrdinger equation @xmath241 in the stationary case where @xmath242 the schrdinger equation takes the form of a wave equation @xmath243 solutions of eqs .",

    "these functions describe the diverging and converging waves , respectively .",
    "thus , if an impenetrable cylinder is present in space , the solution for a _ free _ particle is represented by circular waves ( [ c5 ] ) ( with various @xmath59 and @xmath253 ) , rather than plane ones .",
    "the solution differs from a plane wave , because the interaction is indirectly present through bc .    if a disk is present instead of a cylinder , and @xmath254 on its whole surface , then the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) take the other form : @xmath255 @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "like that in section 2 , the neumann function @xmath258 is not present in the solution , since it increases unboundedly near the disk axis .",
    "we now consider helium surrounding the disk .",
    "the microscopic model for he - ii without disk is constructed in the main ( see , e.g. , survey @xcite ) for periodic bcs , as the volume of the system tends to infinity .",
    "the model involves the wfs of the ground state @xmath259 and a state with one phonon @xmath260 .",

    "this requires to construct the full microscopic model of he - ii with a disk , which is a very complicated problem .",
    "therefore , we limit ourselves by the calculation of @xmath0 for an infinite system without regard for bcs . but , in this case , it will be necessary in certain situations to pass from @xmath261 to the sum @xmath262 and to know the value of @xmath260 on boundaries . to his end",

    "here , @xmath269 is the radius of a container with helium , and @xmath270 depends on @xmath271 : for the least @xmath126 relation ( [ bc5 ] ) yields @xmath272 and @xmath270 decreases to @xmath273 with increase in @xmath271 . at small",
    "@xmath271 ( @xmath274 ) , there exists no solution @xmath265 , for which the relations @xmath257 and @xmath275 from ( [ bc2 ] ) would be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "however , the symmetry of the system deviates from the cylindrical one near the container walls .",
    "therefore , the relation @xmath275 should not apparently hold , and only @xmath257 is valid .",
    "this yields @xmath276 the last relation can be rewritten in the form of ( [ bc4 ] ) , by introducing @xmath270 . though conditions ( [ bc1])([bc5 ] ) will be used , we will find the wf of a phonon in a simpler approximation , by neglecting the bcs ( as usually the micromodels of he - ii are constracted @xcite ) .",
    "it follows from the @xmath277-particle schrdinger equation that if the wf of the ground state of he - ii is represented in the form @xmath278 , then the wf @xmath279 of a plane ( p- ) or circular ( c- ) phonon satisfies the equation @xmath280        \\psi_{\\textbf{k}}=e(\\textbf{k})\\psi_{\\textbf{k}}.       \\label{c10}\\ ] ] we now consider the zero approximation without any interaction between atoms . in this case ,",
    "@xmath281=const , and ( [ c10 ] ) is reduced to @xmath282 which is the schrdinger equation for @xmath277 free particles . for a translationally invariant system in the case where a single particle has a momentum @xmath283 , and the rest ones are immovable",
    ", a solution of the equation looks as @xmath284 where @xmath285 are the `` plane '' collective variables , and @xmath286 is the helium atom mass .",
    "this solution serves as the zero approximation for the wf of a p - phonon .",
    "the consideration of the interaction leads , as known , to the transformation of the one - particle excitations ( [ c12 ] ) to collective ones : @xmath279 acquires corrections nonlinear in @xmath287 and @xmath288 is replaced by a more complicated dispersion law for quasiparticles . if a disk is present in helium , the translational symmetry is broken , but the circular symmetry holds .",
    "therefore , according to ( [ c4 ] ) and ( [ c6 ] ) , the solution of ( [ c11 ] ) is the wf @xmath289 it is the zero approximation to the wf of a circular phonon in helium - ii with the immersed disk ( the summation is made over all atoms ) .",
    "we omit the neumann function , since namely function ( [ c9 ] ) is a solution under the most correct zero bcs .",
    "the consideration of the interaction between atoms will lead to the appearance of corrections to ( [ c9 ] ) which are nonlinear in @xmath290 but we will neglect them . in ( [ c9 ] ) , @xmath291 means the circular collective variables .",
    "the following question is of importance : does the energy @xmath292 of a c - phonon coincide with the energy @xmath293 of a p - phonon at the same @xmath294 ? for a free particle ( eq .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) ) , the energy depends only on @xmath294 ( but not on @xmath295 and @xmath265 separately ) .",
    "analogously , the energy of a c - phonon must depend only on @xmath294 .",
    "but , at @xmath296 a c - phonon is close to a p - phonon , and , hence , its energy must be close to the energy of a p - phonon , by differing proportionally to smallest @xmath297 .",
    "therefore , for any other @xmath298 the energy of a c - phonon must also be close to the energy @xmath293 of a p - phonon .",
    "generally speaking , the exact equality @xmath299 is possible as well .",
    "acting by the momentum operator @xmath300 on the wf of a c - phonon ( [ c9 ] ) , we verify that a c - phonon possesses the intrinsic momentum @xmath301 .",
    "thus , in what follows , we will use the zero approximation ( [ c9 ] ) and the conditions of quantization ( [ bc3])([bc5 ] ) for the wf of a c - phonon .",
    "as seen from ( [ c9 ] ) , we need to know the coefficient @xmath302 ( below , @xmath303 ) for the wf of a c - phonon",
    ". we will determine it from the condition of normalization @xmath304 where @xmath305 , and @xmath306 are coordinates of the @xmath307-th atom . using ( [ c9 ] ) , we have @xmath308 @xmath309 @xmath310 in the real experiment , the disk is positioned in helium between two long cylindrical rods - antennas located in the disk plane at a distance of @xmath311 from the disk center . near the antennas , a phonon wave loses the circular shape .",
    "but the analytic calculation of a new shape is a quite difficult problem , and we will neglect the difference of the symmetry of the system from the cylindrical one , by considering that the container with helium is a cylinder with radius @xmath269 and height @xmath312 ( then the helium volume @xmath313 ) .",
    "as known , the pair correlation function @xmath314 determining the probability for atom 1 to be at a point @xmath315 and for atom 2 to be at a point @xmath316 is presented by the integral @xmath317 for a translationally invariant system , @xmath318 . in our case , a disk positioned in he - ii breaks the translational invariance .",
    "but , at small @xmath319 the function @xmath314 is determined by the interaction of the nearest atoms , so that it should depend in helium with a disk only on the difference @xmath320 , if @xmath315 and @xmath316 are not too close to the disk . for a region near the disk ( at distances of about several interatomic ones ) , @xmath321 .",
    "but it is a very thin layer which hardly influences the processes in bulk .",
    "therefore , we accept that the relation @xmath322 is always true , and , hence , @xmath323 for atoms which are not located at the disk surface , the relation @xmath324e^{-i\\textbf{k}\\textbf{r}}d\\textbf{r }            \\label{n11}\\ ] ] obtained for translationally invariant systems is also valid . in addition , if @xmath315 is far from the disk , then the relation @xmath325 is true .",
    "indeed , this integral determines the probability to find atom 1 at the point @xmath315 , and it is obvious that the probability for all points far from the disk is the same . with regard for ( [ n5 ] ) , we obtain that integral ( [ n3 ] ) is @xmath326 where @xmath327    we note that the bessel functions satisfy the relation @xcite @xmath328 ^ 2 ,       \\label{n7 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath329 is the kronecker symbol , and @xmath330 .",

    "@xmath355 @xmath356 ( @xmath357 is arbitrary ; ( [ n14 ] ) follows from ( [ n11 ] ) ) , let us write the vector @xmath358 in the ccs .",
    "then integral ( [ n4 ] ) reads @xmath359 \\nonumber \\\\               & \\times & j_{l}(k_{\\rho}\\rho_{1})j_{l}(k_{\\rho}\\rho_{2})j_{l}(q_{\\rho}\\rho_{1})j_{l}(q_{\\rho}\\rho_{2 } ) .",

    ", we finally get @xmath363 by using relations ( [ n1 ] ) , ( [ n2 ] ) , ( [ n6 ] ) , and ( [ n16 ] ) , we obtain the required result for the normalization of the wf of a c - phonon : @xmath364 where @xmath365 .",
    "this formula is approximately true also for arbitrary @xmath265 which is not quantized according to ( [ bc4 ] ) and ( [ bc5 ] ) .",
    "we note that , while integrating , we do not consider that helium atoms can not be present in the volume occupied by the disk , but taking this circumstance into account does not practically change the integrals and result ( [ n18 ] ) .",
    "thus , we have determined the distributions of the electromagnetic field inside and outside a resonator , as well as the wave function of a circular phonon . without these quantities",
    ", it is impossible to calculate the shf absorption spectrum of liquid helium which arises due to the creation of quasiparticles in helium by the field of a resonator . in our opinion , just the mutual transformation of excitations with the circular symmetry ( photon @xmath366 phonon or photon @xmath366 roton ) allows one to understand the process of absorption in helium with an immersed disk resonator , when the momentum conservation law is formally broken , and it is necessary to determine which quantum numbers of created and disappeared quasiparticles must be conserved . the calculation of the probabilities of relevant transitions and the description of the phenomena discovered in experimental works @xcite are planned to present in the subsequent publications .",
