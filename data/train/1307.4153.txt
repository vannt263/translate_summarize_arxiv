    "over the past fifteen years , there has been an intense interest on the dynamics of nonlinear waves and coherent structures that arise in the atomic physics realm of bose - einstein condensates  @xcite . a large component to the appeal of such states",
    "has been the apparent simplicity and controllability of this setting , which at the mean field level can be well approximated by the so - called gross - pitaevskii equation where such states as solitary waves and vortices have been widely explored  @xcite . among the relevant coherent structures , vortices have , arguably ,",
    "held a prominent position , perhaps in part due to the tantalizing analogies to earlier studies of their existence in fluids ; relevant research activity focusing on vortices has now been summarized in multiple works  @xcite .",
    "some of the early interest in vortex structures has been centered around their experimental realization in various distinct ways .",
    "additionally , vortices of higher topological charge were produced and their decay was explored  @xcite .",
    "finally , large scale lattices featuring triangular symmetry were demonstrated as the emerging ground state of the system under fast rotation  @xcite .",
    "after what could be considered as a partial experimental research hiatus in the middle of the last decade , a series of recently devised techniques shifted the interests within the paradigm of vortices in becs and gave rise to new possibilities accessible both in their creation and in their monitoring .",
    "in particular , the possibility to create the vortices by quenching through the condensation quantum phase transition  @xcite was coupled to minimally destructive imaging techniques  @xcite and enabled the visualization of single vortex precessions but also multi - vortex interactions .",
    "the latter included both the case of the counter - circulating vortex dipole  @xcite , but also more recently that of co - rotating sets of @xmath1 vortices  @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath2 was also explored through different experimental techniques , involving the excitation of a quadrupolar mode in ref .  @xcite .",
    "while such few vortex clusters were created early on in the experimental history of atomic becs  @xcite and were intensely studied theoretically  @xcite , these recent works have shed new light into relevant static and dynamic possibilities that has , in turn , motivated further theoretical analysis  @xcite .    our principal aim in the present work is to revisit and expand upon the recent experimental , computational and theoretical discussion of ref .",
    "given that the latter work offers a well established framework of ordinary differential equations for tracking the vortex motion , here we wish to advance to the extent possible our state of understanding of such low dimensional reductions of the system by employing a variety of computational and theoretical tools .",
    "in particular , on the computational side , we interweave two different approaches .",
    "on the one hand , we use a monte - carlo ( mc ) based technique involving a twist of a reparametrization method for the vortex `` particles '' based on hyperspherical coordinates .",
    "this approach will prove extremely efficient in unveiling the ground state of the system .",
    "on the other hand , we use the computational software package auto  @xcite in order to provide a the bifurcation picture for the cases of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the combination of the two methods sheds further light on the parameter values ( in this case , the angular momentum as discussed below ) for which the mc jumps from one type of solution to a next .",
    "we corroborate these results by systematic analytical results on the co - rotating vortex states , whereby we explore not only the stability of the most standard polygonal state  @xcite , but also explore by - products of the bifurcations thereof . in the case of @xmath3 , these are asymmetrically located anti - diametric vortices , for @xmath2 , they form isosceles as opposed to equilateral triangles , for @xmath4 , rhombi emerge instead of squares , etc .    our presentation is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the basic equations associated with the vortex dynamics and their mathematical framework ( conserved quantities etc . ) . in section iii",
    ", we analyze the monte - carlo method used to address the ground state solutions of this system of equations . in section iv",
    ", we present our numerical and analytical results , separating the cases of @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and even briefly touching upon @xmath5 .",
    "finally , in section v , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions as well as a number of directions of interest for future studies .",
    "for the recent experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued by a combination of numerical and theoretical results ( see for related recent analyses also the works of refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the dynamics for @xmath6 singled - charged bec vortices trapped in an axially symmetric magnetic trap can be described by the following system of differential equations : @xmath7 \\notag \\dot{\\theta}_{i } & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{s_{i}}{1-r_i^2 } +   c\\ , \\sum_{i \\neq j } s_j \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\rho_{ij}^2 } - \\frac{r_j}{r_i\\,\\rho_{ij}^2 } \\cos(\\theta_i-\\theta_j ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the charge of vortex @xmath9 and its position , rescaled by the thomas - fermi ( tf ) cloud radius @xmath10 , is given in polar coordinates by @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the distance between vortices @xmath9 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is an adimensional parameter accounting for the ratio of the rotation frequency of two same charge vortices ( @xmath15 when the vortices are separated by a distance @xmath16 again measured in units of @xmath10 ) and the rotational precession induced by the magnetic trap .",
    "the precession of a single vortex about the trap center can be approximated by @xmath17 , where the frequency at the trap center is @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the chemical potential , and @xmath20 is a numerical constant  @xcite .    in the remainder of our work",
    "we will consider small clusters of vortices @xmath21 with _ same _ charge . without loss of generality",
    "we consider @xmath22 since the case @xmath23 corresponds to exactly the same dynamics if @xmath24 .",
    "it is straightforward to prove that the system of odes ( [ odes ] ) possesses two conserved quantities corresponding to the angular momentum @xmath25 and hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "the angular momentum assumes the form : @xmath27 and the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath28 it is worth mentioning that it is possible to reduce this hamiltonian to @xmath29 degrees of freedom by using the conservation of angular momentum ( [ l ] ) and introducing it as a parameter and by defining the relative angles @xmath30 and thus effectively eliminating the polar angle of , let us say , the first vortex by placing our dynamics in a frame rotating with the first vortex .    from a mathematical viewpoint the parameter @xmath31",
    "might be chosen arbitrarily . however , all throughout our study we will use the nominal value @xmath32 that has been shown to accurately describe the experimental values for the quasi-2d case of rubidium atoms under the experimental trapping conditions of , e.g. , ref .",
    "it was also argued therein that variations of the number of atoms of the condensate system would only have a logarithmically weak effect on @xmath31 , hence preserving this constant value of @xmath31 provides a reasonable approximation . for this fixed value of @xmath31",
    "we will vary the angular momentum between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i.e. , we will use the angular momentum as our _ bifurcation parameter_.    at this point we should mention that it is straightforward to show that the first of eqs .",
    "( [ odes ] ) can be written in vector form as follows : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the unit vector along @xmath37-direction .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : vectr2 ] ) has a straightforward geometric interpretation : each @xmath38 is conserved if the cross - product in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vectr2 ] ) vanishes ; this is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the existence of a fixed point .",
    "there are two obvious cases for this cross product to become zero :    * the @xmath39 s are all collinear . *",
    "the @xmath39 define a regular polygon of order @xmath6 inscribed in a circle of radius @xmath40 .",
    "since the first case does _ not _ satisfy the second one of eqs .",
    "( [ odes ] ) for general @xmath6 , we restrict our considerations to the second , more interesting candidate , namely the polygonal case . to establish its relevance ,",
    "let the center of the polygon be at the origin of the axes in @xmath41-plane , and the considered polygon edge ( @xmath9 ) lie at the positive @xmath42-axis",
    ". if @xmath6 is odd , all terms in the sum @xmath43 can be grouped into doublets ( axially symmetric with respect to the @xmath42-axis ) , such that their sum forms a vector parallel ( or anti - parallel ) to @xmath39 , thus leading to the vanishing of the associated cross - product .",
    "if @xmath6 is even , the grouping in doublets is possible for all @xmath13 except of one which is anti - parallel to @xmath39 .",
    "thus in either case ( @xmath6 odd or even ) the cross - product vanishes and , therefore ,    the @xmath38 are conserved in this case .",
    "additionally , for small enough @xmath6 , e.g. , for @xmath3 or @xmath2 , if the vanishing of the cross product holds then the fixed - point equations for the polar angles @xmath44 are fulfilled as well .",
    "in fact , in such cases , one can obtain analytical expressions for the fixed point configurations .",
    "however , we should emphasize that these considerations only refer to the existence but _ not _ to the stability of the relevant symmetric configurations ( e.g. , equilateral or isosceles triangles for @xmath2 ) .",
    "for @xmath45 the equations resulting from the vanishing of the cross product are less in number than the ones necessary to uniquely determine the fixed point configurations : this is due to the fact that there exist @xmath6 equations for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 , hence it is not straightforward to generalize this intriguing geometric interpretation beyond @xmath2 . our `` deterministic '' computational approach in seeking rigidly rotating states of the vortex particles ( effectively steady states in their relative angle variables )",
    "will be based on the well - established continuation / bifurcation software auto  @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss auto further here , but direct the interested reader to relevant resources mentioned above .",
    "instead , we now provide more details on our monte - carlo approach to identifying the system s ground state as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "we employ the metropolis monte carlo ( mc ) algorithm for obtaining the minimum energy state configurations of the vortices @xmath49 of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) for different numbers of vortices @xmath6 . in order to exploit the conservation of the angular momentum ,",
    "we introduce it as a parameter @xmath25 in the simulations and generate the @xmath50 s through hyperspherical coordinates , thus enforcing the constraint @xmath51 . due to the singularity of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) as @xmath52 , for our purposes we have had to restrict the values of @xmath25 in the interval @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "it should be noted here that the idea of using mc type approaches for particles interacting with logarithmic potentials ( and also sustaining an external confinement ) stemmed from the pioneering study of ref .",
    "@xcite , which , in turn , was motivated by experiments ( and phase transitions observed ) on systems of confined charged metallic balls  @xcite .    in particular ,",
    "we begin with setting four different initial configurations : the symmetric configuration , i.e. , @xmath54 and three random ones .",
    "we then implement the metropolis algorithm at an ( artificial ) ultra low temperature @xmath55 , for each initial condition , until we reach equilibrium , a fact that is checked by the convergence of the energy time series for the different random walks .",
    "each monte carlo step consists of the following procedural steps .    *",
    "( 1 ) * we choose new configurations @xmath56 such that they satisfy the constraints @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ". a useful parametrization of the first condition in terms of the hyperspherical coordinates is defined through the relations : @xmath59 note that we arrive at @xmath60 independent angles and thus @xmath61 is completely determined by the knowledge of the other @xmath62 s . in the following",
    "we denote the prefactors of @xmath63 with @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "we have to also fulfill the second constraint .",
    "it is easily shown that the requirement @xmath66 is fulfilled , without loss of generality , by constraining the angles @xmath67 to the first quadrant , thus if @xmath68 . in order to satisfy the condition @xmath69 we need : @xmath70 however , since the @xmath62 are determined recursively we also need to ensure that with a random choice of @xmath71 all the @xmath62 s can be less than @xmath34 .",
    "this is not trivial especially for large values of @xmath25 .",

    "( 3 ) * if @xmath90 the new configuration is accepted , i.e. @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "otherwise , we accept the new configuration with a probability @xmath93 given by the boltzmann factor @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .    after reaching equilibrium , in our case typically after @xmath96 mc steps",
    ", we have practically the configurations for @xmath97 , i.e. , the minimum energy configurations sought . in order to optimize our results in this step",
    "we perform a final mc simulation at @xmath98 .",
    "this deterministic local search reduces some of the fluctuations and allows us to obtain the minimum configuration with a desirable accuracy , which in our simulations leads to an error of order @xmath99 .",
    "we remark that the mc algorithm always converges to a minimum but it does not distinguish between local and global ones . in order to handle this problem usually a large number of initial conditions , or the use of more sophisticated techniques like simulated annealing are required .",

    "since this solution exists only above this critical point , it can be inferred that the primary instability of the square configuration leads to a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation that , in turn , results in the emergence of the rhombic state .",

    "[ n4 ] reveals for a few points between @xmath149 and @xmath150 the transition from the square to the rhombi ( although the growth rate of the associated instability in this interval is apparently so weak that the mc may still converge to the squares for some values of @xmath100 within this interval ) . on the other hand , we also depict the relevant bifurcation for the relative angles @xmath128 in fig .",
    "[ n4pi ] . remarkably but also naturally , between @xmath149 and @xmath150 , and while the radii reveal ( at least partially ) the transition from the squares to the rhombi , @xmath151 remains invariant at @xmath152 , as it is shared by both configurations .",
    "hence , it is clear that one can not use solely the radii or solely the relative angles , but a careful inspection of both unveils the full picture of configurational transitions .",
    "for slightly higher values of the angular momentum , i.e. , for @xmath153 , the monte - carlo jumps to another configuration which in this case does not appear to have any definite symmetry .",
    "while the relative angles @xmath128 , as discussed above , were unable to `` discern '' the first transition ( the supercritical pitchfork from the square to the rhombus ) , nevertheless , they clearly distinguish the second transition , whereafter none of the angles is equal to @xmath152 .",
    "it should be clear at this point that , as in the @xmath2 case , in the @xmath4 examples as well , the dynamical picture offers a particularly useful complementing view which corroborates in an insightful manner the results of the monte - carlo approach .",
    "in particular , we clearly observe the transition from the square to the rhombus .",
    "the latter state , however , is apparently the ground state of the @xmath4 system only for a small interval of angular momenta .",
    "this is because already for @xmath154 a pair of asymmetric ( so - called irregular ) quadrilaterals of vortices arise with unequal sides , yet rigidly rotating around the center of the trap . remarkably , one of the highly asymmetric configurations that arise in this saddle - center bifurcation is dynamically stable and it is that one that becomes the global energy minimum beyond the second critical point , namely @xmath155 . for these quadrilaterals",

    "i.e. , the full dynamics and stability picture is far more complicated , involving a series of bifurcations , a super - critical and a sub - critical pitchfork , as well as a saddle - center bifurcation , yet again the combination of the monte - carlo method and the bifurcation analysis yields a complete understanding of the system s ground state features .    finally , in order to more precisely illustrate the feature that the mc simulation is indeed converging to the stable state with minimum energy , we have followed the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) as the angular momentum is varied .",

    "nevertheless , we have still been able to analyze the stability of the pentagon configuration with @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "such configurations will be stable , remarkably , until the same principal critical point as were @xmath2 and @xmath4 polygons , namely @xmath171 , although , of course this corresponds to a higher angular momentum for this case , namely @xmath172 .",
    "on the other hand , we have also been able to identify a second critical point which arises at @xmath173 , i.e. , at a higher radius .",
    "this first critical point occurs analytically at @xmath174 , while the monte - carlo numerically appears to deviate from the pentagon configuration for the earlier value of @xmath175 .",

    "in fact , apparently , for values of the angular momentum in @xmath176 , the configuration bearing a single vortex at the center surrounded by a square of vortices has less energy than the pentagon . for larger values of the angular momentum , @xmath177 , the asymmetric configuration bearing a tight cluster of four vortices near the origin and a single vortex further away from the center , corresponds to the lowest energy configuration of the system .",

    "building on the earlier establishment of a relevant model through comparisons with experimental results , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite , we developed both a monte - carlo approach targeting the lowest energy states and an auto - based dynamical systems approach attempting to infer the relevant solutions and their pitchfork and saddle - center bifurcations into existence / termination . by corroborating the two techniques and using the angular momentum as a parameter , and the energy as well as the vortex positions as diagnostics",
    ", we were able to provide a full picture of how two rigidly rotating vortices remain anti - diametric but become asymmetric , three rigidly rotating vortices prefer to be in an isosceles rather than equilateral triangle , while four turn from squares to rhombi and from there to irregular quadrilaterals .",
    "all these transitions have been quantified as a function of increasing angular momenta and ultimately result from the competition of the two energetic contributions in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , namely the precession of each vortex due to the trap and the pairwise interaction between the vortices .",
    "whenever possible the numerical observations have been complemented by analytical solutions ( e.g. identifying the destabilization points of symmetric configurations , or analytically characterizing the bifurcating solutions such as isosceles triangles and rhombi ) .",
    "nevertheless , naturally many open questions still remain and the system clearly merits further investigation . as an appetizer towards that direction , we presented the calculation of @xmath5 , indicating a clearly subcritical event that must be leading to the destabilization of the pentagons .",
    "our computational approaches have natural limitations that arise both for the dynamical systems auto - based analysis and for the monte - carlo efficient ground state tracking method .",
    "we now briefly discuss these limitations and present a view towards overcoming them in the future which would indeed enable a systematic categorization of larger vortex particle clouds .",
    "on the one hand , the auto calculation is extremely useful in identifying the relevant bifurcations , but given that it tracks the different branches of solutions , it provides a progressively more complex and difficult to parse picture as @xmath6 is increased .",
    "hence , it is necessary to use multiple and different suitably chosen diagnostics in order to be able to systematically scale up the picture to cases of larger @xmath6",
    ". it would be particularly meaningful of a task to try to develop such diagnostics and it is part of our currently ongoing effort .",
    "on the other hand , the monte - carlo approach suffers from a different limitation most notably the divergence of vortex precessional frequencies ( and logarithmic associated single vortex energy contributions ) when @xmath178 .",
    "it is precisely for that reason that we have confined our consideration on the mc side to @xmath179 .",
    "it naturally turns out that when @xmath180 , the energy minimization can be trivially ( but meaninglessly , as far as the physical problem is concerned ) be realized by means of one ( or more ) of the @xmath178 and hence @xmath181 .",
    "hence , it is of paramount importance in that regard to amend the `` pathological '' precessional frequency expression with one that more accurately predicts the @xmath182 regime in comparison to the partial differential equation ( pde ) ( see also the relevant partial disparity in fig .",
