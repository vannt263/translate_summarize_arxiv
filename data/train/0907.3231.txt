    "minority game ( mg ) was designed @xcite as a microscopic model of adaptive behaviour observed in multi - agent systems .",
    "the mg is a typical bottom - up construct and therefore usual definitions of the game first specify rules of behaviour for individuals .",
    "then , piecing together microscopic variables , one defines higher - order quantities characterizing grander systems . in some cases , however",
    ", other constructs are also possible , e.g. functions of state like score functions can be attributed to groups of agents without specifying agents individually ( cf .",
    "despite simplicity of basic rules of taking decisions by agents , adaptive abilities and phenomenology of populations playing mgs appear to be surprisingly interesting and their properties are non - trivial @xcite .",
    "special studies were devoted to understanding of such functions like aggregated demand , market volatility , market occupancy etc .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the mg exhibits different modes of behaviour , depending on the game parameters : the random , cooperation and herd .",
    "the latter case is characterized by small strategy space compared to the overall number of agents .",
    "following authors of ref .",
    "@xcite we prefer to call this regime _ efficient _ , because all players have all available information at their disposal .",
    "our study of this regime is motivated by interesting phenomenology observed in numerical simulations and lack of satisfactory interpretations of them .",
    "for example , the aggregated demand exhibits large - amplitude oscillations @xcite and periodicity in time @xcite .",
    "the crowd - anticrowd theory @xcite presents acceptable explanation for oscillations but fails to deal with the periodicity .",
    "this issue was treated by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and , more fruitfully , ref .",
    "the authors of ref .  @xcite introduced the concept of the state of the mg but limit their analysis to the reduced strategy space .    in our previous work @xcite we found , in different context , that the crucial role in explanation of observable behaviour in the mg is played by the utility function . therefore in this paper",
    "we further exploit the utility to study phenomenology of mgs in their efficient regime .",
    "we find that the utility is bounded and the number of states is finite , and prove these facts for the payoff function @xmath0 .",
    "we can represent the game as a markov process and we can substantially reduce the number of states and calculate their probabilities .",
    "then such interesting features of demand like its strong inhomogeneity and presence of patterns in time can be easily interpreted . for other payoff functions , e.g. @xmath1 ,",
    "the number of states can not be reduced and distribution of utility remains irregular .",
    "in this case we can not explicitly calculate probabilities of states .",
    "however , using the same general properties of the utility and representing the game as paths on de  bruijn diagrams , we can also explain strong fluctuations of demand and calculate their frequency .",
    "at each time step @xmath2 , the @xmath3-th agent out of @xmath4 @xmath5 takes an action @xmath6 according to some strategy @xmath7 .",
    "the action @xmath6 takes either of two values : @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "an aggregated demand is defined @xmath10 where @xmath11 refers to the action according to the best strategy , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) below .",
    "such defined @xmath12 is the difference between numbers of agents who choose the @xmath9 and @xmath8 actions .",
    "agents do not know each other s actions but @xmath12 is known to all agents .",
    "the minority action @xmath13 is determined from @xmath12 @xmath14 each agent s memory is limited to @xmath15 most recent winning , i.e. minority , decisions .",
    "each agent has the same number @xmath16 of devices , called strategies , used to predict the next minority action @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18-th strategy of the @xmath3-th agent , @xmath19 @xmath20 , is a function mapping the sequence @xmath21 of the last @xmath15 winning decisions to this agent s action @xmath22 .",
    "since there is @xmath23 possible realizations of @xmath21 , there is @xmath24 possible strategies . at the beginning of the game",
    "each agent randomly draws @xmath25 strategies , according to a given distribution function @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a set consisting of @xmath25 strategies for the @xmath3-th agent .",
    "each strategy @xmath19 , belonging to any of sets @xmath27 , is given a real - valued function @xmath28 which quantifies the utility of the strategy : the more preferable strategy , the higher utility it has .",
    "strategies with higher utilities are more likely chosen by agents .",
    "there are various choice policies . in the popular _ greedy policy",
    "_ each agent selects the strategy of the highest utility @xmath29 if there are two or more strategies with the highest utility then one of them is chosen randomly . the highest - utility strategy ( [ eq13 ] ) used by the agent",
    "is called the _ active strategy _ , in contrast to _ passive strategies _",
    ", unused at given moment .",
    "however , at any time all agents evaluate all their strategies , the active and passive ones .",
    "each strategy @xmath19 is given the _ payoff _ depending on its action @xmath22 @xmath30 , \\label{eq14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is an odd _ payoff function _",
    ", e.g. the steplike @xmath0 @xcite , proportional @xmath1 or scaled proportional @xmath32 .",
    "the learning process corresponds to updating the utility for each strategy @xmath33 such that every agent knows how good its strategies are .",
    "in order to examine mgs in the efficient regime , we performed a series of numerical simulations with different combinations of game parameters , and chosen three most representative cases : @xmath34 , all with the number of strategies per agent @xmath35 .",
    "all three games are in the efficient mode . in the first two cases the condition @xmath36 is fulfilled . in the third one",
    "it is not met and consequences of this fact will become clear later in the text . in all three experiments",
    "the full strategy space is used .",
    "figs [ fig31 ] , [ fig32 ] and [ fig33 ] present results for the steplike payoff function @xmath0 : the time evolution of @xmath12 , the autocorrelation function @xmath37 and the scatter plots of @xmath38 against @xmath12 , respectively .       10 w.b .",
