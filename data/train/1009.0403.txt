    "in @xcite ( hereafter pi ) we have proposed three general models for the potential of the barred - spiral galaxy ngc  1300 , which reflect three different geometries of the system . in the extensive study presented in @xcite ( hereafter pii )",
    "we have found several response models that reproduce at an acceptable degree morphological features of ngc  1300 .",
    "varying the pattern speed in models with all three assumed geometries , we concluded that the main features of ngc  1300 were better reproduced in models clustered around two @xmath0 values , namely 16 and 22  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 .",
    "taking into account the index used for the comparison of the models ( pii ) and the empirical by eye assessment of the resulting morphologies , we sorted out the following four  best \" cases .",

    "the main success of this model is the reproduction of the bar morphology .",
    "* model 2 * : a 2d ( case a in pi ) model , rotating with @xmath0=16  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 .",
    "the main success of this model is the reproduction of the spiral morphology .",
    "* model 3 * : a thick disc model of cylindrical geometry ( case b in pi ) , rotating also with @xmath0=16  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 .",
    "the main success of this model is a nice reproduction of the bar s morphology .",
    "its response at the spiral region succeeds in giving the density maxima of the model roughly at about the same area occupied by the spiral arms of the galaxy .",
    "however , the response at the spiral region of the model forms a spurious ring structure . 4 .",
    "* model 4 * : another thick disc model of cylindrical geometry ( case b in pi ) , rotating this time with @xmath0=22  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 ( as model 1 ) , develops a spiral structure that is worth to be presented as a separate model , since the spiral arms are formed through a different dynamical mechanism than that in model 2 .     to better compare with the orbital models .",
    "isocontours of a smoothed k - band image are overplotted to emphasize the morphological details.,width=302 ]    we will follow the detailed orbital analysis of these four models in the subsequent sections .",
    "nevertheless , we want to underline , that the goal of our paper is to present the dynamical mechanisms behind the observed structures . besides the morphological similarities between response models and ngc  1300 we have chosen the four cases , because they represent different dynamical mechanisms leading to the formation of the bar and the spirals .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to compare different possible dynamics that lead to the support of similar structures in the galactic disc . in that sense",
    "the four models should be considered as typical cases for the description of different dynamics behind them .",
    "a characteristic difference of the model potential from other _ barred - spiral _ models we find in the relevant literature @xcite is its asymmetry . as we can see in the near - infrared image of ngc  1300 ( fig .",
    "3b in pi ) , the two spiral arms have different morphologies .",
    "both arms emerge out of the ends of the bar as a continuation of an ansae structure . however , the ends of the ansae , i.e. the regions where the spiral arms begin , are not at equal distances from the center of the galaxy .",
    "the bar itself is asymmetric with its lower end being closer to the center of the galaxy .",
    "both spiral arms are strong at their beginning , close to the ends of the bar , in the near - infrared , even after correcting for star formation ( pi ) .",
    "notwithstanding , they weaken as we move azimuthally away from the bar . in order to clearly observe the exact shape of the spiral arms we divide in fig .",

    "[ relima ] is conspicuously discontinuous and has a second strong part at the opposite end of the bar than the one it emerges from .",
    "all these asymmetries are taken into account in the potential we use ( pi ) and thus in our orbital calculations .",
    "we study a fully asymmetric dynamical behaviour .",
    "we note that the spiral arms have in the k - band relative sharp features .",
    "this supports a quasi - stable character , since transient features , due to different wave packages , are more likely to be smooth .    in order to facilitate our calculations and the adaption of the potential models to our computer programs",
    ", we have flipped the potential around the central column and then we have rotated it by @xmath3 counterclockwise .",

    "following the framework established in pi , we performed extensive modeling of the stellar component of ngc  1300 in three classes of models reflecting different geometries .",
    "as we have seen in pii , we obtained acceptable solutions for the bar or the spirals not only for more than one pattern speed , but for different geometries as well .",

    "the orbital analysis of the present paper , shed light on the various `` promising '' models and provided feedback , that could be used for the determination of the optimum solution .",
    "however , the most interesting result was not the determination of the optimum parameters for a `` best '' ngc  1300 model , but the dynamical mechanisms themselves , which are leading to the desired morphology",
    ". even models to which our analysis was not pointing to as best matching the ngc  1300 morphology , have a special interest , since their parameters are equally realistic for a barred - spiral system in general as those best applying to the specific galaxy .",
    "summarizing the four models we have chosen to present , we found that there have been two values of @xmath0 for which our models were giving the best matching morphologies to ngc  1300 in the three classes of models we considered , namely @xmath0=16  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 and 22  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 .",
    "the new dynamical mechanisms that we found deserving special attention and extensive presentation , were the following :    * in a 2d model rotating with @xmath0=22  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 , a strong bar with ansae is supported practically _ only by chaotic orbits_. this bar has similar morphology with the bar of ngc  1300 .",
    "decisive role in the support of such a structure by chaotic orbits plays the presence on the effective potential of multiple lagrangian points roughly along the major axis of the bar",
    ". we can understand this by considering an @xmath104 curve , which is not monotonically decreasing , but has a wavy character .",
    "then it is possible to get the same @xmath0 at two ( or more ) points along the @xmath104 curve .",
    "this is the case of the bar in our model 1 .",
    "it is an alternative mechanism for the support of the ansae morphology based only on chaotic orbits .",
    "probably it can be applied to many bars showing this feature . * in a 2d model rotating with @xmath0=16  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 , our model 2 , the morphology of the spiral arms of ngc  1300 can be reproduced by chaotic orbits at e@xmath14 s between the 4/1 resonance and corotation . in our case",
    "the e@xmath14 values of the orbits that support the spirals are well inside corotation .",
    "the spirals are supported by the  bouncing \" of the chaotic orbits on the  walls \" of the effective isopotential drawn with a heavy line in fig .",
    "[ effpot2d16 ] . * in a thick disc model rotating with @xmath0=22  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 , we found a mechanism supporting a spiral structure similar to that of ngc  1300 with orbits around the lagrangian points l@xmath5 and l@xmath6 ( our model 4 ) .",
    "these orbits are either regular orbits trapped around stable periodic orbits at the region , or sticky chaotic orbits , or even chaotic trajectories from a pool of a chaotic sea .",
    "all of them contribute to the support of the spiral arms .",
    "the possibility that a set of banana - like orbits can support a spiral morphology has been indicated by @xcite and @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we do not include in our enumeration of the new mechanisms the formation of a typical ansae bar by regular orbits as in our model 2 .        by `` chaotic orbits '' we actually mean trajectories , that occur after integrating for a given time initial conditions , which we select out of a common chaotic sea , i.e. essentially we examine fragments of a single chaotic orbit .",
    "if at a certain e@xmath14 a percentage of these trajectories supports a given structure ( a bar or a spiral ) it practically means , that the orbit that fills the chaotic sea supports this structure during the same percentage of its , long , integration time .",
    "our result , that surfaces of section without any discernible island of stability provide support to a specific morphological feature , means that the chaotic sea is structured in such a way , that allows this dynamical behaviour . despite the fact",
    ", that there is no obvious structure in a chaotic sea , it is known that the manifolds associated with the unstable periodic orbits existing on the surface of section do structure the chaotic sea ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our models",
    "the spirals that we discuss as reproducing the spiral arms of ngc  1300 are _ inside corotation_.",

    "it is the collective dynamical behaviour in chaotic seas within a specific e@xmath14 range .",
    "the dynamical mechanisms that shape a structure are in general different . in model 2",
    "it is the restriction of the chaotic orbits by a characteristic isocontour of the effective potential and the loops of the orbits as they `` bounce '' on it . on the other hand in model 1",
    "it is the trapping of the orbits in the central area and the presence of the double l@xmath37 points that shape the morphology of the bar .",
    "the structures that are supported by chaotic orbits are dictated to a large extent by the shape of the isocontours of the effective potential .",
    "the fact that star clusters in the spiral arms of ngc  1300 are not well aligned as in other grand - design spiral galaxies ( e.g. ngc  2997 ) @xcite is in agreement with a chaotic character of the orbits of the stars that build them .",
    "it has been proven quite difficult to point to a best ngc  1300 model .",
    "the assumption of different pattern speeds for the bar and the spirals seems less probable , due to the relative locations of the two components .",
    "this is not concluded from the apparent connection of the spiral arms and the bar , but mainly from the fact that we do not find two different , separated zones , where bar and spirals rotate without interacting .",
    "a bar rotating faster than the spirals will reach the spiral arms at a certain fraction of the spiral period and then there will be an interference between the two components .",
    "in such a case the observed morphology would be just a snapshot in a transient morphology of the barred - spiral system .",
    "an indication against the transient spiral hypothesis is that the spiral arms exist in k - band and they are even sharp features as we mentioned in the introduction . if we have to deal with a more or less stationary morphology , the regions where bar and spirals rotate should be rather separated . as an example we mention the ngc  3359 model by @xcite , where in a two pattern speeds model the orbits of the spiral component change their topology in such a way as to allow the bar to rotate within a certain radius leaving the spirals outside it ( their fig .",

    "<S> we present the orbital analysis of four response models , that succeed in reproducing morphological features of ngc  1300 . </S>",
    "<S> two of them assume a planar ( 2d ) geometry with @xmath0=22 and 16  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the two others assume a cylindrical ( thick ) disc and rotate with the same pattern speeds as the 2d models . </S>",
    "<S> these response models reproduce most successfully main morphological features of ngc  1300 among a large number of models , as became evident in a previous study . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is the discovery of three new dynamical mechanisms that can support structures in a barred - spiral grand design system . </S>",
    "<S> these mechanisms are presented in characteristic cases , where these dynamical phenomena take place . </S>",
    "<S> they refer firstly to the support of a strong bar , of ansae type , almost solely by chaotic orbits , then to the support of spirals by chaotic orbits that for a certain number of pattern revolutions follow an n:1 ( n=7,8 ) morphology , and finally to the support of spiral arms by a combination of orbits trapped around l@xmath2 and sticky chaotic orbits with the same jacobi constant . </S>",
    "<S> we have encountered these dynamical phenomena in a large fraction of the cases we studied as we varied the parameters of our general models , without forcing in some way their appearance . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that they could be responsible for the observed morphologies of many barred - spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> comparing our response models among themselves we find that the ngc  1300 morphology is best described by a thick disc model for the bar region and a 2d disc model for the spirals , with both components rotating with the same pattern speed @xmath0=16  km  s@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the whole structure is included inside the corotation of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the bar is supported mainly by regular orbits , while the spirals are supported by chaotic orbits .    </S>",
