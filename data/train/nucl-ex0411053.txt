    "about 40 years ago hagedorn @xcite realized that the then growing evidence for an exponentially increasing mass spectrum of hadronic resonance states would lead to divergencies in the energy density ( and other thermodynamic quantities ) at the ( hagedorn ) temperature t@xmath0 m@xmath1 .",
    "a few years later , after the discovery of asymptotic freedom in qcd @xcite it was realized by collins and perry @xcite and independently by cabibbo and parisi @xcite that a hadronic system at sufficiently high density or temperature should convert into a new state of matter , commonly called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , at a critical temperature t@xmath2 .",
    "in fact , the first phase diagram of nuclear / hadronic matter appears in @xcite .",
    "although t@xmath2 and t@xmath3 were not immediately related at the time , it is now clear that both developments provided the starting point for this growing field of research .",
    "about 8 years later baym @xcite drew up the phase diagram with many of the features discussed presently .",
    "the physics of the transition from hadronic matter to qgp is now much better understood , at least for vanishing net baryon density : solving qcd on a discrete lattice has led to the results summarized in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] . near a critical temperature of t@xmath2 = 175 @xmath4",
    "mev the energy density ( and other thermodynamic quantities ) exhibit a strong increase , signalling the transition to a deconfined state consisting of quarks and gluons .",
    "the critical energy density @xmath5 ) is 700 @xmath6 200 mev/@xmath7 , about 5 times the energy density in a large nucleus ; whether the transition is a true phase transition in the thermodynamic sense or rather a rapid cross - over is currently much discussed but for most of the experimental observables discussed below not relevant .",
    "a vigorous experimental program has been mounted over the past 20 years , first at the bnl - ags and cern sps accelerators and since the year 2000 at rhic , to collide atomic nuclei at ultra - relativistic energies with the aim to produce the qgp and to study its properties .",
    "an impressive database has been assembled in the center of mass energy range 4 @xmath8 200 gev .",
    "the current review is not meant to be comprehensive , but rather focusses on collective behavior of the matter produced , on its opacity to fast quarks , and on our current knowledge of the phase boundary between qgp and hadronic matter .",
    "much more information on the experimental database as well as on various theoretical descriptions can be found in the proceedings of recent quark matter conferences @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ dndy ] we show the current information on the energy dependence of charged particle and transverse energy production near midrapidity in central pbpb ( auau ) collisions .",
    "overall there is good agreement between experiments .",
    "a noteworthy result of these studies is the apparent power - law increase in both quantities , close to what landau @xcite predicted in 1952 in his hydrodynamic approach .",
    "extrapolation of this trend towards higher energies would lead to a charged particle multiplicity of about 2000 at midrapidity in pbpb collisions at lhc energy .    contrasting these smooth energy dependences are recent observations by the cern na49 collaboration of a rather narrow structure in the k@xmath9 ratio near @xmath10 gev @xcite .",
    "these results look rather striking , but would need to be confirmed by another experiment before further - reaching conclusions can be drawn .        turning to more detailed information on hadron production",
    "we note that hadron yields observed in central nuclear collisions at ags , sps , and rhic energies are found to be described with high precision within a hadro - chemical equilibrium approach @xcite , governed by a chemical freeze - out temperature t@xmath11 , baryo - chemical potential @xmath12 and the fireball volume v@xmath11",
    ". a recent review can be found in @xcite .",
    "importantly , the data at sps and rhic energy comprise multi - strange hadrons including the @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "their yields agree very well with the chemical equilibrium calculation and are strongly enhanced as compared to observations in pp collisions .",
    "we show as an example the results for rhic energy in fig .",
    "[ yields ] .",
    "the chemical parameters t@xmath11 and @xmath12 determined from fits to data at all available energies are plotted in the phase diagram of hadronic matter shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "the phase transition lines in this figure are taken from recent analyses within the framework of lattice qcd @xcite and include the most recent estimate for the tri - critical point .",
    "also included in this figure is a line of constant energy density , computed within the framework of the hadronic gas model of @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this line of constant energy density is , at @xmath15 mev , much closer to the chemical freeze - out points than to the phase lines from lattice qcd .",
    "this raises the question whether a critical energy density significantly exceeding 1 gev/@xmath7 as one would extract at critical points such as t@xmath16 mev at @xmath17 mev makes sense ( see fig .  [ phase ] ) .",
    "an important observation about the phase diagram is that , for top sps energy and above , the chemical parameters determined from the measured hadron yields coincide within the uncertainties of about @xmath18 mev with the phase boundary as determined from lattice qcd calculations .",
    "a natural question arises : is this coincidence accidental and , if not , what enforces equilibration at the phase boundary ? considerations about collisional rates and timescales of the hadronic fireball expansion @xcite imply that at sps and rhic the equilibrium can not be established in the hadronic medium and that is is the phase transition which drives the particles densities and ensures chemical equilibrium .    in @xcite it is further shown that many body collisions near t@xmath2 provide a mechanism for the equilibration . because of the rapid density change near a phase transition such multi - particle collisions provide a natural explanation for the observation of chemical equilibration at rhic energies and lead to t@xmath11=t@xmath2 to within an accuracy of a few mev .",
    "any scenario with t@xmath11 substantially smaller than t@xmath2 would require that either multi - particle interactions dominate even much below t@xmath2 or that the two - particle cross sections are larger than in the vacuum by a high factor . both of the latter hypothesis seem unlikely in view of the rapid density decrease .",
    "the critical temperature determined from rhic for t@xmath19 coincides well with lattice estimates @xcite for @xmath20 , as discussed above .",
    "the same arguments as discussed here for rhic energy also hold for sps energies : it is likely that also there the phase transition drives the particle densities and insures chemical equilibration .",
    "it was alternatively proposed @xcite that the observed hadron abundances arise from a direct production of strange ( and non - strange ) particles by hadronization .",
    "how this happens microscopically is unclear . to escape the above argument that t@xmath11=t@xmath2 one would have to argue that no hadronic picture for this process exists at all - this is unlikely since the abundances are determined by hadronic properties ( masses ) with high precision",
    "second , one may question if the `` chemical temperature '' extracted from the abundances is a universal temperature which also governs the local kinetic aspects and can be associated with the critical temperature of a phase transition in equilibrium .",
    "indeed , in a prethermalization process , different equilibrium properties are realized at different time scales .",
    "nevertheless , all experience shows that kinetic equilibration occurs before chemical equilibration .",
    "it seems hard to imagine that chemical equilibrium abundances are realized at a time when the kinematic distributions are not yet close to their equilibrium values .",
    "furthermore , the recently observed centrality dependence of multi - strange baryon production at rhic @xcite supports the picture of equilibration near t@xmath2 in the hadronic phase : the yields of hyperons reach the equilibrium value only for rather central collisions ( n@xmath21 ) , underlining the importance of density in the equilibration process .",
    "thermal models have also been successfully used @xcite to describe hadron production in e@xmath22e@xmath23 and hadron - hadron collisions , leading to temperature parameters close to 170 mev . indeed",
    ", this suggests that hadronization itself can be seen as a prethermalization process .",
    "however , to account for the strangeness undersaturation in such collisions , multi - strange baryons can only be reproduced by introducing a strangeness suppression factor of about 0.5 , leading to a factor of 8 suppression of @xmath13 baryons . in the hadronic picture",
    "this is due to the  absence  of sufficient multi - particle scattering since the system is not in a high density phase due to a phase transition .",
    "we further note , as is evident from fig .",
    "[ phase ] that , in heavy ion collisions , the chemical temperature is * not * universal , but rather strongly varies ( at least at large @xmath12-values ) with the chemical potential , implying the existence of a medium in distinction to the situation in elementary particle collisions .",
    "during the year 2000 the ceres experiment took a large data sample of low mass ( @xmath24 1.4 gev ) with an apparatus improved by the addition of a radial tpc , for 158 a gev pb+au collisions @xcite .",
    "approximately 3@xmath25 central events were recorded with a mass resolution of @xmath26 .",
    "first results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ceres ] . for the first time ,",
    "structure due to the @xmath27 and @xmath28 resonances are visible .",
    "the data , normalized to the @xmath29 dalitz decay peak of the hadronic decay cocktail , are compared to various theoretical predictions .",
    "adding pion annihilation to the hadronic decay cocktail ( dashed line ) yields a reasonable description of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 mass region but the continuum in the mass range @xmath30 mev is significantly underestimated .",
    "modifying the @xmath31 propagator in the medium of the fireball according to the scaling proposal of brown and rho @xcite ( dot - dashed line ) or via @xmath31-baryon interactions @xcite ( solid line ) leads to much better agreement with the data , strongly disfavoring a scenario in which the @xmath31 meson is not modified in the hot and dense medium .",
    "we observe that , near the @xmath27 region , the data are better described in the scenario of @xcite but a stronger statement has to await the final data analysis .",
    "the @xmath28 meson production yield determined from these data is consistent with that predicted in the thermal model of @xcite , but disagrees at the 2 sigma level with the yield determined by the na49 experiment in the kk channel @xcite .",
    "preliminary results from @xmath32kk by ceres @xcite indicate good agreement between the hadronic measurements where the coverage of the experiments overlap .",
    "one of the major results from all 4 rhic experiments is the observation , at p@xmath33 values larger than 2 gev , of a strong suppression of charged particle production in central nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collisions compared to pp collisions .",
    "commonly this is expressed in the ratio r@xmath34 , i.e. the ratio of the spectra scaled by the number of binary collisions . in the low p@xmath33 region where participant scaling applies ,",
    "r@xmath35 for central pbpb collisions . in the hard scattering region ,",
    "i.e.in the p@xmath33 region above a few gev",
    "this ratio should approach 1 if a nuclear collision is merely a superposition of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions . in contradistinction to this expectation , r@xmath36 for central auau collisions never exceeds 0.7 , and quite dramatically drops to a value near 0.2 for p@xmath37 6 gev and levels off there .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ raa1 ] , where the impressive consistency between the data from all 4 rhic experiments is also apparent .",
    "no or little deviation from binary scaling is observed @xcite in d au collisions , demonstrating that the suppression is due to the medium produced in aa collisions and not an initial state effect .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of this dramatic effect is that the parton preceding the high p@xmath33 hadron observed in the measurements scatters and loses energy in the medium produced in the aa collision .",
    "the degree of opacity of the medium can be evaluated more quantitatively : for a completely black medium one would expect only surface emission of hadrons in the relevant p@xmath33 range of 3 - 10 gev .",
    "this implies n@xmath38 scaling , leading to a lower limit of @xmath39 for central auau collisions , i.e. a factor of 4 lower than observed at rhic",
    ". it will be interesting to find out whether this surface emission limit will be reached at lhc energies .     of charged particle yields in central aa and pp collisions .",
    "for details see text.,width=585 ]    recent measurements by the brahms collaboration @xcite for dau collisions show that r@xmath40 decreases to values significantly smaller than 1 with increasing hadron rapidity .",
    "this has been interpreted @xcite as evidence for non - linear effects expected within the framework of the color - glass condensate ( cgc ) .",
    "however , recent analysis @xcite shows that even in the brahms experiment only rather moderate parton momentum fractions x@xmath41 contribute significantly to the cross section .",
    "further work needs to be done to substantiate the cgc interpretation .",
    "it is important to realize that the overall suppression visible in fig .",
    "[ raa1 ] for charged hadrons depends in detail significantly on the type of hadron under consideration .",
    "in particular , all mesons seem to follow a similar suppression pattern while the baryon / meson ratio increases strongly with transverse momentum , reaching a value close to 1 for the p/@xmath42 ratio , e.g. , near p@xmath43 gev @xcite .",
    "this behavior is quite inconsistent with the standard fragmentation picture of a hadronizing parton , from which much smaller p/@xmath42 ratios are expected .",
    "based on these and other data on elliptic flow of mesons and baryons in the transverse momentum region @xmath44 gev an alternative picture was developed recently @xcite in which hadron production occurs by recombination rather than fragmentation of partons .",
    "in fact , if the parton density is high enough , there is , for an exponentially decreasing parton p@xmath33 spectrum , a critical parton transverse momentum below which `` naive '' and @xmath45 will recombine to form a hadron at @xmath46 . note , however , that this process violates entropy conservation . ] recombination will win over fragmentation .",
    "first calculations within this framework indicate that the enhanced baryon emission as well as the hadron species dependence of the elliptic flow pattern can be quite well accounted for . how to reconcile this picture which is based on an expanding parton phase with the observed jet - like correlations in the data seems not straightforward ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite )",
    ".    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     using this result one may estimate the initial energy density at time @xmath47 to be @xmath48 gev/@xmath7 .",
    "clearly this estimate exceeds by 2 orders of magnitude the energy density inside a heavy nucleus and is more than a factor 30 above the critical energy density for the transition from hadronic matter to the qgp .",
    "the jet quenching data thus lend strong support to the interpretation that a quasi - equilibrated partonic state is formed at early times in central ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "in this brief survey we have presented strong evidence for the formation of partonic matter near equilibrium from data on hadron production at low and intermediate transverse momenta in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions . in particular , the observation that the data on hadron production ratios are in very good agreement with chemical equilibrium predictions has been used to provide a first determination of the critical temperature of the qcd phase transition .",
    "the striking data on jet quenching demonstrate the opacity of the new state of matter , and provide a glimpse into the very hot early phase of the partonic fireball .",
    "first and tantalizing data on heavy quark and quarkonia production have already been obtained at rhic and high precision data in this area are eagerly awaited . also the sps program on heavy quarks",
    "will be revived with new results from the na60 experiment , which will furthermore provide high resolution , high statistics pa and inin data on low - mass dilepton production .",
    "with lhc coming on - line in 2007 quark matter studies will continue on much hotter and longer - lived fireballs formed at @xmath49 tev . for a survey of the planned physics program see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "matter at the highest baryon density will be studied with precision experiments at the planned fair facility at gsi . for a survey of the planned physics program",
