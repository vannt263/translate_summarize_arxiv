    "it is believed that galaxies form in dark matter halos , which grow through gravitational instability from the density fluctuations seeded in the early universe .",
    "the baryonic matter is then accreted into the dark matter halos and cools radiatively to assemble galaxies .",
    "although the structure and the evolution of dark matter halos are fairly well understood with the use of analytic modeling @xcite and @xmath1-body simulations @xcite , galaxy formation still remains a challenging problem as it is a complex process involving simultaneous actions of many physical mechanisms .",
    "one of the long - standing problems in galaxy formation is that , in the absence of heating sources , the majority of baryonic matter in the universe is predicted to have cooled into dark matter halos by the present time ( e.g. @xcite ) , while in reality only a small fraction of the baryonic matter associated with galaxies is observed in the cold ( stars plus cold gas ) phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "this `` over - cooling '' problem implies that feedback must have played a very important role in shaping galaxies .",
    "energetically , the ongoing galactic feedback appears to be sufficient to balance the cooling .",
    "indeed , much of the expected mechanical energy from supernovae ( sne ) feedback is `` missing '' at least from x - ray observations @xcite . in general",
    ", the observed x - ray emission consists of several components : 1 ) relatively bright x - ray binaries with neutron star and black hole companions ( @xmath2 ) , which may be detected individually in nearby galaxies ; 2 ) numerous cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and coronally active binaries ( abs ) ( @xmath3 ) , which are too faint to be detected individually , but can be constrained based on near - ir emission @xcite ; 3 ) diffuse hot gas heated chiefly by type ia sne .",
    "the typical observed diffuse x - ray emission only accounts for a few percent of the expected sn energy input ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the majority of which is undetected .",
    "naturally , one would expect that the missing energy in such galaxies is gone with a galactic outflow , which could have a profound impact on the halo gas and the accretion of the igm .",
    "of course , this impact should evolve with time and depend on the formation process of the galaxy .",
    "for example , if a bulge forms primarily in a starburst ( sb ) , it can induce an initial blastwave propagating into the surrounding medium .",
    "the heated circum - galactic medium ( cgm ) can then affect the impact of the later feedback from stellar mass loss and type ia supernovae ( sne ) as well as from star formation and agn .",
    "therefore , one needs to study the interplay of the stellar feedback and the gas accretion of the galaxies to understand their evolution .",
    "existing studies have shown the importance of the stellar feedback , though they are limited by the over - simplified treatments or are for some specific targets .",
    "on the one hand , existing models for galactic bulge outflows / winds include little consideration for the evolving gravitational potential and gaseous circum - galactic environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , in simulations of large - scale structure formation",
    ", the treatment of the stellar feedback is limited by the spatial resolution . a more sophisticated model that incorporates the stellar feedback in an evolving galaxy has been investigated by @xcite with 1-d hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "they found that the core - collapse sne in an initial sb can substantially affect the gas dynamics beyond 1mpc .",
    "but the work was done specifically to explain the hot gas properties of the luminous elliptical galaxy ngc 4472 . in this high - mass galaxy ,",
    "later feedback is found to be unimportant , partly because the authors adopted a low sn rate ( 0.03 snu ; one snu unit denotes one sn per @xmath4 per century ) . in this case , the gas dynamics is dominated by a cooling flow .    in the present paper , we introduce a stellar feedback model in which the feedback is closely associated with the formation history of the galactic bulges . in this scenario ,",
    "we divide the evolution of a bulge into three stages : 1 ) . at high redshifts , as the host dark matter halo assembles , the central galaxy builds up a bulge through frequent major mergers .",
    "2 ) . as a consequence of the violent mergers , a sb in the bulge is triggered .",
    "the intensive starburst powers a blastwave to heat and rarefy the cgm .",
    "3 ) . at low redshift ,",
    "the galaxy is in a quiescent phase as its host halo accretes mass gently .",
    "however , as the low - mass bulge stars die off from the main sequence , type ia sne provide a long - lasting energy input to the cgm and this gradual feedback maintains a hot gaseous halo .",
    "this scenario naturally connects the stellar feedback and the general formation history of a galaxy .",
    "we find that such a feedback can profoundly affect the evolution of the model galaxies .",
    "in particular , the overcooling and missing - energy problems can be naturally explained .",
    "here we demonstrate the effects of the feedback based on a 1-d model of galaxies , although limited 2- and 3-d simulations have also been carried out to check multi - dimensional effects .",
    "our aim here is to capture qualitatively the feedback effects on the structure , physical state , and dynamics of the hot gas around bulge - dominated galaxies on scales greater than galactic bulges / disks .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first describe the main physical ingredients of our model and numerical methods (  2 ) .",
    "we then present the results of a reference galaxy model and its variations (  3 ) . in  4 ,",
    "we discuss how the results provide a potential solution to the overcooling and missing energy problems , as well as the caveats of the present model .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in  5 .",
    "we set up hydrodynamical simulation models to investigate the effects of the feedback from a galactic stellar bulge on galaxy formation .",
    "we focus our study on the early - type spirals and the typical low@xmath5@xmath0 elliptical galaxies in fields or in small groups ( such as the mw and m31 ) .",
    "our fidicuial galaxy has an intermediate / massive galactic bulge and a dark matter halo with mass @xmath6 at the present time . in the following ,",
    "we first describe how such a galaxy assembles mass , and then introduce the recipe to model the stellar bulge formation and its feedback .",
    "finally we describe the numerical codes and methods . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath7cdm cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10km / s / mpc .",
    "we assume the universal cosmic baryon fraction to be @xmath11 .",
    "it has been shown by high resolution @xmath1-body simulations that within the virial radius @xmath12 the density profile of a collapsed dark matter halo can be well described by the nfw profile @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a characteristic radius and @xmath15 a characteristic density of the halo that is related to the collapse time of the halo .",
    "the shape of such a profile is usually characterized by the concentration parameter , defined as @xmath16 . since a virialized halo",
    "is defined as a spherical region with a mean density that is @xmath17 times the mean density of the universe , the characteristic density can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "for the cosmology we adopted here , @xmath20 at @xmath21 @xcite . for a given cosmology , a virial mass , and a given time , the density profile of a dark matter halo is determined by the single parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "simulations have demonstrated that dark matter halos assemble their mass through an early fast accretion phase followed by a slow one @xcite .",
    "this two - phase assembly history can be fairly well described by an exponential function @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the halo mass at the present time , @xmath25 is the expansion scale factor [ i.e. , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the redshift ] , and @xmath28 is the scale factor at the halo `` formation time '' that separates the two accretion phases .",
    "both @xmath1-body simulations @xcite and analytical model @xcite have shown that the halo concentration parameter is closely related to the formation time @xmath28 . for a halo that is still in its fast accretion regime , @xmath29 ; for a halo identified at @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "we make use of the 1-d simulation code developed by @xcite to reproduce the mass distribution of a growing dark halo embedded in the cosmic density field .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we setup the initial perturbation at @xmath32 .",
    "the perturbation profile is set up in such a way that the subsequent accretion history of the halo follows exactly the average mass accretion history given by eq.([eq : mah ] ) .",
    "the halo s virial mass is @xmath33 at the present time . to be consistent with the statistical properties of dark halos in cosmological simulations , we choose the formation time @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting halo has a concentration of about 13 , which is typical for halos of such a mass .",
    "the advantage of adopting this approach is that , at any redshift , the density profiles both within and outside the current virial radius are modeled realistically .",
    "[ fig : dmprofile ] shows the density profiles of the simulated halo at four different redshifts .",

    "additional feedback may arise from the galactic disk , if present ( although cool gas there may consume much of the input energy ) , and from agns .",
    "we do not deal with these complications here , which may be incorporated into the above two phases approximately within the uncertainties in our adopted feedback parameters .",
    "the key parameters are the initial sb energy feedback @xmath56 and the evolution of the type ia sn rate and mass loss rate .",

    "we have chosen a set of models to illustrate how the dynamics and observational properties of the hot gas depend on the sb energy output efficiency ( @xmath67 ) , the gradual stellar feedback evolution , and the treatment of cold gas .",

    "in this section , we first focus on the fiducial model and then check the variance due to the changes in the model parameters",
    ". we further give the immediate predictions of our model on the halo gas fraction and x - ray brightness .",
    "[ fig : mwb4a ] illustrates the gas properties of the reference model galaxy at three representative redshifts .",
    "soon after the sb ( e.g. , @xmath27=1.4 ; dot - dashed line ) , a blastwave ( corresponding to the jump at @xmath91 kpc in all the four panels ) is driven into the accretion flow of the galaxy .",
    "this accretion flow is most apparent in the radial velocity panel ( i.e. , the negative velocity just in front of the blastwave ) . at larger radii",
    ", the gas is still trailing the hubble expansion .",
    "later , the blastwave , though weakening , catches up the trailing gas ( i.e. , no negative velocity at @xmath92 and 0.0 ) .",
    "the blastwave heats the gas to a temperature of @xmath93 k , over a region extending well beyond the virial radius at @xmath94 ( @xmath95 kpc ) and even at @xmath96 ( @xmath97 kpc ) .",
    "consequently , _ after this pre - heating by the sb - induced blastwave , no virial shock forms .",
    "_    the sb heating also allows for the transportation of the later stellar feedback away from the galactic bulge . without the sb heating and the resultant rarefaction of the surrounding gas , the energy from the type ia sne",
    "would be radiated away around the bulge and the gradual feedback could never launch a galactic bulge wind . with the low density of the ambient gas due to the expansion",
    ", the gradual stellar feedback develops into a galactic bulge wind , at least in early time when the sn rate is high .",
    "this wind reaches a velocity up to @xmath98 at @xmath99 and @xmath100 at @xmath101 as the rate decreases .",

    "the reverse - shock first moves outward and then starts to move back toward the center as the type ia sn rate declines with time .",
    "the reverse - shocked wind material has a temperature of @xmath102 k. this temperature is determined by the specific energy of the feedback , minus the galaxy s gravitational potential that the wind needs to climb through .",
    "the radiative cooling of the wind is negligible ( see table 2 and later discussion in  4.2 ) .",
    "therefore , the sb heating enables the impact of the type ia sn - driven feedback over global scales around the galaxy .    in return",
    ", the long - lasting type ia sn - driven feedback helps to maintain and even to enhance the low - density hot environment produced by the sb .",
    "first , the inauguration of the type ia sn - driven feedback about 0.1 gyr after the sb generates a forward shock , which can be seen in figure  [ fig : mwb4a ] ( bottom panel ) as a small velocity jump just behind the sb blastwave .",
    "this shock propagates fast in the sb - heated gas with little radiative energy loss @xcite and quickly overtakes the sb blastwave .",
    "secondly , the type ia sn - driven stellar feedback prevents the sb - heated gas from falling back toward the galactic center to form a cooling flow , which would generate too large an x - ray luminosity to be consistent with observations .",

    "though initially the blastwave is weaker and the outermost shock front has a smaller galactocentric radius , this model maintains a much stronger bulge wind at @xmath21 because it has a higher type ia rate at the present time .",
    "the effect of the collapsed dense shell on the hot gas flow depends on the coupling of the cooled and hot gases .",
    "while the physical processes will be studied in our 2-d modeling ( tang & wang 2008 , in preparation ) , here we examine the effect in an extreme case by adding a simple `` dropout '' recipe in our simulation to decouple the cooled gas from the hot gas flow .",
    "when a gas pixel cools below the minimum temperature allowed , we dropout 99% of its mass and increase its temperature accordingly to keep the pressure unchanged . using this recipe ,",
    "the dropout does not generate numerical perturbation into the simulation and conserves the energy in the flow .",
    "simulations with or without the dropout can thus be used to demonstrate the full range of possible dynamic effect .",
    "the dropout in general has little effect on the gas dynamics , if the cooled gas shell is located at a large radius .",
    "this is the case for the reference model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmpdo ] ) . with the dropout ,",
    "the flow just becomes a little `` lighter '' .",
    "but because the gravitational potential is shallow at the large radius , the effect is small .    on the other hand , if the cold dense shell gets close to or actually falls toward the center , the effect on the gas flow can be substantial .",
    "the shell imposes a weight that the enclosed hot gas needs to hold , which can result in increased radiative cooling and eventually quench the bulge outflow . as mentioned previously , for models with a reduced @xmath71 or @xmath67 the dense shell moves back to the center and forms an artificially cold core before @xmath21 .",
    "when this weight is removed through the dropout , the bulge outflow becomes faster and the radiative cooling becomes slower .",
    "the gas evolution of the model ve with the `` dropout '' enabled is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stado ] . in this model ,",
    "the stellar ejecta is confined in a region less than 100kpc , the initial inner bulge wind is quickly quenched and turns into a subsonic outflow .",
    "the outflow is stagnated around half of the virial radius ( i.e. , stagnation is defined as the outflow velocity becomes zero ) , and an accretion flow is built up near the virial radius . thus a density enhanced region is formed between half of the virial radius and the virial shock .",
    "effective cooling first occurs in sb - enriched material because it has a relatively high density and low temperature ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : mwb4a ] ) .",
    "most of the dropout occurs at radius larger than 100kpc in this simulation . by dropping out the cooler gas",
    ", the galactic flow can stay in a quasi - static state for quite a long time , i.e. , as for the specific case ( model ve ) the density and temperature profiles are hardly changed for half of the hubble time .",
    "the outermost shock front ( actually powered by sne ia which overtakes the blastwave of sb ) is still riding on the turnaround hubble flow at @xmath21 .",
    "note that a global galactic wind would still be maintained by the gradual stellar feedback if it were started from a _ gas free _ initial condition ( fig .  [ fig : stado ] ) .      the stellar feedback results in a baryonic mass deficit within the virial radius .",
    "the radial variation of the local baryonic fraction ( the baryon to total gravitational mass at each galactocentric radius ) of the reference model is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mf ] , and the corresponding accumulative baryonic fraction ( the total baryonic mass to the total gravitational mass within that radius ) is shown in the middle panel .",
    "the dash - dot blue line denotes the radial variation at the starburst time @xmath43 .",
    "the variation of the local baryonic fraction at this time follows the fluctuation of the simulated dark matter profile given by the 1-d lagrangian code ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dmprofile ] ) .",
    "the cumulative fraction shows that the baryonic mass fraction decreases nearly monotonically and reaches the universal value around the virial radius . at @xmath27=0 ,",
    "the baryon fraction drops down to about 5% near the virial radius and reaches the minimum value at the contact - discontinuity between the materials from the two feedback phases .",
    "the baryon fraction then increases outward and finally reaches the universal fraction at the forward blastwave ( located at a distance about 6 times the virial radius ) .",
    "this increase is largely due to the sb - enriched material and the cgm swept up to a large radius by the galactic wind . within the virial radius ,",
    "the hot gas contribution is negligible , as shown by the dash red line ( the inner part has been scaled up by a factor of @xmath112 in the plot for easy visualization ) .    the amount of baryonic mass within the virial radius depends on feedback parameters , such as the strength of the sb and the gradual stellar feedback evolution .",
    "the cumulative baryonic mass fraction of model va , for example , is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : mf ] . with the reduced sb efficiency ,",
    "the baryonic mass fraction at @xmath21 is higher around the virial radius than that of the reference model . in table 2",
    "we list the baryonic mass fractions for all the models within one and two virial radii , respectively . for models with strong sb feedback ( i.e. , models ref . , vc , and vd ) ,",
    "the baryonic fractions within one virial radius are about 5% , and the fractions are even lower within two virial radius , which demonstrates that a large fraction of the baryonic mass is expelled out to a region beyond two virial radius . in model",
    "ve the baryonic fraction is slightly less than the universal value because of its reduced stellar feedbacks .",
    "the x - ray luminosities are listed in table 2 for all the models .",
    "the luminosities within 2kpc characterize the diffuse x - ray emission from the inner bulge wind .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the reference model in the inner region is @xmath113 , and in model ve the x - ray luminosity is @xmath114 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities within the virial radius vary dramatically with respect to different models . in the reference model",
    "it is only @xmath115 , whereas in model ve the luminosity is as high as @xmath116 .",
    "we now discuss the implications of the above results in connection to the issues mentioned in  1 and the additional work that is needed to further the study of the feedback scenario proposed here .      except in model ve ,",
    "the baryonic mass fractions are only about 5% within virial radius , consistent with an inferred low baryonic fraction in the milky way ( roughly about 6% , e.g. , @xcite ) . in our reference model , the radiative cooling after the sb is small because of the low density and high temperature of the halo gas . here",
    "the feedback is treated self - consistently for both the internal heating of the intrahalo gas ( within a galaxy s virial radius ) and the external `` pre - heating '' of the surrounding igm .",
    "the rarefaction of the pre - heated igm substantially reduces and even reverses the accretion .",
    "the degree of the rarification can be characterized by the baryonic deficit around a galaxy ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : mf ] ) .",
    "the amount of cooling by the gaseous halo at present can , in principle , allow for placing constraints on @xmath67 .",
    "for a too small @xmath67 , the gas would not be sufficiently pre - heated to reduce the accretion into the halo , and the baryonic mass fraction would be much closer to the cosmic universal value , as shown in model ve .",
    "the total cooling rate of the gas around the reference galaxy is only a few of @xmath117 , the bulk of which arises from the accumulated reverse - shocked bulge wind material , located outside of the virial radius ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lxsb ] left panel ) . for the model with a lower @xmath67 value",
    ", the cooling would be more efficient and occurs in regions closer to the bulge . in general",
    ", no over - cooling problem occurs in our model of galaxy evolution with the proper stellar feedback included .",
    "probably the most thorough study of hot gas outflows around ellipticals is by @xcite .",
    "their 1-d model galaxies evolve through up to three consecutive evolutionary states : an initial wind , a transition to subsonic outflow , and a finial inflow phase .",
    "x - ray faint ellipticals are suggested to be in their wind phase , and brightest ellipticals should mostly be in the inflow regime .",
    "the subsonic outflow is shown to be unstable and short - lived .",
    "our simulations have shown that the sb feedback is able to produce a low - density environment near the galactic bulge , which is similar to the `` gas - free '' condition assumed in @xcite .",
    "but we note that the stellar bulge feedback material does not leave the galaxy freely .",
    "much of the feedback energy may be thermalized well inside the virial radius , forming a hot gaseous halo .",
    "the bulge wind solution applies only within the reverse shock front , shown by dot - dashed blue lines in figure  [ fig : mwb4cmp ] , for example .",
    "when the reverse shock moves inward , the wind becomes less and less developed and may eventually turn into a global subsonic outflow .",
    "we find that this subsonic outflow is stable , in contrast to the result of @xcite . the unstable and short life of the subsonic outflow in their model is apparently caused by the use of the `` outflow '' outer boundary condition , which is generally not consistent with the changing properties of the galaxy and its environment .",
    "the `` outflow '' boundary condition has no effect on the internal flow , as long as the outflow is supersonic .",
    "but if subsonic , however , the outflow tends to be suppressed by the artificial force inserted by the leveled off pressure at the boundary .",
    "the same force would amplify an inflow and quickly quench the inner bulge wind / outflow . in our model , no boundary condition needs to be assumed for the bulge wind / outflow , because it occurs well inside the spatial range of the simulations .",
    "the stability of the subsonic outflow state has strong implications for understanding the large scattering in @xmath0 ratios of galactic bulges .",
    "the distribution of the hot gas in the state depends not only on the feedback in the bulge , but also on the condition in outer regions of the galactic halo , which is a manifestation of the large - scale environment and formation history of a galaxy .",
    "this dependence can create a large diversity in the x - ray luminosities of such galaxies .      for the bulge outflow to be the solution of the missing feedback problem , a sufficient mechanical energy output from both the sb and type ia sne is needed .",
    "a weak sb ( e.g. , a too small @xmath67 value ) would not create an environment with a low enough density for a lasting galactic bulge outflow .",
    "even with a large sb feedback , a too low sne ia rate would lead to the blowout gas being re - accreted into the halo .",
    "once an inflow is developed near the bulge , the feedback from sne ia would be consumed locally , producing a luminosity comparable to the input , which is disfavored by current observations .    while our 1-d model may provide a reasonably good characterization of the large - scale impact of the stellar bulge feedback , the bulge wind / outflow is inefficient in producing diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "in particular , we find that the x - ray luminosity from the 1-d wind / outflow is considerably lower than what is observed from galactic bulges .",
    "observationally the reported `` diffuse '' x - ray emission of our galactic bulge and the one in m31 are about @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "for all the models , the x - ray emission from the inner region is no more than a few of @xmath119 .",
    "although @xmath120 of the energy is radiated within half of the virial radius in model ve , its x - ray emission near the bulge region is only a few times @xmath121 .",
    "note that in model ve about 40% of the total energy input is used to remove the stellar mass ejecta out of the gravitational well at @xmath21 and a less fraction is required at early time .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the diffuse x - ray surface brightness of a bulge wind is generally steeper than that of stellar mass / light as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lxsb ] right panel ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "only model ve , in which the gas flow is now in a subsonic outflow state , has a flatter surface brightness , consistent with observations of x - ray - faint early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray faintness of the bulge wind could be caused by our over - simplified 1-d model",
    ". a careful analysis of the x - ray emission from the m31 bulge indicates the presence of a truly diffuse component with a 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity of @xmath122 ( li & wang 2007 ) .",
    "however , this component has a substantially lower temperature ( @xmath123kev ) and a bipolar morphology in and around the bulge .",
    "these facts indicate that much of this soft x - ray component arises from the interaction of hot gas with cool gas and that the 1-d approximation is too simplistic , at least in the immediate vicinity of the bulge region , which may be expected because of the presence of cool gas in the galactic disk .",
    "a detailed study shows that this interaction may indeed be important , especially for the calculation of x - ray emission , which is sensitive to presence of density structures .",
    "we are carrying out detailed 2-d and 3-d simulations of the m31 bulge region and comparisons with corresponding x - ray observations .",
    "the results will be reported in separate papers .",
    "stellar feedback is an important process in the co - evolution of galactic bulge and host galaxy .",
    "the two - stage stellar feedback model we have introduced in this paper naturally sets up the stellar feedback from a galactic bulge in the context of the assembly history of the host galaxy / halo . in the first stage , violent protogalaxy mergers in the fast - assembly regime trigger a starburst which quickly releases feedback energy through core - collapsed explosions to expel a large fraction of the circum - galactic gas ; in the second stage , the old stellar population in the bulge provides a long - lasting feedback via type ia sne to keep the gaseous halo hot . in this model , the sb feedback and the gradual feedback are roughly synchronized with the early violent merger stage and the later gentle accretion stage of the host galaxy , which is a generic picture of galaxy formation in the cdm model .",
    "a similar co - evolution scenario has been proposed for agn feedback @xcite . in their scenario ,",
    "a central massive black hole builds up its mass during galaxy mergers , and the black hole appears as a `` quasar '' ; when a static hot halo forms in the latter time , the cooling halo gas fuels the central massive black hole to make it active in a so - called low - energy radio mode .",
    "although our stellar feedback model and the agn feedback scenario are aimed at two different processes in galaxy formation , they share some common features .",
    "firstly , the feedback processes happen in two distinct regimes , an early energetic but short - term blow - out and a late low - energy level but long - lasting heating .",
    "secondly , the feedback and the galaxy formation are modeled in a co - evolving fashion . however , our stellar feedback model is proposed for the mw - sized galaxies , whereas the agn scenario is for more massive galaxies , which contribute to the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "much of existing work on stellar feedback is focused on whether a sb could drive a galactic superwind ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the model",
    "we have examined here , the question whether a sb - driven outflow can escape or not is not particularly relevant , because the galaxy is evolving and the galaxy environment is not gas - free . more relevant",
    "is the cooling time scale of the sb - heated material .",
    "this cooling time depends on the detailed physical processes involved in the interplay between massive stars and the ism , which our simple model does not take into account . depending largely on the assumed value of @xmath67",
    ", the sb - heated material may have already fallen back to the center or is still hanging in regions outside the galactic virial radius .",
    "our choice of the initial condition of the sb material ( the distribution scale ) guarantees that the cooling time - scale is long enough for the type ia sn - driven wind to develop an outflow .",
    "it is the rarification of the halo gas by the sb feedback that helps the type ia sn - driven outflow to gently blow out the accreted material and replenish the ism with mass from evolving stars .",
    "we mainly focus on a simultaneous solution to solve the `` over - cooling '' and `` missing energy '' problems in intermediate - mass ( @xmath124 ) galaxies with a substantial stellar bulge component .",
    "the combination of the sb and gradual stellar feedbacks is demonstrated to be a viable way to solve the problems . in the following",
    "we discuss briefly the limitations of our model .",
    "how galactic stellar bulges really form remains a question of debate .",
    "it is likely that there are multiple formation paths .",
    "a popular paradigm is the formation through galaxy merges ( instead of a monolithic collapse ) , which typically happen at high redshifts .",
    "in fact , our halo growth model is based on the average mass accretion history from @xmath1-body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after the last major merger , a bulge evolves nearly passively , except for some minor mergers .",
    "if the bulk of bulge stars are formed in a sb during the last major merge , our model still applies .",
    "however , if the bulge stars forms primarily from pre - existing stars by mergers ( the so - called dry mergers ) , a direct application of our model would not be appropriate . we have considered galaxies in `` isolation '' .",
    "this approximation may be reasonable for field galaxies , especially at high redshifts .",
    "but as shown in our simulations , the stellar feedback may have significant effects on scales considerably larger than the virial radius of individual galaxies .",
    "such impact may be sufficient to influence the igm environments of member galaxies in groups .",
    "for example , much of the gas in the local group , which contains two mw - like galaxies with a substantial stellar bulge component , may have been heated to a temperature of @xmath102 k ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : mwb4a ] ) .",
    "such hot gas with too low a density to be easily detected is consistent with the existing observations .",
    "but the stellar energy feedback in groups containing galaxies with more massive halos ( e.g. , giant ellipticals ) may have relatively minor effects , compared to the gravitational heating .    in our numerical model , mass accretion",
    "is assumed to be smooth . in reality , however , the accretion is more complicated .",
    "@xmath1-body simulations of cosmic structure formation have shown that dark matter halos acquire their masses mainly through lumpy mergers rather than smooth accretion .",
    "the sph galaxy formation simulations have further indicated that the gas accretion comes from both a smooth `` hot '' mode and a clumpy `` cold '' mode @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , lumpy accretions may give rise to higher entropy in the igm than smoothed accretion , and hence may result in less cooling .",
    "in addition , since denser clumps are difficult to be shock - heated ( e.g. @xcite ) , the gas accretion in different modes may lead to a multi - phase medium , which may alter the assembly history of the central galaxy , and hence changes the evolution of the stellar feedback and the thermal properties of the halo gas @xcite .",
    "while the details of such a multi - phase medium are still poorly understood , the clumpy accretion alone can not solve the `` overcooling '' and `` missing energy '' problems , unless additional pre - heating is injected into the gas before it is accreted ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the expectation is that the multi - phase medium may increase the gas accretion rate onto the central galaxy , hence boosting the predicted x - ray luminosity .",
    "the cold accretion may also be responsible to some of the observed hvcs around our galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in addition to those that might be produced by the cooled feedback material discussed in  3.1.4 .    for spiral galaxies",
    ", additional cool gas may be channeled into the bulge regions via gravitational perturbations because of the presence of a stellar bar .",
    "the heating of the gas ( e.g. , by thermal conduction ) may lead to mass - loading of the hot gas , increasing the x - ray luminosity and reducing the temperature of the gas .",
    "we will study such effects in a separate paper .",
    "we have examined the potential impacts of the galactic stellar bulge feedback on the hot gaseous structure and evolution around intermediate - mass galaxies with substantial bulge component .",
    "these are typically early - type spirals such as the mw , m31 and ellipticals with low @xmath0 ratios , indicating ongoing mass and energy outflows .",
    "the feedback in such a galaxy is approximately divided into two phases : 1 ) a sb - induced blastwave from the formation of the bulge and 2 ) a gradual energy and mass injection from evolved bulge stars .",
    "our 1-d model deals with the feedback in the galaxy evolution context , approximately accounting for the dark matter accretion history . we have carried out various simulations with this model to demonstrate the impacts and their dependences on key assumptions and parameters used .",
    "our major results and conclusions are as follows :    * the blastwave initiated during the sb and maintained by subsequent type ia sne in a galactic bulge may heat the igm beyond the virial radius , which may stop further gas accretion .",
    "the heated gas expands and produces a baryon deficit around the galaxy . *",
    "the high temperature and low density of the remaining gas in the galactic halo produces little x - ray emission , consistent with existing observations .",
    "thus the inclusion of both the sb and type ia sn feedbacks may provide a solution to the theoretical over - cooling problem .",
    "* with the low - density circum - galactic gaseous environment , the gradual stellar feedback , powered by type ia sne alone , can form a galactic bulge wind , especially when the bulge is young .",
    "much of the tenuous hot halo is occupied by the thermalized bulge wind material .",
    "the bulge wind region shrinks and likely turns into a subsonic outflow as the sn rate decreases .",
    "this wind / outflow naturally explains the _ missing stellar feedback _ problem of galactic bulges .",
    "* we find that a subsonic outflow from a galactic bulge can be a long - lasting state , the properties of which depend sensitively on the environment and formation history of the galaxy .",
    "this dependency may account for the large dispersion in the x - ray luminosities of galaxies with similar @xmath69 .",
    "* the condensation of the gas injected during the sb may provide an explanation of hvcs observed with moderate metal enrichment .",
