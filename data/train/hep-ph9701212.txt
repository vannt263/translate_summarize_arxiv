    "as explained before we shall employ the approach of bsw @xcite to calculate form factors at @xmath72 in terms of relativistic bound state wave functions in the infinite momentum frame . in the relativistic bsw approach the hadrons are described as relativistic bound states of a heavy active quark @xmath73 and a heavy or light spectator state , which , in our case is a spin - isospin zero light diquark state .",
    "a relativistic bound state of a quark - diquark pair in the imf is written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the creation operator for the heavy quark and @xmath76 the creation operator for the light diquark and where @xmath77 , @xmath78 represent the momentum and spin of the heavy quark ( light diquark ) , respectively .",

    "the two light degrees of freedom are treated as a single quasi - elementary constituent and are represented by a spin - isospin zero diquark with @xmath82 $ ] quantum numbers . because the diquark always shows up as a spectator in the overlap integrals it is of no significance whether or not it is a true bound state .",

    "the behaviour of the wave function ( [ nm ] ) in the endpoint regions @xmath111 and @xmath112 is controlled by the power dependent terms @xmath113 and @xmath114 . as the endpoint behaviour of the light diquark system can be expected to be the same as that of the heavy quark the choice @xmath115 seems to be a natural one .",
    "we note that for light baryons this choice is not optimal @xcite .",
    "finally , in our numerical work we take @xmath116 .",
    "this is suggested by the similarity of the baryonic heavy quark - light diquark system and the mesonic heavy quark - light antiquark system for which this choice has been found to be appropriate @xcite . for the sake of comparison",
    "we also compute numerical results for the powers @xmath117 .",
    "we mention that the polarization predictions of our model are only weakly dependent on the choice of @xmath109 and @xmath110 , whereas the rate prediction does depend on the choice of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "to leading order in the imf momentum p one finds two relations for the heavy baryon decay form factors .",
    "these two relations correspond to the 0- and 3-component of the transition current which represent leading order contributions in the imf momentum p and are thus termed good. the 1- and 2- components are bad , because in the latter , particles moving with @xmath118 or @xmath119 can not be excluded .",
    "for these the extra powers of p in the denominator can be compensated by similar factors in the numerator from the matrix elements of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , thus mimicking a constant behaviour though they may hide terms proportional to p as p@xmath122 .",
    "a more phenomenological argument why we have decided to keep only first order expressions in the matrix elements is that many approximations were made in our parton model approach .",
    "first of all , though we set @xmath123 , there may be components of the heavy quark momentum perpendicular to the z - direction of @xmath124 .",
    "such transverse momenta , as well as off - shell effects , the light cone factorization in @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which is not rotationally invariant , and the decoupling of spin and orbital momenta lead to modifications of order @xmath125 . despite of this the bad current relations are in agreement with hqet",
    "as we show in an appendix , there is only a little difficulty with the reduced form factor @xmath40 .",
    "our subsequent analysis is based on the good current components only .",

    "( [ alp ] ) and the numbers in table  2 , the fb asymmetry on the hadron side can be expected to be comfortably large in comparison to the small fb asymmetry on the lepton side .",
    "the fb asymmetry measures are quite interesting when one wants to determine the chirality of the @xmath232 transition . in the left - chiral case ,",
    "as predicted by the standard model , the @xmath30-quark , and thereby the @xmath171 baryon , is predominantly in the negative helicity state . as the asymmetry parameter @xmath242 is also negative , and",
    "thereby the helicity of the @xmath0 predominantly negative , the helicities want to align , and one has an altogether positive fb asymmetry",
    ". a right - chiral @xmath232 transition would , on the contrary , yield a negative fb asymmetry .",
    "the size of the predicted fb asymmetry is large enough to accommodate even large errors in this measurement to exclude or confirm the sm prediction for the chirality of the @xmath232 transition .",
    "the fb asymmetry on the lepton side is again predicted to be positive if the @xmath232 transition is left - chiral .",
    "again this can be understood from simple helicity arguments .",
    "there are , however , two reasons that the lepton side fb asymmetry measure is not optimal .",
    "first , it is predicted to be quite small ( @xmath243 in our model ) , and second , one uses the left handedness of the lepton current as input to analyze the chirality of the @xmath232 coupling . if the weak interaction were mediated by a non sm right - handed gauge boson @xmath244 with right - handed couplings at the lepton _ and _ hadron side one would have the same lepton - side fb asymmetry even though the @xmath232 transition is right chiral .",
    "that is consistent with all present data has been recently proposed in ref.@xcite . ]",
    "the hadron - side fb asymmetry measure involves @xmath245-odd spin - momentum correlations and thus is a direct measure of the @xmath232 chirality whereas the lepton - side fb asymmetry involves @xmath245-even momentum - momentum correlations only and is therefore not optimally suited for the determination of the @xmath232 chirality , unless , of course , one presumes the handedness of @xmath246 is known .    in table  2",
    "we also list the value of the azimuthal asymmetry parameter @xmath247 which describes the azimuthal correlation of the lepton - side and the hadron - side decay planes .",
    "the corresponding azimuthal distribution is given by @xmath248 where @xmath249 and where @xmath250 is the relative azimuth of the two decay planes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath247 can be seen to be the transverse component @xmath251 ( in the lepton plane ) of the polarization vector of the daughter baryon @xmath171 .",
    "since we have taken the decay amplitudes to be relatively real there is no @xmath252 component ( out of the lepton plane ) and correspondingly no azimuthal term proportional to sin@xmath250 in the angular decay distribution ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "the presence of a @xmath252 polarization component would signal the presence of cp - violating effects and/or final state interaction effects which we shall not discuss in this paper .    for completeness",
    "we list in table  2 also the values for the asymmetry parameters @xmath253 and @xmath254 relevant for polarized @xmath161 decays .",
    "they are related to polar and azimuthal correlations between the polarization vector of the @xmath161 and the momentum of the @xmath171 and the decay products of the @xmath171 as described in @xcite .",
    "an analysis of these decay correlations is of relevance for @xmath161 s originating from z - decays which are expected to be produced with a substantial amount of polarization @xcite .",
    "we must mention , though , that a first analysis of the polarization of @xmath161 s from the z did not confirm theoretical expectations of a large @xmath161 polarization @xcite .",
    "table  2 shows that the asymmetry parameters are not very dependent on whether the imf quark model or the dipole model is used as input despite the fact that there are rate differences between the two .",
    "when taking the asymmetry ratios differences in the @xmath3-dependence of the form factors tend to drop out and one remains with the underlying spin dynamics which is approximately the same in both models .",
    "even when going to the extreme case of choosing flat form factors for @xmath255 and @xmath206 the asymmetry values do not change much ( see table  2 ) .",
    "we have checked that the same statement holds true when one chooses @xmath156 for the endpoint power behaviour in the imf quark model .",
    "finally we remark that the form factors and the numerical rate values presented in this paper are derived from unrenormalized current vertices .",
    "the renormalization effects can easily be incorporated as discussed in detail in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the renormalization effects are very small close to the zero recoil point @xmath70 and become largest at maximum recoil @xmath59 . numerically they tend to increase the rates by approximately 10% but leave the asymmetry values practically unchanged .",
    "we have used a infinite momentum frame quark model that was improved by using results from hqet to calculate the @xmath256 transition form factors and to give detailed predictions for rates , spectra and polarization dependent observables in the semileptonic decay @xmath257 ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "we have employed heavy quark  light diquark imf wave functions in which the @xmath85-dependence of the wave function resembles that of a mesonic heavy quark ",
    "light antiquark system . in our analysis",
    "we have only made use of the so - called good components of the quark transition currents .",
    "it is important to realize that any bsw - type infinite momentum frame quark model calculation does not take into account possible spin - spin interactions between the heavy side and the light side as they occur in general in a @xmath52 hqet treatment .",
    "it is for this reason that a calculation such as the one presented in @xcite will lead to inconsistencies when comparing the infinite momentum quark model results with the general @xmath52 hqet structure . in the case of the calculation of @xcite",
    "this inconsistency can be exhibited by taking also the @xmath259 channel into account , in addition to the @xmath260 treated in @xcite . as mentioned",
    "before there are no spin - spin interactions between the heavy side and the light side in the case of the @xmath256 transitions and thus the infinite momentum frame structure is fully consistent with the @xmath52 hqet structure in this special case .    at this point",
    "it is appropiate to summarize the uncertainties in our model predictions .",
    "the most important parameters are @xmath109 and @xmath110 controlling the powers of @xmath89 and @xmath261 in the wave function . of less importance",
    "are the oscillator parameter @xmath29 and the mass difference @xmath102 which determines the position of the maximum of the wave function .",
    "the @xmath24 reduced form factor @xmath34 depends only on @xmath110 and on the product of @xmath102 and @xmath29 while the @xmath52 form factor @xmath40 depends on all parameters .",
    "while our analytical results are given for all values of @xmath109 and @xmath110 we have discussed two specific choices of the parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 in our numerical analysis , namely @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the choice @xmath155 is characterized by a relatively small value of the charge radius @xmath176 and , hence , a large exclusive semileptonic decay rate of the @xmath161 which will amount to a substantial fraction of the total inclusive semileptonic @xmath161 decay rate .",
    "larger values of @xmath110 lead to larger values of the charge radius and thus to smaller exclusive semileptonic decay rates .",
    "although we favor the choice @xmath262 the question of which value one finally has to choose for @xmath110 has to settled by experiment . there is first experimental evidence that @xmath155 is the preferred choice @xcite . for a given value of @xmath110 the magnitude of the @xmath52 reduced form factor and thereby the rate increases with @xmath109 . whereas the rates are strongly dependent on the choice of @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    "our polarization predictions show only a weak dependence on the choice of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    before concluding this paper we would like to comment on an alternative imf quark model calculation of the @xmath256 transition form factors @xcite",
    ". the imf approach of @xcite has many features in common with the present model calculation : the large form factors @xmath255 and @xmath206 are calculated from overlap integrals of the initial and final state hadronic wave functions for which the same quark - diquark light - cone wave function is used as here .",
    "the other form factors @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 are estimated in the same way as we do here , namely from the hqet relations .",
    "the difference between the two approaches is that in @xcite the overlap integrals are evaluated for all values of the momentum transfer @xmath60 ( or @xmath3 ) for given masses @xmath263 , @xmath264 while in this paper we use overlap integrals only at @xmath59 varying @xmath3 through the mass ratio @xmath265 .",
    "as was mentioned above the overlap integrals at @xmath59 are on rather save theoretical grounds , whereas those at @xmath266 are somewhat less reliable . on the other hand , the imf that is being used here can not be reached from any frame of finite momentum by a lorentz transformation .",
    "the results of the two models are , on the other hand , rather similar mathematically as well as numerically ( c.f",
    ".  tables  1,2 ) .",
    "this gives us additional confidence in our predictions .",
    "the main difference between the predictions is that the form factors used in this paper exhibit a singularity at @xmath267 ( see eq .",
    "( [ itildedef ] ) ) which has no physical interpretation while the form factor singularity in @xcite appears at @xmath268 at physical threshold .",
    "however , due to the normalization condition at zero recoil this difference does not matter much numerically in the decay region .",
    "in this appendix we list the two additional equations relating form factors and quark model overlap integrals when also the bad quark current components are used .",
    "using similar techniques as in the main part of the paper one finds @xmath269 where one now has a different overlap integral @xmath270 it is clear that only the form factors @xmath255 and @xmath206 associated with the covariants @xmath271 and @xmath272 enter into the bad current relations since the covariants @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 and @xmath276 have no transverse components .",
    "proceeding as in the main text we expand the overlap integral @xmath277 according to @xmath278 \\tilde{j}^{(1)}(\\omega ) + ...                                                                \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath279 note that the zeroth order coefficient of @xmath280 is identical to the zeroth order coefficient @xmath139 ( see eq .",
    "( [ itilde ] ) ) .",
    "similarly we expand the mass factors in eq .",
    "( [ ffresult ] ) up to @xmath281 using @xmath282 .",
    "one obtains @xmath283    in sec .",
    "3 we have argued that the relations ( [ ffresult ] ) obtained from the bad current components are not so reliable .",
    "one can nevertheless ponder the question which kind of relations one obtains for the form factors if the combined set of four equations ( [ 0and3a],[0and3b ] ) and ( [ ffresult ] ) is used as a starting point .",
    "in particular one can ask oneself whether one can now derive the hqet relations eqs .",
    "( [ fivfiaone],[kkp ] ) or ( [ georgi ] ) .    at @xmath24",
    "one derives from the bad current relations eq .",
    "( [ ffresult ] ) @xmath284 where the zero recoil condition @xmath285 is satisfied . substituting this result into the good current relations eq .",
    "( [ 0and3a],[0and3b ] ) one finds @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "further one has the charge conjugation relations @xmath288 and @xmath289 which then imply that @xmath290 .",
    "this then establishes that the @xmath24 hqet result eq .",
    "( [ fivfiaone ] ) can in fact be derived when both the good and bad current quark model relations are used .",
    "turning now to the @xmath52 results , the bad current relation eq .",
    "( [ ffresult ] ) immediately leads to the first of the hqet results in eq .",
    "( [ georgi ] ) upon using the expansion ( [ weissnich ] ) . as for the good current relations",
    ", one has to identify the hqet parameter @xmath38 with the quark model parameter @xmath102 , i.e.  @xmath291 .",
    "the reduced form factor @xmath40 ( see ( [ kkp ] ) ) can also be calculated from the bad current relations ( [ ffresult ] ) upon using the expansion ( [ weissnich ] ) again .",
    "in fact one finds @xmath292\\ ] ] which differs from the solution ( [ solution ] ) obtained from the good current relations .",
    "while the reduced form factor @xmath293 is fairly small in the @xmath41 decay region as compared to @xmath34 it is not zero at @xmath70 . with regard to the approximations involved in the bad current components ( see the discussion in sect .  3 ) this little inconsistency in the @xmath52 results can be tolerated allowing us to conclude that even the bad current relations are in reasonable agreement with hqet .",
