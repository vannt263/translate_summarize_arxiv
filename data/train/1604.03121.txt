    "in the early part of this decade , a long - awaited discovery was made : the first transiting circumbinary planet from _",
    "kepler_. this planet , kepler-16 , was reported by @xcite . since then , another eleven circumbinary planets ( cbps ) have been found , including the only known circumbinary multi - planet system , kepler-47 @xcite . while the sample of planets is still small",
    ", a few unique characteristics have emerged .",
    "@xcite observe that there are no very massive , close - in planets , and the known planets tend to reside close to the stability limit of the binary .",
    "although these trends might arise coincidentally due to the small sample size , if real , they hint at differences in the formation and evolution of planets around binary and single stars . in this work , we aim to tease out whether circumbinary disks might preferentially form lower mass planets near the stability boundary , or if dynamical processes sculpt the systems into what we observe .",
    "transiting cbps provide important insight into planet formation and planetary dynamics because we can investigate the interplay and timeline of binary star formation and planet formation .",
    "most simply , formation  in - situ \" around the binary is strongly favored .",
    "@xcite find that the observed cbp population is consistent with formation in a co - planar disk , unless the formation efficiency for cbps drastically exceeds that for single stars .",
    "this similarity aside , the formation mechanisms for cbps may be somewhat different than those posited for planets around single stars .",
    "circumprimary / secondary protoplanetary disks are often truncated or less massive in close binaries , leaving less planet - forming material , while circumbinary disks can be as massive as a single - star disk @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the population of the debris disks around binaries do not show flux deficits , as might be expected given the reduced mass in the parent population @xcite . @xcite",
    "propose that cbp formation might happen more efficiently in dead zones ( quiescent regions in the disk mid - plane ) , which could produce gas giants easily . on the other hand ,",
    "the binary can excite substantial eccentricity in the protoplanetary disk , inhibiting planet formation near the binary .",
    "the eccentric disk gives rise to eccentric planetesimals which suffer high velocity collisions that lead to erosion instead of growth , pushing planet formation to larger radii ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if a planet instead forms in the outer disk and migrates inward due to tidal interactions with the disk , one might still expect planets to exist close to the stars , which @xcite posit to be the likely scenario .",
    "@xcite find that a planet forming in the outer disk can migrate toward the stability limit but will probably be pumped to moderate eccentricity along the way .",
    "additionally , @xcite find that massive planets , if they exist around binaries , are probably found at larger radii because tidal torques from the binary cause outward migration .",
    "we must also consider planet formation in the presence of binary evolution . there is a lack of observed planets around short period binaries ( periods less than about 7 days ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "models proposed in @xcite and @xcite suggest that these binaries form on wider orbits and then migrate due to tidal circularization stemming from kozai oscillations induced by a tertiary companion .",
    "@xcite suggest that this is prohibitive for cbp existence around a tight binary , while @xcite and @xcite posit that cbps may just become very misaligned .",
    "both of these scenarios would provide a dearth of transiting cbps around close binaries .",
    "formation alone , however , does not explain the present - day orbits in planetary systems around single stars .",
    "previous works , such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have looked at the impact of planet scattering on planet populations around single stars . @xcite and @xcite have extended this to understand dynamical evolution over the full stellar lifetime . specifically , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have found that the observed exoplanet sample is consistent with significant sculpting by dynamical evolution .",
    "this naturally raises the question of how scattering is modified around binaries .",
    "the addition of a second massive body substantially changes stability very close to the binary . @xcite",
    "have shown empirically that orbits within about two times the binary semi - major axis are unstable on very short timescales , suggesting that neither planets nor the natal disk should exist in this region . however",
    ", it is unclear how significantly planets on wider orbits will be impacted except at special locations such as mean motion resonances with the binary .",
    "one possible avenue of further evolution is the modest eccentricity excitation at semi - major axis 2 - 10 times the binary semi - major axis , which may fundamentally change the course of planet - planet scattering and thereby change the resultant population . in this work",
    "we aim to understand the impact of the binary on planet populations sculpted by planet - planet scattering . by isolating the role of the binary in any differential evolution due to scattering , we can determine",
    "which differences are imprinted by formation .    to address the interplay between the formation and dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets ,",
    "we perform n - body integrations of planets around single and binary stars .",
    "we study the binary s impact on a wide range of different planet populations , investigate the changes in orbital properties as a result of dynamical processes , and compare the resultant populations around single and binary stars .",
    "we first review previous work in section  [ stab ] . in section",
    "[ methods ] , we discuss the methods used to carry out our study and explain our choice of systems and planet populations . section  [ results ] details the differences we see between the various planet populations and between planetary systems around single and binary stars .",
    "section  [ disc ] discusses the physical intuition for the reduction of collisions , the role of giant planets in system evolution , and the observable properties of our systems .",
    "while any system of three or more bodies may be chaotic , there are several limiting cases where orbits are well behaved .",
    "the simplest case is that of two planets around a single star that are hill stable , which means that they can not suffer close encounters .",
    "@xcite explored hill stability for low mass , low eccentricity , co - planar bodies and found that systems of two planets are hill stable for orbital separations greater than @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the masses of the planets and @xmath3 is the mass of the central star ; here , the orbital radius of the inner planet is taken to be 1 .",
    "multi - planet stability is often referenced to the two - planet hill stability limit by measuring planet spacing in terms of a mutual hill radius : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the semi - major axes of the planets .",
    "we define the dimensionless spacing of planets in terms of mutual hill radii as : @xmath7 note that in some regimes , @xmath8 may not provide the best metric for planetary stability ( see @xcite ) .",
    "previous works such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have studied the impact of @xmath8 on the dynamical `` lifetime , '' meaning the timescale for planets to enter crossing orbits , for systems of three or more equal mass planets around a single star .",
    "they find that the lifetime of a system decreases with increasing planet mass , planet eccentricity ( @xmath9 ) , and system multiplicity , and increases with the initial spacing measured by @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite suggested that gyr stability requires @xmath1010 for @xmath11 planet systems and @xcite found that a spacing of @xmath108 is required for myr stability in systems with five or more equal mass planets .",
    "@xcite investigated two - planet circumbinary systems and found that they are long - term stable ( @xmath12 binary orbits ) with @xmath107 .",
    "because we are interested in cbps of higher multiplicity and non - constant mass , we therefore might expect our planet distributions to require larger spacing than this in order to be stable for tens to hundreds of millions of binary orbits .",
    "our integrations are carried out with a gauss - radau variable timestep integrator in a modified version of the n - body  orbital integration package _ mercury _  from @xcite .",
    "the standard variable time step orbit integrators included in the code such as bulirsch - stoer and gauss - radau are agnostic about the number of massive bodies or hierarchy of the system , and therefore are well suited to planet - binary integrations in general @xcite .",
    "while binary symplectic integrators exist @xcite , these still require switching to a b - s style integration to resolve close encounters .",
    "if encounters are common , the integrator will be forced to use b - s integration schemes for a significant fraction of the integration .",
    "because of _ mercury _ s origins as a planetary system integration package , most calculations are carried out in heliocentric coordinates . while this poses no challenge for the main n - body   integration for some integrators , any part of the code which relies on assumptions of keplerian orbits about a central body requires modification , such as the close encounter checks . the changes to _ mercury _",
    "described herein remove this assumption when the user sets a flag for a central binary in one of the input files .",
    "this new version of the code is available for download online .",
    "we briefly describe the main modifications below .",
    "all of our integrations were carried out with the @xcite radau integrator , although the modifications should work with other adaptive time step methods .    * for circumbinary systems ,",
    "we treat close encounters between any two bodies in the same way , in contrast to the standard _ mercury _  practice of treating encounters with the central star separately . for any pair of bodies , the code searches for close encounters based on the current cartesian state vectors . for the radau integrator ,",
    "interactions flagged as close encounters do not effect the overall time stepping in the code .",
    "this is in contrast to hybrid symplectic integrators that use a close encounter flag to choose interactions to further resolve . for the radau integrator",
    ", the variable time step ensures that interactions down to the close encounter radius of a particle are well resolved . for planet encounters , we use 1 @xmath13 as the close encounter radius , following previous work @xcite . for stars",
    ", we use the empirical stellar mass - radius relationship from @xcite to determine the radii as a function of mass .",
    "we set the close encounter radius to three stellar radii for our fiducial runs .",
    "note that the central body radius and second star s radius are set in the subroutine `` ` mfo_user_centralradius ` , '' which can be easily modified to incorporate any prescription . * collisions , like close encounters",
    ", are also calculated for every pair of bodies based on cartesian state vectors .",
    "they are calculated based on extrapolation from the close encounter radius over a time step .",
    "we use _ mercury _ s third order interpolation scheme for all bodies , which ignores the gravitational contributions of all other bodies during the encounter . for planet - planet encounters ,",
    "the choice of close encounter radius between 1/4 and 1 @xmath13 does not change the number of planet - planet collisions , so we have chosen the default of 1 @xmath13 to avoid the computational cost of very small time steps . for star - planet encounters , where ignoring the gravitational accelerations from one of the stars is most severe , the time step is always sufficiently short compared to the orbital period that the star moves of order 1 stellar radius during the extrapolated encounter .",
    "the time step is guaranteed to be small ,  1/1000th of an orbital period , because the small close encounter radius for stars forces very high time resolution during close approaches . to achieve even better accuracy for stellar collisions , one can set the close encounter radius equal to the collision radius to force the integrator to resolve all collisions explicitly .",
    "we find that the number of stellar collisions for an equal mass binary is exactly the same for close encounter radii from 1 to 3 stellar radii ; however , because of the inherent chaos of the systems and the different time resolutions , the time of collision , and the binary component that suffered a collision , may change . * the standard _ mercury _  routines for calculating jacobi coordinates and planetary hill radii must also be modified to account for both re - ordering of planets and the offset between the system center of mass and the central body .",
    "we include a new jacobi coordinate routine that employs a bubble sort algorithm to re - order bodies by distance before performing a coordinate transform from heliocentric coordinates .",
    "hill radii for close encounters are calculated using the distance from the system center of mass , rather than semi - major axis , and incorporate the enclosed mass instead of the mass from a single central body . * finally",
    ", we apply the bug fix reported in @xcite that fixes a status initialization problem , although this is not used in the current study .",
    "using this modified version of _ mercury _ , we obtain an average energy conservation of about @xmath14 over our 10 myr ( @xmath15 binary orbits ) integration time , with ranges from @xmath16 to @xmath14 .",
    "our angular momentum conservation is of order @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite , who also used a custom version of _ mercury _ found an energy error of up to @xmath17 using their hybrid symplectic / bulirsch - stoer scheme .",
    "we have also performed a code comparison with another publicly available integrator , rebound , @xcite .",
    "we employ their 15th order integration scheme which is similar to radau , but conserves energy significantly better @xcite .",
    "the trade off is of course a dramatic ( order of magnitude ) increase in run time , which made it unfeasible for use in this parameter study .",
    "while rebound automatically treats encounters between any pair of bodies equivalently and operates in barycentric coordinates , one must modify collision routines and ensure that the system does not drift out of the box by frequently resetting the system back to the center of mass .",
    "for integrations of identical initial conditions drawn from our fiducial sample we achieved very good agreement between the two integrators ( 0.1% difference for planet - planet and planet - star collisions and 1.7% difference in ejections and remaining planets when the systems are run to @xmath18 years ) . note that , due to the highly chaotic nature of the orbits , numerical errors introduced by the different integration algorithm are expected to produce small changes in orbit outcomes for a given planet .",
    "additionally , the ejection algorithms , in particular , are different ( _ mercury _  ejects from a sphere , while rebound ejects from a cube ) , so we expect small differences in the outcomes from these effects , as well .",
    "there are two major influences on the long term evolution of cbps : the properties of the binary system and the structure of the planetary system .",
    "because the primordial conditions of circumbinary systems are uncertain , we consider a range of planet populations and binary configurations to investigate the dependence upon initial conditions .",
    "we do not use the observed planetary statistics for our populations because observed systems may already be sculpted by scattering .",
    "our systems are initialized with ten planets that have been randomly drawn from the planet populations described below .",
    "our fiducial binary is equal mass and circular with components of 0.5@xmath19  separated by 0.1  au , which gives a 10 day period .",
    "we make no assumptions about stability other than re - sampling any planet that falls within the @xcite circumbinary stability limit of @xmath20 ( equation 5 in their text ) where @xmath21 is the planet semi - major axis computed from the system barycenter and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the binary .",
    "this resampling forbids initial conditions interior to the probable disk truncation edge .",
    "planets are unlikely to have formed or even migrated into this region and may contribute to overall system destabilization , thus polluting our statistics .",
    "we apply the same initial semi - major axis cutoff for planets around a single star as we do for the binary to ensure consistency between our populations , although no such restrictions exist around single stars .",
    "thus , very short period planets are initially forbidden around single stars but can be scattered inward during the simulation .",
    "each distribution is integrated with both our fiducial binary and a single star with a mass of 1@xmath19 making the effective central mass in both cases the same . for a subset of planet populations ,",
    "we vary the binary eccentricity and/or mass ratio ( we define mass ratio as @xmath24 ) ; these variations are listed in table  [ tab : pcts ] .",
    "although we only study one binary orbital period herein , our results are mostly scalable to wider periods , as we discuss in section [ close ] .    for all populations",
    ", we assume the eccentricity and inclination ( @xmath25 ) distributions of @xcite , who used a rayleigh distribution with scale parameter @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "inclinations are somewhat uncertain , so we remain with the low inclination distribution to represent a mostly flat disk formation scenario , such as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity we use is roughly consistent with the observations of @xcite , who find that observed planets follow a rayleigh distribution with scale parameter @xmath28 .",
    "our mass and semi - major axis distributions are described below .",
    "all orbital elements henceforth are described with respect to the system barycenter .    * jt08 * : :    this distribution serves as our reference sample and is taken directly    from the @xcite `` c10s10 '' ensemble to compare cbps to previous    simulations around single stars .",
    "planet masses are drawn from a log    uniform sample ranging from 0.1 to 10 @xmath29  and    semi - major axes are drawn from a log uniform sample between 0.1 and    100  au .",
    "* mmhr * : :    the mmhr ( matched mutual hill radius ) distribution matches the initial    planet - planet spacing of jt08 , as measured by the mutual hill radius    spacing , but with lower mass planets and smaller semi - major axes .",
    "the    planets are drawn from a log uniform distribution spanning 1 to 160    @xmath30  in mass and log uniform from 0.1 to 1.7  au in    semi - major axis .",
    "we choose this population to highlight the impact of    binary - planet perturbations .",
    "the dynamical spacing of planets ( a    measure of the strength of inter - planet perturbations ) is the same as    in jt08 , but binary perturbations will be stronger because of the    compact nature of the population .",
    "* mordasini * : :    this planet population is modeled after the population synthesis    models of @xcite .",
    "the semi - major axes span a range from 0.1 to    15  au with a peak at 3  au .",
    "the masses span 1@xmath31    @xmath30 , with a dominant peak at low mass and small    peaks around 1 @xmath32  and 1    @xmath29 .",
    "the mordasini data from which our    distributions are taken do have a correlation in mass - semi - major axis    space ; however , our randomly drawn planets do not take this    two - dimensional density into account . * lm * : :    in order to capture the properties of observed exoplanets around    single stars , even though the present - day distribution may not be    primordial , we create the lm ( low mass ) planet population .",
    "we apply    the empirical planetary mass - radius relations from @xcite , @xcite ,    and @xcite to observed radii distributions from @xcite , @xcite , and    @xcite to create an average mass distribution for exoplanets .",
    "we then    match an analytic expression for the probability distribution function    using an exponential with flat probabilities at @xmath33    @xmath30  and @xmath34    @xmath30 , as shown in equation  [ eq : lm ] .",
    "+    @xmath35    +    figure  [ lmmass ] shows the average mass distribution in the thick black    line and the analytic fit used for the lm distribution in the thick    magenta line .",
    "we draw masses from 1@xmath31    @xmath30 ; most planets have masses less than 20    @xmath30 .",
    "the semi - major axes are drawn from a gamma    distribution with mean 4.5  au and range approximately 0.115  au .",
    "@xmath30  and @xmath36 @xmath30  as shown in equation 3 .",
    "we use this mass distribution to produce an observationally motivated planet sample .",
    "[ lmmass ] ]      we integrate 100 different realizations for each system architecture for 10 myr . each system begins with 10 planets .",
    "a planet is considered ejected if it travels more than 1000  au from the primary star .",
    "note that , for the widely spaced planet populations , there is a small subset of high eccentricity , high semi - major axis planets that are removed from the system while still bound .",
    "however , these planets are a minority and would likely not contribute greatly to the further dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "collisions between all objects are allowed in a mass and momentum conserving form ( we do not allow collisional erosion or tidal dissipation ) .",
    "planetary radii are calculated using mass and an assumed density of @xmath37g/@xmath38 .",
    "this assumed density best describes a normal giant planet , such as jupiter .",
    "for the range of densities of known _ kepler _  systems , we underestimate the radius by at most a factor of two for the least dense planet and overestimate by a factor of three for the most dense planet .",
    "our assumption of a constant density should have negligible impact on planetary collisions ; in fact , because most of our planets are smaller than jupiter , we should more frequently overestimate the radii and therefore overestimate collisions .",
    "it is important to note that this problem is scale free aside from collisions , which of course set an absolute radius .",
    "otherwise , binary and planetary orbits can be scaled up or down , with the timescale adjusted accordingly .",
    "because we find that collisions of any kind are relatively rare for most distributions , the trends presented here should be applicable to wider circumbinary systems . in these systems",
    "one would expect collisions to occur even less frequently due to increased distances between objects .",
    "the primary difference we observe between planetary systems around single and binary stars is the loss mechanism of unstable planets .",
    "circumbinary planets are lost almost exclusively by ejections , whereas single star planetary systems undergo a substantial number of planet - planet and planet - star collisions .",
    "the evolution at 10  myr has reached a near steady state ; most systems have non - crossing planetary orbits that have changed little over the last few myr .",
    "figure  [ nvt ] shows the average number of planets remaining in the system as a function of time .",
    "figure  [ pies ] shows the outcomes for planets in the four populations . despite the differences in outcome , single stars and binaries asymptote towards similar orbital distributions , except for the most compact , packed initial populations .",
    "though the final distributions of orbital elements for each planet population are relatively invariant with central object , each planet population retains a `` memory '' of its original state , which can be seen in figure  [ bvs ] ; the shapes of the final distributions vary significantly between different initial populations",
    ".    scattering does not appear to account for the pileup of observed planets near the stability limit , nor do binaries preferentially lose massive planets close to the binary .",
    "scattering thus does not reproduce these noticeable features of the observed cbp population . however , the fate of planets that begin or are scattered close to the binary star ( within @xmath39 ) is different from those that never enter this region , as we explore in section  [ close ] .",
    "we discuss in section  [ massive ] that the presence or absence of a giant planet has greater impact on the dynamical evolution of a system than the central object .",
    "the four planet distributions around the fiducial binary show a factor of @xmath4030 reduction in planet - star collisions .",
    "planet - planet collisions are reduced by 12 times , and ejections are enhanced by factors of 1.52.5 .",
    "we provide a physical explanation for these differences in section  [ explanation ] .",
    "the average number of planets remaining in a system as a function of time is generally similar between the single star and the binary case .",

    "the dotted black line shows the jt08 single star case as a reference . in every case but mmhr",
    ", the single and binary systems lose very similar numbers of planets . however , the rate of loss can vary , with the binary systems tending to lose planets faster at early times .",
    "in contrast to the other distributions , the lm planet population is still dynamically evolving at 10 myr because low mass planet - planet encounters rarely lead to ejections .",
    "[ nvt ] ]    * jt08 * : :    the jt08 set of initial conditions is the only one in which we have a    direct comparison to previous work .",
    "we present the results of the    @xcite `` c10s10 '' integration alongside our own in table  [ tab : pcts ]    and see that the single star integrations are consistent .",
    "+    over our 1000 planet sample for each of the binary and single star    tests , we found a nearly equal number of remaining planets , an    enhancement of 1.3 in ejection rates for the binary case , a reduction    of 17.6 times in the number of planet - star collisions , and a factor of    2.1 reduction in planet - planet collisions .",
    "the loss mechanism is shown    graphically in the first column of figure  [ pies ] , which depicts the    fractional distribution of planet outcomes at 10  myr .",
    "the average    number of planets remaining at the end of the integration times is    also shown in table  [ tab : pcts ] , which lists both the fiducial binary    ( @xmath42 ) and variations on binary eccentricity and    mass ratio . because we do nt run all variations on the binary to    10  myr",

    "the large increase in    ejections in the binary case can be attributed to the compactness of    the population ( the median mmhr semi - major ax is    @xmath430.6  au or @xmath44 , as opposed to    @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 for    jt08 , mordasini , and lm , respectively ) .",

    ", there is no significant change in the number    of planets remaining , a factor of 1.3 more ejections for cbps , and    reductions of 28.6 and 1.6 in planet - star and planet - planet    collisions , respectively .",

    "figure  [ bvs ] compares the initial and final distributions of single and circumbinary planetary systems for the four planet populations .",
    "the semi - major axis distributions are broadened as planets are scattered to larger distances ( or smaller , in the single star case , albeit rarely ) .",
    "the peaks of the final eccentricity distributions are similar to the initial distributions , but with a tail at high eccentricities .",
    "lower mass planets are preferentially lost , leaving dominant populations of higher mass planets .",
    "the inclination distributions ( in the binary case , as measured relative to the binary s angular momentum axis ) also develop a small tail at higher inclinations , but the majority of planets follow the initial distributions .",
    "finally , the @xmath8 distributions narrow and shift to higher values , peaking between 10 and 30 @xmath49 .",
    "this is similar to the observed packing of _ kepler _  single star systems reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mmhr planet population has the most variation between the single and binary cases , with the semi - major axis , eccentricity , and inclination all having an anderson - darling p - value less than 1% .",
    "thus , an initially compact and packed planetary system evolves differently around a binary .",
    "although both binary and single star systems are initialized without very close - in planets , single stars accumulate a sizable population of short period planets .",

    "our most important findings are as follows :    1 .",
    "the average loss rate for planets is very similar between single star planetary systems and cbps for a range of initial orbital distributions , though there is a weak dependence on the compactness of the initial semi - major axis distribution .",
    "planets packed closer to the binary will be more perturbed .",
    "the loss method between single star and binary systems is very different .",
    "circumbinary systems always have far more ejections than the single star planetary systems , and both planet - planet and planet - star collisions are suppressed around binaries ( planet - star collisions often by an order of magnitude ) . using intuition based off the cr3bp ,",
    "these reductions are expected because the orbital phase space in which planets are perturbed and rapidly ejected is much larger than the phase space allowing stellar collisions .",
    "we speculate that the reduction of collisions in circumbinary systems may lead to a measurably lower atmospheric metallicity in close binaries than in single stars or wide binaries .",

    "we also find that systems similar to kepler-47 , while not common , are not prohibited by scattering .",
    "systems with a giant planet evolve differently than those without one .",
    "the highest multiplicity systems do not have massive planets .",
    "however , the presence of a giant planet has a similar impact on single and binary star systems .",
    "we have shown that intrinsic differences in the populations of cbps and exoplanets around single stars likely arise from differences in formation or disk - driven orbital evolution .",
    "we see no evidence that the lack of observed giant planets nor the pile - up of planets around the binary instability boundary can be attributed to planet - planet and planet - star scattering . and yet , the binary does impact planets that come within roughly a factor of 10 of the binary semi - major axis .",
    "planets born in - situ on close - in orbits are most likely to evolve differently around binary and single stars .",
    "however , this parameter space is where planet formation is most likely inhibited around binaries due to the excitation of the disk and planetesimal eccentricities close to the stars .",
    "if planet formation around binaries is very efficient , circumbinary systems might be responsible for a population of free floating planets .",
    "thus , while dynamical evolution may not hold the key to creating intrinsic differences in circumbinary and single star planetary systems , it may provide the crucial observational evidence we need to understand these differences .",
