    "the concept of weak value , along with its experimental validation by weak measurements , has been around for almost quarter century @xcite .",
    "it is based on the idea of physical value subjected to two successive measurements @xcite , which has been later extended to general multiple - time measurements @xcite .",
    "the weak value formalism has a wide range of applications in various fields of quantum information theory .",
    "particularly , it can be used to transfer quantum - communication protocols @xcite , describe entangled systems @xcite , reconstruct quantum optical states by weak measurements @xcite and clone quantum systems @xcite . to many physicists minds , however , the concept still entails an aura of mystery , and confusion over its physical interpretations @xcite never seems to have been fully cleared .    in this article , we intend to reconcile this often mystified concept of weak value with the conventional orthogonal vector space formulation of quantum mechanics by introducing a _",
    "complete set _ of weak values .",
    "we point out the existence of a set of operators defined by biorthogonal hilbert vector bases , with which any hermitian operator can be expanded , upon which the weak values emerge as the expansion coefficients .",
    "one particular weak value can dominate over all others when certain conditions are met , presenting the phenomenon of `` magnification of physical value '' with weak measurement .",
    "we illustrate our argument with the examples of spin one - half and spin one systems .",
    "virtue of bringing in the whole set of weak values , as opposed to one particular weak value , is demonstrated by another example , again involving spin one - half and spin one systems , in which a mixed quantum state undergoes a projective measurement that brings the system into another mixed state .",
    "this process is shown to be easily described by an unistochastic matrix , a `` quantum '' subset of stochastic matrices @xcite .",
    "we identify the condition in which the unistochastic matrix is irreversible for the case of a spin one - half and spin one systems .",
    "we obtain the subset of all possible projective measurements , for which the history is erased , namely , the reconstruction of the original state is impossible after the measurement .",
    "consider a hermitian operator @xmath0 on hilbert space of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "we attempt to represent @xmath0 with two different orthonormal bases @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that we have the property @xmath6 .",
    "following aharonov , albert and vaidman @xcite , let us define the weak value @xmath7 of @xmath0 by @xmath8 we also define , in the manner of reznik and aharonov @xcite , the @xmath9 operator by @xmath10 which is a biorthogonal basis extension of the density matrix operator .",
    "we also define the overlap matrices @xmath11 we have , with straightforward calculation , a unique expansion of the operator @xmath0 in terms of @xmath12 set of operators @xmath13 ; @xmath14 note the relation @xmath15 which leads to the orthogonality relation @xmath16 from this , we easily have the formula to obtain the weak value of @xmath0 with @xmath17 operators using the trace ; @xmath18   = { \\rm tr } [ { w}_{\\ell , j } { a }   ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we conclude that the set of @xmath12 weak values @xmath19 @xmath20 characterizes the operator @xmath0 completely .",
    "we can also consider two mixed states @xmath21 for which , the @xmath9 operator is given by @xmath22 we obtain the mixed state weak value of a hermitian operator @xmath23 from this @xmath9 operator as @xmath24 = \\sum_{\\ell , j } q_\\ell p_j    ( a)_{\\ell , j } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this relation shows how the relative phases of weak values of different post and preselection states are to be experimentally determined .",
    "the weak value expansion is , technically , just a simple modification of standard expansion of a hermitian operator @xmath0 with orthonormal states @xmath25 @xmath26 using two sets of orthogonal states @xmath27 instead of one set . as such , the validity of weak values as a set of observable quantities which all together form a full description of the operator @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ wkexp ] ) , is quite independent from various `` interpretations '' of the weak value , that has ranged from practical to metaphysical .",
    "an important property of the weak value expansion is that all quantities appearing in ( [ wkexp ] ) are `` gauge invariant '' in the sense of invariance with respect to the change of phases of orthonormal vectors , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this contrasts with the traditional treatment of non diagonal matrix elements of hermitian operator @xmath30 whose gauge dependence renders them unsuitable for direct measurements , and the transition probabilities are related only with their absolute squares .",
    "the special feature of the weak value expansion is the fact that the weak value @xmath19 takes the eigenvalue of @xmath31 when @xmath0 is diagonal in the basis @xmath25 , and the eigenvalue of @xmath32 when @xmath0 is diagonal in the basis @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath34 and @xmath33 are identified as the states of a system at certain two times @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and if @xmath0 is some `` moderate mixture '' of two operators , which are respectively diagonal in @xmath34 and @xmath33 , it may therefore be possible to interpret the weak value @xmath19 as the `` physical value '' of the operator @xmath0 at any time in between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "but of course , the validity of such interpretation is quickly lost when such condition is not met .",
    "a useful expression @xmath37 is obtained from ( [ wkexp ] ) straightforwardly . since @xmath38 is the probability of finding the state @xmath32 in the state @xmath39 ,",
    "the weak value @xmath40 is interpretable as @xmath41-th factional component of the expectation value @xmath42 in terms of post - selection states .",
    "similarly , we also obtain @xmath43 with analogous interpretation as @xmath44-th factional component of the expectation value @xmath42 in terms of pre - selection states .",
    "an example of pauli spin operators with a set @xmath45 @xmath46 , @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath45 @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath48 , namely @xmath51 should be instructive .",
    "we have , for all @xmath41 , @xmath44 , @xmath52 an explicit matrix representation of @xmath17 operators are @xmath53 the weak values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 which is easily understood in terms of post - selection @xmath58 and pre - selection @xmath59 . if we consider the `` intermediate '' spin operator @xmath60 its weak values are given by @xmath61 which smoothly interpolates @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "still , they can attain the maximum value @xmath64 going beyond the classically allowed value of 1 .",
    "the weak values of @xmath65 are @xmath66 whose imaginariness and counter intuitive sign assignments are the signature of quantum incompatibility of the measurement of @xmath65 with both post- and pre - selection basis .",
    "the expansions of @xmath67 matrices in terms of @xmath9 operators are given by @xmath68 which are , in a sense , a trivial , but an instructive relations .",
    "alternative choice for the post - selection states @xmath69 with the same pre - selection states as before @xmath70 is also revealing . in this case , for the weight matrix , we have @xmath71 the @xmath9-matrix is given by @xmath72 note that some of the elements diverge at @xmath73 .",
    "they are to be compensated by the weight function to give finite answer to all physical quantities .",
    "the weak values of pauli matrix @xmath55 are given by @xmath74 which are easily understood because the pre - selection states @xmath75 are the eigenstates of this operator .",
    "for @xmath54 , we have the weak values @xmath76 some of which diverge at @xmath73 , indicating the existence of the weak measurement amplification .",
    "the meaning of this amplification is understood by calculating the weak values of rotated spin operator @xmath77 which is given by @xmath78 which simply reflects the fact that the post - selection states @xmath79 are the eigenstates of @xmath80 operator .",
    "the relation @xmath81 tells the source of divergence of @xmath63 with this choice of post selection states at @xmath73 .",
    "the weak values of @xmath65 are @xmath82 the expansions of @xmath67 matrices in terms of @xmath9 operators now are given by @xmath83 which clearly show the nature of weak value expansion .",
    "we now take a look at the example of a three - state hilbert space .",
    "consider the operators @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 defined by the algebra @xmath87 let us take an explicit representation @xmath88 we take the pre - selection states as @xmath89 and the post - selection states as @xmath90 which are obtained from @xmath31 by rotation around @xmath91-axis by angle @xmath92 .",
    "namely , they are the eigenstates of the operator @xmath93 defined @xmath94 with eigenvalues @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , respectively . in an analogous manner to the previous example of spin one - half , we can consider the complete set of weak values of arbitrary operator on the hilbert space using the pre - selection states @xmath31 and post - selection states @xmath32 .",
    "we first calculate the weight matrix , which is given by @xmath98 the @xmath9-matrix is given by    @xmath99    as in the case of spin one - half , some of the elements diverge at @xmath73 .",
    "novel feature here is the divergence at @xmath100 for the elements of @xmath101 .",
    "they are to be compensated by the weight function to give finite answer to all physical quantities .",
    "the weak values of the operator @xmath86 are given by @xmath102 which are easily understood because the pre - selection states @xmath75 are the eigenstates of this operator .",
    "for @xmath84 we have the weak values @xmath103 some of which diverge at @xmath73 .",
    "the weak values of rotated spin operator @xmath93 is naturally given by @xmath104 the divergence of @xmath84 at @xmath73 is understood from the relation @xmath105 the weak values of @xmath85 are @xmath106 thus , we find a very analogous structure of weak values to the one in the case of spin one - half : the divergence of `` non - diagonal '' weak values of angular momentum operators at @xmath73 .",
    "the nontrivial divergence of @xmath107 at @xmath100 is a novel feature of spin one system .",
    "the fact that the behaviors found in @xmath108 is generic for all hermitian operators in three - dimensional hilbert space , can be checked by calculating the weak values of all gell - mann matrices , with which ( plus unit matrix ) arbitrary hermitian operators is uniquely decomposed .",
    "suppose alice passes on a mixed state @xmath109 to bob , on which bob performs a projective measurement using the basis @xmath110 and obtain the mixed state @xmath111 let us ask how bob can reconstruct the state @xmath112 with the knowledge that alice had obtained her state from a projective measurement in the basis @xmath113 .",
    "if the alice s state is expressed in the basis @xmath114 , a generic representation with non - diagonal elements should be obtained , namely @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "after the projective measurement , only diagonal components of this expression remain , and we should have @xmath117 . if we consider the _ weak value of @xmath112 _ between states @xmath118 and @xmath31 , then obtain @xmath119 for any @xmath120 , since @xmath121 , thus giving the formal answer to our question in terms of the weak values . in order to obtain the explicit expression of @xmath122 in terms of @xmath123 ,",
    "we rewrite this equation , by inserting the complete set @xmath124 in front of @xmath112 in the lhs , in the form @xmath125 which can be reformulated as @xmath126 linear equations indexed by @xmath127 ; @xmath128 for @xmath126 unknown variables @xmath129 with @xmath130 clearly , this gives the solution to the problem of state reconstruction .",
    "we can further multiply @xmath131 to the above equation from the right and sum up by @xmath44 to obtain @xmath132 which splits into @xmath133 which are the explicit forms of linear equations that enable us to obtain @xmath122 and then @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) from @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "an illustrative example is in order .",
    "consider consecutive measurements of a spin one - half system by alice and bob .",
    "we assume alice s basis is given by @xmath137 and bob s one by @xmath138 with the parameter range @xmath139 .",
    "alice s state @xmath140 is projected to @xmath141 by bob s measurement .",
    "suppose that bob wants to reconstruct the alice s state @xmath112 from his state @xmath142 with the knowledge of the basis sets @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",

    "we consider the generalization of this results to the system with higher dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the reconstruction of alice s state by the results of bob s measurement in the case of arbitrary spin can be performed , in principle , in the same manner with eq .",
    "( [ reconstruction ] ) , but in reality , the task is nontrivial . we need to characterize all permissible matrices with positive matrix elements @xmath150 , which make valid our computations and allow us to solve the system of equations ( [ reconstruction ] ) .",
    "first of all we have a condition @xmath151 the matrices , which are satisfied to such conditions , are called bistochastic or doubly stochastic .",
    "the class of @xmath152 bistochastic matrices is a @xmath153 dimensional compact convex polyhedron known as the birkhoff s polytope @xmath154 @xcite .",
