    "since atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors cause fluctuations in the intensity of the received signal , the photon - counting free space optical ( fso ) system with intensity modulation requires the channel state information(csi ) , i.e. , the instantaneous value of the channel gain @xmath0 , to adjust the detection threshold .",
    "for such a system , the received signal @xmath1 in each symbol interval is a discrete poisson random variable with mean @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the effective count parameters due to the transmitted signal and the background radiation , respectively @xcite .",
    "notation @xmath5 is used to denote the transmitted data bit , which takes on either the value `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' with equal probability .",
    "since the time scale of the channel fading processes are of the order of @xmath6-@xmath7s , which are far larger than the symbol interval ( @xmath8 for multi - gbps systems ) , the channel gain @xmath0 can be regarded as a constant over a large number of symbol intervals and we define this number as the channel coherence length , denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "thus , at time @xmath10 , the data subsequence with length @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath12 , suffers from the same level fading if @xmath13 .",
    "the authors of @xcite suggested a generalised maximum likelihood sequence detection ( gmlsd ) receiver , whose structure is @xmath14 in , the decision metric is @xmath15^{r_\\mathrm{on } }    \\exp[-r_\\mathrm{on } + n_bn_\\mathrm{on } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are functions of @xmath18 and are defined as @xmath19 evidently , the decision metric of this gmlsd receiver given in avoids the calculation of complex integrals and thus can be evaluated efficiently .",
    "moreover , this decision metric is based solely on the observed values of received subsequences .",
    "no more channel model information is required and this makes it practically implementable . as discussed in @xcite , since it can simultaneously estimate the channel and detects the data sequence , it can approach the genie bound , which is defined as the bit error probability ( bep ) of the ideal receiver given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 9 ) ) , with a large observation window size .    as introduced in @xcite , the multiple - symbol detection ( msd ) algorithm proposed in @xcite is adopted to implement the sequence receiver .",
    "the msd algorithm employs a block - by - block detection scheme , and the search complexity is @xmath20 . in general , a higher @xmath11 is preferred since it can help the receiver to achieve a better performance .",
    "however , if @xmath11 increases , the search complexity increases and also a large delay is introduced .",
    "in addition , an error floor problem is observed affecting the receiver performance . in the next section ,",
    "we propose our robust and efficient implementation method of this gmlsd receiver .",
    "similar to @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : glrt_trellis ] , there are 2 nodes at each time point in the trellis diagram .",
    "we label each node using values assumed by the data `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' . for any paths , entering the same node represents the transmission of the symbol corresponding to that node . at this point",
    ", we evaluate the decision metric of a branch with only its corresponding @xmath11 most recent symbol vector @xmath21 and the @xmath11 most recent received signals @xmath22 .",
    "any two paths entering the same node are compared in terms of their metric value and the one with a lower metric value is discarded . in this way , the path with the largest metric is saved as the survivor . the decision on a bit",
    "is made only when the tails of all survivors have merged at the corresponding node .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : glrt_trellis ] , two paths , @xmath23 and @xmath24 merge at time @xmath25 .",
    "accordingly , all the decisions before time @xmath25 are made .",
    "the entire trellis - search algorithm works in the same way as the viterbi algorithm .",
    "clearly , since for each time point @xmath10 , only four possible decision metrics need to be evaluated and two of them with smaller metric values are discarded , the overall search complexity of our viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm is small and is independent of the observation window length .",
    "an error floor problem is observed in @xcite .",
    "this is because when a block incurs all zero symbols , the denominator of the decision metric becomes zero since @xmath17 is zero . in our work",
    ", we adopt a selective - store strategy to overcome this problem . in advance , we define the received signal @xmath1 , which is detected to carry symbol 0 , as the 0-detected signal ; and similarly , the one that is detected to carry symbol 1 is defined as the 1-detected signal .",
    "we can see that each of the two survivors showed in fig .",
    "[ fg : glrt_trellis ] can be divided into two parts : the detected part and the ongoing part .",
    "for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : glrt_trellis ] , the detected part is the one before ( including ) time @xmath25 ; and the ongoing part is the one after time @xmath25 .",
    "as we can see from that the 0-detected signals are not contributing to the decision metric , for the detected part , we need only store the most recent @xmath26 1-detected signals , where @xmath26 is used to denote the memory length .",
    "we define a memory array @xmath27 with length @xmath26 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : memory_gmlsd_seq ] , to store the most recent @xmath26 1-detected signals . in this way , with this selective - store strategy , the receiver has sufficient information for estimating the unknown channel .",
    "in addition , we need two more memory arrays to store the ongoing parts of the two survivors and one more array to store the ongoing received subsequence . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : memory_gmlsd_seq ] , we define them as @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 with length @xmath31 .",
    "we use @xmath32 to denote the real length of the detected part that contains exactly @xmath26 1-detected signals and @xmath33 to denote the length of the ongoing part .",
    "apparently , the total subsequence length is @xmath34 and is a random variable since @xmath32 and @xmath33 are both random due to the transmit data uncertainty . from simulation observations ,",
    "the average value of @xmath33 is no larger than 2 , thus @xmath11 is of the order of @xmath35 .",
    "we have to choose an appropriate @xmath26 value to ensure @xmath13 .",
    "also , to ensure @xmath36 , we set @xmath37 . using this selective - store strategy ,",
    "we selectively store the the most recent 1-detected signals , we thus prevent the denominator of the decision metric being zero , and consequently overcome the error floor completely .",
    "besides , the delay of the system using our algorithm depends on the value of @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath33 is always very small , the system delay is very small ( generally less than 2 bits ) and is independent of @xmath26 , or @xmath11 .",
    "we plot fig . [ fg : compare_fig1 ] corresponding to ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "1 ) , fig .",
    "[ fg : compare_fig2 ] corresponding to ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) . both the channel models and model parameters adopted for fig .",
    "[ fg : compare_fig1 ] are the same as that for ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig . 1 ) and that for [ fg : compare_fig2 ] are the same as that for ( * ? ? ?",
    "the definition of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) used in this paper is the same as that in @xcite and is given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 7 ) ) ; and the definition of scintillation index ( s.i . ) used here is given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 1 ) ) .",
    "we do not re - implement the gmlsd receiver using the msd algorithm , and when re - plotting curves in @xcite for comparison , we precisely read ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.s 1 and 2 ) by adobe illustrator to obtain the data values ( bep versus snr ) . for systems using the msd algorithm ,",
    "@xmath11 is used to denote the block length and for systems using our algorithm , @xmath26 is used to denote the memory length .    clearly , we can see that with @xmath38 , the performance of our implementation is very close to the genie bound .",
    "it outperforms the gmlsd receiver using msd algorithm with @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 and it is even better than the mlsd receiver ( with @xmath39 ) proposed in @xcite which requires the channel model information . though the difference between the performance of our implementation method and the genie bound can be observed .",
    "we are achieving the genie bound by increasing the value of @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath26 increases to 8 , the performance of our implementation has perfectly achieved the genie bound . for the gmlsd receiver implemented by the msd algorithm , to achieve the genie bound at larger - than-@xmath42 region , @xmath11 is required to be no smaller than 50 .",
    "more importantly , from fig .",
    "[ fg : compare ] , no error floor has been observed even with @xmath43 .",
    "in this paper , we investigate implementation methods of the gmlsd sequence receiver for the fso photon - counting communication system .",
    "we propose a viterbi - type trellis - search algorithm to improve the search efficiency , and a selective - store strategy to overcome the error floor problem as well as to increase the memory efficiency .",
    "using simulations , we have shown the performance of our implementation method outperforms that with the msd algorithm and can approach the genie bound with a relatively small observation window size .",
    "additionally , adopting our method can help completely avoid the error floor problem .",
