    "the study of solitons and non - topological solitons ( ntss ) has a rich history . they have been proposed as building blocks for stars and black holes @xcite , and as dark matter candidates @xcite .",
    "the first models for an nts in 3 + 1 dimensions were found by lee and wick , and by friedberg , lee and sirlin @xcite .",
    "the latter nts contained one real scalar field to set up a false vacuum in which a second , complex scalar field was massless , allowing the nts to be the lowest energy state for the system under certain conditions .",
    "coleman and collaborators extended this work to simpler objects dubbed @xmath0-balls , which contained a single complex scalar field that possessed a conserved global symmetry @xcite .",
    "more recent work has extended ntss to contain fermions @xcite and gauge fields @xcite . finally , work has been done by kusenko extending ntss to some supersymmetric field theories , where the corresponding false vacuum is set up in the superpotential @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a new model for an nts containing mutually interacting fermions , scalar particles , and a @xmath1 gauge field .",
    "the fermions have a yukawa coupling to the scalars , and both carry a conserved global charge .",
    "this model is thus closer to more realistic theories of particle physics that fit in or are inspired by extensions of the standard model .",
    "we note that recently a fermionic q - ball model was proposed by anagnostopoulos et al .",
    "however , the approach adopted in the present manuscript is quite different , as we explicitly solve the dirac equation , as opposed to modeling the fermions as a relativistic gas from the outset , and include the yukawa coupling to the scalar field .",
    "our results , nevertheless , agree with the general conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , as we show that , indeed , it is possible to obtain ntss which are the lowest energy state in the system for a wide range of parameters .",
    "in addition , there is an opportunity to extend our work to bring it in line with the nuclear bag model , as the expression derived below for the energy approximates some models used in nuclear physics . throughout",
    "we work in natural units where @xmath2 .",
    "consider the lagrangian    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the complex scalar field , @xmath5 is the @xmath1 covariant derivative , @xmath6 is the field tensor , and @xmath7 is the potential for the scalar field .",
    "@xmath8 is the 4-component spinor , @xmath9 is the dirac adjoint spinor , @xmath10 are the four covariant dirac matrices , @xmath11 is a positive constant , and @xmath12 is a constant chosen such that when @xmath13 the fermions are massless within the nts . we can express the complex scalar field as two real fields using @xmath14 , to get @xmath15 we assume the ground state will be spherically symmetric , and will have no magnetic field and hence no electric currents .",
    "therefore , we may choose a gauge where @xmath16 .",
    "the boundary condition is that @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we make the assumption that the scalar field oscillates in time with a regular frequency and hence @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a positive constant @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian then becomes @xmath21 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath8 are @xmath25 = 0 , \\ ] ] @xmath26 @xmath27 where it is understood that the only non - vanishing component of @xmath28 is @xmath29 .",
    "the conserved currents and charges are given by @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33",
    "to proceed , we could take one of two approaches .",
    "we could use the fermi gas approach as in @xcite .",
    "or we could attempt to solve the equations of motion directly .",
    "we attempt the second method here .",
    "we begin with the dirac equation for the fermion field .",
    "we can write @xmath8 in terms of two , 2-component , spin-@xmath34 spinors in the chiral representation as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a right ( left)-handed spinor .",
    "it is easier to proceed if we switch to the non - covariant representation of the dirac equation .",
    "multiplying by @xmath37 on the left and using that @xmath38 , we get the equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the potential for the fermions , and @xmath41 is the mass of the fermion .",
    "following lee et al .",
    "we will assume that @xmath42 inside the nts @xcite .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath8 is of the simple form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the energy of a single fermion .",
    "we therefore get the new equation @xmath45 we desire @xmath8 to be spherically symmetric in the ground state . since @xmath46 and @xmath47 must have opposite parity under spatial reflection , they can not both be symmetric . therefore , we must choose one of them to equal zero , and conventions of a right - handed coordinate system dictate that it is the left handed component that must be zero",
    ". we can now expand in terms of an angular part and a radial part by writing @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a spherical spinor and the indices @xmath50 are the quantum numbers of total angular momentum , orbital angular momentum , and the @xmath51-component of angular momentum , respectively .",
    "in the spherically - symmetric ground state we have @xmath52 and so @xmath53 , and the spherical spinor for this case simplifies to @xcite @xmath54 and we see that indeed our wave - function is spherically symmetric .",
    "the equations for @xmath55 become @xcite @xmath56 @xmath57 h = 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath58 so here @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ h equation 1 ] ) is then simply @xmath60 .",
    "however , we notice a problem with eq .",
    "( [ h equation 2 ] ) ; namely , if @xmath61 is non - constant then it demands that @xmath62 since @xmath44 must be a constant , and the equation must be sastified for all @xmath63 .",
    "how are we to get around this problem ?",
    "we can approximate the fermionic energy inside the nts as constant by taking the expectation value of the fermionic potential inside it",
    ". then we can write @xmath64 and eq .",
    "( [ h equation 2 ] ) may be approximately satisfied inside the nts . before doing this we note that if @xmath65 is constant , the expression for the conserved charge eq .",
    "( [ my conserved n ] ) becomes simply @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the radius of the ball .",
    "we then get that @xmath68 dr , \\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the third pauli spin matrix , and our approximate solution is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the step function .",
    "we can now use eq .",
    "( [ final solution to dirac equation ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ my g equation ] ) .",

    "we can now substitute for @xmath74 in eq .",

    ", we get @xmath76 -   \\frac{e^2 n \\tanh(x)}{4 \\pi r ( x -\\tanh(x))},\\ ] ] where @xmath77 .",
    "the gauge invariant energy can be written as @xmath78 + e_f~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the relativistic fermi energy given by @xmath80 .",
    "ignoring surface terms @xmath81 , performing some partial integrations , and using our solution for @xmath8 we get , for @xmath82 , @xmath83 we can use eq .",
    "( [ omega q equation ] ) to get @xmath84 +   \\frac{4}{3 } \\pi r^3 u(f ) + \\\\ \\nonumber   + \\frac{c_1 n^{4/3}}{r } - \\frac{e^2 q n}{8 \\pi r } \\biggl [ \\frac{\\tanh x } { x - \\tanh x}\\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 .",
    "the next step is to minimize this expression with respect to the various parameters at fixed @xmath86 and @xmath0 .",
    "we examine the case of small @xmath87 and expand to order @xmath88 , where the laurent series are given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we then get an approximate form for @xmath44 to @xmath91 of @xmath92 these terms now have an easy physical interpretation .",
    "the first term is the zero - point energy of the scalar particles .",
    "the second term is the vacuum volume energy of the bag .",
    "the third term is the fermi energy .",
    "the fourth term is the coulomb repulsion of the scalar particles .",
    "the fifth and six terms represent the interactions of the fermions with the scalars and gauge fields , which may significantly alter the nts s energy .",
    "if we minimize this expression with respect to @xmath67 we obtain , writing @xmath93 , @xmath94 the formal solution to this equation is given by @xmath95 , \\\\",
    "n=0 , \\pm 1 , \\pm 2 \\ldots \\nonumber \\\\   z \\equiv y/ \\alpha , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\alpha \\equiv \\sqrt { ( 4 a /3 ) } , \\nonumber",

    "hence , it is not possible to write down a general procedure for selecting a root .",
    "once a suitable potential has been chosen however , the solution follows in a straightforward manner . to illustrate this , we solve for the potential @xmath98 we choose @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ( we must choose @xmath104 to insure that @xmath105 for all @xmath106 ) , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 have dimensions of mass ( @xmath108 is the mass of the fermions in the true vacuum ) . the energy scale is set by @xmath96 , which has dimensions of mass .",
    "we first solve the problem with no fermions present , which is identical to the scenario considered in @xcite .",
    "this gives us an idea of a possible range of values for @xmath67 and @xmath96 ( based on this analysis , we set @xmath109 throughout ) to search for fermionic ntss .",
    "writing the energy of the free scalars and fermions as @xmath110 , the nts is stable whenever @xmath111 . in fig .",
    "[ en_n ] , we show the ratio @xmath112 as a function of increasing fermion number , for several values of the radius . from a more detailed analysis",
    "we can show that , for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ en_n ] , the condition for the existence of ntss is satisfied for @xmath113 .",
    "clearly , the same sort of range search can be performed for any set of paramenters .      in fig .",
    "[ en_r ] we show the ratio @xmath114 as a function of the nts radius for different values of the fermionic charge @xmath86 .",
    "clearly , there is a wide range of values for @xmath86 wherein the nts is the preferred energy configuration . for large radii ( larger than the range of values displayed in the figure ) ,",
    "the nts energy is independent of @xmath86 , as can be easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ my series expanded energy ] ) .",
    "we conclude with a few remarks about our nts .",
    "first , we see that if we use a potential that satisfies coleman s condition @xcite @xmath115 < \\mu ^2 $ ] ( @xmath107 is the mass of the free scalar particles ) , in order to set up a false vacuum where the fermions can be massless , then we can always find parameters where @xmath116 .",
    "second , we see that the presence of both fermions and the gauge field increases the energy and the radius of the nts , while the attractive yukawa coupling between the fermions and scalars decreases both in relation to the ungauged scalar @xmath0-balls studied by coleman and collaborators @xcite .",
    "third , we note that the asymptotic form of the energy is @xmath117 hence , if we scale @xmath97 in such a way that @xmath118 , our nts can be stable at arbitrarily large radii .",
    "physically , we have obtained a state of matter with scalar particles and fermions uniform throughout .",
    "we thus see that it is possible to form a nts out of gauged fermions and scalar particles , which can be the preferred energy state of the system for a wide range of parameters",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the solutions to the set of coupled equations numerically , obtaining a more detailed analysis of the allowed parameter space .",
