    "atmospheric general circulation models ( gcms ) exhibit persistent biases in their representation of the circulation at a quantitative level . among such biases are the too equatorward location of the eddy - driven jet in both hemispheres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and the exaggeration of the intertropical convergence zone ( itcz ) split over the eastern pacific ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , climate models exhibit a wide range of predicted changes in these circulation patterns under global warming ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "uncertainties in parameterized processes are thought to be in part responsible for the persistent model biases and the divergence in model projections . while the cloud and convection parameterizations have thus far received the most attention ,",
    "the surface processes remain comparatively unexplored .",
    "the interaction of the surface layer with an overlying atmosphere is an important process governing the atmospheric circulation .",
    "eddy momentum fluxes maintain the eddy - driven jet against surface friction .",
    "latent and sensible heat fluxes supply energy to the overlying atmosphere and thereby influence the thermally direct hadley circulation ( hc ) and the associated itcz .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to accurately represent the surface - atmosphere interaction in any gcm .    due to the insufficient spatial and temporal resolutions in gcms , the explicit representation of the turbulent surface fluxes is not possible .",
    "hence , the surface fluxes must be parameterized . in state - of - the - art",
    "gcms , the turbulent fluxes are treated with a bulk exchange formulation based on the monin - obukhov similarity theory ( mo ) . because many parameters underlying mo are empirically determined , uncertainties exist in the surface flux parameterizations .",
    "one such class of empirically determined parameters is surface exchange coefficients and , in particular , roughness lengths . exploring the circulation sensitivity to uncertainties in the roughness length for momentum",
    "is the objective of this study .",
    "the view that a uniform surface layer ( i.e. , in the absence of orography ) is passive and determined by the eddy momentum fluxes in the atmosphere has been challenged by several recent studies , which suggest that the representation of the surface layer can have a direct impact on the momentum budget and the extra - tropical circulation .",
    "@xcite showed that the latitude of the eddy - driven jet shifts poleward in response to decrease in surface friction in an idealized dry gcm , in a setup similar to @xcite . in that setup",
    "the surface friction is parameterized as a linear relaxation of near - surface winds to zero on a specified time scale ( i.e. the rayleigh drag ) and such a parameterization has a direct effect on the momentum budget only .",
    "however , unrealistically large perturbations to the surface friction are required to produce significant jet shifts . moreover , the dry @xcite setup is limited in its representation of the tropics and hence the effect of reduced surface friction on the tropical circulation remains to be quantified . using a full - complexity gcm",
    ", @xcite found that increasing surface roughness for momentum at the air - sea interface for moderate flow speed ( 4 - 20ms@xmath2 ) in nasa s goddard earth observing system chemistry - climate model ( geos-5 ) improved the southern hemisphere stratospheric circulation together with surface winds and eddy momentum flux convergence aloft over the southern ocean .",
    "details in the surface latent and sensible heat flux parameterization are also known to affect the tropical circulation .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that increasing latent and sensible heat fluxes at low flow speed ( < 5ms@xmath2 ) in the ecmwf global forecast model resulted in improvement of seasonal rainfall distributions , the indian monsoon circulation , and systematic tropical model biases .",
    "@xcite found that the combined structure of the hc and the itcz is strongly influenced by the distribution of the latent heat fluxes in an aquaplanet gcm forced by zonally- and hemispherically - symmetric sst distributions with a maximum at the equator .",
    "in particular , he showed that despite the equatorial maximum in sst , a local evaporation minimum can form at the equator and generate a double itcz .",
    "this minimum came about from the near - surface flow speed dependency of the latent heat flux parameterization ( see equation  ( [ bulks ] ) ) . if , however , the flow dependency was removed from the parameterization a single itcz formed at the equator , at the sst maximum .",
    "similar to @xcite , the present study explores the sensitivity of the large - scale circulation to changes in air - sea momentum roughness ( henceforth @xmath0 ) within the limits of the observational constraints .",
    "different from @xcite , @xmath0 is reduced at low flow speed in the community atmosphere model ( cam3 ) @xcite . because reducing @xmath0 affects both the surface stresses and the latent and sensible heat fluxes",
    ", the large - scale circulation can respond both to changes in the momentum budget  as in @xcite and @xcite  and to changes in the thermodynamic budget  as in @xcite and @xcite .    by performing a series of simulations with cam3 under aquaplanet @xcite and amip - type @xcite setups forced by prescribed ssts",

    "the setup excludes the seasonal cycle and the complexity and temporal variability of land , ocean and ice distribution , but contains the full complexity of the gcm parameterizations including the mo treatment of the surface layer .",
    "reducing @xmath0 at low flow speed reduces the latent and sensible heat fluxes in the tropics .",

    "figures  [ fig4 ]  and  [ fig5 ] show the zonal - mean circulation response from the first set of simulations . by comparing the two figures with figure[fig2 ] ,",
    "it is clear that the response  even in the mid - latitudes  is mediated from the tropics .",
    "this suggests the existence of a zonally - symmetric tropical - extratropical teleconnection , which is discussed in section  [ sec : resp ] .",
    "figures  [ fig6 ]  and  [ fig7 ] show the zonal - mean circulation response from the second set of simulations . by comparing the two figures with figure[fig2 ] ,",
    "it is clear that the total response is mostly thermodynamically mediated , i.e. , through reducing @xmath0 in @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "notably , the tropical circulation response to reducing @xmath0 in @xmath8 is opposite to the total response ; the hc upwelling region , the itcz , and the subtropical jet shift equatorward in this case .",
    "the equatorward shift of the itcz in response to reduction of @xmath8 is a result of the wind - evaporation feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the immediate response to reducing @xmath8 at low flow speed is to accelerate the tropical near - surface winds .",
    "because @xmath9 depends on the near - surface wind magnitude ( equation  [ bulks ] ) , the increase in the tropical surface winds leads to the enhanced @xmath9 there . as a result ,",
    "the hc strengthens ( maximum in @xmath57 at 500  hpa is @xmath598% stronger ) , the itcz shifts equatorward ( see section  [ sec : resp ] for explanation ) and the subtropical jet becomes stronger ( region of positive anomaly in the upper troposphere equatorward of 20@xmath75n in figure  [ fig7]@xmath55 ) .",
    "this is similar to the simulation in @xcite , in which the equatorial flow speed was artificially enhanced by setting @xmath76ms@xmath2 everywhere .",
    "however , the wind - evaporation feedback is weak in the simulations shown in figure  [ fig2 ] because any increase in wind from reducing @xmath0 in @xmath8 is compensated by the reduction of @xmath0 in the equation that prescribes @xmath9 .",
    "note that the itcz is displaced further poleward in the simulation where @xmath0 is reduced for @xmath9 and @xmath10 only ( cf . figure[fig2]@xmath63 with figure[fig6]@xmath63 ) .",
    "this suggests that the wind - evaporation feedback acts to partially counteract the poleward displacement of the itcz in the total response ( figure[fig2 ] ) .",
    "however , the full response is not linear to the reduction of @xmath0 in @xmath8 and in @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( i.e. , the sum of the responses in figures  [ fig6 ]  and  [ fig7 ] is not the same as the response in figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the mid - latitude westerlies shift poleward in response to reduced @xmath8 ( figure  [ fig7]@xmath55 ) .",
    "thus it is possible that the mechanism discussed in @xcite that relies on the increase in wave phase speeds and the resulting poleward shift of the critical latitude region is playing some role here .            [ !",
    "ht ]         given that @xmath0 is reduced at low flow speed only , it is perhaps not surprising that tropical @xmath9 and @xmath10 play a dominant role in the total response as the extratropical surface winds are directly only weakly affected .",
    "however , in simulations where @xmath0 is unrealistically uniformly reduced by a factor of 0.5 to affect all flow speeds , the response is nearly identical to that in figure  [ fig2 ] ( not shown ) .",
    "this suggests that the reduction of @xmath0 at low flow speed  and especially the effect of this reduction on @xmath9 and @xmath10is instrumental to the response .",
    "when @xmath0 is reduced by a factor of 0.5 in the bulk formulation for @xmath8 only , a stronger extratropical response than in figure  [ fig7 ] is produced ; the westerlies on the poleward flank of the mid - latitude jet strengthen and there is an accompanying increase in wave phase speed ( not shown ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath0 in @xmath8 ( but only in @xmath8 ) is substantially reduced at all flow speeds , the mechanism discussed in @xcite is likely to operate .",
    "however , different from @xcite , a strong tropical response is present in that case ; the hc strengthens and the itcz shifts equatorward as a result of the wind - evaporation feedback .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that in simulations forced by other sst profiles ( see figure  [ fig8new ] ) the tropical energy fluxes are also instrumental in the total response ( not shown ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is reduced , a potential null hypothesis would be that the surface winds would accelerate to maintain the same @xmath8 .",
    "the increase in surface winds would counteract the decrease in @xmath77 and @xmath78 leaving @xmath9 and @xmath10 unchanged ( see equation  ( [ bulks ] ) ) .",
    "however , the null hypothesis is clearly invalid in this study , where the reduction in tropical @xmath9 and @xmath10 is crucial in initiating the response .",
    "more importantly , the acceleration of meridional surface winds implied by the null hypothesis is inconsistent with ekman balance , because unchanged @xmath8 implies unchanged ekman pumping ( i.e. in a zonally - symmetric case and employing an equatorial @xmath79-plane approximation the ekman pumping @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the meridional wind in the ekman layer ) and hence unchanged meridional winds in the boundary layer .",
    "therefore , something else has to happen in the reduced @xmath0 simulations .    to examine how the circulation response is established ,",
    "a 50 ensemble member switch - on simulation is performed . in the simulation , the reduced @xmath0",
    "is suddenly switched on in the bulk formulation for all the fluxes at @xmath82days .",
    "each member is initialized from a random point in the equilibrated original @xmath0 simulation .",
    "figure[fig8 ] shows tropical zonal - mean distributions of fields , important for understanding the adjustment , at different stages after the switch - on .",
    "when the reduced @xmath0 is switched on , the surface meridional wind ( @xmath83 ) weakens initially in the tropics ( cf . solid line with thick line in panel @xmath55 ) as a result of the weaker ekman drag from @xmath84 that drives @xmath83 . the initial decrease in @xmath84 can be seen in figure[fig10new]@xmath55 ( cf . solid line with dashed line ) .",
    "the reduction in @xmath84 is evidently more important than the decrease in @xmath85 and in contrast , the initial response in surface zonal wind ( @xmath86 ) is a strengthening near the equator and at @xmath67n@xmath87n ( panel @xmath88 ) .",
    "hence , the initial response is a reduction in @xmath89 everywhere ( panel @xmath90 ) , because @xmath91 ( panel @xmath63 ) does not increase enough to compensate for the decrease in @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is the result of the weakening of @xmath83 just discussed .",
    "the inevitable consequence of reduced @xmath89 is to dry and cool the tropics .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig3 ] , where the cooling ( growing with altitude because of the drying ) spreads upward in the deep tropics and poleward in the tropical mid to upper troposphere .",
    "a cooler tropical mid to upper troposphere implies a weakened subtropical temperature gradient and thus a weakened equatorial flank of the subtropical jet ( panel @xmath92 , also figure[fig2]@xmath55)in analogy with the la ni@xmath1a phase of enso variability ( e.g. @xcite  and  @xcite ) . because the tropical meridional temperature gradient is weaker in the reduced @xmath0 simulation , the weaker jet follows from thermal wind balance .",
    "the hc mass flux is also weaker as a weaker hc can now maintain uniform temperatures in the tropics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus another way of understanding the weakened subtropical jet is weakened angular momentum transport by the hc",
    ".    a weakened equatorial flank of the subtropical jet implies a poleward shift of the critical latitudes in the subtropics .",
    "the critical latitude is the region where the wave phase speed @xmath63 closely matches the mean flow speed @xmath56 .",
    "it is the region where the rossby waves , generated by the near - surface baroclinic instability , break and deposit easterly momentum @xcite .",
    "the poleward shift in the critical latitude in response to reduction in @xmath0 can be seen in figure[fig12 ] , which shows the equilibrated eddy momentum flux convergence spectra as a function of angular phase speed ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath71 at 250hpa .",
    "the figure bears a marked resemblance to figure  9 in @xcite for the el ni@xmath1o minus la ni@xmath1a enso variability , taking into account the sign reversal . in particular , in the reduced @xmath0 simulation",
    "there is a systematic poleward shift of the critical latitude for waves of all @xmath94 and a poleward shift of the whole eddy momentum flux convergence spectrum , with a characteristic convergence - divergence - convergence tripole pattern in the response .",
    "it is clear that the weaker subtropical jet leads the poleward critical latitude shift , because an initial poleward shift of the critical latitudes would strengthen rather than weaken the winds on the equatorial flank of the jet ( because of less wave drag there ) .",
    "this poleward critical latitude shift explains the poleward shift in the hc terminus , and also acts to weaken the core of the jet .",
    "finally , the tropical cooling also reduces baroclinicity in the subtropical latitudes , reducing the baroclinic eddy generation as reflected in figure[fig13 ] , which shows the quasi - geostrophic ep flux diagnostics @xcite for the original @xmath0 climatology in ( @xmath55 ) and the response in ( @xmath88 ) . in the original @xmath0 simulation the ep flux , which represents wave activity propagation , resembles the classic scenario with upward wave propagation in the lower and middle troposphere and mostly equatorward wave propagation aloft .",
    "the response in ( @xmath88 ) shows a reduced ep flux convergence in mid - latitudes ( the red patch in figure  [ fig13]@xmath88 ) , and thus less deceleration , which accounts for the strengthened poleward flank of the subtropical jet .",
    "together with the critical latitude shift discussed above , this explains the tripole eddy momentum flux convergence pattern and the poleward jet shift .    to further support the mechanistic chain of events just discussed and to determine the timescales involved in the adjustment , it is instructive to examine how the ekman and zonal momentum . ]",
    "balances are restored following the switch - on .",
    "figure[fig10new ] shows the adjustment of ekman and momentum balance terms to their reduced @xmath0 equilibrium counterparts at 7@xmath75n ( panel @xmath88 ) and at 50@xmath75n ( panel @xmath63 ) . in order to more easily interpret the responses in panels ( @xmath88 ) and ( @xmath63 )",

    "the eddy momentum flux cospectrum is calculated following @xcite and @xcite before taking the divergence.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]            after the switch - on , @xmath84 and @xmath96 track each other extremely closely ( cf . dotted line with dash dotted line in panels ( @xmath88 ) and ( @xmath63 ) ) , showing that ekman balance is restored almost instantly and holds throughout the adjustment process .",
    "while the tropical momentum flux convergence ( mfc ) also follows @xmath84 relatively closely , there is a slight imbalance that reflects the lack of equilibrium ( cf . solid line with dotted line ) .",
    "the tropical mfc adjustment is mainly occurring through the mean mfc term ( thick line ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the weakened subtropical temperature gradient effected by reduced @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast , the tropical eddy mfc ( dotted line ) only starts to respond @xmath59  15days after the switch - on .",
    "this shows that the eddy changes respond to the mean flow changes , rather than vice - versa . in the extratropics ,",
    "the mfc and @xmath84 only start to respond @xmath59  30 days after the switch - on ( panel @xmath63 ) . in summary",
    ", the upper tropospheric eddy mfc in the subtropics responds to the mean changes in the tropics and the extratropical changes ( reflecting changes in baroclinic generation ) occur later .",
    "it is important to understand that the mechanism behind the poleward midlatitude jet shift proposed in this study is initiated by the tropical mean flow changes .",
    "in contrast , the mechanism behind the poleward jet shift in @xcite in response to reduced rayleigh drag is initiated by the extratropical mfc changes .      the arguments in section  [ sec : resp ]",
    "explain the hc weakening and the poleward shift of the mid - latitude westerlies and the subtropical descent region .",
    "however , the poleward shift of the itcz in these simulations remains to still be elucidated .",
    "the moist static energy budget provides a useful framework for understanding the poleward itcz shift .",
    "neglecting a relatively small contribution from the atmospheric kinetic energy , the vertically - integrated , zonal - mean moist static energy budget in a steady state is @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes a mass - weighted vertical integral over the atmospheric columns ; @xmath102 denotes zonal and temporal mean ; @xmath103 is the moist static energy , where @xmath104 is the geopotential height , @xmath105 is the latent heat of vaporization , and @xmath106 is the net radiative flux .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for the derivation of equation  ( [ mse ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ mse ] ) states that the divergence of the moist static energy flux @xmath107 is balanced by the net moist static energy input to the atmosphere @xmath108 .",
    "as long as the gross moist stability is positive , @xmath109 has the same sign as the mass flux in the upper branch of the hc ( see e.g. , discussion in @xcite in their appendix 2 ) .",
    "therefore , the principal quantity controlling the position of the hc is the net supply of moist static energy , which is a small difference between the net supply by latent and sensible heat fluxes @xmath110 and the energy loss by radiative cooling @xmath111 . in particular ,",
    "a small fractional change in @xmath112 and @xmath10 can cause a large change in the energy balance of the hc .    as long as the latitude where @xmath69 changes sign does not vary strongly with height ( as in the hemispherically symmetric simulations in this study ) , the hc upwelling region and the itcz are located at the latitude where @xmath113  i.e. , at the `` energy flux equator '' @xcite . to understand the itcz shift it is instructive to examine the evolution of @xmath114 and @xmath115 during the adjustment in figures[fig8]@xmath68  and  [ fig8]@xmath116",
    ". note that @xmath117 is the latitudinal integral of @xmath118 , and @xmath119 at the equator in the hemispherically - symmetric case discussed here .",
    "the initial reduction in @xmath89 reduces @xmath114 in the tropics ( cf . solid line with thick and dotted lines in panel @xmath68 ) and thus increases the latitude at which @xmath120 passes through zero ( panel @xmath116 ) .",
    "thus the itcz is predicted to shift poleward . as the itcz shifts poleward , the surface easterlies and the latitude where @xmath83 changes sign are pushed poleward to maintain ekman balance .",
    "this leads to a decrease in @xmath121 on either side of the equator ( figure  [ fig8]@xmath63 ) and a concomitant decrease in @xmath122 there ( figure  [ fig8]@xmath90 ) .",
    "additionally , the minimum in the outgoing longwave radiation shifts poleward and hence modifies the @xmath123 distribution pushing the maximum in @xmath124 at @xmath125n poleward ( figure  [ fig8]@xmath126 ) .",
    "hence , the energy flux equator moves further poleward than initially . as the itcz settles to its final latitude ,",
    "@xmath127 and @xmath128 begin to increase to restore @xmath89 ( @xmath127 increase is reflected in @xmath23 change in figure  [ fig8]@xmath129 ) . despite this the tropical atmosphere remains cooler than in the original @xmath0 simulation as the same flux can be achieved with a reduced @xmath0 if the vertical gradient increases .",
    "how robust is the zonal - mean circulation response to reduction in @xmath0 at low flow speed ? to address this ,",
    "sensitivity experiments are performed under an amip - type setup with both prescribed ssts ( i.e. amipsst ) and with a mixed layer slab ocean lower boundary condition ( i.e. amipsom ) at the lower boundary is governed by @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the ocean density and heat capacity , respectively ; @xmath68 is the annual - mean mixed layer depth ; @xmath133 is the net solar flux absorbed by the ocean ; @xmath134 is the net ocean to atmosphere longwave flux ; and @xmath135 is the prescribed internal ocean heat flux convergence . ] . recall that the amip setup includes the seasonal cycle and the full complexity of atmosphere - ice - land - ocean interaction .",
    "figures[fig14]and[fig15 ] show the circulation response for december - january - february ( djf ) to reduced @xmath0 at low flow speed in the amipsst and amipsom simulations , respectively .",
    "similar responses occur also in other seasons ( not shown ) . despite the weaker response compared to the aquaplanet simulations ,",
    "it is clear from the figures that the zonal - mean circulation response to reduced @xmath0 carries over to more complex setups . in particular",
    ", the response in figures[fig14]and[fig15 ] closely resembles the response in the aquaplanet simulation ( with hemispheres reversed ) forced by the hemispherically - asymmetric `` qobs10n '' sst ( see figure  [ fig8new ] , bottom row ) . given that the sensitivity is not substantially compromised in the presence of the seasonal cycle and the full complexity of atmosphere - ice - land - ocean interaction , the aquaplanet framework appears to be a fruitful avenue for understanding the zonal - mean circulation response in more complex models .",
    "note that the peak in the zonal - mean precipitation maximum in the summer hemisphere weakens but does not move poleward in response to reduced @xmath0 in both experiments .",
    "this is because the reduction in the net equatorial energy input is too small to push the itcz poleward .",
    "note also the presence of a second precipitation maximum in the winter hemisphere .",
    "as discussed earlier , this is because the latitude where @xmath69 changes sign is not barotropic , with the hc return flow rising above the boundary layer at the equator and gradually crossing to the hemisphere with the sst maximum in the free troposphere ( see figures[fig14]@xmath88  and  [ fig15]@xmath88 ) . for a more detailed view , latitude - longitude cross sections of the total precipitation response in the amipsst and amipsom experiments",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig16 ] . in the figure ,",
    "the largest precipitation response occurs over the western and central pacific and the indian ocean .",
    "interestingly , while the circulation sensitivity to reduced @xmath0 is similar in the amipsst and amipsom simulations , the global temperature response is different ; the tropospheric temperature warms globally in the amipsom experiments .",
    "however , the temperature response in the slab ocean simulations appears to be rather sensitive to the internal ocean heat flux and mixed layer depth specification and is therefore not robust .",
    "detailed investigation into this difference between the amipsst and amipsom simulations is , however , outside the scope of this study .",
    "this study explored the sensitivity of the zonal - mean circulation to reduction in air - sea momentum roughness @xmath0 at low flow speed in cam3 under three setups : 1 ) aquaplanet forced by zonally - symmetric time - invariant sst , 2 ) amip - type forced by seasonal sst and sea ice distributions and including the full complexity of atmosphere - ice - land - ocean interaction , and 3 ) amip - type with a mixed layer slab ocean lower boundary condition . in all three setups",
    "the circulation response to reduced @xmath0 at low flow speed is significant and resembles the la ni@xmath1a minus el ni@xmath1o differences in enso variability @xcite with ; i ) a poleward shift of the mid - latitude westerlies extending all the way to the surface ; ii ) a weak poleward shift of the subtropical descent region ; iii ) a weakening of the hc , generally also accompanied by a poleward shift of the itcz and the tropical surface easterlies .",
    "mechanism - denial experiments in the aquaplanet framework pinned down the reduction of tropical latent and sensible heat fluxes ( effected by reducing @xmath0 at low flow speed ) as the main mediators of the circulation response .",
    "the mechanisms behind the circulation response were also elucidated in the aquaplanet framework with an ensemble of reduced @xmath0 switch - on simulations .",
    "the decrease in the tropical latent and sensible heat fluxes into the atmosphere cools the tropical troposphere ( especially in the mid and high altitudes ) and reduces the meridional temperature gradient there . as a result",
    "the hc weakens and , if the reduction in the energy fluxes is large enough ( as in the aquaplanet simulations with `` qobs '' sst profile ) , the upwelling region and the associated itcz shift poleward .",
    "the tropical circulation response is instrumental for the extratropical circulation response .",
    "in particular , a weakened hc is consistent with a weakened subtropical jet .",
    "the weakened jet shifts the upper tropospheric critical latitude region poleward on the equatorward flank of the subtropical jet .",
    "importantly , the surface baroclinicity is also weakened on the equatorward flank of the midlatitude jet as a result of weaker meridional temperature gradients in the subtropics . both the shift in the critical latitude and the reduced baroclinic eddy forcing result in a tripole ep flux divergence anomaly in the upper troposphere that induces a poleward shift in the mid - latitude jet and the hc terminus .",
    "a salient point of this study is that relatively small changes in the parameterization parameters , within the observational constraints , can lead to a large response in the circulation . here",
    "only surface layer parameter sensitivity was explored and in one gcm only .",
    "it is possible that similar changes to the surface layer scheme in gcms other than cam3 produce a different circulation response .",
    "for example , the interaction with other parameterizations might be different ; @xcite found that the itcz moved equatorward ( rather than poleward ) in response to reduced ( and negative ) net moist static energy input to the equator , because the equatorward transport of the latent energy surpassed the poleward transport of the dry static energy ( resulting in negative gross moist stability in the tropics ) in the simulations with a dry convective adjustment scheme .",
    "thus , delineating the interaction of surface layer parameterizations with convection and cloud parameterizations deserves further study .",
    "it is also conceivable that the changes to the momentum budget via reduction in surface stresses play a stronger role in the total response in other gcms ; for example , the wind - evaporation feedback potentially could overcome the weakening of the hc and the poleward itcz shift .",
    "as is shown here , uncertainties in surface process parameterizations are likely to contribute to the systematic errors in gcm simulations together with cloud and convective parameterizations , which are often singled out as sole culprits .",
    "furthermore , it is plausible that reasonable changes in other parameterization parameters can lead to as large a circulation response as observed here .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand such parameter sensitivities in order to delineate non - robust circulation responses to climate forcing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the two anonymous reviewers are thanked for their useful comments , which greatly improved the manuscript .",
