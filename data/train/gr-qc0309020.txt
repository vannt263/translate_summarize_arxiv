    "in the special theory of relativity ( srt ) the rotation of the reference frame , contrary to the translation , has an absolute character and can be locally measured by the foucault s pendulum or by the sagnac experiment .",
    "indeed , this peculiarity of rotation , inherited by newtonian physics , is difficult to understand in a relativistic context . as a matter of fact",
    ", many authors who were contrary to srt , had found , in the relativistic approach to rotation , important arguments against the self - consistency of the theory . already in 1909",
    "ehrenfest@xcite pointed out an internal contradiction in srt , applied to the case of a rotating disk ; few years later , in 1913 , sagnac@xcite,@xcite evidenced an apparent contradiction in srt with respect to the experimental data .    since those years",
    ", these seminal papers had influenced discussions on the foundations of srt , even if these `` paradoxes '' disappear when a careful analysis is undertaken , following the very axioms of the theory .",
    "however , it may appear surprising that , even after one century , in some papers or in textbooks , misleading or even uncorrect arguments are given to explain the ehrenfest s paradox and the sagnac effect .",
    "for instance , klauber in 1998 @xcite,@xcite proposed a  new theory of rotating frames  , in order to amend the contradictions which , according to him , appear in srt when applied to rotating frames .",
    "elsewhere@xcite we carefully studied the ehrenfest s paradox , showing that it can be solved on the bases of purely kinematical arguments in srt .",
    "to this end , we adopted a geometrical approach , based on ( i ) a precise definition of the concept of  space of the disk  , ( ii ) a precise choice of the  standard rods  used by the observers on the platform .",
    "the space of the disk has been formally identified with what we called the `` relative space '' ; its geometry has been recognized to be non - euclidean and its metric coincides with the one which is found in classic textbooks of relativity , in spite of a shift of the context , that we have stressed .",
    "we adopted the projection technique introduced by cattaneo@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to approach the problem , since this allows an elegant and straightforward description of the geometry of any reference frame .",
    "even though a global _ isotropic _ @xmath0 splitting of space - time is not possible when we deal with rotating observers , the introduction of the relative space allows well defined procedures for space measurements that can be actually performed globally by the observers in rotating frames and which reduce to the standard measurements in any locally co - moving inertial frames .",
    "here we are going to show that these procedures allow a systematic study of the space measurements , which makes the ehrenfest s paradox disappear .",
    "moreover , we are going to illustrate in a clear way ( with the aid of a pictorial representation ) the kinematical origin of the dilation which leads to the solution of the ehrenfest s paradox .    according to us the concept of relative space can help to make rid of lots of misunderstandings , often caused by the lack of proper definitions of some crucial concepts in the theoretical apparatus used to describe these physical problems : indeed , they may appear puzzling or contradictory in srt only when ambiguous entities and procedures are adopted .",
    "according to ehrenfest@xcite , the formulation of the paradox is the following one :    let @xmath1 be the radii of the rotating disk , as measured , respectively , by the inertial and rotating observer ; @xmath2 is the constant angular velocity of the disk , as measured in the inertial frame .",
    "the paradox arises when the following contradictory statements are taken into account :    \\(a ) the circumference of the disk must show a contraction relative to its rest state , @xmath3 , since each element of the circumference moves in its own direction with instantaneous speed @xmath4 .",
    "( b ) if one considers an element of a radius , its instantaneous velocity is perpendicular to its length ; thus , an element of the radius can not show a contraction with respect to the rest state .",
    "therefore @xmath5    on the bases of this contradiction , ehrenfest pointed out the apparent inconsistence of the kinematics of bodies which are rigid , according to the definition of rigidity given by born ( see below ) . + despite the great number of authors who tried to explain the paradox , the most popular attempts of solution can be summarized in this way :    * neither the rods along the rim nor the circumference do contract ; neither the rods along the radius nor the radius itself do contract ; as a consequence , the space of the rotating disk is euclidean ; + _ ( see f.i .",
    "tartaglia@xcite , klauber@xcite,@xcite ) _ * both the rods along the rim and the circumference contract ; neither the rods along the radius nor the radius itself do contract ; as a consequence the surface of the disk bends , because of rotation . + _ ( sted - donaldson@xcite , galli@xcite ) _ * rods along the rim do contract , while the circumference does not ; neither the rods along the radius nor the radius itself do contract . as a consequence",
    "the space of the disk is not euclidean : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the lorentz factor ; + _ ( einstein@xcite , berenda@xcite , arzelis@xcite , grn@xcite,@xcite , mller @xcite , landau - lifshitz@xcite ) _",
    "let us say few words about why these solution are not completely satisfactory .",
    "+ the approach ( 1 ) is , indeed , the one which is in agreement with the common sense , since people can hardly figure out how non - euclidean features may appear on a disk because of its rotation",
    ". however , to maintain the statement `` nothing happens on a rotating disk '' a remarkable price must be paid . for instance , klauber analysis is based on a deep criticism of the foundations of srt : he claims that srt can not be applied to rotating frames , but it must be deeply amended to take into account the non inertial motion of rotating observers . in particular , he maintains that the `` hypothesis of locality''(see mashhoon@xcite ) , which states the local equivalence of an accelerated observer with a momentarily co - moving inertial observer , is not valid in rotating frames .",
    "accordingly , his approach appears a challenge to the very foundations of relativity , because the hypothesis of locality is one of the most important axioms of theory .",
    "dropping this axiom ( which ultimately is justified by the experimental observations ) forces us to abandon the idea that the theory of relativity can describe the physical world , since , actually , there are no perfectly inertial frames in the real world acceleration '' . ] .    on the other hands ,",
    "tartaglia s result can be justified and accepted if and only if a specific choice of the measuring rods is done . however",
    ", this choice is questionable when applied to the case of a rotating disk : tartaglia s measuring rods are not the standard rods of srt . as we shall show in sec .",
    "[ sec : georot ] below , in srt we can locally substitute the light rays for the standard rigid rods ; furthermore , we shall show in sec .",
    "[ sec : lengths ] that a careful study of the effects of an acceleration process explains the kinematical origin of the ehrenfest paradox .",
    "the approach ( 2 ) introduces difficulties in the explanation of the paradox ( for instance the dynamical properties of the rotating disk must be taken into account ) and inconsistencies : a non symmetric deformation with respect to the plane of the non - rotating disk should determine a screw sense in space , thus violating spatial parity _ in a purely kinematical context_.    finally , the approach ( 3 ) formally agrees with ours : however , those authors do not define explicitly the geometric context in which measurements are made .",
    "moreover , some of them refer to the `` space of the disk '' as if it were a submanifold or a subspace embedded in space - time : this is not the case , since the lack of time - orthogonality ( see below ) does not allow a global @xmath0 splitting . here",
    ", we are going to show that the relative space is the only extended space , having a clear operational meaning , that can be formally defined as the physical space of the disk .",

    "these helixes fill , without intersecting , the whole space - time region defined by @xmath27 ; is usually imposed : this simply means that the velocity of the points of the disk can not reach the velocity of light . ]",

    ", we label each event @xmath41 in @xmath29 using the time of a clock at rest in @xmath14 , whose world - line ( a straight line parallel to the time axis ) intersects @xmath41 , and not by means of a clock at rest on the disk .",
    "the transformation ( [ catt ] ) has a galilean character , and this is due to the peculiarity of angular velocity which , contrary to translational velocity , has an absolute value , that can be locally measured . + * remark * the parameterization of the rotating frame @xmath29 by the coordinate @xmath16 of the inertial frame @xmath14 is the only way to synchronize the clocks ( globally ) on the platform : in fact their proper times can not be synchronized by einstein s convention , because of rotation .",
    "we recall here that a physical frame is said to be _ time - orthogonal _ when there exists at least one adapted chart in which @xmath42 : this means that the lines @xmath43 are orthogonal to the 3-manifold @xmath44 .",
    "this is an intrinsic property of the physical frame , i.e. it does not depend on the coordinates used to parameterize the frame . a way to characterize",
    "this feature is the introduction of the `` spatial vortex tensor '' , which is a tensor for coordinate transformation `` internal '' to the physical frame .",
    "the spatial vortex tensor of the rotating frame @xmath29 is not null : hence this is not a time - orthogonal frame . in particular ,",
    "a global clocks synchronization is impossible in these non time - orthogonal frames@xcite .      using the metric ( [ born ] ) the line element , in the chart @xmath39 ,",
    "is written in the general axis - symmetric form : @xmath45    we can introduce the local spatial geometry of the disk , which defines the proper spatial line element , on the basis of the local optical geometry . to this end",
    "we can use the radar method@xcite , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath46 be a point in the rotating frame , where a light source , a light absorber and a clock are lodged ; let @xmath47 be a near point where a reflector is lodged .",
    "the world - lines of these points are the time like helices @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see figure [ fig : radar ] ) .",
    "a light signal is emitted by the source in @xmath46 and propagates along the null world - line @xmath50 toward @xmath47 ; here it is reflected back to @xmath46 ( along the null world - line @xmath51 ) , where it is finally absorbed .",
    "let @xmath52 be the proper time , read by a clock in @xmath46 , between the emission and absorption events : then , according to the radar method , the proper distance between @xmath46 and @xmath47 is defined by @xmath53    now , we are going to parameterize these events , using the coordinates adapted to the rotating frame , in order to obtain the explicit expression of the proper spatial line element .",

    "the space - time intervals between the events of emission @xmath56 and reflection @xmath20 , and between the events of reflection @xmath20 and absorption @xmath57 , are null .",
    "hence , by setting @xmath58 in ( [ eq : bornline ] ) , we can solve for @xmath59 , and obtain the two solutions : @xmath60 which correspond to the propagation along the two directions between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . and @xmath51 .",
    "] so , if @xmath61 is the coordinate time of the reflection event , the coordinate times of the emission and absorption events are , respectively , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "in general this method leads to defining the proper spatial line element in the form : @xmath69 where @xmath70 can be thought of as a `` spatial metric tensor '' . according to eq .",

    "and @xmath49 are the world - lines of the two neighbouring points @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the rotating frame , between which a light signal propagates .",
    "the event @xmath56 corresponds to the emission of the light signal ( at time @xmath75 ) which propagates along the null world - line @xmath50 .",
    "the events @xmath20 corresponds to the reflection of the signal ( at time @xmath76 ) which , after propagating along the null world line @xmath51 , is absorbed at the space - time event @xmath57 ( at time @xmath77).,width=264,height=264 ]    in the previous section we have outlined the local spatial geometry of a rotating disk on the bases of the local optical geometry .",
    "namely , when light rays are used , locally , as standard rods , the line element which allows measurements of lengths is given by ( [ eq : spaceline ] ) .",
    "this local spatial geometry is defined at each point of the rotating frame . however , in order to have the possibility of confronting measurements performed at different points in the frame , a procedure to extend all over the disk the local spatial geometry is required .",
    "but this can not be done in a straightforward way , because a rotating frame is not time - orthogonal and hence it is not possible to choose an adapted charted in which , globally , the lines @xmath78 are orthogonal to the 3-manifold @xmath44 ( each of which is described by the metric ( [ eq : metricagamma ] ) ) . in other words , a global foliation , which would lead `` naturally '' to the definition of the space of the disk , is not allowed .    nevertheless ,",
    "if we shift the context , from the ill defined notion of space of the disk thought of as a subspace or a submanifold embedded in space - time , to a definition which has a well defined and operational meaning , we are lead to the concept of the `` relative space '' . to this end ,",
    "first of all let us start from a more formal description of the local splitting of space - time that allows us to write the local spatial metric ( [ eq : metricagamma ] ) .",
    "let @xmath79 be a time - like helix , describing the evolution of a point of the disk , and let @xmath41 be an event which belongs to @xmath79 .",
    "we can identify a 1-dimensional vector space @xmath80 ( `` time direction '' ) , which is spanned by the vector tangent to @xmath79 in @xmath41 , and a 3-dimensional vector space @xmath81 ( `` space platform '' ) , normal to @xmath80 ; @xmath81 is endowed with the metric ( [ eq : metricagamma ] ) .",
    "hence the space tangent to @xmath41 has a splitting in the form @xmath82 .",
    "this local splitting has an important property : * * * * _ _ the splitting _",
    "_ @xmath83 _ _  and the spatial metric tensor _ _ @xmath84 are invariant along the lines of congruence @xmath28 , i.e. they are dragged along the world evolution .",
    "this property is strictly related to the rigidity of the rotating frame , namely it depends on the fact that the metric ( [ born ] ) is globally stationary and the metric ( [ eq : metricagamma ] ) is locally static .",
    "in particular , it can be explained in terms of isometries , i.e. killing fields in the submanifold @xmath85 of the space - time(see @xcite ) . as a consequence it is possible to define a one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms with respect to which both the splitting @xmath82 and the space metric tensor @xmath84 are invariant .",
    "the lines of @xmath28 constitute the trajectories of this `` space  @xmath86  time isometry '' .",
    "+ this fact suggests a procedure to define an _ extended 3-space _ , which we shall call _ relative space_. naively , it can be thought of as the union of the infinitesimal ( local ) space platforms , but a more rigorous definition can be given : + * definition . *",
    "each element of the relative space is an equivalence class of _ points and of space platforms _ , which verify this equivalence relation :    re[relequiv ] : _  `` two points ( two space platforms ) are equivalent if they belong to the same line of the congruence ' ' _ .",
    "that is , the _ relative space _ is the `` quotient space '' of the world tube of the disk , with respect to the equivalence relation re , among points and space platforms belonging to the lines of the congruence @xmath28 .",
    "this definition simply means that the relative space is the manifold whose  points  _ are _ the lines of the congruence .",
    "our definition emphasizes the role of the space platforms : the reference frame defined ( as above ) by the relative space coincides _ everywhere _ with the local rest frame of the rotating disk .",
    "in other words , the relative space is a formal tool which allows a connection among all the local optical geometries that are defined in the neighbourhood of each point of the space . as a consequence ,",
    "space measurements globally defined in the relative space reduce , immediately , to standard measurements in any local frame , co - moving with the disk . in this way , a natural procedure to make a comparison between observations performed by observers at different points is available .",
    "the physical context in which these distant observations are made , is defined , both from a mathematical and operational point of view , by the relative space .",
    "we want to stress , again , that it is not possible to describe the relative space in terms of space - time foliation , i.e. in the form @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is an appropriate coordinate time , because the space of the disk , as we saw before , is not time - orthogonal .",
    "hence , thinking of the space of the disk as a sub - manifold or a subspace embedded in the space - time is misleading : instead , the space of the disk , defined by the relative space , must be thought of as a quotient space .",
    "if we long for some kind of visualization , we can think of the relative space as the union of the infinitesimal space platforms , each of which is associated , by means of the request of m - orthogonality , to one and only one of lines of the congruence .",
    "after having introduced the relative space and described its geometry , we come back to our original purposes , i.e. the solution of the ehrenfest s paradox .",
    "space measurements are locally performed by a rotating observer by means of the spatial metric tensor @xmath89 :    @xmath90    as a consequence , the length of an infinitesimal segment on the rim of the circumference is @xmath91 from ( [ catt])@xmath92 it follows that at fixed coordinate time of the inertial frame @xmath14 , @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , the angle all around the periphery of the disk , measured on it , is equal to @xmath94 : @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "+ hence , the measurement of the circumference on the rim of the disk , performed by the rotating observer , turns out to be : @xmath96 we want to stress that the dilation appearing in ( [ eq : lsigma ] ) has a pure kinematical origin and by no means it ought to be interpreted as a dynamical process , involving the structure of the disk , as some authors claimed in the past@xcite .",
    "the meaning of this dilation will be made clear in next section .",
    "for the observer in the inertial frame the length given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dlsigma ] ) appears contracted by the standard factor @xmath97 : @xmath98 since @xmath99 we obtain that , in correspondence to the measure of the circumference given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lsigma ] ) , performed by the rotating observer , the inertial observer measures a length @xmath100 , as expected , since the space of the inertial frame @xmath14 is euclidean .    the expression ( [ eq : lsigma ] )",
    "is in agreement with the fact that the space geometry of the disk is not euclidean : a curvature tensor can be computed and it is not null . + * remark 1 .",
    "* in the past , different authors , like berenda@xcite , arzelis@xcite , grn@xcite calculated the curvature of the space of the disk .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that they did not define the proper geometrical context in which their calculation were performed ; moreover , their calculations do not rely upon the use of a splitting technique : they just computed the components of the curvature tensor of the _ space - time _ which have all spatial indices ( @xmath101 ) , and they referred to it as the _ space _ curvature tensor . on the other hands , we showed that the relative space is the natural context in which space measurements are performed and we computed its curvature ( see @xcite ) using the cattaneo s splitting technique .",
    "nevertheless their results are equal to ours , and this is due to the fact that , for the rotating disk in uniform motion , the physical frame is stationary ; however , things are different for those physical reference frames which lack symmetries , such as the axis - symmetry and the stationarity of the rotating disk . +",
    "we want to clarify , here , the origin of the dilation appearing in ( [ eq : lsigma ] ) , which , as we showed , is ultimately responsible for the solution of the ehrenfest s paradox . in order to do that",

    "often , in the literature on these subjects , misunderstandings arise , and we believe that they rely on the lack of clear and self consistent definitions of the fundamental concepts used .    according to us , the concept of relative space makes clear , in a mathematical way , the physical context in which measurements are performed by rotating observers .",

    ", it appears that srt , even when applied to rotating platforms , is self - consistent and does not raise paradoxes , provided that proper definitions of geometrical and kinematical entities are adopted .",
    "we believe that our approach to the study of these apparently paradoxical problems leads to a deeper understandings of the very foundations of the theory and evidences , in a clear way , some operational aspects of the measurement processes involved . + * acknowledgements * the author is grateful to professor guido rizzi , for valuable suggestions and comments ."

    "<S> we introduce here the concept of relative space , an extended 3-space which is recognized as the only space having an operational meaning in the study of the space geometry of a rotating disk . accordingly , we illustrate how space measurements are performed in the relative space , and we show that an old - aged puzzling problem , that is the ehrenfest s paradox , is explained in this purely relativistic context . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we illustrate the kinematical origin of the tangential dilation which is responsible for the solution of the ehrenfest s paradox . </S>"
