    "since the time of @xmath2 for the ssc detectors @xcite it has been understood that the main source of background in a detector at modern colliders are collisions at interaction point . the contribution from other sources ( beam gas interactions , beam halo particles , etc . ) estimated to be below 10%@xcite .",
    "extensive simulations of background conditions were part of detectors optimizations for ssc and lhc experiments .",
    "atlas@xcite and cms@xcite have made simulations for all types of backgrounds including neutrons .",
    "estimations of the neutron fluxes in experimental areas were based on simulations only , without support from experimentally measured data .",
    "only recently the atlas - mpx collaboration@xcite published results of absolute background measurements in the atlas experimental hall including thermal neutrons and made a comparison with results of simulations with geant3+gcalor@xcite and fluka@xcite .",
    "their conclusion was @xcite : `` measured thermal neutron fluxes are found to be largely in agreement with the original simulations , mostly within a factor of two .",
    "significant deviations are observed in the low radiation regions of atlas cavern , where measured thermal neutron fluxes are found to be lower than predicted by monte carlo simulations . ''",
    "the star detector at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic)@xcite is planning series of upgrades in the near future with detectors using different types of silicon sensors",
    ". reliable estimations of neutron background at star are required to evaluate different technologies for these upgrades .",
    "this necessity and the lack of experimental results for neutron background estimates were our motivations for this work .",
    "same questions have been raised in context of ongoing detector r&d for proposed electron ion collider ( eic@xcite ) :    * what are neutron background conditions currently at the star detector and will be at eic ? * how reliable can we estimate these conditions ?    to answer these questions",
    "we :    * made measurement of the absolute thermal neutron flux at different locations in the star@xcite wide angle hall ( wah ) during rhic run 13@xcite , * compared experimental results with simulation in order to understand how reliable this simulation is , and * estimated fluxes of the intermediate energy neutrons using simulation results .    for the purpose of future discussions we will classify neutrons by kinetic energy(@xmath3 ) as follows :    * intermediate energy neutrons with @xmath3 in range 100  kev@xmath41  mev , which are most damaging for electronics and silicon detectors , and * thermal neutrons with @xmath3 below 250 mev .",
    "this definition includes cold ( @xmath5 ) , thermal as such ( @xmath6 ) , and part of epithermal ( 25  mev@xmath7400  mev ) neutrons .",
    "the thermal neutrons generate @xmath8quanta producing noise in detector elements .",
    "we used a @xmath9 filled proportional counter@xcite ( @xmath10 ) , loaned to us by bnl instrumentation division , to measure fluxes of thermal neutrons in wah .    * the thermal neutron were detected via reaction : @xmath11 with cross section : @xmath12 [ kbarn]@xcite . *",
    "the @xmath10 specification@xcite gave the neutron sensitivity @xmath13 counts per @xmath14 of thermal neutron flux .",
    "this sensitivity was measured with calibrated isotropic thermal neutron flux at a temperature of @xmath15c@xcite . *",
    "the signal was shaped with the threshold set to 20% of the maximum signal ( 764 kev ) , which corresponds to an unambiguous thermal neutron registration ( contamination of @xmath16 and charged particles were due to only multiple hits during signal collection time of the detector @xmath1 5 @xmath17 and neglected herein ) .",
    "* during the run @xmath10 was positioned at 6 locations@xcite of wah ( fig.[fig : wah ] ) : the * south * and * north * ( fig.[fig : southnorth ] ) on the level of the second platform just outside of mtd from the south and north sides of the detector , the * bottom * on the floor under mtd ( fig.[fig : bottom ] and fig.[fig : faraway ] ) , the * west * and * east * near the entrances to the tunnel ( fig.[fig : westeast ] ) , and the * far away * ( fig.[fig : faraway ] ) on the floor just after the entrance to wah .    the shaped @xmath10 signal was fed to the so called star rich scalers ( channel 16 ) , and the rate of the scaler ( hz ) was recorded in star online database ( each 15 s ) and in star daq stream ( with frequency 1 hz ) together with others scalers ( particularly , zdc west , zdc east , and zdc west and east coincidence ) . the @xmath10 rate versus date of data taking for different counter locations is shown in fig.[fig : countrate ] .      in this study",
    "we used the east and west zdc scalers . in order to estimate event rate [ mhz ] the following approach@xcite",
    "was used :    * @xmath18 : number of bunch crossings , * @xmath19 : number of crossings that contain a coincidence of the west and east counters with probability + @xmath20 , * @xmath21 : number of crossings that contain a hit in the east counter , @xmath22 , * @xmath23 : number of crossings that contain a hit in the west counter , @xmath24 , * @xmath25 : a probability to produce an east hit , * @xmath26 : a probability to produce a west hit , * @xmath27 : a probability to produce at least one or more east and west coincidences in the beam crossing .",
    "then we used 3 equations : @xmath28 and solved them with respect to @xmath27 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mean value of poisson distribution .",
    "thus the coincidence rate ( ab ) corrected for random coincidence for a and b is @xmath31 the coincidence rate in zdc corresponded to @xmath32 = 2.81 mb@xcite from 50 mb of pp@xcite inelastic cross section at @xmath0 = 510 gev .",
    "thus the total event rate : @xmath33 .",
    "the measured fluxes are obtained from the @xmath10 rate ( * c * ) using the counter sensitivity .",
    "dependences of the measured * c * at the different locations on * @xmath34 * are shown in fig.[fig : fluxes ] . in order to normalize * c * to 1 mhz of pp interaction rate ( * @xmath35 * ) and",
    "also account for saturation effects in @xmath10 due to its dead time , the dependences were approximated by * @xmath36 * the measurements of * @xmath37 * for different locations are presented in table [ table ] .    .the",
    "measured @xmath10 rate ( * @xmath37 * ) , the estimated from the @xmath10 rate neutron flux for @xmath38 ( rc ) using the counter sensitivity ( 100@xmath3910 counts/(@xmath40 ) ) and its efficiencies in the kinematical range ( @xmath41 ) , simulated ( mc ) thermal neutron flux @xmath42 , and ratio rc to mc for the different @xmath10 locations in wah .",
    "all numbers are normalized per 1 mhz of pp inelastic collisions at @xmath0 = 510 gev . [",

    "to estimate fluxes , pythia version 6.4.26@xcite as pp 510 gev minimum biased event generator and geant3+gcalor@xcite for propagation particles in wah were used .",
    "the star detector and wah geometry description was taken as version @xmath43@xcite used for rhic run 13 .",
    "the only two essential changes from default star simulation were :    \\(1 ) reducing @xmath3 cut for neutral hadrons ( cutneu ) from 1 mev to @xmath44 gev , and    \\(2 ) increasing maximum particle time of flight cut ( tofmax ) from @xmath45 to @xmath46 s.    the simulated @xmath3 spectrum of neutrons in wah and the spectrum convoluted with the neutron cross section are presented in fig.[fig : ekin ] . from this spectrum",
    "we can conclude that @xmath41 of neutrons with @xmath47 were detected by @xmath10 .",
    "the neutron s time of flight distribution from the simulation is presented in fig.[fig : ntof ] .",
    "there are two distinct components in the distribution : the first one with @xmath48 = 7.1 ms which corresponds to neutron dissipation from wah and the second component suppressed by a factor of @xmath49 with respect to the first one with @xmath50 which is due to neutron decays ( in the simulation neutron life time @xmath51 was used ) .",
    "unfortunately , with our maximum recording rate of 1 hz we could not detect the dissipation component .",
    "flux was defined as sum of track length of a particle collected in a given volume in unit time divided by the volume size .",
    "the fluxes were normalized to 1 mhz rate of pp inelastic events at @xmath0 = 510 gev .",
    "fluxes for all neutrons and neutrons with @xmath38 are show in fig.[fig : neutron ] and fig.[fig : thermalneutron ] , respectively .",
    "the radial dependence of fluxes at z @xmath52 0 and z @xmath52 675 cm for all neutrons , neutrons with @xmath53 and neutrons with @xmath38 are shown in fig.[fig : neutronsz ] .",
    "from this study we conclude that we can estimate neutron background for star detector with good precision .",
    "the results of the measurement and simulation are presented with absolute values and their ratios in table [ table ] .",
    "the comparison is good ( within @xmath54 ) for the * west * , * east * and * far away * locations .",
    "however , for the * south * , * north * and * bottom * locations the simulation overestimated flux by a factor of @xmath1 3 .",
    "this conclusion is very close to one @xcite which we cited in the introduction .",
    "the mismatch between the measurement and the simulation may be due to inaccurate description of geometry and material in the wah , which would affect the neutron dissipation from the interaction region .",
    "the deviation could also be related to the neutron transport parameters .",
