    "a common question in many areas is the evaluation of correlations between several measurements , given the microscopic dynamics of the system .",
    "this problem comes up for instance in the calculation of cosmological perturbations @xcite , or in nuclear physics , e.g. in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "these situations have in common that they are described by some underlying quantum field theory , and that the system starts from some supposedly known initial state .",
    "then , it evolves under the effect of the self - interactions of the fields , and possibly the couplings to some external sources .",
    "thereafter , we define an observable as some local operator @xmath1 constructed from the fields of the theory .",
    "our goal in this paper is to study ( at leading order in the couplings ) the correlations between measurements of this observable at several space - time points @xmath2 , @xmath3 in this definition , we have assumed that the system is initially in the perturbative vacuum state ( see the appendices [ app : coherent ] and [ app : mixed ] for a discussion of the changes with other types of initial states ) .",
    "the subscript `` c '' indicates the connected part of this expectation value , i.e. the terms that contain the actual correlations . an important restriction in our discussion will be to consider only points @xmath4 that all have space - like separations , i.e. @xmath5 .",
    "physically , this means that the measurement performed at one of the points can not influence the outcome of the measurement at another point .",
    "therefore , the correlations between the measurements are entirely due to the past evolution of the system .    the main difference compared to the more familiar problem of computing cross - sections is that the final state is not prescribed .",
    "instead , one wishes to calculate the expectation value of some operators , by summing over _ all the possible final states _ given a prescribed initial state . ] .",
    "one could in principle perform such a calculation by using the usual techniques for calculating transition amplitudes , by first writing @xmath6 ( the double sum over final states could be reduced to a single sum if we use eigenstates of the observable @xmath7 . )",
    "all the steps involved in this pedestrian approach can be encapsulated in a set of diagrammatic rules known as the schwinger - keldysh formalism , or in - in formalism @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , that roughly consists in two copies of the usual feynman rules ( one that gives the factor @xmath8 , and one complex conjugated that gives the factor @xmath9 ) , plus some additional rules that give the final state sum .",
    "the approach we follow in this paper bears heavily on earlier works in the field of heavy ion collisions @xcite and in cosmology @xcite .",
    "although the approach used in this paper and the final result are quite general , the intermediate derivations are a bit cumbersome . in order to keep the notations as light as possible",
    ", we consider a theory with a single real scalar field @xmath10 , whose lagrangian density is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 contains the self - interactions of the field and @xmath13 is an external source . the quantum field theory described by the lagrangian density ( [ eq : lag ] )",
    "has a well known perturbative expansion .",
    "however , we are interested in this paper in the _ strong field regime _ , where this perturbative expansion is insufficient .",
    "this corresponds to fields for which the interaction term @xmath12 is as large as the kinetic term @xmath14 , @xmath15 implying that the interactions can not be treated as a perturbation .",
    "for instance , for a theory with a quartic interaction term @xmath16 , this occurs for fields @xmath17 where @xmath18 is some typical momentum scale in the problem ( the field @xmath10 has the dimension of a momentum in four space - time dimensions ) . for fields driven by an external source",
    ", the term @xmath19 must also have the same order of magnitude as the kinetic and self - interaction terms , and thus the order of magnitude of the source that may create this large field is @xmath20 in order to see where the usual perturbative expansion fails , let us recall the power counting in the case of a theory with a @xmath21 interaction term .",
    "the order of magnitude of a connected graph @xmath22 with @xmath23 external legs , @xmath24 loops and @xmath25 external sources is given by @xmath26 eq .",
    "( [ eq : largej ] ) implies that @xmath27 can not be treated as a small expansion parameter .",
    "any quantity must therefore be evaluated non - perturbatively in the number of sources @xmath25 .",
    "in contrast , the hierarchy of the contributions based on the number of loops in the feynman diagrams survives . our aim is to calculate the correlation function ( [ eq : corr - def ] ) to lowest order in the number of loops ( i.e. at tree level ) but to all order in @xmath25 ( or equivalently to all orders in the field amplitude ) .    with large fields ,",
    "the correlation function ( [ eq : corr - def ] ) is suppressed compared to the uncorrelated part , because each propagator connecting a pair of observables costs a factor @xmath28 ( the endpoints of such a link replace two fields of order @xmath29 ) . in order to fully connect the @xmath30 observables , @xmath31 propagators are necessary , suppressing the correlation by a factor @xmath32 with respect to the uncorrelated part .",
    "thus , in a certain sense , the correlation function may be viewed as a higher order correction . at leading order ,",
    "@xmath33-point functions ( i.e. the expectation value of a local observable ) are obtained from a classical solution of the field equation of motion , obeying a retarded boundary condition that depends on the initial state ( @xmath34 when the initial state is the perturbative vacuum ) @xcite .",
    "their next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections are also known @xcite , and can be expressed in terms of functional derivatives of this classical field with respect to its initial condition .",
    "a similar result was proven in @xcite for the nlo correction to a @xmath35-point function , that contains its tree - level correlated part .    in this paper , we assess to what extent a similar representation exists for the correlated part of higher @xmath30-point functions at tree - level .",

    ", we couple the observable @xmath1 to a fictitious source @xmath37 in order to define a generating functional whose derivatives give the expectation for the combined measurement of @xmath1 at several points .",
    "we explain how to obtain this generating functional diagrammatically by extending the schwinger - keldysh formalism with an extra vertex that corresponds to the observable , and then we rephrase this diagrammatic expansion in the retarded - advanced basis , that will be useful to discuss the strong field regime . in the section [ sec:1der ] ,",
    "we study the first derivative of the generating functional . at leading order",
    ", it can be expressed in terms of a pair of fields that obey classical equations of motion and satisfy non - trivial @xmath38-dependent boundary conditions . in the following section [ sec : expansion ]",
    ", we set up an expansion of these fields order by order in powers of the function @xmath37 , and we determine explicitly the first two orders , that give the @xmath33-point and @xmath35-point correlation functions .",
    "we also show how to rewrite the @xmath35-point function in terms of derivatives of a classical field with respect to its initial condition . in the section [ sec : strong ] , we consider the strong field approximation , and we determine the solution to all orders in @xmath38 in this approximation .",
    "we show that the tree level @xmath30-point correlation function in this approximation can be represented as the sum of all trees with @xmath30 labeled nodes ( the @xmath30 instances of the observable ) , and pairwise links that are differential operators with respect to the initial condition of the classical field .",
    "the section [ sec : beyond ] illustrates on the example of the @xmath0-point function the type of contributions that arise at tree level beyond the strong field approximation .",

    "for simplicity , we will take the points @xmath4 where the measurements are performed to lie on the same surface of constant time @xmath39 , but the final results would be valid for any locally space - like surface ( in order to ensure that there is no causal relation between the points @xmath4 ) .",

    "moreover , the expressions can be systematically represented by trees , where the nodes are the observables and the links are pairs of derivatives with respect to the initial condition of the classical field .",
    "physically , these links correspond to correlations induced by fluctuations in the initial state .    in the last section , we departed from the strong field approximation and considered the tree - level @xmath0-point correlation function in full .",
