    "a key technological hurdle in the study of single molecules in the condensed phase is to achieve a tight focus in the cryostat . here",

    "[ setup]b , a molded glass aspheric lens with @xmath13 and a working distance of 1.76  mm focused the laser beam onto the sample , and a second identical lens was used to re - collimate it in the forward direction .",
    "a cubic zirconia half - ball lens with a diameter of 3  mm and a refractive index of about 2.18 was used as a sil .",
    "piezoelectrically driven slip - stick sliders were used to adjust the lateral and axial positions of the aspheric lenses with respect to the sil .",
    "[ setup]d shows a confocal fluorescence excitation scan of a single molecule .",
    "we achieved a focal spot with a full width at half - maximum of about 370  nm at @xmath14 .",
    "although this still does not meet the diffraction limit , it constitutes a great improvement over previous cryogenic far - field resolutions and allowed us to perform several new experiments , as described in the following .",
    "figure  [ setup]c sketches the experimental arrangement . a tunable dye laser with a linewidth of 1  mhz was used to excite the molecules .",
    "the laser beam could be scanned across the sample with the aid of galvanometric mirrors .",
    "a berek variable waveplate was used to pre - compensate for a slight elliptical polarization that was accumulated along the optical path and to ensure linear polarization at the position of the molecule .",
    "the samples consisted of a shpolskii matrix doped with dibenzanthanthrene ( dbatt ) molecules  @xcite . to prepare a sample ,",
    "a small amount of dbatt was dissolved in _",
    "n_-tetradecane , applied to the flat side of the solid immersion lens and then squeezed and held in place by a glass cover slip . the 0 - 0 vibronic transition of dbatt in _",
    "n_-tetradecane is at a wavelength of @xmath15  nm .",
    "we routinely measured near to natural lifetime limited linewidths of 17 - 20mhz consistent with our independent measurements of 9.7  ns for the excited state fluorescence lifetime .",
    "another favorable feature of dbatt is a very short triplet state lifetime  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ setup]c shows three detection channels that were used for various measurements discussed in this article .",
    "the avalanche photodiode pd1 recorded the intensity of the transmitted light close to the excitation wavelength @xmath2 by using a short - pass filter .",
    "the second detector ( pd2 ) was situated after a long - pass filter and registered the stokes shifted fluorescence on transitions @xmath16 . a third detector ( pd3 )",
    "was used in combination with other optical elements to record the resonance fluorescence intensity in reflection . in each experimental run , single molecules were first identified and characterised on pd2 using conventional fluorescence excitation spectroscopy .",
    "after optimization of the lateral focus position ( see fig .",
    "[ setup]d ) , the polarization of the excitation light was aligned with the dipole moment of the molecule .",

    "a dip of @xmath17 is observed directly in transmission when a single molecule is resonant with the laser beam .",
    "the noise level amounts to 0.7% , corresponding to the shot - noise limit of the incident intensity over an integration time of 160  ms per pixel .",
    "we emphasize that no noise suppression technique such as lock - in detection was employed in this work .    although one might be inclined to attribute the observed dip to  absorption \" , the excitation spectrum @xmath19 registered on the detector has to take into account the interference between the excitation field @xmath20 and the field @xmath21 scattered by the molecule  @xcite according to @xmath22 in our recent work using snom  @xcite we expressed the detector signal in detail , accounting for the modal evolution of the incident and scattered fields and for the spectroscopic properties of the molecule . here",

    "equation  ( [ f - g ] ) describes the spectrum that one registers on a detector as one scans the laser frequency .",
    "the first term is simply the part of the incident intensity that arrives at the detector .",
    "the second term proportional to @xmath30 represents the molecular emission and is always positive . in total , it consists of the narrow - band resonance fluorescence at @xmath2  @xcite , the phonon wing of this transition caused by the vibrational coupling of the molecule with the matrix , and the stokes - shifted fluorescence emitted at @xmath8 . in the signals detected on pd1 and pd3 ,",

    "denotes the interference between @xmath20 and the coherent part of @xmath21 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we showed various examples where @xmath32 could be varied , resulting in dispersive transmission spectra . in the weak excitation limit , the transmission signal on detector pd1 is dominated by the interference component , also known as the _ extinction _ term .",
    "we emphasize that the observed interference effect depends on the mode overlap between the molecular emission and the incident beam and can be influenced by the choice of the detection solid angle . in our case",
    ", total internal reflection at the asymmetric geometry of the sil - sample - glass - air layers can lead to a fine structure in the reflected beam  @xcite and take away energy from the transmitted beam .",
    "this arrangement also results in a strongly asymmetric molecular emission pattern which favors emission into the sil side by about ten times  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for a given geometry the spectroscopic features of the emitter play an imporant role .",
    "the emission associated with the narrow - band zero - phonon line of the 0 - 0 vibronic transition is lowered by the debye - waller and franck - condon factors @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which amount to 0.25 and 0.3 in our system  @xcite , respectively .",
    "thus , as compared to a perfect two - level system in the same geometric configuration , our molecule has had @xmath35 times weaker coherent interaction with the laser beam .",
    "in addition to providing a strong detection signature , direct extinction spectroscopy offers the great advantage that it gives access to the narrow - band emission on the zero - phonon line .",
    "the radiation of a two - level system at the wavelength of the excited optical transition is known as resonance fluorescence . in case of weak resonant excitation and in the absence of dephasing , this emission is purely elastic and coherent  @xcite . as the incident intensity",
    "is raised , this component first grows linearly , but it reaches a maximum at saturation parameter @xmath36 . under strong illumination ,",
    "the population of the excited state undergoes rabi oscillations at frequency @xmath37 and the emitted field is contaminated by an inelastic incoherent component  @xcite .",
    "the coherent part of the resonance fluorescence is predicted to decrease slowly according to the text - book formula @xmath38 , shown by the solid black curve in fig .",

    "the black symbols in fig .",
    "[ coh - incoh ] show the power of the coherent emission of a single molecule , extracted according to the procedure described above .",

    "[ coh - incoh ] show the conventional saturation curve obtained from the fluorescence excitation signal recorded simultaneously on pd2 as a direct measure of the excited state population , also in excellent agreement with the function @xmath47 displayed by the solid red curve .",
    "we note that in our work @xmath48 was determined independently by analyzing the measured linewidths of fluorescence excitation spectra , whereby @xmath49 corresponds to a power broadened fwhm linewidth of @xmath50 .",
    "the coherent part of resonance fluorescence has been previously put to evidence using a heterodyne measurement on the emission of a single ion  @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , a study of its intensity dependence presented in fig .",
    "[ coh - incoh ] has not been reported before .",
    "these measurements are particularly challenging in the solid state because of the omnipresence of background scattering at the excitation wavelength .",
    "the key to success in our experiment has been the efficient coupling of the laser light to the molecule , allowing us to optimize the ratio between the molecular signal and the background scattering .",
    "this is also nicely reflected in the fact that the onset of saturation at @xmath49 could be achieved at the very low incident laser power of 350  pw .",
    "the data in fig .  [ coh - incoh ] clearly show that the coherent resonance fluorescence diminishes under strong excitation .",
    "this means that the interference between the laser beam and the molecular emission is reduced , and the dip in the transmission spectra recorded on pd1 gradually disappears . in parallel to this process , the inelastic component of the resonance fluorescence is expected to increase and give rise to a triplet spectrum as first described by b. mollow in 1969  @xcite .",
    "the so - called mollow triplet has been indeed examined in various gaseous systems  @xcite , but its direct observation has turned out to be elusive in the solid state .    to record and study the incoherent part of the spectrum , we used the detection path in reflection that leads to pd3 in fig .",
    "[ setup]c .",
    "the fluorescence was sent through a short - pass filter to cut out the stokes shifted fluorescence corresponding to the @xmath16 transitions , while transmitting light at @xmath2 and part of the broad phonon wing of the zero phonon line . here",
    "the angle between @xmath20 and that of the molecular dipole was set to @xmath42 and the analyzing polarizer was aligned at @xmath51 , filtering out the background scattering of the laser light with a ratio of 300:1 .",
    "the remaining fluorescence was coupled into a multimode optical fiber with a core diameter of @xmath52 for convenience of handling .",
    "the output of the fiber was sent to a home - built fabry - perot cavity ( fpc ) with a free spectral range of 356  mhz and transmission of approximately @xmath53 . as shown by the lowest spectrum in fig .",
    "[ mollow]a , an instrumental linewidth of about 14  mhz was measured when the reflected laser light was coupled to the resonator . despite polarization filtering of the fluorescence ,",
    "the background laser scattering was of the same order of magnitude as the molecular fluorescence and was exploited for calibrating the frequency axis of each fpc scan .",
    "extracted from the fit ( red curves ) to the @xmath54 data is indicated in each figure together with the corresponding saturation parameter @xmath48 .",
    "[ mollow],width=8 ]    figures  [ mollow]b - h show a series of emission spectra recorded by exciting a molecule on resonance , collecting its fluorescence close to the same wavelength in the fashion described above and then scanning the fpc several times , equivalent to an integration time of 3  s per scan pixel . as the excitation intensity was raised ( moving upward in the figure ) , side bands appeared in the molecular emission spectrum with increasing frequency separations .",
    "the appearance of the mollow triplet can be understood as the result of the periodic modulation of the density matrix elements and thus the molecular polarization at the rabi frequency .    to obtain an independent measure of the rabi frequency , we split the stokes - shifted fluorescence beam on pd2 via a beam splitter onto two photodetectors as sketched in the blue dotted box in fig .",
    "[ setup]c . by using the common start - stop scheme  @xcite , we recorded the intensity correlation function @xmath54  @xcite for each measurement presented in figs .",
    "[ mollow]b - h .",
    "the results are plotted in figs .",
    "[ mollow]j - p .",
    "figure  [ mollow]i confirms that as expected , we observed pure antibunching at low intensities .",
    "however , as the excitation was made stronger , @xmath54 underwent oscillations  @xcite . by fitting the curves in figs .",
    "[ mollow]i - p , we determined the rabi frequencies @xmath37 in each case .",
    "these values together with the corresponding saturation parameters @xmath48 are indicated in figs .",
    "[ mollow]j - p .    using the independently measured values of @xmath37 , the laser background and the fpc line profile ( see fig .",
    "[ mollow]a ) , we then calculated the theoretical spectra for the mollow triplet shown by the red curves in figs .",
    "[ mollow]b - h .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent with only one scaling parameter for the signal intensity . to our knowledge , this constitutes the first observation of the mollow triplet from a single emitter in the solid state , further confirming the potential of these systems for well - understood and controlled quantum optical experiments .",
    ", width=8 ]    commonly a high flux of photons is required in spectroscopy to achieve a single excitation because either the observed transitions are strongly broadened or the light beam is focused very weakly . moreover ,",
    "a certain minimum excitation rate is required to obtain fluorescence count rates larger than the square root of the detector noise level .",
    "a remarkable advantage of coherent detection of single molecules , however , is that the detected intensity can easily be larger than the detector noise even if the molecular emission is much weaker .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ few - photon ] where a single molecule is detected under an incident power of merely 550 photons per second , equivalent to 150 attowatt .",
    "the transmission spectrum shows the raw data integrated over 4 seconds at each pixel . when analyzing this result in the context of an interference phenomenon",
    ", we find that the dip of 50 counts per second originates from a detected molecular emission of only 1.1 photons per second , which is about 10 times lower than the noise associated with the 150 dark counts of our detector .",
    "thus , the high signal contrast of coherent extinction measurements is ideally suited for detecting weak emitters such as single rare earth ions , especially if one would exploit additional improvements in the snr via lock - in detection .",
    "the ability to detect a single emitter with an ultra - faint illumination also shows the feasibility of exciting a single molecule by the emission of a second molecule acting as a source of fourier - limited single photons  @xcite . considering that the fluorescence of a single molecule typically amounts to about @xmath55 detected photons per second",
    ", we can easily expect a few thousands of photons per second at the position of the second molecule after various diagnostics and handling optics .",
    "indeed , calculations show that in the case where an emitter is illuminated by a single photon gaussian wavepacket of width @xmath27 , there is a higher than @xmath56 chance for it to act as a @xmath57-pulse to coherently transfer the population of the ground state to the excited state  @xcite or to experience a substantial phase shift via its interaction with the molecule .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested that the molecule can act as a nonlinear medium to couple two ultra - faint photon fields impinging on it at the same time  @xcite .",
    "by confining a laser beam close to the diffraction limit at t=1.4  k , we have examined for the first time , the _ coherent _ interaction of a single organic molecule with light over 9 orders of magnitude of excitation power . in the weak excitation regime , we have achieved a large extinction dip of @xmath17 and have demonstrated the detection of a single molecule with an ultra - faint laser source of 150 attowatt . in the strong excitation regime ,",
    "our measurements have allowed us to distinguish the coherent and incoherent parts of resonance fluorescence and to study their intensity dependencies .",
    "furthermore , we could directly record the mollow triplet as a landmark of the nonlinear interactions between an emitter and laser light .    from a fundamental point of view ,",
    "an intriguing question that arises is whether one could achieve a perfect coupling between a _",
    "freely _ propagating optical mode and a dipolar emitter in a single - pass encounter , i.e without high - finesse cavities .",
    "when considering the interference nature of the extinction signal , it is clear that the annihilation of a photon in the forward direction requires perfect overlap between its mode and that of a dipolar radiator . clearly , this condition is not satisfied for a strongly focused @xmath58 laser beam  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been proposed that the combination of an emitter with an axially oriented transition dipole moment  @xcite and light with a radially polarized doughnut mode would be favorable  @xcite .",
    "another exciting possibility might be to use nano - antennae for engineering the radiation pattern of the molecule and matching it to the excitation mode  @xcite . given the achievements presented in this article and the simplicity of the sil technology , we anticipate that our approach opens doors to the realization of these ideas and a wide range of other investigations on the coherent and nonlinear interaction of light with single molecules and ions in the condensed phase .",
