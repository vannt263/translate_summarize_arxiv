    "triggered star formation is the process by which star formation is initiated or accelerated through compression of a clump in a molecular cloud by a shock front @xcite .",
    "although a basic understanding of the process of triggered star formation exists , only recently have numerical models becoming sophisticated enough to yield detailed comparisons with observations .",
    "comparison of hydrodynamic shock induced star formation models to observations of potential triggered star formation regions is complicated by the fact that such regions can be very chaotic .",
    "shocks , outflows , and core rotation all have kinematic signatures which may overwhelm the signatures associated with the triggering mechanism @xcite .",
    "in order to alleviate this confusion somewhat , we choose to observe regions of potential small scale triggering .",
    "these regions typically involve one core in a cometary cloud , and a well defined shock front geometry .",
    "several numerical studies of shock triggered collapse have been undertaken recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vc ) .",
    "these studies have found that shocks with velocities less than 45 km s@xmath4 can cause cores to collapse , but fast shocks ( @xmath5 km s@xmath4 ) tend to destroy the principal cooling molecules , leading ultimately to the destruction of the cloud",
    ". these models also yield an appreciable number of binary and multiple star systems , which are common in our galaxy , yet difficult to form by spontaneous , isolated star formation .",
    "the vc models tend to reproduce characteristics of observed cometary clouds thought to be small scale triggered star formation regions @xcite .",
    "this comparison between the models and the observations will be explored further in a forthcoming paper .    in order to perform a detailed study of sites of triggered star formation , which can be compared to models",
    ", we conducted a survey of bright rimmed clouds identified by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , sfo ) . these are all molecular clouds which border expanding hii regions . at the boundary between the ionized gas within the stromgren sphere , and the molecular cloud",
    "is an ionization front , which shows up as the bright rim identified by sfo .",
    "embedded near the rim , and just within the molecular cloud in each of these sources is an iras source .",
    "the fact that the ionization front is collecting gas into a ridge or core in many of these sources makes them excellent candidates for the globule squeezing or collect and collapse mode of triggered star formation @xcite .",
    "these clouds are also divided into three morphological types , shown schematically in figure  [ schematic ] .",
    "the first is type  a , which has a moderately curved rim , and looks much like a shield in three dimensions .",
    "the second is type  b , which has a more tightly curved rim near the head of the cloud , but which tends to broaden near the tail .",
    "type  b is also known as an elephant trunk morphology .",
    "the third is type  c which has a very tightly curved rim and a well defined tail .",
    "type  c is often called a cometary cloud .",
    "the shock induced collapse models of vc as well as observations of the expanding ionization front of the orion ob 1 association @xcite suggest that these morphological types of bright rimmed clouds may actually be a time evolution sequence with clouds evolving from type  a through type  b to type  c.",
    "potential triggered star formation regions have been selected from the catalog of bright - rimmed clouds with associated iras point sources by sfo .",
    "each of these sources is associated with an hii region and is suspected to be forming stars via triggering . in all of these sources the geometry of the incoming shock region is obvious , as the shock emanates from the interface of the cloud and hii region .",
    "since there are three different morphologies , or bright rim cloud types , we decided to chose at least two of each type .",
    "we also chose nearby sources , both to get the best possible resolution , and because most bok globules that have been studied have been nearby objects .",
    "the bright rimmed clouds we observed have distances between 190 and 1900 pc , and include two type  a bright rimmed clouds ( sfo  16 and sfo  18 ) , three type  b bright rimmed clouds ( sfo  4 , sfo  13 , and sfo  25 ) , and two type  c bright rimmed clouds ( sfo  20 and sfo  37 ) .",
    "we can not hope to resolve the cores of the more distant sources with single dish millimeter or submillimeter observations , however we do resolve the structure of the swept up molecular gas cloud surrounding the core , which is greatly affected by the impacting ionization front .",
    "the embedded iras sources in the selected bright rimmed clouds have infrared luminosities which range from 5 to 1300 @xmath6 , though all but one of the sources have a luminosity less that 110 @xmath6 .",
    "these luminosities tend to be typical of low or intermediate mass star formation .",
    "finally all but one of the bright rimmed clouds were chosen to have the iras colors of their embedded iras point source be consistent with young stellar objects ( ysos ) according to the color criteria presented in @xcite .",
    "there are two exceptions to this rule .",
    "the first , sfo  4 , was chosen because it is exceptionally nearby ( 190 pc ) .",
    "the second , sfo  13 , was chosen because it is thought to be a region of cluster formation @xcite .",
    "although sfo  4 and sfo  13 do not meet the iras color criteria of @xcite for inclusion in the population of ysos , they do meet the criteria of @xcite for embedded star forming regions .",
    "digitized sky survey observations of the bright rimmed clouds are shown in figure  [ sfo_dss ] . in",
    "most of the optical images the bright rim is clearly visible , enclosed within the rim is the molecular cloud .",
    "several of the sources show high extinction on one side of the rim indicating the presence of the molecular cloud .",
    "we have drawn in an arrow indicating the direction of propagation of the ionization front from the ionizing source creating the hii region .    in order to compare potential triggered star formation regions with quiescent star formation regions , we also observed bok globules with embedded iras sources in their cores from the @xcite catalog of small , optically selected molecular clouds .",
    "we chose bok globules with properties that are similar to our bright rimmed clouds .",
    "they lie at distances between 250 and 2500 pc from us .",
    "they are believed to contain one star forming core with an embedded iras source , and their luminosities between 3 and 930 @xmath6 .",
    "observations of these sources allow for detailed comparisons between the observed properties of triggered and spontaneous star formation regions , and will allow us to isolate those observed properties unique to triggered star formation .",
    "the three bok globules we have observed are b335 , cb  3 , and cb  224 .",
    "the source list is summarized in table  [ sources ] .",
    "one can not obtain a complete picture of the physical conditions in a star forming cloud by observing one molecular line .",
    "it is only by combining observations of several molecular line transitions , sensitive to various physical conditions , that one can approach an accurate physical representation of the star forming cloud . as a result we chose several molecular transitions , in both the millimeter and submillimeter wave bands , in order to probe the conditions we felt",
    "would provide us with a basis for comparing bright rimmed clouds with bok globules .",
    "the transitions we observed are summarized in table  [ transitions ] .",
    "co has traditionally been the main tracer of molecular clouds .",
    "it has a fairly high abundance and a low critical density , making it a very useful tracer of molecular gas .",
    "our observations of co were driven by the fact that both the co  ( ) and the co  ( ) emission are good tracers of molecular outflows .",
    "hco@xmath1is a good tracer of moderate density ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we observe the millimeter hco@xmath1  ( ) line to trace the morphology of the molecular gas swept up by the ionization front .",
    "the submillimeter hco@xmath1  ( ) and hco@xmath1  ( ) trace the denser clumps within the swept up gas .",
    "hco@xmath1emission in all three tracers tends to be optically thick in the cores , making it a good tracer of infall as discussed in ",
    "[ infall ] .",
    "n@xmath3h@xmath1  has been shown to be a good tracer of the dense core material as it can only form in well - shielded regions @xcite .",
    "n@xmath3h@xmath1  also remains relatively undepleated in cores @xcite , making it especially useful in probing the densest regions of star forming clouds .",
    "the n@xmath3h@xmath1  ( ) transition has seven well measured hyperfine components resulting from the interaction of the molecular electric field gradient and the electric quadrupole moments of the nitrogen nuclei @xcite .",
    "these components can be used to determine the optical depth of n@xmath3h@xmath1  from which we can derive the column density of n@xmath3h@xmath1 . from this measurement",
    "we can infer the density of star forming cores .      in  [ results ] we will discuss our observations of each source in a systematic way .",
    "this section describes the order in which various observations will be described and also points out various features which we look for in these sources . for each source we present figures illustrating the line profiles at the iras source position , an integrated intensity map of each tracer which we mapped , a map of the centroid velocity of the hco@xmath1  ( ) transition , and a map of the molecular outflow if one is detected .",
    "our rationale for presenting these figures is discussed below .",
    "we begin by presenting the central line profiles of all the observed molecular transitions .",
    "these profiles are taken at the position of the iras source .",
    "there are several features in the line profiles which are of interest to us .",
    "the co lines often have broad low intensity features called wings .",
    "these wings , which are especially prominent in the co  ( ) transition , are usually the result of an outflow from the forming protostellar object",
    ". these outflows are often bipolar and are thought to arise from megnetohydrodynamic winds driven by infall and interaction with the forming star s surrounding disk ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the shape of the line profile can also be of interest .",
    "the hco@xmath1  transitions often have profiles which deviate significantly from gaussian shapes at line center .",
    "this is due to the high optical depth which results in self - absorption near the line center .",
    "often this results in a profile with two distinct peaks .",
    "when this is indeed the result of self - absorption , the lower abundance h@xmath2co@xmath1  lines are often still optically thin and tends to show their greatest intensity at a velocity between the twin peaks of their self - absorbed isotopomer hco@xmath1 .",
    "the relative size of each peak often indicates the kinematics of the gas within the beam .",
    "when the gas is collapsing to a point within the beam , the red - shifted gas is preferentially self - absorbed leaving a more intense blue - shifted peak and an overall blue - asymmetry with respect to the h@xmath2co@xmath1  line .",
    "the reverse is true for gas expanding from a point within a beam @xcite .",
    "the integrated intensity maps provide a look at the two - dimensional morphology of the molecular cloud and cores as seen by the different tracers we mapped over the region surrounding the iras sources .",
    "the co integrated intensity map gives a global look at the molecular gas in the region .",
    "one thing to note in the bright rimmed clouds we observe is that the boundary between the molecular cloud and the ionized gas is very sharp and well traced by the co. the hco@xmath1tends to trace denser regions , but is also excited by shocks @xcite . as a result hco@xmath1  ( ) tends to trace both the star forming cores as well as the rim of the ionization front .",
    "the higher level hco@xmath1  transitions tend to trace the dense gas .",
    "we overlay the n@xmath3h@xmath1  half - power contour on the integrated intensity map of a higher level hco@xmath1  transition in order to show the correspondence between the dense gas traced by n@xmath3h@xmath1  and that traced by hco@xmath1 .",
    "there is often good agreement between the two tracers . following the integrated intensity maps we present hco@xmath1  ( ) centroid velocity maps for most of the sources .",
    "centroid velocity maps have been shown to be very effective in disentangling the underlying velocity fields in regions of complex kinematics @xcite .",
    "often there is a velocity gradient which may correspond to rotation of the cloud or be a result of acceleration of the molecular gas due to the rocket effect which arises at the molecular cloud boundary .",
    "the kinematic signature suggested by the hco@xmath1  is often interesting when compared to the integrated intensity maps of the co outflows , which we present next for many of the sources we observe .",
    "often the bipolar outflow we detect in co is perpendicular to the velocity gradient we detect in hco@xmath1 .",
    "this is evidence that we may be detecting rotation along the direction predicted in current models of star formation .",
    "we do not have the angular resolution , however , to probe this rotation down to the small scales of the star forming core .",
    "we performed observations at the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) 14  m telescope over the 19992000 and 20002001 observing seasons using the second quabbin observatory imaging array ( sequoia ) 16-beam array receiver , and the focal plane array autocorrelation spectrometers ( faas ) which consists of 16 autocorrelating spectrometers .",
    "a summary of the observed molecular line transitions is shown in table  [ transitions ] .",
    "the c@xmath0o , hco@xmath1 , h@xmath2co@xmath1 , and n@xmath3h@xmath1  transitions were observed using the frequency - switched mode , while co was observed by position switching to a region that was reasonably clear of co emission , though some co contamination was found and considered acceptable in the offset positions as long as it was well separated in velocity from the line of interest .",
    "the hco@xmath1and h@xmath2co@xmath1  were frequency folded and 3@xmath8 order baselines were removed , while for the n@xmath3h@xmath1  data a 4@xmath9 order baseline was used .",
    "a 2@xmath10 order baseline was subtracted from the position - switched co data .",
    "hco@xmath1  and n@xmath3h@xmath1were mapped with half - beam spacing , while co and h@xmath2co@xmath1  were mapped with full - beam spacing .",
    "the extent of the region mapped varies depending on the spatial extent of the source s emission .",
    "we also performed submillimeter observations in april and december 2000 and in april 2001 with the 10  m heinrich hertz telescope ( hht ) .",
    "co , hco@xmath1 , and h@xmath2co@xmath1 observations were conducted using the facility 230 ghz sis receiver , while hco@xmath1  and h@xmath2co@xmath1  observations were conducted using the facility dual polarization 345 ghz sis receiver .",
    "several backends were used simultaneously , including a 1 ghz wide ( @xmath11 mhz resolution ) acousto - optical spectrometer ( aos ) , and three filterbanks with 1 mhz , 250 khz , and 62.5 khz resolutions .",
    "the results presented in this paper were processed using the 250 khz filterbank .",
    "all observations were position - switched , and second order baselines were removed .",
    "h@xmath2co@xmath1  observations were made of the star forming core at the iras source position , while hco@xmath1  and co observations were made using the on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping technique .",
    "observations of @xmath12 regions in otf mode were combined into maps of various spatial extents depending on the source .",
    "we observed b335 in may of 1996 at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "hco@xmath1  ( )",
    "mapping was performed using the otf mapping technique .",
    "the otf data was gridded into 49 positions with a spacing of 10 .",
    "h@xmath2co@xmath1  ( ) was observed at the iras source position .",
    "all observations were carried out with low - noise sis waveguide receivers and a 1000 channel , 50 mhz wide acousto - optical spectrometer . the main beam efficiency at 345 ghz is @xmath13 .",

    "sfo  4 is a bright rimmed cloud with a type  b morphology on the edge of the hii region s185 ( @xmath14 cas ) ( sfo ) .",
    "iras source 00560 + 6037 is embedded within sfo  4 .",
    "this iras source has been classified by sfo as having iras colors consistent with hot cirrus sources , and not a forming or newly formed star ( sfo ) .",
    "however according to the criteria of @xcite sfo  4 fits the iras color profile of an embedded star forming region .",
    "sfo  4 is nearby ( 190 pc ) , and has no known associated outflows or hh objects .    figure  [ sfoiv_xiii_profiles]a shows the spectra of our observations towards the iras source in sfo  4 . although h@xmath2co@xmath1  ( ) was not detected , our observations limit the integrated intensity of that transition to less that 0.037  k  km  s@xmath4 . based on this limit , and the integrated intensity measurement of hco@xmath1  ( ) , and an assumed c/@xmath2c abundance ratio of 64 we derive an upper limit to the column density of hco@xmath1  to be @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "the line profiles appear fairly gaussian , in all the observed transitions , with nearly identical centroid velocities .",
    "none of the isotopic lines of either co or hco@xmath1  were detected .",
    "figure  [ sfoiv_itty ] shows the hco@xmath1  and co integrated intensity maps . neither the co ( ) map , nor the hco@xmath1  maps show much structure . in the co ( )",
    "map and the hco@xmath1  ( ) map the cloud core surrounding the embedded iras source is visible , but no gas traces the ionization front or the elephant trunk morphology seen in the dss image in figure  [ sfo_dss ] .",
    "the hco@xmath1  ( ) map shows only one point whose integrated intensity is above 1.0 k , the three sigma threshold for the map .",
    "this source is unusually weak compared to the other sources in the sample , which is unfortunate as it is also the most nearby source in the sample .",
    "sfo  13 is classified as a type  b bright rimmed cloud by sfo .",
    "figure  [ sfo_dss ] shows the elephant trunk morphology characteristic of type  b clouds .",
    "the initially cometary head of the cloud broadens into a wider structure as one follows the cloud away from the ionizing source .",
    "sfo  13 borders the hii region ic1848 , and lies at a distance of 1.9 kpc from us , making it the most distant sfo source in the sample .",
    "a recent near - infrared survey reveals @xmath17 point sources whose spectral energy distributions are consistent with pre - main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 band observations by @xcite also confirm the presence an embedded stellar cluster in this molecular cloud .",
    "these sources are distributed preferentially towards the hii region with respect to the iras source , and are probably older than the iras source indicating that this cloud may be an example of small scale sequential star formation .",
    "the millimeter and submillimeter line profiles for sfo  13 , shown in figure  [ sfoiv_xiii_profiles]b , are all fairly gaussian and also peak at approximately the same velocity .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected as the average infall region for individual cores in a star formation region is smaller than the fcrao beamwidth , which is 0.5  pc at this distance , and the hht beamwidth , of 0.3  pc , making it difficult to detect infall .",
    "the co  ( ) line strength is almost twice as much as that of co  ( ) . this intensity difference may be due to excitation effects , but may also be the result of the small angular size of the core .",
    "since the co  ( ) transition is observed with a much smaller beam than the co  ( ) transition , the beam dilution is much greater for the lower transition and can have significant effects on the intensities observed with such distant sources . the hco@xmath1  and c@xmath0oline profiles are all fairly gaussian .",
    "n@xmath3h@xmath1  ( ) was not detected in this source , down to an rms level of 0.017 k  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "although the spatial resolution of our observations are not good enough to trace individual infall regions , the overall gas morphology is resolved by the beam .",
    "figure  [ sfoxiii_itty ] shows integrated intensity maps of various transitions and isotopes of co and hco@xmath1 . the co  ( ) shows a distinct head , located at the iras source position upon which the map is centered .",
    "lower intensity co  ( ) emission continues from the core and spreads out to the north - east of the image , similar to the elephant trunk morphology seen in the optical ( figure  [ sfo_dss ] ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the ionizing source is located to the south - west of the core .",
    "the region mapped in co ( ) shows a similar morphology to the co ( ) emission , however the core position is much more intense than the surrounding gas .",
    "the c@xmath0o  ( ) map shows emission mostly north of the hco@xmath1  core , with very little north - east extension .",
    "this indicates that the large column density molecular gas may not correspond exactly with the star forming core in this source .",
    "the hco@xmath1  ( ) integrated intensity map ( figure  [ sfoxiii_itty ] ) shows a more cometary morphology than the digitized sky survey image in figure  [ sfo_dss ] .",
    "the dense gas appears to be preferentially located along a ridge near the southern edge of the cloud .",
    "this could be a result of the preexisting density structure of the molecular cloud which was swept up by the ionization front or an effect of the geometry of the expanding hii region .",
    "however , these observations can not determine how the gas was swept into that ridge .",
    "the hco@xmath1  ( ) integrated intensity map only shows significant emission at the position of the star forming core . the hco@xmath1  ( ) centroid map ( figure  [ sfoxiii_centroid ] ) does not show a very coherent structure",
    ", however there is a significant velocity gradient across the tail in the hco@xmath1  ( ) map along the northwest - southeast direction .",
    "the co  ( ) line profiles show distinct wings , which seem to form two lobes of an outflow ( figure  [ sfoxiii_outflow ] ) .",
    "this outflow has not previously been observed , although sfo found line wings indicative of an outflow in their co  ( ) observation of this source .",
    "sfo  16 , also known as l1634 and rno40 , is classified as a type  a bright rimmed cloud by sfo , as it is a broad ionization front , with no tail .",
    "sfo  16 borders barnard s loop , and is at a distance of 400 pc .",

    "the c@xmath0o  ( ) line , however appears to have a fairly gaussian shape .",
    "the hco@xmath1  line profiles , shown in figure  [ sfoxvi_xviii_profiles]a , are a bit more enigmatic .",
    "the hco@xmath1  ( ) and h@xmath2co@xmath1  ( ) lines seem fairly well centered on the @xmath21 , but the hco@xmath1  ( ) shows a pronounced asymmetry .",
    "this asymmetric profile is not shared by the h@xmath2co@xmath1  ( ) line , indicating that the asymmetry observed in the hco@xmath1  line is probably the result of a radiative transfer effect , and not an effect of the superposition of clouds along the line of sight .",
    "line asymmetries can be produced by infall @xcite , however this produces a line which has greater emission blue - shifted from line center , and our example is red - shifted from line center .",
    "it is possible that the hco@xmath1  ( ) profile is caused by an outflow .",
    "another possibility is that this red - asymmetric profile is due to infall in a region where the shock heating has inverted the excitation temperature profile of the infalling gas , so that is has a higher excitation temperature far from the core and a lower excitation temperature near the core .",
    "this hypothesis will be fully explored in  [ infall ] .",
    "the co and hco@xmath1  integrated intensity maps are shown in figure  [ sfoxvi_itty ] .",
    "although classified as a type  a cloud by sfo , the co  ( ) seems to show a well defined tail moving off to the south - west , however the ionization source is located directly to the east of the core .",
    "the c@xmath0o  ( ) integrated intensity map ( figure  [ sfoxvi_itty ] ) shows the molecular core surrounding the iras source , and no evidence of the outflow lobes .",
    "it does appear that there is a tail traced by the c@xmath0o  elongated to the west of the core .",
    "the hco@xmath1  ( ) integrated intensity image in figure  [ sfoxvi_itty ] is more indicative of a type  a morphology that the co integrated intensity maps .",
    "the majority of the gas traced by the hco@xmath1  emission is in a fairly broad regions which is densest around the iras core , but shows another possible core 300  north of the iras core .",
    "the hco@xmath1  ( ) integrated intensity map highlights the location of the core .",
    "figure  [ sfoxvi_centroid ] shows the centroid velocity of the hco@xmath1  ( ) emission in the dense regions of the source .",
    "this centroid was calculated over the line core velocities , and do not include contributions from line wings if they are present . on average",
    "there appears to be a north - south velocity gradient which could indicate rotation of the cloud .    in both the co  ( ) and",
    "co  ( ) integrated intensity maps , lobes indicative of a bipolar outflow are evident . figure  [ sfoxvi_outflow ] shows an integrated intensity map of the co  ( ) line wings .",
    "this figure shows that there is an outflow , with the blue shifted lobe on the west side of the core and the red shifted lobe to the east of the core .",
    "previous studies by @xcite and @xcite indicate the presence of this outflow and a second outflow , which we do not detect , aligned in the northwest - southeast direction .",
    "the axis of rotation , derived from the hco@xmath1  centroid map , is aligned east - west , matching the alignment of outflow we detect .",
    "this alignment is predicted by current star formation theories that posit that outflows are located along the polar direction of a rotating protostar , in order to shed some angular momentum before material can fall into the protostar .",
    "sfo  18 , also known as b35a , is also a type  a bright rimmed cloud .",
    "it borders the hii region @xmath22 ori at a distance of about 400 pc .",

    "@xcite have detected an outflow in co  ( ) which extends in the northwest - southeast direction around the embedded iras source .",
    "our line profiles shown in figure  [ sfoxvi_xviii_profiles]b show bright , extensive wings on the co  ( ) line , when compared to its c@xmath0o   counterpart .",
    "the hco@xmath1  ( ) and hco@xmath1  ( ) line profiles both show a significant blue asymmetry when compared to their h@xmath2co@xmath1  isotopic counterparts .",
    "this may indicate that the gas is infalling around the core or cores @xcite .",
    "the co   integrated intensity map ( figure  [ sfoxviii_itty ] ) shows the broad ionization front with a core at its apex , typical of type  a sources .",
    "the co emission cuts off fairly abruptly on the western edge of the cloud , where the ionization front is located .",
    "the ionizing source is located directly to the west of the core . besides the increased emission at the core",
    ", one can see a general increase in co  ( ) emission adjacent to the ionization front which is probably due to an increase in column density as gas gets swept up by the ionization front , a factor which ultimately enhances the density and leads to self - gravitating clumps @xcite .",
    "the c@xmath0o  ( ) better traces the high column density gas around the core and shows what may be another core to the northeast of the first .",
    "the hco@xmath1  ( ) emission better traces the dense ridge , as seen in the integrated intensity map in figure  [ sfoxviii_itty ] , and the core in which the iras source is embedded .",
    "this ridge of dense gas is consistent with the type  a morphological classification by .",
    "higher resolution hco@xmath1  ( ) observations of the core show several emission peaks , indicating that there may be several low mass stars forming simultaneously in that region .",
    "this is consistent with models of shock driven collapse @xcite in which multiple stars can be formed .",

    "however , in the case of shock triggered regions , the ionization front does dissipate some of the angular momentum of the collapsing cloud @xcite , though the ionization front would probably not have a noticeable effect on the scale of the accretion disk .",
    "we have analyzed the energy in the detected outflows and present the results in table  [ outflowtable ] .",
    "we derived the mass of the lobes by averaging the integrated intensity of the line - wing emission over the spatial extend of the lobe .",
    "we then derived a column density from this integrated intensity assuming that the emission is optically thin and an excitation temperature of 30k .",

    "the dynamical age ( @xmath32 ) of the flow is found by calculating the distance from the core to the edge of the outflow lobe and dividing by @xmath31 , while the kinetic luminosity ( @xmath33 ) is derived by deviding the kinetic energy of the lobe by the dynamical age of the flow .",
    "the dynamical ages and kinetic luminosities of these outflows tend to agree with those of previously observed outflow sources @xcite .",
    "the outflow ages all tend to be greater than @xmath34 years , which may indicate that the embedded objects are class  i sources rather than class  0 sources , which typically have outflow ages less than @xmath34 years @xcite .",
    "we compare the mechanical luminosity and force needed to accelerate the outflow to the luminosity and radiant pressure of the iras source driving the outflow in figure  [ outflow ] .",
    "we find that the bright rimmed clouds occupy similar regions in the two plots indicating that they are probably driven by similar processes as the other outflows around forming stars that have been observed to date .",
    "we find that the embedded iras source has sufficient energy to drive the outflows we observe , but that the radiant pressure of the iras source is not sufficient to accelerate the outflows to the velocities we observe .",
    "this confirms similar observations of @xcite .",
    "although several outflows were detected , and the presence of outflows implies infalling gas , there were few line asymmetries indicative of infall in the bright rimmed clouds .",
    "@xcite have defined a parameter to quantify the line asymmetry in terms of the line center velocity of an optically thick line , the line center velocity of an optically thin line , and the width of the optically thin line .",
    "the asymmetry ( @xmath35 ) is then defined as @xmath36 @xcite find the line center velocities of both the thick and thin lines by fitting a gaussian to the lines , however this does not yield a very robust estimator of the asymmetry in my opinion . as the optical depth increases",

    "we see that the bright rimmed clouds show asymmetry values comparable to those of other star forming regions .",
    "the bright rimmed clouds , however , do not show as wide a deviation of asymmetry values , and tend to have @xmath35s which are closer to 0 than typical star formation regions , whose @xmath35s tend to be negative .",
    "a wider survey of bright rimmed clouds is required to determine if they indeed have significantly less blue excess than other ysos .",
    "why do we not detect infall in more bright rimmed clouds ?",
    "does the incoming shock front produce conditions that alter the shape of the emergent line profile ?",
    "an isolated bok globule usually has an excitation temperature profile which drops from a value on the order of 2050k at the core center to 10k at the edge of the core .",
    "bright rimmed clouds , however , are stripped of their molecular envelopes and heated by uv flux from o stars .",
    "this may be expected to flatten or in some cases invert the temperature profile , so that the cloud core center may still have a physical temperature around 20k , but the edge of the cloud core may have a physical temperature of several hundred k. since the gas throughout the core is fairly excited , it would eliminate the self - absorption which characterizes the blue line asymmetry typically associated with infall .",
    "this inversion of the excitation temperature gradient could even lead to absorption of the blue - shifted gas by denser , yet less excited gas closer to the core .",
    "figure  [ lteinfall ] illustrates the effect of inverting the temperature gradient on a free - falling infall region . the model presented in that figure is a collapsing region , with a peak density of @xmath43   which drops down to a density of @xmath44   near the edge of the beam .",
    "the infall region is confined to an area which is roughly 50% of the beam size .",
    "we assume a free - fall collapse models , with infall velocities increasing towards the center of the collapsing sphere .",
    "the only difference between the model which generates the double peaked solid line and the single peaked dashed line is the temperature gradient across the infalling region .",
    "the solid line is the result of a linear temperature gradient which peaks in the center at 40  k and drops off towards the edge of our beam to 10  k. the dashed line also is a linear temperature gradient , but the temperature increases from 40  k at the center of the sphere to 300  k at the outer edge .",
    "the approximates more closely the behavior of infalling gas clouds under the influence of wind - triggered collapse as modeled by vc .",
    "our model shows that heating of the envelope of a collapsing cloud can lessen or remove entirely the blue - asymmetric line signature of a collapsing molecular cloud .    in order to test the assumption that the ionization front may be raising the excitation temperature near the edge of the cloud ,",
    "we have smoothed the hco@xmath1  ( ) map to the same resolution as the hco@xmath1  ( ) in both a bright rimmed cloud ( sfo  25 ) and a bok globule ( cb  3 ) which we observed .",
    "we assume thermodynamic equilibrium between these transitions , as well as a low optical depth in order to derive the excitation temperature across the core .",
    "sfo  25 has fairly gaussian lines , centered at the same velocity as their isotopic counterparts , indicating that the hco@xmath1  emission for this source may be optically thin . in cb  3 , as in all the bok globules we observed , we know the hco@xmath1  emission is not optically thin , however this would tend to wash out the excitation temperature to the cloud core , so in regions where the emission is optically thick we can consider the derived excitation temperature to be a lower limit . towards the edge of the cb  3 core the hco@xmath1emission does become optically thin making this a good assumption . in the case of sfo  25",
    "we derive the excitation temperature along a line which cuts through both the ionization front and the star forming core , and plot that excitation temperature profile in figure  [ texprofiles]a .",
    "the center ( 0 ) offset represents the star forming core position , and the ionization front is in the negative direction . figure  [ texprofiles]b shows the excitation temperature profile around the core of cb  3 , however we averaged annuli around the central core in order to derive the plotted values , rather than take a cut straight across in order to maximize our signal to noise ratio . in the case of sfo  25 , the excitation temperature peaks near the edge of the cloud core , while in cb  3 the excitation temperature peaks near the center .",
    "although it is likely that the cores of these bright rimmed clouds are collapsing in a similar manner to other class  0 or class  i sources , the heating due to the nearby hii region may dampen their spectral line infall signature .",
    "our observations constitute the first detailed millimeter and submillimeter multitransition study of bright rimmed clouds . among the 7 bright rimmed clouds we observe ,",
    "6 seem to share traits similar with other low to intermediate mass star forming regions .",
    "our analysis of these bright rimmed clouds has yielded the principal results that follow .    1 .   new fcrao co  ( ) , c@xmath0o  ( ) , hco@xmath1  ( ) , h@xmath2co@xmath1  ( ) , and n@xmath3h@xmath1  ( ) observations along with new hht co  ( ) , hco@xmath1  ( ) , hco@xmath1  ( ) , h@xmath2co@xmath1  ( ) , and h@xmath2co@xmath1  ( ) observations of 7 bright rimmed clouds and 3 bok globules were presented .",
    "these observations constitute the most detailed millimeter and submillimeter study of bright rimmed clouds to date .",
    "2 .   the millimeter co and hco@xmath1  emission tends to terminate abruptly at the ionization front . as a result , the overall morphology of the co and hco@xmath1 millimeter integrated intensity maps are similar with the optical morphologies identified by sfo .",
    "3 .   the millimeter hco@xmath1  tends to show the dense swept up ridge behind the ionization front , as well as the star forming core around the embedded iras source . in some of the bright rimmed clouds the hco@xmath1  ( ) emission also traces other overdense clumps which may later be triggered to collapse by the ionization front , resulting in sequential star formation .",
    "the millimeter and submillimeter hco@xmath1  lines from many of the bright rimmed clouds appear nearly gaussian , with little evidence of infall asymmetry .",
    "the only exceptions to this are sfo  18 , which shows significant blue asymmetry , and sfo  16 which shows a slight red asymmetry relative to optically thin tracers .",
    "the core masses derived for the bright rimmed clouds using both n@xmath3h@xmath1 and hco@xmath1  are typical for low and intermediate mass star formation regions . the n@xmath3h@xmath1  and hco@xmath1  results also tend to agree to within an order of magnitude .",
    "the overall blue excess of the sample of bright rimmed clouds is slightly less than that of the class  0 and class  i sources observed by @xcite and @xcite , though the small number of bright rimmed clouds we observed does not make this difference statistically significant . a larger survey of bright rimmed clouds is required to determine if this is a significant finding .",
    "we do however make a case for the fact that the heating of the collapsing cloud by the adjacent hii region could dampen the infall signature , lowering the blue excess of bright rimmed clouds . 7 .",
    "we observed outflows around 5 of the 7 bright rimmed clouds , including new detections of outflows around sfo  13 and sfo  25 .",
    "these outflows appear to have similar properties to other outflows detected in millimeter and submillimeter emission .",
    "we do not see direct evidence of triggering in these sources",
    ". we can not determine if star formation was induced in these clouds or if we are seeing the collapse of pre - existing clumps .",
    "we do know that the environment has a profound effect on these regions .",
    "although we have found similarities and differences between bok globules and bright rimmed clouds , a detailed understanding of the effects of an ionization front on star formation can only be achieved by theoretically modeling this process , and then comparing that model to observations . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will compare these observations with models of shock driven collapse derived by vc .",
    "in addition to bright rimmed clouds , these models could explain the effect of outflows and other environmental effects on star formation .",
    "development of the techniques and models which will help us understand star formation in complex environments is in progress .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the staff of the hht for their excellent support .",
    "in particular we wish to thank harold butner for his assistance with setting up our otf observations at the hht and mark heyer for his many helpful comments . c. h. de vries and g. narayanan are supported by the fcrao under the national science foundation grant ast 01 - 00793 .",
