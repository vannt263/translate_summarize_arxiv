    "supersymmetric models where the gravitino ( @xmath0 ) is the lightest supersymmetric particle have been considered in the literature for some time @xcite .",
    "more recently they have enjoyed a resurgence motivated by new models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking @xcite and by possible explanations @xcite of the puzzling cdf @xmath14 event @xcite .",
    "most of the recent effort has been devoted to studying the new signals for supersymmetry via electroweak - interaction processes , that accompany such scenarios by virtue of the newly allowed @xmath15 decay ( _ i.e. _ , diphoton signals from @xmath16 and analogous signals in @xmath17 production of a variety of supersymmetric channels ) @xcite , or via direct gravitino production ( _ i.e. _ , single photon signals from @xmath18 @xcite or @xmath19 @xcite ) .",
    "much less emphasis has been placed on strong - interaction processes at hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "an important part of this phenomenological effort should be directed at obtaining direct experimental information on the gravitino mass . however , this information will not come from the kinematical effects of such a very light particle , but instead from the dynamical effect that each interaction vertex involving gravitinos is inversely proportional to the gravitino mass .",
    "lower bounds on the gravitino mass from single - photon searches at lep already exist , but are limited by kinematics at lep  1 @xcite and by dynamics at lep  2 @xcite .",
    "limits on the gravitino mass based on monojet and multijet final states at the tevatron require that the scalar partners of the goldstino ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) in spontaneously broken susy models are very light@xcite .",
    "limits also exist from astrophysical and cosmological considerations@xcite , although , as noted in ref.@xcite , these limits are competitive with collider limits only if one again assumes that the scalar partners of the goldstino are very light .",

    "the gravitation - induced contributions dominate the supersymmetric - qcd ones , otherwise the reverse is true .",
    "this process is also kinematically constrained at the tevatron to @xmath28 .",
    "the second process ( @xmath29 ) only receives contributions from gravitation - induced diagrams and is therefore only relevant for sufficiently light gravitino masses .",
    "however , its kinematical reach at the tevatron is much greater ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we find that for sufficiently light gravitinos ( @xmath31 ) ev , the second process has a larger cross section even within the kinematical reach of the first process ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "it is also important to consider the gluino decay modes . for sufficiently light gravitinos ( @xmath27 @xcite )",
    "these are dominated by @xmath33 ; otherwise they proceed in complicated ways of which @xmath34 is an example .",
    "we then obtain a partitioning of the @xmath35 ) space into four regions of  low / high \" values of the parameters , roughly delimited by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
