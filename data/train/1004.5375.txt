    "in refs . for the dirac - yang - mills system derived from qcd - lagrangian an unique family of compatible nonperturbative solutions was found and explored , which could pretend to decsribing confinement of two quarks .",
    "the successful applications of the family to the description of both the heavy quarkonia spectra and a number of properties of pions , kaons , @xmath0 and @xmath1-meson showed that the confinement mechanism is qualitatively the same for both light mesons and heavy quarkonia and it is mainly governed by the magnetic colour field linear in @xmath2 ( distance between quarks ) which represents a part of the mentioned unique family of solutions and , in its turn , the part is a solution of the su(3)-yang - mills equations .    as has been emphasized , however , as far back as in refs .",
    ", the similar unique confining solutions exist for any compact semisimple and non - semisimple lie groups , in particular , for su@xmath3-groups with @xmath4 and for u@xmath3-groups with @xmath5 , i.e. it holds true also for classical electrodynamics with group u@xmath6 and maxwell equations . under this situation , as was pointed out in refs .",
    ", there is an interesting possibility of indirect experimental verification of the confinement mechanism under discussion . indeed the confining solutions of maxwell equations for classical electrodynamics point out the confinement phase could be in electrodynamics as well . though there exist no elementary charged particles generating a constant magnetic field linear in @xmath2 , the distance from particle , after all , if it could generate this elecromagnetic field configuration in laboratory then one might study motion of the charged particles in that field",
    ". the confining properties of the mentioned field should be displayed at classical level too but the exact behaviour of particles in this field requires certain analysis of the corresponding classical equations of motion .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to some degree to realize the above program on studying motion of the charged particles in the mentioned confining electromagnetic field .",
    "section 2 contains preliminaries necessary to pose the problem : information on the confining solutions of the yang - mills and maxwell equations and on the miscellaneous forms of the motion equations for a charged particle in the confining magnetic field when considering it with using different curvilinear coordinates .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the general conclusions of a qualitative character concerning behaviour of a charged particle in the magnetic field under discussion . in the strong field limit section 4",
    "gives asymptotical expansions for the spherical coordinates of a particle when its moving in the field under consideration while section 5 contains numerical estimates and section 6 is devoted to discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "appendix a is devoted to the formulation of vector analysis on a region @xmath7 in @xmath8 which is most convenient , especially while working with using the arbitrary curvilinear coordinates so the mentioned formulation is employed throughout the paper . at last , appendix b supplements section 2 with a proof of the uniqueness theorem from that section in the case of u(1)-group ( maxwell equations ) .",
    "also throughout the paper we employ the heaviside - lorentz system of units with @xmath9 and also with the boltzmann constant @xmath10 , unless explicitly stated otherwise . when calculating we apply the relations @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "as was mentioned above , our study is motivated by the confinement mechanism proposed earlier by one of the authors and based on the unique family of compatible nonperturbative solutions for the dirac - yang - mills system ( derived from qcd - lagrangian ) studied at the whole length in refs . .",
    "one part of the mentioned family is presented by the unique nonperturbative confining solution of the su(3)-yang - mills equations for gluonic field @xmath15 ( @xmath16 are the known gell - mann matrices , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) . to specify the question ,",
    "let us note that in general the yang - mills equations on a manifold @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 where the curvature matrix ( field strentgh ) @xmath21 with exterior differential @xmath22 and the cartan s ( exterior ) product @xmath23 , while @xmath24 means the hodge star operator conforming to a metric on manifold under consideration , @xmath25 is a gauge coupling constant .",
    "the most important case of @xmath19 is minkowski spacetime and we are interested in the confining solutions @xmath26 of the su(3)-yang - mills equations .",
    "the confining solutions were defined in ref .",
    "@xcite as the spherically symmetric solutions of the yang - mills equations ( 1 ) containing only the components of the su(@xmath27)-field which are coulomb - like or linear in @xmath2 .",
    "additionally we impose the lorentz condition on the sought solutions .",
    "the latter condition is necessary for quantizing the gauge fields consistently within the framework of perturbation theory ( see , e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so we should impose the given condition that can be written in the form @xmath28 , where the divergence of the lie algebra valued 1-form @xmath29 is defined by the relation ( see , e. g. , refs . )",
    "@xmath30 it should be emphasized that , from the physical point of view , the lorentz condition reflects the fact of transversality for gluons that arise as quanta of su(3)-yang - mills field when quantizing the latter ( see , e. g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    under the circumstances , the unique nonperturbative confining solution of the su(3)-yang - mills equations looks as follows",
    "@xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 with the real constants @xmath35 parametrizing the family . as has been repeatedly discussed by us earlier ( see , e. g. , refs .",
    "and below ) , from the above form it is clear that the solution ( 3 ) is a configuration describing the electric coulomb - like colour field ( components @xmath36 ) and the magnetic colour field linear in @xmath2 ( components @xmath37 ) and we wrote down the solution ( 3 ) in the combinations that are just needed further to insert into the corresponding dirac equation ( for more details see refs . ) .    the word _ unique _ should be understood in the strict mathematical sense .",
    "in fact in ref .",
    "@xcite the following theorem was proved ( see also appendix b ) :    _ the unique exact spherically symmetric ( nonperturbative ) confining solutions ( depending only on @xmath2 and @xmath38 ) of su(3)-yang - mills equations in minkowski spacetime consist of the family of ( 3)_.    it should be noted that solution ( 3 ) was found early in ref . @xcite but its uniqueness was proved just in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . besides , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the above unique confining solutions ( 3 ) satisfy the so - called wilson confinement criterion .",
    "up to now nobody contested this result so if we want to describe interaction between quarks by spherically symmetric confining su(3)-fields then they can be only those from the above theorem .",
    "now one should say that the similar unique confining solutions exist for all semisimple and non - semisimple compact lie groups , in particular , for su(@xmath39 ) with @xmath4 and u(@xmath39 ) with @xmath5 .",
    "explicit form of solutions , e.g. , for su(@xmath39 ) with @xmath40 can be found in ref.@xcite but it should be emphasized that components linear in @xmath2 always represent the magnetic ( colour ) field in all the mentioned solutions . within the present paper",
    "we are especially interested in the u(1)-case ( electrodynamics ) and a proof of the above uniqueness theorem for that situation is adduced in appendix b for inquiring .",
    "under this situation the yang - mills equations ( 1 ) turn into the second pair of maxwell equations @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 . as is discussed in appendix b , in the spherically symmetric case the equations ( 4 ) are equivalent to @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and we write down the unique solutions of ( 5 ) as @xmath47 with some constants @xmath48 parametrizing solutions .    to interpret solutions ( 6 ) in the more habitual physical terms",
    "let us pass on to cartesian coordinates employing the relations @xmath49 which entails @xmath50 and we conclude that the solutions ( 6 ) describe the combination of the electric coulomb field with potential @xmath51 and the constant magnetic field with the vector - potential ( 8) which can be written as ( using isomorphism @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , see appendix a ) @xmath55 which is _ linear _ in @xmath2 in spherical coordinates .",
    "let us compute 3-dimensional divergence @xmath56 with the help of 3-dimensional hodge star operator ( see appendix a ) . in spherical coordinates",
    "we have [ see ( a.12 ) and ( a.7 ) ] @xmath57= \\ast d\\left(\\frac{br+b}{\\sin{\\vartheta}}dr\\wedge d\\vartheta\\right)=0\\>.\\ ] ]    then eqs . ( 4 ) in cartesian coordinates take the form @xmath58 with the laplace operator @xmath59 .",
    "also it is easy to check that the solution under consideration satisfies the 4-dimensional lorentz condition @xmath28 , where 4-dimensional divergence is defined by ( 2 ) .    finally ,",
    "as is shown in appendix a , the corresponding strength of magnetic field is @xmath60 @xmath61 respectively , in spherical and cartesian coordinates .",
    "as is seen from ( 8) and ( 11 ) , the magnetic field under exploration has the singularities on the @xmath62-axis so its formal mathematical definition domain is the manifold @xmath63 with the @xmath62-axis discarded rather than the manifold @xmath64 .",
    "singularities of such a kind are of mathematical nature and appear when trying to write a _ concrete macroscopic physical field _ in an analytical form .",
    "physical origin of the given singularities is that some sources generating the field should be present on @xmath62-axis .",
    "another matter is that the field under consideration may probably be modelled by miscellaneous ways . for the sake of completeness , one of possible physical realization",
    "will be considered in sec .",
    "6 . in theoretical considerations within classical approach",
    "one should segregate from a concrete realization of one or another macroscopic electromagnetic field and consider them to be given on their natural mathematical definition domains .    at the quantum level , however , treatment of singularities may be different from classical one . in particular , in the case of gluonic field ( 3 ) the problem of singularity along @xmath62-axis of magnetic part for solution ( 3 ) can be resolved by that quarks may emit gluons outside of some cone @xmath65 so singularity along @xmath62-axis plays no role ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite and estimates for @xmath66 in pions and kaons therein ) .      as was mentioned in section 1 , at quantum level the confinement of quarks",
    "is basically governed by the magnetic ( colour ) part ( linear in @xmath2 ) of solution ( 3 ) , as has been discussed in refs . .",
    "in the present paper we would like , at classical level , to explore the behaviour of a charged particle moving in the confining magnetic field ( 11 ) .",
    "accordingly , we need to study classical equations of motion for such a particle . as is known ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , those equations are obtained from lagrangian @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are , respectively , charge and mass of a particle while the form of both the velocity square @xmath70 and the scalar product @xmath71 depends on choice of curvilinear coordinates . then the sought equations are derived from ( 12 ) according to the standard prescription of lagrange approach as @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the chosen coordinates and the dot signifies differentiation with respect to @xmath74 . for our purposes",
    "the equations of motion will be useful in both spherical and cartesian coordinates .",
    "one can note that @xmath75 is conserved @xcite when moving in a constant magnetic field , i.e. , the full energy @xmath76 of ( relativistic ) particle is also conserved . in the case of spherical coordinates we have @xmath77 , @xmath78 ,",
    "@xmath79 with @xmath80 from ( 8) and in accordance with ( 13 ) we obtain @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 with dimensionless parameter @xmath84 . in the case of cartesian",
    "coordinates we have @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 with @xmath80 from ( 8)(9 ) and ( 13 ) gives rise to @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 also we should add the initial conditions to ( 14)(16 ) and ( 17)(19 ) .",
    "namely , putting an initial moment of time @xmath91 for simplicity , we have , respectively , @xmath92 or @xmath93",
    "let us above all find out how the magnetic field lines look for the field of ( 11 ) .",
    "according to a general prescription ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) we should determine integral curves for differential system @xmath94 which can be made if finding the first integrals for it , i.e. , such functions @xmath95 that satisfy the partial differential equation @xmath96 then , as is not complicated to check , the system ( 22 ) has two independent first integrals , namely @xmath97 , @xmath98 with constants @xmath99 .",
    "that is , integral surfaces are planes and spheres and , as a result , integral curves are circles .",
    "for example , the plane @xmath100 is integral surface and equations of field lines are @xmath101 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .      we can note that @xmath102\\eqno(24)\\ ] ] with @xmath103 . multiplying ( 17 ) ,",
    "( 18 ) , ( 19 ) by @xmath104 , respectively , and adding the results , we get @xmath105 to calculate @xmath106 we notice that @xmath107 and replacing @xmath108 according to ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) , conformably , we shall have @xmath109 wherefrom @xmath110 where a constant @xmath111 can be found from initial conditions ( 21 ) when considering ( 26 ) at @xmath112 so @xmath113 and @xmath114 we can consider @xmath115 which always holds true for the strong enough field when @xmath116 and , consequently , @xmath117 . then , considering ( 27 ) on @xmath62-axis where @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath119 which signifies that particle trajectory can reach @xmath62-axis only at @xmath120 .",
    "it should be recalled that according to sec .",
    "2 the @xmath62-axis is forbidden for motion of a particle so if for the particle @xmath119 at some moment then after it one should consider the motion to be finished and the particle vanished .",
    "now , using ( 26 ) , we can rewrite ( 25 ) as @xmath121 with spherical coordinate @xmath122 . at last , with the help of ( 28 ) we derive from ( 24 ) @xmath123\\>.     \\eqno(29)\\ ] ] at @xmath124 from here it follows @xmath125dt > \\frac{1}{a_0}\\int v^2dt>0\\ > , \\eqno(30)\\ ] ] which signifies that @xmath2 is increasing .",
    "but if @xmath126 , i.e. , @xmath127 , then @xmath128 and from ( 30 ) we gain @xmath129dt<\\frac{1}{2a_0 } \\int \\left(v^2-\\frac{1}{2\\mu^2}\\right)dt<0\\ > , \\eqno(31)\\ ] ] provided that @xmath130 i.e. , @xmath2 is decreasing",
    ". it should be emphasized that for sufficiently strong field ( @xmath116 ) the condition ( 32 ) will always be fulfilled for the given @xmath131 . besides , under this situation , @xmath132 and we can see that spherical coordinate @xmath2 never tends to infinity and oscillates near the initial value @xmath133 .",
    "inasmuch as , as said above , @xmath134 , @xmath135 is a magnetic field line , then we can say that the particle trajectory oscillates near the magnetic field line defined by initial conditions .",
    "in other words , we get the full confinement of charged particle in the magnetic field under discussion which is sketched out in fig .",
    "to illustrate the general properties decribed in section 3 it should be noted that the system ( 14)(16 ) seems to be insoluble in an explicit form . but let us try to obtain an asymptotical solution of it in the form of expansions in the dimensionless parameter @xmath84 in the strong field limit when @xmath136 , i.e. , @xmath117 . for this aim",
    "we can notice that the angle @xmath137 for lagrangian @xmath138 of ( 12 ) is the so - called cyclic coordinate , i.e. @xmath138 does not depend on @xmath137 .",
    "then in accordance with the lagrange approach we have an integral of motion [ see ( 13 ) ] in the form @xmath139 with using the initial data of ( 20 ) .",
    "from here it follows @xmath140 and it is not complicated to rewrite the system ( 14)(16 ) in the form @xmath141",
    "@xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 with @xmath145 .",
    "further we seek for @xmath2 , @xmath122 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 in the form @xmath148 @xmath149 where @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 are some functions of @xmath74 .",
    "now , expanding the right - hand side of ( 35 ) in @xmath159 , we obtain @xmath160 so we should have @xmath161 .",
    "then the following terms of expansion for the right - hand side ( 35 ) give rise to relation @xmath162 which yields @xmath163 .",
    "in this situation the new terms of expansion for the right - hand side ( 35 ) lead to @xmath164 and it should be @xmath165 let us now pass on to the equation ( 36 ) where the conforming expansion with the help of ( 39 ) yields @xmath166 from here we have @xmath167 and , consequently , @xmath168 . accordingly the equation ( 37 ) gives rise to @xmath169 which entails @xmath170 , @xmath171 since we have above obtained that @xmath161 , @xmath163 . in the circumstances",
    "the relation ( 40 ) gives @xmath172    at last , in a similar way from ( 38 ) we can obtain the relation @xmath173 which entails @xmath174 and , as a result , @xmath175 with some constant @xmath176 .",
    "then , taking into account ( 39 ) and ( 41 ) , we finally have @xmath177      when searching for @xmath137 in the form @xmath178 we shall , according to ( 34 ) , obtain @xmath179 wherefrom , with the help of ( 41 ) , we get @xmath180 , @xmath181 and , consequently , @xmath182 , @xmath183 with some constants @xmath184 .",
    "so finally @xmath185      at @xmath117 with taking ( 20 ) , ( 42 ) and ( 43 ) into account we find @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 .",
    "this eventually leads to the final expressions @xmath189 @xmath190 that confirm the general considerations of section 3 ( see also fig .",
    "as is clear from ( 44 ) , if we want a charged particle to be near magnetic field line @xmath134 , @xmath135 defined by intitial conditions then we should impose the condition @xmath191 which entails @xmath192 if defining the physical components of velocity in spherical coordinates by equality @xmath193 then we get @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 and the condition ( 45 ) signifies that @xmath197 .",
    "but , obviously , @xmath198 so the condition @xmath199 can be rewritten as @xmath200 with @xmath201 and the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath202 in the chosen system of units .      for this case",
    "typical values @xmath203 m ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and at temperature of plasma @xmath204 mev ( @xmath205 k ) we have a mean thermal deuteron velocity @xmath206 with the deuteron rest energy @xmath207 mev @xmath208 mev , @xmath209 and ( 46 ) yields @xmath210 mev .",
    "let us take @xmath211 gev and , for the sake of simplicity , put @xmath212 .",
    "then in accordance with ( a.17 ) the module of magnetic field strength near the particle trajectory will be @xmath213 i.e. , it is a quite accessible value under the laboratory conditions .",
    "it should be , however , noted that for the time @xmath74 of order 1 s necessary to confine plasma before thermonuclear reaction starts @xcite the angle @xmath122 can get increase @xmath214 according to ( 44 ) , i.e. promptness of particle along the magnetic field line @xmath134 , @xmath135 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) will approximately be equal to @xmath215 , i.e. , the particle will repeatedly cross @xmath62-axis which is impossible since the @xmath62-axis is forbidden for motion , as was mentioned in sec . 2 and 3 .",
    "but if @xmath216 then @xmath217 as well .",
    "we can draw the conclusion that deuteron rushing in to the field with @xmath218 will remain near its initial position during the time @xmath219",
    "s.      we may with minor reservations try applying the results obtained also to quarks within hadrons , e.g. , within charged pions @xmath220 . in this case",
    "quarks are moving in the classical confining su(3)-gluonic field ( 3 ) but they are quntum objects described by the wave functions - the modulo square integrable solutions of the dirac equation in the field ( 3 ) ( for more details see refs . ) .",
    "let us , however , look at what the classical estimate ( 46 ) can give for quarks where , obviously , electric charge should be replaced by colour one and @xmath221 by @xmath222 , the strong coupling constant .",
    "we can use the fact that the colour magnetic field between quarks can be characterized by an effective colour strength @xmath223 with @xmath224 and @xmath225 from the solution ( 3 ) while @xmath2 stands for the distance between quarks . then ( 46 ) allow us to introduce quantity @xmath226 and for @xmath227-quark in @xmath228-mesons with @xmath229 mev , @xmath230 , @xmath231 @xcite we obtain @xmath232 mev which at the scale of pion @xmath233 fm entails @xmath234 mev@xmath235 t when @xmath236 . in reality , from quantum considerations @xcite for @xmath228-mesons it follows @xmath237 gev , @xmath238 gev so @xmath239 gev @xmath240 and at the scales of the meson under consideration we have @xcite @xmath241 t. as a result , classical estimate corresponds to the quantum considerations .",
    "it is useful to compare our results with the well - known case of motion of a charged particle in the homogeneous magnetic field ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which is sketched out in fig .",
    "3 .    in the latter case",
    "the particle moves along helical curve with lead of helix @xmath242 and radius @xmath243 . as a consequence",
    ", the homogeneous magnetic field does not give rise to the full confinement of the particle since the latter may go to infinity along the helical curve .",
    "another matter is the case of the magnetic field ( 11 ) .",
    "as we have seen above it provides the full confinement of any charged particle in case the field is strong enough : under any initial conditions the particle motion is accomplished within a finite region of space so that the particle trajectory is near magnetic field lines while the latter are compact manifolds ( circles ) .",
    "this was explicitly demonstrated in section 4 by obtaining asymptotical form of the motion under discussion .    taking into account such remarkable properties of the magnetic field in question",
    "we may hope that it should find a number of applications , in particular , in thermonuclear plasma physics where the problem of confinement of plasma during a sufficiently long time has so far not solved in a satisfactory way @xcite .",
    "but for it one should explore the possible ways of modeling the field ( 11 ) in laboratory conditions which is seemingly not such a simple task . one of possible physical realization is sketched out in fig . 4 and is accomplished between two cone ferromagnetic pole pieces where the fact is used that magnetic field lines of ferromagnet are perpendicular to its surface .",
    "of course , field lines inside the pole pieces ( shown by dash lines ) break off but if diameter @xmath244 while the pole pieces are approaching , the whole construction tends to the the formal mathematical definition domain @xmath63 . in this realization",
    "it is clear why particles will leave the field : they will just be absorbed by pole pieces when moving along the field line .",
    "so one needs to fit parameters ( in particular , the values of module @xmath245 ) of the whole construction in such a way that a particle could remain on trajectory for a long enough time @xmath74 ( e.g. , for deuteron in thermonuclear plasma @xmath246 s according to sec .",
    "5 ) not reaching the pole pieces .",
    "finally , as has been said in section 1 , the main motivation of writing the given paper was to interpret the mechanism of quark confinement proposed in refs . in classical terms . as seems to us , we could to a certain degree do it .",

    "@xcite ) , i. e. , on the arbitrary linear combinations of forms @xmath302 , where coefficients @xmath303 belong to some space of matrices @xmath304 , for example , a su(@xmath27)-lie algebra . but now the cartan s wedge ( exterior ) product @xmath23 should be understood as product of matrices with elements consisting of usual ( scalar ) differential forms . in the su(3)-case , if @xmath305 are matrices of generators of the su(@xmath27)-lie algebra in @xmath27-dimensional representation , we continue the above scalar product @xmath253 on the su(@xmath27)-lie algebra valued 1-forms @xmath306 and @xmath307 by the relation @xmath308 where tr signifies the trace of a matrix , and , on linearity with the help of ( a.1 ) , @xmath253 can be continued over any su(@xmath27)-lie algebra valued forms .",
    "such a matrix - valued generalization of @xmath24-operator is extremely useful when exploring solutions of the yang - mills ( and maxwell ) equations in minkowski spacetime and was systematically employed in refs . .",
    "the basic property of the exterior differential @xmath22 is the same form in the arbitrary curvilinear coordinates @xmath309 on @xmath7 .",
    "namely , @xmath310 with @xmath311 . for example",
    ", in cartesian and spherical coordinates we have , respectively , @xmath312 or @xmath313 .    passing on now to the vector analysis on @xmath7",
    ", we should note that it is usually formulated in cartesian coordinates , where all main operations ( divergence , curl operator and so on ) look in the simplest form which makes difficulties when transfering to the arbitrary curvilinear coordinates .",
    "we can , however , simplify the situation if noting that there is one - to - one correspondence between any vector field @xmath314 with @xmath315 and 1-form @xmath316 so that the latter will be denoted by the same notation @xmath317 in what follows . when describing vector fields by 1-forms , however , we at once gain a number of advantages . indeed , according to the standard rules @xcite it is easy to get an expression of @xmath317 in the arbitrary curvilinear coordinates @xmath318 , @xmath319 , if knowing @xmath104 as the functions @xmath318 .",
    "this is done by replacing @xmath320 , @xmath321 , @xmath322 , @xmath323 in the expression of @xmath317 in cartesian coordinates and we at one blow obtain the components of @xmath317 in the given curvilinear coordinates ",
    "those are just the coefficients at the corresponding @xmath324 .",
    "further , the basic products of vectors , scalar and vectorial ones , are now simply written through the conforming differential forms .",
    "namely , scalar product @xmath325 , vectorial product @xmath326 , where metric coefficients @xmath327 and the hodge star operator @xmath24 are defined by the expression @xmath328 in the given curvilinear coordinates [ see , e.g. , ( a.6)(a.8 ) ] .    at last , we have the standard de rham complex @xmath329 which enables us to write down the main operations of vector analysis as @xmath330 with arbitrary function @xmath331 , so that , in virtue of the famous property @xmath332 for operator @xmath22 , we automatically obtain the identities @xmath333 , @xmath334 , provided that the first and second de rham cohomology groups of @xmath7 are equal to zero : @xmath335 .",
    "it should be emphasized that relations ( a.12 ) hold true for any curvilinear coordinates as soon as the expression of metric @xmath328 is fixed in those coordinates and , accordingly , the hodge star operator action is defined on any @xmath147-form .",
    "after computing with using the given curvilinear coordinates we can always return to cartesian ones by replacing @xmath336 , @xmath337 , @xmath338 , @xmath339 .",
    "many relations of vector analysis obtained in cartesian coordinates can easily be generalized to the arbitrary curvilinear coordinates within the formulation under consideration .",
    "for example , the identities @xmath340 @xmath341 acquire the form @xmath342 @xmath343 holding true for any curvilinear coordinates . on the other hand , if trying to use ( a.13)(a.14 ) within framework of the standard formulation , e.g. , in spherical coordinates , then this will lead to the perfectly bulky expressions . at the same time , the right - hand sides of ( a.15)(a.16 ) are easily computed for concrete @xmath317 and @xmath344 in any curvilinear coordinates along the lines above .      to illustrate some of the above",
    "let us compute the strength @xmath345 of the confining magnetic field of ( 8)(9 ) in cartesian coordinates .",
    "by definition we have @xmath346 and in spherical coordinates @xmath347 . then in accordance with ( a.12 ) and ( a.7 ) @xmath348=\\ast(bdr\\wedge d\\varphi)= -\\frac{b}{\\sin{\\vartheta}}d\\vartheta = h_\\vartheta d\\vartheta$ ] which entails the module @xmath349 .    on the other hand , @xmath350 wherefrom @xmath351 at last , @xmath352 and we get @xmath353 or , using the above isomorphism @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath354 so the module @xmath355",
    "the facts adduced here have been obained in refs . and",
    "we concisely give them only for completeness of discussion in section 2 .",
    "for the case of u(1)-group the yang - mills equations ( 1 ) turn into the second pair of maxwell equations @xmath356 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the most general ansatz for a spherically symmetric solution is @xmath357 .    for the latter ansatz we have @xmath358 for an arbitrary @xmath359",
    "then , according to ( a.9 ) , we obtain @xmath360 which entails @xmath361 @xmath362 wherefrom one can conclude that @xmath363 @xmath364 and we draw the conclusion that @xmath365 with some constant @xmath366 .",
    "but then the lorentz condition ( 2 ) for the given ansatz gives rise to @xmath367 or @xmath368 which yields @xmath369 with a constant @xmath370 .",
    "but the confining solutions should be spherically symmetric and contain only the components which are coulomb - like or linear in @xmath2 , so one should put @xmath371 .",
    "consequently , the ansatz @xmath372 is the most general spherically symmetric one and then equations ( b.4 ) give    @xmath373 with some constants @xmath48 parametrizing solutions which proves the uniqueness theorem of section 2 for u(1)-group .",
    "minor modification of the above considerations allows us to spread the proof to the yang - mills equations ( 1 ) ( for more details see refs . ) ."
