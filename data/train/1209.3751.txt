    "in this paper we investigate the following general question for every integer @xmath9    question 1 . given a sequence @xmath10 of pairwise disjoint monotone and @xmath11",

    "+ to see the relevance of this question , consider a sequence @xmath16 of objects ( functions , points in a topological space , vectors of a normed space , etc ) and let @xmath17 be the collection of all infinite subsets @xmath15 of @xmath2 for which the corresponding subsequence of @xmath18 has some property @xmath19 that is inherited when passing to a subsequence . if @xmath16 is a sequence of vectors of some normed space setting , the properties @xmath19 could be for example different incompatible estimates on how the norms are computed in the subsequence ( e.g. , being @xmath20-sequence , @xmath21-sequence , @xmath22-sequence , etc . ) . in the topological",
    "setting , we could consider @xmath23 to be the property of being convergent to a point @xmath24 , and @xmath25 not accumulating to @xmath24 , and many other variants .",
    "we want to know whether by passing to a subsequence of @xmath16 we could get some canonical behavior in each such example .",
    "note that the example in the normed space setting is more concrete , _",
    "analytic _ as we will call it , and that the general topological example looks rather unmanageable .",
    "as we will see , this turns out to be the dividing line between cases where the structure can be found and the cases where the structure is absent .",
    "before we proceed further we need a concept that helps us in properly stating the somewhat vague question 1 above .",
    "namely , we say that classes @xmath26 are _ separated _ if we can find a partition @xmath3 such that @xmath4 for all @xmath5 if they are not separated , they are said to be _ mixed _ or that they form a _",
    "( if @xmath27 we have a 2-gap , which is what is usually called just a _ gap _ ) .",
    "what we are after is a combinatorial structure theory that would recognize _ all _ the canonical @xmath0-gaps",
    "@xmath10 modulo the possibility of replacing it by an appropriate restrictions @xmath14 to infinite subsets @xmath15 of @xmath8 that this project , even in the case @xmath27 is of a great complexity was first realized by hausdorff @xcite more than a century ago after a series of earlier papers of du bois - reymond  @xcite and hadamard  @xcite showing that the case of countable families @xmath17 presents no difficulties .",
    "what hausdorff showed is that there exist @xmath28-gaps that could code objects far outside the reach of structure theory we would hope to develop .",
    "it is interesting that even such a non - structure theorem of hausdorff would bare some fruits such as , for example , the solution of kaplanski s problem ( see  @xcite ) about the automatic continuity in the context of banach algebras where the answers essentially depended on whether the list of spectra of @xmath28-gaps discovered by hausdorff  @xcite is complete or not ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . + when considering problems arising in the mathematical practise , the gaps that one gets are not just arbitrary , but usually have a low descriptive complexity and , in fact , are of low borel complexity like for example , the ones we have mentioned above in the context of normed spaces . it was the second author  @xcite who first realized that many of the pathologies that might occur in arbitrary gaps can be ruled out for gaps of certain descriptive complexity , and so , in particular , the pathologies discovered by hausdorff in  @xcite and  @xcite discussed above .",
    "it is interesting that even the special structure theory of descriptive @xmath28-gaps developed in  @xcite has found some substantial applications ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . +",
    "the need to consider more than two families @xmath17 was first encountered in one of our previous papers  @xcite while trying to give lower estimate on norms of averaging operators .",
    "it turns out that a number of new phenomena show up when considering more than two families .",
    "the following problem posed in  @xcite in a different language , has turned out to be a key leading question in our research since then .",
    "question 2 : suppose that @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 is a 3-gap .",
    "can we find a restriction to an infinite set @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 in which one of the three families is empty and the remaining two form a 2-gap ?",
    "this looks like a rather arbitrary question , but in fact it is a question that reveals the key difficulty in any program of building a useful structure theory of descriptive @xmath0-gaps . in analogy to hausdorff s nonstructure theorem discussed above , there is a negative answer found in  @xcite by considering three classes of sets built out of a certain partition of the real line into non - measurable sets .",
    "but what if the classes of subsequences are of reasonable descriptive complexity as these are the classes that one usually finds in the practise ?",
    "this was left open in  @xcite , and in fact , in this paper we develop a whole new technology to answer question 2 in the positive .",
    "+ the new theory of descriptive @xmath0-gaps that we develop here uses three layers of arguments belonging to different areas of mathematics .",
    "the first layer requires a suitable extension of the analytic gap theorems from  @xcite that gives them a particularly canonical _ tree - representation_. this is done in section  [ sectionfirstdich ] .",
    "the word analytic here refers to the descriptive complexity of continuous images of polish spaces , a complexity that covers essentially all cases in practice .",
    "however , we show in section  [ sectiondeterminacy ] that assuming projective determinacy , all results hold for projective families as well . in practical terms , it means that even coanalytic or any reasonably definable classes @xmath17 of sequences can be studied within this theory .",
    "+ once the tree - representation is settled , the second layer is a new ramsey principle for trees , not covered by the ramsey theory of strong subtrees of milliken  @xcite ( used in our previous paper @xcite ) , that we could only develop using some deep reasoning from topological dynamics .",
    "we have devoted section  [ sectionramsey ] to this result , that we feel that it is of independent interest and may have further applications .",
    "after this ramsey theorem is applied , we are given , for every @xmath0 , a _ finite list _ of basic analytic @xmath0-gaps so that , given any analytic @xmath0-gap , the restriction to a suitable infinite subset of @xmath2 must be isomorphic ( in a precise sense , see definitions  [ orderdefinition ] and  [ equivalencedefinition ] ) to one of the gaps from the finite list .",
    "this means that those configurations that appear in that list are possible , but whatever is not found there is a forbidden behavior in the analytic case .",
    "so we have just reached the level in the development of our theory where we show that for each positive integer @xmath0 canonical examples of pairwise disjoint @xmath0-sequences @xmath10 of monotone families of infinite subsets of @xmath2 do exist and that , in fact , there are only finitely many of them that could be described in some detail . for example , in section  [ sectionhigh ] we give an expression for and some lower and upper estimates on the cardinality @xmath35 of the irredundant list of basic @xmath0-gaps .",
    "for example , we have    @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a function given by certain sum of combinatorial numbers , whose asymptotic behavior is @xmath38 the number @xmath37 is in fact of independent interest as it is equal to the cardinality of the set of all _ oscillation types _ that are directly used in defining the basic @xmath0-gaps on the index - set @xmath39 rather than on @xmath8 they are suggested by our ramsey - theoretic analysis of analytic @xmath0-gaps that give us embeddings from @xmath39 into @xmath2 transfering the basic @xmath0-gaps into restrictions of arbitrary analytic @xmath0-gaps . +",
    "it is now clear how to answer question 2 above : check that all 3-gaps from the finite list satisfy that property , just one by one .",
    "the problem is that the information that we are given after this first two layers of arguments is still rough .",
    "to get an idea of the difficulties in the structure theory developed up to this point , it would provide a list of @xmath40 basic 3-gaps .",
    "the checking task perhaps could be given in such raw terms to a computer for this particular question , but we are interested in a general understanding of what is possible and what is not in the context of analytic gaps . for this purpose , the information needs to be refined , and this can only be done using finite combinatorial methods in order to study how certain functions act on certain special types of finite subsets of finitely branching trees .",
    "this is the third layer of the theory , to which chapter  [ chapterworking ] is devoted .",
    "with the three layers developed , we are able to find in chapter  [ chapterlists ] the complete descriptions of the _ irredundant _ lists of the minimal analytic 2-gaps and of the minimal analytic 3-gaps and get a considerable grip on the minimal lists for @xmath41 . + we must mention that , although we have been guided by multidimensional problems , our theory already gives new and deeper information about classical 2-gaps .",
    "so far , only the first layer of the theory for 2-gaps had been considered in  @xcite .",
    "the lists of 5 minimal 2-gaps and of 163 minimal 3-gaps provides a book where to check any three - dimensional question on definable gaps of the sort of question 2 .",
    "but the effort to get these somehow exotic lists should not be viewed only as an objective in itself , but such a task has guided us in developing the combinatorial tools from chapter  [ chapterworking ] that unravel the structure of general analytic @xmath0-gaps .",
    "these tools however , are not enough for a _ full _ understanding of analytic @xmath0-gaps for @xmath42 in other words , we do not have a _ precise _ description of the minimal analytic @xmath0-gaps for large @xmath0 , so we do not have a general method to solve _ any _ given question in higher dimensions .",
    "the reason is that the finite combinatorics involved -what we called the third layer - is too intricate .",
    "we do not know if it would be possible to go deeper in the understanding of these combinatorial questions and get a general description of the minimal analytic @xmath0-gaps , or if this might be as hopeless as trying to have a full understanding of , say , how all finite groups look like .",
    "we should , however , mention that we do have a substantial partial description of the family of all basic analytic @xmath0-gaps that is still quite useful . for example , using this theory , we are able to answer questions like question 2 above for an arbitrary integer @xmath0 in place of @xmath43 + the reader can get a flavor of the kind of special constrains that our results establish on how definable classes @xmath17 can be mixed , by looking at the following sample result : let @xmath44 be an analytic @xmath0-gap .",
    "then there exists a an infinite set @xmath15 where @xmath45 and @xmath33 form a 2-gap , while all but at most 6 of the remaining classes @xmath46 are empty .",
    "the number 6 is optimal , and corresponds to the value @xmath47 of the function @xmath48 mentioned above .",
    "the proof of this fact , the answer to question 2 and other results of the kind are given in chapter  [ chapterapplications ] .",
    "+ we should also mention our previous paper  @xcite as an important precedent of this work .",
    "we consider there similar problems but dealing with _",
    "countable separation _ instead of _ separation , _ and _ strong @xmath0-gaps _ instead of general @xmath0-gaps . a similar structure in three layers is present there , but the three of them were much easier . on the first layer ,",
    "the generalization of the corresponding dichotomy of  @xcite was easier to figure out , and this was already done in  @xcite . on the second layer , the ramsey principle needed was much weaker and followed from milliken s theorem  @xcite . on the third layer ,",
    "the finite combinatorics involved was less intricate , and we were able to completely analyze them and to give a satisfactory description of the minimal analytic strong @xmath0-gaps for every positive integer @xmath0 . + as it will be clear , we hope , to anyone reading this paper , the results that follow from the theory that we develop in this paper are easy to state and understand and deal with very basic objects that are of wide interest : sequences and different kind of subsequences .",
    "they are however rather difficult facts to prove and very much unexpected .",
    "as we mentioned at the beginning of this introduction , the analytic gap dichotomies proved by the second author in  @xcite , which correspond to the first layer of our theory ( in dimension 2 ) , have been already found quite useful .",
    "it is natural to expect more applications with the deeper and more general theory at hand , and in more areas in mathematics than we presently have .",

    "the notion of @xmath82-gap is more general than that of a @xmath67-gap , since it does not require the preideals to be pairwise orthogonal . on the other hand ,",
