    "the universality of phase transitions is one of the most important concepts in the theoretical description of critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "it implies that continuous phase transitions fall into universality classes determined by only a few gross properties characterizing the respective system , namely , the number of components of the order parameter and their symmetry , the dimensionality of space , and the range of interaction .",
    "renormalization - group ( rg ) theory then predicts that , e.g. , critical exponents are identical for all systems within a given such class .",
    "for instance , the lambda transition undergone by liquid @xmath3he at the temperature of @xmath4  kelvin is the primary example of the three - dimensional @xmath2 universality class , that is , the class with a two - dimensional ( or complex ) order parameter with @xmath5 symmetry in three spatial dimensions , and with short - range interactions .",
    "thus , the critical exponent describing the specific - heat singularity at the lambda point , which was found to be @xmath6 in an elaborate zero - gravity experiment  @xcite , should coincide with the corresponding exponent predicted by @xmath7  theory .",
    "indeed , a seven - loop expansion in three dimensions has resulted in the value @xmath8",
    "@xcite , while @xmath9 has been obtained by combining monte carlo simulations based on finite - size scaling methods with high - temperature expansions  @xcite .",
    "evidently these two theoretical estimates bracket the experimental value , but do not agree with it , nor with themselves , within the margins of uncertainty stated .",
    "thus , this core test of rg theory is not fully conclusive yet ; if one accepts the experimental result there still is a need to improve the theoretical calculations .    in this situation",
    "it may be of interest to observe that the notion of universality also includes quantum phase transitions , that is , transitions which occur at zero temperature upon variation of a parameter of the system under consideration , being triggered by quantum rather than thermal fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the mott insulator - to - superfluid transition exhibited by the bose - hubbard model on a @xmath10-dimensional cubic lattice falls into the universality class of the @xmath11-dimensional @xmath2 model at special multicritical points with particle - hole symmetry  @xcite , implying that the critical exponents provided by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose - hubbard model should agree with those of the lambda transition .",
    "now that this 2d bose - hubbard model has been emulated with ultracold @xmath12rb atoms loaded into stacks of planar optical lattices  @xcite , and even the condensate fraction of such a bose gas in a 2d lattice has been measured across the mott insulator - to - superfluid transition  @xcite , future precision experiments on this system might enable one to accurately determine the corresponding critical exponents , and thus to provide a further nontrivial test of universality .",
    "indeed , the exploration of critical behavior with ultracold dilute quantum gases has already been taken up by donner _",
    "et al . _ , who have measured the critical exponent of the correlation length for a harmonically trapped , weakly interacting 3d bose gas , albeit with a still comparatively large error bar  @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the archetypal bose - hubbard model lends itself to alternative computational schemes .",
    "only recently , ranon and dupuis have presented a detailed rg approach to this model , taking into account both local and long - distance fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "somewhat alarmingly , the numerical value of the critical exponent for the correlation length of the 2d system derived from that study amounts to @xmath13 , differing quite substantially from the value @xmath14 previously reported by campostrini _",
    "et al . _",
    "this finding appears to put universality into question , and hence calls for further independent calculations . in the present paper",
    "we establish a `` hands - on '' approach to the critical exponents of the bose - hubbard model , based on the field - theoretic concept of the effective potential  @xcite , which opens a natural bridge to landau s theory of phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the exponent @xmath15 for the condensate density , and on the exponent @xmath16 for the superfluid density , from which one can deduce all other critical exponents by exploiting ( hyper-)scaling relations  @xcite .",
    "we proceed as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we retrace the basic steps required for deriving the landau expansion of the effective potential  @xcite , and explain how this expansion is employed for computing both the condensate and the superfluid density . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we recapitulate the idea of the process chain approach  @xcite , which yields perturbative approximants to the individal landau coefficients .",
    "the results obtained by evaluating the perturbation series numerically to high orders in the hopping strength are then discussed at length in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] . here",
    "we encounter a vexing problem , namely , the divergency of weak - coupling perturbation theory . in principle , this calls for a systematic resummation procedure for deducing the `` true '' , regular landau coefficients from their diverging polynomial approximants . nonetheless ,",
    "here we show that even _ without _ such a procedure , but by explicitly including the seldom considered landau coefficient @xmath0 into the analysis , one is able to extract critical exponents for the 2d  bose - hubbard system which agree to better than @xmath1 with those computed for the lambda transition  @xcite , thus providing fair evidence in favor of universality .",
    "our _ ad hoc _ procedure still requires formal justification and hence should be regarded as preliminary , but quite similar results are obtained by applying variational perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in the final sec .",

    "as is well known , the particle - delocalizing tendency of @xmath29 counteracts the localizing tendency of the repulsive interaction , so that the system exhibits a transition from a mott insulator to a superfluid when the control parameter @xmath30 is enhanced gradually , while the scaled chemical potential @xmath31 is kept constant  @xcite .    in order to map out this quantum phase transition ,",

    "the free energy @xmath36 of the extended system is given by the ground - state expectation value of its hamiltonian , @xmath37 assuming the lattice to consist of @xmath38 sites ( while stipulating that the thermodynamic limit @xmath39 be taken eventually ) , we expand this free energy in the form @xmath40 so that @xmath41 denotes the free energy per site of the original system  ( [ eq : hbh ] ) . the fact that @xmath36 is expressed here in powers of @xmath42 , rather than of @xmath35 and @xmath43 individually , is understood from the perturbative viewpoint adopted in the following section : if one regards the creation and annihilation operations implementing these sources and drains as individual perturbation events , it is obvious that only processes with an equal number of creation and annihilation events , and hence terms with equal powers of @xmath35 and @xmath43 , can contribute to the expectation value  ( [ eq : gev ] ) .    following the guiding insight that the response of the system to the sources or drains , and hence the change of @xmath36 with @xmath35 or @xmath43 , should reveal its state , it is only natural to consider the intensive quantities @xmath44 the respective first equalities in these two relations are nothing but definitions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , whereas the respective second equalities follow immediately from the hellmann - feynman theorem  @xcite .",
    "of course , this is the standard way in field theory to introduce the order parameter  @xcite .",
    "the decisive step now is to take @xmath45 and @xmath46 as new independent variables .",
    "this is accomplished by performing a legendre transformation of @xmath36 , thus constructing the effective potential  @xcite @xmath47 where the old variables @xmath35 and @xmath43 have to be expressed in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . to this end , combining the definition  ( [ eq : dop ] ) with the expansion  ( [ eq : efe ] ) gives @xmath48\\ ] ] and its complex conjugate , which then yields @xmath49\\ ] ] upon inversion .",
    "inserting , one obtains the effective potential  ( [ eq : dep ] ) as a series in powers of @xmath50 : @xmath51 with coefficients @xmath52 having suppressed their dependence on @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "so far , these elementary considerations still refer to the extended system  ( [ eq : exh ] ) , from which the original bose - hubbard model  ( [ eq : hbh ] ) is recovered by equating @xmath53 . by construction , @xmath35 and @xmath46 on the one hand , and @xmath43 and @xmath45 on the other , each constitute a legendre - conjugated pair  @xcite , so that one also has @xmath54 this is what finally explains why @xmath55 has suggestively been named `` effective potential '' : setting @xmath53 in these equations  ( [ eq : lcp ] ) means that the order parameter @xmath56 describing the actual bose - hubbard system  ( [ eq : hbh ] ) is determined by finding a stationary point of @xmath55 , in the same manner as a mechanical equilibrium is determined by a stationary point of some given mechanical potential , with stable equilibria corresponding to minima .",
    "now we can virtually copy the landau theory of phase transitions : assuming @xmath57 and @xmath0 to be positive , and neglecting higher - order terms of the effective potential  ( [ eq : efp ] ) , the minimum of @xmath55 is found at @xmath58 as long as @xmath59 , which indicates the mott insulator phase .",

    "it is , therefore , quite striking to observe that the elemental 2d bose - hubbard model actually provides the critical exponents of the lambda transition , and it might be interesting to pin down the `` carrier '' of this universality in terms of the process - chain diagrams involved in the computation of the landau coefficients .",
    "is there , perhaps , some simple property of these diagrams which clarifies why the 2d model differs so significantly from the 3d one ?    of course , the ultimate test of universality will also require an experimental high - precision measurement of the critical exponents of the 2d bose - hubbard model , as realized with ultracold atoms in planar optical lattices . besides the experiments referred to in the introduction , recent studies aiming at the single - site addressability of ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite hold a particularly high promise in this respect , since such techniques may allow one to directly measure spatial correlation functions , and thereby to determine the exponents @xmath171 and @xmath35 . in any case ,",
