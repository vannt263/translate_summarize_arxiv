    "a lot of extended models includes a so - called @xmath0 gauge boson - massive neutral vector particle associated with an extra @xmath5 subgroup of underlying group @xcite . in particular , this particle is predicted by numerous grand unification models . in all the models ,",
    "the abelian @xmath0-boson is described by a low - energy @xmath6 gauge subgroup originated in some symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "searching for @xmath0 is one of the goals of future experiments at lhc @xcite , and current ones at tevatron .",
    "it can manifest itself either as a real or a virtual state dependently on the value of its mass .",
    "with this goals keeping in mind , it is reasonable to take into consideration all accessible nowadays information about @xmath0-boson , following from different experiments established at low energies . in particular , in lep searching for @xmath0 it was established a model dependent approach and low bounds on its mass @xmath7 gev and/or @xmath8 gev have been obtained @xcite , which are dependent on a specific model .",
    "no actual signals of the @xmath0 have been detected . in recent experiments at tevatron",
    "the derived low bounds are a little bit larger and correspond to the masses @xmath9 gev @xcite .    on the other hand , in series of papers @xcite@xcite a model independent method of searching for the @xmath0 was developed .",
    "this approach accounts for a renormalizability of an underlying unknown in other respect theory .",
    "the requirement of renormalizability results in a series of relations between low energy parameters describing interactions of the @xmath0 with fermions of the standard model .",
    "this reduces the number of low - energy parameters which must be fitted in experiments . in this way",
    "the couplings of @xmath0 to the fermions of the standard model and the mass @xmath10 were estimated at @xmath11 cl in the one - parameter @xcite and many - parameter @xcite fits .",
    "if these relations are not taken into consideration , no signals ( hints , in fact ) follow .",
    "it was also concluded that the statistics of the lep experiments is not too large to detect the @xmath0 as the virtual state with enough high precision .",
    "so , some further analysis is reasonable .",
    "one needs in the estimates which could be used in future experiments . to determine them in a maximally full way we address to the analysis based on the predictions of the neural networks ( for applications in high energy physics",
    "see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea of this approach is to constrain a given data set in such a way that an amount of the data is considered as an inessential background and omitted .",
    "the remaining data are expected to give a more precise fit of the parameters of interest .",
    "this is the goal of the present investigation .",
    "we treat the full data set on the bhabha scattering process obtained in lep2 experiments by using the neural network method in order to determine the couplings to the fermions and the mass of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "the lack of statistics in lep experiments does not allow the determination of the @xmath0-boson mass with cl more than @xmath12 in one - parameter fit @xcite and more than @xmath13 in two - parameter fit @xcite .",
    "we propose two points to overcome this restriction for the case of the bhabha scattering process when a many parameter fit is applied .",
    "first , an increase in parametric space could be compensated by an increase in the data set , if all possible information is included in consideration . in this paper",
    "we take into consideration the differential cross - sections measured by the l3 collaboration at 183 - 189 gev , opal collaboration at 130 - 207 gev , aleph collaboration at 130 - 183 gev and the cross - sections obtained by the delphi collaboration at energies 189 - 207 gev .",
    "they form the set of differential cross - sections and their uncertainties for the center of mass energies .",
    "second , we use nns to predict the data set of the investigated process with increased statistics .    in experiments ,",
    "the @xmath14 scattering angle is divided into bins where the detectors are placed . for each bin",
    "we have a differential cross - section and an uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 extends the sm and therefore contributes to the differential cross - section @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is a scattering angle , @xmath18 is the contribution coming due to the sm particles and @xmath19 is the contribution due to the @xmath0 presence . in actual calculations , the first term was taken from the results reported by the lep collaborations and the second one has been calculated in the improved born approximation with the relations due to renormalizability been taken into account . in this case",
    "it is possible to construct the observables which uniquely pick out the @xmath0 virtual state @xcite,@xcite .",
    "hence , the signal of the @xmath0 could be searched in the deviation of experimental differential cross - section from the sm differential cross - section .",
    "taking into account all the noted above we prepare the needed experimental data set .",
    "it consists of a differential cross - section for the bhabha process and an uncertainty . in order to use it in our analysis",
    "we subtract from it the sm differential cross - section for the bhabha process . going this way we obtain the data set :    1 .",
    "scattering sector(bin ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath20 - the difference between a measured differential cross - section and the corresponding sm differential cross - section .",
    "@xmath21 - uncertainty .    ) , the others - forward direction ( @xmath22).,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    an overall distribution of the data is shown in fig.[fig : fir ] .",
    "as it is seen , this forms the set of segments determining the value of the cross - section with its uncertainty . to obtain a more strict constraint on the axial - vector @xmath23 and vector @xmath24 couplings squared",
    ", we have to decrease the lengths of segments . for this purpose",
    "the nn analysis is applied .    at first stage ,",
    "the nns were trained to recognize the signal and the background .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath0 to a differential cross - section for the bhabha process obtained within the sm extended by @xmath0 was taken as the signal . analytic expression for this contribution",
    "reads @xcite :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the functions depend on the sm couplings . in actual analysis",
    "they have been calculated with accounting for the relations due to renormalizability .",
    "this contribution was computed for the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "such the choice is based on the results , obtained in @xcite .    as the background we set the deviation from the signal equaled to the redoubled uncertainty of lep2 experimental data .",
    "thus , the network was trained to discard data , which correspond to large deviations from the signal , but include the ones corresponding to the probable signal of the @xmath0 .",
    "the nn processing makes the cutoff of the data .",
    "the cutoff eliminates the data which are assumed to be the background signal .",
    "side by side with the background signals the nn could discard the signal data too .",
    "but total amount of these events is negligibly small as compared to the amount of discarded background points .    to create and train nns the mlpfit program",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "three - layer nns were used , with 2 neurons in input , 10 neurons in hidden and 1 neuron in output layer .    an input vector for the networks consists of the scattering sector and the differential cross - section for this sector . the training algorithm with back propagation of errors",
    "the type of training - with tutor - was applied .",
    "we also worked out a necessary computer program to solve the problem .    during processing , the nns discarded all the data that have produced a less than 0.9 at nn output .",
    "after nn processing , the length of segments was decreased .",
    "the total decrease of them is 3 - 27 percent ( these values vary for different data sets ) .",
    "the comparative general plot of data set before and after the application of the nn is shown in fig.[fig : sec ] .",
    "process data before and after nn processing.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    after nns processing , the data were analyzed by means of the @xmath30 method . denoting an observable by @xmath31",

    "the sum in eq.([hi ] ) refers to either the data in one specific process or the combined data for several processes . by minimizing the @xmath30-function , the maximal - likelihood estimate for the @xmath0 couplings was derived .",
    "the confidence area in the parameter space @xmath36 corresponding to the probability @xmath37 is defined as    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the @xmath37-level of the @xmath30-distribution with 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath30-function for the @xmath24 observable gives @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "the 95% cl area ( @xmath42 ) is shown in fig.[fig : v2 ] . from this area",

    "as one can see , the zero point of @xmath46 is inside the confidence area .",

    "let us assume that the coupling @xmath48 is of the order of the sm gauge couplings , @xmath49 .",
    "then the obtained value @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath50 tev .    in ref .",

    "it is shown in fig.[fig : sec ] how the nn selects data corresponding to the background .",
    "we note once again that the nn discards not only a background but also the signal",
    ". nevertheless , the discarded signal data are negligibly small as compared to the discarded background ones .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath56 and @xmath47 are comparable to the results obtained in @xcite . in this paper",

    "this is signaling a comparably not heavy @xmath0 , that is of interest for the experiments at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "the estimated couplings are also important to analyze the current and future experimental data .    to conclude , we note that the derived predictions of the nns analysis of the two parameter fits are in good agreement with other one - parameter model - independent fits accounting for the @xmath0 gauge boson existence @xcite , @xcite .",
