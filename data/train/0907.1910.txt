    "we shall explain this phenomenon . for this purpose",
    ", we estimate the number of intersections @xmath6 with any given straight line @xmath14 and prove asymptotic formulae for the first and second associated discrete moment of those values . this approach yields new information on the value - distribution of the zeta - function on the critical line .",
    "let @xmath15 .",
    "the functional equation for @xmath3 in its asymmetrical form is given by @xmath16 it is essential for our approach that @xmath17 ( which follows directly from the functional equation and will be frequently used in the sequel ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath18 is on the unit circle for any real @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , it follows that @xmath19 vanishes if and only if either @xmath20 is a zero of the zeta - function or @xmath21 where the last equality is derived by conjugation .",
    "two values for @xmath22 are of special interest here : for @xmath23 the roots of the equation @xmath24 correspond to real values of @xmath11 , whereas @xmath25 yields the purely imaginary values ; this follows immediately from the fact that for such values of @xmath12 @xmath26 the roots @xmath12 of @xmath27 are called gram points after gram @xcite who observed that the first of those roots separate consecutive zeta zeros on the critical line ; we shall discuss our results concerning this aspect in the last but one section . for the roots of @xmath28 which are no ordinates of zeros of the zeta - function we obviously have @xmath29",
    "hence , the roots of @xmath28 correspond to the intersection points of the curve @xmath6 with the straight line @xmath14 through the origin . in this note",
    "we are mainly concerned about the non - zero intersection points .",
    "we expect that all but finitely many of the roots of the two factors of @xmath28 in ( [ vieh ] ) are distinct ( for each fixed value of @xmath22 ) .",
    "since the set of zeros of zeta is countable , there have to exist values of @xmath22 in the uncountable set @xmath30 for which @xmath31 for all ordinates @xmath32 of nontrivial zeros ; however , we can even not exclude the possibility of @xmath33 for a single ordinate @xmath32",

    "all these functions are counting according multiplicities ; it is easy to see that all roots counted by @xmath41 are simple ( see ( [ delt ] ) ) . by a deep result of conrey @xcite ( building on work of levinson @xcite ) , more than two fifths of the zeros of @xmath3",
    "lie on the critical line , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the riemann - von mangoldt counting function for nontrivial zeros without specifying the real part ( for this and for other basics from zeta - function theory we refer to ivi @xcite ) .",
    "first of all , we shall prove an asymptotic formula for the counting function @xmath39 :    [ one ] for any @xmath15 , as @xmath44 , @xmath45 in particular , the set @xmath46 is countable .",
    "if the riemann hypothesis is true ( or if almost all zeta zeros lie on the critical line @xmath47 ) , then theorem [ one ] implies @xmath48 unconditionally , it follows that @xmath49 is the correct order of growth for @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , we shall prove asymptotic formulae for the associated first and second discrete moment :    [ two ] for any @xmath15 , as @xmath44 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "note that the leading main term of the second moment is independent of @xmath22 whereas the first one vanishes for @xmath25 .",
    "these asymptotic formulae provide interesting information for the value - distribution of the zeta - function on the critical line . as an immediate consequence of ( [ conseq ] ) in combination with ( [ vienas ] ) we note    [ drei ] for @xmath15 , @xmath53 if riemann s hypothesis is true ( or if almost all zeta zeros lie on the critical line ) , then the mean - value of the points in @xmath46 exists and is equal to @xmath54 for purely imaginary values the statement is unconditionally true .",
    "the case of purely imaginary values is special because formula ( [ vienas ] ) gives for @xmath25 just an upper bound for the first moment which leads to mean - value zero . for the real values of the zeta - function on the critical line",

    "do not imply this corollary .",
    "finally , we give a lower bound for the number of roots of @xmath68 distinct from ordinates of zeta zeros :    [ funf ] for @xmath69 , as @xmath44 , @xmath70    for @xmath25 , the case of purely imaginary values we do not have any non - trivial lower bound .",
    "it has been conjectured by fujii @xcite that the values @xmath71 are uniformly distributed modulo one ( in the sense of weyl ) , where @xmath72 denotes the @xmath73-th ordinate of the nontrivial zeros of @xmath3 in ascending order .",
    "a proof of this conjecture would certainly yield more information about the quantity estimated in the last corollary .",

    "recall that @xmath18 is a complex number from the unit circle whenever @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , @xmath75 is non - vansishing , which follows from the asymptotic formula @xmath76 consequently , @xmath18 is spinning on the unit circle around the origin in clockwise direction with increasing speed as @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , it follows that there exists no proper real interval @xmath77 such that @xmath11 lies on a straight line @xmath14 for all @xmath78 .",
    "for the first , lets assume that @xmath79 then the number of roots of the equation @xmath24 with @xmath80 is up to the sign equal to the winding number of the curve @xmath81\\to \\c,\\quad \\lambda\\mapsto \\eta(\\lambda):=\\delta({\\textstyle{1\\over 2}}+i\\lambda t).\\ ] ] this yields @xmath82 in order to use ( [ delt ] ) we divide the integration interval into two subintervals .",
    "noting that there are only finitely many roots of @xmath68 for @xmath83 , we find for the term with the integral on the right - hand side above @xmath84 hence , the asymptotic formula for @xmath39 follows by integration ; however , to get rid of our assumption ( [ condit ] ) on @xmath64 , by ( [ delt ] ) we may substitute this by any @xmath64 at the expense of an error @xmath85 .",
    "this proves theorem [ one ] .",
    "the proof relies on a new variation of the method of conrey , ghosh & gonek ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; for our purpose we shall work with the logarithmic derivative of @xmath86 , before only logarithmic derivatives of dirichlet series were treated .",
    "since the nontrivial zeros of the zeta - function do not contribute to the sum in question , we only have to take the roots of @xmath68 into account . denoting those roots by @xmath87 in ascending order @xmath88",
    ", we thus have @xmath89 in view of theorem [ one ] the sequence of these @xmath87 can not lie too dense . as a matter of fact , for any given @xmath90 there exists @xmath91 such that @xmath92 where the minimum is taken over all @xmath87 . for @xmath93 , one has @xmath94 if and only if @xmath95 ( see spira @xcite , resp .",
    "dixon & schoenfeld @xcite for a slight improvement ) . for smaller values of @xmath12",
    "there are roots off the critical line , however , they from a sparse set .",
    "hence , we may assume that there are no roots of @xmath86 on the rectangular contour @xmath96 with corners @xmath97 in counterclockwise direction , where @xmath98 ( if there are roots on the contour we make small indentions at the expense of a bounded error ) . by the calculus of residues , @xmath99 say .",
    "the bounded error term @xmath100 results from at most finitely many possible residues outside @xmath96 , resp .",
    "contributions @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "first we consider @xmath103 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath104 uniformly for any @xmath105 from a bounded interval .",
    "hence , @xmath106 in view of ( [ l2 ] ) the infinite geometric series on the right is converging very quickly for @xmath107 . writing @xmath108 and using ( [ l2 ] ) in combination with ( [ delt ] ) , we easily find @xmath109 the same trick leads to @xmath110 which implies @xmath111 .",
    "the horizontal integral @xmath112 is independent of @xmath64 , so @xmath113 . for @xmath114",
    "we notice that the denominator @xmath115 of the integrand is off the critical line is either dominated by @xmath116 for @xmath117 or by @xmath118 if @xmath119 . on the critical line we have @xmath120 for some integer @xmath121 .",
    "it follows from ( [ l2 ] ) and ( [ condi ] ) that @xmath122 now using ( [ delt ] ) in combination with @xmath123 we may deduce @xmath124 .",
    "the main term of the asymptotic formula comes from the integral @xmath125 which we have to evaluate now . via @xmath126",
    "we find @xmath127 by the reflection principle , @xmath128 in view of the functional equation ( [ feq ] ) the integrand can be rewritten as @xmath129 note that @xmath130 ( again by ( [ feq ] ) ) . with regard to ( [ l2 ] ) this function is small on @xmath131 , and thus we may use the geometric series expansion to find @xmath132 say .",
    "first we consider @xmath133 . according to ( [ delt ] )",
    "we have @xmath134 for the inner integral we use gonek s lemma :    [ gonekl ] suppose that @xmath135 converges for @xmath136 where @xmath137 for any @xmath138 .",
    "then we have , uniformly for @xmath139 , @xmath140    because of the absolute convergence we may interchange the order of summation and integration . for the integral we use lemma 1 from @xcite and for the sum lemma 4 from @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath141 resp .",
    "@xmath142 in order to estimate @xmath143 we use ( [ delt ] ) again and obtain @xmath144 since @xmath98 we have @xmath145 which leads to @xmath146    hence , after conjugation ( because of ( [ conj ] ) ) we arrive at @xmath147 note that @xmath148 and so we have proved the first asymptotic formula ( [ vienas ] ) for any value @xmath64 , satisfying ( [ condi ] ) . to get this uniformly in @xmath64",
    "we allow an arbitrarily @xmath64 at the expense of an error @xmath149 the latter estimate is a trivial consequence of the phragmn - lindelf principle applied to the functional equation .",
    "this proves formula ( [ vienas ] ) .",
    "we can procced in a rather similar way .",
    "assuming the same as for the first moment , we have @xmath150 say .    first we consider @xmath103 . according to ( [ delt ] ) and geometric progression we find similar to the previous case of the first moment @xmath151 since @xmath152 we get @xmath153 by the same argument as for the first moment we find @xmath154 .",
    "again , the integral @xmath125 gives the main contribution . via @xmath126 we find @xmath155 by the functional equation ( [ feq ] ) and the infinite geometric series , @xmath156 we start with @xmath133 . according to ( [ delt ] ) we have @xmath157 using gonek s lemma [ gonekl ] for the inner integral and a standard bound for the dirichlet divisor problem ( see @xcite ) , we find @xmath158 this yields @xmath159    finally we consider @xmath143 . according to ( [ delt ] ) we have @xmath160 since @xmath98 , @xmath161 which leads to @xmath162 collecting together , formula ( [ du ] ) of the theorem follows in just the same way as the first moment asymptotics .",
    "this finishes the proof of theorem [ two ] .",
    "if the riemann hypothesis is true , @xmath163 by ( [ conseq ] ) , hence the existence and the formula for the mean - value follows immediately from ( [ vienas ] ) .",
    "if @xmath25 the main term of ( [ vienas ] ) vanishes and , using the unconditional bound @xmath164 in place of the unproved riemann hypothesis , we get in this case @xmath165 consequently , the mean - value is zero for @xmath25 .",
    "unconditionally , one has to use ( [ peter ] ) to derive the bounds for @xmath166 and @xmath167 as in the corollary .      by theorem [ one ] and [ two ] , @xmath168 and @xmath169 suppose that @xmath170 with some positive constant @xmath171 for all terms in the latter sum , then we obtain the trivial bound @xmath172 in order to have no contradiction with the right - hand side of ( [ u ] ) , we find @xmath173 . consequently , in any interval",
    "@xmath63 $ ] for sufficiently large @xmath64 , there exists a value @xmath12 such that @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "if all those values @xmath176 would be negative , we would get a contradiction to ( [ vienas ] ) . in the purely imaginary case",
    "we get large values with both signs according to ( [ uui ] ) .",
    "this proves the corollary .      applying the cauchy - schwarz inequality , @xmath177 inserting the asymptotic formulae of theorem [ two ] yields the assertion of the corollary .",
    "the roots of the equation @xmath178 constitute the so - called gram points @xmath179 which are usually defined by the roots of the equation @xmath180 for @xmath181 , where @xmath182 .",
    "the function @xmath183 is real - valued for real @xmath12 and gram s law states that @xmath184 in fact , each sign change of the real valued function @xmath185 corresponds to a zero and the number of gram points matches with the number of nontrivial zeros ; by theorem [ one ] we have @xmath186 . as gram observed in 1903 for the first zeta zeros , consecutive ordinates of nontrivial zeros are separated by a gram point and vice versa ; it should be mentioned that gram himself seemed to doubt that this separation would persist indefinitely ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; page 127 ) .",
    "the first failure of gram s law appears for @xmath187 , as discovered by hutchinson @xcite .",
    "it was first shown by titchmarsh @xcite that gram s law is violated infinitely often , and , recently , trudgian @xcite has proved that it fails for a postive proportion of values of @xmath73 as @xmath188 . since @xmath189 if and only if @xmath12 is a gram point for which gram s law is not true , it follows that there exist infinitely many intersections of the curve @xmath55 with the negative real axis and we may ask whether those points all lie in a bounded interval or not .",
    "this seems to be a difficult question which is of particular interest with respect to the conjectured denseness of @xmath6 in the complex plane .",
    "our results have also an impact on previous research on gram points .",
    "titchmarsh @xcite proved @xmath190 for any @xmath191 as @xmath192 , which implies already the existence of infinitely many nontrivial zeros on the critical line ; moreover , he conjectured @xmath193 for some constant @xmath194 .",
    "the latter estimate was proved by moser @xcite with @xmath195 . for this aim",
    "he showed the stronger estimate @xmath196 next we shall derive a lower bound for this expression .",
    "using @xmath197 the asymptotic formulae from theorem [ two ] translate to @xmath198 the first formula above was already found by titchmarsh @xcite ( with a different method ) . by the cauchy - schwarz inequality , @xmath199 substituting the asymptotic formula ( [ mosel ] ) implies    as @xmath192 , @xmath200",
    "we conclude with a few heuristical remarks . in corollary [ drei ]",
    "we have proved the existence and explicit values for the mean of @xmath11 on straight lines @xmath14 passing through the origin .",
    "their positivity has confirmed an observation by edwards ( mentioned in the introduction ) . the symmetry with respect to the real line is well reflected in the vanishing main term of the first moment ( [ vienas ] ) for @xmath25 whereas the non - vanishing of the second moment ( [ du ] ) implies the existence of infinitely many non - zero values @xmath11 on the imaginary axis .",
    "next we compute from corollary [ drei ] , under assumption of the riemann hypothesis , the mean of all individual mean - values by integration over @xmath22 : @xmath201 here we have used ( [ zvaigzde ] ) for expressing the individual mean - value from corollary [ drei ] in a more convenient expression for the integration with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "this is of special interest with respect to another discrete moment considered by garunktis & steuding recently . in @xcite , they have proved that , for any fixed complex number @xmath202 , as @xmath44 , @xmath203 where the summation is over nontrivial roots @xmath204 of the equation @xmath205 , the numbers @xmath206 are the stieltjes constants ( defined by the laurent expansion of @xmath3 around @xmath207 ) , and the error term is @xmath208 with some absolute positive constant @xmath209 ; if the riemann hypothesis is true , then @xmath210 . for @xmath211",
    "the main term is of lower order which is related to the curve @xmath55 not passing as often as for any other value of @xmath202 through the point @xmath212 in the complex plane . roughly speaking",
    ", it seems that for any @xmath22 the set @xmath46 splits up into two subsets of approximately equal size consisting of elements having either very small or large absolute value ; the mean @xmath56 separates these sets and the quantity @xmath212 is the average over all these mean - values .",
    "it is easy to extend the obtained results to dirichlet @xmath213-functions ( with very similar results ) , whereas the case of higher degree @xmath213-functions seems to be rather difficult to handle .",
    "this is already visible in the case of dedekind zeta - functions @xmath214 to quadratic number fields for which conrey , ghosh & gonek @xcite succeeded to prove the existence of infinitely many simple zeros by factoring @xmath215 , where @xmath213 is the dirichlet @xmath213-function to the character associated with @xmath216 , and using the symmetry of the zeros of the zeta - function .",
