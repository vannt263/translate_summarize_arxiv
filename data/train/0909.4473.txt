    "thus a measurement of @xmath5 allows one to determine the decay constant  @xmath6 .",
    "this can be compared to qcd lattice calculations , which have become relatively precise . for the @xmath0 , the ckm matrix element @xmath7",
    "is known to only 9% ; this is nonetheless more precise than measurements of @xmath8 and allows one to extract  @xmath9 .",
    "belle has done two  analyses  @xcite ; the most recent one used 605  fb@xmath10 of data and obtained evidence for a signal .",
    "this analysis employed a semileptonic tag : one @xmath11 in an event is fully reconstructed as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the signal decays @xmath15 and @xmath16 are then searched for by reconstructing a single track not associated with the tag side .",
    "the signal yield is obtained by fitting the distribution of @xmath17 , which is the energy sum of calorimeter clusters not associated with a charged track .",
    "a peak near @xmath18 indicates a @xmath19 or @xmath16 decay .",
    "the main backgrounds are @xmath20 processes and @xmath21 continuum events .",
    "the fit is unbinned and uses a likelihood function @xmath22 where @xmath23 runs over all events ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 runs over all signal and background categories , @xmath26 is the yield of category @xmath25 , and @xmath27 is the probability density function ( pdf ) for category @xmath25 . the branching fraction is calculated as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the reconstruction efficiency as calculated from monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",

    "the babar hadronic - tag analysis is more complicated .",

    "the belle analysis of  decays  @xcite uses 548  fb@xmath10 of data and searches for @xmath63 , where the primary @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be charged or neutral ; the @xmath66 is `` reconstructed '' ( see below ) via @xmath67 ; @xmath68 signifies any number of additional pions and up to one photon ( from fragmentation ) ; the @xmath64 is reconstructed via @xmath69 , where @xmath70 ; and neutral kaons are reconstructed via @xmath71 . if the primary @xmath65 is charged , both it and the @xmath64 must have flavors opposite to that of the @xmath1 ; these constitute a `` right - sign '' ( rs ) sample .",
    "if the flavors are not both opposite , the event is categorized as `` wrong - sign '' ( ws ) and used to parameterize the background .",
    "the same classification applies to primary neutral @xmath65 events , except for these only the @xmath64 flavor must be opposite to that of the @xmath1 for the event to be classified as rs .    the decay sequence is identified via a recoil mass technique .",
    "first , the recoil mass of the @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath72 particles is calculated and required to be within 150  of @xmath73 ; then the @xmath74 is included and the recoil mass is required to be within 150  of @xmath75 ; and finally , the @xmath76 is included and the recoil mass required to be within 0.55  of zero .",

    "[ fig : widhalm1 ] ; a sharp peak is observed near zero , indicating  decay .    , from belle  @xcite . ]",
    "the analysis is complicated by the fact that the recoil mass technique is very sensitive to the number of tracks in an event and the track reconstruction efficiency , as all tracks must be reconstructed for the recoil mass to be accurate . as it is difficult to simulate track multiplicity accurately due to uncertainties in quark fragmentation , the data is divided into bins of @xmath78 , the number of `` primary particles '' reconstructed in an event . here , a primary particle is one that is not a daughter of any particle reconstructed in the event .",
    "the minimum value for @xmath78 is three , corresponding to @xmath79 without any additional particles from fragmentation .",
    "the data is then fit in two dimensions , @xmath80 recoil mass vs. @xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : widhalm2 ] ) . the signal pdf is obtained from mc and modeled separately for different values of @xmath81 , the _ true _ number of primary particles in an event ( @xmath81 can differ from @xmath78 due to particles being lost or incorrectly assigned ) .",
    "the branching fraction is obtained from two fits : the first fit uses the @xmath80 recoil mass spectrum and yields the number of @xmath1 candidates ; the result is @xmath82 . for this fit",
    "the background shape is taken from the ws sample and the background levels floated in the fit .",
    "the second fit uses the @xmath77 recoil mass spectrum and yields the number of  candidates ; the result is @xmath83 . for this fit",
    "the background shape is taken from a rs `` @xmath84 '' sample , i.e. , all selection criteria are the same except that an electron candidate is required instead of a muon candidate .",
    "as true @xmath84 decays are suppressed by @xmath85 , this sample provides a good model of the  background .",
    "the systematic errors listed are dominated by uncertainties in the signal and background pdfs and are obtained by varying the shapes of these pdfs .",
    "the branching fraction is the ratio @xmath86 , corrected for the ratio of reconstruction efficiencies .",

    "a photon is required and paired with the @xmath1 candidate to make a @xmath96 , and the mass difference @xmath97 is calculated .",
    "the data is subsequently divided into four subsamples : a tag - side mass sideband and a tag - side signal region for @xmath76 and @xmath98 candidates .",
    "for both lepton samples , the tag - side - sideband @xmath99 spectrum is subtracted from the tag - side - signal @xmath99 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dsmunu_babar1 ] ) , and then the sideband - subtracted @xmath98 spectrum is subtracted from the sideband - subtracted @xmath76 spectrum . the final @xmath99 distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dsmunu_babar2]a ) is fit with signal and background pdfs ; the signal yield obtained is @xmath100 events .    to determine the branching fraction , the signal yield is normalized to  decays . like the signal mode",

    "the signal yield obtained is @xmath102 events .",
    "dividing @xmath103 by @xmath104 and correcting for the ratio of reconstruction efficiencies gives @xmath105    for this analysis , the @xmath106 is reconstructed via @xmath107 with @xmath108  @xcite .",
    "conveniently , cleo has measured the branching fraction @xmath109 for @xmath110 ; the result is @xmath111  @xcite . to multiply the two results together to obtain @xmath5 requires dividing eq .",

    "in addition , babar has subtracted off a small amount of @xmath114 background ( 48 events ) ; as this process is included in the cleo measurement , these events must be added back in to babar s @xmath115 yield .",
