    "a traditional point - contact ( pc ) spectroscopy of the electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) @xcite assumes that both electrodes forming a @xmath1-contact are in a normal state at low temperatures .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to transform many actual superconductors to a normal state .",
    "spectra of @xmath2 and @xmath3-point - contacts in some cases contain an additional structure in the region of phonon energies , and a form of such spectra is quite complicated and on occasion is far from traditional .",
    "a transformation into a normal state of electrodes forming a point - contact often leads to disappearance of such a structure .",
    "it can be explained by the fact that the spectrum in a normal state and the additional nonlinearity arising at a transition to a superconducting state are determined by scattering processes in geometrically different regions of a point - contact .    in a normal state",
    "the contribution to a spectrum is _ backscattering processes _ at which an electron returns to the same half space from which it flew out @xcite .",
    "a main contribution to a spectrum is formed by processes of scattering of electrons in a volume with a diameter of the order of a point - contact",
    ". indeed , for a contact in the model of an aperture with a diameter @xmath4 a probability of the return in the case of the scattering is maximal in a center of the contact and is 0.5 . since in an isotropic case a direction of the electron flight after",
    "scattering is equally possible , on a large distance @xmath5 from the contact plane the probability of the return does not exceed a ratio of the contact area to the surface area of a sphere with a center at the scattering point and the radius @xmath6 , and is @xmath7(d/4r)@xmath8 .",
    "thus , on the distance @xmath9 this probability is @xmath10 times lower than in the contact center , and for @xmath11 it is @xmath12 times lower .",
    "a maximal concentration of nonequilibrium phonons is achieved in the region of maximal density of the current and decreases fast with its spreading .",
    "so in the first approximation at large distances from a narrowing the point - contact can be considered as a point source of phonons , and their density decreases @xmath13 .",
    "however , the largest part of phonons is still generated in edges in the amount of the order of the energy relaxation length of nonequilibrium electrons , which depends on their energy .",
    "the inelastic mean free path of electrons can be estimated by the formula @xmath14 , @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the eliashberg thermodynamic function . note that if a metal has a few groups of electrons , then in the estimation it is necessary to use the fermi velocity for the group which determines its transport characteristics . by the way , this note is also valid for the expressions given in sec .",
    "ii for an estimation of the potential barrier appearing at an interface of two metals due to a mismatch of their fermi parameters .",
    "obviously , that the scattering of nonequilibrium electrons by phonons in edges does not affect the pc spectrum in a normal state .",
    "an inelastic superconducting addition in the spectrum is determined by processes of scattering of electrons , undergoing the andreev reflection , by nonequilibrium phonons , and _ any scattering process _",
    "is effective .",
    "since the probability of reabsorption of nonequilibrium phonons by electrons experiencing the andreev reflection depends on the concentration of phonons , from the above estimation it is clear that the contribution to the superconducting inelastic spectrum decays more slowly with increasing the distance from the aperture than the contribution to the normal spectrum .",
    "besides , not taking into account phonons created in edges would be too rough approximation , since the andreev reflection takes place in a volume of the order of the coherence length , which is , in the cases under discussion , considerably larger than the diameter of the point - contact , and is comparable to the inelastic relaxation length at the debye energies .",
    "estimations for the concentration of nonequilibrium phonons depending on an applied voltage are reported in ref . for a nb point - contact .",
    "it seems that a relative integral contribution of the peripheral regions of a contact in the inelastic superconducting addition in the spectrum for superconductors with a sufficiently strong epi can be comparable with the contribution of the central regions .",
    "therefore , if the contribution to the spectrum of the point - contact central regions is `` turned off '' somehow , the remained nonlinearity will almost entirely be determined by the superconducting addition to the spectrum of peripheral regions .",
    "taking into account that the impurities and defects disturbing the crystal structure of the material under investigation are usually concentrated near the surface , and considering that in the process of forming point - contacts additional distortions of the lattice are introduced , significantly lower quality of the material near the contact center can be expected .",
    "this leads to a blurring of the normal spectrum and a decrease in its intensity , and to the complete suppression of it for a very strong distortion of the lattice . at the same time edges of the contact",
    "can remain quite clean , and the superconducting addition to the spectrum will reflect properties of the bulk material .",
    "we note in passing that the observed high level of the background for some pc spectra in a normal state , which can not be described within the framework of the existing theory of reabsorption of nonequilibrium phonons @xcite , possibly is also related to the presence of a strongly distorted layer with a thickness smaller than the diameter of the contact .",
    "the aim of this work is reconstruction of the pc function of the epi from the superconducting addition to the spectrum using clean point - contacts of ta as an example .",
    "then , using algorithms obtained for ta , the functions of the epi for 2h - nbse@xmath0 and mgb@xmath0 are restored , spectra of which in a normal state are absent or blurred very much .",
    "the authors of ref . have extended a theory of the pc spectroscopy to @xmath3 contacts . in this case",
    "it has been assumed that @xmath3 contacts satisfy the following conditions :    @xmath17    @xmath18    these conditions mean that characteristic dimensions of the contact are smaller than the momentum mean free path @xmath19 and the coherence length @xmath20 , the energy mean free path @xmath21 up to energies @xmath22 , ( @xmath23 for @xmath24 ) .",

    "it is noted that for ballistic contacts nonlinearity of the ivc of the elastic origin can be comparable to inelastic point - contact contributions . obviously that for point - contacts with a large tunneling parameter @xmath92 it is exactly an elastic contribution will be prevalent .",

    "it has been assumed that this effect can be related to decreasing the current of quasiparticles upon combining some electrons responsible for the excess current into cooper pairs during the andreev reflection , since the epi in the contact is connected with a quasiparticle component of the total current .",
    "it is necessary to note here that the shown spectrum satisfies the conditions and and is similar to most intensive spectra described in ref .. nevertheless , upon a transition to a superconducting state noticeable distinctions from predictions of the theory are observed .",

    "instead of broadening , the peak close to 11@xmath11912  mv becomes sharper abruptly , but the distinctions in the vicinity of 18  mv are already not so pronounced .",
    "the sharpening of the peaks can be caused by a high concentration of nonequilibrium phonons with small group velocities which leave the contact region slowly .",
    "their velocities correspond to the frequencies at which the density of states is maximal .",
    "the probability of reabsorption of phonons by electrons exhibiting the andreev reflection increases with the phonons concentration .",

    "participate in inelastic backscattering processes in a broader area of the phase space , and the position of maxima in the spectrum can change depending on orientation of the contact axis with respect to the crystallographic axes .",
    "in addition , the greatest distinction of the curves in figs .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] exactly in the region of small displacements can be due to the fact that an effect of the superconducting form - factor entering to @xmath44 was not taken into account in calculating the convolution in fig.[fig1 ] ( curve @xmath83 ) , see eq . .",
    "as it was mentioned in introduction it is just in the region of small displacements on the contact an effect of the superconducting form - factor manifests itself most pronouncedly , and the main contribution to the current is made by processes of scattering without changing the @xmath125-component of the velocity , of the type of the andreev reflection .",
    "the absence of the sharpening of phonon peaks in the pc spectra of in and sn upon a transition to a superconducting state @xcite is an indirect indication of a small contribution of the region close to the contact in the inelastic superconducting spectrum . for these superconductors",
    "the energy relaxation length at energies of phonon peaks is higher than that in ta , and in spite of a small group velocity of such phonons their concentration in edges in the vicinity of contractions is insignificant to affect noticeably a form of the spectrum . at the same time in the region of intensive generation of phonons",
    "the selection on the basis of the phonon group velocity is not so efficient due to a small size of the current concentration region .",
    "the presence in the @xmath30 spectrum of the gap and nonequilibrium features as well as changing the form of the spectrum and the reduced background makes it not possible to restore the function of the epi from the curve @xmath126 via simple integration .",
    "so , to compensate the influence of all neglected factors before integrating it is necessary to subtract the background as it is done for restoring the function of the epi from a spectrum of a normal state . since at energies above the debye ones the function of the epi turns to zero , * the curve after subtracting the background should become to be zero at these energies .",
    "* the second necessary condition is an absence of a background on the curve obtained as a result of integration . to fulfill this condition",
    "* the areas under the curve after background subtraction should be the same above and below an abscissa axis . * note that above mentioned requirements are satisfied for different forms of a background curve .",
    "however , the variations do not lead to significant changes of the form and positions of phonon characteristics of a restored function of the epi @xmath127 pc .",
    "so for a rough estimate of the epi function , it is enough to plot a background curve freehand .",
    "because the gap and nonequilibrium features do not allow to reconstruct correctly a trend of the curve in the range from 0 to @xmath76  mv , this part was approximated by a parabola segment . in order to prevent from additional misrepresentations",

    "we note in passing that the restored function of the epi @xmath127 is close enough in form to the epi function of a superconducting state , which could be obtained from the @xmath30spectrum in fig.[fig2 ] ( a ) by subtracting a traditional background .",
    "the investigation of the epi spectra of 2h - nbse@xmath128 in a superconducting state is presented in ref .. we emphasize here that this compound is very difficult for experiments due to a strong dependence of the point - contact spectra on the quality of initial samples of single crystals .",
    "for example , one of the first single crystals investigated by us had a resistance ratio @xmath129/@xmath12330 .",
    "point - contacts based on these single crystals were characterized by a very low noise level up to the resistance of 1 k@xmath108 . at the same time the point - contacts based on single crystals with @xmath129/@xmath123100 and having the resistance higher than 10@xmath11920@xmath108 , in most cases had a very high level of noise that did not allow to use them for studying the epi .",
    "a possible reason for this is incommensurate charge density waves ( cdws ) that exist in this compound . in the former case the single crystals are not perfect enough , and there are effective pinning centers , preventing their movement . in the later case",

    "the reason for the phonon features to appear only in a superconducting state is apparently associated with a technology of manufacturing the pcs .",

    "thus , the contact pads of the electrodes were machined , and a crystal structure of 2h - nbse@xmath0 on a site of the cut was largely broken .",
    "consequently , the point - contact is very inhomogeneous ; there are clean edges and a dirty core with a strongly distorted lattice with a short mean free path of electrons . in a normal state ,",

    "the convolution presented coincides perfectly in a form with the data obtained by us , however so high intensity of two - phonon processes is unclear to us . on the other hand , for much higher frequencies the peaks observed on our curves are in good agreement with flat parts of the calculated dispersion curves , where @xmath138/@xmath139q=0 in the feldman theoretical model for a dynamic matrix @xcite ( in the figure the first model is presented ) , as well as with the calculations in ref .. the exception is the most high - energy peak at @xmath760  mv .",
    "possible causes of this peak are discussed in ref .. a position of the phonon features in our spectra correlates well with the data of experimental works on the inelastic neutron scattering and the raman spectra .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental neutron data for this compound is generally limited to the study of low - energy phonon branches .",
    "the small variations observed in the position of the phonon features at @xmath71@xmath1192  mv are apparently related both to an accuracy of the theoretical model and an influence of the superconducting energy gap in our data .",
    "note that recently the point - contact functions of the epi have been obtained for the 2h - tase@xmath0-compound belonging to the same crystallographic group @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that a boundary of the phonon spectrum in this compound is greater than 70  mv .      for the analysis , the superconducting pc spectra of mgb@xmath0 ( fig.[fig5 ] ) , reported in refs .",
    ", were used .",

    ", as well as assumed background curves . for clarity ,",
    "the curves are shifted vertically.,width=302 ]    the spectra were obtained by touching a massive silver electrode to the film of mgb@xmath0 and represent an intermediate case between ta and 2h - nbse@xmath0 for the appearance of features in a normal state .",
    "for the point - contacts similar to those shown in fig.[fig5 ] , in the normal state the weakly pronounced highly blurred features are observed in the region of the phonon energies with a high - level background @xcite .",
    "the residual resistivity of the film was 6@xmath9710@xmath122 cm , that corresponds to the elastic mean free path of 4 nm .",
    "the diameters of the given contacts are estimated to be 4.4 , 3.9 , 3.8 , 2.2 , and 1.9  nm ( 36 , 43 , 45 , 110 , 150 @xmath108 ) respectively .",
    "thus , the estimates are very close to the estimated diameter of 2h - nbse@xmath0 , and the values of the elastic mean free path in the contact region in the mgb@xmath0 is found to be several times larger .",
    "such estimates are quite reasonable , considering that we almost do not make additional lattice distortions .",
    "when a background is subtracted form the curves in a superconducting state , we were guided by the conditions specified in subsec.a and highlighted by bold .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] shows the second derivatives of the ivc and the background curves , and fig.[fig6 ] demonstrates the difference curves .",
    "( fig.[fig5 ] ) after subtracting background .",
    "parts of the curve up to @xmath718  mv are approximated by a parabola.,width=302 ]    as can be seen , the background curves are not monotonic as in the case of 2h - nbse@xmath0 , and contain one or two blurred maxima .",
    "note that presented in ref .",
    "point - contact spectra of the epi in a normal state as a whole are similar to the curves represented by the background curves and contain the blurred maximum at around @xmath760  mv .",
    "the point - contact spectra of mgb@xmath0 in a superconducting state were interpreted in ref . from the point of view of an energy dependence of the superconducting order parameter @xmath140(@xmath91 ) .",

    "so we compare with the point - contact function g@xmath144(ev ) for zrb@xmath0 ( ref . )",
    "belonging to the same crystallographic group . as can be seen ,",
    "the functions are very similar in shape and position of the phonon features which for the averaged spectrum are at the energies by 4@xmath1195  mv smaller than for zrb@xmath0 , with the exception of the first peak shifted to the higher energies by @xmath716  mv .",
    "this is understandable , since this mode is associated with vibrations of the zr ions , the atomic mass of which is @xmath73.75 times greater than that of the mg ions",
    ". the calculated functions of the epi g@xmath142(ev ) ( refs . are notably different in form .",
    "however , their comparison with the average pc function @xmath141 demonstrates a close value in the energy of individual branches of the spectrum . as for the tunneling function of the epi g@xmath143(ev),@xcite it can be assumed that the maximum at 58  mv corresponds to the peaks at 46 and 66  mv of our averaged functions .",
    "these peaks for the tunneling contact could not be resolved due to insufficient quality of the superconducting film .",
    "this assumption can also be supported by softening the high - energy peaks from 90 to 85  mv .",
    "a comparison of the function of the phonon density of states , both calculated f@xmath142(ev ) and obtained from the neutron data f@xmath143(ev),@xcite with our demonstrates a good correlation in a position of phonon peaks .",
    "in general , it can be concluded that the method used can accurately restore a form of the epi function from superconducting point - contact spectra .",
    "as experiments demonstrate the method is effective for metals both with a large coherence length and with rather short one . for clarity ,",
    "the characteristic parameters of the point - contacts considered in this paper are given in the summary table .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    based on the above material , we can conclude that an interpretation of superconducting spectra is most straightforward in two limiting cases :    1",
    ".   for ballistic point - contacts in which the relative contribution to the spectrum of a superconducting component , as follows from the khlus theory,@xcite is small and retains the overall spectrum shape , sufficiently close to a normal state ; 2 .   for point - contacts with a very dirty core and clean edges .",
    "theoretically , a decrease of the elastic mean free path in the contact region should lead only to a decrease in the intensity of the spectrum and should not affect its shape .",
    "but in reality , such a decrease of the mean free path is caused by either impurities or defects and distortions of a crystal lattice . in any case",
    ", this is a violation of short - range order , accompanied by a blurring the spectrum . in the limiting case for amorphization of a contact region",
    "the spectrum may be absent completely , but the contact will not go into a heating regime . if edges at the same time remain clean , after subtracting a background the spectrum is easily obtained from the first derivative of the excess current .",
    "note that to realize the situation of dirty narrowing and clean edges is quite difficult .",
    "most often , edges also appear to be with the short - range order breaking . a theory for the diffusion limit",
    "is presented in ref .. the solution is obtained only for a long channel model ( bridge ) , provided that the bridge and the adjacent edge areas contain large amounts of impurities . in the diffusion limit , as in pure point - contacts , there are processes at which electrons injected into a superconductor in the process of the andreev reflection interact with nonequilibrium phonons , giving rise to a `` back current . '' in addition , the contribution to the conductivity is made by processes such as relaxation of charge imbalance and the virtual processes that are sensitive to the frequency dependence of the epi function . in ref .",
    "it is emphasized that these additional channels are observed only for the geometry of a dirty bridge with a massive superconductor .",
    "obviously , in most cases , this geometry has little to do with a real experimental situation . departing from the bridge geometry and considering the actual spatial dependence of all quantities in the problem for a transition from a narrowing to massive edges complicates significantly the problem and still has not found a solution .",
    "nevertheless , it is obvious that a decrease of the elastic mean free path in the vicinity of a narrowing reduces much faster a normal component of the spectrum than superconducting .",
    "therefore , upon a transition from normal to superconducting state an intensity of the spectra of the epi increases in such point - contacts .",
    "an example of such a transformation of spectra can be observed in refs .. an intermediate regime , close to diffusion one , is very difficult to interpret . in this regime ,",
    "both contributions are similar in intensity , and the normal spectrum has a small blur .",
    "a superposition of contributions of similar intensity greatly distorts a shape of the resulting spectrum , and separation of its superconducting part without carrying the contact to a normal state is a highly non - trivial task @xcite .",
    "a complicating factor is a possibility of appearing on the derivatives of the cvc the nonspectral features of the thermal and nonequilibrium origin , related to the destruction of superconductivity in the contact region due to the spatial inhomogeneity of a superconductor . to exclude from the consideration such features",
    "there should be some statistics of the spectra , since these features are not sufficiently reproducible .",
    "in addition , in contrast to the spectral , their position on an energy axis , are generally more dependent on temperature .",
    "a position of the spectral features of the excess current on an energy axis depends on the gap value and , hence , the temperature .",
    "however , taking into account that the gap starts to decrease significantly only at t@xmath1452/3t@xmath94 , in some temperature range this position can be considered practically constant .",
    "in addition to the above - noted difficulty of separating the normal and superconducting contributions to the spectrum and excluding the nonspectral features , the empirical method of subtracting the superconducting background is rather arbitrary yet . the problem of obtaining quantitative information from the spectrum , especially in the case of irregular distribution of impurities , is not solved .",
    "while in the simplest cases for materials with a large coherence length , the purity of the contact can be judged by a value of the excess current , in the compounds with small @xmath146 the excess current is influenced by other mechanisms in addition to the andreev reflection .",
    "therefore , in complicated cases of the greatest practical interest , such as high - temperature superconductors , this information will only be of a provisional character .",
    "note that in the case of a short coherence length and a relatively low critical current density in the current state , in the vicinity of the point - contact there can be phase - slip surfaces preventing the observation of phonon features @xcite .",
    "thus , though the pc superconducting spectroscopy is not as universal as a traditional , in some cases it is more efficient .",
    "first of all , these are compounds which are difficult to take to a normal state , as well as compounds in which in a normal state the spectra of the epi are generally of poor quality or absent at all , as , for example , in nbse@xmath0 .",
    "1 .   using a ta point - contact as an example",
    "it was shown that it is possible in principle to reconstruct the point - conact function of the epi from the first derivative of the excess current .",
    "it was found that the restored pc function of the epi differs in form from the epi function of a normal state , and the largest differences are observed at low energies .",
    "an explanation of the observed differences was proposed .",
    "2 .   from the pc spectra in a superconducting state , for the first time",
    "the function of the epi was reconstructed in 2h - nbse@xmath0 .",
    "a position of phonon peaks in the epi function agrees well with the flat parts of calculated dispersion curves .",
    "3 .   the pc functions of the epi in mgb@xmath0 , restored from superconducting spectra for the first time , show good reproducibility .",
    "a comparison with related functions of the density of phonon states , f(x ) , tunneling and calculated functions of the epi shows a small shift of main phonon peaks to lower energies in full agreement with theoretical predictions .    in conclusion , we wish to thank yu .",
