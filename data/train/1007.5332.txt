    "what are the forces that stabilize aggregates of amyloid peptide molecules ? this question is of interest because of the putative role played by amyloid aggregation in diseases such as alzheimer s , parkinson s , mad cow and type ii diabetes @xcite .",
    "amyloid appears to aggregate into at least two different states : _ amyloid oligomers _ , which are small few - chain soluble disordered clusters , and _ fibrils _ , which are long many - chain highly structured @xmath1-sheet - like aggregates .",
    "the view has recently emerged that the oligomers may be the toxic species , not the fibrils , as had been expected because of the appearance of plaques in disease @xcite .",
    "it has been challenging to understand the physical principles of amyloid aggregation , in part because of a lack of reductionist experimental model systems . in this breach",
    ", we believe that simple models can help guide and interpret experiments .    the first challenge is to disentangle how much of amyloid formation can be explained by equilibrium _ vs. _ kinetics .",
    "often kinetics is easier to study experimentally because measuring rates does not require finding conditions of reversibility . yet",
    ", there is experimental evidence of multiple stable states : monomers , oligomers , and fibrils , and perhaps a precursor to the fibrillar state , called the protofilament @xcite .",
    "we believe insights can be gained from first understanding the underlying phase equilibria .",
    "we develop here a model of the equilibrium among the following states : ( a ) isolated monomeric amyloid peptide molecules in solution , ( b ) few - chain noncovalent aggregates _ ( oligomers ) _ of amyloid peptide molecules , ( c ) the single ` macroscopic thread ' called a _ protofilament _ , which is a noncovalent ordered assembly of many chains , and ( d ) the _ fibril _ , which is a bundle of protofilaments .",

    "this provides a rationale for understanding how a single mutation could transform a normal fibrillization rate , which might be too slow to cause disease on a human lifetime , into a much faster fibrillization rate , sufficient to cause disease during a human lifetime .",
    "our model of the amyloid nucleation process differs from classic nucleation mechanisms in two respects : ( 1 ) ours involves a one - dimensional line tension , rather than a two - dimensional surface tension @xcite , and ( 2 ) our ordering transition is from oligomers to fibrils , not from monomers to aggregates , so our fibrillization mechanism is not driven by increasing the solution concentration of monomers .",
    "this is consistent with experiments showing that amyloid nucleation is concentration - independent .",
    "the proposed explanation in the nucleated conformational conversion ( ncc ) model @xcite is that oligomeric chains must enter an _ activated conformation _ to proceed to fibrils . in our model ,",

    "peptides are frequently folded within a fibril such that a single peptide chain contributes multiple @xmath1-strands to the fibril . to account for this we introduce the parameters @xmath49 , the length of each @xmath1-strand , and @xmath50 , the number of @xmath1 strands formed by each peptide chain .",
