    "because the power in the higher wavenumber domain is affected by the instrumental spatial resolution , it is necessary to calibrate the optical transfer function to obtain the shape of the power spectra on the solar surface . the modulation transfer function ( mtf ) of the instrument",

    "[ f1 ] have significant power in the wavenumber range higher than 5  mm@xmath31 . the residual power in the high wavenumber range is mainly attributed to noises in the observed maps .",
    "the power due to the noises should be subtracted for calibrating the mtf , otherwise higher power appears erroneously in that range .",
    "when the data has a spatially uncorrelated white noise in a two - dimensional map , the noise spectrum @xmath43 is expected to be proportional to @xmath4 in one - dimensional power spectra .",

    "the velocity power spectrum @xmath50 averaged in the quiet regions look very similar , as is shown in the top panel of fig .",

    "higher than the granular scale , i.e. in the spatial scale smaller than granules , the power spectra appear to be obeying the power - law ( i. e. @xmath52 ) .",

    "such mesogranular - scale magnetic structures might be related with the residual magnetic power in the intermediate scale , though we need careful analysis including horizontal velocities that we can not obtain only with the sp data .    in the wavenumber range",

    "when @xmath81 ( steeper than @xmath83 ) , the total magnetic energy mainly comes from the power at the lower wavenumber , @xmath84 . on the other hand , the total magnetic energy mainly comes from the power at the upper wavenumber , @xmath85 , when @xmath82 ( less steep than @xmath83 ) .",
    "the power - law indices of the magnetic power spectra obtained in the internetwork regions are close to or smaller than @xmath86 in the wavenumber range higher than @xmath64  mm@xmath31 .",
    "this means that the total magnetic energy mainly comes from either the granular - scale ( @xmath70  mm@xmath31 ) magnetic structures or both the granular - scale and smaller ones contributing evenly .",
    "recent numerical simulations of the surface magneto - convection suggested that turbulent fields were created by small - scale dynamo action , and a significant amount of unsigned flux was not detected at the spatial resolution of the hinode sp because of cancellation of polarization signals from opposite magnetic polarities .",
    "these numerical simulations indicated positive slopes of the magnetic power spectra toward the small scales even at the spatial scale smaller than granules .",
    "the slopes do not agree with the magnetic power spectra presented in this article . if we extrapolate the observed slope @xmath87 of the magnetic power spectra up to @xmath88  mm@xmath31 , an order of magnitude higher than the hinode sp resolution , the magnetic power in the observed wavenumber range between 1 and 4 mm@xmath31 is about 50  % of the power between 1 and 50  mm@xmath31 , which is not as small as the percentage suggested by @xcite . because we can not argue behavior of the power spectra in unresolved scales based on these data , it is critical to use high - resolution data to extend the current analysis toward such small scales . @xcite and @xcite showed kinetic power spectra of transverse velocities down to the 0.1  mm scale based on high - resolution imaging data taken with the 1.6  meter nst of bbso , but they did not have magnetic field measurements yet .",
    "one possibility is to use magnetogram data taken with the imaging magnetograph experiment ( imax ) on board the 1  meter sunrise balloon - borne observatory @xcite to extend the power spectra down to the 0.1  mm scale .",
    "argued possible existence of a flux tube population at the spatial scale close to or smaller than the resolution limit of the hinode sp using a deep mode data set .",
    "because the subtraction of the noise spectrum becomes critical to derive the power in the higher wavenumber range , we could not argue the power at the spatial scale below 0.25  mm using the normal mode data in this article .",
    "it is important to use polarimetric data with a higher signal - to - noise ratio for studying the power at the spatial scale as close as the instrumental resolution limit .",
    "the authors would like to thank an anonymous referee for his / her valuable comments and suggestions .",
