    "the singularity theorem  @xcite predicts the existence of singularity in the generic gravitational collapse of a massive star .",
    "however it does not state whether or not the singularity is covered by a horizon .",
    "the naked singularity is considered to be harmful because it spoils the predictability of physics .",
    "hence , penrose  @xcite presented a cosmic censorship hypothesis .",
    "the weak version says that all singularities are hidden in black holes .",
    "the strong version says that no singularity can be seen by any observer .",
    "we call a singularity censored by the weak version a globally naked singularity , and a singularity allowed by the weak version but censored by the strong version a locally naked singularity .",
    "cosmic censorship has not yet been proved .",
    "in fact , we can easily find that some solutions of einstein equation have a naked singularity .",
    "therefore it is important to find out whether those solutions with a naked singularity are _ physically realizable _ or not .",
    "for example , we may consider that some energy condition should be imposed on physical matters",
    ". we should also give regular and generic initial data . in order to have insight into the physical reasonableness",
    ", it will be helpful to understand in what case a naked singularity appears . if a naked singularity is possible in the regime of classical gravity , we might catch a glimpse of planck - scale high - energy physics or quantum gravity .",
    "the spherically symmetric dust collapse is studied by many authors because of the existence of an exact solution .",
    "the collapse of a spherically symmetric and homogeneous dust ball is described by the oppenheimer - snyder solution . in this solution ,",
    "a singularity is neither locally nor globally naked .",
    "therefore any observer can not see the singularity . with this solution ,",
    "the usual picture of a black hole as a final fate of gravitational collapse has been generally accepted . however , once inhomogeneities of the density and velocity distributions are allowed , the above picture does not hold . in this case , the space - time is given by the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution , and it was proved that from very generic initial data the singularity can be either locally or globally naked  @xcite .    the assumption of pressureless matter would not be appropriate for high - density matter .",
    "it is obvious that the effect of pressure on the formation of a naked singularity should be taken into account because the formation of a naked singularity in the ltb solution results in the blow up of the density .",
    "ori and piran  @xcite investigated the collapse of a perfect fluid numerically under the assumption of self - similarity . by this assumption the equation of state of the matter is restricted to the form @xmath2 .",
    "they showed that a naked singularity forms if @xmath3 .",
    "analytic discussions  @xcite based on self - similarity followed it .",
    "an effort of getting rid of the assumption of self - similarity was made by onozawa , siino , and watanabe  @xcite .",
    "they solved numerically the misner - sharp equations  @xcite from regular initial data and searched the formation of an apparent horizon until the density blows up and the numerical scheme breaks down .",
    "in fact , their method is not sufficient to detect naked singularities because the combination of the blow up of the density and the absence of an apparent horizon does not necessarily mean the naked singularity .    in this paper",
    "those difficulties in detection of naked singularities are avoided by constructing the null coordinate .",
    "then , the causal structure of the space - time can be obtained automatically by solving the dynamics of the space - time and matter .",
    "furthermore , by using the `` observer time coordinates , '' the coordinates never cross an event horizon and therefore the global nakedness is trivial .",
    "we should note recent progress on the naked singularity formation in gravitational collapse .",
    "shapiro and teukolsky  @xcite showed numerically that a sufficiently prolate ( even slowly rotating ) spheroid of collisionless gas collapses with the blow up of the curvature invariant without the apparent horizon formation .",
    "the spherical symmetry of the ltb solution has been somewhat relaxed .",
    "it was shown that a central , shell - focusing singularity in nonspherical but quasispherical dust collapse ( i.e. , the szekeres solution  @xcite ) can be either locally or globally naked  @xcite .",
    "recently the stability of the formation of the naked singularity in the ltb solution against nonspherical linear perturbations was investigated numerically , and it was suggested that the cauchy horizon in the ltb solution is stable  @xcite . the restriction to matter has been relaxed to anisotropic pressure  @xcite .",
    "harada , iguchi , and nakao  @xcite showed that the effect of rotation may induce the naked singularity formation by studying the collapse of a spherical cloud of counter - rotating particles .",
    "choptuik  @xcite investigated numerically the spherically symmetric collapse of a scalar field and showed that a zero - mass black hole forms as a critical case for the black hole formation .",

    "we use geometrized units with @xmath4 throughout the paper .",
    "we follow misner , thorne , and wheeler s  @xcite sign conventions of the metric tensor and riemann tensor .",
    "here we concentrate on validity of the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis , i.e. , whether or not a singularity can be globally naked . the singularity is troublesome for numerical relativity because a numerical scheme breaks down at the singularity .",
    "if we choose the spacelike hypersurface as a time slice , we can not know whether or not the singularity is naked because it depends on the further evolution of the space - time . to suggest the nakedness of the singularity ,",
    "many researchers have displayed the absence of an apparent horizon . however",
    "the absence of an apparent horizon does not necessarily mean that the singularity is naked .",
    "in fact , the condition which should be imposed on time slicing in order to guarantee the singularity avoidance is not well known ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to avoid such difficulties , we adopt the time slicing more suited to determine the causal properties of the space - time . for this purpose",
    ", we use the outgoing null coordinate as a time coordinate .",
    "we determine the scaling of this null coordinate in accordance with the proper time of a distant stationary observer .",
    "this outgoing null coordinate @xmath5 is called the `` observer time coordinate ''  @xcite .",
    "this coordinate value corresponds to the time at which a distant observer would see the event .",
    "hence , the observer time coordinates never cross an event horizon .",
    "the limit curve of the time slices @xmath6 in the limit @xmath7 is , if it exists , an event horizon .",
    "therefore , if the observer time coordinates hit a singularity , it turns out to be globally naked .",
    "the procedure to obtain a numerical solution for the space - time is as follows .",
    "first , we prepare initial data on a spacelike hypersurface @xmath8 .",
    "then , we solve the misner - sharp equations  @xcite from the initial data @xmath8 and store data on the first null ray which emanates from the center at @xmath8 .",

    "the conservation of the total mass is a good indicator of numerical errors . in all calculations presented in the next section ,",
    "the total mass was conserved within the accuracy of @xmath10 .",
    "the artificial viscosity term may play a rather subtle role in the formation of a central singularity .",
    "to avoid such additive difficulties , this term was not included basically .",
    "absence of this term did not spoil the results for most calculations because shock wave did not occur for most cases . only for the cases in which the central region expanded , a shock wave occurred , and thereby the calculation suffered from serious numerical instabilities , was the artificial viscosity switched on . for those cases , the fluid did not collapse , and hence the center was regular .",
    "2048 grid zones were prepared in most calculations .    for notational convenience ,",

    "if we take the extremely relativistic limit ( @xmath32 ) , the above equation of state becomes @xmath33 which is the equation of state used by ref .",
    "in determining the final fate of collapse , here we adopt the following criteria .",
    "if the ratio of the rest - mass density of the innermost grid zone to that of the next grid zone excesses 2 , we call it a central ` singularity ' and stop the code . if the lapse function @xmath16 in the hernandez - misner code decreases to less than @xmath34 , we call it an ` event horizon ' .",
    "if a singularity occurs before an event horizon is detected , we call it a ` naked singularity . '",
    "the result is not so sensitive to the choice of the thresholds .",
    "note that the blow up of the rest - mass density inevitably results in the blow up of the scalar @xmath35 .",
    "the scalar curvature @xmath36 also blows up if @xmath37 .    here",
    ", models for three values of @xmath31 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , were calculated . if @xmath41 , then the fluid is relativistic , while , if @xmath42 , then the fluid is not relativistic .",
