    "the 511 kev line arising from electron - positron annihilation is to gamma - ray astronomy what the 21 cm line is to radioastronomy .",
    "the rather young 511 kev gamma astronomy culminates with the recent release of a splendid celestial map of the electron - positron line emission ( kndlseder _ et al . _ 2005@xcite , and references therein ) , on the basis of data collected by the spi spectrometer aboard the integral satellite ( vedrenne _ et al",
    "_ 2003@xcite ) , showing a prominent bulge in the central region of the galaxy .",
    "the interpretation of this map together with the associated energy spectrum around 511 kev is a major challenge of gamma ray astronomy , going beyond , perhaps , pure astrophysics with its host of energetic objects ( millisecond pulsars , low mass x ray binaries , supernovae , hypernovae , gamma ray bursts and so on ) .",
    "since no astrophysical object or class of objects seems to be able to account for this large production rate ( 1.5 10@xmath13 positrons per second emitted in the galactic bulge ) , it is natural to explore more exotic solutions .",
    "it is gratifying to have at our disposal the map of the 2@xmath14 ( the 511 kev thin line ) and 3@xmath14 emissions ( the continuum flanking this line at lower energies ) arising from @xmath15 annihilations through positronium , together with the detailed spectrum around 511 kev   ( kndlseder _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ; jean _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the observed annihilation emission around 511 kev , i.e. a thin ( @xmath16 1.3 kev ) and intense line overlying a broad line ( @xmath16 5 kev ) can be explained by positron annihilations in the warm gas of the galactic bulge , assuming that @xmath17 annihilation is taking place mostly ( more than 93 % ) via positrinonium ( jean _ et al . _ 2005@xcite ; churazov _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) , with a 25% annihilation rate of the positronium into two photons .",
    "most of the photons in this energy range ( with a flux of @xmath18 ph @xmath2 s@xmath3 ) originate in a volume corresponding to the galactic bulge at a copious rate of @xmath19 s@xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , the extension of the emitting region , cocentered to the galaxy , is @xmath20 9 degrees fwhm , assuming a gaussian distribution .",
    "both the high injection rate and the quasi - spherical geometry are difficult , if not impossible , to impute to known astrophysical objects or phenomena .",
    "since the observed 511 kev emission is apparently diffuse ( no evidence for pointlike sources down to @xmath21 ph @xmath2 s@xmath3 ) , there are in principle two general solutions to the problem of feeding the whole bulge with positrons that annihilate within this volume .",
    "one may suppose , either one or a few intense sources of low energy positrons with a large diffusion coefficient of these charged particles in the magnetized medium ; or many sources ( or even a continuum of sources ) associated to a small diffusion coefficient .",
    "the second solution is generally favoured but the situation will remain unsettled until we can estimate safely the diffusion coefficient of low energy electrons and positrons ( @xmath22 mev ) , in a situation for which the quasi - linear diffusion theory ceases to apply since positrons are no longer in resonance with alfven waves ( parizot _ et al . _ 2005@xcite ; jean _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) .",
    "high energy phenomena ( cosmic rays , annihilation of heavy dark matter particles , ... ) are excluded since together with positrons coming from positive pion ( @xmath23 ) decays , gamma rays of relatively high energy ( @xmath24 100 mev or so ) , arising from neutral pion ( @xmath25 ) decays , should show up copiously , which is definitively not the case . indeed on the egret maps , we see no counterpart to the bulge - like emission seen at 511 kev .",
    "this is an important constraint , as we shall see in section [ sec : brems ] since it eliminates , for instance , heavy neutralinos ",
    "the favourite dark matter candidate of particle physicists  as a possible source of these annihilating positrons .",
    "moreover , snia fall short sustaining the high injection rate ( cass _ et al .",
    "_ 2004@xcite ; prantzos 2004@xcite ; schanne _ et al . _",
    ". a snia explosion rate of about 0.5 par century is required to sustain the observed diffuse bulge emission considering that @xmath26 of the positrons produced by radioactivity are trapped in the ejecta , where they annihilate ( milne _ et al . _",
    "1999@xcite ) , whereas a recent estimate based on near infrared calibration ( mannucci _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) as well as on the stellar mass of the old stellar system constituted by the galactic bulge , leads to @xmath27 snia per century ( schanne _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) .",
    "hypernovae and the related gamma ray bursts ( cass _ et al .",
    "_ 2004@xcite ; schanne _ et al .",
    "_ 2004@xcite ; parizot _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) could do better , but since the number of massive stars in the galactic disk ( which are their progenitors ) is about ten times more than in the bulge , hot spots of 511 kev emission in the disk should show up , but this is not the case .    also , according to jean _",
    "( 2005@xcite ) , it is doubtful that low energy positrons from a single source in the central region of the galaxy , including the central black hole , could fill the whole bulge , at least on the basis of their estimate of the positron diffusion coefficient ( admittedly very uncertain ) .",
    "* low mass x - ray binaries have also been suggested ( prantzos 2004@xcite ) , although no quantitative estimate has been made up to now .",
    "the same argument holds for microquasars .",
    "therefore , to say the least , the source of positrons in the bulge is subject to intense debate .",
    "it is thus timely to propose an alternative solution and develop the idea that annihilation of light dark matter particles could be the required positron source ( bo@xmath9ehm _ et al . _  2004b@xcite",
    "; fayet 2004@xcite ; cass _et al . _",
    "2004@xcite ) . indeed independently of integral observations and before the release of its first results light dark matter has been worked out by bo@xmath9ehm & fayet ( 2004@xcite ) , and this special kind of dark matter has shown to be perfectly adapted to explain the essential gamma ray data relative to the bulge of the galaxy : intense @xmath15 annihilation signal without counterpart above 100 mev . since it is light , its annihilation can not give rise to neutral pions and their decay products , high energy photons .",
    "indeed , the emission of 511 kev photons is a two step process .",
    "first low energy positrons are produced by the annihilation of light dark matter ( ldm ) particles , then they propagate in the surrounding medium , they are slowed down principally by ionisation losses , essentially form positronium , practically at rest , and annihilate with electrons in 2 or 3 photons .",
    "once posed the possible existence of ldm particles , it is worth studying the consequences of this hypothesis on different astrophysical phenomena as for instance big bang nucleosynthesis ( serpico & raffelt 2004@xcite ) and the galactic or extragalactic gamma ray background ( beacom _ et al . _ 2005@xcite ; ahn _ et al . _ 2005@xcite ; rasera",
    "_ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) in view of constraining , as much as possible , the properties of the ldm particles . in particular , next to its mass and annihilation cross - section , we would like to learn more about its nature , self - conjugate ( i.e. being its own antiparticle ) or not , bosonic or fermionic",
    ". different versions of ldm particles have been proposed . in any case",
    "the introduction of light dark matter particles  whether spin-0 or spin-@xmath28  has a price and requires the existence of new processes responsible for their annihilations .",
    "these could correspond , in particular , to a new interaction mediated by a new neutral _ light _",
    "spin-1 gauge boson , denoted by @xmath29 , associated with an extension of the standard model gauge group to @xmath30 ( fayet 1981@xcite ; bo@xmath9ehm & fayet 2004@xcite ; fayet 2004@xcite ) .",
    "another important issue concerns the possibility of deriving the dark matter distribution through that of the 511 kev one ( bo@xmath9ehm _ et al . _ 2004b@xcite ; bo@xmath9ehm & ascasibar 2004@xcite ; ascasibar _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) , under the assumption that positrons annihilate close to their region of origin ( on the spot approximation ) , which seems safe for mev energy positrons ( jean _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) , but becomes more doubtful above .",
    "a crucial ingredient in this discussion is the velocity dependence of the annihilation cross - section , also related to the mechanism by which the ldm particle couples to normal fermions .",
    "this could be through the exchange of heavy ( e.g. mirror ) fermions in the case of a spin-0 ldm particle , or through the exchange of a light spin-1 @xmath31 boson ( boehm & fayet 2004@xcite ; fayet 2004@xcite ) .",
    "decomposing this cross - section @xmath32 as a sum , the question is to determine the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which ponder the @xmath35-wave and @xmath36-wave contributions , in the language of particle physicists vanishes if there is no @xmath35-wave contribution to the annihilation cross - section .",
    "then @xmath37 , from the @xmath36-wave contribution . ] .",
    "this is a considerable program , related to the dark matter distribution in the central part of the galaxy , unfortunately very uncertain , and the clumping of dark matter around dense objects , even more uncertain . as a result",
    "we think that it is premature to draw definitive conclusions yet , and that , from this point of view , both @xmath35-wave and @xmath36-wave dark matter annihilations within the milky way ( or possibly a combination of them ) remain possible at this stage ( rasera _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite )  of course with , in general , different dark matter distributions .    a minimal requirement to qualify the light dark matter hypothesis is that it fulfils , at least , the following list of stringent constraints :    * 1 .  * it should amount to about 23% of the present mass density of the universe , to deserve the title of ( non - baryonic ) dark matter .    * 2 .",
    "* it should not jeopardize big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "* its annihilation in the galactic bulge should explain the high positron injection rate in the bulge , as implied by its 511 kev photon emission ( intensity and morphology ) .",
    "* the fast electrons and positrons released by the annihilations of ldm particles in the bulge should note radiate excessively through synchrotron , bremsstrahlung and inverse compton processes  which severely limits their injection energy , and hence the mass of ldm particles .",
    "annihilation of light dark matter particles in the central part of all spheroidal systems ( bulges of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies ) must not lead to an excessively large contribution to the extragalactic soft gamma ray background .",
    "* and , last but not least , the new interaction responsible for the annihilation of ldm particles should be both _ sufficiently strong _ , to ensure for sufficient annihilations of ldm particles ( otherwise one would be led to a much too large contribution to the energy density of the universe ) ; and _ nevertheless discrete enough _ , so that its effects could remain unnoticed up to now .",
    "we focus here mainly on points 1 and 3 , central to our purpose .",
    "point 2 is thoroughly discussed by ( serpico & raffelt 2004@xcite ) .",
    "point 5 is worked out separately ( rasera _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) .",
    "point 4 , still under study , is discussed in section [ sec : brems ] ; already , on the basis of a simple calculation , a mass higher than @xmath10 mev is excluded by considering only the bremsstrahlung emission of fast electrons and positrons in the interstellar medium of the galactic bulge , and comparing it to the bulge emission below @xmath10 mev .",
    "point 6 involves the fact that the amplitudes for the exchange of a @xmath29 boson between ordinary and dark matter particles are _ much larger than weak - interaction amplitudes _ , but only _ at lower energies _  for which weak interactions are really very weak  while becoming smaller at higher energies .",
    "other constraints such as those associated with the possible production of a real spin-1 @xmath31 boson ( that could behave very much like a spin-0 pseudoscalar axion , even if this one may be rendered to some extent `` invisible '' by increasing the extra-@xmath38 symmetry - breaking scale , cf .",
    "( fayet 1980@xcite , 1981@xcite ) ) , or the parity - violation effects it might induce , are discussed in ( fayet 2004@xcite ; bouchiat & fayet 2005@xcite ) .",
    "one of the pressing problems in modern cosmology is the nature of dark matter . understanding it is one of the most important challenges of the century . among many possibilities , wimps , with masses and interaction cross - sections characterised by the weak scale ,",
    "are generally considered as the leading candidates .",
    "however it has been demonstrated that dark matter should not be necessarily heavy ( bo@xmath9ehm _ et al . _ 2004b@xcite ; fayet 2004@xcite ) , provided that its interaction with matter at low energy is significantly stronger than for weak interactions , so as to ensure sufficient annihilations of ldm particles : otherwise one would be led to a much too large contribution to the energy density of the universe .    if this is the case , annihilation of dark matter particles  and the corresponding positron emission as well  is strongly enhanced by the existence of this new channel , as compared to classical weak interactions .",
    "this strengthening of annihilation has beneficial effects on both the relic dm density and the 511 kev emission of the galactic bulge , with some additional requirement on the energy dependence of the cross - section . indeed to avoid overproduction of 511 kev photons in the bulge , the present annihilation cross - section ( @xmath32 )",
    "should be typically about four orders of magnitude lower than at the period of freeze out of such ldm particles , in the early universe .",
    "this implies ( as considered on the basis of a different argumentation by bo@xmath9ehm _",
    "( 2004a ) ) that the cross - section must be velocity dependent , the velocity of dm particles being about @xmath39 at freeze out time , and @xmath40 in the bulge , at the present epoch .",
    "this is indeed the case if the new interaction is mediated by a new neutral gauge boson , noted @xmath31 , rather light , and very weakly coupled ( at least to ordinary matter ) .",
    "an interesting constraint on the mass of the ldm particle can be set from the bremsstrahlung emission of electrons and positrons released in the bulge by the annihilation of ldm particles .",
    "actually , given the large rate of positrons produced , smaller dark matter masses tend to be favored , to avoid an excessive production of such gamma rays ( fayet 2004@xcite ; cass _ et al . _",
    "2004@xcite ) .",
    "the inner bremsstrahlung emission of gamma rays ( accompanying the electrons and positrons produced during dark matter radiative annihilation processes ) , in particular , forbids the larger values of the ldm mass , restricting it to less than @xmath41 mev@xmath42 ( beacom _ et al . _",
    "2005@xcite ) , or possibly more , depending on the exact evaluation of the radiative annihilation cross - section .",
    "independently of this process , at the energies of interest to us , below 100 mev , the energy losses in the course of the propagation of the emitted electrons and positrons are dominated by ionisation ( which ultimately results in heating the medium ) .",
    "the power injected in the ism by these non - thermal leptons is totally negligible compared to that of stars under the form of photons ( i.e. about 4 10@xmath13 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "while bremsstrahlung losses is a small fraction ( decreasing at low energy ) of the energy spent in ionising and heating the ambient gas , this emission , in the soft gamma ray regime , is indeed quite significant , as far as we are concerned here .",
    "let s suppose , for the simplicity of the argument , that the mass of the ldm particle is @xmath10 mev@xmath42 .",
    "the annihilation of two of them releases an @xmath11 and an @xmath12 of @xmath43 mev each .",
    "the positron should loose practically all its kinetic energy ( about 100 mev @xmath44 erg ) to form positronium , almost at rest , before annihilating .",
    "it then leaves this kinetic energy to the ambient medium , and so does the associated electron .",
    "the whole population of emitted positrons ( 1.5 10@xmath13 s@xmath3 ) , and associated electrons , should then leave a very large energy deposit of about 5 10@xmath45 erg s@xmath46 altogether in the bulge volume ( or about 5 10@xmath47 erg s@xmath46 , in the case of a 10 mev@xmath42 particle ) .",
    "the relative fraction of energy lost by bremsstrahlung in the medium as compared to ionisation is density - independent , since both depend linearly on the gas ( hydrogen ) density of the medium traversed by the fast electrons and positrons , but very energy - dependent .",
    "this ratio bremsstrahlung / ionisation amounts to about @xmath48 at 100 mev ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 in fatuzzio & melia ( 2003@xcite ) )  but not much more than at 10 mev . concentrating on the higher energies ,",
    "the resulting bremsstrahlung emission is already much more than what could be allowed from the observations : i.e. , less than 10@xmath49 erg s@xmath3 in the 30 - 100 mev energy band according to egret data , since there no hint of a bulge in the longitude and latitude profile of the 30 - 100 mev gamma emission ( hunter _ et al . _",
    "1997@xcite ) .",
    "this kind of argument , worked out more precisely ( in progress ) and applied to the gamma ray continuum measured at lower energies by the comptel and ibis - integral missions , in the direction of the central region of the milky way , limits the mass of the ldm particle and constrains it to be significantly below 100 mev .",
    "the resulting limit is in fact potentially stronger than what may be obtained from the inner bremsstrahlung , as the rate of energy loss by usual bremsstrahlung in the medium is @xmath50 at 20 mev , to be compared , in the case of the inner bremstrahlung , with a radiative correction effect proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , in the favored case of a @xmath36-wave ( or at least largely @xmath36-wave dominated at freeze out ) annihilation cross - section , which is much smaller in the milky way than at the time of freeze out , the intensity of the observed positron annihilation line also favors lower values of the ldm mass . indeed , for a given dark matter",
    "mass distribution , the number density of dark matter particles ( @xmath52 )  i.e. ultimately the number of positrons produced  is inversely proportional to the ldm mass .",
    "having too heavy ldm particles , and therefore fewer of them , would then also necessitate postulating a rather large clumping factor for dark matter particles , to provide for the required annihilation flux of positrons .",
    "type ia supernovae do not seem to inject enough positrons in the bulge ism to explain the spi - integral observations .",
    "but , maybe , the snia rate is totally abnormal there for unknown reasons ? or the galactic bulge does not behaves like a normal spheroidal system populated with old stars , as believed up to now ? if not , since compact objects seem to be unable to inject _ low energy _ positrons at a sufficient rate , one may have to accept the fact that something apparently rather exotic is happening in the middle of the galaxy .    in this context",
    ", the usual hypothesis of heavy neutralinos ( implied by supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , with @xmath53-parity conservation ) is discarded as the source of such positrons , as it would also overproduce gamma rays in the 100 mev - few gev range swept by egret .",
    "while light dark matter annihilation is not the only candidate , it deserves special consideration since it could explain , at the same time , the dark matter relic density and the @xmath15 annihilation radiation in the central region of the galaxy ; and at the moment , no physical or astrophysical test appears to contradict it .",
    "laboratory research is thus essential to discover it .",
    "we thank y. rasera , j. paul , s. schanne and our colleagues in saclay for interesting discussions ."
