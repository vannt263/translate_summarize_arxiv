    "in this article , we introduce two new series of nonperiodic substitution tilings in the plane , where the tiles appear in infinitely many different orientations .",

    "the standard example is certainly the pinwheel tiling of conway and radin @xcite , and most work about tilings with tiles in infinitely many orientations is dedicated to this special example .",
    "it stimulated several re - formulations of concepts which play a role in the theory of nonperiodic tilings .",
    "for instance , it suggests to define the dynamical system of such a tiling @xmath0 as the closure ( in an appropriate topology ) of the orbit of @xmath0 under the action of the euclidean group @xmath1 of @xmath2 , rather than the translation group @xmath2 alone .",
    "further examples of tilings showing tiles in infinitely many orientations are rarely found in the literature .",
    "sadun gave a generalization of the pinwheel tiling @xcite , yielding a countable number of different substitution tilings with this property .",
    "apart from this , there are only few examples known to the author .",
    "one is folklore , but nevertheless not widely known .",
    "it is shown in figure [ pw9 ] .",
    "two more were found by harriss @xcite .",
    "the tilings introduced in sections [ sec : pyth ] and [ sec : tipi ] of the present article show that the occurrence of infinitely many orientations in substitution tilings is not necessarily a rare effect .",
    "these tilings include examples of finite local complexity as well as infinite local complexity ( w.r.t.euclidean motions ) , with an arbitrary number of prototiles , and with or without primitive substitution matrices . some of the occurring substitution factors are pisot - vijayaraghavan numbers ( including the smallest one ) , others are not .",
    "section [ sec : tilings ] states some basic definitions and facts about substitution tilings . in section [ sec : scs ] , we define statistical circular symmetry of a substitution tiling and prove a technical result which turns out to be useful in the sequel .",
    "section [ sec : properties ] is dedicated to prove that many properties of the pinwheel tiling generalise to the whole class of substitution tilings with tiles in infinitely many orientations . in particular , these properties are uniform distribution of orientations , uniform patch frequencies ( w.r.t . to the topology used in @xcite as well as the local rubber topology in @xcite ) , circular symmetry of the autocorrelation , and therefore of the diffraction spectrum @xcite .",

    "throughout the text , we will identify the euclidean plane with the complex plane , choosing freely the point of view which fits better to the question at hand .",

    "a tiling @xmath0 is _ nonperiodic _ if @xmath9 implies @xmath10 .",
    "tile substitutions are a simple and powerful tool to generate interesting nonperiodic tilings .",

    "therefore , one needs to specify how to arrange the tiles @xmath46 in a sequence @xmath47 .",

    "the associated angles ) are ordered in a natural way . with respect to the limit , for instance , it is equivalent to ordering tiles according to their distance from the origin in an increasing order .",
    "this fact follows from standard properties of primitive substitution tilings .",
    "since the pinwheel tilings are not only pinwheel - like , but also of statistical circular symmetry , one may argue that the term pinwheel - like is not well chosen .",
    "however , theorem [ unifdistr ] below shows the equivalence of pinwheel - likeness and statistical circular symmetry for primitive substitution tilings , so the term pinwheel - like becomes obsolete .",

    "the prototile @xmath60 is mirror - symmetric along its vertical axis .",
    "therefore , we equip it with a mark in order to illustrate the absence of reflections in the substitution rule . the substituted triangle @xmath61 contains four copies of @xmath60 in the same orientation as @xmath60 , and two copies of @xmath60 which are rotated by @xmath62 .",

    "the tilings in this example are pinwheel - like .    during the last years",

    "the rotation part @xmath7 is usually omitted .",

    "there is @xmath264 such that a copy of @xmath260 is contained in all supertiles @xmath265 , @xmath266 .",
    "let @xmath267 be some prototile . by the proof of proposition [ thetanotinpq ] ,",
    "there is @xmath268 such that holds : for all @xmath269 there is @xmath270 such that each supertile @xmath271 contains a translate of @xmath272 for all @xmath273 .",
    "every angle @xmath274 can be approximated by @xmath275 ( with suitable @xmath88 ) arbitrarily close .",
    "let us combine these observations .",
    "there is a particular supertile @xmath276 containing translates of @xmath272 for all @xmath273 .",
    "thus , there is @xmath277 such that all supertiles @xmath278 contain translates of @xmath272 for all @xmath273 .",
    "then , all supertiles @xmath279 contain copies of @xmath260 , in angles @xmath280 .",
    "the orientation of @xmath260 can be approximated arbitrarily close by increasing @xmath102 .",
    "thus , there are @xmath281 such that each supertile @xmath279 contains a copy @xmath282 of @xmath260 , with @xmath283 , @xmath18 , @xmath262 . for this particular choice @xmath281",
    ", there is @xmath284 such that each supertile @xmath279 fits into a ball with radius @xmath285 .",
    "thus each ball of radius @xmath286 contains an entire supertile , which proves the claim .",
    "the circular symmetry of @xmath34 implies the circular symmetry of the autocorrelation ( compare for instance @xcite , @xcite ) of its elements , and therefore the circular symmetry of its diffraction spectrum .",
    "this has been known for the pinwheel tilings .",
    "the results in this article imply the circular symmetry of the diffraction of all primitive substitution tilings with tiles in infinitely many orientations .",
    "the relevance of theorem [ upf ] relies on the connection to dynamical systems of a tiling space . in the case of finitely many orientations ( that is , the number of @xmath29 as in is finite ) , the dynamical system @xmath287 is uniquely ergodic , if and only if the tilings in @xmath34 have uniform patch frequency @xcite",
    "this result plays a central role for further investigations of such systems .",
    "the generalization of this result to tilings with statistical circular symmetry will be worth investigating in the future .",

    "( flc ) , if for each @xmath288 , the number of congruence classes of @xmath289 ( @xmath290 ) is finite .",
    "the pythia and the tipi substitution tilings introduced here show both cases : flc and non - flc .",
    "this can be shown by the methods in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that , in the case of finitely many orientations , flc is frequently defined by for each @xmath288 , the number of _ translation _ classes of @xmath289 ( @xmath290 ) is finite. in the present context we deviate from this convention for obvious reasons .",
    "the substitution factor of a self - similar substitution determines already many properties of the corresponding tilings .",
    "for instance , if the substitution factor is a pv number , then the tiling is flc under a certain ( mild ) condition @xcite .",
    "pv number stands for pisot - vijayaraghavan number , an algebraic integer which algebraic conjugates are all smaller than one in modulus .",
    "the substitution factors of the tilings in this article cover various cases .",

    ", one needs to alter the setting slightly : the case @xmath294 does not obey the requirement gcd@xmath295 .",
    "therefore , the pythagoras substitution for these values is not longer primitive : there are four prototiles @xmath296 , but in each pythagoras tiling to @xmath297 , only two of them occur , either @xmath298 , or @xmath299 .",
    "the substitution @xmath300 does the job : it uses only two prototiles @xmath301 .",
    "the substitution factor is the golden mean @xmath302 .",
    "the corresponding pythia tiling ( see golden pinwheel tilings in @xcite ) has substitution factor @xmath303 , which is a quadratic pv number .",
    "other pv numbers occurring as substitution factors for pythagoras tilings are the dominant roots of @xmath304 ( which is the smallest pv number among all algebraic integers @xcite ) , of @xmath305 and of @xmath306 .",
    "thus , pv numbers which are substitution factors of the pythia tilings include powers of those .",
    "pv numbers occurring as substitution factors for tipi tilings include the ones mentioned for the pythagoras tilings , as well as the dominant root of @xmath307 ( in the case @xmath308 ) .",
