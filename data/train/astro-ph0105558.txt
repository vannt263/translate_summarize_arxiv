    "in spite of many attempts , the evolution of @xmath0li  in the galaxy is not completely understood .",
    "lithium has the unique property of being produced by , at least , three different processes : big bang nucleosynthesis , spallation of galactic cosmic - ray ( gcr ) particles on interstellar matter ( ism ) nuclei , and stellar nucleosynthesis . at the same time , @xmath0li  is easily destroyed by proton captures in stellar interiors at relatively low temperatures ( @xmath1  k ) .",

    "ii ) dwarf stars is surprisingly uniform : @xmath0li / h @xmath3 ( spite & spite  1982 ) , a value @xmath4 times lower than the maximum abundance observed in pop .",
    "several studies have subsequently confirmed the existence of the so - called `` spite plateau '' in pop .",
    "ii stars , although discrepancies on the actual value of the plateau still exist at the level of @xmath5  dex ( see e.g. , spite & spite 1986 ; hobbs & duncan 1987 ; rebolo , beckman , & molaro  1988 ; thorburn  1994 ; spite et al . 1996 ; bonifacio & molaro 1997 ) .",

    "the spite plateau corresponds to @xmath7  @xmath8 . ]",
    "there is an ongoing debate about whether the spite plateau corresponds to the ( almost ) undepleted primordial abundance of @xmath0li  , or whether the primordial value is closer to @xmath7  @xmath93.3 ( the value measured in the youngest stars and solar system meteorites ) and has been significantly but uniformly depleted in pop .",
    "ii stars ( see e.g. deliyannis & ryan 1997 ; bonifacio & molaro 1997 ) .",
    "on one hand , the former interpretation requires processes that increase the galactic @xmath0li  abundance by a factor @xmath4 in the first few gyr . on the other hand _ standard models _ of stellar evolution which incorporate",
    "only convective mixing predict little ( @xmath5  dex ) @xmath0li  depletion in pop .",
    "ii stars ( e.g. , deliyannis , demarque & kawaler 1990 ) .",
    "stellar models including the effects of non - standard processes ( like e.g. diffusion , winds , turbulence induced by rotational instabilities , slow mixing driven by angular momentum loss , etc . ) predict substantial @xmath0li  destruction in pop .",
    "ii stars ( see pinsonneault  1997 for a review ) .",
    "these non - standard models predict observable features , like a dispersion in @xmath0li  among halo dwarfs , or correlations between @xmath0li  and t@xmath10 or [ fe / h ] , which have not been confirmed by observations , suggesting that @xmath0li  destruction must have been minimal in these stars ( see e.g. , boesgaard & steigman  1985 , bonifacio & molaro  1997 , ryan , norris , & beers  1999 , ryan et al .",
    "it is true , however , that the presence of a few metal  poor stars with @xmath0li  abundances somewhat above the plateau , as well as other observational evidences in pop .",
    "i stars ( deliyannis et al .  1998 , deliyannis 2000 ) support the idea that halo dwarfs may have suffered a certain amount of @xmath0li  depletion",
    ".    indication of a primordial abundance of @xmath0li  in excess of the spite plateau value is suggested also by ( _ i _ ) recent determinations of deuterium abundances in lyman-@xmath11 clouds ( see e.g. pettini & bowen  2001 and references therein ) , and ( _ ii _ ) observations of the spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation ( de bernardis et .",
    "al .  2000 , tegmark & zaldarriaga  2000 ) .",
    "in both cases the value of the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath12 results in the range 67 , rather than 45 as usually assumed . this implies a cosmological abundance of @xmath0li  in excess of the spite plateau value by a factor 23 , still compatible with the observationally allowed range of primordial @xmath13he .",
    "however , one should be very careful in interpreting these indications since possible sources of systematic errors have still to be completely understood and eliminated from the observational data .",
    "the issue remains therefore open .    assuming that the spite plateau corresponds to the primordial @xmath0li  abundance , the difference between the plateau abundance and the maximum @xmath0li  content in pop .",
    "i stars underscores the need for one or more sites of @xmath0li  production .",
    "it is well known that @xmath14be , @xmath15b , and @xmath16li can be produced via spallation and fusion reactions between gcr particles and ism nuclei ( fowler , reeves , & silk  1970 ; meneguzzi , audouze & reeves  1971 ) .",
    "whereas theoretical calculations of the amounts of @xmath14be , @xmath15b and @xmath17li produced by gcr ( see e.g. lemoine , vangioni - flam , & cass  1998 ; fields & olive  1999 ; ramaty et al .  2000 , and references therein ) can roughly reproduce the observed values , the amount of @xmath0li  produced by spallation processes at the time of formation of the sun is a factor 510 lower than the measured meteoritic value ( see also nissen et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) [ fe / h ] @xmath18 , the predictions of gcr spallation models indicate a possible overproduction of @xmath16li due to @xmath11-@xmath11 reactions ( prantzos et al .",
    "1993 , valle et al .",
    "2001 in preparation ) that may suggest the occurence of a depletion process in halo stars at least in this metallicity range . ] .",
    "additional sites of @xmath0li  production are therefore required to match the observational data .",
    "for example , dantona & matteucci  ( 1991 ) proposed that novae and agb stars may represent the main sources of galactic @xmath0li  , whereas matteucci , dantona , & timmes  ( 1995 ) favoured a model where the main contributors to @xmath0li  enrichment are snii and agb stars .",
    "abia , isern , & canal  ( 1995 ) considered the production of @xmath0li  by low - mass agb stars , whereas romano et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that novae are required in order to reproduce the growth of @xmath0li  with metallicity , and that the contribution from snii should be lowered by at least a factor of two .",
    "finally , romano et al .  ( 2001 ) , using recent agb models by ventura , dantona , & mazzitelli  ( 2000 ) , concluded that agb stars are not substantial @xmath0li  producers in the galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we reanalyze the problem afresh with the help of a numerical model of galactic chemical evolution and a set of new models of agb stars of various masses and metallicities .",
    "we consider various stellar sources of @xmath0li  : novae , type ii supernovae , low and intermediate  mass stars in the red giant branch ( rgb ) and agb phase .",
    "all these sources can produce @xmath0li  , as shown by theoretical models , and , in some cases , also confirmed by spectroscopic data .",
    "however , individual @xmath0li  yields are rather uncertain and strongly dependent on model parameters and assumptions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   2",
    "we discuss our sample of observational data for field stars and open clusters . in ",
    "3 we briefly describe the adopted model for galactic chemical evolution . in the following sections we then focus on the analysis of the @xmath0li  production by different stellar sources . in particular in ",
    "4 we consider the role of intermediate - mass agb stars ( hereafter ims - agb ) , presenting new @xmath0li yields obtained from the agb models by frost  ( 1997 ) .",
    "we reanalyze the production of @xmath0li  by novae (   5 ) , snii (   6 ) , and low - mass rgb stars (   7 ) , on the basis of recent model calculations and observations . finally , in   8 we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "the main source of our compilation is the recent study by fulbright  ( 2000 ) who determined @xmath0li  , fe , and other element abundances for 168 halo and disk stars .",
    "both stellar parameters and abundances of @xmath0li  and fe were inferred by carrying out a self - consistent lte analysis , providing a homogeneous sample of both pop .",
    "ii and pop .",
    "the survey of fulbright does not extend to very low or very high metallicities ; therefore we complemented it for [ fe / h ] @xmath19 with the compilation of bonifacio & molaro  ( 1997 ) . at [ fe / h ] @xmath20 we included a sample of warm ( @xmath21  k ) , unevolved f - type stars taken from balachandran  ( 1990 ) and lambert , health , & edvardsson  ( 1991 ) .",
    "we note that , whereas cooler stars have certainly undergone li depletion ( unless very young ) , considering only stars warmer than 5700  k allows having a subsample of minimally depleted stars which trace the upper envelope of the @xmath0li  vs. [ fe / h ] distribution .",

    "( 1996 ) , ryan et al .",
    "different datasets and/or analysis methods ( in particular the use of different effective temperature calibrations ) lead in general to a different abundance scale : therefore , including @xmath0li  abundances from many different sources in the same compilation may introduce a spurious ( i.e. not real ) dispersion in the @xmath0li  vs [ fe / h ] distribution . for this reason , we decided to base our compilation of @xmath0li  abundances for pop .",
    "ii stars on the minimum number of studies allowing the full coverage of the entire metallicity range .",
    "we mention that fulbright  ( 2000 ) derived an average offset between his and bonifacio & molaro s ( 1997 ) effective temperatures @xmath22  k , which should not introduce major systematic differences in the inferred @xmath0li  abundances .",
    "there are several stars in common between the two studies : for all of them the agreement in @xmath0li  abundances is indeed very good ( within @xmath5  dex ) .",
    "we did not include in our list stars evolved off the main sequence ( hereafter ms ) and/or stars cooler than 5700  k ; both groups of stars most likely did not preserve their original @xmath0li  content due to either post - ms dilution or to ms @xmath0li  depletion and thus are not adequate to trace the upper envelope of the @xmath0li  vs. metallicity distribution .",
    "we also did not include @xmath0li  abundances for t tauri stars , since they may be affected by several problems such as spectral veiling , nlte , or , more generally , by the effects of a  disturbed stellar photosphere \" ( see e.g. duncan  1991 ) .",
    "instead , we included in our compilation the average abundance of warm ( i.e. f  type ) stars in young open clusters with @xmath23[fe / h]@xmath24 .",
    "these stars have undergone minimal pre - ms or ms @xmath0li  depletion and thus their abundance can be considered as representative of the present ism @xmath0li  content .",
    "several surveys of @xmath0li  among open cluster stars ( see e.g. jeffries  2000 for a recent review ) have shown that li - undepleted stars in all the investigated clusters share the same abundance @xmath25 ( e.g. , randich et al .",

    "we plot the @xmath0li  abundance vs. metallicity for the stars of our sample .",
    "a few features in this figure warrant detailed comments . as far as the @xmath0li",
    "plateau is concerned , recent studies have inferred slightly different values for the plateau value , due  as mentioned above  to different types of analysis and , in particular , to possible offsets in the zero - point of the effective temperature scale ( see e.g. , spite et al .",
    "in our model of galactic evolution we have generally adopted as initial @xmath0li  abundance the value determined by bonifacio & molaro ( 1997 ) for the spite plateau , i.e. @xmath28 , under the implicit assumption that the spite plateau represents the primordial ( big - bang ) abundance .",
    "we mention in passing that the mean abundance of the stars in the compilation of fulbright  ( 2000 ) with [ fe / h]@xmath29 is @xmath30 in excellent agreement with the estimate of bonifacio & molaro  ( 1997 ) .",
    "we also ran our model starting with an initial @xmath0li  abundance higher by a factor 2 than the spite plateau value ( see below ) , following the idea that pop .",
    "ii stars may have depleted a certain amount of li in the course of their evolution .",
    "figure  1 also suggests that the rise of @xmath0li  abundance from the spite plateau may be smoother than claimed in previous studies .",
    "in particular , a few stars are present in the survey of fulbright  ( 2000 ) which have intermediate metallicities ( @xmath31 [ fe / h ] @xmath32 ) and @xmath0li  abundances 0.20.3 dex ( i.e. @xmath33 ) above the plateau but not as high as @xmath34 . however , the caveat is that only a few stars define the upper envelope at intermediate metallicity and we can not exclude that these stars have suffered some li depletion .    a sharp increase to abundances as high as the present ism abundance may occur at metallicities between [ fe / h]@xmath35 and @xmath36 , if the abundances for the few stars which trace the upper envelope of the distribution at those metallicities are correct .",
    "these stars are from the survey of balachandran ( 1990 ) , but we mention that li abundances derived by balachandran are systematically higher than those of boesgaard & tripicco ( 1986 ) , with differences in the range 0.2  0.6 dex . for the case of hr 8315 ( hd 206901 ) lbre et al .",
    "( 1999 ) inferred a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath37 and a @xmath0li  abundance @xmath38 to be compared with [ fe / h]@xmath39 and @xmath40 determined by balachandran  ( 1990 ) .",
    "we also notice that photometric iron abundances for some of the intermediate metallicity and li - rich stars observed by balachandran ( 1990 ) are at least 0.2 dex higher than the spectroscopic values inferred by balachandran ( see the last two columns of table  1 in balachandran  1990 ) , suggesting again that @xmath0li  abundance @xmath41 is reached only at higher metallicities ( i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath42 ) .",
    "determinations of @xmath0li abundances in this critical metallicity range are certainly needed in order to better constrain the @xmath0li  vs. [ fe / h ] upper envelope .      in the lower panel of figure  1",
    "we show the abundance of @xmath0li  vs. galactic age using @xmath0li  data for stars in galactic open and globular clusters .",

    "the average abundance measured in warm ( @xmath51  k ) , undepleted cluster ms stars , is plotted in the figure .",

    "( 1997 ) for ic  2602 ; randich et al .",

    "( 1993 ) for the pleiades ; thorburn et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for the hyades . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial abundance for older clusters was estimated from stars at ( or just evolved off ) the turn - off in the 2  gyr clusters ngc  752 ( hobbs & pilachowski  1986 ) , ngc  3680 ( randich , pasquini , & pallavicini  2000 ) and from the abundances of the two components of the tidally locked binary s1045 in the solar - aged m  67 cluster ( deliyannis et al .",
    "1994 ; pasquini , randich , & pallavicini  1997 ) .",
    "finally , globular clusters ( gcs ) are represented by a box that shows the ranges in @xmath0li  and age estimates .",
    "more specifically , gcs absolute ages are the subject of a long standing debate ; in the lower panel of figure  1 we used the recent determination by carretta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who inferred an average age of @xmath52  gyr based on _ hipparcos _ parallaxes for local subdwarfs .",
    "we mention , however , that ages as large as 1617 gyr can not be ruled out .",
    "abundances of @xmath0li  were derived for unevolved stars at the turn - off in three clusters only , namely , ngc  6397 ( pasquini & molaro  1996 ) , 47 tuc ( pasquini & molaro  1997 ) , and m  92 ( boesgaard et al .",
    "1998 ) ; whereas the average abundances for the three clusters are close to the value of the spite plateau , stars in the same cluster show a significant dispersion in @xmath0li  ( see discussion in boesgaard et al .  1998 ) and , in particular , a star is found in m  92 with a @xmath0li  content significantly higher than the plateau and the other cluster stars .",
    "consequently , we think that the use of a box is more appropriate to indicate the position of gcs in figure  1 .",
    "the model of galactic chemical evolution adopted in this work is described in detail by ferrini & galli ( 1988 ) , galli & ferrini ( 1989 ) and ferrini et al .",
    "the same model was adopted by galli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , travaglio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and travaglio et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , to study the evolution of the light elements d and @xmath53he , and the evolution of the heavy elements from ba to pb , respectively .",
    "we briefly recall here the basic features of the model .",
    "the galaxy is divided into three zones , halo , thick disk , and thin disk , whose composition of stars , gas ( atomic and molecular ) and stellar remnants is computed as functions of time up to the present epoch @xmath54  gyr .",
    "the thin disk is formed from material infalling from the thick disk and the halo .",
    "the formation of the sun in the thin disk takes place 4.5  gyr ago , i.e. at epoch @xmath55  gyr . the star formation rate in the three zones is not assumed _ a priori _ , but is obtained as the result of self - regulating processes occurring in the molecular gas phase , either spontaneously or stimulated by the presence of other stars .    in models of galactic chemical evolution",
    "it is customary to separate the contribution of stars in different mass ranges to the enrichment of the ism .",
    "our model follows the evolution of ( _ i _ ) single low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath56 ) ending their life as he or c - o white dwarf , ( _ ii _ ) binary systems able to produce type i supernovae , and ( _ iii _ ) single massive stars ( @xmath57 ) , the progenitors of type ii supernovae .",
    "the value of @xmath58 depends on metallicity ; we assume @xmath59  @xmath60 for [ fe / h]@xmath61 , and @xmath62  @xmath60 otherwise ( see for references tornamb & chieffi  1986 ) . the adopted initial mass function ( hereafter imf )",
    "is discussed in ferrini et al .",
    "stellar nucleosynthesis is treated according to the matrix formalism introduced by talbot & arnett ( 1973 ) .",
    "specific yields are taken from calculations by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) and thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto ( 1996 ) , for type ii and type i supernovae , respectively .",
    "hot bottom burning ( hereafter hbb ) occurs in intermediate mass agb stars when the bottom of the convective envelope of the star reaches the top layers of the hydrogen burning shell .",
    "sackmann & boothroyd  ( 1992 ) showed that the cameron - fowler mechanism ( cameron  1955 ; cameron & fowler  1971 ) is very effective at producing @xmath0li  , and can quantitatively account for the @xmath0li  abundance measured by smith & lambert ( 1990 ) in the super - li rich agb stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "we present here a summary of results for @xmath0li  production in agb stars of various masses and metallicities , based on the evolutionary models of frost  ( 1997 ) and synthetic models using the technique of forestini & charbonnel  ( 1997 ) .",
    "we then discuss the sensitivity of @xmath0li  enrichment to the mass - loss prescriptions during the latest phases of agb evolution .",
    "frost  ( 1997 ) computed the evolution of 4 , 5 , and 6 @xmath60  models each with metal content @xmath64 , 0.008 , and 0.004 , appropriate to the solar neighborhood , and to the large and small magellanic clouds , spanning the evolution from the ms through the end of the agb phase .",
    "each case has been the subject of a detailed nucleosynthesis study using a modified post - processing code ( cannon  1993 ) including 74 species and over 500 reactions .",
    "some of the results of these models have been already published ( e.g. frost et al .",
    "1998 , lattanzio & forestini  1999 ) ; in this paper we present in detail an analysis of the production of @xmath0li .",
    "our present approach is to use the stellar models of frost  ( 1997 ) as the basis of synthetic models computed with the code of forestini & charbonnel  ( 1997 ) . in this way we force the synthetic code to follow the results of the stellar models (",
    "accuracy is within 10% ) , yet we are free to vary those parameters which have no significant feedback on the evolution . in particular , for the aim of this paper , we investigated the mass - loss rate at the end of the agb phase ( see next section for detailed discussion ) .",
    "we do not expect modest changes in the mass - loss rate during the latest agb phase to have a significant effect on the structural evolution of the star , since the variations in the mass - loss rate only affect the very late phases of stellar evolution .",
    "nevertheless , we caution against placing too much belief in the quantitative results for the extreme cases discussed below .",
    "the surface @xmath0li  abundances during the agb lifetime in the stellar envelope for the nine models considered here is presented in figure  2 .",
    "note that the abundance of @xmath0li  at the beginning of the agb phase varies from one model to another as a result of previous evolution .",
    "2 is a @xmath65 grid figure with mass increasing along the @xmath66-axis and @xmath67 decreasing along the @xmath68-axis : in this way we expect hbb to increase for increasing @xmath66-axis ( mass ) or increasing @xmath68-axis ( decreasing @xmath67 ) .",
    "the most extreme hbb is for the top right plot , i.e. @xmath69  @xmath60  model with @xmath70 , where the maximum @xmath0li  production lasts for the longest time ( @xmath71  yr ) .",
    "the maximum @xmath0li  abundances we obtain range around @xmath7  @xmath72 , independent of stellar mass and metallicity , and only depending on the occurrence of hbb . the models with @xmath73  @xmath60  and @xmath64",
    ", 0.008 show no hbb and consequently no @xmath0li  production .",
    "in fact , @xmath0li  destruction in these two models proves that their convective bottom temperatures are high enough to burn @xmath0li  through @xmath0li@xmath74he channel , but not enough to produce @xmath0be ( that decays to @xmath0li , cameron - fowler mechanism ) by @xmath53he burning .",
    "conversely the 6 @xmath60  models , with their substantial envelopes , begin hbb immediately on the agb and hence they produce a large amount of @xmath0li  , but the high envelope temperature also assists in the destruction of @xmath0li  . finally , figure  2 shows that in all models , as the evolution of the star proceeds , the surface @xmath0li  abundance decreases again more or less rapidly , depending on the mass and metallicity .",
    "this indicates that the initial reserves of @xmath53he have been consumed in the production of @xmath0li  , and this @xmath0li  is now itself being destroyed ( without replenishment ) by proton captures .",
    "there are observational indications that some galactic c - stars ( stars with c / o @xmath75 ) are also super - li rich stars ( @xmath7  @xmath76 , see e.g. abia et al .  1991 , abia , pavlenko , & de laverny  1999 , abia & isern  2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we also examined the @xmath0li  vs. c / o trends for the nine cases presented above .",
    "the models of frost  ( 1997 ) use the algorithm for the third dredge - up ( i.e. the penetration of the convective envelope into the partially he - burnt zone after each thermal pulse ) , as described by frost & lattanzio  ( 1996 ) , and include the entropy adjustment by wood  ( 1981 ) . after each third dredge - up episode",
    "the @xmath77c abundance is increased .",
    "hence third dredge - up increases the ratio c / o ( by adding c to the stellar envelope ) , and hbb ( where it is active ) decreases it again as it transforms c into n. figure  3 shows the c / o ratio vs. @xmath0li  for the nine models under consideration . in some cases hbb prevents the formation of a c star , while in other cases it merely delays the formation to a time when hbb has stopped and third dredge - up continues ( see frost et al .",
    "1998 for more details ) .",
    "the condition c / o @xmath75 together with high @xmath0li  values are obtained only for the case @xmath78 0.004 and @xmath79 4 @xmath60  and for a very short phase for the case with the same metallicities and @xmath79 5 @xmath60 . in particular ,",
    "the 4 @xmath60  model is a li - rich star ( with @xmath7  @xmath80 4 ) and c - rich star for a period of about 10@xmath81 yr .",
    "moreover , all the other cases show high @xmath0li  abundances together with o - rich envelopes , in agreement with observations of agb stars in the magellanic clouds ( see e.g. smith et al .",
    "1995 ) and in the galaxy ( see e.g. the recent work from arellano ferro , giridhar , & mathias  2001 ) .",
    "the range of @xmath82 covered by the nine models presented here ( @xmath83 ) during the li - rich phase is in agreement with bolometric magnitudes of the super - li rich stars observed in the magellanic clouds ( smith et al .",

    "( 1991 ) : iyhya ( @xmath91 and @xmath7  @xmath92 ) , and tsgr ( @xmath93 and @xmath7  @xmath94 ) .",
    "given the uncertainties , and excluding the not reliable measurement of @xmath82 for wzcas by abia & isern  ( 2000 ) , we conclude that the @xmath82 determinations for the galactic super - li rich stars are still consistent with the @xmath95 reached by our agb models during the super - li rich phase .",
    "we also notice that the highest abundance reached by our models for @xmath7  is @xmath96 , while higher values are inferred from observations .",
    "there are observational indications that toward the end of their evolution , agb stars ( both of low- and intermediate - mass ) can experience a short phase of extremely rapid mass - loss , called _ superwind _ ( van der veen , habing , & geballe  1989 ; schrder , winters , & sedlmayr  1999 ) . in this phase periods of heavy mass - loss",
    "may be interspersed with much longer periods of lower mass - loss rates , possibly powered by he shell flashes .",
    "these stars are often surrounded by a dense circumstellar envelope and some of them are no longer visible at optical wavelengths .",
    "evidence for a superwind has been found in co observations of c stars ( e.g. olofsson  1993 ) , of k giants ( de la reza et al .",
    "1997 ; castilho et al .",
    "1998 ) , and in post - agb objects that show concentric rings around the central object ( see e.g. crabtree & rogers  1993 ; latter et al .  1993 ;",
    "riera et al .  1995 ; klochkova et al .  1999 ; blcker et al .",
    "2001 ) .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the term of superwind has been coined ( renzini  1981 ) to describe the heavy , final tip - agb mass - loss ( @xmath97  @xmath63  yr@xmath98 ) , which is required to form a planetary nebula of typically tenths of a solar mass within several 10@xmath13 yr .",
    "the idea of a star terminating its agb life with a superwind has been also elaborated by bowen & willson  ( 1991 ) .",
    "these authors showed that all stars undergo the superwind phase as a result of an increase in scale height and density at the condensation radius as the star evolves toward the tip of the agb .",
    "analytical expressions to describe this phase of high mass - loss have been presented by different authors , e.g. by vassiliadis & wood  ( 1993 , hereafter vw93 ) , blcker  ( 1995 ) , salasnich , bressan , & chiosi  ( 1999 ) .",
    "vw93 computed the effects of thermal pulses on mass - loss rates and suggested that a star may undergo several superwind phases and that more massive stars will stay longer in the superwind phase than lower mass stars .",
    "for the agb models discussed in this section the superwind prescription follows the formula of vw93 ( without the correction for masses above 2.5 @xmath60 ) @xmath99 where the mass - loss rate is in @xmath63  yr@xmath98 and @xmath100 is the pulsation period in days .",
    "note that the mass - loss rate is truncated at @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the stellar luminosity , corresponding to a radiation - pressure driven wind . again from vw93 we take the wind expansion velocity ( in km  s@xmath98 ) @xmath103 ranging between 3.0 and 15.0 km  s@xmath98 .",
    "the @xmath0li  yields are very sensitive not only on the extent of the hbb , but also on the mass - loss rate prescriptions .",
    "as first qualitatively pointed by abia , isen , & canal ( 1993 ) , it is not clear if during the super - li rich phase agb stars are able to inject @xmath0li into the interstellar medium by the high mass - loss rate before @xmath0li is depleted in the atmosphere .",
    "we analyze this point with our models , and we plot in figure  4 the surface @xmath0li  abundance as a function of the mass - loss rate for the nine models described in the previous section .",
    "the figure shows that only in a few cases does the star achieve very high mass - loss rates ( @xmath104  @xmath60  yr@xmath98 ) when the surface @xmath0li  abundances is still high ( @xmath7  @xmath105 ) .",
    "when this happens the overall @xmath0li  yield is positive , or only slightly negative . in the first three columns of table  1 we report the @xmath0li  yields ( in @xmath60 ) obtained with these models , showing that only in the case of 4 @xmath60  and @xmath70 the @xmath0li  yield is positive .",

    ". +    pop .",
    "i low mass giant stars ( @xmath106 4 @xmath63 ) are thought to produce li both in the rgb and agb phases .",
    "more specifically , low mass stars , below 2.5 @xmath63 , produce @xmath0li  in the rgb and in the agb by a deep mixing process such as explored by wasserburg , boothroyd , & sackmann  1995 , and sackmann & boothroyd  1999 , hereafter sb99 .",
    "this process is sometimes called cool bottom processing . we prefer to refer to this as `` deep mixing '' because it is more indicative of the physics involved : the cool bottom of the envelope does not play any role .",
    "the nuclear processing occurs at the top of the h - shell and this is facilitated by mixing from the bottom of the convective envelope down to the deeper layers of the h - shell .",
    "this mechanism needs to be further explored to see if it can be efficient also in the mass range 2.5 @xmath107 4.0 .    according to stellar evolution models ,",
    "rgb stars should be characterized by a relatively low @xmath0li  content : stars that leave the ms undepleted in @xmath0li  , after the first - dredge up dilution has occurred , are expected to have @xmath0li  abundances of the order of @xmath7  @xmath108 ( iben 1965 , 1967a , b ) .",
    "since most stars destroy @xmath0li  on the ms , their @xmath0li  content when they reach the rgb and in immediately subsequent phases should be much lower than the above values .",
    "most field and cluster rgb stars show in fact very low @xmath0li  abundances ( @xmath109 @xmath7  @xmath110 ) , even lower than predicted by the models .",
    "an extra  mixing mechanism has been proposed to explain those low abundances ( see e.g. charbonnel , brown , & wallerstein  1998 ; charbonnel & balachandran  2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , after the first discovery by wallerstein & sneden ( 1982 ) of a li - rich rgb ( i.e. a rgb star with a @xmath0li  abundance higher than model predictions ) , several other li - rich giants have been found ( for recent surveys , see castilho et al .",
    "1998 ; jasniewicz et al .",
    "note that , although the number of presently known li - rich rgb stars is relatively high , they represent only 12  % of all the giants with @xmath0li  measurements ( wallerstein & sneden  1982 ; gratton & dantona  1989 ; pilachowski , hudek , & sneden  1990 ; pallavicini et al .",
    "1990 ; fekel & balachandran  1993 ) .",
    "some of these li - rich rgb stars have abundances even higher than the present ism value ( de la reza & da silva  1995 ; balachandran  2000 ) .",
    "various suggestions have been made to explain the li - rich giants with @xmath7  @xmath111 ( for stars with @xmath112 @xmath7  @xmath113 a fresh @xmath0li  production is not necessary since their @xmath0li  abundance is consistent with the first dredge - up values ) .",
    "the high @xmath0li  content of these giants may be related to external processes ( alexander  1967 ; gratton & dantona  1989 ; siess & livio  1999 ) or to internal processes such as the production of fresh @xmath0li  ( fekel & balachandran  1993 ; de la reza , drake , & da silva  1996 ; sb99 ) . as shown by sb99",
    ", @xmath0li  can be created in low - mass rgb stars via the cameron - fowler mechanism associated with a deep - mixing below the convective envelope .",
    "this internal circulation ( possibly driven by stellar rotation ) transports envelope material into the outer wing of the h - burning shell , where it undergoes partial nuclear processing , and then back to the envelope .",
    "sb99 choosed the free parameters of their model to match the low value of @xmath77c/@xmath114c observed in rgb stars .",
    "in order to produce the required additional @xmath114c , the advected material must reach temperatures high enough that @xmath53he is burned , resulting in the creation of @xmath0be via @xmath53he(@xmath11,@xmath115)@xmath0be .",
    "if extra - mixing is slow , @xmath0be is destroyed via @xmath0be(@xmath116,@xmath115)@xmath117b(@xmath118,@xmath119)@xmath117be or @xmath0b(@xmath120,@xmath119)@xmath0li , and any @xmath0li  produced from @xmath0be electron captures is immediately burned up via @xmath0li(@xmath116,@xmath11)@xmath13he .",
    "however , for higher mixing speed @xmath0be can be transported out to cooler regions before electron capture takes place and the stellar envelope becomes enriched in @xmath0li  .",
    "the production of @xmath0li  in rgb stars is dependent on the mixing - speed , i.e. the stream mass flow rate .",
    "sb99 discussed the range of values of this mixing - speed and argued that it must be slower than the velocity of convection in rgb or agb ( @xmath80 1 @xmath60  yr@xmath98 ) , while the streams must move faster than the speed with which the h - shell burns its way outward .",
    "we show in table  3 how the different values for the mixing - speed can influence the @xmath0li  production ( see also sb99 for more details on the 1 @xmath60  model ) .",
    "it is important to notice that , as discussed by e.g. charbonnel  ( 1994 ) and boothroyd & sackmann  ( 1999 ) , the mass range in which the deep mixing is active is @xmath80 1.02.5  @xmath60 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for low mass stars ( @xmath121  @xmath60 ) , the h - burning shell catches up to and erases the discontinuity while the star is still on the rgb ; for higher masses ( @xmath122 2.5  @xmath60 ) the star leaves the rgb before this can take place .",
    "we use the models by sb99 to estimate the contribution of low - mass rgb stars to the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath0li  production phase on the rgb is short ( @xmath71  yr ) compared to the total red giant lifetime ( @xmath123  yr ) , and since the typical rgb mass - loss rate is rather low , they are not expected to contribute significantly to the @xmath0li  enrichment in the ism . on the other hand , during the tp - agb phase , because of the higher mass - loss rate , the contribution to the @xmath0li  ism enrichment can be substantial .",
    "for these reasons , and since sb99 do not present specific @xmath0li  predictions for the agb phase , in this work we make the following assumptions .",
    "we consider the sb99 @xmath0li  predictions at the end of the rgb phase ( when @xmath124 ) for 1  @xmath60  at two different metallicities ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) and for three different cases of mixing - speed ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129  @xmath60  yr@xmath98 ) . to obtain the yield of @xmath0li  from these models we multiply the @xmath0li  abundances by the total mass ejected , e.g. for 1 @xmath60  model we used @xmath130  @xmath60  ( see e.g. weidemann  1984 for the initial - final mass relationship ) .",
    "we assume a mass range of 12.5 @xmath60 , in agreement with the above discussion , and since the authors showed only the results for the 1 @xmath60  model , we interpolate the @xmath0li  production by deep mixing in the mass range 1  @xmath60   2.5  @xmath60 . to derive the 2.5  @xmath60  @xmath0li  yields we follow sb99 assuming that all @xmath53he is converted in @xmath0li  , and that the abundance of @xmath53he in stars scales as @xmath131 ( schatzman  1987 ) .",
    "the @xmath0li  yields obtained for 1  @xmath60  and 2.5  @xmath60 , with different metallicities and different mixing speed , are shown in table  3 . in our calculations , in order to derive an upper limit to the @xmath0li  production , we adopt the highest @xmath0li  abundance predicted by the sb99 models , i.e. that obtained with the model with 10@xmath132 @xmath60  yr@xmath98 mixing speed .    the contribution of low - mass giant stars to the galactic evolution of @xmath0li  is shown in figure  8 .",
    "these stars enrich @xmath0li  up to @xmath133 at the epoch of formation of the sun , i.e. @xmath134% of the solar value .",
    "again , another more efficient source is required to explain the ism @xmath0li  abundance . as in the case of snii ( fig .",
    "7 ) we show for comparison the contribution from these stars to @xmath0li  enrichment starting with a zero initial @xmath0li  composition .",
    "we have addressed the long - standing problem of the galactic chemical evolution of @xmath0li  with the aim of clarifying the role of the different stellar contributions . we have analyzed four possible stellar sources of @xmath0li  : snii , novae , low - mass giants and ims - agb stars . for low - mass giants , novae , and snii we have critically examined the available @xmath0li  yields and discussed the possible extrapolations when no model predictions were available . in the case of snii and novae",
    "we re - examined the @xmath0li  yields in the light of recent hydrodynamical computations . for ims - agb stars we presented and used here new results for nucleosynthesis calculations based on evolutionary agb models by frost  ( 1997 ) . in particular",
    ", we discussed how the interplay between the hbb process and a phase of high mass - loss before the evolution off the agb may constitute a key process for @xmath0li  enrichment in the galaxy . although we are not yet able to quantify the contribution of ims - agb stars , we have explored different realistic possibilities in terms of mass - loss rate and mass range for the hbb process .",
    "the work presented here is summarized in figure  9 , where we compare the results of our model of chemical evolution with the sample of observational data presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the predicted @xmath0li  abundance resulting from all stellar sources considered in this paper is plotted in fig .",
    "9 vs. metallicity ( upper panel ) and vs. time ( lower panel ) . for ims - agb we used a vw93 mass - loss",
    "increased by a factor of 50 ( as discussed in ",
    "4.2 ) , and we have also taken into account the results obtained for the 3  @xmath60  agb model presented in ",
    "4.3 .    as we discussed in sect .  2.1",
    ", we also ran our model with an initial @xmath0li  abundance higher by a factor 2 than the spite plateau value .",
    "the result is shown for comparison in fig .",
    "notice that the predicted @xmath0li  abundance at the time of formation of the sun is virtually the same in both cases . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "9 we plot the individual contributions from the different stellar sources , with the exception of the contribution from snii since we believe that the inclusion of rotation and mixing in the supernova models leads to a drastic reduction of the @xmath0li  yields ( see   6 ) .",
    "note that , from an observational point of view , it is critical to determine the metallicity where the rise of the @xmath0li  abundance from the spite plateau occurs ; the available data indicate that the rise from the plateau occurs at metallicities [ fe / h ] between @xmath135 and @xmath136 , but additional data in the metallicity range @xmath137 [ fe / h ] @xmath138 are needed in order to better constrain this value .",
    "( _ i _ ) in the light of the available stellar models , small contributions to the meteoritic @xmath0li  abundance come from novae ( @xmath139% or less , see   5 ) and low - mass giant stars ( @xmath140% ,",
    "see   7 ) . as for snii",
    ", we predict a contribution to the solar system @xmath0li  abundance of @xmath141% with the standard yields by woosley & weaver  ( 1995 ) , and a contribution less than 10% if the results of the latest hydrodynamical simulations of the supernova explosion are taken into account ( see   6 ) .",
    "spallation reactions between ism and cosmic - ray nuclei can provide an additional at least @xmath420% of the @xmath0li  abundance in the solar system ( see e.g. lemoine et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "( _ ii _ ) figure  9 shows that even with our best - fit model we are not able to reproduce the meteoritic abundance , although both cluster and ism abundances are fitted fairly well .",
    "our best - fit model is in good agreement with the observed @xmath7  vs. [ fe / h ] distribution up to [ fe / h ] @xmath142 .",
    "this indicates that the metallicity at which the rise from the spite plateau occurs is consistent with the [ fe / h ] values at which the ims - agb stars contribute to the chemical enrichment of the ism .",
    "we remind that the observational data for [ fe / h ] @xmath143 are mostly taken from balachandran  ( 1990 ) ( see discussion in ",
    "2 ) ; nevertheless , as the comparison between photometric and spectroscopic metallicities shows , part of these stars might have higher [ fe / h ] values .    ( _ iii _ ) our best - fit model and ,",
    "more specifically , the contribution from ims - agb , is based on two major assumptions : first the high mass - loss phase at the end of the evolution of these stars must start _ earlier _ on the agb than the standard predictions by vw93 .",
    "this is supported by recent ir observations , discussed in   4 .",
    "second , we also need a contribution to @xmath0li  through hbb production from stars with 3 @xmath60  @xmath144  @xmath60  and low metallicities ( see preliminary model results for @xmath145  @xmath60  in lattanzio et al .",
    "should these two assumptions be not valid , the contribution from intermediate - mass agb would be much lower .",
    "we stress however that , since neither novae , nor snii , nor low - mass giant stars seem to produce enough @xmath0li  to account for the present - day abundance , we believe that intermediate - mass agb stars remain at present the best candidates as @xmath0li  factories .    our results and conclusions are strongly based on the agb models discussed in   4 ( see also frost  1997 ) .",
    "a different view has been recently expressed by ventura et al .",
    "they presented a grid of ims - agb models of different masses and tested the sensitivity of @xmath0li  yields to different mass - loss rate prescriptions on the basis of a comparison with agb stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "ventura et al .  ( 2000 ) concluded that , with their mass - loss calibration , ims - agb stars do not contribute significantly to the @xmath0li  enrichment of the ism .",
    "as they properly noticed , details of @xmath0li  production depend on the input parameters of the stellar model , mainly the treatment of convection .",
    "in addition , ventura et al .  ( 2000 ) focused their work on the analysis of the strength of the mass - loss rate during the agb phase .",
    "we instead followed a different approach , testing different times during the agb phase at which the high mass - loss rate starts , and looking for the consequences on @xmath0li  yields . as we demonstrated in   4 ,",
    "anticipating by few thermal pulses the beginning of the superwind phase can have significant impact in the mass of @xmath0li  ejected .",
    "work in progress includes an extension of the grid of agb models to lower masses ( @xmath146  @xmath60 ) and lower metallicities ( @xmath147 ) ( see preliminary results in lattanzio et al .",
    "2001 ) , in order to analyze the possibility of @xmath0li  production via hbb in these stars .",
    "another interesting point that we just mentioned in this paper , is a re - analysis of the contribution of gcr to the production of @xmath0li  ( valle et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "finally , new @xmath0li  data for a statistically significant sample of stars in the critical metallicity range @xmath148 [ fe / h ] @xmath149 are being analyzed ; the data will provide stringent observational constraints on the galactic @xmath0li  abundance in a metallicity range where ims - agb stars are expected , on the basis of this work , to give their main contribution .",
