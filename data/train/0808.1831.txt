    "indeed , write @xmath247 where the sum runs over all distinct eigenvalues @xmath223 , @xmath117 of @xmath89 , and where @xmath248 ( @xmath249 ) is the corresponding eigenspace , i.e. , @xmath250 the eigenspaces are all mutually orthogonal , viz , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 , for @xmath254 .",

    "the present symmetry considerations imply that model spaces obeying as many symmetries as possible should be favored over less symmetric model spaces , since these other model spaces become less `` natural '' or `` less effective '' in the sense that their geometry is less similar to the original hilbert space .",
    "this is most easily seen from the fact that principal vectors are eigenvectors for the conserved observable @xmath89 .",
    "this may well have great consequences for the widely - used sub - cluster approximation to the effective hamiltonian in no - core shell model calculations @xcite , where one constructs the effective hamiltonian for a system of @xmath13 particles in order to obtain an approximation to the @xmath259-body effective hamiltonian .",
    "the model space in this case is constructed in different ways in different implementations .",
    "some of these model spaces may therefore be better than others due to different symmetry properties .",
    "since computer calculations are invariably done using matrices for operators , we here present matrix expressions for @xmath151 and compare them to those usually programmed in the literature , as well as expressions for @xmath131 and @xmath142 .",
    "recall the standard basis @xmath260 of @xmath7 , where the @xmath10 constitute a basis for @xmath4 .",
    "these are usually eigenvectors of the unperturbed `` zero order '' hamiltonian @xmath11 , but we will not use this assumption .",
    "as previously we also assume without loss that the eigenpairs we wish to approximate in @xmath3 are @xmath144 .    an operator @xmath261 has a matrix @xmath262 associated with it .",
    "the matrix elements are given by @xmath263 such that @xmath264 similarly , any vector @xmath265 has a column vector @xmath266 associated with it , with @xmath267 .",
    "we will also view dual vectors , e.g. , @xmath268 , as row vectors .    the model space @xmath4 and the excluded space @xmath30 are conveniently identified with @xmath269 and @xmath270 , respectively . also note that @xmath32 , @xmath271 , etc .",
    ", are identified with the upper left @xmath272 , upper right @xmath273 , etc . , blocks of @xmath274 as in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : blocks ] ) .",
    "we use a notation inspired by fortran and matlab and write @xmath275 and so forth .",
    "we introduce the unitary operator @xmath276 as @xmath277 i.e. , a basis change from the chosen standard basis to the eigenvector basis .",
    "the columns of @xmath278 are the eigenvectors components in the standard basis , i.e. , @xmath279 and are typically the eigenvectors returned from a computer implementation of the spectral decomposition , viz , @xmath280 the svd is similarly transformed to matrix form .",
    "the svd defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : svd ] is then formulated as follows : for any matrix @xmath281 there exist matrices @xmath282 ( @xmath283 ) and @xmath284 , such that @xmath285 ( the identity matrix @xmath286 ) , and a non - negative diagonal matrix @xmath287 such that @xmath288 here , @xmath289 , @xmath43 being the singular values .    the columns of @xmath290 are the left singular vectors components , i.e. , @xmath291 , and similarly for @xmath292 and the right singular vectors .",
    "the difference between the two svd formulations is then purely geometric , as the matrix formulation favorizes the standard bases in @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    the present version of the matrix svd is often referred to as the `` economic '' svd , since the matrices @xmath290 and @xmath292 may be extended to unitary matrices over @xmath293 and @xmath294 , respectively , by adding singular values @xmath48 , @xmath232 .",
    "the matrix @xmath295 is then a @xmath296 matrix with `` diagonal '' given by @xmath43 .",
    "this is the `` full '' svd , equivalent to our basis - free definition .",
    "let the @xmath5 eigenvectors @xmath0 be calculated and arranged in a matrix @xmath278 , i.e. , @xmath297 ( where the subscript does _ not _ pick a single component ) . consider the operator @xmath188 defined in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) , whose matrix columns are the bloch - brandow effective eigenvectors @xmath133",
    "in the standard basis , viz , @xmath298 the columns of the matrix of @xmath299 are the canonical effective eigenvectors @xmath300 . the svd ( [ eq : u - svd ] ) can be written @xmath301 which gives @xmath302 since @xmath303 , we obtain @xmath304 which gives , when applied to @xmath305 @xmath306 thus , we obtain the canonical effective eigenvectors by taking the matrix svd of @xmath307 and multiplying together the matrices of singular vectors . as efficient and robust svd implementations",
    "are almost universally available , e.g. , in the lapack library , this makes the canonical effective interaction much easier to compute compared to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : effham - old ] ) , viz , @xmath308 this version requires one svd computation and three matrix multiplications , all with @xmath272 matrices , one of which is diagonal . equation ( [ eq : effham - old ] ) requires , on the other hand , several more matrix multiplications , inversions and the square root computation .",
    "the bloch - brandow effective hamiltonian is simply calculated by @xmath309    for the record , the matrix of @xmath142 is given by @xmath310 although we have no use for it when using the svd based algorithm .",
    "it may be useful , though , to be able to compute the principal vectors for @xmath4 and @xmath72 .",
    "for this , one may compute the svd of @xmath142 or of @xmath311 , the latter which gives @xmath312 , @xmath102 and @xmath98 directly in the standard basis as singular values and vectors , respectively .",
    "we have characterized the effective hamiltonians commonly used in nuclear shell - model calculations in terms of geometric properties of the spaces @xmath4 and @xmath72 .",
    "the svd and the principal angles and vectors were central in the investigation . while the bloch - brandow effective hamiltonian is obtained by orthogonally projecting @xmath72 onto @xmath4 , thereby _ globally _ minimizing the norm - error of the effective eigenvectors , the canonical effective hamiltonian is obtained by rotating @xmath72 into @xmath4 using @xmath313 , which minimizes the norm - error while retaining orthonormality of the effective eigenvectors .",
    "moreover , we obtained a complete description of the de - coupling operator @xmath142 in terms of the principal angles and vectors defining @xmath130 .",
    "an important question is whether the present treatment generalizes to infinite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "our analysis fits into the general assumptions in the literature , being that @xmath314 is large but finite , or at least that the spectrum of @xmath19 purely discrete .",
    "a minimal requirement is that @xmath19 has @xmath5 eigenvalues , so that @xmath72 can be constructed .",
    "in particular , the svd generalizes to finite rank operators in the infinite dimensional case , and are thus valid for all the operators considered here even when @xmath315 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath19 has almost never a purely discrete spectrum .",
    "it is well - known that the spectrum in general has continuous parts and resonances embedded in these , and a proper theory should treat these cases as well as the discrete part .",
    "in fact , the treatments of @xmath3 in the literature invariably glosses over this . it is an interesting future project to develop a geometric theory for the effective hamiltonians which incorporates resonances and continuous spectra .    the geometrical view simplified and unified the available treatments in the literature somewhat , and offered further insights into the effective hamiltonians .",
    "moreover , the the symmetry considerations in sec .",
    "[ sec : commuting - observables ] may have significant bearing on the analysis of perturbation expansions and the properties of sub - cluster approximations to @xmath151 .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see , that if we have a _ complete _ set of commuting observables ( csco ) @xcite for @xmath11 , and the same set of observables form a csco for @xmath9 , all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath316 are analytic in @xmath317 , implying that the rayleigh - schroedinger perturbation series for @xmath8 converges ( i.e. , at @xmath318 ) @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the fewer commuting observables we are able to identify , the more likely it is that there are singularities in @xmath319 , so called intruder states .",
    "the rayleigh - schroedinger series diverges outside the singularity closest to @xmath320 @xcite , and in nuclear systems this singularity is indeed likely to be close to @xmath320 . on the other hand , resummation of the series",
    "can be convergent and yield an analytic continuation of @xmath3 outside the region of convergence @xcite . to the author s knowledge",
    ", there is no systematic treatment of this phenomenon in the literature . on the contrary , to be able to do such a resummation is sort of a `` holy grail '' of many - body perturbation theory .",
    "a geometric study of the present kind to many - body perturbation theory and diagram expansions may yield a step closer to this goal , as we have clearly identified the impact of commuting observables on the principal vectors of @xmath72 and @xmath4 .",
    "we have also discussed a compact algorithm in terms of matrices to compute @xmath151 , relying on the svd . to the author s knowledge , this algorithm is previously unpublished . since robust and fast svd implementations are readily available , e.g. , in the lapack library , and since few other matrix manipulations are needed , it should be preferred in computer implementations .    as stressed in the introduction , the algorithms presented are really only useful if we compute the _ exact _ effective hamiltonian , as opposed to a many - body perturbation theoretical calculation , and if we know what exact eigenpairs to use , such as in a sub - cluster approximation . in this case",
    ", one should analyze the error in the approximation , i.e. , the error in neglecting the many - body correlations in @xmath151 . in the perturbative regime , some results exist @xcite .",
    "the author believes , that the geometric description may facilitate a deeper analysis , and this is an interesting idea for future work .",
