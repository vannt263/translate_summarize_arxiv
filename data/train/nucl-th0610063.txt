    "as the fireball of a nucleus - nucleus collision cools down below a certain freeze out temperature @xmath0 mev the inelastic ( chemical freeze out ) and elastic ( kinetic freeze out ) collisions among the hadrons cease .",
    "this process is usually called the freeze out scenario ( fo ) .",
    "several approaches have been applied for the description of the freeze out of strongly interacting matter .",
    "especially , there are kinetic models  @xcite as well as hydrodynamical approaches  @xcite which have been proven to be able to describe most of the collective phenomena like the different flow components in heavy - ion reactions . despite the success in comparison with experiments ,",
    "the in - medium modifications of the hadrons during the freeze out process have not been taken into account yet . in all of the former evaluations",
    "the vacuum parameters of the particles have been implemented . however , during the freeze out process , the temperature and particle densities are presumably close to the deconfinement phase transition critical values @xcite .",
    "accordingly , strong in - medium modifications of hadronic properties like mass , width , coupling constants etc . , are expected .",
    "the question arises how strong their impact on the freeze out process is . for answering this issue",
    "we study a nucleon gas and investigate how strong the impact of an in - medium nucleon mass shift on the thermodynamical parameters , temperature , flow - velocity , energy density and particle density , of the freeze out scenario is .",
    "the theoretical description of the kinetic freeze out within a hydrodynamical approach has been worked out some years ago ; see @xcite and references therein . here , the evaluations presented are based on the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the freeze out description has been generalized to the case of a finite time - like layer ( a finite space - like layer has also been investigated in @xcite ; more details about the approach presented will be published in @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , local equilibrium implies that the thermodynamical parameters inside the layer become space - time dependent , i.e. we have a space - time dependent temperature @xmath1 , flow velocity @xmath2 , energy density @xmath3 and nucleon density @xmath4 . from the equations of hydrodynamics we derive the following set of coupled differential equations for three unknowns d e ( x ) & = & u _ ( x ) d t^ ( x )",

    "another lorentz frame , e.g. rest frame of the front ( rff ) , can be defined by a lorentz boost in respect to rfg .    since there are four unknowns in the problem under consideration an additional constraint is necessary , which is provided by the equation of state ( eos ) for the nucleon gas @xcite e ( x ) = n ( x ) .",

    "accordingly , the four equations ( [ hydro_35 ] ) , ( [ hydro_40 ] ) , ( [ hydro_45 ] ) and ( [ eos_5 ] ) represent a closed set for evaluating the four unknowns @xmath17 of the one - particle system .",
    "furthermore , as the system expands and cools down the number of interacting particles decreases up to the post freeze out surface of the finite layer , where by definition the density of interacting particles vanishes .",
    "correspondingly , the particle distribution function is decomposed into two components , an interacting part @xmath18 and a non - interacting part @xmath19 , thus @xmath20 . accordingly",
    ", there is an interacting particle density @xmath21 and a non - interacting particle density @xmath22 with @xmath23 . on the pre - freeze out hypersurface",

    "the physical reason for a faster freeze out originates from a smaller energy density of the nucleon system due to a smaller nucleon mass @xmath68 compared to the vacuum nucleon mass @xmath69 .",
    "finally , we remark that in - medium modifications have actually to be taken into account not only during the freeze out process , but also before , i.e. during the hadronization .",

    "special attention has been drawn about the issue how strong the impact of the in - medium nucleon mass modification on the thermal freeze out process is .",
    "by focussing on a purely nucleon gas we have found a substantial effect on the thermodynamical quantities like temperature @xmath43 , flow velocity @xmath70 , particle density @xmath71 and energy density @xmath72 of the interacting component .",
    "all of these thermodynamical functions have revealed a faster freeze out compared to a scenario without an n - medium nucleon mass shift .    in summary , our findings for a nucleon gas suggest that taking into account in - medium modifications of nucleons seems to be necessary and an interesting phenomenon , in particular for collision scenarios with high baryonic densities .",
