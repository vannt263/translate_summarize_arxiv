    "since pareto s revelation that the distribution of wealth follows a power - law@xcite , many researchers have proposed various models to explain this phenomenon .",
    "the simplest of these is the bouchaud - mzard ( bm ) model , which is described by the following stochastic differential equation@xcite ; @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the total number of agents , the wealth of agent @xmath8 , a diffusion constant , an adjacent matrix , the noise strength , and normal brownian motion , respectively .",
    "bouchaud and mzard@xcite analyzed this model for a globally coupled network , i. e. , @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , and found that , although @xmath11 does not have a stationary distribution , the normalized wealth @xmath12 does and its probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath13 is given by @xmath14x^{-2-\\mu_n},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 ( here and in the following , we denote the normalized wealth by @xmath11 ) .",
    "the pdf obeys the power law @xmath16 as @xmath17 , where the exponent is @xmath18 .",
    "real economic networks , however , are not globally coupled networks , and so the original bm model is extended to that on a complex network .",
    "however , it has been shown that the properties of the bm model on a complex network differ from those on a globally coupled network .",
    "bouchaud and mzard@xcite also reported that , while the mean - field analysis always gives an exponent larger than 2 , a smaller exponent can be seen in numerical simulations on a regular random network .",
    "this result seems plausible because the real wealth distribution often shows an exponent that is smaller than 2@xcite .",
    "so far , a number of papers have been published on this system .",
    "for example , garlaschelli and loffredo proposed to fit the distribution by @xmath19@xcite .",
    "proposed another assumption that the pdf is given generalized inverse gamma distribution@xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the exponent @xmath20 was obtained by fitting the result of numerical simulations , however , no one had succeeded to obtain @xmath20 analytically .",
    "we recently obtained the wealth distribution of the bm model on the complex network analytically in the case of @xmath21@xcite .",
    "however , these analysis can not be applied when @xmath22 , because we derive the result using the central limit theorem .",
    "we can apply the central limit theorem only when the variance is finite , therefore this theorem is not applicable when @xmath22 .    here , a study of the power - law tail of the bm model on a regular random network when @xmath22 is presented .",
    "the applications of the generalized central limit theorem and the tauberian theorem are a key part of this theory . using these theorems",
    ", we derive two equations that relate the pdf of the wealth to that of the average of wealth around each node .",
    "these two equations lead us to a simple equation that determines the exponent of the stationary wealth distribution .",
    "the result shows that the exponent can be smaller than @xmath23 , which implies that `` wealth condensation''(a small number of agents control the greater part of the wealth ) can occur .",
    "we first develop the theory for the wealth distribution of the bm model on a regular random network in sec .",
    "[ 084857_10apr13 ] , and compare the numerical simulation results with our analysis in sec .",
    "[ 132621_9apr13 ] .",
    "we summarize the result and discuss the generalization of our theory and remaining problems in sec .",
    "[ 152701_16apr13 ] .",
    "following the theory presented in @xcite , we make `` adiabatic '' and `` independent '' assumptions .",
    "we assume that the pdf of the wealth on each node is independent , allowing the total pdf @xmath24 to be decomposed as @xmath25 . in the case of a regular random network in which all nodes have degree @xmath26",
    ", @xmath27 can be assumed to be independent of the index @xmath8 , i. e. , @xmath28 .",
    "we also assume `` adiabaticity '' , that is , @xmath3 varies much faster than the `` local mean - field '' @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 is constant , the conditional pdf of @xmath3 , @xmath31 , is given by the stationary solution of the following fokker - planck equation : @xmath32 + \\sigma^2 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2 }    [ x_i^2 \\rho_i].\\label{162421_3apr13}\\ ] ] it can be shown that @xmath33 is the stationary solution of this equation , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 . under the adiabatic assumption , @xmath30 changes at a much slower rate than @xmath3 , and so @xmath13 can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the distribution of the average of the wealth around node @xmath8 .    to calculate the exponent as @xmath0",
    ", we assume that @xmath38 and @xmath22 .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the numerical simulations results for small @xmath39 that are presented in sec . [",
    "132621_9apr13 ] .",
    "under this assumption , we can obtain two equations that relate the tail of @xmath13 to @xmath40 as @xmath0 .",
    "the first of these equations is derived by applying the generalized central limit theorem@xcite . because the standard deviation of @xmath11 diverges",
    ", we can assume that @xmath41 as @xmath42 and @xmath43 . under the independent assumption",
    ", we can apply the generalized central limit theorem , and the distribution of @xmath44 can be approximated by the stable distribution @xmath45 for large @xmath26 , where @xmath46^{1/\\alpha }   k^{-1/\\alpha}$ ] , and @xmath47 is the stable distribution function whose characteristic function is given by @xmath48 $ ] for @xmath49 and @xmath50 $ ] for @xmath51 . in both cases ,",
    "the tail of @xmath52 , which is the pdf of the stable distribution @xmath45 , is given by @xmath53 for @xmath0@xcite .",
    "here , we note that the tail of pdf of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the same for @xmath42 .    by assuming that @xmath56 and @xmath57 as @xmath58 , we obtain the following equations from eq.([161104_2apr13 ] ) and the expression for @xmath59 ; @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 these equations lead to @xmath63 which is the first equation we use to determine the exponent @xmath20 .    the second equation is obtained using the tauberian theorem .",
    "we introduce the laplace transformation of @xmath64 , @xmath65 the tauberian theorem states that @xmath66 as @xmath67 is equivalent to @xmath68 as @xmath0 , provided that @xmath69 .",
    "( [ 144129_18mar13 ] ) , ( [ 092714_2apr13 ] ) and ( [ 144057_18mar13 ] ) indicate that @xmath13 can be obtained from @xmath70 , the laplace transformation of @xmath71 , as @xmath72 using the fact that @xmath73 as @xmath0 and the assumption @xmath74 , we can apply the tauberian theorem to calculate @xmath75 as @xmath0 ; @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the second equation , @xmath78    combining eqs.([095908_19mar13 ] ) and ( [ 095922_19mar13 ] ) , we can determine the exponent @xmath20 from @xmath79    there are a few things to note about this equation .",
    "first , this equation is always satisfied when @xmath80 ; however , it seems counterintuitive that @xmath20 does not depend on the parameter @xmath4 , and so we take the solution that satisfies @xmath81 as the `` real '' distribution .",
    "second , it should also be noted that in general this equation can not be solved analytically , but we can obtain @xmath39 in some special cases , e. g. , when @xmath82 . in this case ,",
    "eq.([124304_19mar13 ] ) gives @xmath83 the solution to this equation , @xmath84 implies that the variance of the wealth becomes finite when @xmath85 .",
    "this result is consistent with that in our previous paper@xcite , in which we investigated the wealth distribution when @xmath21 .",
    "third , we note also that in the limit @xmath86 , we obtain @xmath87 from eq.([124304_19mar13 ] ) , which is the solution of the mean - field analysis ; as @xmath86 , the right hand side of eq.([124304_19mar13 ] ) diverges for @xmath88 , and is 0 for @xmath89 . from the fact that @xmath90 has no zero point on the real axis and diverges at @xmath91",
    ", we conclude that @xmath92 as @xmath26 increases , which is consistent with the results of the mean - field analysis . in a final remark about eq.([124304_19mar13 ] ) , we see that there is a solution @xmath93 for small @xmath39 , as we show in sec .",
    "[ 132621_9apr13 ] .",
    "this appears to be paradoxical , because the average of the normalized wealth must be 1 , while it diverges if @xmath93 .",
    "this paradox is a result of the independent assumption ; because the sum of @xmath3 is conserved , @xmath3 and @xmath30 are related through @xmath94 . in the case of @xmath95 ,",
    "this restriction is negligible , because @xmath96 for all nodes .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath97 , the wealth of the richest node @xmath98 becomes @xmath99 , and the correlation is not negligible .",
    "therefore for @xmath100 the distribution will differ from that derived here ; our theory can only be applied in in the region @xmath101 .    before concluding this section",
    ", we make a remark on the generalization of our method to a general complex network .",
    "we assume again adiabaticity and independency , and we also assume that the pdf of @xmath3 and that of the local mean - field @xmath30 at node @xmath8 are given by @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath104 , respectively . under these assumptions , all @xmath105 belong to the same domain of attraction of a stable distribution function .",
    "in this case , the distribution of the sum @xmath106 can be obtained from the generalized central limit theorem@xcite , which leads to @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the degree of node @xmath8 . by also using the tauberian theorem",
    "we also get @xmath109 and by eliminating @xmath110 from eqs.([144503_4apr13 ] ) and ( [ 144511_4apr13 ] ) we obtain @xmath111 which can be rewritten as @xmath112 where @xmath113 therefore we require @xmath20 to satisfy the condition @xmath114 , and we also require the eigenvector of @xmath115 , whose corresponding eigenvalue is zero , to be non - negative , because @xmath116 for all @xmath8 . in the case of a regular random graph",
    ", we can find the solution easily ; first , @xmath117 is proportional to the identity matrix , and the condition @xmath118 means that the diagonal part of @xmath117 is equal to an eigenvalue of @xmath119 .",
    "second , @xmath119 is a non - negative matrix and we can apply the frobenius theorem to find that @xmath119 has a non - negative eigenvector @xmath120 and a corresponding eigenvalue @xmath26 . from these conditions ,",
    "we can easily obtain eq.([124304_19mar13 ] ) . in the case of a general complex network , it is much more difficult to obtain @xmath20 ; @xmath117 is not proportional to the identity matrix , and we need to solve @xmath121 numerically .",
    "moreover , we can not apply the frobenius theorem to obtain non - negative eigenvectors , because @xmath115 is not a non - negative matrix . in this case",
    ", we will need to follow the following procedure to obtain @xmath20 : first , we find the set of @xmath20 s that satisfy @xmath122 .",
    "second , we select those @xmath20 values that give a non - negative eigenvector of @xmath115 whose eigenvalue is zero .",
    "we note that it is difficult to carry out this procedure for a large complex network . in the first step",
    ", we will find a large number of @xmath20 s that satisfy @xmath118 . to estimate the number of solutions of @xmath118",
    ", we consider the case of the regular random graph . in this case , the number of @xmath20 s that satisfy this condition is equal to the number of eigenvalues of @xmath119",
    ". therefore we expect that the number of @xmath20 s that satisfy this condition will be @xmath123 for a large complex network . from this set of @xmath20 s , we need to choose those that have non - negative eigenvectors .",
    "we can not apply the frobenius theorem in the case of general complex network , and we need to calculate the corresponding eigenvectors for each @xmath20 obtained in the first step . and even if we succeeded in doing this , we also need to select one appropriate @xmath20 from this set . in the case of a regular random network",
    ", we always have the solution @xmath80 , which is rejected because it is counterintuitive . however , it is not known whether we can always distinguish appropriate @xmath20 values from inappropriate values simply by intuition .",
    "further work will be necessary to extend this theory to the case of a general complex network .",
    "numerical simulations of the bm model on a regular random graph were carried out for @xmath124 nodes and repeated 10 times using the euler - maruyama algorithm with an initial condition @xmath125 for each parameter .",
    "the distribution at @xmath126 was taken as the stationary distribution , and here we set @xmath127 .    to obtain the exponent at large @xmath11 , we construct a rank plot of @xmath11 ; it has been shown previously that if @xmath16 for @xmath128 , then the wealth of the @xmath129-th richest agent is approximately proportional to @xmath130@xcite .",
    "a rank plot of the wealth for @xmath131 and @xmath132 is shown in fig.[134055_8apr13 ] .",
    "the distribution shows clear power - law behavior in the case of @xmath131 , but not in the case of @xmath132 .",
    "although the exponent @xmath20 seems to be constant at ranks of @xmath133 , it increases for smaller @xmath8 .",
    "this observation is consistent with the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "[ 084857_10apr13 ] . for @xmath134 and @xmath135 ,",
    "76 agents have a wealth larger than 100 , and so we can not assume that @xmath136 in this region . from these observations , we estimate the exponent as @xmath137 , where @xmath3 represents the wealth at rank @xmath8 .",
    "fig.[092544_3apr13 ] compares the exponents obtained in the numerical simulation for several parameters with those of the theory presented in sec .",
    "[ 084857_10apr13 ] .",
    "good agreement is observed , especially in case of @xmath88 , but at lower @xmath20 values there is a small discrepancy between the theoretical and simulation values .",
    "we suspect that this discrepancy is caused by the errors in the estimation of the exponent .",
    "as shown in fig.[134055_8apr13 ] , the wealth distribution does not exhibit a power - law in the case of @xmath93 due to the correlation for large @xmath11 .",
    "we use data that have a rank of larger than 100 to avoid the effect of this correlation ; however , the correlation will still remain .",
    "we also note that @xmath138 becomes too small to assume @xmath139 , which is an assumption used in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ 131829_10apr13 ] ) .",
    "if another method is used to estimate the exponent , such as @xmath140 , then we will obtain a slightly different exponent . despite this problem ,",
    "the difference in the value of the exponent obtained by our theory and that obtained from the numerical simulations is less than @xmath141 , and we can conclude that our theory gives a good estimation of the exponent even in the case of @xmath97 .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the stationary pdf of wealth in the bm model on a regular random network . using the generalized central limit theorem and the tauberian theorem",
    ", we obtained an equation for the tail exponent @xmath20 .",
    "we found that at small coupling the exponent @xmath20 becomes smaller than 2 , and the results of this analysis were in good agreement with those of the numerical simulations .",
    "the first important point to be addressed is the generalization of our theory to the bm model on a complex network . as discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ 084857_10apr13 ] , we need to obtain a value of @xmath20 that satisfies the condition that the matrix @xmath115 has a zero eigenvalue and that the corresponding eigenvector is non - negative . in practice , it is difficult to find a value of @xmath20 that satisfies these conditions . in the case of a regular random graph , we can assume that @xmath142 for all @xmath8 .",
    "this assumption can not be applied if the network is heterogeneous .",
    "numerical simulations on a heterogeneous network may suggest other assumptions on @xmath143 , which would assist in calculating @xmath20 .",
    "the second important point is an estimation of the effects of correlation .",
    "medo@xcite showed that there is a spatial correlation in the bm model on complex networks .",
    "we have already reported that such a correlation is not negligible in the case of a watts - strogatz network@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we found that another kind of correlation emerges from the wealth conservation .",
    "this correlation can occur in any complex network and is not negligible especially for @xmath97 .",
    "further studies for a more accurate estimation of the effects caused by this correlation are needed .",
    "the final point is the unification of this work with our previous work for @xmath144 . in the case of @xmath21",
    ", we can approximate @xmath37 by a gaussian distribution using the central limit theorem .",
    "unfortunately , we can not apply the tauberian theorem in this case .",
    "this theorem is applicable only when @xmath145 for @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is a slowly varying function of @xmath148 , i.e. , @xmath149 as @xmath150 for all @xmath151 .",
    "if @xmath152 is a gaussian , then there is no @xmath147 that satisfies this condition , and so we can not apply the tauberian theorem . we will need another approach to unify both cases into a single theory .",
