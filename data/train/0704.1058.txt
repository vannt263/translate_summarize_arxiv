    "the discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe @xcite has revived questions concerning the domain of validity of einstein s general relativity . at present , the data gathered on the expansion rate do not disclose whether the acceleration is due to a component formally equivalent to the cosmological constant introduced by einstein @xcite , or whether we are finding the effective behavior of a theory of a wider scope whose low energy limit slightly departs from gr .",

    "this result is very encouraging as it supersedes previous dispersion values obtained in samples of supernovae in all galaxy types .",

    "the supernova magnitudes are corrected regularly from galactic extinction @xcite , but the correction by dust residing in the host galaxy or along the line of sight is often not included in the standard fit , as it would require to have extensive color information that might not be available for high  z sne ia .",

    "let us , for instance , consider the correction of dimming by dust as entering in the term @xmath182 , the magnitudes of extinction in the @xmath159 band .",
    "we take , for instance , a supernova of a given stretch s , and we place its @xmath183 ( the magnitude of the equivalent supernova of @xmath160 ) in the hubble diagram .",

    "in fact , the coefficients @xmath185 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 are also determined by methods determining distances to sne ia . in a sample of 133 nearby sne ia , it is found in @xcite , that the dust in their host galaxies is well described by a mean extinction law with @xmath188 @xmath192 2.7 . in all this , the level at which sne ia are treated , including how many bands are used , becomes critical .",
    "a use of sne ia without taking into account color information leads to a dispersion of 0.17mag .",
    "when taking into account color information , the limit goes down to 0.11mag .",
    "limiting the effect of extinction , as in sneia in ellipticals should bring down the dispersion .",
    "this finding is motivating the ongoing sn searches in clusters of elliptical galaxies @xcite . in environments where dust is controlled , such as sne in clusters rich in elliptical galaxies , the systematic effect introduced by dust extinction",

    "the improvement is given for a future mission able to control the systematics in the best possible way .",
    "it is foreseen that several sources of systematic errors will become negligible within the next decade .",
    "this question resides on whether we know that sne ia properties evolve with z. much has been done along this path .",
    "nowadays , while we know that dust is the unavoidable systematics , several studies confirm the universality of the light curve properties of sne ia .",
    "the study of a significant sample of sne ia at various @xmath181 by the supernova cosmology project reveals that the rise times to maximum of high  z sne ia are similar to the low@xmath181 sne ia ( @xcite ) .",

    "statistical evaluation is so far consistent with no difference between the low@xmath181 and high@xmath181 samples .",
    "moreover , the possibility of existence of an extra parameter in the maximum brightness  rate of decline relation has been carefully examined . among possible influences ,",
    "metallicity was one of the obvious ones to consider . examining supernovae in galaxies with a gradient of metallicity , it is found @xcite that there is no evidence for metallicity dependence as an extra parameter in the light curve correlation of sne ia .",
    "this result comes from an analysis of the sne ia light curves of a sample of 62 supernovae in the local universe .",
    "the sne ia belong to different populations along a metallicity gradient .",
    "this check has been done as well at high  z @xcite using 74 sne ia ( 0.17 @xmath79 z @xmath79 0.86 ) from the scp sample .",
    "no significant correlation between peak snia luminosity and metallicity is found .",
    "often we address the question of the spread of the sne ia samples in galaxies of different types : on how many fast sne ia versus intermediate or slow decliners are found in the various morphological types .",
    "spirals at low or moderate redshifts should encompass all ranges of variation in the sne ia properties since they contain populations with a wide spread in age .",
    "the cosmological sn collaborations find that in those samples the one ",
    "parameter correlation does give a good description of the variation of the sne ia light curves : there is no residual correlation after the light  curve shape correction @xcite .",
    "one can go a step further and test the snia objects themselves .",

    "the progress done in this domain is summarized in table i.      there is another element yet to be introduced here : it deals with the k correction .",
    "correction is necessary to calculate the apparent magnitude in a @xmath193 filter band of a source observed in a @xmath194 filter . as we are comparing the observed flux of supernovae in a given spectral band along the expansion history , we need to take into account the effect that the photons of the supernova have shifted to redder wavelengths and spread over a different spectral wavelength range and the observed flux is different from that at emission .",

    "sne ia should show a negligigle systematics caused by gravitational lensing when having a few sneia per redshift bin @xcite .",
    "this means that in future missions that effect should not have impact in limiting the accuracy of @xmath25 .",
    "the better we deal with the light curve and spectral information of sne ia , the lower becomes the dispersion in the hubble diagram . if sne ia have a systematic error in their use ( independently from evolution ) , this is likely well below the accuracy to which we would like to determine distances ( 1@xmath140 ) .",
    "we have not yet hit that brick wall .",
    "using multi ",
    "epoch spectral information and accurate light curves in various filters should enable to test the power of these candles and their limiting irreduceable error @xcite .",
    "supernovae collected along years show the effect of observations treated with various degrees of accuracy .",
    "the dispersion around the best fit reflects that fact .",
    "for instance , some samples would have information on only two colors and at very few epochs , making it difficult to control reddening , or supernovae had no spectrum confirming that they were sne ia .",
    "the new samples will naturally have a higher degree of accuracy in magnitude and extinction for each supernova than previous samples .",
    "the ones with poorer information have been placed in @xcite into the  silver   category ( as opposed to `` gold '' category ) . however , even within the gold sample the requirements have changed : the latest definition of gold sample demands higher quality standards than in @xcite . in some of these sne ia lists , distance moduli of supernovae are assembled but they have been obtained through procedures which deal differently with dust extinction .",
    "the hubble diagram resulting from those compilations would naturally show a large dispersion . in @xcite , it is argued that a few supernovae of an early high z sn search sample are pulling @xmath25 towards evolution . the exploration done with a method independent from that in @xcite showed that the central value in the 1@xmath67 confidence varied according to the light curve and reddening fitter of those sne ia @xcite .",
    "fortunately , supernovae enable to compare results obtained with different light curve fitting approaches .",
    "the published photometry by the various collaborations can be used to bring together the sne ia by using a consistent procedure into the hubble diagram .",
