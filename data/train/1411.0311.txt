    "one of the most pressing and interesting questions in fundamental physics and cosmology today is the identity of the dark matter ( see e.g. @xcite and refs .  therein ) .",
    "the properties of hypothetical dark matter particles remain largely unknown and there are many attempts to find phenomenological constraints on particular models from astronomical observations .",
    "for example , if dark matter particles were born relativistic , deep in the radiation - dominated epoch ( so called `` warm dark matter '' , or wdm ) they would affect the way structures were formed at small scales , leaving their imprints in the lyman-@xmath4 forest ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and satellite galaxy abundances and structure @xcite . satellite structure may also provide limits on dark matter self - interactions @xcite .",
    "one further constraint is the detection of electromagnetic radiation originating from the decay or annihilation of dark matter particles .",
    "many studies to date have centred on attempts to detect the annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "this generic class of particles is attractive as a dark matter candidate due to their stability , their potential relation to electroweak symmetry breaking , and the possibility that they may be detected in laboratory experiments ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "wimps can not decay , but are predicted to annihilate with one another in regions of high dark matter density , and could be detected via their annihilation products .",
    "currently , the most interesting candidate wimp signal is an excess of gev photons from the centre of the galaxy @xcite , but further evidence is needed to rule out a possible astrophysical origin of the signal @xcite .",
    "the interaction strength of weakly interacting massive particles limits their mass to the few gev  few tev range ( in order to give the correct primordial abundance ) .",
    "once the assumption about the interaction strength is relaxed , particle physics theories predict the existence of dark matter of different masses . if the particle mass is at the kev scale , and its lifetime longer than the age of the universe , it may in principle be detectable indirectly , through the observation of x - ray photons produced by its decay  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an x - ray line signal consistent with such a decay has been identified at an energy of @xmath0  kev in galaxy clusters , in the milky way centre ( or galactic centre , gc ) and in m31 by several studies @xcite . although others have reported non - detections @xcite or reported detections but attributed them to have astrophysical origins ( @xcite but see also @xcite ) .",
    "these two classes of systems  clusters and @xmath5 galaxies  are separated in mass by three orders of magnitude , therefore the correlation of the measured signal with expected projected dark matter mass is compelling evidence for dark matter decay as the origin of the signal .",
    "these studies have based their estimates of the dark matter distribution in their targets on dark halo mass models that do not take into account fully the triaxiality of the halo , the presence of substructure , or the effects of baryons .",
    "some of these issues have been examined in @xcite , who used a low resolution cosmological simulation containing @xmath6 milky way halo analogues to motivate better triaxial halo mass models .",
    "we instead make use of a series of high resolution simulations of milky way - analogue dark matter haloes , some of which were run with a full hydrodynamical treatment of the baryonic component , to estimate the x - ray decay signal from these targets and compare the results to the reported detections .",
    "targets such as the milky way and m31 are attractive due to their large projected mass densities , however their analysis is complicated by the presence of x - ray emission lines from the interstellar medium . therefore , the nature of the line  dark matter or astrophysical  may be better ascertained by performing observations of objects with much cleaner backgrounds .",
    "one particularly promising class of candidates is that of the milky way s dwarf spheroidal satellites  @xcite .",
    "these galaxies have very high mass - to - light ratios @xcite , and very low gas fractions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "their x - ray emitting gas fractions will be lower still due to their small gas fractions .",
    "any detection from these galaxies would thus have a very low probability of an astrophysical origin and therefore dwarf spheroidal satellites have previously been targets of decaying dm searches in x - rays @xcite . with our set of simulations we can also set out to calculate the flux from dwarf spheroidals in their full cosmological context , including the contribution from the host halo .",
    "in this work we use the high resolution simulations of the aquarius project @xcite to predict the likely amplitude of the x - ray decay flux observed in the gc relative to that observed in m31 , and also of the gc relative to other parts of the milky way halo and to dwarf spheroidal galaxies . as we shall see , a sufficiently deep observation of the draco dwarf galaxy would allow us to test the dark matter interpretation of the observed x - ray line signal in a very large region of the parameter space .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sims ]",
    "we present the simulations used in this paper .",
    "we discuss our methods for calculating the x - ray flux from the simulations in section  [ mxs ] . in section  [ res ]",
    "we present our results for the expected fluxes of the gc , m31 , and two dwarf spheroidal galaxies , and draw conclusions in section  [ conc ] . in the appendices we test the convergence of the simulations as function of resolution and number of sightlines ( appendix  [ rt ] ) , and consider the effects of cosmology , baryonic physics , and dark matter power spectrum ( appendix  [ mi ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we select draco and sculptor candidate subhaloes as follows . for each of our level 2 simulations we identify subhaloes that are between 88 and 148  kpc from the main halo centre . these values are chosen to increase our sample size beyond what is possible at the true distance of these satellites , such that the observer will be at a distance of 80 - 140kpc from the satellite .",
    "we then draw a sphere of radius equal to the draco / sculptor half - light radii around the subhalo centre .",
    "if the mass enclosed within that radius falls within the published uncertainty on the ` half - light mass ' of the satellite galaxy in question then it is added to our sample . in this way",
    "we obtain 19 candidates for draco and 33 for sculptor .",
    "we place 5000 observers at random within the ring defined such that the observer - main halo distance is 8kpc and the observer - target subhalo distance is either 80 , 90 , 100 , 110 , 120 , 130 , or 140kpc from the centre as permitted by the main halo - subhalo separation .",
    "for subhalo positions such that more than one of these observer - target separations are possible we select the smallest available .",
    "we then calculate the flux from the target at the position of the observers in the same way as for the gc and m31 . by this method",
    "we obtain the combined flux from the subhalo and the outskirts of the main halo .",
    "the results for both draco and sculptor are presented in figure  [ drascu ] .",
    "there is a great deal of variation between different dwarf spheroidal candidates . for draco the peak in the probability distribution may be as much as 20 per cent of the gc or as little as 5 per cent ;",
    "for sculptor the range in peaks is smaller .",
    "it it possible to see the effects of central halo concentration and mass : the aq - d2 results are all clustered towards more modest ratios , as are those of aq - b2 .",
    "we now bring the results from each of these targets together to examine the likelihood that each ( non-)detection is consistent with being generated by a dark matter particle of the same decay lifetime . in figure  [ lflux ]",
    "we plot the flux distributions for each of our targets as a function of projected mass for a series of different decay lifetimes @xmath7 .",
    "we take aq - b2 to be our milky way candidate due to its low mass @xcite , and aq - d2 to be our m31 analogue because of its relatively low concentration@xcite .",
    "we also include the @xmath8 allowed regions for the detections of the gc and m31 , and also @xmath9 upper bounds for the blank sky dataset and draco .",
    "we find that the best agreement between the corresponding simulation predictions and the observational constraints is approximately in the range @xmath10 .",
    "this lifetime agrees within @xmath8 range with the results of  @xcite and is consistent with non - observation of the line from stacked observations of dsphs @xcite where the limit @xmath11 ( @xmath12 upper bound ) was established .",
    "these estimates are based on our haloes that are the best candidate matches for the milky way and gc .",
    "the projected mass will increase if the expected mass or concentration of either target were higher will cause the projected mass to change slightly . a proper implementation of baryon physics in particular will likely increases the projected mass densities ( see appendix  [ mi ] ) .",
    "in addition to the published upper bound from the blank sky observations and also the published detections in the gc and m31 , we include in figure  [ lflux ] the upper limit from the non - detection of draco , as well as an estimate of the sensitivity of xmm - newton with future observations . based on archival data from the xmm - newton observatory ( @xmath13ks of mos1+mos2 instruments , and 40.4ks with pn ) the @xmath9 upper bound is @xmath14 .",
    "simulations using the xspec s",
    "@xcite fakeit command find that a draco flux of @xmath15 would be detected at @xmath12 with an xmm - newton exposure of 1.34  ms .",
    "for values of @xmath16 , 95 per cent of our realizations lead to an x - ray flux from draco consistent with existing upper limits , and within the 3@xmath2 reach of xmm - newton with an exposure of 1.34  ms .",
    "the identity of the dark matter remains unknown .",
    "the detection of a series of unexplained lines in the x - ray spectra of a number of different astrophysical targets are suggested to be consistent with the decay of light dark matter particles .",
    "we have expanded on these studies by estimating the likely distribution of x - ray fluxes from these targets .    to this end",
    "we have used simulations of milky way - analogue dark matter haloes to ascertain the likely signal of the decay of dark matter into x - ray photons from the galactic centre , m31 and two dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "we placed 5000 observers at a distance of 8kpc around the simulated main halo centre and calculated the flux measured within the fov of radius @xmath17 , treating each simulation dark matter particle as a point source of x - ray photons .",
    "this procedure were also performed with observers 780kpc from the halo centre to simulate the likely m31 flux .",
    "we then calculated the likely signal from other parts of the milky way halo .",
    "we performed an off - centre analysis in which we take a series of 5000 sightlines @xmath18 away from the main halo centre .",
    "we obtain a flux distribution that is slightly in tension with the 95 per cent exclusion limit from the @xcite blank sky dataset .",
    "pairs of gc and m31 measurements were compared to the ratio of fluxes found by @xcite , and were found to be in good agreement for a wide range of sampling procedures .    finally , we repeated the procedure for the draco and sculptor dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies .",
    "we find a wide range of possible probability curves , with the central halo density as a very important parameter .",
    "our results in this regime are consistent with a non - detection reported using @xmath19ks of archival _ xmm - newton _ data , and future pointings of draco will have the ability to rule out a dark matter decay signal from this object for values of @xmath20 at 95 per cent confidence .",
    "we would like to thank dima iakubovskiy and jeroen franse for reading the manuscript and for collaboration on x - ray data analysis and on estimates of sensitivity of future observations .",
    "we would also like to thank christoph weniger for useful comments .",

    "we discuss here the convergence with numerical resolution of our simulations . in figure  [ figsurfacedens ]",

    "the separation between all four simulations is minimal and therefore we can consider even our level 4 simulation to resolve the system accurately . at smaller radii",
    "the curves start to diverge systematically with resolution .",
    "the flux amplitude at the gc distance is suppressed by 70 per cent in aq - a4 relative to aq - a1 , compared to a difference in particle mass between the two runs of over two orders of magnitude .",

    "* ) with the same @xmath22 and @xmath23 as our aq - a1 halo ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) for distances between 7  kpc and 500  kpc .",
    "it predicts approximately 22 per cent more flux than our aq - a1 halo .",
    "however , @xcite found that the aquarius haloes were better described by an einasto profile @xcite than by an nfw .",
    "the einasto profile has a shallower central slope compared to the nfw , so the nfw curve may be interpreted as an upper limit on the ` true ' flux .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that a simulation of infinite resolution would return an gc flux more than @xmath26 per cent higher than that found in aq - a1 .",
    "a more demanding criterion for convergence is that our sightline measurements converge . in figure  [ figslconv ]",
    "we plot the distribution of fluxes for the gc and m31 for different resolution simulations of the aq - a halo .",
    "the peak in the gc distribution moves to higher fluxes with increasing resolution , since the addition of more particles to the simulation increases the mass contained within the fov on small scales .",
    "the distribution of the second highest resolution  aq - a2  is suppressed relative to that of the highest by 20 per cent , which is comparable to the suppression between these two simulations in figure  [ figsurfacedens ] .",
    "interestingly , the shape and width of the distribution changes very little between runs aq - a2 and aq - a1 , which suggests that our derived bounds relative to the distribution peak for the fluxes will not be affected by resolution as much as the amplitude .    as was the case for the spherically - averaged method ,",
    "the convergence of the m31 measurement is much better .",
    "the aq - a1 , aq - a2 , and aq - a3 distributions all peak at the same flux and have very similar shapes .",
    "this is due to the physical radius of the fov at the target in configuration space ( 740pc ) being much larger than the spatial resolution of the simulation , unlike the gc case ( only 8pc ) .    finally , we checked that 5000 sightlines measurements are sufficient for the convergence of the flux distribution functions and adopt this number throughout .",
    "in this section we examine the impact of various factors on our estimations of the fluxes from the gc and m31 , including the possible effects of our choice of cosmological parameters , warm dark matter power spectra , baryons , and halo mass and concentration .",
    "first we consider the effect of cosmology .",
    "the halo properties will be sensitive to parameters such as the age of the universe and at what redshift the halo centres form . in figure  [ figslwmap ]",
    "we plot the cumulative flux functions of the _ wmap1 _ and _ wmap7 _ versions of aq - a2 . in the gc and m31",
    "regimes the _ wmap7 _ flux distribution is suppressed relative to _ wmap1 _ by up to 10 per cent .",
    "this occurs despite the increase in @xmath22 from _ wmap1 _ to _ wmap7 _ ; instead the halo becomes less concentrated .",
    "@xmath27 has a lower value in _",
    "wmap7 _ compared to _ wmap1 _",
    "( see table  [ tabsim ] ) , and this change delays the halo formation time to an epoch when the universe is less dense @xcite .",
    "any such discrepancy may be magnified artificially by resolution issues since the _ wmap7 _ run particle mass is slightly higher . in conclusion , it is likely that the choice of cosmological parameters will have a impact on the m31 and gc fluxes of not more than a few per cent .",
    "we now address the effect of changing the primordial matter power spectrum .",
    "one well - motivated candidate for decaying dark matter is a resonantly - produced sterile neutrino @xcite .",
    "a sterile neutrino with a mass of 7  kev has a non - negligible free - streaming length that erases small scale power in the early universe .",
    "the resulting matter power spectrum therefore possesses a cutoff similar to that of warm dark matter ( wdm ) .",
    "the position and slope of the cutoff is not uniquely determined by the sterile neutrino mass , as the sterile neutrino momentum distribution is modified in the presence of a lepton asymmetry , which is a relatively unconstrained parameter .",
    "the family of spectra for a sterile neutrino mass of 7  kev and an unconstrained lepton asymmetry has cutoffs in the range between those of a 2.0  kev and a 3.3  kev thermal wdm candidate ( * ? ? ?",

    "we plot the m31 sightlines measurement and the surface density flux as a function of radius for our _ wmap7 _ version of aq - a2 ( cdm ) and four wdm models ( see figure caption ) .",
    "the wdm flux distributions are suppressed relative to cdm for the m31 measurement by the order of a few per cent .",
    "the variation between wdm models is by comparison very small .",
    "the 1.5kev model is further suppressed than the 2.3kev , suggesting that flux correlates inversely with the free - streaming length , albeit weakly for this range of models .",
    "the discrepancy between cdm and the wdm models is reflected in the flux surface density profile , where cdm has a notably higher flux amplitude for observer distances greater than 40kpc . at the distance of m31",
    "this again amounts to a few per cent . at the gc observer distance",
    "the separation is much smaller and no longer correlates consistently with dark matter free - streaming length .",
    "this result is reflected in the sightlines distribution for the gc ( not shown ) .",
    "the 7kev sterile neutrinos will likely have a cooler power spectrum than that of even the 2.3kev thermal relic , therefore we do not consider further the effect of the dark matter free - streaming length on the flux distribution .",
    "one crucial component of the cosmological model that is missing from the simulations presented so far is baryonic physics . through the action of feedback and adiabatic",
    "contraction it is possible for baryons to alter considerably the distribution of dark matter and hence the expected x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "we have run realisations of aq - a4 ( _ wmap1 _ ) with two baryonic models .",
    "both make use of the star - formation and gas physics prescriptions introduced in @xcite ; one includes galactic winds and the other does not . with these simulations we are also able to relax the assumption that dm and baryons have the same spatial distribution .",
    "the m31 flux distribution functions for these simulations along with that of dark matter - only aq - a4 are plotted in figure  [ figslba ] .",
    "the variation in flux distributions is substantial . both baryon model simulations exhibit m31-distance flux distributions that are @xmath28 per cent higher than that of the dm - only run .",
    "alternative gas / star - formation physics and subgrid recipes may produce different results : here we simply state that the precise effect of gas physics is uncertain and likely to effect the outcome of our measurement for m31 . due to the poor resolution of the gc measurement in aq - a4",
    "we do not attempt to draw conclusions about the likely effect of baryons on the gc results",
    ".      the measured flux will be very sensitive to the concentration of both the mw and m31 haloes , which decreases with halo mass albeit with considerable scatter @xcite .",
    "also , individual haloes will have very stochastic formation histories , and so will likely have very different structures .",
    "we therefore use four further aquarius haloes ( b - e ) to examine the scatter in flux measurements that is likely to result from these variations in halo properties . in figure  [ figslabcde ] we plot the gc and m31 flux distributions for aq - a2 plus these extra four haloes , also simulated at resolution level 2 .    the gc flux distribution of the aq - c2 halo is enhanced by over a factor of two relative to aq - b2 ( the least massive halo ) .",
    "it is also a factor of two larger than is the case for aq - d2 , which is remarkable in that the aq - d2 and aq - c2 haloes have the same mass to at least three significant figures .",
    "the underlying difference is halo concentration : the value of the concentration parameter @xmath23 is 18.4 for aq - c2 and 12.4 for aq - d2 .",
    "the difference between haloes is even larger for the m31 case : therefore , the variation in halo concentration between our haloes will be very important for our results .",
    "the final effect that we consider is that of the position of the observer within the milky way halo .",
    "it has been shown that the stellar disc is at its most stable when aligned with the inner dark matter halo s minor axis @xcite , and that the orientation of these vectors is constant from the inner resolution limit to @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we therefore calculate the inertia tensor of all the dark matter particles within the sphere of radius @xmath30 , extract the minor axis vector for the corresponding ellipsoid , and then randomly distribute observers in rings of radius 8kpc with the minor axis as the normal vector .",
    "we plot the distribution functions in figure  [ figslaxes ] ; for completeness we also include the results when the intermediate and major axes are used as the normal vector .",
    "the simulation used is aq - a1 .",
    "the different axes have a noticeable effect on the distribution of fluxes .",
    "the shapes of the constrained - observer curves have quite different shapes to the the spherical - sampling case .",
    "for the major axis measurement the distribution at low fluxes is remarkably similar to the spherical case , but is then skewed heavily towards higher fluxes .",
    "the minor axis has consistently higher fluxes than does spherical sampling , by up to a few tens of per cent .",
    "given that the effect is non - negligible , we will therefore build the possiblity that our observer is biased towards the minor plane axis into our final results ."
