    "history of weak interaction physics has to a large extent been a history of our understanding of the properties of the elusive spin half particles called the neutrinos .",
    "evidence for only lefthanded neutrinos being emitted in beta decay was the cornerstone of the successful v - a theory of weak interactions suggested by sudarshan , marshak , feynman and gell - mann ; evidence for the neutral current interactions in early seventies provided brilliant confirmation of the successful gauge unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions proposed by glashow , salam and weinberg .    today",
    "as we enter a new millenium , we again have evidence for a very important new property of the neutrinos i.e. they have mass and as a result like the quarks , they mix with each other and lead to the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation .",
    "this is contrary to the expectations based on the standard model as well as the old v - a theory ( in fact one may recall that one way to make the v - a theory plausible was to use invariance of the weak lagrangian under the so called @xmath0 invariance of all fermions , a principle which was motivated by the assumption that neutrinos have zero mass ) .",
    "the simple fact that neutrino masses vanish in the standard model is proof that its nonzero mass is an indication of new physics at some higher scale ( or shorter distances ) .",
    "study of details of neutrino masses and mixings is therefore going to open up new vistas in our journey towards a deeper understanding of the properties of the weak interactions at very short distances .",
    "this no doubt will have profound implications for the nature of the final theory of the particles , forces and the universe .",
    "we are of course far from a complete picture of the masses and mixings of the various neutrinos and can not therefore have a full outline of the theory that explains them .",
    "however there exist enough information and indirect indications that constrain the masses and mixings among the neutrinos that we can see a narrowing of the possibilities for the theories .",
    "many clever experiments now under way will soon clarify or rule out many of the allowed models .",
    "it will be one of the goals of this article to give a panoramic view of the most likely scenarios for new physics that explain what is now known about neutrino masses@xcite .",
    "we hope to emphasize the several interesting ideas for understanding the small neutrino masses and discuss in general terms how they can lead to scenarios for neutrinos currently being discussed in order to understand the observations .",
    "these ideas have a very good chance of being part of the final theory of neutrino masses .",
    "we then touch briefly on some specific models that are based on the above general framework but attempt to provide an understanding of the detailed mass and mixing patterns .",
    "these works are instructive for several reasons : first they provide proof of the detailed workability of the general ideas described above ( sort of existence proofs that things will work ) ; second they often illustrate the kind of assumptions needed and through that a unique insight into which directions the next step should be ; finally of course nature may be generous in picking one of those models as the final message bearer .",
    "the electron and the neutrino are in many ways very similar particles : they are both spin half objects ; they both participate in weak interactions with same strength ; in fact they are so similar that in the limit of exact gauge symmetries they are two states of the same object and therefore in principle indistinguishable .",
    "yet there are profound differences between them in the standard model : after gauge symmetry breaking , only electron has electric charge .",
    "another difference is that only the lefthanded neutrino is included in the standard model and not its righthanded counterpart ; this is unlike the electron both whose helicity states are included .",
    "in fact it is this property of the standard model coupled with @xmath1 being an exact symmetry which leads to neutrino remaining massless to all orders in perturbation theory as well as after the inclusion of nonperturbative effects .",
    "the fact that the neutrino has no electric charge endows it with certain properties not shared by other fermions of the standard model such as the quarks and the electron ( all of whom are electrically charged ) .",
    "the point is that for neutral fermions one can write two kinds of lorentz invariant mass terms , the dirac and majorana masses , whereas for the charged fermions , conservation of electric charge allows only the dirac type mass terms . in the four component notation for the fermions ,",
    "the dirac mass has the form @xmath2 , whereas the majorana mass is of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the four component spinor and @xmath5 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "one can also discuss the two different kinds of mass terms using the two component notation for the spinors .",
    "if we denote by @xmath6 and @xmath7 the two two - component spinors which make up the four component object @xmath4 , then a dirac mass is @xmath8 whereas a majorana mass is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the pauli matrices . to make correspondence with the four component notation , we point out that @xmath6 and @xmath11 are nothing but the @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath6 and @xmath7 have opposite electric charges ; therefore the dirac mass @xmath8 maintains electric charge conservation ( as well as any other kind of charge like lepton number etc . ) .",
    "this richness in the possibility for neutrino masses also has a down side in the sense that in general , there are more parameters describing the masses of the neutrinos than those for the quarks and leptons .",
    "for instance for the electron and quarks , dynamics ( electric charge conservation ) reduces the number of parameters in their mass matrix . as an example , using the two component notation for all fermions , for the case of two two component spinors , a charged fermion mass will be described only by one parameters whereas for a neutrino , there will be three parameters .",
    "this difference inceases rapidly e.g. for 2n spinors , to describe charged fermion masses , we need @xmath14 parameters ( ignoring cp violation ) whereas for neutrinos , we need @xmath15 parameters .",
    "what is more interesting is that for a neutrino like particle , one can have both even and odd number of two component objects and have a consistent theory .",
    "there are suggestions that if there are an odd number of two component charged spinors , the corresponding theory is not consistent as a perturbative field theory .    in this article",
    ", we will use two component notation for neutrinos .",
    "thus when we say that there are n neutrinos , we will mean n two - component neutrinos .    in the two component language ,",
    "all massive neutrinos are majorana particles and what is conventionally called a dirac neutrino is really a very specific choice of mass parameters for the majorana neutrino .",
    "let us give some examples : if there is only one two component neutrino ( we will drop the prefix two component henceforth ) , it can have a mass @xmath16(to be called @xmath17 in shorthanded notation ) .",
    "the neutrino is now a self conjugate object which can be seen if we write an equivalent 4-component spinor @xmath4 : @xmath18 note that this 4-component spinor satisfies the condition @xmath19 this condition implies that the neutrino is its own anti - particle , a fact more transparent in the 4- rather than the two - component notation .",
    "the above exercise illustrates an important point i.e. given any two component spinor , one can always write a self conjugate ( or majorana ) 4-component spinor . whether a particle is really its own antiparticle or not is therefore determined by its interactions . to see this for the electrons ,",
    "one may solve the following excercise i.e. if we wrote two majorana spinors using the two two component spinors that describe the charged fermion ( electron ) , then until we turn on the electromagnetic interactions and the mass term , we will not know whether the electron is its own antiparticle or not .",
    "once we turn on the electromagnetism , this ambiguity is resolved .",
    "let us now go one step further and consider two 2-component neutrinos ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the general mass matrix for this case is given by : @xmath21 note first that this is a symmetric matrix and can be diagonalized by orthogonal transformations .",
    "the eigenstates which will be certain admixtures of the original neutrinos now describe self conjugate particles .",
    "one can look at some special cases :    _ : _    if we have @xmath22 and @xmath23 , then one can assign a charge + 1 to @xmath24 and -1 to @xmath25 and the theory has an extra @xmath26 symmetry which can be identified as the lepton number and the particle is then called a dirac neutrino . the point to be noted",
    "is that the dirac neutrino is a special case of for two majorana neutrinos .",
    "in fact if we insisted on calling this case one with two majorana neutrinos , then the two will have equal and opposite ( in sign ) mass as can be seen diagonalizing the above mass matrix .",
    "thus a dirac neutrino can be thought of as two majorana neutrinos with equal and opposite ( in sign ) masses . since the argument of a complex mass term in general refers to its c transformation property ( i.e. @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the phase of the complex mass term ) , the two two component fields of a dirac neutrino have opposite charge conjugation properties .    _ : _",
    "if we have @xmath29 , this case is called pseudo - dirac neutrino since this is a slight departure from case ( i ) . in reality , in this case also the neutrinos are majorana neutrinos with their masses @xmath30 with @xmath31 . the two component neutrinos will be maximally mixed .",
    "thus this case is of great current physical interest in view of the atmospheric ( and perhaps solar ) neutrino data .    _ : _    there is third case where one may have @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in this case",
    "the eigenvalues of the neutrino mass matrix are given respectively by : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "one may wonder under what conditions such a situation may arise in a realistic gauge model .",
    "it turns out that if @xmath24 transforms as an @xmath36 doublet and @xmath25 is an @xmath36 singlet , then the value of @xmath37 is limited by the weak scale whereas @xmath38 has no suchlimit and @xmath32 if the theory has no @xmath36 triplet field ( as for instance is the case in the standard model ) .",
    "choosing @xmath39 then provides a natural way to understand the smallness of the neutrino masses .",
    "this is known as the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "since this case is very different from the case ( i ) and ( ii ) , it is generally said that in grand unified theories , one expects the neutrinos to be majorana particles .",
    "the reason is that in most grand unified theories there is a higher scale which under appropriate situations provides a natural home for the large mass @xmath38 .",
    "while we have so far used only two neutrinos to exemplify the various cases including the seesaw mechanism , these discussions generalize when @xmath40 are each @xmath41 matrices ( which we denote by @xmath42 ) . for example , the seesaw formula for this general situation can be written as @xmath43 where the subscripts @xmath44 and @xmath45 are used in anticipation of their origin in gauge theories where @xmath46 turns out to be the dirac matrix and @xmath47 is the mass matrix of the right handed neutrinos and all eigenvalues of @xmath47 are much larger than the elements of @xmath46 .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that eq .",
    "( 4 ) can be written in a more general form where the dirac matrices are not necessarily square matrices but @xmath48 matrices with @xmath49 .",
    "we give such examples below .",
    "although there is no experimental proof that the neutrino is a majorana particle , the general opinion is that the the seesaw mechanism provides such a simple way to understand the glaring differences between the masses of the neutrinos and the charged fermions that neutrinos indeed must be majorana particles .",
    "even though for most situations , the neutrino can be treated as a two component object regardless of whether its mass is of dirac or majorana type , there are certain practical situations where differences between the majorana and dirac neutrino becomes explicit : one case is when the two neutrinos annihilate . for dirac neutrinos ,",
    "the particle and the antiparticle are distinct and therefore there annihilation is not restricted by pauli principle in any manner .",
    "however , for the case of majorana neutrinos , the identity of neutrinos and antineutrinos plays an important role and one finds that the annihilation to the z - bosons occurs only via the p - waves . similarly in the decay of the neutrino to any final state , the decay rate for the majorana neutrino is a factor of two higher than for the dirac neutrino .",
    "as has been extensively discussed elsewhere in this book , while the direct search experiments for neutrino masses using tritium beta decay and neutrinoless double beta decay have only yielded upper limits , the searches for neutrino oscillation , which can occur only if the neutrinos have masses and mixings have yielded positive evidences .",
    "there is now clear evidence from one and strong indications from other experiments for neutrino oscillations and hence neutrino masses .",
    "the evidence comes from the atmospheric neutrino data in the super - kamiokande experiment@xcite which confirms the indications of oscillations in earlier data from the kamiokande@xcite , imb@xcite experiments .",
    "more recent data from soudan ii@xcite and macro@xcite experiments provide further confirmation of this evidence .",
    "the observation here is the following : in the standard model with massless neutrinos , all the muon and electron neutrinos produced at the top of the atmosphere would be expected to reach detectors on the earth and would be isotropic ; what has been observed is that while that is true for the electron neutrinos , the muon neutrino flux observed on earth exhibit a strong zenith angle dependence . a simple way to understand",
    "this would be to assume that the muon neutrinos oscillate into another undetected species of neutrino on their way to the earth , with a characteristic oscillation length of order of ten thousand kilometers . since the oscillation length is roughly given by @xmath50 kilometers , for a gev neutrino",
    ", one would expect the particle physics parameter @xmath51 corresponding to the mass difference between the two neutrinos to be around @xmath52 ev@xmath53 corresponding to maximal mixing .    from the existing data several important conclusions can be drawn : ( i ) the data can not be fit assuming oscillation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 ; ( ii ) two oscillation scenarios that fit the data are @xmath56 as well as @xmath57 oscillations ( where @xmath58 is a sterile neutrino that does not couple to the w or the z bosons in the basic lagrangian ) , although at the two @xmath59 level , the first scenario is a better fit than the latter .",
    "the more precise values of the oscillation parameters at 90% c.l .",
    "are : @xmath60    the second evidence for neutrino oscillation comes from the five experiments that have observed a deficit in the flux of neutrinos from the sun as compared to the predictions of the standard solar model championed by bahcall and his collaborators@xcite and more recently studied by many groups .",
    "the experiments resposible for this discovery are the chlorine , kamiokande , gallex , sage and super - kamiokande@xcite experiments conducted at the homestake mine , kamioka in japan , gran sasso in italy and baksan in russia .",
    "the different experiments see different parts of the solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "the details of these considerations are discussed in other chapters .",
    "the oscillation interpretation of the solar neutrino deficit has more facets to it than the atmospheric case : first the final state particle that the @xmath55 oscillates into and second what kind of @xmath51 and mixings fit the data . at the moment",
    "there is a multitude of possibilities .",
    "let us summarize them now .",
    "as far as the final state goes , it can either be one of the two remaining active neutrinos , @xmath61 and @xmath62 or it can be the sterile neutrino @xmath58 as in the case of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "both possibilities are open at the moment .",
    "the sno experiment which is expected to measure the solar neutrino flux via neutral current interactions will settle the issue of whether the final state of solar neutrino oscillation is the active neutrino or the sterile neutrino ; in the former case , the ratio @xmath63 of charged current flux ( @xmath64 ) to the neutral current flux ( @xmath65 ) is nearly half whereas in the latter case , it is one . as far as the @xmath51 and @xmath66 parameters go , there are three possibilities : if the oscillation proceeds without any help from the matter in the dense core of the sun , it is called vacuum oscillation ( vo ) ; if oscillation is enhanced by the solar core , it is called the msw mechanism , in which case there are two ranges of parameters that can explain the deficit- the small angle ( sma - msw ) and the large angle ( lma - msw ) . the parameter ranges , taken from ref.@xcite are : @xmath67 relevant point to note is that there is no large angle msw fit for the case of sterile neutrinos due to absence of matter effect for them .",
    "the situation lately however has been quite fluid in the sense that there are measurements from the super - kamiokande experiment of the electron energy distribution which appears to contradict the msw - sma solution ; similarly there are day night effects which seem to prefer msw - lma solution although vo solutions also lead to day night effects due to matter effects for certain ranges of @xmath51@xcite",
    ". there are also indications of seasonal variation of the solar neutrino flux above and beyond that expected from the position of the earth in the orbit .",
    "finally , we come to the last indication of neutrino oscillation from the los alamos liquid scintillation detector ( lsnd ) experiment@xcite , where neutrino oscillations of @xmath54 both from a stopped muon decay ( dar ) as well as the one accompanying the muon in pion decay ( dif ) have been observed .",
    "the evidence from the dar is statistically more significant and is an oscillation from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "the mass and mixing parameter range that fits data is : @xmath70 there are also points at higher masses specifically at 6 ev@xmath53 which are allowed by the present lsnd data for small mixings@xcite .",
    "presently karmen experiment at the rutherford laboratory is also searching for the same oscillation . while they have found about eight events as of this writing ,",
    "this is consistent with their expected background@xcite .",
    "the proposed miniboone experiment fermilab@xcite will provide more definitive information on this very important process in the next five years .",
    "our goal now is to study the theoretical implications of these discoveries",
    ". we will proceed towards this goal in the following manner : we will isolate the mass patterns that fit the above data and then look for plausible models that can first lead to the general feature that neutrinos have tiny masses ; then we would try to understand in simple manner some of the features indicated by data in the hope that these general ideas will be part of our final understanding of the neutrino masses . as mentioned earlier on , to understand the neutrino masses one has to go beyond the standard model .",
    "first we will sharpen what we mean by this statement .",
    "then we will present some ideas which may form the basic framework for constructing the detailed models .",
    "we will refrain from discussing any specific models except perhaps giving examples by way of illustrating the theoretical ideas .",
    "as already mentioned , we will assume two component neutrinos and therefore their masses will in general be majorana type .",
    "let us also give our notation to facilitate further discussion : the neutrinos emitted in weak processes such as the beta decay or muon decay are weak eigenstates and are not mass eigenstates .",
    "the latter determines how a neutrino state evolves in time .",
    "similarly , in the detection process , it is the weak eigenstate that is picked out .",
    "this is of course the key idea behind neutrino oscillation@xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to express the weak eigenstates in terms of the mass eigenstates .",
    "we will denote the weak eigenstate by the symbol @xmath71 or simply @xmath72 etc whereas the mass eigenstate will be denoted by the symbols @xmath73 etc .",
    "the mixing angles will be denoted by @xmath74 and relate the two sets of eigenstates as follows : @xmath75 using this equation , one can derive the wellknown oscillation formulae for the survival probability of a particular weak eigenstate @xmath76 to be : @xmath77 where @xmath78 . the transition probability from one weak eigenstate to another is given by @xmath79    since majorana masses violate lepton number , a very important constraint on any discussion of neutrino mass patterns arises from the negative searches for neutrinoless double beta decay@xcite .",
    "the most stringent present limits are obtained from the heidelberg - moscow enriched germanium-76 experiment at gran sasso and implies an upper limit on the following combination of masses and mixings : @xmath80 this upper limit depends on the nuclear matrix element calculated by the heidelberg group@xcite",
    ". there could be an uncertainty of a factor of two to three in this estimate .",
    "this would then relax the above upper bound to at most 0.6 ev .",
    "this is a very stringent limit and becomes especially relevant when one considers whether the neutrinos constitute a significant fraction of the hot dark matter of the universe .",
    "a useful working formula is @xmath81 ev where @xmath82 is the neutrino fraction that contributes to the dark matter of the universe .",
    "for instance , if the dark matter fraction is 20% , then the sum total of neutrino masses must be 4.8 ev .",
    "the situation at the moment is uncertain@xcite after the results from the high z supernova searches indicated possible nonzero cosmological constant",
    ". nevertheless , from structure formation data , a total neutrino mass of 2 - 3 ev can not strictly be ruled out and in fact one particular fit@xcite prefers a cold+hot dark matter with a similar mass as a better fit than any other ( e.g. cdm+@xmath83 ) .",
    "the proposed genius@xcite experiment by the heidelberg - moscpw collaboration has the promise to bring down the upper limit on @xmath84 by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this would profoundly effect the current ideas on neutrino masses and will help to more sharply define the theoretical directions in the field .    in view of several levels of uncertainties that currently surround the various pieces of information on neutrino masses",
    ", we will consider different scenarios .",
    "it is not an unfair reflection of the present community consensus to say that the solar and the atmospheric neutrino results are the most secure evidences for neutrino masses .",
    "we will therefore first consider the implications of taking these two sets of data seriously supplemented by the very useful information from neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "we will include the lsnd data subsequently .",
    "if one wants to fit only the solar and atmospheric neutrino data , regardless of the nature of the solution to the solar neutrino puzzle ( i.e. msw small or large angle or vacuum oscillation ) , it is possible to have consistent scenarios using only the three known neutrinos .",
    "there are many mixing patterns and neutrino mass matrices that can be used for the purpose . in discussing these patterns ,",
    "it is important to remember that a solution to the atmospheric neutrino puzzle requires that in the context of a three neutrino model , @xmath54 and @xmath62 must mix maximally .",
    "there are two interesting mass patterns that have been widely discussed in literature : ( i ) hierarchical pattern with @xmath85 or ( ii ) approximately degenerate pattern @xcite @xmath86 , where @xmath87 are the eigenvalues of the neutrino mass matrix . in the first case , the atmospheric and the solar neutrino data give direct information on @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively . on the other hand , in the second case",
    ", the mass differences between the first and the second eigenvalues are chosen to fit the solar neutrino data and the second and the third to fit the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay limits imply very stringent constraints on the mixing pattern in the degenerate case ; but before we proceed to this discussion let us focus for a while on the hierarchical mass pattern .    in proceeding with this discussion",
    "it is important to remember that the chooz reactor data@xcite implies that for @xmath88 ev@xmath53 , the electron neutrino mixing angle has a rough upper bound @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore it is now certain that atmospheric neutrino data can not be fitted by @xmath90 oscillation .",
    "together they imply that in any neutrino mass matrix construction , one must require that @xmath91@xcite .",
    "note that @xmath92 can be larger since the relevant @xmath51 which corresponds to the solar neutrino puzzle is lower than what the chooz experiment is sensitive to .",
    "on the other hand the solar neutrino admits both small and large mixing angles . combining these two inputs",
    ", one can conclude that the @xmath93 neutrino mixing matrix is given by@xcite @xmath94 in writing the above mixing matrix , we have assumed atmospheric neutrino data fit with @xmath95 . on the other hand if we took , this value to be @xmath96 , the above mixing matrix changes to : @xmath97",
    "there are two special cases , where these mixing matrices take specially appealing forms : case ( a ) : if maximal mixing solutions are chosen for the solar neutrino puzzle or case(b ) : it is assumed that the neutrino masses are degenerate with a mass @xmath98 such that the effective mass deduced from neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath99@xcite .",
    "in either case , the first matrix reduces to the so called bimaximal form@xcite whereas the second matrix reduces to the democratic form@xcite .",
    "the mixing matrices are obtained from the above two equations by taking @xmath100 .",
    "the neutrino mass matrices in both these cases can be obtained by writing @xmath101 where @xmath102 .    *",
    ":*    the most compelling physical motivation for this case comes from the requirement that neutrinos constitute a significant fraction of the dark matter of the universe .",
    "using our previous discussion , we see that if the neutrino hdm constitutes about 20% of the critical mass of the universe , then the total neutrino mass i.e. @xmath103 must be about 4.8 ev . if all three neutrinos are degenerate the share of each species is 1.6 ev .",
    "note that this is much bigger than the present upper limits on the effective mass @xmath84 from neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "if we ignore cp phases , then this implies a strong constraint on the mixings .",
    "two particularly interesting mass matrices emerge , for the case where the neutrino masses are approximately degenerate . to derive them ,",
    "let us choose @xmath104 .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath105 , then we conclude that the mixing matrix elements @xmath106 .",
    "it therefore follows that the small angle msw solution is automatically eliminated . for the bimaximal case",
    ", one gets the neutrino mass matrix of the form@xcite : @xmath107 for derivation of this mass matrix in gauge models , see ref.@xcite .",
    "there is a corresponding mass matrix for the democratic case : it is given by @xmath108    finally we want to note the form of the neutrino mass matrices that lead in general case to mixing matrices which have either the democratic or the bimaximal form regardless of the nature of the eigenvalues .",
    "the importance of this discussion is that in trying to construct gauge models for neutrinos , the mass matrix follows directly from the lagrangian and the mixing follows from this afterwards .    _",
    "( i ) bimaximal case _",
    "@xmath109    note that vanishing of neutrinoless double beta decay implies that @xmath110 .",
    "a special case of this is when @xmath111 .",
    "such mass matrices have been discussed in literature for the three neutrino case in ref.@xcite and for construction of gauge models for this casee , see @xcite .    _",
    "( ii ) democratic case : _    this case is more complicated .",
    "as was noted in ref.@xcite one must choose the charged lepton mass matrix in the form while keeping the neutrino mass matrix diagonal . :",
    "@xmath112 the symmetric form of the matrix in the democratic case is clear and in fact it exhibits a permutation symmetry @xmath113 operating on the lepton doublets , which provides another clue to possible gauge model building .    *",
    ":*    one can also get some clue to model building by analysing the case where the neutrino masses are hierarchical i.e. @xmath114 . to see this",
    "let us first ignore the couplings of the first generation and consider only the @xmath115 mass matrix involving the second and the third generation .",
    "it has been pointed out that@xcite , one very simple way to get a natural hierarchy while having a maximal ( or large ) mixing is to have a matrix @xmath116 of rank one i.e. @xmath117 this matrix has one zero eigenvalue whereas choosing @xmath118 leads to large mixing angle .",
    "further interest in this idea emerges from the observation that such an @xmath116 can arise via the seesaw mechanism if one chooses @xmath119 .",
    "the interesting point about this form for @xmath46 is that if we define it as @xmath120 ( with @xmath121 are column vectors ) , the above form for @xmath46 only mixes the right handed neutrinos and not the left handed ones . in a quark lepton unified model",
    "this would mean that only right handed quarks mix with a large mixing angle .",
    "this of course is completely unconstrained by observations that confirm the standard model since there are no righthanded charged currents in the standard model . more importantly",
    ", it leaves the left handed mixing small .",
    "thus this observation may provide one reconciliation of the apparent conundrum that the quark mixing angles are small whereas the neutrino mixng angles are large .",
    "this particular form has the disadvantege that it can not arise in models such as left - right models which generally lead to symmetric dirac masses .",
    "there are also other ways to generate maximal mixing angles .",
    "for instance a choice for neutrino mass matrix ( for the 2 - 3 sector ) of the form @xmath122 leads to maximal mixing .",
    "these mass matrices respect permutation symmetries ( e.g. @xmath113 ) and therefore can be stable under radiative corrections .",
    "ref.@xcite has discussed the stability of neutrino mass matrices with respect to small variations of the parameters for various neutrino mass hierarchies .      in order to explain solar , atmospheric and the lsnd data simultaneously using the oscillation picture",
    ", one must invoke additional neutrinos since the different @xmath51s needed to explain each piece of data is very different from the others and would never add up to zero as would be the case if there were only three neutrino species i.e. @xmath123 .",
    "this is a revolutionary result since lep and slc measurements imply precisely ( within very small errors ) that there are almost precisely three active neutrinos coupling to the z - boson ( the actual lep result is @xmath124@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , even though the conclusions from big bang nucleosynthesis@xcite are not as precise as the lep - slc data , the helium abundance is very sensitive to the number of neutrinos and anywhere from 3.2 to 4.4 total number of neutrinos could be accomodated .",
    "already these two results imply strong constraints on the theories that include extra neutrinos beyond those present in the standard model .",
    "for instance , the lep - slc data data implies that the extra neutrinos can not couple to the z - boson with the same strength as other neutrinos .",
    "they have therefore been designated in the literature as sterile neutrinos .",
    "their `` sterility '' also helps them to evade the bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis as follows .",
    "suppose , the coupling of a sterile neutrino to known leptons is given by the four fermi interaction with a strength given by @xmath125 .",
    "then , if @xmath126@xcite , then the sterile neutrinos decouple before the qcd phase transition temperature of about a 100 mev and their effective contribution at the bbn era becomes equivalent to about @xmath127 neutrino species .",

    "typically , the constraint is @xmath128 these considerations are important in constructing detailed theories of the sterile neutrinos .",
    "while we postpone the detailed discussion of theories with extra neutrinos to a separate section , here we wish to study the possible four or more neutrino patterns and their mass matrices that correspond to the exsting neutrino data .    _",
    "_    it is possible to construct three possible scenarios for neutrino data using the four neutrinos . denoting the sterile neutrino by @xmath58 ,",
    "the three scenarios are the following :    _ _    the solar neutrino data is solved via the msw small angle oscillation between the @xmath129 , which then have a mass difference of @xmath130 ev@xmath53 whereas the atmospheric neutrino data is solved via the @xmath56 oscillation@xcite .",
    "( of course , the solar neutrino puzzle could also be solved via the vacuum oscillation of @xmath129 . ) in either case , if we have @xmath131 ev , then there can be a significant hot dark matter component in the universe with enormous implications for structure formation .",
    "note that lsnd data is then fitted by @xmath90 oscillation with the @xmath132 being determined by @xmath133 .",
    "it is interesting that the present lsnd data has a considerable range where the neutrinos contribute significantly to the hdm component of the universe .    _",
    "_    it is also possible to have a scenario where the atmospheric neutrino data is fitted by the @xmath57 maximal oscillation whereas the solar neutrino data is fitted by the @xmath134 oscillation .",
    "again as before , the @xmath133 determines the splitting between the two pairs of levels and will determine the hot dark matter content of the universe . in a series of papers , bilenky et al have extensively studied the tests of these models@xcite .",
    "it is possible to experimentally distinguish between these two scenarios .",
    "the @xmath129 oscillation solution to the solar neutrino puzzle can be tested once sno experiment measures the neutral current flux of the solar neutrinos since the @xmath58 s do not have any neutral current interaction as opposed to the @xmath135 .",
    "similarly , in the atmospheric neutrino data search for neutral current events with pion production @xmath136 can discriminate between the oscillation of the atmospheric @xmath54 s to @xmath62 s against @xmath58s@xcite .",
    "the present data appears to favor at the two @xmath59 level@xcite the oscillation to @xmath62 s but can not be taken as a conclusive proof .",
    "_ : _    another possibility is to have the three active neutrinos bunched together with very minute mass differences such that @xmath137 oscillation explains the solar neutrino data and the @xmath56 oscillation explains the atmospheric puzzle .",
    "the lsnd data can then be explained by including a sterile neutrino ( or three of them ) which is separated in mass from the three known neutrinos by an amount @xmath138 and using indirect oscillation between the @xmath137 via the sterile neutrino state@xcite .",
    "it has however been recently pointed out that this possibility may be marginally inconsistent with the observed up - down asymmetry in atmospheric neutrino data when combined with the cdhs and bugey limits@xcite .",
    "let us study possible mass textures for four neutrinos .",
    "the general mass matrix in this case is a @xmath139 symmetric matrix which has 10 nonzero entries if cp conservation is assumed .",
    "an interesting question to explore is : what the minimum number of parameters that are necessary to fit observations .",
    "this would then isolate useful mass matrices with specific textures which may then lead to clues to their theoretical origin . for this purpose",
    "let us do a bit of parameter counting .",
    "if the solar neutrino puzzle is assumed to be solved by the small angle msw mechanism , then there must be at least five parameters in the @xmath139 symmetric neutrino mass matrix : three corresponding to @xmath140 and two small mixings @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( where @xmath143 denote respectively the solar , atmospheric and lsnd experiments ) .",
    "if on the other hand the solar neutrino puzzle is solved via the vacuum oscillation mechanism , then one parameter is eliminated and one can make do with four parameters .",
    "finally , if one adopts either the large angle msw ( between @xmath55 and @xmath58 ) for solar neutrinos or the @xmath57 alternative is used to solve the atmospheric neutrino puzzle , then we have the additional relation between parameters i.e. @xmath144 this reduces the number of parameters to three .",
    "an example of this type has recently been provided in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us start with the simplest case with three parameters@xcite .",
    "( here we have used the basis @xmath145 .",
    "it could be easily reshuffled to consider the @xmath57 oscillation possibility for atmospheric neutrinos . )",
    "@xmath146 here @xmath147 is the solar mass splitting and @xmath148 is the atmospheric mass splitting .",
    "the next simplest case seems to involve only four parameters and has the following form@xcite : @xmath149 where we choose @xmath150 ev .",
    "however , since in this case the sterile neutrino has a smaller mass than the @xmath55 ( as can be seen by diagonalizing the above mass matrix ) , the solution to the solar neutrino puzzle must involve the vacuum oscillation of the @xmath55 to @xmath58 .",
    "this can therefore be clearly tested once sufficient solar neutrino data accumulates ( say for example from super - kamiokande and borexino ) in favor of or against the seasonal variation .",
    "going to one more parameter , we have the mass matrix which has one of the two following forms@xcite : @xmath151 in this case by an appropriate choice of @xmath152 , the sterile neutrino can be made heavier than the elctron neutrino . as a result",
    ", one can have useful msw transition between the @xmath55 and @xmath58 that can help to solve the solar neutrino puzzle via the small angle msw solution .",
    "this possibility has its characteristic predictions and it is expected that it can be tested in future colliders such as the muon collider . for discussion of cp violation in these models see ref.@xcite .    _",
    "_    one obvious question that arises as we consider sterile neutrino models is `` how many such neutrinos are there ? '' .",
    "symmetry would suggest that there are three sterile neutrinos rather than one .",
    "in fact there are models of this type in the literature@xcite . in one class of models , @xcite ,",
    "the additional neutrinos ( i.e. the fifth and the sixth ) do not play any role in describing neutrino observations ; but in the other two@xcite , they play an essential role .",
    "the profile of oscillation explanations in this case is very different and more symmetric in the sense that the both solar and atmospheric neutrino data are explained by maximal mixing angle vacuum oscillation between active and sterile neutrinos ( i.e. solar via @xmath153 and atmospheric via @xmath154 vacuum oscillations)@xcite ; the lsnd results in this case is explained via generational mixing which is small like all other charged fermion mixings .",
    "the physics of this scheme is different from the previous ones as are the experimental tests .",
    "we will discuss typical theories for such scenarios in subsequent sections .    before closing this section",
    ", it is worth pointing out that the introduction of the sterile neutrino is such a far reaching idea that attempts have been made to reconcile the lsnd data without invoking oscillations in which case solar and atmospheric neutrino puzzles as well as the lsnd data can be accomodated within the three standard neutrino framework .",
    "the idea is to look for consistent models where a sufficiently significant amplitude for the anomalous decay mode of muon @xmath155 exists without conflicting with other known data to explain the @xmath156 rate for the observed @xmath69 s .",
    "however it has been pointed out@xcite that the muonium to anti - muonium ( @xmath157 ) transition is related to the anomalous muon decay in several models ( such as left - right models or supersymmetric models with r - parity breaking ) in such a way that the existing experimental bounds from psi@xcite on @xmath157 transition suppresses the anomalous muon decay amplitude far below that required to explain the lsnd data . thus barring some really drastic new idea to explain the lsnd data as an anomalous muon decay",
    ", the confirmation of the lsnd data in future would require the existence of additional one or more sterile neutrinos decays , which have not been observed and therefore that mechanism is theoretically not very plausible . ] .",
    "it will then be dependent on the data as to which of the scenarios with extra sterile neutrinos will win in the end .",
    "as is wellknown , the standard model is based on the gauge group @xmath158 group under which the quarks and leptons transform as described in the table i.    the electroweak symmetry @xmath159 is broken by the vacuum expectation of the higgs doublet @xmath160 gev , which gives mass to the gauge bosons and the fermions , all fermions except the neutrino . thus the neutrino is massless in the standard model , at the tree level .",
    "there are several questions that arise at this stage .",
    "what happens when one goes beyond the above simple tree level approximation ?",
    "secondly , do nonperturbative effects change this tree level result ?",
    "finally , how will this result be modified when the quantum gravity effects are included ?",
    "* table i *    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table caption * assignment of the fermion and higgs fields to the representation of the left - right symmetry group .",
    "the first task is to specify how the left - right symmetry group breaks to the standard model i.e. how one breaks the @xmath161 symmetry so that the successes of the standard model including the observed predominant v - a structure of weak interactions at low energies is reproduced .",
    "another question of naturalness that also arises simultaneously is that since the charged fermions and the neutrinos are treated completely symmetrically ( quark - lepton symmetry ) in this model , how does one understand the smallness of the neutrino masses compared to that of the other fermions .",
    "it turns out that both the above problems of the lr model have a common solution .",
    "the process of spontaneous breaking of the @xmath162 symmetry that suppresses the v+a currents at low energies also solves the problem of ultralight neutrino masses . to see this",
    "let us write the higgs fields in terms of its components : @xmath163 all these higgs fields have yukawa couplings to the fermions given symbolically as below .",
    "@xmath164 the @xmath161 is broken down to the standard model hypercharge @xmath165 by choosing @xmath166 since this carries both @xmath162 and @xmath167 quantum numbers .",
    "it gives mass to the charged and neutral righthanded gauge bosons i.e. @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "thus by adjusting the value of @xmath170 one can suppress the right handed current effects in both neutral and charged current interactions arbitrarily leading to an effective near maximal left - handed form for the charged current weak interactions at low energies .",
    "the fact that at the same time the neutrino masses also become small can be seen by looking at the form of the yukawa couplings .",
    "note that the f - term leads to a mass for the right handed neutrinos only at the scale @xmath170 .",
    "next as we break the standard model symmetry by turning on the vev s for the @xmath7 fields as @xmath171 , we not only give masses to the @xmath172 and the @xmath173 bosons but also to the quarks and the leptons . in the neutrino sector the above yukawa couplings after @xmath36 breaking by @xmath174 lead to the dirac masses for the neutrino connecting the left and right handed neutrinos . in the two component neutrino language",
    ", this leads to the following mass matrix for the @xmath175 ( where we have denoted the left handed neutrino by @xmath176 and the right handed component by @xmath177 ) .",
    "@xmath178 by diagonalizing this @xmath115 matrix , we get the light neutrino eigenvalue to be @xmath179 and the heavy one to be @xmath180 .",
    "note that typical charged fermion masses are given by @xmath181 etc .",
    "so since @xmath182 , the light neutrino mass is automatically suppressed . this way of suppressing the neutrino masses is called the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "thus in one stroke , one explains the smallness of the neutrino mass as well as the suppression of the v+a currents .",
    "in deriving the above seesaw formula for neutrino masses , it has been assumed that the vev of the lefthanded triplet is zero so that the @xmath183 entry of the neutrino mass matrix is zero .",
    "however , in most explicit models such as the left - right model which provide an explicit derivation of this formula , there is an induced vev for the @xmath184 of order @xmath185 . in the presence of this term the seesaw formula undergoes a fundamental change .",
    "let us therefore distinguish between two types of seesaw formulae :    * *    @xmath186    where @xmath46 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix and @xmath187 is the right handed neutrino mass matrix in terms of the @xmath188 yukawa coupling matrix @xmath189 .",
    "* *    @xmath190    note that in the type i seesaw formula , what appears is the square of the dira neutrino mass matrix which in general expected to have the same hierarchical structure as the corresponding charged frermion mass matrix .",
    "in fact in some specific gut models such as so(10 ) , @xmath191 .",
    "this is the origin of the common statement that neutrino masses given by the seesaw formula are hierarchical i.e. @xmath192 and even a more model dependent statement that @xmath193 .    on the other hand",
    "if one uses the type ii seesaw formula , there is no reason to expect a hierarchy and in fact if the neutrino masses turn out to be degenerate as discussed before as one possibility , one way to understand this may be to use the type ii seesaw formula .    *",
    "*    while the above seesaw formulae are extremely helpful in building models with ultralight neutrino masses , there are circumstances where they are not helpful .",
    "an obvious example is one where the righthanded neutrino mass matrix is singular due to additional symmetries ( e.g. @xmath194 say ) , in which case its inverse does not exist and alternative ways to understand lightness of neutrinos must be explored .",
    "there is one such mechanism in literature which we will call type iii seesaw which involves a @xmath93 seesaw pattern@xcite rather than the just described @xmath115 one . for one generation ,",
    "it involves three fermions @xmath195 , where @xmath176 and @xmath177 are the usual left and right handed neutrinos and @xmath196 is a singlet neutrino ( singlet under the left - right group ) .",
    "the relevant seesaw matrix is given by @xmath197 we assume that @xmath198 in which case the three eigenvalues are given by @xmath199 its generalization to the case when each element is a matrix is obvious .",
    "the important point here is to note that the matrix @xmath200 is in the numerator . as a result , if we want the light neutrino mass matrix to be singular ( say @xmath194 invariant ) , then this can be built into the matrix @xmath200 and one can then use the seesaw formula given here to understand the smallness of the neutrino masses . in the context of left - right models this kind of a structure for neutrino masses",
    "arises if the triplets above are replaced by @xmath201 doublets and we supplement the model with one singlet fermion per generation .",
    "( _ show this by explicit construction and work out the example with @xmath194 symmetry _ ) .",
    "another feature of the type iii seesaw is that one could choose the b - l breaking scale to be much lower than in the case of the types i nd ii .",
    "let us now address the question : to what extent one can understand the details of the neutrino masses and mixings using the seesaw formulae .",
    "the answer to this question is quite model dependent . while one can say that there exist many models which fit the observations , none ( except a few ) are completely predictive .",
    "the problem in general is that the seesaw formula of type i has 12 parameters which is why its predictive power is so limited .",
    "one number that is predicted in a class of seesaw models based on the so(10 ) group that embodies the left - right symmetric unification model or the su(4)-color is the tau neutrino mass . in this class of models ,",
    "one maintains the quark lepton symmetry in the leading order so that one has the relation @xmath202 .",
    "the tau neutrino mass is then given by the seesaw formula to be @xmath203 . in one class of string inspired models , where the @xmath162 symmetry and the gut symmetry break at the same scale , the right handed neutrino masses are generated by nonrenormalizable operators and they are given in the simplest approximation by @xmath204 gev . if @xmath205 , then one gets @xmath206 ev which is the right value to fit the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "the rest of the data such as the maximal mixing with the muon neutrino etc are not predicted without further assumptions .",
    "even the prediction of the @xmath62 mass requires an assumption that the yukawa coupling @xmath189 must be unity .",
    "the most natural grand unified theory for the seesaw mechanism is the so(10 ) model . in this paragraph ,",
    "some of the salient features of this realization are summarized . from the previous paragraph , we learn that the simplest left right model with b - l=2 triplets provides provides a direct realization of the seesaw mechanism . in the context of the so(10 ) model ,",
    "the first point to note is that the * 16 * -dimensional spinor representation contains all the fermions of each generation in the standard plus the right handed neutrino .",
    "thus the right handed neutrino is automatic in the so(10 ) model .",
    "secondly , in order to break the b - l symmetry present in the so(10 ) group , one may use either the higgs multiplets in * 16 * or * 126 * dimensional representation . under the left - right symmetric group @xmath207 , these fields decompose as follows : @xmath208 where the ellipses denote other multiplets that have no role in neutrino mass discussion . in order to break the b - l symmetry",
    "it is the last entry in each of the multiplets whose neutral elements need to pick up a large vev .",
    "note however that the first one ( i.e. the @xmath209 ) does not have any renormalizable coupling with the * 16 * spinors which contain the @xmath210 whereas there is a renormalizable so(10 ) invariant coupling of the form @xmath211 . for the second multiplet .",
    "therefore if we decided to stay with the renormalizable model , then one would need a * 126 * dimensional representation to implement the seesaw mechanism whereas if we used the * 16 * to break the b - l symmtery , we would require nonrenormalizable couplings of the form @xmath212 .",
    "this has important implications for the b - l scale . in the former case ,",
    "the b - l breaking scale is at an intermediate level such as @xmath213 gev or so whereas in the latter case , we can have b - l scale coincide with the gut scale of @xmath214 gev as in the typical susygut models@xcite .",
    "another advantage of so(10 ) models in understanding neutrino masses is that if one uses only the * 10 * dimensional representation for giving masses to the quarks and leptons , one has the up quark mass matrix @xmath215 being equal to the dirac mass matrix of the neutrinos which goes into the seesaw formula . as a result ,",
    "if we work in a basis where the up quark masses are diagonal so that all ckm mixings come from the down mass matrix , then the number of arbitrary parameters in the seesaw formula goes dowm from 12 to 6 .",
    "thus even though one can not predict neutrino masses and mixings , the parameters of the theory get fixed by their values as inputs .",
    "this may then be testable thru its other predictions . in this model however , there are tree level mass relations in the down sector such as @xmath216 which are renormalization group invariant and are in disagreement with observations",
    ". it may be possible in supersymmetric models to generate enough one loop corrections out of the supersymmetry breaking terms ( nonuniversal ) to save the situation .",
    "there is one very special cases where all 12 of these parameters are predicted by the quark and lepton masses@xcite .",
    "the higgs content of this model is only one * 10 * and one",
    "* 126*. their yukawa couplings involve only nine parameters all of which along with input vevs of the doublets in both these multiplets are fixed by the quark masses , mixings and the three charged lepton masses .",
    "the important point is that the same * 126 * responsible for the fermion masses also has a vev along the @xmath217 directions so that it generates the right handed neutrino mass matrix .",
    "thus in the light neutrino sector it is a completely parameter free model .",
    "but this minimal so(10 ) model can not fit both the solar and the atmospheric neutrino data and is therefore ruled out . recently other so(10 ) models have been considered where under different assumptions , the atmospheric and solar neutrino data can be explained together@xcite .",
    "these models have many interesting features , which we do not go into here for lack of space .    in the minimal supersymmetric",
    "left - right model , an analogous situation happens where the neutrino dirac masses are found to be equal to the charged lepton masses@xcite .",
    "thus in this model too , one has only six parameters to describe the neutrino sector and once the neutrino data is fitted all parameters in the model are fixed so that one has predictions that can be tested .",
    "for instance , it has been emphasized in ref.@xcite that there is a prediction for the @xmath218 in this model that is about two orders of magnitude below the present limits@xcite and could therefore ne used to test the model .",
    "there is yet another class of models where by assigning @xmath26 charges to the fermions of the standard model as well as the @xmath210 fields@xcite , one restricts the dirac as well as majorana mass matrices ( for the @xmath210 ) .",
    "one then assumes that the @xmath26 charges originate from strings or some high scale physics .",
    "finally let us comment that in models where the light neutrino mass is understood via the seesaw mechanism that uses heavy righthanded neutrinos , there is a very simple mechanism for the generation of baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "since the righthanded neutrino has a high mass , it decays at a high temperature to generate a lepton asymmetry@xcite and this lepton asymmetry is converted to baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron effects@xcite at lower temperature .",
    "it also turns out that one of the necessary conditions for sufficient leptogenesis is that the right handed neutrinos must be heavy as is required by the seesaw mechanism . to see this note that one of sakharov conditions for leptogenesis is that the right handed neutrino decay must be slower than the expansion rate of the universe at the temperature @xmath219 .",
    "the corresponding condition is : @xmath220 this implies that @xmath221 . for the second generation",
    ", it implies that @xmath222 gev and for the third generation a value even higher . note that these are above the inflation reheating upper bound alluded to before .",
    "however for the first generation , it is about @xmath223 gev so that there is no conflict with the gravitino bound on the reheating temperature .",
    "incidentally , the leptogenesis condition also imposes limits on the matrix elements of the right handed neutrino mass , thereby reducing the arbitrariness of the seesaw predictions slightly .",
    "in this section we like to discuss some issues related to the degenerate neutrino hypothesis . recall that this is the only scenario that fits all observations if one does not include lsnd ( say it is not confirmed by miniboone ) and the universe has 10% to 20% of its matter in the form of neutrinos .",
    "thus it is appropriate to discuss how such models can arise in theoretical schemes and how stable they are under radiative corrections .",
    "the first point already alluded to before and first made in @xcite is that degenerate neutrinos arise naturally in models that employ the type ii seesaw since the first term in the mass formula is not connected to the charged fermion masses .",
    "one way that has been discussed is to consider schemes where one uses symmetries such as so(3 ) or su(2 ) or permutation symmetry @xmath224@xcite so that the majorana yukawa couplings @xmath225 are all equal .",
    "this then leads to the dominant contribution to all neutrinos being equal .",
    "this symmetry however must be broken in the charged fermion sector in order to explain the observed quark and lepton masses . such models consistent with known data have been constructed based on so(10 ) as well as other groups .",
    "the interesting point about the so(10 ) realization is that the dominant contributions to the @xmath51 s in this model comes from the second term in the type ii seesaw formula which in simple models is hierarchical .",
    "it is of course known that if the msw solution to the solar neutrino puzzle is the right solution ( or an energy independent solution ) , then we have @xmath226 .",
    "in fact if we use the fact true in so(10 ) models that @xmath227 , then we have @xmath228 and @xmath229 where @xmath98 is the common mass for the three neutrinos .",
    "it is interesting that for @xmath230 few ev and @xmath231 gev , both the @xmath51 s are close to the required values .",
    "an interesting theoretical issue about these models has been raised in several recent papers@xcite .",
    "it has been noted that even though one may have tree level models with a degenerate neutrino spectrum , it is not clear that this mass degeneracy will survive the radiative corrections .",
    "in fact it has been convincingly argued that in models with maximal mixings the departure from degeneracy may be significant .",
    "this provides a further challenge to model building and one must ensure that should maximal mixing models win the day , the degeneracy is preserved upto at least to two loop .",
    "if the existence of the sterile neutrino becomes confirmed say , by a confirmation of the lsnd observation of @xmath90 oscillation or directly by sno neutral current data to come in the early part of the next century , a key theoretical challenge will be to construct an underlying theory that embeds the sterile neutrino along with the others with appropriate mixing pattern , while naturally explaining its ultralightness .",
    "if a sterile neutrino was introduced into the standard model , the gauge symmetry would not forbid its bare mass , implying that there would be no reason for it mass to be small .",
    "it is a common experience in physics that if a particle has mass lighter than normally expected on the basis of known symmetries , then it is an indication for the existence of new symmetries .",
    "this line of reasoning has been pursued in recent literature to understand the ultralightness of the sterile neutrino by using new symmetries beyond the standard model .",
    "there are several suggestions for this new symmetry that might help us to accomodate an ultralight @xmath58 and in the process lead us to new classes of extensions of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we will consider two examples ( i ) one based on the @xmath232 grand unification model and ( ii)another based on the possible existence of mirror matter in the universe .",
    "there are also other theoretical models for the sterile neutrino that we involve different assumptions@xcite and we do not discuss them here .    a completely different way to understand the ultralightness of the sterile neutrino is to introduce large extra dimensions in a kaluza - klein framework@xcite and not rely on any symmetries . in these models ,",
    "the sterile neutrino is supposed to live in the bulk ; therefore if its lagrangian mass is zero , then the mass of the first kaluza - klaein mode is inversely proprotional to the size of the extra dimension .",
    "thus the extra dimension size of order of a millimeter would lead to sterile neutrino masses in the range of milli ev s which are of interest for solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "there have been recent attempts@xcite to build realistic models using a slight variation of this idea@xcite .",
    "this class of models are distinguished from others in their prediction of infinite tower of sterile neutrinos , which at the moment seems perfectly consistent with observations .",
    "eventually , this feature may provide a way to test such theories .",
    "we do not elaborate on these models any further .",
    "@xmath232@xcite is an interesting and viable unification group beyond the so(10 ) group and as such has been extensively discussed in literature@xcite . in this model",
    ", matter belongs to the * 27 * dimensional representation of the @xmath232 group which under its @xmath233 subgroup decomposes to @xmath234 ( the subscripts represent the u(1 ) charges ) .",
    "the * 16 * is well known to contain the left and the right handed neutrinos ( to be denoted by us as @xmath235 and @xmath236 , @xmath237 being the family index ) .",
    "the * 10 * contains two neutral colorless fermions which behave like neutrinos but are @xmath36 doublets and the last neutral colorless fermion in the * 27 * , which we identify as the sterile neutrino is the one contained in the so(10 ) singlet multiplet ( denoted by @xmath238 ) .",
    "this has all the properties desired of a sterile neutrino .",
    "thus in this model there are three sterile neutrinos which will be denoted by the corresponding flavor label and we will show first how the small mass for both the active and the sterile neutrino results from a generalization of the the seesaw mechanism as a consequence of the symmetries of the group@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will see how as a consequence of the smallness of the yukawa couplings of the standard model , we will not only get maximal mixing between the active and the sterile neutrinos of each generation but also the necessary ultra - small @xmath51 needed in the vacuum oscillation solution to the solar neutrino puzzle without fine tuning of parameters@xcite .",

    "it is assumed that @xmath249 and @xmath250 are both linear combinations arising partially from the @xmath247 and partially from the @xmath248    in addition to the above there is another field labelled by @xmath251 whose @xmath245 component mixes with a singlet s and one linear combination of this pair remains light below the gut scale . as a consequence of radiative symmetry breaking this picks up a vev at the electroweak scale .",
    "this was shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "the remaining components of @xmath251 have gut scale mass .",
    "let us now write down the relevant terms in the superpotential that lead to a @xmath239 `` neutrino '' mass matrix of the form we desire . to keep matters simple",
    "let us ignore generation mixings , which can be incorporated very trivially .",

    "since we are dealing with a supersymmetric theory , radiative corrections will not generate any new terms in the superpotential .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( 41 ) , since it is the first term that leads to lepton and quark masses of various generations , it carries a generation label and obeys a hierarchical pattern , whereas the @xmath225 s not being connected to known fermion masses need not obey a hierarchical pattern .",
    "we will from now on assume that each @xmath253 .",
    "after substituting the vevs for the higgs fields in the above equation , we find a @xmath239 mass matrix of the following form for the neutral lepton fields of each generation in the basis @xmath254 : @xmath255 here @xmath256 is the mass of the right handed neutrino and @xmath257 is the mass of the entire * 10 * -plet in the * 27 * matter multiplet . since *",
    "10 * contains two full su(5 ) multiplets , gauge coupling unification will not be effected even though we choose its mass to be below the gut scale .",
    "note that the @xmath258 mass matrix involving the @xmath259 have superheavy entries and will therefore decouple at low energies .",
    "their effects on the spectrum of the light neutrinos will be dictated by the seesaw mechanism@xcite .",
    "the light neutrino mass matrix involving @xmath260 can be written down as : @xmath261    where @xmath262 .",
    "note that @xmath263 is expected to be of order one .",
    "this leads to the @xmath115 mass matrix for the @xmath264 fields of each generation the form ,    @xmath265    here @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath268 .",
    "taking @xmath269 , @xmath270 and reasonable values of the unknown parameters e.g. @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath253 , @xmath273 , we get @xmath274 ev and @xmath275 which leads us to the desired pattern of masses and mass differences where active neutrinos of each generation mix with the corresponding sterile neutrino maximally and the @xmath51 s scale as the cube of the corresponding charged fermion mass . thus if we fix the @xmath276 ev@xmath53 , then we get the vacuum oscillation solution for the solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "this model also provides an explanation of the lsnd results and the smallness of the mixing angle observed in the experiment is now similar to that observed in the quark sector and therefore easily understood by the same mechanisms that provide an explanation of the small quark mixing angles .",
    "the second suggestion that explains the ultralightness of the @xmath58 is the mirror matter model@xcite where the basic idea is that there is a complete duplication of matter and forces in the universe ( i.e. two sectors in the universe with matter and gauge forces identical prior to symmetry breaking ) .",
    "the mirror sector of the model will then have three light neutrinos which will not couple to the z - boson and would not therefore have been seen at lep .",
    "we denote the fields in the mirror sector by a prime over the standard model fields .",
    "we will call the @xmath277 as the sterile neutrinos of which we now have three .",
    "the lightness of @xmath277 is dictated by the mirror @xmath278 symmetry in a manner parallel to what happens in the standard model .",
    "thus the ultralightness of the sterile neutrinos is understood in the most `` painless '' way .",
    "the two `` universes '' are assumed to communicate only via gravity@xcite or other forces that are equally weak .",
    "this leads to a mixing between the neutrinos of the two universes and can cause oscillations between @xmath55 of our universe to @xmath279 of the parallel one in order to explain for example the solar neutrino deficit .    at an overall level ,",
    "such a picture emerges quite naturally in superstring theories which lead to @xmath280 gauge theories below the planck scale with both @xmath281s connected by gravity .",
    "for instance , one may assume the sub - planck gut group to be a subgroup of @xmath282 in anticipation of possible future string embedding .",
    "one may also imagine the visible sector and the mirror sector as being in two different d - branes , which are then necessarily connected very weakly due to exchange of massive bulk kaluza - klein excitations .    in the mirror model , both sectors can either remain identical after symmetry breaking or there can be asymmetry .",
    "we will consider the second scenario .",
    "this was suggested in ref.@xcite .    as suggested in ref.@xcite",
    ", we will assume that the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking introduces asymmetry between the two universes e.g. the weak scale @xmath283 in the mirror universe is larger than the weak scale @xmath284 gev in our universe .",
    "the ratio of the two weak scales @xmath285 is the only parameter that enters the fit to the solar neutrino data .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that with @xmath286 , the gravitationally generated neutrino masses@xcite can provide a resolution of the solar neutrino puzzle ( i.e. one parameter generates both the required @xmath287 and the mixing angle @xmath288 ) .",
    "there can also be a large angle msw fit with reasonable choice of parameters e.g. smaller @xmath289 but with coefficients of higher dimensional operators allowed to vary between 0.3 to 3 .",
    "there are other ways to connect the visible sector with the mirror sector using for instance a bilinear term involving the righthanded neutrinos from the mirror and the visible sector .",
    "an @xmath290 realization of this idea was studied in detail in a recent paper@xcite , where a complete realistic model for known particles and forces including a fit to the fermion masses and mixings was worked out and the resulting predictions for the masses and mixings for the normal and mirror neutrinos were presented . in this model , the fermions of each generation are assigned to the @xmath291 representation of the gauge group .",
    "the @xmath292 symmetry is broken down to the left - right symmetric model by the combination of @xmath293 representations in each sector . the @xmath294 gauge symmetry in turn",
    "is broken by the @xmath295 representations .",
    "these latter fields serve two purposes : first , they guarantee automatic r - parity conservation and second , they lead to the see - saw suppression for the neutrino masses .",
    "we do not get into detailed discussion of the masses and mixings of neutrinos in such a model here .",
    "the mixing between the two sectors is caused by a multiplet belonging to the representation @xmath296 .",
    "if the mass of this last multiplet is kept at the gut scale , the mixing between the two righthanded neutrinos caused by this is large and the ensuing effects on the light neutrino mixings are small .",
    "since the mirror matter model has many ultralight particles , the issue of consistency with big bang nucleosynthesis must be addressed .",
    "recall that present observations of helium and deuterium abundance can allow for at most @xmath297 neutrino species@xcite if the baryon to photon ratio is chosen appropriately .",
    "since the model has three extra neutrinos , an extra photon and the extra @xmath298 pair , apriori , the effective neutrino count in the model could be as alrge as 8.2 .",
    "however , in the asymmetric mirror model , since the neutrinos decouple above 200 mev or so due to weakness of the mirror fermi coupling , their contribution at the time of nucleosynthesis is negligible ( i.e. they contribute about @xmath299 to @xmath300 . ) on the other hand the mirror photon could be completely in equilibrium at @xmath301 mev so that it will contribute @xmath302 .",
    "there is also a contribution from the mirror electron - positron pair of @xmath303 .",
    "all together the total contribution to @xmath304 is less than @xmath305 .",
    "so to solve this problem , we invoke an idea called asymmetric inflation whereby the reheating temperature in the mirror sector is lower than the reheating temperature in the familiar sector .",
    "models with this kind of possibility was discussed in @xcite",
    ".    there may be another potentially very interesting application of the idea of the mirror universe .",
    "it appears that there may be a crisis in understanding the microlensing observations@xcite .",
    "it has to do with the fact that the best fit mass for the 14 observed microlensing events by the macho and the eros group is around @xmath306 and it appears difficult to use normal baryonic objects of similar mass such as white dwarfs to explain these events , since they lead to a number of cosmological and astrophysical problems@xcite .",
    "speculations have been advanced tha this crisis may also be resolved by the postulate that the machos with @xmath307 may be mirror stars@xcite which would then have none of the difficulties that arise from interpretations in terms of conventional baryonic matter . in this model ,",
    "mirror baryons can form the dark matter of the universe so that there is no need for a neutralino dark matter .",
    "in this review , we have tried to provide a brief look at the new physics implied by the discovery of neutrino oscillations .",
    "we start with a summary of the possible textures for neutrino masses implied by the present data with and without the inclusion of the lsnd data .",
    "several three , four and six neutrino scenarios have been outlined .",
    "we then briefly describe the various ideas primarily aimed at understanding the smallness of the neutrino masses both in the context of grand or simple unified models .",
    "finally two theories that can naturally incorporate an ultralight sterile neutrino are discussed .",
    "clearly , there is considerable subjective judgement used in the selection of models and an apology is due to all authors whose models are not discussed here .",
    "limitations of space is certainly one simple excuse that can be given . in any case ,",
    "the final story in this field is yet to be written and it could very easily be that the models described here do not eventually win out .",
    "even that will be a very valuable piece of information since the ideas touched on here are certainly some of the more salient ones around now .",
    "but it is the fervent hope of this author ( presumably shared by many workers in the field ) that some of the ideas described in the literature ( and reviewed here ) will survive the test of time .",
    "the `` ball '' is right now in the court of the experimentalists and we pin our hopes on the large number of continuing ( sno , borexino , k2k , minos ) as well as planned ( kamland , icarus , lens , genius , cuore , orland etc ) experiments in this field . on the theoretical side , true progress can be said to have been made only in understanding the smallness of the neutrino masses in different scenarios but the complete picture of mixing angles is far from being at hand , although there are many models that under various assumptions lead to realistic fits .",
    "one of the hardest theoretical problems is to understand the ultrasmall mass difference that would be required if the vacuum oscillation solution to the solar neutrino problem eventually wins the race ( although there exist a handful of interesting suggestions@xcite ) .",
    "one will then have to check whether the radiative corrections in these models destabilize the result .",
    "the bottom line is that the field of neutrino mass has become one of the most vibrant and exciting fields in particle physics as we move into the new millenium and is at the moment the only beacon of new physics beyond the standard model .",
