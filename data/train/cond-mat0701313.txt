    "moreover , the helium fraction plays a crucial role in how the mixture transforms from the molecular to the atomic phase with increasing temperature or pressure .",
    "changes in the structure of the fluid , i.e. , the transition from a molecular to a metallic fluid may be discussed in terms of the pair correlation function ( pcf ) @xmath18 pair correlation functions for different types of nuclei are shown in fig .",

    "we discuss the changes in the pair correlations with respect to density at a constant temperature of @xmath19 k. let us first comment on the hydrogen - hydrogen pair correlations in pure hydrogen .",
    "a pronounced peak at about @xmath20  demonstrates the presence of molecules in the fluid .",
    "these pair correlations are normalized so that the area under the molecular peak gives the number of molecules found in the fluid .",
    "the dissociation degree can thus be extracted either by integrating over the pcf or by invoking a distance criterion for two hydrogen atoms .",
    "table [ valuetable ] reports degrees of dissociation that where derived by analyzing the md trajectories using the distance criterion and a minimum molecular lifetime of @xmath21 vibrational periods of the isolated hydrogen molecule .",
    "the lifetime criteria leads to a decaying molecular fraction in the metallic regime , which would be overestimated based on the distance criterion alone .",
    "a high peak followed by a minimum that approaches zero is a strong indication that the molecules are stable , for instance this is the case at @xmath1 for different values of @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , this can be confirmed by directly analyzing the number and lifetime of the molecules @xcite . on the other hand , at high density ( @xmath23 , @xmath13 ) ,",
    "no isolated first peak can be identified and the shape of the pcf is typical for a correlated atomic liquid . the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig : grarray ] contains two additional graphs showing the pair correlations at densities and mixing ratios intermediate between the two extrema just discussed . in these cases ,",
    "the molecular peak can still be identified but its height is reduced and it is widened so that the first minimum has a value greater than zero .",
    "a shape like this is caused by a mixture of atoms and molecules ; where the definition of molecules here is somewhat ambiguous as they may have finite lifetimes .",
    "let us now discuss the influence of helium on the pcf .",
    "the general effect can be seen by comparing hydrogen - hydrogen pair correlation functions at identical electronic densities and different helium fractions .",
    "more helium content in the mixture generally leads to a lower hydrogen dissociation .",
    "the presence of helium atoms thus stabilizes the hydrogen molecules and the effect of pressure to dissociate hydrogen molecules is partially suppressed .",
    "a more detailed analysis revealed that in mixtures of hydrogen and helium the bond length of the hydrogen molecule is shortened by about @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the influence of helium allows hydrogen molecules to exist in a parameter regime where otherwise pure hydrogen would be dissociated .",
    "the microscopic reason for this effect is the double charge of the helium nuclei binding two electrons .",
    "these electrons are bound stronger than the electrons in a hydrogen molecule and are more localized , which has profound effects on the high pressure properties of the fluid @xcite . in the mixture , atoms and molecules can be packed more closely before electronic wavefunctions begin to overlap .",
    "when molecules are compressed and wave functions begin to overlap , their localization increases because of the exclusion principle , which means larger kinetic energy .",
    "but the kinetic and potential energies scale differently with density , so eventually , it is energetically more favorable for the electrons to delocalize ( lower kinetic energy , higher potential energy ) .",
    "we also examine helium - helium ( he - he ) and hydrogen - helium ( h - he ) pair correlation functions extracted from the dft - md simulations .",
    "both , he - he and h - he pair correlation functions show a finite probability for finding a neighboring atom only for distances larger than @xmath25  .",
    "this value reflects the bigger radius of a helium atom compared to a hydrogen atom .",
    "hydrogen - helium correlations are similar to the continuous part of the hydrogen - hydrogen pcfs .",
    "naturally , there is no molecular peak and significant contributions occur at distances larger than the first minimum of the hydrogen - hydrogen pcfs .",
    "thereafter , similar weak short - range order expressed in oscillations around unity can be observed .",
    "there are only minor differences between hydrogen - helium correlation functions of different mixing ratios .    .",
    "values for pressure ( 1st line ) and fraction of atoms bound in molecules ( 2nd line ) at various densities and mixing ratios at @xmath26 k. these values belong to the pair correlation functions in fig .",
    "[ fig : grarray ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the correlations in the helium subsystem can be described as short - range hard sphere type interactions .",
    "interestingly , the helium - helium pair correlations show a more pronounced first peak in the @xmath14 mixture than in the @xmath15 mixture and they again feature a slightly higher peak than the ones for pure helium .",
    "there is a bigger total number of hydrogen atoms present for a lower mixing ratio @xmath22 at constant electronic density .",
    "two hydrogen atoms or one hydrogen molecule have a bigger volume than one helium atom . the effective density for the helium atoms",
    "is thus higher in a mixture with less helium .",
    "this causes a general requirement to increased coordination among the atoms which in turn is reflected in the higher peak in the pair correlation .",
    "the effect of hydrogen on helium can be understood as the opposite of the effect of helium on hydrogen .",
    "the observed structure in helium - helium and hydrogen - helium pair correlations illustrates the importance of the interaction between the subsystems and is an indication that the linear mixing rule is only a first approximation for describing mixtures @xcite .    , and helium for two different electronic density parameters @xmath17 : a ) @xmath27 corresponds to @xmath28 g/@xmath3 in hydrogen , and b ) @xmath23 corresponds to @xmath29 g/@xmath3 in hydrogen .",

    "the pressure isochores show some distinct features depending on the helium concentration .",
    "since helium atoms are smaller than hydrogen molecules , one finds that at low temperature the pressure decreases substantially when hydrogen molecules are replaced by helium atoms at constant volume , which leaves the total electronic density unchanged . in pure hydrogen ,",
    "the isochores exhibit a region with a negative slope @xmath30 , which is due to the delocalization of the electrons during the dissociation of hydrogen molecules .",
    "a higher helium fraction reduces the magnitude of the drop in pressure ( e.g. for @xmath14 ) or even completely removes it ( @xmath15 ) . as a result",
    ", one finds that the @xmath31 curves for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 approximately converge in the dissociated regime .",
    "there , the pressure depends only little on the helium concentration because the ( ideal ) ionic pressure increase and the pressure decrease due to electronic delocalization depend inversely on the mixing ratio . only for large helium concentration",
    "this cancellation effect does not occur anymore as the comparison with the @xmath16 curve shows .",
    "[ fig : diffx ] alone demonstrates temperature dissociation . by comparing the left and the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : diffx ] , it is possible to observe pressure dissociation , too .",

    "this means that , by increasing the density at constant temperature , one can transfer from a molecular fluid to an atomic fluid as well .",
    "the structure of the fluid and the equation of state for hydrogen - helium mixtures were analyzed under conditions found in giant gas planets .",
    "we have considered the structural changes in the fluid during dissociation as function of density and helium concentration .",

    "such data are needed in order to improve existing models for giant gas planets and answer longstanding question concerning their development and inner structure .    in particular , we find that helium plays a crucial role in affecting hydrogen dissociation both as a function of temperature and pressure .",
