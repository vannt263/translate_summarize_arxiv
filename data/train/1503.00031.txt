    "the ability to engineer and manipulate the spatial wave function of a quantum particle has far - reaching applications in many areas of physics .",
    "one example is the so - called `` beam - splitting '' , a coherent division of an atomic or molecular wave function into two or more non - overlapping wave packets ( wps ) , which is indispensable in matter - wave interferometry @xcite .",
    "another example is generation of `` squeezed states '' , i.e. , wps with a reduced uncertainty in one dynamical variable ( at the expense of an increased uncertainty in the conjugate variable ) that are widely used to enhance the precision of quantum measurements @xcite . to date , various mechanisms of reshaping matter wps have been explored , some of which utilize time - dependent harmonic traps @xcite , quantum holography @xcite , spatially homogeneous laser light with time - dependent amplitude in the presence of a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field @xcite , periodic potentials @xcite , time - dependent electric fields in atom chips @xcite , finite - length attractive optical lattices with a slowly varying envelope @xcite , or chaotic scattering dynamics @xcite .",
    "here we report an alternative approach based on the principle of time - dependent absorption that has versatile applications .        in this paper",
    ", we show that a localized quantum wp can be efficiently manipulated  spatially shifted , split , squeezed and cooled  by making it pass through a time - dependent absorbing barrier , i.e. , a narrow region of space acting as a particle density sink ( see ref .",

    "the absorbing barrier can be realized in the context of atom - optics with a sheet of laser light intercepting the motion of an atomic cloud ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the radiation frequency of the laser can be chosen such that a passing atom becomes undetectable due to ionization or a change of its internal state , and thus effectively absorbed .",
    "furthermore , the strength of this absorption process can be made time - dependent by varying the intensity of the laser in accordance with an externally prescribed function of time .    to further exemplify the process of time - dependent absorption",

    "the probability of the transition is nonzero only inside the light sheet , i.e , . in a close vicinity of the point @xmath4 , and can be made to depend on time by externally modifying the intensity of the laser . at some time @xmath7 , the atom will be found in a state @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote spatial wave functions corresponding to the internal states @xmath11 and @xmath6 , respectively . in what follows below ,",
    "we will only be concerned with a projection of the full atomic state on @xmath5 , and will regard the rest of the state , @xmath12 , from @xmath3 to @xmath9 , induced by the light sheet playing the role of an absorbing barrier .",
    "the problem of a non - relativistic quantum particle interacting with an absorbing barrier has a long history and is a paradigm of the theory of quantum transients @xcite .",
    "the limit of an instantaneously opening or closing barrier , first addressed by moshinsky , was shown to cause well - pronounced oscillations of the probability density distribution ; this effect is known as `` diffraction in time '' ( dit ) and bears close mathematical analogy to optical diffraction of light at an aperture with straight edges @xcite .",
    "dit is generally suppressed if the barrier switching is not sufficiently abrupt @xcite or if the particle momentum distribution exhibits incoherent thermal broadening @xcite . in a many particle scenario ,",
    "the interaction between particles is also known to suppress dit @xcite .",
    "here we address the motion of a quantum wp in the presence of an absorbing barrier that may , during some intervals of time , open or close exponentially fast , but yet not fast enough to trigger dit .",
    "we show that this subtle regime , being well within experimental reach , allows for controlled reshaping of the wp through the process of removing ( or `` carving out '' ) parts of the probability density profile without a side effect of producing diffraction ripples .",
