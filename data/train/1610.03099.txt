    "the side centered square lattice , i.e. the lieb lattice , was first proposed in @xcite as a rigorous example of itinerant ferromagnetism in the presence of on - site hubbard interactions at half - filling .",
    "recently , the lieb lattice received renewed attention in the context of optical and photonic lattices @xcite , 2d superconductivity @xcite , or for its specific topological properties @xcite .",
    "in particular , the artificial lattice realization offers the advantage of parameters controlling , leading to various regimes not available in real - atoms lattices , so that one can test a vast spectrum of theoretical prediction .",
    "the lieb lattice can have non - trivial magnetic properties @xcite and its own specificity originates in the degenerate energy level called also a `` flat band '' ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , which is located at the middle of the spectrum .",
    "this flat band is one from the total of _ three _ bands of the lieb lattice , consistent with the three atoms unit cell . while the electron - hole symmetry imposes that this band is located at precisely _",
    "zero _ energy , its exact degeneracy for a given finite lattice depends also on the border conditions .",
    "let us now picture a situation in which such a flat band is half - filled .",
    "then , a legitimate question would be whether the system obeys the hund rule with maximum spin of the electrons on the degenerate levels , say @xmath1 , or may they have a lower total spin .",
    "the applicability of the hund rule in various nano - systems have been a subject of considerable interest ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , both from applicative and fundamental points of view , for understanding the most intimate mechanisms of magnetism .",
    "the results presented in this paper shall add to the existing debate an instance when the hund rule does not apply .",
    "at this point it is important to mention two well - known theorems that give the ground state spin for some particular lattices with hubbard interaction .",
    "we shall also define some labeling of states used in the paper :    * the lieb theorem @xcite states that , for a half - filled bipartite lattice ( composed of two sub - lattices , say , a and b , and with hopping only between sites from different sub - lattices ) , with even total number of sites and with on - site hubbard repulsion , the spin of the ground state is @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , being the number of sites of the sub - lattice a ) .",
    "needless to say , the lieb lattice itself is bipartite .",
    "its ground state spin is thus given by the sites number mismatch between the two sub - lattices , the theorem stating also that the ground state is not degenerate ( excluding the trivial @xmath4 spin degeneracy ) .",
    "the state lowest in energy from the sub - space with spin @xmath5 shall be referred throughout the paper as the `` lieb '' state . *",
    "the mielke theorem @xcite states that a flat band located at the lowest part of the spectrum will always have the maximum spin ground state @xmath6 , if filled up to at most half , in the presence of hubbard interaction . for exactly half filling",
    ", the maximum spin ground state may be degenerate only with the state with a single spin flipped ( excluding again the trivial spin degeneracy ) . throughout this paper , such a state with the maximum spin value of the electrons in a flat band or degenerate level will be referred as `` hund '' state with spin @xmath7 , for the correspondence with the atomic physics rule .    in this paper we shall address finite lieb lattices with up to @xmath0 number of cells , or elementary squares , as the one depicted in fig.1 and we shall impose vanishing boundary conditions .",
    "technically , this means that we can start from the infinite 2d lieb lattice from which one cuts the smaller lattice of interest by imposing the wave functions to be _ zero _ on the exterior points ( for the square in fig.1 the wave functions vanish on the sites @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc .",
    "-that are not drawn- ) , as opposed to periodicity conditions .",
    "the vanishing boundary conditions are particularly relevant for small lattices , with influence on the physical properties . in @xcite for instance , the authors consider antiperiodic conditions instead , and obtain a different number of levels in the flat band .    for our case , the mid - spectrum level degeneracy is @xmath11 @xcite and the interesting problem here is that the spin values predicted by the above theorems at half - filling are different .",
    "they are @xmath12 for the lieb state and @xmath13 for the hund one @xcite , being related by the formula @xmath14 and suggesting a single spin - flip process between them .",
    "however -and as shall be shown- one does not face a contradiction since the lieb lattices do not have the degenerate flat - band at the bottom of the spectrum , but in its middle , and we shall show that the interaction with the below electrons proves decisive in imposing the ground state spin . nevertheless , it shall be insightful throughout the paper to discuss also the spin properties of the _ isolated _ degenerate levels for small lieb lattices , hence the relevance of the mielke theorem here .",
    "both the lieb and mielke theorems have been rigourously proven only for on - site hubbard interaction , so if one includes as well long - range interaction , the results are no longer a priori known , justifying our approach .",
    "also , for the case of nano - systems , one is typically interested not as much in the ground states configurations , but especially in the excitation energies which are the experimentally measurable quantities .",
    "moreover we shall give insights on the mechanisms that impose the lieb state as the ground state using the nonoverlapping property of one of the states in the mid - spectrum @xcite and the electron - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in this paper , a particular attention will be paid to the smallest one - cell lieb lattice depicted in fig.1 , which allows ( having only eight sites ) an analytical solution at small interactions , as well as numerical exact diagonalization for any value of the interactions .",
    "if only hubbard interaction is considered we are in the frame of the lieb theorem .",
    "however our alternative proof for this specific system allows for an insight on the role of the states spacial distributions and their symmetry properties .",
    "similar arguments are presented for two - cell lieb lattice that , having odd number of sites , falls outside of the lieb theorem conditions .",
    "the long - range interaction included in our calculations will show that the ground state spin remains unaffected , even if the electronic configuration itself may change .    for lattices of sizes",
    "@xmath15 , numerical results will be presented making use of a combined mean - field and configuration - interaction method ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , an approach particularly justified for weak interactions .",
    "the results concur with those obtained for the smallest @xmath16 lattice , and the lieb state energy is lower than the hund state energy both for even and odd number of sites , even when long range interaction is turned on . for @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ", the lieb state @xcite corresponds to the minimum spin [ this being @xmath18 for @xmath19 , however for @xmath20 and @xmath0 the `` paramagnetic '' state -of minimum spin- differs from the lieb state and emerges as ground state when the interaction ratio long - range versus hubbard exceeds a certain value .",
    "this is attributed to the long - range interaction favouring the lowest spin ground state @xcite .",
    "various shape of nanoscale lattices can be created as artificial semiconductor quantum dot molecules @xcite .",
    "we briefly mention the experimental realization of quadruple quantum dots molecules @xcite and theoretical investigations related to this subject , including also the interaction effects of half filled systems @xcite .",
    "the artificial benzene molecules is theoretically studied @xcite and is proposed as an ultracold atom system in @xcite . using gaas , inas or si quantum dots as building blocks various sizes of lieb type systems with inter - dot distances @xmath21 nm @xcite can be tailored .",
    "this opens the posibility to explore the properties of hubbard like interaction hamiltonian in few sites lieb lattices as studied here .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii we give the hamiltonian and describe the singlet - triplet formulation , section iii gives both analytical insights and exact diagonalization results for the one cell lieb lattice , while section iv addresses numerically bigger cells with @xmath15 .",
    "the appendixes provide calculations details for the main sections and also analytical insights on the two - cell lieb lattice .",
    "let us consider a 2d lattice with the noninteracting hamiltonian @xmath22 having the single particle eigenstates ( or noninteracting orbitals in @xcite ) @xmath23 and the corresponding energies @xmath24 .",
    "when the electron - electron interaction is considered as well , the total hamiltonian can be generically written in the second quantization @xmath25 where @xmath26 and its conjugated @xmath27 are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators of the states @xmath28 in the occupation number base , corresponding to one electron in the state @xmath23 with spin @xmath29 .",

    "the energy unit is the hopping integral that is considered @xmath41 and we work with @xmath42 .    in the tight - binding model , suitable for lattices such as the lieb ones we consider here , the coulombian matrix elements are the sum of on - site hubbard and inter - site long range interaction terms @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the discrete lattice sites and @xmath45 , @xmath46 their space coordinates that are expressed in terms of the lattice constant @xmath47 . in fig.[1cell ]",
    "@xmath47 is the square length . @xmath48 and",
    "@xmath49 give the hubbard and long range interaction strengths .",
    "for a quantum dot array with the confinement potential described in @xcite the hubbard parameter is @xmath50 with @xmath51 the dot radius depending on the confinement and @xmath52 the dielectric constant .",
    "if we consider the long range interaction parameter @xmath53 we obtain the ratio @xmath54 .",
    "as example , varying the dot radius @xmath55 the ratio @xmath56 can be modified from 0 to 0.5 .",
    "we use these values in the numerical calculations .",
    "as is well known , the hamiltonian commutes with the spin operators @xmath38 and @xmath40 . as a consequence , and as will be seen in the following sections , the eigenfunctions for two electrons will always be singlets ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) or triplets ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) states that are obtained by acting the following singlet and triplet operators on the vacuum : @xmath61    the singlet and triplet states are simply a change of basis for the operators pairs that appear in the hamiltonian , and we can easily derive the matrix elements of @xmath62 in this basis , relations that will prove useful in the following spectral calculations : @xmath63    the full eigenfunctions @xmath35 for larger number of electrons ( for the one - cell lattice for instance we shall need _ eight _ electrons ) , will be conveniently expressed by grouping pairs of electrons into singlet and triplet states .",
    "we mention that the greek indices @xmath64 , @xmath65 ... are for the single particle eigenstates ( or orbital states ) and latin indices @xmath66 , @xmath67 are for the lattice sites .",
    "now we shall specialize the generic hamiltonian given in the previous section , for the particular case of a square with centered sides depicted in fig.[1cell ] .",
    "as shall be seen , this smallest realization of a lieb lattice already has a degenerate level in the middle of the spectrum , raising non - trivial questions like the ground state spin at half filling or the values of the first excitation energy .",
    "the two mid - spectrum degenerate levels are spatially disjoint ( nonoverlapping ) , causing a vanishing exchange interaction between two electrons occupying them and consequently a degeneracy between singlet and triplet states .",
    "we show however that the degeneracy is lift in the favour of the singlet state , that is remaining the unique ground state when the configurations involving the rest of the spectrum are considered .",

    "<S> we present detailed spectral calculations for small lieb lattices having up to @xmath0 number of cells , in the regime of half - filling , an instance of particular relevance for the nano - magnetism of discrete systems such as quantum dot arrays , due to the degenerate levels at mid - spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> while for the hubbard interaction model -and even number of sites- the ground state spin is given by the lieb theorem , the inclusion of long range interaction -or odd number of sites- make the spin state not a priori known , which justifies our approach . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate also the excitation energies , which are of experimental importance , and find significant variation induced by the interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains insights on the mechanisms involved that impose as ground state the lieb state with lower spin rather than the hund one with maximum spin for the degenerate levels , showing this in the first and second order of the interaction potential for the smaller lattices . the analytical results concorde with the numerical ones , which are performed by exact diagonalization calculations or by a combined mean - field and configuration interaction method . </S>",
    "<S> while the lieb state is always lower in energy than the hund state , for strong long - range interaction , when possible , another minimal spin state is imposed as ground state . </S>"
