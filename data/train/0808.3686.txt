    "in fact , some one - dimensional and two - dimensional compounds ( @xmath15 ) have manifested such interactions .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to include next - nearest neighbouring interaction in the studies of spin chain entanglement .",
    "+ the 1d heisenberg model is a simple but realistic and extensively studied in solid state system .",

    "meanwhile , the entanglement shares many features with quantum phase transition ( qpt ) for a many - body system.@xmath20}$ ] qpt , which occurs at absolute zero temperature and is purely driven by quantum fluctuation , is the structural change in the properties of the ground state .",
    "the associated level crossings lead to the presence of non - analyticities in the energy spectrum .",
    "therefore , the knowledge about the ground - state entanglement , the nonlocal correlation in quantum systems , is considered as a key to further understand qpt . in this paper",
    ", we study the pairwise ground state entanglement between the nearest - neighbor sites and that of the next - nearest neighbouring sites in one - dimensional @xmath21 heisenberg xy spin chain with dimerised exchange couplings and next - nearest neighbour coupling , to our knowledge , which has not been reported before .",
    "the present study will help us to further understand the behavior of the entanglement and qpt in one - dimensional alternating heisenberg xy model with next - nearest neighbour interactions , and this model can display a variety of interesting physical phenomena .",
    "more interestingly , we can control or manipulate the nne and nnne in qpt point with the help of dimerised exchange couplings , dimerised external magnetic fields and frustrated exchange interaction .",
    "we consider one - dimensional alternating heisenberg xy model of n spin-@xmath22 particles with nearest - neighbour interactions and next - nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "one - dimensional hamiltonian can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are alternating exchange interaction and nearest - neighbour interactions respectively , @xmath26 is the strength of external magnetic field on site i , @xmath27 are the pauli matrices , @xmath28 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the anisotropy of the model and n is the total number of sites .",

    "( 2 ) reduces to one - dimensional alternating(dimerised ) heisenberg model , for @xmath44 , it reduces to one - dimensional frustrated heisenberg model .",
    "+ the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg)method@xmath45}$]is applied to obtain the spin correlation function . the two - point reduced density matrix obtained by tracing the full density matrix of the system over all sites except the pair @xmath46 has the form @xmath47 in this part , we choose the concurrence defined by wootters @xmath48}$ ] as a measurement of the pairwise entanglement . for a pure or mixed state of two qubits described by the density matrix @xmath49",
    ", the concurrence c may be calculated explicitly as @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the eigenvalues in descending order of the spin - flipped density operator r , which is defined by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath49 , @xmath58 is the usual pauli matrix .",
    "all the matrix elements in the density matrix can be calculated from the different spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "in this paper , we focus our discussion on the transverse ising model with @xmath59 and introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the goal of our present study is to find dynamic characteristics of the entanglement in varying the dimerised parameter of exchange couplings , external magnetic fields and nnn interaction .",
    "figure 1 displays the diagram of the @xmath61 model which can be considered either as a linear chain(a ) or a zigzag chain(b ) .",
    "the alternating nearest - neighbouring interaction is @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , while the next - nearest - neighbouring interaction is parameterized by @xmath64 .",
    "we consider three different physical models , i.e , dimerized ferromagnetic spin chain , frustrated ferromagnetic - ferromagnetic(f - f ) spin chain , frustrated ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic(f - af ) spin chain .",
    "first , we examine the dimerized heisenberg chain , this model is characterized by an alternation of strong and weak bonds between two nearest - neighbouring spins .",
    "figure 2 shows the nearest neighbouring concurrence c(1,2 ) and c(2,3 ) , which correspond to two nearest - neighbouring spins coupled by bonds @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , as a function of the reduced coupling constant @xmath65 at different values of the dimerised parameter @xmath66 of exchange couplings , parameter @xmath67 of external magnetic fields with the system size n = 59 . numerical results in figs.2(a ) and 2(c )",
    "show that the concurrence c(1,2 ) decreases when the dimerised parameter @xmath66 of exchange couplings increases , while for the concurrence c(2,3 ) the situation is opposite , and the pair of qubits ( 1,2 ) and ( 2,3 ) have the same pairwise entanglement for the homogeneous chain @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , in the case of weak alternation of the nearest - neighbor exchange coupling , we have here the dimerised spin chain which can be considered qualitatively as a set of non - interacting spin pairs . in the limit of strong dimerization ,",
    "the concurrence reaches a maximum value .",
    "moreover , spin 2 can be entangled both with spin 1 and with spin 3 . since spin 2",
    "is strongly entangled with spin 1 , the entanglement of spins 2 and 3 is weaker .",
    "obviously , the increase of exchange interaction @xmath63 suppresses the entanglement of spins coupled by @xmath62 .",
    "the increase of @xmath63 can enhance the entanglement between spins coupled by @xmath63 .",
    "this explains the behavior of the concurrence displayed in fig.2 .",
    "the effect of the alternation of external magnetic field @xmath67 is also shown in figs.2(b ) and 2(d ) .",
    "however , different from the effect of the exchange couplings , the concurrence ( 1,2 ) and ( 2,3 ) have similar behavior and increase firstly and then decrease with increasing the value of the parameter @xmath67 , suggesting a critical alternation of external magnetic field @xmath69 , where the maximum concurrence occurs , must be exist . + from fig.2 , we can see that the alternate interaction plays an important role in enhancing the nearest neighbouring concurrence .",
    "the maximum value of the concurrence between neighboring sites does not occur at the critical point .",
    "the reasons are based on the properties of shared entanglement to expect that this maximum should occur away from the critical point .",
    "entanglement sharing is relevant to the quantum phase transition in the transverse ising model as it provides a fundamental bound on the amount of entanglement that may be distributed among the other sites , which means that as the overall entanglement in the lattice is increased , some sites become disentangled . however , as we all know , the maximum value of the concurrence between the next - nearest - neighbouring sites does occur at the critical point @xmath70 , so it is necessary to discuss in this subsection the effect on the next - nearest - neighbouring entanglement(nnne ) .",
    "figure 3(a ) and 3(b ) show the change of concurrence c(1,3 ) as a function of @xmath65 for different values of alternate interactions @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath71 , i.e. in the absence of nnn interaction .",
    "we can see that there is no entanglement at @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the weak alternate interactions @xmath66 and @xmath67 suppress and finally completely destroy the nnn concurrence . the dashed line in fig.3(a )",
    "depicts at the critical point , @xmath70 , of the transverse ising model(@xmath68 ) , which maximum next - nearest - neighbouring entanglement occurs , there is a fundamental transition in the structure of the ground state .",
    "this is consistent with the former result .",
    "as @xmath66 increases the nnn concurrence tends to increase faster , the peak value induced by the nn interaction increases and the @xmath74 , where concurrence approaches a maximum , shifts to left very rapidly .",
    "the dimerized interaction does assist the entanglement of formation because of the inside alternation .",
    "therefore , we can further understand the relation between the entanglement and quantum transition . in figs.3(c ) and 3(d ) , we plotted our numerical results for the threshold nn alternate interactions @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the case of next - nearest - neighboring concurrence . only above the critical @xmath66 and @xmath67 , nnn",
    "concurrence appears .",
    "+ for the frustrated model , there is a competition between the nn and nnn interactions .",
    "so the model displays some special features of entanglement . in fig.4 , we give the results of the nn and nnn concurrence as a function of the parameter @xmath65 for different frustrated interaction @xmath75 .",
    "the nnn interaction has a different frustration effect on c(1,2 ) . for frustrated ferromagnetic - ferromagnetic(f - f )",
    "spin chain @xmath76 , by the comparison among the different curves in fig.4(a ) , it is interesting to find that the entanglement peak between the nearest neighbours in the dotted line increase to a value larger than those in the solid line . with the increasing of @xmath75 , in the dash - dotted line , the concurrence decreases .",
    "we can imagine there must be a critical frustration strength ( @xmath77 ) , below @xmath77 , nnn interaction enhances entanglement , while above @xmath77 , nnn interaction shrinks entanglement .",
    "this behaviour is due to the energy level cross at the point @xmath78 , as seen clearly from fig.4(a ) . before and after the critical point ,",
    "the entanglements display distinct behaviours .",
    "however , for frustrated ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic(f - af ) spin chain @xmath79 , the situation becomes different due to the frustration , with the increase in absolute value of @xmath75 and weak parameter @xmath65 , antiferromagnetic nnn interaction always shrinks entanglement , which is different from the results obtained from fig.4(a ) .",
    "another important character revealed by fig.4(b ) is that , as parameter @xmath65 increases , the concurrence increases and tends to move to infinity(@xmath80 ) by increasing the value of the parameter @xmath75 , the strong @xmath75 is helpful to keeping the better entanglement .",
    "it is the frustrated interaction that leads to considerable different evolutions of the entanglement , hence the entanglement is rather sensitive to any change with the nnn interaction . from figs.4(c ) and 4(d ) , we can see that the height of the peak increases with the increase of antiferromagnetic @xmath75 , which is a characteristic feature of one dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain .",
    "this suggests that the antiferromagnetic component becomes significant for larger @xmath75 .",
    "meanwhile , the antiferromagnetic nnn interaction results to a larger value of nnne in comparison to the case when the nnn interaction is ferromagnetic . in order to explain these results it is necessary to take into account the influence of the competing roles played by nn and nnn interaction on the entangled states .",
    "thus , by adjusting nnn interaction constant , one can control or manipulate the nn and nnn entanglement .",
    "+ in summary , from the above analysis , it is clearly noted that dimerised exchange couplings , dimerised external magnetic fields and frustrated exchange interaction , which play the competing roles in enhancing quantum entanglement , have a notable influence on nn and nnn concurrence in one - dimensional @xmath21 xy spin system .",
    "the nn and nnn concurrence exhibits some interesting phenomena . for dimerized ferromagnetic spin chain",
    ", nnne appears only above the critical dimerized interaction , which effects quantum phase transition point and increases nnne . for a ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic frustrated spin chain ,",
    "the nnn interaction is predominant in the competing role and can enhance the entanglement to a steady value .",
    "the ferromagnetic nnn interaction increases and shrinks nne below and above critical frustrated interaction respectively , while the antiferromagnetic nnn interaction always decreases nne .",
    "meanwhile , the antiferromagnetic nnn interaction can generate a larger value of nnne in comparison to the case when the nnn interaction is ferromagnetic .",
    "so we can employ nnn interaction strength as well as dimerized interaction to realize quantum entanglement control .",
    "as for the case of @xmath81(xy model ) , we will present further reports in the future .",
