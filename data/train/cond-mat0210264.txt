    "@xcite in ref .",
    "the field dependence of the proton relaxation rate @xmath6 and the temperature dependence of the muon relaxation rate have been analyzed on the basis of the standard perturbation method , that is , weak collision model .",
    "then the fluctuating local fields at the proton or the muon site have been taken to originate from the random change between the adjacent zeeman - energy levels of the ground - state configuration of the total spin of @xmath24=10 , which is caused by the spin - phonon interactions .",
    "quite recently furukawa _",

    "[ sec : discussions ] we discuss on the quantitative considerations .",
    "the final section yields the summaries of this article .",
    "the crystal and magnetic structures of the cluster of mn@xmath3ac are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal](a ) .",
    "each cluster , which constitutes a tetragonal symmetry with the lattice constants of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , is constructed from four mn@xmath34 ions ( @xmath39 ) in a central tetrahedron ( denoted by mn(1 ) ) and surrounding eight mn@xmath35 ( @xmath39 ) with two in - equivalent sites ( denoted by mn(2 ) and mn(3 ) ) located alternately .",
    "the mn atoms are linked by triply bridged oxo oxygens and by carboxylate bridges from acetate anions .",
    "the mn(1 ) and mn(2 ) have distorted octahedral coordination of oxygens due to above links . in mn(3 ) , one water molecule completes the octahedral environment of oxygens .  @xcite    there exist four kinds of exchange interactions among these manganese ions , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal](b ) .",
    "quite recently , a set of the magnitudes and signs of these exchange couplings has been determined , using exact diagonalization of the spin hamiltonian of the cluster spin by a lanzcos algorism , so as to explain the high - field magnetization and the realization of the ground state of @xmath10 .",
    "these values are @xmath40k , @xmath41k ( antiferromagnetic ) , @xmath42k ( ferromagnetic ) and , @xmath43k ,  @xcite and except the value of @xmath44 , they are different largely from the previously available values .",
    "@xcite    as a combined effect of the above exchange interactions , the ground - state configuration of the total spin of @xmath10 is established  @xcite in such a way that the assemblies of outer eight mn@xmath35 ions and the inner mn@xmath34 ions , which have respectively resultant ferromagnetic spins of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , are coupled anti - ferromagnetically to each other at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite because of the anisotropy due to jahn - teller distortion of mn@xmath35 ions , there appears a single - ion type anisotropy @xmath49 along the @xmath50-axis .",
    "thus the total magnetic moments of each cluster are either parallel or anti - parallel to the @xmath4-axis .",
    "henceforth these clusters are referred to respectively as ( @xmath51)and ( @xmath52)cluster , with respect to the @xmath4-axis taken as the @xmath53-axis .",
    "the inter - cluster interaction is only due to dipolar origin of the order of 0.5k . in the presence of an external field @xmath54 applied along the @xmath4-axis , the effective exchange hamiltonian for each cluster",
    "is given by @xmath55 where the exchange parameters have been evaluated from recent high - field esr  @xcite and neutron spectroscopy  @xcite as @xmath56 ,  @xcite @xmath57k ,  @xcite and 0.66k ,  @xcite and @xmath58-@xmath59k ,  @xcite and the sign @xmath60 correspond to the ( @xmath51)and ( @xmath52)clusters , respectively . according to this hamiltonian",
    ", the discrete energy levels @xmath61 are well defined along the @xmath53-axis in the ground - state spin configuration of @xmath10 .",
    "this gives satisfactory understandings for the most of magnetic properties of mn@xmath3ac such as an energy barrier of about 60k in zero field from the ground level of @xmath62 up to the highest level of @xmath63 , and the step - wise recovery of the magnetization at each step of about 0.45 t which occurs corresponding to the coincidence of the energy levels between @xmath64 in the ( @xmath51)cluster and @xmath65 in the ( @xmath52)cluster .",
    "in addition to the above main hamiltonian , there exists the perturbing hamiltonian @xmath66 including the terms such as higher - order transverse anisotropy and the transverse external field .",
    "these terms do not commute with @xmath67 , thus playing a crucial role for the mechanism of the tunnelling .",
    "in particular , the transverse external field gives rise to a drastic change in the tunnel - splitting at the level - crossing fields , which may promote the tunneling appreciably .",
    "@xcite      next we review the @xmath2mn hyperfine interaction tensor determined from the nmr spectra in zero field in ref .   for the numerical evaluation of the present experimental results .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows the nmr spectra of @xmath2mn ( @xmath68 ) in mn@xmath3ac obtained at 1.45k in zero field .",
    "the three completely separated lines with the central frequencies of @xmath69230 , 279 , and 364mhz , were identified to be due to mn@xmath34 ion ( mn(1 ) ) , and mn@xmath70 ion ( mn(2 ) and mn(3 ) ) , respectively .",
    "the corresponding internal fields are @xmath71 t. from now on , these three lines are referred to as l1 , l2 , and l3 , respectively .",
    "the resonance lines l1 , l2 , and l3 involve the five - fold quadrupole - splitting with @xmath72mhz , respectively .",
    "@xcite the nuclear hyperfine hamiltonian , which consists of fermi - contact , dipolar , and orbital terms , is obtained by taking the expectation values for the corresponding hamiltonians with respect to the ground - state wave - function of the magnetic ion .",
    "this hamiltonian is expressed as , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the hyperfine coupling tensor between the nuclear spin @xmath75 and the electronic spin @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 are the corresponding hyperfine fields .",
    "each of manganese ions in mn@xmath3ac is subject to the crystalline field with dominant cubic symmetry due to the surrounding distorted octahedral coordination of oxygens .",
    "the ground - state of the mn@xmath80 ion ( 3d@xmath81 , @xmath82f ) is the orbital - singlet .",
    "so the dipolar and the orbital terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : two ] ) vanishes primarily , and only the isotropic fermi - contact term is important .",
    "the corresponding fermi - contact field @xmath77 is given , using the conversion factor of 1 atomic unit ( @xmath83 ) = 4.17 t , as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the component of the tensor @xmath74 , and @xmath86 is the effective field per unpaired electron in atomic unit . according to freeman and watson ,  @xcite the value of @xmath86 is calculated to be 2.34 for the free mn@xmath34 ion , by taking into account the contributions from three inner electron spins ( 1@xmath87 , 2@xmath87 , and 3@xmath87 ) .",
    "the minus sign in @xmath77 indicates that the direction of @xmath77 is opposite to the magnetic moment .",
    "thus for the free mn@xmath34 ion , the values of @xmath77 is estimated to be @xmath88 t .",
    "the effect of the admixture of the higher triplet state to ground - state and distorted crystalline field may be extremely small .",
    "in fact , for the diluted ion in the trigonal symmetry , the hyperfine anisotropy is of the order of 0.1% .",
    "it is noted that the experimental internal field of 21.8 t is smaller by 26% as compared with calculated value of 29.3 t for the free ion .",
    "this is understood by considering a large amount of reduction of the magnetic moment .",
    "the recent polarized neutron diffraction measurement yields the presence of 22% reduction from the full value of 3@xmath89 in the magnitude of the mn@xmath34 magnetic moment .",
    "@xcite since the reduction of the magnetic moment due to 3@xmath90-electrons reflects the contact term , the present result is consistent with the neutron results .",
    "such a large amount of reduction may be ascribed to the presence of the covalence and strong exchange interactions , as observed usually in the condensed matter .    on the other hand ,",
    "the ground state of the mn@xmath35 ion ( 3d@xmath82 , @xmath91d ) is orbital doublet denoted by @xmath92 in the cubic crystalline field . as in the case of mn@xmath80 ion , the fermi - contact field @xmath93",
    "is obtained for the free mn@xmath70 to be 48.5 t using the calculated value of @xmath86=2.91 .",
    "@xcite because of the additional elongated tetragonal symmetry of the crystalline field caused by jahn - teller effect and low - symmetric carboxylate ligands , the orbital degeneracy is removed to the lower and higher states with the wave functions expressed as @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "here we defined the rectangular coordinate system ( @xmath96 ) with the tetragonal @xmath97-axis and the @xmath98-axis along one of the principal axes in the tetragonal plane .",
    "further , the orthorhombic distortion of the crystalline field gives rise to the admixture of @xmath99 to @xmath100 , thus the ground - state wave - function being expressed as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are normalization factors . in mn(2 ) and mn(3 ) , the @xmath97-axis tilts from the @xmath104-axis by the angles of @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively . in the case of mn@xmath35 ion , the dipolar term in eq .",
    "[ eq : two ] contributes appreciably to the hyperfine tensor in addition to the dominant isotropic fermi - contact term . by using the wave function @xmath107 in the standard operator - equivalent method , the dipolar hamiltonian @xmath108=@xmath109@xmath31@xmath78 , which is expressed in terms of the principal terms with respect to the ( @xmath96 )",
    "coordinate system , is given as , @xmath110 \\label{eq : four}\\ ] ] with @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the average for the orbital radius @xmath113 with respect to 3@xmath90 shell .",
    "it is useful to define the ( @xmath114 ) rectangular coordinate system with the @xmath53-axis along the magnetic moment and the @xmath115-axis is taken in the @xmath116-plane .",
    "( see fig . 4 in ref .",
    "then the above equation is expressed as  @xcite @xmath117 with @xmath118 the principal terms are anisotropic , and there appear the off - diagonal terms .",
    "for the free mn@xmath35 ion which has @xmath119 ,  @xcite @xmath120",
    "is evaluated to be @xmath5117.1 t .",
    "the orbital contribution is in general evaluated from the equation , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 represents the deviation of the @xmath123-value from @xmath124 due to admixture of the higher excited orbital state . applying the value of @xmath125 and @xmath126 for mn@xmath35 ion evaluated from high field epr measurement ,  @xcite the value of @xmath127 is calculated , using @xmath128 for the free ion , to be about 2 t .",
    "so , we may neglect the orbital contribution as compared with the other terms . by taking into account the dipolar contribution to the internal field , which is given by the @xmath129 component in the dipolar tensor @xmath49 ( eq .  ) , the total internal field is given by @xmath130 the identification of the l2 and l3 lines was made in view of eq .",
    "( [ eq : six ] ) . by considering that the increase in @xmath131 plays a role to deduce @xmath132 as far as @xmath133",
    ", it turns out that the line l2 with lower @xmath17 should be due to mn(2 ) , and thus the l3 line being due to mn(3 ) . as for the quadrupole",
    "splitting , the dominant term is expressed , for the axial - symmetry case , as @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the quadrupole - splitting parameter",
    ". the larger value of @xmath131 yields the larger splitting as far as @xmath133 .",
    "the above identification is then consistent with the observed difference in quadrupole splitting between @xmath2mn nmr for the l2 and l3 lines .",
    "the determination of the components of the hyperfine tensors @xmath74 for mn(2 ) and mn(3 ) of mn@xmath35 ion was made in the following way .",
    "there are three unknown factors , the reduction factor for the contact term , the value of @xmath112 , and the amount of the mixing of the two wave functions in the ground - state @xmath92 , which is represented by the factor @xmath136 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : five ] ) . according to ref .",
    ", the reductions of the magnetic moments for the mn(2 ) and mn(3 ) ions are obtained to be 8% and 6% , respectively . first , by applying these reduction factors to the value of @xmath112 in eq .   for each ion , we evaluated that @xmath120=@xmath5115.7 and @xmath51 16.0 t , respectively . secondly , referring to the crystal parameters given in ref .",
    ", we assumed the tetragonal and orthorhombic symmetries of the crystalline field for mn(2 ) and mn(3 ) , respectively .",
    "that is , we put @xmath137 for mn(2 ) , and the coefficient @xmath136 for mn(3 ) was remained as an unknown factor .",
    "then using @xmath138 for mn(2 ) , we obtain the dipolar contribution @xmath139+@xmath140 t . using the experimental value of 26.5 t for @xmath141 in eq .  , we find @xmath142(mn(2))=24.8 t .",
    "this corresponds to 85% of @xmath141 for the free ion , thus reduction factor for the contact term being evaluated to be 15% .",
    "next we adopted the same value of the contact field for mn(3 ) .",
    "then using @xmath143 , the mixing parameter for mn(3 ) was estimated to be @xmath144 . from the above considerations , we finally determined the following numerical values of the components of the @xmath2mn hyperfine - interaction tensors for each of three manganese ions , which are expressed in unit of mhz with respect to the ( @xmath114)-coordinate frame with the @xmath53-axis of the @xmath4-axis ;    [ eq : atensor ] @xmath145",
    "the transverse and longitudinal relaxation times @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the @xmath2mn were measured for the three resonance lines at the liq.helium temperatures with the external field @xmath54 up to 9 t applied along the @xmath4-axis , and for the l1 line the measurement was extended down to 200mk in zero field .",
    "figure  [ fig : specfield ] shows the field dependence of the resonance frequencies of the central peaks of the three resonance lines , which was obtained at 1.65k by applying the external field @xmath54 along the @xmath4-axis ( @xmath53-axis ) after zero - field cooling . within the experimental error ,",
    "the slopes of these lines coincide with the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath146 of the free manganese nuclei . as explained in sec .",
    "[ subsec : hit ] , the internal field @xmath141 of @xmath2mn , which is mainly due to the fermi - contact term , appears along the spin direction , that is , opposite to the magnetic moment .",

    "however , in the present case , it was difficult to attain complete saturation of the nmr signal because of the broadness of each quadrupole splitting resonance line .",

    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) , that @xmath11 exhibits very remarkable temperature dependence , whereas @xmath12 remains almost constant with the relation such that @xmath15 .",
    "then , the effective fluctuation at each of the @xmath2mn sites is regarded to be step - wise , and it is characterized by random sudden jumps between the ground - sate and the excited state , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "@xmath169 ( @xmath170 or @xmath171 ) is the average magnitude of the effective fluctuating field along or perpendicular to the @xmath53-axis .",

    "this problem has been treated by kohmoto _",

    ".   corresponds to the expression obtained on the basis of the standard perturbation method , that is , the weak collision regime . on the other hand , eq .",
    "means that the relaxation rate is determined solely by the average number of the appearance of the thermal excitation per one second , and further it does not depend on the magnitude of the fluctuating field .",
    "this is the strong collision regime . as evaluated above , in the present experimental conditions , the temperature dependence of @xmath5 results predominantly through the term of @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , as far as the temperature dependence is concerned , there is no appreciable difference between both regimes for @xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , since the term of @xmath187 in @xmath11 and @xmath12 contributes to the field dependence of @xmath5 , the qualitative difference between eqs .   and   is expected to appear in the field dependence of @xmath5 .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to look at the qualitative field dependence of @xmath0 to find the plausible regime .",
    "the field - dependence of the relevant terms of @xmath11 and @xmath188 calculated for t=1.45k are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates - hdep ] by the solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "clearly the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates - hdep ] , which represents @xmath181 , explains well the corresponding experimental curve given in fig .",

    "this means that the strong - collision regime is valid . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdep ] represents the result for qualitative fitting of the calculated curve of eq .   for zero field to the experimental temperature dependence of @xmath5 .",
    "it should be noted that there appears no definite dependence of @xmath5 on the site of the manganese nuclei , although there exists rather large difference in the @xmath189 component of the hyperfine tensor as estimated in the previous section ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : atensor ] ) ) .",
    "this is well understood if we adopt eq .  .",

    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : compfdep ] represents the fitted curve of eq .  .",
    "in both cases of the temperature and field dependence of @xmath5 , the agreements are satisfactory .",
    "thus it is concluded that the transverse relaxation is essentially determined by the phase disturbance associated with the average number of the appearance of the first excited state per one second ( strong collision regime ) .",
    "now let us turn to the longitudinal relaxation rate .",
    "if we pay attention to the experimental fact that @xmath190 together with the validity of eq .  , it is reasonable to assume that the longitudinal relaxation time @xmath1 is much longer than the characteristic times @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "then , the longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath6 should be obtained , following to the conventional perturbation theory , by the spectral component at the @xmath2mn larmor frequency @xmath17 of the time correlation function for the step - wise fluctuating field as given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluc ] .",
    "the time correlation function for such a fluctuating field is easily calculated to be @xmath191 with @xmath192 and @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the correlation time .",
    "the approximation used in eqs .",

    "as in the case of @xmath5 , the temperature dependence of @xmath6 is almost determined by @xmath11 , while the field dependence depends not only on @xmath11 but also on @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath6 is determined by @xmath202 for the low - frequency limit @xmath203 , and by @xmath204 for the high - frequency limit @xmath205 .",
    "the dotted line in fig .  [ fig : rates - hdep ] represents the field dependence of @xmath204 calculated for @xmath206k .",
    "it is found that the experimental field dependence obtained for @xmath206k fits well the dotted line , but not the dashed line , thus suggesting the validity of the equation for the high - frequency limit instead of the other .",
    "the dot - dashed and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdep ] represent the results of the best fitting of the curve @xmath181 for zero field to the experimental results for temperature dependence for the l1-line ( mn@xmath34 ion ) and the l2-line ( mn@xmath35 ion ) .",
    "the agreement is reasonable down to around 0.7k .",
    "the results for the similar fittings for the field dependence of @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdep ] by the solid and dotted lines .",
    "the agreement is also satisfactory .",
    "thus it turns out that the longitudinal relaxation is governed by perturbing effect of the fluctuating field @xmath207 ( weak collision model ) , and then the high - frequency limit for the @xmath17 component of the correlation function of @xmath207 holds .",
    "it should be noted that the slight difference in the field dependence between @xmath5 and @xmath6 results from the presence of the factor @xmath208 in the latter , which is approximated as ( @xmath209 ) for @xmath210 .",
    "first we examine the above treatment numerically . the use of @xmath0 yields directly the value of @xmath11 .",
    "then we obtain the constant for the spin - phonon interaction , @xmath211s@xmath9k@xmath212 , which lies reasonably in the range of the value of 10@xmath213s@xmath9k@xmath212predicted in ref .  .",
    "using this value , we obtain @xmath214s . here",
    "if we tentatively assume that the deviation of the cluster spin of @xmath215=1 during @xmath12 is shared by the 12 manganese spins , the average deviation of each spin is taken to be @xmath216 . then , for instance , the use of @xmath217mhz for mn@xmath34 ion yields @xmath21825 , thus the condition for the strong collision regime for @xmath5 relaxation process being satisfied .",
    "the reason why there appears above about 2k the slight difference in the value of @xmath5 between mn@xmath34 and mn@xmath35 ions might be due to the cross - over from the strong - collision regime to the weak collision regime . in fact , in the latter , the difference in the coupling constant term , that is , @xmath219 or @xmath220 should reflects in the value of @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , as far as we are confined ourselves within the present simplified treatment , it is not realized because @xmath12 is almost temperature - independent .",
    "as for @xmath1 , for instance , using the evaluated value of @xmath221mhz ( mn(2 ) ) and 53mhz ( mn(3 ) ) , we obtain @xmath222 and @xmath223 , respectively , which agrees reasonably with the experimental result in relative order of magnitude . however , the following points remain not understood .",
    "first , as far as the hyperfine interaction for mn@xmath34 ion is taken to be isotropic and not to have off - diagonal terms as determined in the present analysis of the nmr spectra , it is difficult to understand that the relaxation rate for mn@xmath34 ion is of comparable order with that for mn@xmath35 ion . in order to understand the experimental results for @xmath1 for mn@xmath34 ion , the assumption of the presence of any off - diagonal term of the hyperfine interaction tensor will be necessary . unless the anisotropic term is not effective , the possible relaxation mechanism may be inevitably ascribed to the isotropic interaction term like @xmath224@xmath225@xmath226 as in the case of the three - magnon relaxation process in usual magnetic system . in this case",
    ", the relevant activation energy which determines the temperature dependence of @xmath1 should be at least twice of the gap energy so as to guarantee the energy conservation between the nuclear spin and the electronic spin system .",
    "however , in the cluster which involves only twelve electronic spins coupled strongly to each other by exchange interactions , it may be quite unreliable .",
    "anyhow , the origin of the effective coupling constant for @xmath1 for mn@xmath34 ion is uncertain at the present .",
    "next we discuss on the present concept for obtaining the relevant equations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as a starting point we considered only the two lowest levels , the ground - state and the first excited state .",
    "then , if we follow the standard stochastic theory , the fluctuating local field responsible for the nuclear magnetic relaxation , which is caused by the thermal excitation to the excited state from the ground - state , is treated as a perturbation with respect to the nuclear quantization axis . in the cases of zero field and where the external field is applied along the c - axis , the nuclear quantization axis is taken to be along the internal field at the @xmath2mn site , that is , along the @xmath4-axis .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates are given by the fourier spectrum of correlation function of such a fluctuating local field @xmath227 ( @xmath170 or @xmath171 ) at the resonance frequency @xmath17 as follows : @xmath228 with @xmath229 as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : an ] , the correlation function for the pulse - like field given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluc ] , is calculated to have the exponential - typed form given by eq .  .",
    "the longitudinal relaxation rate has already been given by eq .  .",
    "on the other hand , we have found experimentally that @xmath190 .",
    "so @xmath18 should be ascribed to the zero - frequency term @xmath230 , which is given by @xmath231 according to this equation , the temperature dependence of @xmath5 results only from @xmath11 as far as @xmath15 because @xmath12 is taken to be almost independent on the temperature .",
    "however , the value of @xmath5 should have a large site - dependence through the coupling constant term @xmath232 , which is proportional to the hyperfine interaction term of @xmath233 .",
    "furthermore , as already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates - hdep ] , the field dependence of @xmath202 differs from that of only @xmath181 .",
    "such features contradict with our experimental results . instead",
    ", as we have already mentioned , the equation like @xmath14 obtained as a strong collision regime on the basis of more basic treatment explains satisfactorily our experimental results for @xmath0 .",
    "finally , with respect to the longitudinal relaxation , we compare our present formalism with the equation adopted by furukawa _",
    "et al_. in ref .  .",
    "they have taken into account all of the 21 energy levels ( @xmath234 ) of @xmath10 as the candidates for the fluctuating field @xmath235 responsible for the nuclear magnetic relaxation .",
    "then , it has been assumed that the correlation functions associated with each of these energy levels are the exponential - typed one with the correlation time equal to the corresponding average life time , which is determined by the spin - phonon interaction as discussed in ref .  .",
    "the contributions from each level have been summed up with the statistical weight .",
    "however , in considering the low temperature results , only the term related to the lowest ground - state with @xmath236 with the predominant statistical weight was remained as an effective one , thus yielding the expression like @xmath237 in the high - frequency limit for @xmath238 . as is seen",
    ", our equation   has the same form as this equation .",
    "however , the origins of each term are different . first , in eq .",
    ", the term @xmath11 results from the effective amplitude of the fluctuating field @xmath239 in the correlation function .",
    "secondly the criterion for the high - frequency limit , which brings the term @xmath17 in the equation , is taken with respect to @xmath240 instead of @xmath241 .",
    "thirdly , as for the coupling constant , eq .   involves the transverse fluctuating field @xmath242 , that is , the off - diagonal term @xmath243 , since it is assumed that the the anisotropic perturbing interaction like @xmath244 is responsible for the nuclear spin lattice relaxation .",
    "while , in ref .  , the coupling constants for mn(1 ) , mn(2 ) , and mn(3 ) have been taken to be proportional to the square of the internal static field in zero field , _",
    "i. e. _ , square of @xmath189 in our notation .",
    "then , in view of the large difference of the ratio of the coupling constants of @xmath19 for the three ions between experimental values and the above estimation , the presence of the coupling constants for non - zero mode have been suggested .",
    "unfortunately the @xmath2mn nmr signal is observable only at low temperatures .",
    "so it is difficult to find experimentally the maximum point of the relaxation rate which appears in the bpp - typed equation under the condition @xmath245 . it may be possible for other nuclei with much lower resonance frequency",
    "however , such a condition is realized at rather high temperatures . in this case",
    ", the present two - level model may fail .",
    "further extension of the present treatment will be necessary by taking into account the higher excited levels .",
    "the nuclear magnetic relaxation times @xmath0 and @xmath1 of @xmath2mn for mn@xmath34 and mn@xmath35 ions in mn@xmath3ac have been measured using the oriented powder sample at low temperatures below 2.5k down to 200mk in the fields up to 9 t applied along @xmath4-axis .",
    "the relaxation rates @xmath5 and @xmath6 in zero field exhibited remarkable decreases with decreasing temperature with the relative relation like @xmath246 at the temperatures above about 1.5k . at the lower temperatures the difference was more pronounced .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath18 and @xmath19 showed decrease with increasing field for the cluster whose magnetic moment is parallel to the @xmath4-axis . on the contrary , those for the cluster whose magnetic moment is antiparallel to the @xmath4-axis increase with increasing field .",
    "the analysis for the experimental results was made on the concept that the nuclear magnetic relaxation is caused by thermal excitations of the cluster spin .",
