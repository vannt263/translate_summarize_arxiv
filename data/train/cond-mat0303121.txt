    "macroscopic effects of superconductivity are investigated using the ginzburg - landau(gl ) phenomenological model@xcite for the free energy of the superconducting state characterized by a complex order parameter @xmath10 and two parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these parameter are , respectively , coefficients of the linear superconducting(sc ) pair density term @xmath13 and the quadratic pair interaction term @xmath14 .",
    "a variational process leads to coupled gl differential equations that characterize a minimum free energy state that depends on the surface energy density through additional parameters . in almost all cases",
    "the source of an applied magnetic field or a current is externally controllable and the free energy is of the gibbs form .",
    "quantized magnetic levitation@xcite is an exceptional , fundamental example of a nano - magneto - mechanical device , whose analysis requires the use of the helmholtz free energy .",
    "this article deals with the gibbs free energy and the anomalous superconductivity induced by externally controlled surface energy . since our hamiltonian functional differs from the standard gl functional , and since unexpected phenomena arising from the surface energy , the article is written in a self - contained format with all relations derived from our energy functional .    in the absence of surface effects",
    ", the pair interaction parameter @xmath12 must be positive in order to have an energy minimum and a concomitant sc state .",
    "the surface boundary condition of the superconducting order parameter modifies the free energy density near the surface on the scale of the coherence length . for sample dimensions of @xmath15 and larger",
    ", boundary conditions do not contribute significantly to the total free energy .",
    "however , for a sc sample , assumed to be uniform and homogeneous , with relevant dimensions of @xmath16 and smaller , the total free energy can be significantly altered by boundary effects .",
    "for a weakly superconducting surface , considered previously @xcite , the surface energy term added to the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy , has the form @xmath17 , where the integral is extended over the sample surface , and @xmath18 is a characteristic length . when @xmath19 , the overall free energy is lowered and an increase of the transition temperature above the bulk value @xmath20 is possible@xcite . if @xmath21 , the free energy is increased and the nucleation temperature is lowered relative to @xmath20 . in the weak sc surface limit , the sample is superconducting only if @xmath12 is positive .",
    "if the surface is strongly superconducting , the surface energy has an additional sc pair interaction term @xmath22 , with @xmath23 a characteristic length . for @xmath24 , we show that the entire sample may be in an anomalous superconducting state with @xmath12 negative . we also show that the minimum free energy explicitly depends on @xmath23 ; whereas the dependence on @xmath18 is only implicit through @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath23 essentially determines whether a particular solution of the differential gl equations represents a physical sc state , or whether it is merely a mathematical solution .    to account for the spatial variation of @xmath10 , the conventional gl energy functional includes the term @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the momentum operator . in this study",
    "we introduce a hamiltonian with the complete kinetic energy density @xmath28 , or @xmath29 is used to keep track of the difference between the @xmath30 model and the standard gl model . in view of the divergence operation ,",
    "the additional term is a surface term .",
    "the imaginary part of the divergence term is identically zero , but the real part changes the surface boundary conditions , and hence the character of the order parameter throughout the sample volume .",
    "it is shown that the real part of the divergence term in the @xmath30 model destroys superconductivity unless the surface energy is augmented by a term @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a constant .",
    "furthermore , a second order phase transition is possible only if @xmath33 , and the transition temperature is higher for @xmath33 than for any value of @xmath34 . for @xmath35 sc states do not exist for small values of the order parameter",
    "; however , first order phase transitions may exist .",
    "in the gl theory @xmath11 and @xmath12 are arbitrary parameters , assumed to be functions of the reduced temperature @xmath36 .",
    "however , the explicit temperature dependence of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is not given and thus has to be conjectured from experiments .",
    "since we do not want to assume _ a priori _ an explicit temperature dependence , we first investigate the solutions of the gl equations consistent with the boundary conditions , independent of specific temperature models for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "for one dimensional systems with a uniform current density j , all possible physical solutions of the gl equations , with sgn@xmath37 and sgn@xmath38 are found , and categorized .",
    "these solutions are then applied to a plane slab sc sample and the influence of the surface energy parameters @xmath18 and @xmath23 on the sample order parameter is studied , and unusual sc states , including `` pre - wetting '' surface states , are analyzed .",
    "critical currents are shown as functions of @xmath9 .",
    "a temperature model is introduced for the fundamental ratio @xmath39 to illustrate possible enhancement or reduction of the critical temperature .",
    "finally , the critical current of a superconductor - normal - superconductor ( sns ) layered system is calculated , and the results with @xmath40 are shown to be in excellent agreement with critical current experiments.@xcite",
    "as originally formulated by ginzburg and landau@xcite , the free energy of a superconductor in a magnetic field @xmath41 is a function of a coordinate dependent complex order parameter @xmath42 and the vector potential @xmath43 .",
    "we begin our development with a general energy functional @xmath44 that encompasses a broad spectrum of models , including those leading to the stationary states of the schrdinger equation and the gl equations for sc .",

    "it is shown below that the @xmath57 term is necessary for a sc state to exist , and the value of c determines whether a sc state exists and whether a phase transition to the sc state is first or second order .",
