    "material interfaces in hybrid structures give rise to proximity effects , whereby the properties of one material can `` leak '' into the adjacent material , creating a region with properties derived from both materials . in superconductor / ferromagnet ( sf ) hybrid structures @xcite ,",
    "the proximity effect causes superconducting correlations to penetrate into the ferromagnetic region and vice versa .",
    "these correlations typically decay over short distances , which in diffusive systems is of the order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the diffusion coefficient of the ferromagnet and @xmath4 is the strength of the exchange field .",
    "however , for certain field configurations , the singlet correlations from the superconductor may be converted into so - called long - range triplets ( lrts ) @xcite .",
    "these triplet components have spin projection parallel to the exchange field , and decay over much longer distances .",
    "this results in physical quantities like supercurrents decaying over the length scale @xmath5 , which is usually much larger than the ferromagnetic coherence length @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the temperature .",
    "this distance is independent of @xmath4 , and at low temperatures it becomes increasingly large , which allows the condensate to penetrate deep into the ferromagnet .",
    "the isolation and enhancement of this feature has attracted much attention in recent years as it gives rise to novel physics and possible low - temperature applications by merging spintronics and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "it is by now well - known that the conversion from singlet to long - range triplet components of the superconducting state can happen in the presence of magnetic inhomogeneities @xcite , _ i.e. _ a spatially varying exchange field , and until recently such inhomogeneities were believed to be the primary source of this conversion @xcite , although other proposals using _",
    "e.g. _ non - equilibrium distribution functions and intrinsic triplet superconductors also exist @xcite .",
    "however , it has recently been established that another possible source of lrt correlations is the presence of a finite spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , either in the superconducting region @xcite or on the ferromagnetic side @xcite .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that an sf structure where the magnetic inhomogeneity is due to a bloch domain wall , as considered in _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    ", is gauge equivalent to one where the ferromagnet has a homogeneous exchange field and intrinsic so coupling@xcite .",
    "it is known that so scattering can be caused by impurities@xcite , but this type of scattering results in purely isotropic spin - relaxation , and so does not permit the desired singlet - lrt conversion . to achieve such a conversion , one needs a rotation of the spin pair into the direction of the exchange field @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by using materials with an intrinsic so coupling , either due to the crystal structure in the case of noncentrosymmetric materials@xcite , or due to interfaces in thin - film hybrids@xcite , where the latter also modifies the fundamental process of andreev reflection @xcite .",
    "the role of so coupling with respect to the supercurrent in ballistic hybrid structures has also been studied recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we establish how the presence of spin - orbit coupling in sf structures manifests in two important experimental observables : the density of states  @xmath8 probed via tunneling spectroscopy ( or conductance measurements ) , and the critical temperature  @xmath1 .",
    "a common consequence for both of these quantities is that neither becomes independent of the magnetization direction .",
    "this is in contrast to the case without so coupling in conventional monodomain ferromagnets , where the results are invariant with respect to rotations of the magnetic exchange field .",
    "this symmetry is now lifted due to so coupling : depending on the magnetization direction , lrt cooper pairs are created in the system which leave clear fingerprints both spectroscopically and in terms of the @xmath1 behavior . on the technical side",
    ", we will present in this work for the first time a riccati parametrization of the usadel equation and its corresponding boundary conditions that include so coupling .",
    "this is an important advance in terms of exploring the full physics of triplet pairing due to so coupling as it allows for a solution of the quasiclassical equations without any assumption of a weak proximity effect .",
    "we will also demonstrate that the so coupling can actually protect the singlet superconducting correlations even in the presence of a strong exchange field , leading to the possibility of a minigap that is magnetically tunable via the orientation of the exchange field .",
    "the remainder of the article will be organised as follows : in section [ sec : theory ] , we introduce the relevant theory and notation , starting from the quasiclassical usadel equation , which describes the diffusion of the superconducting condensate into the ferromagnet .",
    "we also motivate our choice of intrinsic so coupling in this section , and propose a new notation for describing rashba ",
    "dresselhaus couplings .",
    "the section goes on to discuss key analytic features of the equations in the limit of weak proximity , symmetries of the density of states at zero energy , and analytical results needed to calculate the critical temperature of hybrid systems .",
    "we then present detailed numerical results in section  [ sec : results ] : we analyze the density of states of an sf bilayer in [ subsec : sf ] [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) ] , with the case of pure rashba coupling considered in section  [ subsec : purer ] , and we study the sfs josephson junction in [ subsec : sfs ] [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : model](b ) ] .",
    "we consider different orientations and strengths of the exchange field and so coupling , and in the case of the josephson junction , the effect of altering the phase difference between the condensates .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : results - tc ] , we continue our treatment of the sf  bilayer in the full proximity regime by including a self - consistent solution in the superconducting layer , and focus on how the presence of so coupling affects the critical temperature of the system .",
    "we discover that the so coupling allows for spin - valve functionality with a single ferromagnetic layer , meaning that rotating the magnetic field by @xmath9 induces a large change in @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : disc ] with a summary of the main results , a discussion of some additional consequences of the choices made in - text , as well as possibilities for further work .",
    "the diffusion of the superconducting condensate into the ferromagnet can be described by the usadel equation , which is a second - order partial differential equation for the green s function of the system@xcite .",
    "together with appropriate boundary conditions , the usadel equation establishes a system of coupled differential equations that can be solved in one dimension .",
    "we will consider the case of diffusive equilibrium , where the retarded component @xmath10 of the green s function is sufficient to describe the behaviour of the system @xcite .",

    "so coupling in the context of quasiclassical theory has also been discussed in refs .  .",

    "( [ eqn : sousadel ] ) .",
    "similarly , the boundary conditions in eq .   become : @xmath49 and the @xmath48 counterparts are found in the same way as before . for the details of these derivations ,",
    "see appendix  [ app : riccati ] .",
    "we will now discuss the definition of current in the presence of spin - orbit interactions .",
    "since the hamiltonian including so coupling contains terms linear in momentum ( see below ) , the velocity operator @xmath50 is affected .",
    "we stated above that the kupriyanov - lukichev boundary conditions are simply modified by replacing the derivative with its gauge covariant counterpart including the so interaction .",
    "to make sure that current conservation is still satisfied , we must carefully examine the usadel equation . in the absence of so coupling , the quasiclassical expression for electric current",
    "is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the @xmath53 green s function matrix in keldysh space @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a constant that is not important for this discussion .",
    "current conservation can now be proven from the usadel equation itself .",
    "we show this for the case of equilibrium , which is relevant for the case of supercurrents in josephson junctions . in this case",

    "thus , we are left with @xmath60 which expresses precisely current conservation since the same analysis can be done for @xmath61 .",
    "now , let us include the so coupling .",
    "the current should then be given by @xmath62 so that the expression for the charge current is modified by the presence of so coupling , as is known .",

    "the precise form of the generic so field @xmath66 is imposed by the experimental requirements and limitations .",
    "as the name suggests , spin - orbit coupling couples a particle s spin with its motion , and more specifically its momentum .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the so coupling in solids can originate from a lack of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure .",
    "such spin - orbit coupling can be of both rashba and dresselhaus type and is determined by the point group symmetry of the crystal @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the lack of inversion symmetry due to surfaces , either in the form of interfaces to other materials or to vacuum , will give rise to antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling of the rashba type . for sufficiently thin structures ,",
    "the so coupling generated in this way can permeate the entire structure , but the question of precisely how far into adjacent materials such surface - so coupling may penetrate appears to be an open question in general .",
    "intrinsic inversion asymmetry arises naturally due to interfaces between materials in thin - film hybrid structures such as the ones considered herein .",
    "noncentrosymmetric crystalline structures provide an alternative source for intrinsic asymmetry , and are considered in ref .  .",
    "in thin - film hybrids , the rashba spin splitting derives from the cross product of the pauli vector @xmath67 with the momentum @xmath68 , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is called the rashba coefficient , and we have chosen a coordinate system with @xmath71 as the layering direction",
    ". another well - known type of so coupling is the dresselhaus spin splitting , which can occur when the crystal structure lacks an inversion centre .",
    "for a two - dimensional electron gas ( quantum well ) confined in the @xmath72-direction , then to first order @xmath73 , so the dresselhaus splitting becomes @xmath74 where @xmath75 is called the dresselhaus coefficient . in our structure , we consider a thin - film geometry with the confinement being strongest in the @xmath29-direction .",
    "although there may certainly be other terms contributing to the dresselhaus so coupling in such a structure , since real thin - film structures will have three - dimensional quasiparticle diffusion and we use a @xmath76 form of the so coupling here , we consider the standard form eq .",
    "( [ eq : dhaus ] ) as an approximation that captures the main physics in the problem .",
    "this is a commonly used model in the literature to explore the effects originating from so coupling in a system .",
    "when we combine both interactions , we obtain the hamiltonian for a general rashba ",
    "dresselhaus so coupling , @xmath77 in this work , we will restrict ourselves to this form of so coupling .",
    "it should be noted that our setup may also be viewed as a simplified model for a scenario where the so coupling and ferromagnetism exist in separate , thin layers , in which case we expect qualitatively similar results to the ones reported in this manuscript .    as explained in ref .",
    ", the so coupling acts as a background su(2 ) field , _ i.e. _ an object with both a vector structure in geometric space , and a @xmath78 matrix structure in spin space .",
    "we can therefore identify the interaction above with an effective vector potential @xmath66 which we will call the _ so field _",
    ", @xmath79 from which we derive that @xmath80    at this point , it is convenient to introduce a new notation for describing rashba  dresselhaus couplings , which will let us distinguish between the physical effects that derive from the strength of the coupling , and those that derive from the geometry . for this purpose ,",
    "we employ polar notation defined by the relations @xmath81 where we will refer to @xmath82 as the _ so strength _ , and @xmath83 as the _",
    "so angle_. rewritten in the polar notation , eq",
    ".   takes the form : @xmath84 from the definition , we can immediately conclude that @xmath85 corresponds to a pure dresselhaus coupling , while @xmath86 results in a pure rashba coupling , with the geometric interpretation of @xmath83 illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : soc - geometry ] . note that @xmath87 , which means that @xmath88 .",
    "another useful property is that we can switch the components @xmath89 by letting @xmath90 .",

    "recall that the lrt components are defined as having spin projections parallel to the exchange field , as opposed to the short - ranged triplet ( srt ) component which appears as long as there is exchange splitting@xcite but has spin projection perpendicular to the field and is therefore subject to the same pair - breaking effect as the singlets@xcite , penetrating only a very short distance into strong ferromagnets .",

    "however , the effect of so coupling becomes increasingly significant for angles close to @xmath102 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dosangle ] in section  [ subsec : sf ] ) .",
    "we also see that no lrts can be generated for in - plane magnetization in the special case @xmath103 and @xmath104 , since @xmath105 can then be rewritten as @xmath106 , which is parallel to @xmath107 .",
    "there is no lrt generation for the case @xmath108 and @xmath109 for similar reasons . in general",
    "however , the lrt will appear for an in - plane magnetization as long as @xmath110 and the so coupling is not of pure dresselhaus or pure rashba type .",
    "it is also important to note that the lrt can be created even for pure rashba type so coupling if the magnetization has both in- and out - of - plane magnetization components .",
    "we will discuss precisely this situation in sec .",
    "[ subsec : purer ] .",
    "once the condition for long - range triplet generation is satisfied , increasing the corresponding exchange field will also increase the proportion of long - range triplets compared with short - range triplets .",
    "whether or not the presence of long - range triplets can be observed in the system , _",
    "i.e. _ if they retain a clear signature in measurable quantities such as the density of states when the criteria for their existence is fulfilled , depends on other aspects such as the strength of the spin - orbit coupling and will be discussed later in this paper .",
    "_ thus , a main motivation for this work is to take a step further than discussing their existence @xcite and instead make predictions for when long - ranged triplet cooper pairs can actually be observed via spectroscopic or @xmath1 measurements in sf structures with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "_ however , we will also demonstrate that the presence of so coupling offers additional opportunities besides the creation of lrt cooper pairs .",
    "we will show both analytically and numerically that the so coupling can protect the singlet component even in the presence of an exchange field , which normally would suppress it .",
    "this provides the possibility of tuning the well - known minigap _ magnetically _ , both in bilayer and josephson junctions , simply by altering the direction of the magnetization .      in order to establish a better analytical understanding of the role played by so coupling in the system before presenting the spectroscopy and @xmath1 results",
    ", we will now consider the limit of weak proximity effect , which means that @xmath111 , @xmath112 in the ferromagnet .",
    "the anomalous green s function in general is given by the upper - right block of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gr ] ) , @xmath113 , which we see reduces to @xmath114 in this limit .",
    "it will also prove prudent to express the anomalous green s function using a singlet / triplet decomposition , where the singlet component is described by a scalar function @xmath115 , and the triplet components encapsulated in the so - called @xmath116-vector@xcite , @xmath117 combining the above with the weak proximity identity @xmath114 , we see that the components of @xmath118 can be rewritten as : @xmath119    under spin rotations , the singlet component @xmath115 will then transform as a scalar , while the triplet component @xmath120 transforms as an ordinary vector .",
    "another useful feature of this notation is that it becomes almost trivial to distinguish between short - range and long - range triplet components ; the projection @xmath121 along the exchange field corresponds to the srts , while the perpendicular part @xmath122 describes the lrts , where @xmath123 here denotes the unit vector of the exchange field . for a concrete example",
    ", if the exchange field is oriented along the @xmath29-axis , then @xmath124 will be the short - range component , while both @xmath125 and @xmath126 are long - ranged components . in the coming sections",
    ", we will demonstrate that the lrt component can be identified from its density of states signature , as measurable by tunneling spectroscopy .    in the limit of weak proximity effect",
    ", we may linearize both the usadel equation and kupriyanov  lukichev boundary conditions . using the singlet / triplet decomposition in eq .  , and the rashba  dresselhaus coupling in eq .",
    ", the linearized version of the usadel equation can be written : @xmath127 where we for brevity have defined an so interaction matrix @xmath128 we have now condensed the usadel equation down to two coupled differential equations for @xmath115 and @xmath129 , where the coupling is proportional to the exchange field and the so interaction term .",
    "the latter has been written as a product of a factor @xmath130 , depending on the strength  @xmath82 , and a factor @xmath131 , depending on the angle @xmath83 in the polar notation .",
    "the matrix @xmath132 becomes diagonal for a dresselhaus coupling with @xmath85 or a rashba coupling with @xmath101 , which implies that there is no triplet mixing for such systems .",
    "in contrast , the off - diagonal terms are maximal for @xmath133 , which suggests that the triplet mixing is maximal when the rashba and dresselhaus coefficients have the same magnitude .",
    "in addition to the off - diagonal triplet mixing terms , we see that the diagonal terms of @xmath132 essentially result in imaginary energy contributions @xmath130 .",
    "as we will see later , this can in some cases result in a suppression of all the triplet components in the ferromagnet",
    ".    we will now consider exchange fields in the @xmath30-plane , @xmath134 since the linearized usadel equations show that the presence of a singlet component @xmath115 only results in the generation of triplet components along @xmath107 , and the so interaction term only mixes the triplet components in the @xmath30-plane , the only nonzero triplet components will in this case be @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",

    "if we start with only a singlet component @xmath115 , then the presence of an exchange field @xmath4 results in the generation of the srt component @xmath135 .",
    "the presence of an so field can then result in the generation of the lrt component @xmath136 , where the mixing term is proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "this implies that in the weak proximity limit , lrt mixing is absent for an exchange field direction @xmath142 , corresponding to @xmath143 , while it is maximized if @xmath144 and at the same time @xmath133 . in other words ,",
    "the requirement for maximal lrt mixing is therefore that the exchange field is aligned along either the @xmath145-axis or @xmath146-axis , while the rashba and dresselhaus coefficients should have the same magnitude .",
    "it is important to note here that although the mixing between the triplet components is maximal at @xmath144 , this does not necessarily mean that the signature of the triplets in physical quantities is most clearly seen for these angles , as we shall discuss in detail later .",
    "moreover , these equations show another interesting consequence of having an so field in the ferromagnet , which is unrelated to the lrt generation .",
    "note that the effective quasiparticle energies coupling to the srts and lrts become @xmath147 when @xmath148 , then the srts are entirely unaffected by the presence of so coupling ; the triplet mixing term vanishes for these parameters , and @xmath149 is also clearly independent of @xmath82 .",
    "however , when @xmath150 , the situation is drastically different .",
    "there is still no possibility for lrt generation , however the srt energy @xmath151 will now obtain an imaginary energy contribution which destabilizes the srts .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations show that this energy shift destroys the srt components as @xmath82 increases . as we will see in section  [ sec : results - tc ] , this effect results in an increase in the critical temperature of the bilayer .",
    "thus , switching between @xmath152 in a system with @xmath153 may suggest a novel method for creating a triplet spin valve .",
    "when @xmath154 but @xmath155 , the triplet mixing term proportional to @xmath156 will no longer vanish , so we get lrt generation in the system .",
    "we can then see from the effective triplet energies that as @xmath157 , the imaginary part of @xmath149 vanishes , while the imaginary part of @xmath158 increases .",
    "this leads to a relative increase in the amount of srts compared to the amount of lrts in the system .",

    "[ tab : sfs1 ] ) , a useful feature permitting external control of the quasiparticle current flowing through the junction .",
    "the underlying reason is that the phase difference controls the relative ratio of the singlet and triplet correlations : when the singlets dominate , a minigap is induced which mirrors their origin in the bulk superconductor .    as in the bilayer case , there is a resonant condition@xciteindicating an exchange field strength beyond which the minigap can no longer be sustained and increasing the phase difference simply lowers the density of states towards that of the normal metal . amongst the features we outline in the following subsections , one of the effects of adding",

    "the intrinsic so coupling present in the structures considered herein derives from their lack of inversion symmetry due to the _",

    "one way to practically achieve such a setup would be to deposit a very thin layer of a heavy normal metal such as au or pt between a superconductor and a conventional homogeneous ferromagnet .",
    "the combination of the large atomic number @xmath322 and the broken structural inversion symmetry at the interface region would then provide the required so coupling .",
    "with a very thin normal metal layer ( of the order of a couple of nm ) , the proximity effect would be significantly stronger , and thus analysis of this regime is only possible with the full usadel equations in the riccati parameterisation developed herein .",

    "one will increase the relative proportions of long - range to short - range triplets in the middle of the ferromagnet . for strong ferromagnets where the exchange field is a significant fraction of the fermi energy , the quasiclassical usadel formalism may no longer describe the system behaviour appropriately , since it assumes that the impurity scattering rate is much larger than the other energy scales involved , and the eilenberger equation should be used instead @xcite .    in the previous section , we also observed that the presence of so coupling will in many cases _ increase _ the critical temperature of a hybrid structure .",
    "this effect is explained through an increase in the effective energy coupled to the triplet component in the usadel equation , which destabilizes the triplet pairs and closes that proximity channel .",
    "however , for the special geometry @xmath150 , the linearized equations suggest that the srts are unaffected by the presence of so coupling , and this is consistent with the numerical results",
    ". we also note that for the geometries with a large lrt generation , such as @xmath323 and @xmath154 , the lrt generation reduces the critical temperature again .",
    "thus , for the physical parameters considered herein , we see that there is a very slight increase in critical temperature for these geometries , but not as large as for the geometries without lrt generation .",
    "one particularly striking result from the critical temperature calculations is that when the rashba and dresselhaus contribution to the so coupling is of similar magnitude , one observes that the critical temperature can change by as much as 60% upon changing @xmath282 to @xmath324 , _",
    "i.e. _ by a 90@xmath325 rotation of the magnetic field .",

    "<S> we investigate theoretically how the proximity effect in superconductor / ferromagnet hybrid structures with intrinsic spin - orbit coupling manifests in two measurable quantities , namely the density of states and critical temperature . to describe a general scenario , we allow for both rashba and dresselhaus type spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our results are obtained via the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity , extended to include spin - orbit coupling in the usadel equation and kupriyanov  lukichev boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> unlike previous works , we have derived a riccati parametrization of the usadel equation with spin - orbit coupling which allows us to address the full proximity regime and not only the linearized weak proximity regime . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the density of states in both sf  bilayers and sfs  trilayers , where the spectroscopic features in the latter case are sensitive to the phase difference between the two superconductors . we find that the presence of spin - orbit coupling leaves clear spectroscopic fingerprints in the density of states due to its role in creating spin - triplet cooper pairs . unlike sf and sfs structures without spin - orbit coupling , the density of states in the present case depends strongly on the direction of magnetization </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the spin - orbit coupling can stabilize spin - singlet superconductivity even in the presence of a strong exchange field @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the possibility of a magnetically tunable minigap : changing the direction of the exchange field opens and closes the minigap . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine how the critical temperature @xmath1 of an sf bilayer is affected by spin - orbit coupling and , interestingly , demonstrate that one can achieve a spin - valve effect with a single ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath1 displays highly non - monotonic behavior both as a function of the magnetization direction and the type and direction of the spin - orbit coupling , offering a new way to exert control over the superconductivity of proximity structures . </S>"
