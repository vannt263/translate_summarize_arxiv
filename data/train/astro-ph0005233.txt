    "gravitational clustering is the fundamental physical process responsible for the formation and evolution of structure in the universe .",
    "galaxy - hosting dark matter halos are the products of the strongly nonlinear stage of this process , but a detailed understanding of this important regime has mostly eluded us because few numerical simulations have the dynamic range to explore comfortably such a small length scale ( e.g. , moore et al .",

    "the one analytic handle has been the stable clustering assumption ( peebles 1974 ; davis & peebles 1977 ; peebles 1980 ) , which has allowed us to extrapolate into nonlinear regimes beyond the reach of numerical simulations .",
    "predictions of the stable clustering hypothesis are : ( 1 ) the two - point correlation function of the density field @xmath1 and the power spectrum @xmath2 are power laws , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 for a primordial spectral index @xmath6 ; ( 2 ) the higher order @xmath0-point correlation functions @xmath7 scale as @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , or @xmath10 ; and ( 3 ) the pairwise peculiar velocity exactly cancels the hubble expansion on small scales , @xmath11 , so that bound , high - density halos maintain a fixed physical size . some of these predictions have agreed well enough with numerical simulation results ( jain 1997 and references therein ) to have obtained general acceptance .    in two recent papers we presented evidence from high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations that gravitational clustering does not necessarily follow the scaling @xmath12 required by the stability condition for the two- and three - point functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( ma & fry 2000a ) . for a deeper understanding of the strongly nonlinear regime beyond simulations",
    ", we proceeded to construct an analytic halo model ( ma & fry 2000b ) in which mass is distributed in spherical dark matter halos with phenomenological mass distribution functions , density profiles , and halo - halo correlations .",
    "we showed that this halo model can reproduce analytically the two- and three - point correlation functions measured in numerical simulations , and that it also makes useful predictions beyond the limited range of validity of simulations .    in this _",
    "letter _ we investigate the extent to which the analytic halo model is consistent with stable gravitational clustering in the strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "in particular , we derive the halo model predictions for the asymptotic nonlinear behavior of the @xmath0-point correlation functions (  2 ) and the pairwise peculiar velocities (  3 ) in terms of dark matter halo properties .",
    "we then obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the halo mass function and density profile in order to reproduce results of the stable clustering hypothesis .",
    "the analytic halo model of ma & fry ( 2000b ) for the @xmath0-point correlation functions of the mass density takes three inputs : the halo mass distribution function @xmath15 ; the halo density profile @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a scale radius and @xmath18 is the normalization ; and halo - halo correlations . in this model",
    ", the two - point function contains contributions from particle pairs residing in a single halo and in two separate halos , @xmath19 , where the subscripts `` @xmath20 '' and `` @xmath21 '' denote the respective `` 1-halo '' and `` 2-halo '' contributions ( see also seljak 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , we write the bispectrum @xmath22 as three separate terms , representing contributions from particle triplets that reside in a single halo and in two and three distinct halos . as shown in ma & fry ( 2000b ) , the dominant contribution in the nonlinear regime on small length scales",

    "all work on halo mass functions performed thus far has reported a much larger value for @xmath33 ; stable clustering therefore does not appear to be followed , which is consistent with the scale - dependent @xmath79 reported in ma & fry ( 2000a ) .",
    "we illustrate these results by showing in figure  1 the power spectrum and bispectrum computed from the analytic halo model for three sets of ( @xmath33 , @xmath66 ) for the @xmath68 scale - free model .",
    "the values of @xmath33 and @xmath66 are all chosen to give the same slope @xmath84 for the nonlinear two - point function ; the corresponding power spectra are therefore nearly identical at high @xmath56 .",
    "the three - point @xmath85 , however , have very different high-@xmath56 behavior for the three cases , and only the case @xmath81 produces an approximately scale - independent @xmath85 .",

    "so if the three - point correlation follows , stable clustering continues to hold for all orders for which the integral converges . at large @xmath56",
    ", we are probing the inner cores of halos , where the inner profile goes as @xmath76 .",

    "besides the scaling properties of the @xmath0-point correlation functions discussed above , stable clustering also predicts that the mean peculiar velocity @xmath96 between pairs of objects of separation @xmath54 must cancel the hubble expansion @xmath97 on small scales so that bound halos maintain a fixed physical size .",

    "we note that in equation ( [ beta ] ) , @xmath48 has an implicit dependence on @xmath100 through @xmath50 which roughly agrees with bullock et al . when @xmath83 .",
    "the prediction of the halo model for @xmath98 can be calculated from equations  ( [ 1-halo ] ) and ( [ dxida ] ) . before doing so , it is useful to derive first the asymptotic behavior of @xmath98 in the deeply nonlinear regime at small @xmath54 . on such small scales , @xmath114 , and gives a power law @xmath115 and @xmath116 . for a scale - free model ,",

    "an @xmath68 scale - free power spectrum is used for illustration .",
    "although @xmath13 is dominated by the 1-halo term @xmath121 of at @xmath122 , which is the range of interest for this paper , we improve the accuracy at @xmath123 by adding the linear theory @xmath124 to @xmath121 . as figure  2 shows",

    "2000 ) and @xmath129 ( cole & lacey 1996 ; navarro et al .",

    "we have computed the derivative @xmath130 using both eq .",
    "( [ dxida ] ) and @xmath131/{\\delta a}$ ] .",
    "the two methods give identical results , but eq .  ( [ dxida ] ) offers a more physical insight into the various contributing terms . for example , the broad peak in @xmath119 for @xmath132 is the result of the term in @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ dxida ] ) , which reflects that the integral on these scales is dominated by mass scales near @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we have derived the asymptotic nonlinear behavior of the @xmath0-point correlation functions @xmath134 ( eqs .",
    "[ [ gamma_model ] ] , [ [ gamma3_model ] ] , [ [ gamman_model ] ] ) and the pairwise peculiar velocities @xmath119 ( eq .  [ [ h_model ] ] ) in the framework of the recently proposed analytic halo model of ma & fry ( 2000b ) .",
    "we have shown that their small scale behavior is consistent with the stable clustering hypothesis only if dark matter halos satisfy certain criteria .",
    "the two halo parameters whose variation we have explored are the logarithmic slope @xmath33 of the halo mass distribution @xmath15 at the low mass end in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) and the slope @xmath52 for the mass dependence of the halo concentration parameter @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) ( recall @xmath135 ) .",
    "these two parameters are highlighted because results to date from numerical simulations have indicated a significant uncertainty , with @xmath136 and @xmath137 being plausible values .    from the derived asymptotic nonlinear behavior ,",
    "we have obtained analytically the relations that must be satisfied by @xmath33 and @xmath66 in order for stable clustering to occur .",
    "equations  ( [ stable2 ] ) , ( [ stable3 ] ) , and ( [ stablen ] ) summarize the results for the @xmath0-point correlation function @xmath134 .",
    "these equations and figure  1 indicate that although the two - point stable clustering condition alone is satisfied by an infinite set of @xmath120 for a given @xmath6 , the three- and higher - point stable clustering conditions , @xmath138 , imply @xmath33 must be zero . achieving stable clustering to all orders",
    "therefore requires stringent conditions : @xmath81 and @xmath83 . for non - scale - free models ( e.g. ,",
    "cold dark matter ) , @xmath6 is the index at the high-@xmath56 end of the power spectrum .    compared with the hierarchical model of davis & peebles ( 1977 ) , results from this paper and ma & fry ( 2000b ) show that the analytic halo model makes more general and physical predictions for the behavior of the @xmath0-point correlation functions and the pairwise velocities . imposing the stability condition @xmath81 and @xmath83 in equations  ( [ gamma_model ] ) , ( [ gamma3_model ] ) , and ( [ gamman_model ] ) , we indeed recover their results of @xmath139 with @xmath140 at small @xmath54 and @xmath141",
    ". the condition @xmath83 can be understood further by examining individual halos .",
    "using @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 up to a logarithmic factor , we see that @xmath83 gives approximately @xmath145 , which is consistent with the simulation results in bullock et al .",
    "the halo scale radius @xmath17 is then approximately constant in time in physical coordinates , as expected for a stable system , and the physical density @xmath146 of individual halos is indeed very close to constant in time , more so for very small halos that form early ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 ) than for those that form recently ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) .",
    "yano & gouda ( 1999 ) have found that for halo density @xmath151 with @xmath152 ( such as navarro et al . and moore et al . ) , the velocity parameter @xmath98 approaches 0 and the two - point correlation function @xmath13 approaches a constant ( i.e. @xmath153 ) in the nonlinear limit . neither behavior is seen in our figures because their derivation ignores the mass distribution function @xmath15 and is therefore valid only for equal mass halos .",
    "our earlier paper ( ma & fry 2000a ) has already shown signs of departure from the stable clustering hypothesis in high resolution @xmath0-body simulations . in this paper ,",
    "the specific values @xmath81 and @xmath83 required for stable clustering provide additional evidence that this long - cherished hypothesis may not be applicable in all situations . in such cases ,",
    "one consequence is that the frequently used fitting formulas for the nonlinear power spectrum ( hamilton et al 1991 ; jain et al .",
    "1995 ; peacock & dodds 1996 ; ma 1998 ) will need modifications at high @xmath56 , e.g. , @xmath154 for the @xmath68 model and @xmath155 mpc@xmath156 for cold dark matter models with a cosmological constant ( see figs .  3 and 4 of ma & fry 2000b ) .",
