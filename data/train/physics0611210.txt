    "the dynamics of the systems of self - propelling particles ( spp ) is of a great interest for physicists as well as for biologists because of the complex and fascinating phenomenon of the emergence of the ordered motion . in nature",
    "these systems are represented by flocks of birds , schools of fishes , groups of bacteria etc . @xcite-@xcite . from the physical point of view",
    "many aspects of the observed non - equilibrium phase transition from disordered to ordered motion are to a large extent still an open problem .",
    "the first numerical model simulating the behavior of the spp was proposed by t. vicsek at al .",
    "their model is based on a kinematic rule imposed on the orientations of the velocities of the self - propelling particles . at a low noise amplitude and a high density",
    "it was shown that the system undergoes the transition from the disordered state to coherent motion .",
    "the nature of the transition is not established yet .",
    "t. vicsek s investigation shows that the occurring transition is of the second order .",
    "several extensions of t. vicsek s model have been proposed , which consider particles with varying velocities , different types of noise , and including external force fields and/or interparticle attractive and repulsive forces @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the simulations performed in @xcite show the discontinuous nature of the transition in the t.vicseks model .",
    "properties of t. vicsek s model were also investigated analytically . in @xcite",
    "the spontaneous emergence of ordered motion has been studied in terms of so - called control laws , using graph theory .",
    "generalizations of the control laws were considered in jad2003,sepulchre2005 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the organized motion of spp with the control laws depending on the relative orientations of the velocities and relative spacing , can be of two types only : parallel and circular motion . the stability properties of these discrete updating rules ( including the t.vicseks model ) and the dynamics they describe were considered using lyapunov theory in @xcite .    in our first paper",
    "@xcite we constructed a hydrodynamic model for the system of self - propelling particles with conservative kinematic constraints , which can be considered as a continuum analogue of the discrete dynamic automaton proposed by t. vicsek et al .    based on the conservation of the kinetic energy and the number of particles our model",
    "is represented by the following equations : @xmath0where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the velocity and the density fields respectively and @xmath3 is an angular velocity field which takes into account the non - potential character of the interactions between the particles .",
    "we modeled this field as follows : @xmath4where @xmath5 are the averaging kernels . in particular we considered a simple case of averaging kernels : @xmath6we call this the local hydrodynamic model ( lhm ) . in this case eq .",
    "reduces to @xmath7where @xmath8 in our second article @xcite we have shown that the only regimes of the stationary planar motion in our model are either of translational or axial symmetry . in this respect",
    "our continuum model gives results similar with those obtained in the discrete model of t.vicsek @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the stability of the obtained regimes of motion with respect to small perturbations . in the next section",
    "we consider the stability of the planar stationary linear flow with respect to the velocity perturbation directed along the stationary flow and perpendicular to the flow .",
    "we show that in both cases the evolution of the perturbations has an oscillatory behavior , which means that they neither grow nor decay with time .",
    "this can be interpreted as neutral stability @xcite of the corresponding stationary flow .",
    "also the external pressure term @xmath9 can be included into eq .   in order to account for potential external forces .",
    "in such a case with @xmath10 there exists the special case of the incompressible flows , @xmath11 , when the equations of motion coincide with that for potential flow of ideal fluids .",
    "as is known @xcite such motion in @xmath12 geometry is stable in the lyapunov sense .    in the third section",
    "we consider the stability of the planar stationary radially symmetric ( vortical ) motion of spp with constant velocity and the density .",
    "we find that in this case the linear analysis does not lead to a conclusive answer about the stability of the solution .",
    "in this section we consider the stability properties of planar stationary linear flow for the local hydrodynamic model with @xmath10 , which we further call local hydrodynamic model 1 ( lhm1 ) . at the end of the section",
    "we will shortly discuss how these results extend to the local hydrodynamic models with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "for lhm1 the stationary linear flow is given by @xmath15where @xmath16 and @xmath17  are constants .",
    "we consider velocity and the density perturbations of the following form : @xmath18the velocity perturbation chosen is directed along the stationary linear flow . here",
    "@xmath19 are constants , @xmath20 is the wave vector and @xmath21 is an exponent , which determines the time evolution of the perturbation .    substituting the solution @xmath22 into eqs .",
    "- we obtain the linearized system of equations : @xmath23for the perturbation this system reduces to @xmath24using eq .",
    "one may obtain the relation between @xmath25 and the wave number . from eq .",
    "it follows that @xmath26whereas from the linearized continuity equation we have @xmath27both the equalities are satisfied only in the case when @xmath28 .",
    "thus , in the linear stability analysis with respect to small deviations of the velocity and density fields , we obtain the following perturbed solution @xmath29 .\\]]taking the real part of the density perturbation we have @xmath30 \\ , .",
    "\\label{persol}\\]]the corresponding density field is shown on fig1 .",
    "this flow eq .   should satisfy the linearized system of the constraints ( conservation of the kinetic energy and the number of particles ) which are imposed on any solution of our model .",
    "this implies that the following conditions must be fulfilled : @xmath31 d\\mathbf{r } & = & 0 .",

    "[ 19 ] over the period of the integrand , one may can that this condition is fulfilled .",
    "the obtained perturbed flow is an oscillatory field ( perturbation oscillates with a frequency @xmath34 as @xmath35 ) which means that the corresponding stationary solution is neither stable nor unstable within the first order perturbation theory . in other words",
    "we may conclude that in our local hydrodynamic model the stationary linear flow is neutrally stable with respect to a small density field perturbations .",
    "the stability analysis of the other possible hydrodynamic models with @xmath13 or @xmath14 gives qualitatively similar result .      in this section",
