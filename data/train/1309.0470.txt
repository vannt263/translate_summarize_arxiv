    "oscillations in the response of a system to external perturbations are a characteristic fingerprint of wave - like , that is , coherent dynamics . however , in the presence of environmental noise , which is inevitable in biological systems , oscillatory features are expected to be short - lived . the observation of persistent oscillations in the non - linear optical spectra of various photosynthetic complexes at both cryogenic and physiological temperatures @xcite , together with recent results on individual antenna complexes @xcite and synthetic heterodimers @xcite , has led to a multidisciplinary effort to try and identify the specific mechanisms and conditions that enable biological systems to generate such long - lived oscillatory dynamics @xcite and to elucidate the functional relevance of such coherent dynamics @xcite .",
    "+ these observations are of interest for a variety of reasons . from the point of view of the theory of open quantum systems ,",
    "the accurate dynamical description of such complexes presents a considerable challenge as it requires transcending the weak coupling and short memory regimes and going beyond merely inducing irreversible decoherence and dissipation .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the observed _ coherence _ persists on time scales that are comparable to the duration of typical transfer time from the absorption in the antennae to the arrival in the reaction center implies the very real possibility that the coherent dynamics of the propagation contributes in a significant way to the ( optimal ) function of the complex .",
    "this in turn would represent a far reaching result which departs from the standard paradigm of relating structure to function by giving a more prominent role to the dynamics @xcite .",
    "+ however , any quantitative formulation of such a relation requires as a first step the clear identification of the different coherent mechanisms that contribute to the observed spectral signals . within this context ,",
    "a crucial question to answer is : _ which dynamical information is being encoded in those oscillatory features ? _",
    "while initially it was conjectured that long - lived oscillations are a manifestation of purely electronic coherence @xcite , this appeared to require unrealistically low reorganization energies of the vibrational environment or the existence of correlated fluctuations , both of which appear unlikely to be correct on the basis of recent numerical work @xcite .",
    "microscopic models that were more recently proposed to account for the presence of non - transient coherence @xcite , however , do require additional vibrational contributions that may end up in the generation of mixed _ vibronic _ coherence or even purely vibrational features @xcite .",
    "+ the purpose of this work is to analyze the spectral signatures of the model developed in @xcite , which explains how picosecond electronic coherence can be driven and supported by quasi - coherent interactions between excitons and spectrally sharp local vibrational modes in the environment ( most likely due to intra - molecular motion of the chromophores ) .",
    "the mixing of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom due to this non - adiabatic dynamics typically results in vibronic coherence between the dressed states of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we will show that , for realistic parameter regimes , we expect the resulting overall spectral signal to encompass contributions that have a genuine excitonic component and whose weight is comparable to those resulting from purely vibrational coherence within the electronic ground state manifold",
    ". moreover , we stress again that the manifestation of the latter does require the existence of excitonic coupling , as remarked also in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our results are also compatible with those obtained within the framework of discussing the exciton - phonon interaction in terms of intensity borrowing of dipolar strength @xcite and confirm the relevance of coherent excitonic coupling to explain current spectral observations .",
    "+ we have organized the presentation as follows .",
    "following @xcite , a model dimeric structure is presented to capture some of the prominent features displayed by the complete 2d spectral analysis of the fenna - matthew - olson ( fmo ) complex , which at present is the pigment protein complex which has been subjected to the most detailed investigation .",
    "we then discuss the theoretical background underlying the evaluation of the third order response measured in 2d photon echo experiments and clearly identify the different pathways corresponding to processes involving excitonic and vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "finally we compute exactly the nonlinear response for our model system without resorting to lineshape theory , and evaluate the magnitude of the different paths to assess the relative weight and time scale where excitonic and vibrational coherence manifest .",
    "the simplest model system that can give rise to delocalized eigenstates is an exitonically coupled dimer ( ecd ) , consisting of two cofactors , chromophores @xmath0 and @xmath1 , interacting via an electrostatic coulomb interaction .",
    "the hilbert space of the two _ particles _ can be expanded in the site ( localized ) basis of states @xmath2 ( two chromophores de - excited ) , @xmath3 ( both chromophores electronically excited ) , @xmath4 ( chromophore @xmath0 excited ) and @xmath5 ( chromophore @xmath1 excited ) . in the case of neutral molecules ,",
    "the coulomb potential between different chromophores is dominated by their dipole - dipole interaction and the system hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the energy gap of cofactors @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively and @xmath9/r^3 $ ] is the standard dipole - dipole interaction energy between two point electric dipoles @xmath10 , @xmath11 residing on cofactors connected by a vector @xmath12 of length @xmath13 .",

    "the coupling of excitonic degrees of freedom to vibrational modes with energies in the vicinity of the excitonic splitting @xmath24 can have a significant impact on the electronic dynamics , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , this coupling can express itself in the persistence of oscillatory features in observables pertaining to purely excitonic degrees of freedom such as the survival probability of a selected excitonic superposition state @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in studying explicitly signatures of these vibrational modes in non - linear photon echo signals and , more specifically , in analyzing the effect that these modes have on the dynamics of the peak beatings in the population time . to this effect",

    "this assumption will be relaxed later when 2d spectra are evaluated . in the following",
    "we will consider a model system whose parameters are inspired by the dominant dimeric structure in fmo , as provided by sites 3 and 4 @xcite .",

    "it is convenient to express the parameters of our system in terms of the physically relevant exciton energy splitting @xmath24 of our purely electronic hamiltonian  .",

    "the spectrum of the total hamiltonian eq .   can not be fully specified in terms of the eigenstates of the purely electronic dimer @xmath54 .",
    "the exciton - vibrational coupling renders the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian a complex superposition of electronic and vibrational wavefunctions .",
    "nonetheless , if we constrain ourselves to a regime where the interaction strength with the harmonic mode is moderate , the structure of eigenstates of the full hamiltonian can still be understood as different vibrational progressions of each electronic state of the purely electronic dimer . in this scenario",

    "in this section we describe how to compute the 2d photon echo spectroscopy signal in the joint perturbative and impulsive limit which applies to a wide variety of experiments such as @xcite .",

    "the dynamical evolution of the system is contained in the propagator @xmath132 , while the strength of the dipolar transitions is given by the matrix elements of the electric - dipole operator @xmath87 . in order to observe long - lived dynamical features of any kind during the population time of an electronic 2d experiment",
    "we require : i/ an intrinsic dynamical behavior during this period of time consistent with these long dephasing times and ii/ significant amplitude of the different dipolar transitions that play a role in this particular process .",
    "resorting to a simplified diagrammatic viewpoint appropriate to the perturbative setting that we are considering here , the amplitude of a certain spectroscopic complete pathway is proportional to the product of the four different matrix elements of the dipolar operator involved in the diagram ( see fig 2 ) describing this particular process .",
    "the interaction of a purely electronic dimer with localized vibrational modes , as described by the hamiltonian @xmath133 in eq .  , leads to crucial changes in the two aforementioned factors and therefore the system s response can differ significantly from that of a purely excitonic coupled dimer @xcite . +",
    "in particular , long - lasting beatings of the electronic 2d spectra signal during the population time may be facilitated by the vibronic coupling @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can be cast in terms of two interacting systems with intrinsically different dephasing time scales : a purely vibrational superposition tends to exhibit long lifetimes while the life time of a superposition of exciton states is subject to rapid dephasing due to the relatively strong interaction with the broad band environment . in a ( relatively ) weak electronic - vibrational coupling regime ,",
    "the mode experiences an effective dephasing rate mediated by the electronic system .",
    "this effective decoherence time can in general be much longer that the excitonic dephasing times .",
    "any electronic - vibrational superposition of states during the population time can hence show extended dephasing times .",
    "note , however , that it is still not immediately transparent how this effect will manifest when the system is probed via a photon echo sequence as a quasi - resonant coupling between electronic and vibrational motion strongly affects the structure of the energy levels in the one - exciton sector , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : level_crossing ] .",
    "the existence of self - avoided level crossings in the energy level structure is of crucial importance in the redistribution of the strength between dipolar transitions involving the ground - state- and the one - exciton - manifolds and will therefore dictate the characteristics of the optical response .",
    "+ in order to understand the main effects , and for the sake of clarity , we will restrict the discussion to a weak electronic - vibrational interaction regime .",
    "let us begin with the scenario in which vibrational mode and excitonic energy differences are non - resonant , in which case we describe the eigenstates of our system , to first order , by separable states containing an electronic wavefunction and the corresponding vibrational one .",
    "that is , product states of the form @xmath134 ( and analogously for the states @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) . in this situation",
    "the transition strength between the excitonic states @xmath135 , @xmath137 and the ground state @xmath138 is weighted by the vibrational franck - condon factor @xmath139 . roughly speaking ,",
    "these factors quantify the overlap of two displaced harmonic oscillator wavefunctions with respect to a fixed reference .",
    "if we take the displacement ( related to the parameter @xmath140 in our model ) tend to zero , the overlap @xmath139 can be seen to behave as a delta function giving a finite value only when @xmath141 .",
    "that is , the dipolar transition strength is only different from zero between states with the same vibrational quantum number ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dipolar_transitions]a ) .",
    "finite values of the displacement @xmath140 result in a small but finite overlap and hence transition strength between states with different vibrational quantum numbers .",
    "we emphasize that these dipolar strengths between different vibrational states tend to be weaker than those transitions connecting states with the same vibrational quantum numbers ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dipolar_transitions]b where we have used thinner lines to represent the weaker transitions between different vibrational states ) .",
    "+ an important regime concerning the distribution of dipolar transition strength different from the cases discussed above is found when a resonance between excitonic transition frequencies and vibrational frequencies occurs . in this situation",
    "a description via electronic - vibrational product states is no longer appropriate and it is advantageous to adopt a description in terms of the dressed states @xmath142 . the dipolar transition strength between the states @xmath142 and the states @xmath143 and @xmath144 in the ground state manifold may indeed have comparable values even though the transitions involve different quantum vibrational numbers .",
