    "for distant stellar populations , one relies upon the integrated colors or spectra to investigate their ages and metallicities since individual stars are not resolved . in this paper , we will specifically focus on the h@xmath0 index that is widely used as an age indicator .",
    "it has been highlighted because it is ( 1 ) the only index that shows the anticorrelation with metallicity and ( 2 ) sensitive to temperature by reaching a maximum strength at around 9500 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of the previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , however , have been done on the basis that stars near the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) region are the most dominant sources for the integrated strength of h@xmath0 .",
    "consequently , without the meticulous consideration for stars beyond the red giant branch ( rgb ) , they claimed that the strength of h@xmath0 depends on the location of the msto , which in turn depends on the age at a given metallicity .",
    "several investigators , however , have cast some doubt upon the sensitivity of the h@xmath0 index given the presence of other warm stars , especially blue horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    on the observational side , it was barely possible to obtain low s / n spectra of globular clusters in systems outside the local group ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these spectra have only been used for kinematic information . with the advent of 10 m - class telescopes , however , kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and cohen , blakeslee , & ryzhov ( 1998 ) have successfully obtained relatively high s / n spectra that provide reliable line indices calibration for globular clusters in ngc 1399 and m87 , the central giant elliptical galaxies in fornax and virgo clusters .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of globular clusters in the milky way galaxy and those in ngc 1399 in the h@xmath0 versus mg@xmath1 diagram . at first glance",
    ", there seems to be little difference between these two systems especially when considering the large uncertainties in ngc 1399 globular cluster system .",
    "some careful scrutiny of the data , however , indicates that there is a systematic difference in the sense that the metal - rich clusters in ngc 1399 have higher h@xmath0 compared to galactic counterparts , while the opposite seems to be the case for the more metal - poor clusters .",
    "in fact , a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test gives only 2.14% probability , excluding the two very metal - rich ngc 1399 clusters , that the two samples are extracted from the same parent population .",
    "this systematic difference has motivated us to explore the sensitivity of the integrated h@xmath0 strength with detailed population synthesis models that reproduce the systematic variation of hb morphology with age and metallicity .",
    "the hb stars are not unusual components of old stellar systems since they are ubiquitously found from the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of galactic globular clusters and the stellar evolution theories remarkably reproduce them to a certain degree ( e.g. , lee , demarque , & zinn 1990 , 1994 ) . in the following section , our population models without and with considering hb stars are presented .",
    "section 3 reinforces the validity of our models with hb stars by comparing them to a sample of galactic globular clusters and compares our results with the observations of globular cluster systems in the milky way galaxy , m31 , ngc 1399 , and m87 .",
    "finally , section 4 discusses major implications from our works .",
    "the present models were constructed by using our evolutionary population synthesis code , which was developed specifically to study the stellar populations in globular clusters . for our population models , the yale isochrones ( @xcite ) rescaled for @xmath2-elements enhancement ( @xcite ) and the hb evolutionary tracks by yi , demarque , & kim ( 1997 ) have been used . for metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xmath4 0.5 ) populations , the helium enrichment parameter , @xmath5_y_/@xmath5_z _ = 2 , is assumed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) @xmath6 with @xmath7 = 2.35 is adopted for the relative number of stars along the isochrones , but the effects of the variations of @xmath7 are also tested and described in section 2.2 .",
    "for the conversion from theoretical quantities to observable quantities , we have taken the most recently compiled stellar library of lejeune , cuisinier , & buser ( 1998 ) in order to cover the largest possible ranges in stellar parameters such as metallicity , temperature , and gravity .",
    "the strength of the spectral line indices is calculated with either @xmath8 or @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an index bandpass and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the flux in the index bandpass and the pseudocontinuum flux in the index bandpass ( @xcite ) .",
    "first , for each star ( or bunch of stars after the binning ) with a given metallicity , temperature , and gravity , we find the flux values at both pseudocontinuum regions for each index from the stellar library",
    ". then we calibrate @xmath12 at the center of each index bandpasses .",
    "second , we calculate either the equivalent width ( ew ; for h@xmath0 and mg @xmath13 ) or the magnitude ( mag ; for mg@xmath1 ) using worthey et al.s ( 1994 ) fitting functions",
    ". then we solve for @xmath11 .",
    "after @xmath12 and @xmath11 are all summed up for a simple stellar population of a given metallicity and age , finally , we compute the integrated strengths of spectral line indices using formulae ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the lick / ids system bandpasses that have been used in this work as defined in burstein et al .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we have used burstein et al .",
    "( 1984 ) definitions in this work to be compatible with the data that we are going to fit in section 3 .",
    "we have not taken into account either blue stragglers ( bss ) or post - hb stars in our models , since it is hard to quantify them systematically with metallicity and age because of the poor knowledge of their evolution and also due to their scarcity . with the inclusion of the bss",
    ", we would expect the strength of h@xmath0 to slightly increase .",
    "we suspect , however , that the post - hb stars would hardly affect this index mainly due to their paucity .      before proceeding to the construction of models with hb stars ,",
    "we have first compared our models without considering hb stars with those of worthey ( 1994 ) , the most widely used models , to make sure that our calculations are consistent with previous investigations . for this purpose",
    ", we have taken the same index bandpasses that worthey ( 1994 ) used in his model calculations .",
    "it is clear from figure 2 that both models generate very similar results although there are slight differences mostly due to the different isochrones employed in the two models .",
    "it is also worth noting that worthey models which treated hb stars as red clumps are similar to our models without hb stars as already noted by rabin ( 1982 ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite , see the caption of their fig .",
    "6 ) . without the systematic variation of hb morphology that we are going to employ in the following subsection",
    ", one can see from figure 2 that the h@xmath0 decreases as metallicity and age increase simply because the msto temperature decreases with these variations .",
    "recently , there have been increasing number of reports that the evolutionary time scale from ms to rgb should be substantially decreased if the developments of the stellar evolution theories , particularly due to the effects of diffusion and the coulomb correction to the equation of state in the isochrones , are employed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , according to chaboyer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , it is suggested that the age of galactic globular clusters should be reduced by 18% once one considers this improved input physics .",
    "hence , a correction was applied in our models to simulate these age reduction effects .",
    "for example , 15 gyr isochrones are consequently employed to represent 12 gyr populations .",
    "one can see this effect on the h@xmath0 index in figure 3 .",
    "the dashed lines are made when the standard yale isochrones are used , while the solid lines show what we described above after employing the correction .",
    "it is clear from figure 3 that the isochrones with the improved input physics ( solid lines ) should result in the decrease of h@xmath0 mainly due to the decrease of the msto temperature .",
    "hereafter , these simulated isochrones are used for further computations even though the conclusions drawn below should be relatively insensitive to this correction .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that only relative ages are meaningful from this study until the isochrones that incorporate the input physics fully consistent with real stars emerge .      in order to include hb stars into our models ,",
    "first , we need to estimate the amounts of mass loss on the rgb . in this study",
    ", we have adopted reimers mass - loss relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath14 , the empirical fitting factor in reimers mass - loss relation , was estimated by matching the tight correlations between [ fe / h ] and hb morphology type [ ( b@xmath4r)/(b+v+r ) ] ( @xcite ) of the inner halo galactic globular clusters ( galactocentric radius @xmath15 8 kpc , filled symbols in figure 4 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath14 = 0.65 was determined at the recently favored mean age ( @xmath16 12 gyr , @xmath5 t = 0 gyr ) of them in the light of new distance scale as suggested by hipparcos ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) as well as from the recent developments of the stellar evolution theories ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the modified gaussian mass distribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , @xmath17 ( m_{rg } - m ) exp[- { { ( \\overline{m_{hb } } - m ) ^2 } \\over { 2 \\sigma^2}}]\\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a mass dispersion factor in solar mass , @xmath19 is a normalization factor , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 m@xmath22 @xmath4 @xmath5 m ) is the mean mass of hb stars , was employed with @xmath18 = 0.02 m@xmath23 .",
    "figure 4 presents our model isochrones in the plot of the hb type as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "figure 5 vividly shows how the isochrones in figure 4 are generated . from the cmds in the first column of figure 5 ,",
    "one clearly sees the effect of metallicity , the first parameter that governs the hb morphology type , in the sense that hb becomes redder as metallicity increases .",
    "one can also see that the age works as the global second parameter that characterizes the hb morphology by looking at figure 5 horizontally , in the sense that it becomes bluer with increasing age at a given metallicity ( see also @xcite ) .    in figure 6 ,",
    "the variations of h@xmath0 strength as a function of metallicity are plotted at given ages based on the model loci of figure 4 .",
    "it should be noted here that , unlike the models without hb stars ( dashed lines ) , the distinct  wave - like \" features ( solid lines ) appear from our models with hb stars .",
    "these features are clearly understood with the aid of figure 5 .",
    "for example , refer the five cmds in the first column of figure 5 from bottom to top and accordingly follow the model line of @xmath5 t = 0 gyr in figure 6 from low to high metallicity .",
    "it is evident that ( 1 ) there is an enhancement in h@xmath0 and it becomes a maximum where hb stars are centered around 9500 k ( ( @xmath24 @xmath4 @xmath25)@xmath26 @xmath16 0 ) , the temperature at which the h@xmath0 index becomes strongest , even though the temperature of msto is getting lower with increasing metallicity , ( 2 ) after the peak , the h@xmath0 enhancement decreases since the mean temperature of hb stars is getting lower , and ( 3 ) with only cool red hb stars , the strength of h@xmath0 even becomes slightly weaker than that from the models without hb stars .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the peak of the h@xmath0 enhancement moves to higher metallicity as age gets older .",
    "therefore , the strength of h@xmath0 does not simply decrease with either increasing age or increasing metallicity once hb stars are included in the models .",
    "as figure 5 clearly demonstrates , the strength of h@xmath0 depends not only on the location of the msto but also on the distribution of hb stars .",
    "now it is clear that the blue hb stars around ( @xmath24 @xmath4 @xmath25)@xmath26 @xmath16 0 are the key contributors for the strength of h@xmath0 .",
    "the differences in h@xmath0 strengths between the models with and without hb stars are as much as 0.75  at the peak .",
    "this is in accordance with the empirical estimate by burstein et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and buzzoni , mantegazza , & gariboldi ( 1994 ) , although these authors did not investigate the systematic variations we report here .",
    "it must be noted here that worthey et al.s ( 1994 ) fitting functions are only given till 13,260 k. for the stars hotter than 13,260 k , we extrapolated their fitting functions for mg@xmath1 and mg @xmath13 . for h@xmath0 , however , we employed tables by kurucz ( 1993 ) that give explicit values for the balmer line strengths at a given metallicity , temperature , and gravity . a systematic shift ( @xmath16 6.1  ) was necessary in order to make h@xmath0 values from kurucz ( 1993 ) match those from worthey et al.s ( 1994 ) fitting function at temperature around 13,000 k. note that this treatment takes effect only for blue hb stars from very metal - poor and very old populations ( the left - side of the peaks for model lines of @xmath5 t = + 2 and + 4 gyr in figure 6 ) . therefore , the general  wave - like \" features including the location of peaks should not be affected by this treatment .",
    "the fitting functions in this temperature range are needed in the near future , however , to better estimate the effects from those hot stars on the spectral line indices .",
    "we also have looked into the dependence of strengths of h@xmath0 and mg@xmath1 on the initial mass function .",
    "it is found that the variations of the exponent @xmath7 of the initial mass function between 1.35 and 3.35 are negligible , in the sense that they roughly correspond to the errors estimated from the fitting functions , @xmath16 0.22  for h@xmath0 and @xmath16 0.008 mag for mg@xmath1 .",
    "the remarkable effects of hb stars on the strength of h@xmath0 are elaborated in the previous section . to corroborate our results , our models with hb stars",
    "are tested using observations of galactic globular clusters , the only objects that the independent hb morphology types can be evaluated .",
    "we have chosen a sample within a narrow range of metallicity , so that the metallicity effects on the hb morphology can be put aside .",
    "then we investigate whether the strengths of h@xmath0 of the sample globular clusters are really in connection with their hb morphology .    in figure 7",
    ", we have fixed the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath4 1.535 ; dashed lines and @xmath4 0.814 ; solid lines , respectively ) and calculated the strengths of h@xmath0 with varying ages . as age increases",
    ", the msto temperature is getting cooler while the hb morphology becomes bluer .",
    "it is shown here that the strength of h@xmath0 gradually increases as the hb morphology becomes bluer surpassing the msto temperature variations .",
    "the thin lines that have actually nothing to do with hb types only indicate the level of h@xmath0 strengths without hb stars .",
    "the sample of galactic globular clusters within the similar metallicity range ( data from @xcite ) that already denoted by squares in figure 4 is superposed .",
    "it is clear from figure 7 that ( 1 ) the inclusion of relevant hb stars is essential in the population models for h@xmath0 and ( 2 ) our assumption of the age as the global second parameter reproduces the observations within the errors .",
    "what is evident from this test is that the inclusion of pertinent hb stars is dominant over the msto temperature variations for the strengths of h@xmath0 of globular clusters .",
    "therefore , one should give great care to hb stars for the population synthesis models in order to match the observations of old stellar systems such as globular clusters .",
    "having confirmed that the detailed modeling of hb is crucial in the use of h@xmath0 index as an age indicator , now we compare our results with observations of globular cluster systems in the milky way galaxy , m31 , ngc 1399 , and m87 .",
    "it is important to note here that all of these observations except for m31 globular clusters were carried out at the keck telescope with the identical instrumental configuration , the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , @xcite ) , so that the relative comparisons between these cluster systems are not affected by systematic and instrumental inhomogeneity .",
    "first , figure 8a presents the comparison of the globular cluster system in the milky way galaxy with that in m31 in the h@xmath0@xmath4mg@xmath1 plane . for the galactic globular cluster system , a set of 12 globular clusters that were obtained by cohen , blakeslee , & ryzhov ( 1998 )",
    "are used . for that in m31 ,",
    "15 out of 18 globular clusters in common with burstein et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and huchra et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are used .",
    "we have taken huchra et al .",
    "( 1996 ) data here , since they were obtained with higher resolution and high s / n at the multiple mirror telescope . three clusters ( g1 , g33 , and g222 ; g from sargent et al .",
    "( 1977 ) ) are excluded because they show more than 1  differences in h@xmath0 between burstein et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and huchra et al .",
    "( 1996 ) observations .",
    "the errors given in the diagram are the average from the m31 sample .",
    "it is found from figure 8a that both globular cluster systems are fundamentally not quite different , in terms of h@xmath0 strengths as a function of metallicity .",
    "they are reasonably well traced by our models of @xmath5 t = 0 gyr , i.e. , t = 12 gyr .    next , in figure 8b",
    ", the globular cluster system in ngc 1399 is compared with that in the the milky way galaxy . despite the still large observational uncertainties in ngc 1399 globular cluster system obtained by kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the systematic shift that we noticed in section 1 between these two systems is now understood by the age difference .",
    "it is inferred from figure 8b that the ngc 1399 globular cluster system is perhaps systematically older , in the mean , than the galactic counterpart by about 4 gyr .    in the following diagram",
    ", we compare m87 globular cluster system with that in the the milky way galaxy .",
    "for m87 globular clusters , h@xmath0@xmath4 mg @xmath13 plane is used since cohen , blakeslee , & ryzhov ( 1998 ) preferred narrower mg @xmath13 index to broader mg@xmath1 index due to their observational condition . among 150 sample from cohen , blakeslee , & ryzhov ( 1998 ) ,",
    "we have taken 35 globular clusters that have relatively higher s / n ( qsnr @xmath3 50 ) .",
    "it appears from figure 8c that the age difference of @xmath5 t = + 3.5 best reproduces the m87 globular cluster system in the h@xmath0@xmath4 mg @xmath13 plane , although better data are clearly needed to confirm this .",
    "we do not claim here that all of the globular clusters in giant elliptical galaxies are coeval and older than galactic counterparts .",
    "in fact , there is now a growing body of evidence that suggests age variations among globular clusters in the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this respect",
    ", we suspect that there would be a similar age variations among globular clusters in giant elliptical galaxies",
    ". however , the quality of the present data , even taken with the 10 m - class telescope , is still far from attempting such detailed analysis .",
    "we have found in this work that ( 1 ) the integrated h@xmath0 strengths of old stellar systems , such as globular clusters , are significantly affected by hb stars , and ( 2 ) the present observational data for the globular cluster systems are best understood in terms of systematic age differences among them , in the sense that globular clusters in more massive galaxies are older .",
    "if our age estimation is confirmed to be correct , this would indicate that the star formation in denser environments has proceeded much more rapidly and efficiently , so that the initial epoch of star formation in more massive ( and denser ) systems occurred several billion years earlier than that of the milky way ( see also lee 1992 ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the view that a substantial population of the massive early - type galaxies formed earlier at very high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "further observations of globular cluster systems in nearby galaxies from the large ground - based telescopes are imperative to manifest this possible systematic age difference .",
    "in addition , satellite uv photometry could also provide a test for the validity of our results presented in this paper , because it is expected that older globular clusters would reveal the stronger uv fluxes and the bluer uv colors as their blue hb stars should be hotter than those in the galactic counterparts at given metallicity ( see figure 1 of park & lee ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "these new observations , together with the detailed population models presented here , will undoubtedly help to clarify our understanding of the formation epoch of galaxies .",

    "<S> the strength of the h@xmath0 index has been computed for the integrated spectra of model globular clusters from the evolutionary population synthesis . these models </S>",
    "<S> take into account , for the first time , the detailed systematic variation of horizontal - branch ( hb ) morphology with age and metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> our models show that the h@xmath0 index is significantly affected by the presence of blue hb stars . because of the contribution from blue hb stars , the h@xmath0 does not monotonically decrease as metallicity increases at a given age . instead , it reaches a maximum strength when the distribution of hb stars is centered around 9500 k , the temperature where the h@xmath0 index becomes strongest . </S>",
    "<S> our models indicate that the strength of the h@xmath0 index increases as much as 0.75  due to the presence of blue hb stars .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the recent keck observations of the globular cluster system in the milky way galaxy with those in giant elliptical galaxies , ngc 1399 and m87 , shows a systematic shift in the h@xmath0 against metallicity plane . </S>",
    "<S> our models suggest that this systematic difference is understood if the globular cluster systems in giant elliptical galaxies are several billion years older , in the mean , than the galactic counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> further observations of globular cluster systems in the external galaxies from the large ground - based telescopes and space uv facilities will enable to clarify whether this difference is indeed due to the age difference or other explanations are also possible . </S>"
