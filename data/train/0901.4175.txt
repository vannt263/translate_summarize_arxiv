    "to date , @xmath0 has been a center of discussions on the generation of resonances with strangeness .",
    "especially , we have had many arguments on the internal structure of @xmath3 , which differs from usual color - singlet three - quark baryons for instance  @xcite . in terms of chiral dynamics",
    ", @xmath3 is also proposed to be a quasi @xmath7 bound state as an @xmath2-wave resonance  @xcite .",
    "related to this interesting subject , there have been many theoretical works done in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "experimentally , the hadron - induced productions of @xmath3 were explored in refs .",
    "@xcite , whereas the photon - induced experiments have been performed mainly by leps collaboration at spring-8 in japan  @xcite .",
    "the recent experiment for the @xmath3 photoproduction via the @xmath1 scattering process , conducted by leps collaboration  @xcite , showed considerable angular dependence of its production rate . in comparison to the previous experiment  @xcite , in which the outgoing pion and kaon were detected almost in a forward angle region ,",
    "the new experiment measured the pion for a _ wider _ angle using the time - projection chamber ( tpc ) , whereas the kaon was detected for a forward angle in a similar way to that of the previous one .",
    "typical features observed in the new experiment are given as follows :    * there is a larger @xmath3-production rate for the @xmath8 channel than that for the @xmath9 one , while their production rate were similar to each other in the previous experiment .",
    "we note that the production rate for the @xmath8 channel is almost twice in comparison to that for the @xmath9 one in the @xmath10 missing mass spectrum . *",
    "as the energy of the incident photon increases , the @xmath3-production rate decreases drastically .",
    "in other words , @xmath3 is produced mainly in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "considering the @xmath11-photoproduction experiment by clas collaboration at jafferson lab  @xcite , the @xmath3-production rate is about seven times larger for the region @xmath12 gev than that beyond it .",
    "if this is the case , the difference between the two experiments  @xcite may tell us that the angular dependence of the @xmath3-production mechanism is of great importance . in the present work ,",
    "we want to investigate this interesting observation theoretically , employing a coupled - channel formalism , i.e. , the chiral unitary model ( @xmath13um ) , which has explained the nature of @xmath3 successfully as a @xmath2-wave resonance as well as a quasi - bound state of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath3 has been also interpreted as a two - pole structure within the framework  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 photoproduction via the @xmath1 scattering process was already explored using the @xmath13um with only the @xmath2-wave meson - baryon interaction , such as the weinberg - tomozawa one  @xcite . in order to take into account the angular - dependent meson - baryon interaction ,",
    "we include a @xmath4-wave contribution from @xmath5 additionally , as done by one of the authors ( d.j . ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .    incorporating these previous works  @xcite ,",
    "we want to provide theoretical interpretations on the interesting recent experimental data .",
    "as numerical results , we present the @xmath6 invariant - mass spectrum for the two different isospin channels as well as the dalitz plot as a function of the two invariant masses , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . from these results , we observe that the effects from the @xmath16-pole contribution is compatible in comparison with that of @xmath3 . unfortunately , the large difference between the isospin channels is not reproduced within the present level of calculations , in which the production mechanism of @xmath3 and @xmath16 is partially considered . moreover ,",
    "the typical energy dependence is also hard to be explained . from these observations ,",
    "we conclude that it is necessary to include more realistic contributions , which reflect the structural information of @xmath3 , such as a diagram with a meson - baryon loop , to which the incident photon couples , etc ..    we organize this report as follows : in section  ii we provide formalism for the @xmath13um with the @xmath2- and @xmath4-wave contributions .",
    "the @xmath3-photoprodution amplitude is computed in the present approach in sectoin  iii .",
