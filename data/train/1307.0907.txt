    "about 1% of galaxies have an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , which emits @xmath5@xmath6 times the solar power over a wide range of the energy spectrum , from radio to gamma - ray energies .",
    "agns constitute one of the most violently variable and interesting classes of object in the universe .",
    "the activity of agn is believed to originate from the central supermassive black hole , with masses of @xmath7@xmath5 solar mass ( @xmath8 ) , and part of their energy is emitted in electromagnetic radiation from the surrounding region including the accretion disk formed around the black hole and relativistic jets ejected along rotation axes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a subclass of radio - loud agn are called blazars , in which the line of sight lies close to the jet axis , and the emission from relativistic jets is only visible in this class of agn due to the relativistic beaming effect , especially in the high - energy region .",
    "the electromagnetic spectra of blazars are dominated by non - thermal radiation produced in the jets . the popular scenario to explain these emission spectra assumes that the particles in the jets are accelerated to high energies by diffusive shocks in the jets and induce emission via interaction with surrounding matter / radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observations of blazars at various wavelengths have revealed fast time variability which is most plausibly related to instabilities in the emission environment near the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "past observations suggest the variability is larger at higher energies ( the most extreme example is mrk 501 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may indicate the higher energy emission comes from the region closer to the central black holes .",
    "the variability time scale reflects the size of the emission region , and thus the study of temporal behavior of gamma - ray flux is an excellent probe of the region close to the central engine , i.e. , the supermassive black hole .",
    "blazars are known to show flaring activity which occurs randomly and continues for several days to months . in order to study their temporal variability precisely , blazars should be monitored continuously , or at least frequently .",
    "it is not an easy task for narrow field - of - view telescopes like optical , x - ray , and cherenkov ( tev gamma - ray ) instruments to monitor many blazars for long periods . besides",
    ", their observations are limited as ground - based telescopes can only operate on dark , clear nights and x - ray satellites are used in pointing - mode observations .",
    "nevertheless , in the x - ray band , @xcite evaluated the central black hole masses in several agns based on their rather well - sampled x - ray light curves obtained with the _ ginga _ satellite and suggested the masses 1@xmath92 orders of magnitude smaller than previous estimates .",
    "@xcite studied time variability of three tev - detected agns based on _ asca _ and/or _ rxte _ observations and showed that @xmath10 black holes and internal shocks that start to develop at 100 times the schwarzschild radii could explain the observed properties .    in the gev gamma - ray band , the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope has been monitoring the whole sky with the large area telescope ( lat ) since 2008",
    "the lat is a wide field - of - view gamma - ray imager that observes one - fifth of the sky at any instant and that scans the whole sky in a day @xcite .",
    "the second _ fermi_-lat catalog , which contains 1092 ( 28 identified and 1064 associated ) agn among the 1873 detected sources in the 100mev to 100gev range @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray light curves of several tens of blazars are provided on a daily basis and this is a good database to study the time variability of blazars .",
    "@xcite reported a detailed analysis of the variability of 106 objects in the _",
    "fermi_-lat bright agn sample .",
    "they showed that the temporal behavior of gamma - ray fluxes of variable sources can be described by power - law power spectral density ( psd ) in general , with a few blazars that showed strong activity exhibiting complex and structured temporal profiles .",
    "they examined whether it was possible to characterize blazar type with the psd slope , but the results were not conclusive .    in this paper , we report the time series analysis of gamma - ray light curves of 15 blazars based on _ fermi_-lat data and discuss the results in relation to the properties of the central engine .",
    "our analysis is the first systematic study of long - term variability of blazar emission in the gamma - ray energy band , although the analysis method itself has been applied and reported previously ( ( e.g. , in the x - ray band , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use the `` monitored source light curves '' provided by the fermi science support center ( fssc ) for bright and transient gamma - ray sources .",
    "they are regularly updated throughout the mission . in this paper , we analyze the daily light curves of 15 agn ( table [ tab : psd_result ] ) in the energy range 100  mev ",
    "300  gev .",
    "the data period is between 2008 august 9 and 2012 april 26 .",
    "these sources are selected because a large fraction of data points are detections , not upper limits , so that we can extract useful information on time variability .",
    "note that the usage of daily light curves spanning 44 months naturally limits our time series analysis to the @xmath11@xmath12hz range .",
    "faster variability observed in the case of 3c 454.3 @xcite , for example , is out of the scope of the present analysis .    as we noted in section",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the variability time scale of agn flares reflects the size of the emission region , and thus the study of temporal behavior of gamma - ray flux can be a good probe to explore the physical environment close to the central engine .",
    "however , characterizing the time scale is not a simple task since we know that the intensity of gamma - ray emission from agn flares varies very irregularly .",
    "the fastest doubling time has been widely used ( see * ? ? ? * for example ) as a variability measure , but it depends on data quality and coverage .",
    "here we adopt a spectral analysis , the normalized power spectrum density ( npsd ) , to evaluate the characteristic timescale of light curves which fluctuate chaotically , after @xcite .",
    "the psd shows the degree of variation at every frequency ( or cycle ) by calculating the fourier transform of time variable data @xcite .",
    "the npsd , which is obtained by dividing the psd by the average source intensity squared , has proven to be useful to compare variability at each frequency even if the brightness changes @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath13 t}{f^2_{\\mathrm{av } } }         \\label{eq : npsd}\\\\      a(f ) & = & \\frac{1}{n } \\sum^{n-1}_{j=0}f_j \\cos(2 \\pi f t_j ) \\\\",
    "b(f ) & = & \\frac{1}{n } \\sum^{n-1}_{j=0}f_j \\sin(2 \\pi f t_j )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the source count rate at time @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is the total time length , @xmath18 is the mean value of source count rates , and @xmath19 is the error due to counting statistics . in our analysis , we calculated the power @xmath20 for some discrete frequencies given by @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is an integer and @xmath23 ) and averaged .",
    "fermi_-lat light curves are given with flux errors ( @xmath24 ) and their standard deviation ( @xmath25 ) is substituted for @xmath19 as a rough estimate of error of counting statistics ( see section [ sec : pn ] for more discussion ) .",
    "the error bars of the npsd are standard deviations of powers in each frequency bin ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more discussion of npsd analyses ) . in our calculation of the npsd",
    ", we did not use upper limits in the light curves .",
    "in addition , we did not interpolate any blank ( i.e. , missing ) data contained in the light curves .",
    "if the time series is a continuous counting rate binned into intervals , as it is here , the effect of poisson noise is to add an approximately constant amount of power to the npsd at all frequencies . at high frequencies , where the counting rate is low ,",
    "the npsd will be dominated by the flat ( white ) poisson noise spectrum . in the definition of npsd ( equation [ eq : npsd ] )",
    "this noise is subtracted in the term @xmath26 ( see * ? ? ? * for further discussion ) .    in the present case , @xmath14 ( @xmath24 )",
    "is calculated as the counts ( count error ) divided by the exposure , and the daily exposure is almost uniform for the",
    "_ fermi_-lat observations .",
    "the poisson noise is therefore approximately subtracted in the calculation of the npsd ( equation [ eq : npsd ] ) .",
    "this treatment formally assumes zero background flux , but this is a reasonable approximation in our case , since the _",
    "fermi_-lat light curves are released after subtracting background counts when they are processed at the fssc .",
    "if the subtraction of the poisson noise estimated by the quoted flux errors is not sufficiently accurate , there will be a residual constant which becomes dominant at high frequencies in the npsd , which can be seen in some cases in our results ( next section ) .",
    "we calculated the npsd for the _ fermi_-lat daily light curves of 15 agns using 9 frequency bins divided logarithmically from @xmath27  hz to @xmath28  hz .",
    "plots are shown in figure  [ fig : psd ] .",
    "one may note that data points at high frequencies are missing for most of the sources in figure  [ fig : psd ] .",
    "one reason is that many observations in the _",
    "fermi_-lat light curves yield only upper limits .",
    "another reason is that large flares which last for ten of days or more are rare : we can not have points above @xmath29  hz without such flares .",
    "we applied least - square fits to these points assuming a power - law @xmath30 and/or a broken power - law @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the frequency and @xmath33 is the `` turnover '' frequency .",
    "fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : psd_result ] .",
    "the fit lines are overplotted in figure  [ fig : psd ] , where broken power - law lines are plotted only when the reduced @xmath34 values are smaller than single power - law values .. we see npsds for four sources , pks 0537@xmath35441 , 3c279 , 3c454.3 and pks 2326@xmath35502 , are better fitted by broken power - laws than by single power - laws .",
    "the npsd plots for pks 0537@xmath35502 , 3c 279 and pks 2326@xmath35502 show upward turnovers above @xmath36  hz , @xmath37  hz and @xmath38  hz , respectively , but the slopes above these frequencies ( @xmath39 ) have large uncertainties and are consistent with zero : thus they may have reached a constant poisson - like noise level which is not removed by our rough estimate of counting statistical error ( see section [ sec : psd ] ) .",
    "we checked the difference of npsd values before and after removing the poisson noise , assuming the value of poisson noise is the normalized square - root of sum of squares of several flux s error : @xmath40 . with this procedure ,",
    "the npsd values at high frequencies showed smaller values than those before removal , but the slope above the turnover of the npsd plot remained flat ( consistent with zero slope ) .",
    "thus , even if we could not remove the effect of poisson noise completely , it seems this flattening behavior does not have a physical origin .    on the other hand , the npsd plot for 3c 454.3",
    "show a turnover at @xmath41  hz and the slope above it , @xmath42 , is well determined .",
    "the reduced @xmath34 value decreases from 1.29 for single power - law fit , which is not at acceptable level , to 0.23 for broken power - law fit , which is acceptable .",
    "thus , only the plot for 3c454.3 , which exhibited an extraordinary large flare in 2010 november @xcite , seems to show a physically meaningful turnover , at @xmath41  hz , which we discuss further in the next section .",
