    "quantum entanglement  @xcite is a fundamental property of multi - body quantum systems that shows the non - local feature of quantum states .",
    "quantum entanglement has been commonly recognized to be an essential physical resource in the implementation of high - speed quantum computation and high - security quantum communication .",
    "many efforts have been made to create entanglement between decoupled quantum systems .",
    "one natural way is to introduce a simple intermediate device  @xcite , e.g. , a single - mode field or an additional particle , whose coherent interactions with the systems lead to their indirect interactions with each other .",
    "the intermediate device can also be measured to extract information about the quantum systems for quantum feedback controls  @xcite to manipulate the entanglement dynamics .",
    "one may also utilize a dissipative environment  @xcite , e.g. , a collective decoherence environment , to generate entanglement , interacted with which the system irreversibly decays to a stationary entangled state .",
    "however , in most circumstances , quantum entanglement tends to be destructed in environments  @xcite .",
    "for example , independent decoherence channels always lead to disentanglement  @xcite that is not recoverable by local operations and classical communications .",
    "generally , non - local operations are required to effectively protect entanglement . however",
    ", a non - local hamiltonian generated from the internal interaction between quantum systems , e.g. , the dipole - dipole interaction between two atoms via the vacuum , is sometimes not a good choice , because disentanglement can also be induced by decoherence under these interactions .",
    "this paper introduces a single - mode squeezed field in a quantum cavity to realize non - local controllable interactions between two identical atoms in the weak coupling regime . by altering the parameter amplification coefficient of the squeezed field",
    ", one can continuously adjust the coupling strengths between atoms , which can be further used to control the final entanglement between the two atoms in presence of decoherence .",
    "it should be pointed out that there is another interesting work on coupling the two atoms via the squeezed vacuum  @xcite .",
    "compared with the squeezed vacuum , the auxiliary squeezed field in the cavity is more controllable , which would be helpful to control the stationary concurrence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the physical model applied in the paper is formulated in sec .",

    "<S> tunable interaction between two atoms in a cavity is realized by interacting the two atoms with an extra controllable single - mode squeezed field . </S>",
    "<S> such a controllable interaction can be further used to control entanglement between the two atoms against amplitude damping decoherence caused by spontaneous emissions . for the independent amplitude damping decoherence channel </S>",
    "<S> , entanglement will be lost completely without controls , while it can be partially preserved by the proposed strategy . for the collective amplitude damping decoherence channel , our strategy can enhance the entanglement compared with the uncontrolled case when the entanglement of the uncontrolled stationary state is not too large . </S>"
