    "the universe of dante is described by christian theology and ptolemaic astronomy .",
    "it is based on a simplified aristotelian model , where the sphere of the earth is standing still at the geometric center of the universe .",
    "the northern hemisphere is the only habitable place where man can dwell , and has mount zion at its center near jerusalem .",
    "ninety degrees to the east , one finds the river ganges , and ninety degrees to the west , the ebro in the iberian peninsula .",
    "the southern hemisphere has no dry land emerging from the immense ocean covering it and is therefore forbidden to man .",
    "however , a huge mountain lies just at its center , exactly opposite to mount zion , and so , both rivers and both mountains inscribe a cross within the sphere of the earth ( borges 1982 ) . below zion , with the form of an inverted cone , we find hell , the place where sinners are punished .",
    "it is divided into nine decreasing concentric circles which culminate at the center of the earth , and therefore also of the universe .",
    "from there , there is a crack , or narrow tunnel , opened up by the waters of the river lethe , the river of forgetfulness in hades , which connects the bottom of hell with the base of the mountain of purgatory , in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "this second realm of the afterlife , according to dante , is thus located in the midst of the unexplored ocean of the uninhabited hemisphere directly opposite to jerusalem . and ,",
    "should the souls reach the top of the mountain , they would be cleansed of all sin and made perfect , and therefore wait their turn to ascend to heaven .",
    "dedicated efforts of many people in buenos aires led to a monumental recognition for the topography of dante s cosmology , which was shaped in reinforced concrete .",
    "the barolo palace is this monument , and still today it offers a vivid and prominent example of the role played by medieval astronomy in culture in modern times .",
    "the italian architect mario palanti ( 1885 - 1979 ) was in charge of the works of the italian pavilion for the argentine centenary exhibition of 1910 . after returning to his home country and serving in the first world war , in 1919 he traveled back to argentina .",
    "this time , palanti reaches the southern hemisphere with one single idea in mind : to materialize a votive offering , in the guise of a monumental temple , honoring dante in the 600th anniversary of his death . in the past , such temples were made in order to gain favor with supernatural forces , may be the very same forces that palanti imagined pushed dante along his trip though hell , purgatory and paradise .",
    "the temple had to be located in the ascensional axis of the souls dwelling in these last two realms , in the antipodes of mount zion .",
    "in buenos aires , palanti met luis barolo and the project took shape .",
    "barolo ( 1869 - 1922 ) was an italian businessman and the needed wealthy sponsor for palanti s dream . like the architect , he was a lover of his native country and of dante , _ il sommo poeta_. moreover , like many immigrants , he was worried about international military conflicts and the necessity of preservation of european culture against the disasters of the war . having met palanti at the summit of his fortune , barolo agreed to finance palanti s project aiming to immortalize the italic culture and dante s verses .",
    "palanti wanted his future monumental building to be located in a place diametrically opposite to mount zion . but that antipodal point was very far away from the capital city of argentina .",
    "let us recall that dante and virgil , after having escaped from the abyss of hell through a natural underground passage ( the _ natural burella _ ) , emerged on the shores of an island located in the southern hemisphere , where they found the mountain of purgatory .",
    "now , jerusalem s coordinates are roughly ( 31@xmath0 47 n , 35@xmath0 13 e ) , so that its antipodes fall approximately at buenos aires correct latitude ( -34@xmath0 36 , for buenos aires city , to be precise ) but missing completely the longitude of the site ( -58@xmath0 20 for buenos aires ) .",
    "indeed , the mythic mountain , according to most of all a - bit - too - realistic topographical representations of the death realms depicted for dante s journey ( gangui 2009 ) , ought to be located at longitude -144@xmath0 47 , which clearly makes the famous mountain fall in the middle of the pacific ocean .    but this fact does not get palanti down .",
    "the architect probably recalled dante s verses ( _ inferno _ xxvi , 85 - 142 ) on ulysses last voyage to the southern hemisphere when , endangering his sailors with the aim to gain knowledge of the unknown , the hero from ithaca traverses those pillars `` where hercules his landmarks set as signals,/ that man no farther onward should adventure '' ( inf .",
    "xxvi , 108 - 109 ) . and so palanti imagines a new set of fabulous pillars of hercules , but this time in the river plate estuary .",
    "thus , he plans the construction of two votive monuments , one in each side of the river plate : the salvo palace , to be located in montevideo , uruguay , and the barolo palace on the shores of buenos aires .",
    "the palace constructed in buenos aires was conceived to be a materialization of the divine comedy . as such , it is full of allegories and symbolisms referring to dante s epic poem .",
    "for example , the building is divided vertically into three parts , exactly as the many pictorial `` representations '' depict dante s three realms of the afterlife .",
    "palanti designed the building so that it became a scale model of dante s universe , following the tradition of the gothic cathedrals , the supreme opus of stonework in the middle ages ( hilger 1993 ) .",
    "the arched walls of the ground floor passage constructed by the architect join together forming a series of vaults , with a height equivalent to three standard levels , and which are filled with latin inscriptions : from virgil s eclogues , biblical writings , ovid , horace , etc . as it was usual of palanti",
    "s eclectic constructions , the palace was conceived as a lay temple for the promotion of liberal arts .",
    "the building itself turned out to be monumental , considering the time when it was erected , of course : it comprises 22 floors and 2 basements , reaching a height of approximately 100 meters .",
    "this detail was not by chance : the divine comedy comprises exactly 100 cantos , which for dante represented the `` perfect number '' ( i.e. , 10 ) multiplied by itself ( gangui 2008 ) .",
    "the city code of the time , however , limited the maximum height allowed for new buildings along _ avenida de mayo _ in the city of buenos aires , where the palace is located , and so a special permission had to be granted .",
    "the barolo , as it is now known , set quite a few `` firsts '' , being considered the first high building of the city , and indeed the highest of latin america of its time .",
    "it continued being the highest of argentina until the construction of the kavanagh building in 1936 , and it was the first entirely made of reinforced concrete , a technique with which palanti had good experience , but which had no precedents in argentina by that time .        as soon as one leaves the ground level and its vaults ( worthy a three - story building , as we said ) and takes up the stairs , on the third floor one enters the cleansing realm of purgatory . from floor 3 to the 14th , one goes up -one `` terrace '' after the other- as dante did along the mountainside .",
    "then , after the 14th , one can climb up more seven stories through the tower of the palace , a clear allegory of the seven deadly sins to be purged in each of the terraces of purgatory . at the very top , the palace in crowned with a rotating lighthouse , the material representation of the angelic choruses of dante s paradise .",
    "this is the house of an arc lamp ( voltaic arc lamp ) of roughly 300,000 bougies ( approximately 300,000 candelas ) .",
    "all these numbers appropriately mixed together ( in a sort of numerological portrait of reality , so appreciated by pythagoreans , and therefore also by dante ) give us : 14 + 7 + 1 = 22 .",
    "now , by dividing this result by 7 ( seven deadly sins or stories through the tower ) , it yields 22/7 which is the simplest diophantine approximation of number @xmath1 , the ratio of a circle s perimeter to its diameter .",
    "again , there is no coincidence in this ; palanti twisted his design to make the circle the most perfect geometric figure ciphered within the palace s architecture .    of course",
    ", taking this `` realistic '' iconography and especially dante s own words one can not rightly say that purgatory lies `` on top of '' hell , for as we saw above these two realms are `` located '' in opposite hemispheres of the earth .",
    "dante `` the writer '' suggests this when , having arrived to the center of the earth and descended along the body of giant lucifer ( the `` fell worm who mines the world '' ) , he abruptly gets upside down after passing a certain point ( inf .",
    "xxxiv , 106 - 111 ) .",
    "surprised , dante `` the pilgrim '' asks virgil to explain to him what had happened , getting as a reply : `` [ ... ] thou still imaginest/ thou art beyond the centre , where i grasped/ the hair of the fell worm , who mines the world./ that side thou wast , so long as i descended;/ when round i turned me , thou didst pass the point/ to which things heavy draw from every side '' .",
    "dante and his guide had just gone through that special `` point '' onto which all weights converge in the search for their _ natural place _ , in the very sense aristotle conceived it .",
    "having passed to the southern hemisphere they then stopped descending and began climbing to reach the surface opposite to jerusalem : `` we mounted up , he first and i the second,/ till i beheld through a round aperture/ some of the beauteous things that heaven doth bear;/ thence we came forth to rebehold the stars . '' ( inf .",
    "xxxiv , 136 - 139 ; recall , all three canticas end with the word _ stars _ ) .",
    "the pilgrims are now ready to start the second part of their journey in purgatory .",
    "so , purgatory strictly speaking is not `` above '' hell ( within dante s architecture of the world , one can even claim that lucifer has both his head and his legs pointing `` upwards '' ) .",
    "the physical partition of the barolo palace , however , allegorically needs hell to be below all the rest , and this first realm of dante s trip is represented by the ground floor .",
    "so palanti envisioned hell as the main entrance of the palace , as it was the case for dante when he went astray ( allegorically ) in the dark wood , at the very entrance of hell ( inf .",
    "i , 1 - 3 ) . and ,",
    "like the hollow void of hell which is divided into nine infernal circles of punishment , also the central passage of the palace ( the pedestrian alley which connects two parallel streets , on the ground floor level ) has nine vaults of access : three towards _ avenida de mayo _ , which is the main entrance of the palace ; three towards the former _ victoria _ street ( now _ hiplito yrigoyen _",
    "street ) , parallel to _ avenida de mayo _ ; one given by the central vault , which stretches out towards the dome ; and two other ones that contain the staircases , on both sides of the central vault .",
    "let us note that the two staircases , on both sides of the central vault , are symmetric . hence",
    ", one of these makes the passerby go up heading for the second part of the building , namely the purgatory turning to the right , while the other makes her turn to the left .",
    "now , in the _ commedia _ there is a preferred way for the pilgrims to descend along the circles of hell , downwards to the center of the earth , and then to climb upwards along the terraces of mount purgatory ( gangui 2008 ) .    usual representations of dante s cosmos show the location on earth of two of the three landmarks of the afterlife : hell and purgatory .",
    "originated from a violent and sudden cataclysm , both parts are cone - like and complementary , as the first is a hollow void while the second is a solid mass .",
    "the descent of the pilgrims proceeds along the circles of the concave walls interior to the cavity of hell , which spiral down to the left , whereas the ascent along the convex path of the terraces of mount purgatory winds up to the right . given the inverse placement of both realms , the trajectory of the pilgrims is always in the same rectilinear direction towards the top of mount purgatory and the heavenly spheres , the empyrean and , finally , towards god ( cornish 1993 ) .",
    "this orientation during their journey is not arbitrary , but has an ancient tradition behind it .",
    "right means superior ; left , inferior . in",
    "_ genesis _ ( 13:9 ) , due to the lack of grasses and water to raise his sheep , abraham went to the right and his nephew lot to the left .",
    "christ ordained that the sheep should stay at his right hand side , while the goats should remain on his left . in _",
    "( sura 69 , ayat 13 - 31 ) , we read `` when the trumpet shall sound one blast [ ... ] on that day ye will be exposed ; not a secret of you will be hidden .",
    "[ ... ] as for him who is given his record in his right hand [ ... ] he shall be in a life of pleasure , in a lofty garden '' but , `` as for him who is given his record in his left hand [ ... ] take him and fetter him ! and burn ye him in the blazing fire ! ''",
    "it does not seem strange , then , that dante chose the path on the left when he was traversing hell , but changed to the path on his right hand side during his journey along the terraces of purgatory .",
    "however , it is clear that not both staircases of the barolo building as they were built by palanti , and can still be seen in the detailed drawing to scale of the construction can satisfy the requirement of spiraling up and to the left , for the first two floors , and then up and to the right , for the rest of the main building .",
    "tourist guides might then suggest visitors to take the appropriate staircase first , one of them and , on the third floor , the opposite one when the elevators ( nine in total , as it should be ) are not operating properly .",
    "from the garden of eden the earthly paradise on top of mount purgatory located just below the aristotelian sphere of fire , it is beatrice who guides dante along the last leg of his ultra mundane travel , through the nine celestial spheres of heaven .",
    "let us recall that virgil , as a pagan , had forbidden access to paradise ( inf .",
    "iv , 39 ) , and was forever obliged to remain in limbo , the first circle of hell . the paradise is the abode of angels and saints , and was structured , according to judeo - christian tradition , by the classical nine concentric , spherical and incorruptible , heavens : the eight astronomical ptolemaic `` spheres '' plus the aristotelian primum mobile . surrounding this all",
    ", there was the empyrean , as the tenth and last theological sphere , infinite and motionless , made just of light and beyond space and time , as its dwelling was in the mind of god .",
    "one sphere after the other the pilgrims pass from the heaven of the moon to that of saturn . once in this last heaven ,",
    "dante and beatrice are ready to `` jump '' into the sphere of the stars .",
    "it is in fact at this moment that the poet hints to us his probable date of birth . in canto xxii ,",
    "106 - 111 of paradise , dante speaks directly to the reader and tells her that he saw the constellation following taurus , namely gemini .",
    "then , suddenly , faster than when you put `` thy finger in the fire and drawn it out again '' , he found himself inside of this new constellation .    in the following verses , he sings to `` his '' stars : `` o glorious stars , o light impregnated/ with mighty virtue , from which i acknowledge/ all of my genius , whatsoeer it be,/ with you was born , and hid himself with you,/ he who is father of all mortal life,/ when first i tasted of the tuscan air '' ( par .",
    "xxii , 112 - 117 ) .",
    "few people have ever written to themselves a more poetic and touching `` birth certificate '' .",
    "what the poet is telling us with these verses is that , in conjunction with the constellation gemini , it rose and set that celestial body who is `` father of all mortal life '' the sun when dante breathed the air of tuscany for the first time , namely at his birthday . from his own words , then , one can narrow dante s birth date to between may 22 and june 21 , 1965 , approximately .",
    "so , gemini seems to be dante s own constellation and birth sign , and it is from it that he afterwards carries on with his trip through the heavens . in a sense , we see here that dante enters the higher spheres of paradise through this `` door '' .",
    "however , common wisdom surrounding the barolo history takes the southern cross as dante s `` gateway to the heavens '' ( hilger 1996 ) .",
    "there is indeed a famous passage in purgatorio related to some `` four stars '' which not few commentators relate to the constellation crux .",
    "let us read dante s verses ; we will comment on them below : `` the beauteous planet , that to love incites,/ was making all the orient to laugh,/ veiling the fishes that were in her escort./ to the right hand i turned , and fixed my mind/ upon the other pole , and saw four stars/ neer seen before save by the primal people./ rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven./ o thou septentrional and widowed site,/ because thou art deprived of seeing these!/ when from regarding them i had withdrawn,/ turning a little to the other pole,/ there where the wain had disappeared already '' ( pur .",
    "i , 19 - 30 ) .        in these verses , the `` beauteous planet , that to love incites '' refers , of course , to planet venus , which , in dante s vision , dominated with its light the eastern sky and covered with its luminosity the constellation pisces ( the fish ) that escorted it .",
    "let us recall that dante had started his trip during eastern , namely , when the sun lies in aries ( the ram ) , according to the traditional zodiac .",
    "aries is the sign bordering with pisces .",
    "hence , the fact that venus which is located always close to the sun appears in the eastern sky tells us that it is dawn . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that `` the beauteous planet '' appears on pisces indicates precisely that this constellation rose from the eastern horizon before aries ( and also before the sun ) .",
    "these details , together with many others hinted by dante during his hasty voyage though the circles of hell , tell us that the pilgrims are enjoying the dawn of resurrection ( or easter ) day , during their fourth day since the beginning of their trip .",
    "what does dante mean by writing that he `` saw four stars neer seen before save by the primal people '' ?",
    "could he be referring to the southern cross ?",
    "can we think that dante knew , _ circa _ 1300 , that small constellation so characteristic of the southern hemisphere , and that many of us employ regularly to find the celestial south pole ?",
    "moreover , can we infer from this that palanti wanted `` his '' palace to incorporate some feature allegorically related to the cross ?",
    "it may seem surprising that the poet , who never traveled southwards far enough during his european wanderings , knew this group of southern stars not accessible from florence .",
    "he might , however , have had news about these stars in indirect ways , as ptolemy s _ almagest _ was known to him , apparently not directly , but through alfraganus _ compendium of astronomy_. and in the _ almagest _ these stars indeed appeared , not as a cross , but as part of the constellation centaurus",
    ".    however , it might also be that dante `` invented '' these stars right away , with no relation to an existing star catalogue or travelers description whatsoever .",
    "to support this view , we have his explicit words `` four stars neer seen before save by the primal people '' which might mean that only the inhabitants of the garden of eden , `` the primal people '' adam and eve could have seen them , but not the rest of `` their descendants '' .",
    "moreover , the poet just mentions the `` four stars '' but says nothing whether these formed part of an astronomical asterism or constellation .",
    "nonetheless , one can be pretty sure that palanti wanted some celestial allegory to be attached to the highest and more divine part of the votive temple he built .",
    "the lighthouse , representing the nine angelical choruses surrounding god , with its powerful light that could be seen from the opposite shore of the river plate , had certainly some role in guiding the european pilgrims towards the south , towards this promised land he might have thought buenos aires would be , and away from the old continent that would soon be devastated by a new world war . eventually , as an astronomical guide for pilgrims and travelers heading south , the cross was the most appropriate `` sign '' in the sky ( gangui 2009 ) .    however , if palanti really wanted those powerful twin beacons , the salvo palace ( in montevideo ) and the barolo palace ( on the argentine shore ) to be related to dante s entrance gate to the heavens , he probably should have thought more in dante s `` glorious stars '' , specially in the twins castor and pollux ( pur .",
    "iv , 61 ) placed in `` leda s lovely nest '' , namely in gemini , his birth sign , rather than in the southern cross ; the latter being a constellation dante probably never saw with his own eyes and , may be , did not even cross his mind either ."
