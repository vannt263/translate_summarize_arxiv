    "the identification of large , unbiased samples of members of star - forming regions is important for studying in detail the birth and early evolution of stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "complete membership lists are essential ingredients in the analysis of data on circumstellar disks , x - ray emission , multiplicity , rotation , and kinematics .",
    "most importantly , a thorough spectroscopic census of a young population provides a measurement of the initial mass function ( imf ) from massive stars down to brown dwarfs , as recently demonstrated for taurus , ic  348 , ophiuchus , and the trapezium cluster @xcite . for measuring the imf ,",
    "these spectroscopic surveys complement alternative methods such as luminosity function modeling , which have proven successful in constraining the imfs of the more compact and denser clusters @xcite .",
    "the young cluster ic  348 is well - suited for a membership survey .",
    "the cluster is young ( 2  myr ) , nearby ( 315  pc ) , rich ( @xmath9  members ) , compact ( @xmath10 ) , and most of its members exhibit relatively low extinction ( @xmath11 - 4 ) . as a result",
    ", a large fraction of the membership can be identified down to very low masses through efficient observations of a small area of sky that can be performed at both optical and infrared ( ir ) wavelengths .",
    "previous searches for members of ic  348 have utilized proper motion measurements @xcite , optical spectroscopy and photometry @xcite , ir photometry @xcite , imaging in h@xmath12 @xcite , extensive spectroscopy and photometry at optical and ir wavelengths @xcite , and narrow - band ir photometry @xcite ( hereafter ntc00 ) .",
    "the membership information and spectral types from these studies have provided an important basis for recent work in ic  348 on multiplicity @xcite , near - ir and millimeter disk emission @xcite , variability @xcite , and x - ray emission @xcite .    in this paper , we present our latest results in a continuing effort to identify all of the stellar and substellar members of ic  348 .",
    "we use new data at @xmath0 and @xmath1 and recently published near - ir photometry to select candidate members of the cluster across a larger area and down to lower masses than in previous surveys .",
    "we describe spectroscopy of these candidates and evaluate the membership status of all objects toward ic  348 that have been observed spectroscopically in this work and in previous studies . for this list of known cluster members",
    ", we estimate extinctions , luminosities , and effective temperatures , and construct a hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram . using the evolutionary models that provide the best agreement with observational constraints for young stars @xcite ( hereafter bcah98 and cbah00 ) , we infer individual masses and derive an imf for the cluster , which is compared to the mass functions in other star - forming regions and open clusters .",
    "images of the ic  348 cluster were obtained with the cfh12k camera on the canada - france - hawaii telescope on the night of 1999 september 30 .",
    "the instrument contained twelve @xmath13 ccds separated by @xmath14 and arranged in a @xmath15 mosaic .",
    "with a plate scale of @xmath16  pixel@xmath17 , the total field of view was @xmath2 .",
    "images were obtained with exposure times of 1 , 30 , and 900  s through the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters at one pointing centered at @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( j2000 ) .",
    "data from various targets during the observing run were used to construct sky flat field frames .",
    "the ic  348 images were bias subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "a typical point source in these images exhibited a fwhm of three pixels , or @xmath20 .",
    "photometry and image coordinates of the sources in these data were measured with daofind and phot under the iraf package apphot . for most stars ,",
    "aperture photometry was extracted with a radius of six pixels .",
    "smaller apertures were used for closely separated stars .",
    "the photometry was calibrated in the cousins @xmath0 system by combining data for standards across a range of colors @xcite with the appropriate aperture and airmass corrections .",
    "the transmission profile for the @xmath1 filter is described by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 data were calibrated by assuming @xmath21 for a0 standard stars .",
    "this type of calibration is sufficient since the analysis in this study relies only on the relative precision of the @xmath1 photometry . to compare our @xmath1 photometry to data from another instrument",
    ", one would need to calibrate the latter in the manner applied to our data and to account for any differences in the filter and instrument transmission profiles .",
    "saturation in the 1  sec exposures occurred near magnitudes of 11 - 12 in both filters .",
    "the completeness limits of the long exposures were @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "typical photometric uncertainties were 0.04  mag at @xmath24 and @xmath25 and 0.1  mag at @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the plate solution was derived from coordinates measured in the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) spring 1999 release point source catalog for stars that appeared in the optical images and were not saturated .",
    "the 241 targets of our new spectroscopy are listed in table  [ tab : log ] , which are selected in   [ sec : cand ] .",
    "the gratings and spectral resolutions for these data are also provided in table  [ tab : log ] . during the observations with the keck low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; @xcite ) , we used both the long - slit and multi - slit modes .",
    "all long - slit spectra were obtained with the slit rotated to the parallactic angle .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 60 to 3600  s. after bias subtraction and flat - fielding , the spectra were extracted and calibrated in wavelength with arc lamp data .",
    "the spectra were then corrected for the sensitivity functions of the detectors , which were measured from observations of spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "in addition to the optical data , we obtained @xmath28-band spectra of a small sample of objects using the near - ir long - slit spectrometer fspec @xcite .",
    "these data were collected at the mmt observatory on 2000 december 7 .",
    "sources were stepped through four positions along the slit . at each position , the integration times ranged between 30 and 120  s. at one grating setting , we obtained a spectrum extending from 2.0 to 2.4  with a two - pixel resolution of @xmath29 .",
    "we observed a nearby a0  v star ( hr  1019 ) , which acted as the telluric standard .",
    "after dark subtraction and flat - fielding , adjacent images along the slit were subtracted from each other to remove sky emission .",
    "the sky - subtracted images were aligned and combined , during which most bad pixels and cosmic rays were rejected .",
    "a spectrum was extracted from this final image , divided by the extracted a0  v standard spectrum , and wavelength calibrated using oh airglow lines .",
    "the intrinsic spectral slope of the telluric standard was removed with an artificial blackbody spectrum of @xmath30  k.    among the several dozen candidate members of ic  348 that were observed spectroscopically by @xcite , only sources with spectral types of m4 or later were presented in that study .",
    "the 42 stars that were earlier than m4 are included in table  [ tab : log ] .",

    "previous studies have searched for members of ic  348 through measurements of proper motions @xcite , imaging in h@xmath12 emission @xcite , ir luminosity functions @xcite , and optical color - magnitude diagrams @xcite .",
    "we extend the latter surveys to greater depth and to a larger area of the cluster by including our new @xmath0 and @xmath1 data .",
    "we have focused our membership survey on the @xmath6 region centered at @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( j2000 ) , which is indicated in figure  [ fig : map ] .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams and completeness analysis (   [ sec : complete ] ) apply to this area .    to identify the stars toward ic  348 that have both the colors and the absolute photometry expected of cluster members , we have constructed extinction - corrected diagrams of @xmath33 versus @xmath34 and @xmath35 versus @xmath34 in the manner described by @xcite .",

    "[ sec : adopt ] .",
    "when the known members of ic  348 are placed on a h - r diagram , most of them appear above the model isochrone for an age of 10  myr from @xcite @xcite . in the diagrams of @xmath33 versus @xmath34 and @xmath35 versus @xmath34 in figure  [",

    "although we focused on the @xmath6 field in figure  [ fig : map ] , a small number of the targets are outside of this area .",
    "we also obtained spectra for 49 objects from previous studies to improve their spectral type measurements .",
    "young stars that are observed only in scattered light ( e.g. , edge - on disks ) can appear well below the cluster sequence in a color - magnitude diagram @xcite . as a result , such sources are rejected as field stars when candidate members are selected through color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "however , scattered - light objects can be identified through other indicators of youth , such as the presence of reflection nebulosity , variability , emission in h@xmath12 and in x - rays , and excess emission at near- and mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "after checking the stars below the boundaries in figure  [ fig : col ] for these signatures , we found that sources 203 and 435 were detected in x - rays by @xcite and have near - ir excess emission .",
    "the former was also detected in the h@xmath12 survey of @xcite .",
    "these two stars were included in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "many of the above targets were observed with multi - slit spectroscopy . after designing a slit mask for a set of these objects",
    ", we included additional slitlets as space allowed for stars that were below one or both of the boundaries in figure  [ fig : col ] .",
    "the highest priority was given to stars that appeared to be m - type by the data from ntc00 or that were just below the boundaries . in this way",
    ", useful spectra were obtained for 69 objects .      in this section",
    ", we measure spectral types for the 268 objects toward ic  348 that we observed spectroscopically .",
    "we then evaluate the membership of each candidate with the spectral types , spectral features ( h@xmath12 , na  i , k  i ) , and photometry . for determining spectral types and membership , we used low - resolution optical spectroscopy from 6000 to 9000   .",
    "at the m spectral types that are expected for most of the members of ic  348 , the k  i and na  i absorption lines vary significantly between dwarfs and pre - main - sequence stars @xcite . because these features are easily detected in low - resolution spectra , higher - resolution data for li were unnecessary for distinguishing young members from field dwarfs among most of the candidates .",
    "meanwhile , for faint m - type sources , both high sensitivity and accurate spectral types can be achieved with low spectral resolution .",
    "for a few objects with earlier spectral types , we included ir spectroscopy to better constrain the classifications .",
    "the low - resolution optical spectra of early - type dwarfs and giants ( @xmath38k0 ) exhibit only a few absorption lines ( h@xmath12 , ca  ii ) and are otherwise featureless . as a result ,",
    "the uncertainties in spectral types are largest at these types .",
    "in fact , we can classify some objects as only  early - type \" or  giant \" . in",
    "most of those cases , such a classification is sufficiently accurate to indicate that an object is a background star .",
    "however , for g and early k types , we can not confidently distinguish between giants , dwarfs , and pre - main sequence stars based on the low - resolution optical data . because absorption in the @xmath28-band co band heads is much stronger in the former than in the latter two",
    ", we obtained @xmath28-band spectra of some of the stars with these ambiguous classifications and compared the data to those of standard dwarfs and giants @xcite to distinguish background giants from dwarfs and pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "in addition , we measured the strength of li absorption at 6707    for one these stars through moderate - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "there remains one star of this kind that lacks ir spectra or li data and thus has an uncertain classification (   [ sec : append1a ] )",
    ".    for k and m - type field dwarfs and for k0-m5 members of ic  348 , we measured spectral types by comparison to the spectra of standard dwarfs from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "spectral types for members later than m5 were derived with the averages of dwarf and giant spectra as described by @xcite . the same system has been used in classifying young late - type objects in taurus @xcite , mbm  12a @xcite , ophiuchus @xcite , and ic  348 @xcite .",

    "stars projected against ic  348 can be background stars , foreground stars , or young members of the cluster .",
    "we now evaluate the membership status of all objects toward ic  348 that have been observed spectroscopically in this work and in previous studies .",
    "members of ic  348 can be identified by several indicators .",
    "nine of the brightest stars toward ic  348 have relative proper motions that imply membership in the cluster @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the deeper proper motion measurements of @xcite can not reliably distinguish members from background stars . because ic  348 is a star - forming cluster , objects that show evidence of youth are likely to be members of the cluster .",
    "signatures of youth include h@xmath12 emission above the levels observed for active field dwarfs ( @xmath41    for m types ) , br@xmath42 emission , ir excess emission in photometry or spectra , and spectral features implying low gravity .",
    "examples of the latter are k  i , na  i , and the overall shape of the red optical spectra , which differ noticeably between dwarfs and pre - main - sequence objects at spectral types later than m2 .",
    "finally , for a given star , the presence of significant reddening in the spectrum or colors ( @xmath43 ) and a position above the main sequence for the distance of ic  348 indicate that it can not be in the foreground or the background of the cluster , respectively , and therefore must be a member of the cluster .",
    "field dwarfs in the foreground of ic  348 have large proper motions relative to cluster members or background stars , and thus are easily identified in proper motion surveys @xcite .",
    "foreground dwarfs are also characterized by little or no reddening , strong absorption in the optical na  i and k  i transitions at m types , and a lack of li absorption or any other indicator of youth .",
    "field stars in the background of ic  348 consist of dwarfs and giants . at brighter levels ,",
    "most background stars are giants and early - type dwarfs . however , because of the depth of our spectroscopy , we detected a large number of background field m dwarfs as well .",
    "background dwarfs fall below the main sequence if placed on the h - r diagram for the distance of the cluster .",
    "these m dwarfs also can be identified by their strong absorption in na  i and k  i , just as for foreground dwarfs .",
    "for some of the m - type stars falling below the main sequence , we can not use these features to confirm their nature as field dwarfs because of insufficient signal - to - noise in the spectra . as discussed in   [ sec : cand ] , young stars that are seen in scattered light can appear low on the h - r diagram , even below the main sequence . as a result , some of the objects that we identify as background m dwarfs could be scattered - light members of ic  348 .",
    "however , these stars show none of the signatures of youth mentioned at the end of   [ sec : cand ] .",
    "we list the spectral types from this work and from previous studies for objects that we classify as members of ic  348 , as foreground stars , and as background stars in tables  [ tab : mem ] , [ tab : fore ] , and [ tab : back ] , respectively .",
    "the evidence for the assigned membership status of each member and foreground star is provided .",
    "the background stars were identified by either a position below the main sequence and a lack of youth indicators or by a classification as a giant .",

    "a few mistakes in the cross - identifications from ntc00 and @xcite have been corrected here . in our new spectroscopic sample of 268 objects ,",
    "there are 47 members that have previously published spectra , 122 newly confirmed members ( 15 later than m6 ) , 97 field stars , and two stars with uncertain membership status .",
    "additional comments on the spectral and membership classifications of individual sources are in ",

    ", we assess the completeness of the new census of members within the @xmath6 field toward ic  348 that is shown in figure  [ fig : map ] .",

    "next , we use this diagram to identify candidate members among the stars that lack spectroscopy in the @xmath6 field . at @xmath44",
    ", we can not use the boundaries in figure  [ fig : col ] to reliably separate field stars and candidate members because the photometric uncertainties are too large .",
    "therefore , we apply this diagram only to stars with @xmath45 .",
    "objects that are above this limit and that fall below either of the boundaries in figure  [ fig : col ] are likely to be field stars , and thus are not shown .",
    "similarly , we also omit stars that appear below the boundary in the diagram of @xmath46 versus @xmath0 from @xcite .",
    "the one exception is 2mass  03444520 + 3201197 , which falls below the boundary in @xmath35 versus @xmath34 , but is surrounded by reflection nebulosity in our @xmath0 and @xmath1 images , and thus is probably a cluster member observed in scattered light .",
    "sources that are earlier than m2 by the narrow - band photometry of ntc00 and that have @xmath47 - 16 are likely field stars as well ( see figure  [ fig : nic ] ) . after rejecting these field stars , in figure  [ fig : col ] there remain 23 candidate members in the @xmath6 field that have not been observed with spectroscopy . in comparison ,",
    "261 cluster members have been confirmed in this region in this work and previous studies (   [ sec : mem ] ) .",
    "because the mass and reddening vectors are roughly perpendicular in a near - ir color - magnitude diagram and because cool and reddened sources are most easily detected at near - ir wavelengths , we use the diagram of @xmath48 versus @xmath34 in figure  [ fig : jh ] to evaluate the completeness of the current census in terms of mass and extinction .",
    "the photometry in figure  [ fig : jh ] is compiled from references in   [ sec : adopt ] .",
    "the deepest of those data sets is from @xcite , which encompassed the entire @xmath6 field .",
    "the completeness limits of the photometry from @xcite are taken to be the magnitudes at which the logarithm of the number of sources as a function of magnitude departs from a linear slope and begins to turn over ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : jh ] , we have plotted the reddening vectors from @xmath11 - 4 for cluster members with masses of 0.03 and 0.08  @xmath36 and ages of 3 and 10  myr , where the latter is the maximum age implied by the h - r diagram of the cluster (   [ sec : hr ] ) .",
    "these vectors are derived in the manner described by @xcite with the evolutionary models of cbah00 for the distance of ic  348 .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : jh ] , the ir photometric data should be complete for members of ic  348 with @xmath7 and @xmath5 , with the exception of close companions .    in figure",
    "[ fig : jh ] , we omit known and likely field stars in the same manner as in figure  [ fig : col ] .",
    "the remaining ir sources consist of confirmed members and objects that lack spectroscopic data .",
    "the latter are divided into candidate members from figure  [ fig : col ] , stars with uncertain optical photometry ( @xmath44 ) , and sources detected only in the ir data . in figure",
    "[ fig : jh ] , there are only three objects that lack spectral classifications and that would have @xmath52 and @xmath5 if they were members ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , all of which are candidate members by figure  [ fig : col ] . because of the small number of these candidates , the current sample of confirmed members is nearly complete for these extinction and mass limits .",
    "therefore , in   [ sec : imf ] , we will derive the imf from a sample of known members defined by @xmath5 and we will refer to 0.03  @xmath36 as the completeness limit . just as this survey is incomplete for low - mass members with high extinction ( @xmath55 ) , it is not sensitive to objects that are seen in scattered light ( e.g. , edge - on disks ) , particularly those at low - masses .      using the spectral type and membership data compiled in   [ sec : class ] , we evaluate the survey for low - mass members of ic  348 by ntc00 . in that study ,",

    "we mark the objects that have spectra for the first time from this work , two of which , 603 and 624 , had been previously reported as candidate low - mass members @xcite .",
    "next , we indicate the nicmos sources that are field stars by the spectroscopic analysis of the previous section or by the positions in the color - magnitude diagrams in figure  [ fig : col ] and in @xcite .",
    "several objects that appear to have spectral types of late m by the nicmos data  and thus were taken as probable low - mass members by ntc00  are field stars .",

    "we now investigate the accuracy and precision of the spectral types that were estimated from the nicmos narrow - band photometry by ntc00 . in figure",

    "most of the ground - based spectral types are derived from optical data .",
    "the small number of ir types included here were measured with optically - classified standards .",
    "therefore , the ground - based classifications are assured to be accurate , and in fact effectively define the spectral types for young objects at late m types . as for the precision of the optical spectral types ,",
    "the measurement errors are @xmath69 subclass or less for most of the objects in question .",
    "the accuracy of the nicmos spectral types is illustrated in figure  [ fig : comp ] , where the nicmos classifications are systematically later than those measured from the optical data by an average of @xmath70 - 2  subclasses .",
    "the spectral type calibration of the nicmos measurements was derived from both optically - classified members of ic  348 and field dwarf standards .",
    "the offset in classifications in figure  [ fig : comp ] is probably due to differences in the steam band strengths between dwarfs and young objects at a given spectral type , which is a behavior that has been noticed previously @xcite .",
    "the precision of the nicmos spectral types is quantified by the measurement errors reported by ntc00 , which are largest for early types and for faint objects ; the nicmos types at @xmath38m2 are uncertain because little steam absorption is present at higher temperatures , as pointed out by ntc00 , while the increase in errors at faint levels is a reflection of photometric uncertainties .",
    "as demonstrated in the novel study of ntc00 , measurements of near - ir steam absorption through narrow - band photometry can be used to efficiently identify cool objects that may be low - mass members of a dense cluster . however , to arrive at an accurate calibration of spectral types , optically - classified young m - type objects rather than m dwarfs should be used as the spectral type standards . as narrow - band photometry does not distinguish between cool field stars and cool members , membership of candidates should be confirmed through other means ( e.g. , spectroscopy , proper motions ) . in addition , useful estimates of spectral types can be derived only well above the detection limit where the photometry is accurate .",
    "in this section , we begin by tabulating photometry and spectral types for all known members of the ic  348 cluster and estimating their extinctions , effective temperatures , and bolometric luminosities (   [ sec : adopt ] ,   [ sec : ext ] ,   [ sec : teff ] ) .",

    "the imfs from @xcite and this work are generally consistent with each other .",
    "for instance , both imf measurements exhibit peaks near 0.1 - 0.2  @xmath4 . the uncertainties in the imf of @xcite are largest below the hydrogen burning limit because of the rapidly increasing contamination by background stars at the fainter levels of the ir luminosity functions .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite used optical and ir photometry from the guide star catalog and 2mass to identify candidate members within a radius of @xmath103 from the cluster center .",
    "they estimated masses for these candidates by combining @xmath28 photometry , evolutionary models , and the mean age and extinction for cluster members .",
    "we find several problems in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "first , the assumption of fixed values for extinction and age for the cluster members is overly simplified , as demonstrated by the scatter in the sequence for ic  348 on the h - r diagram and the range of extinctions that we derive .",
    "second , to correct for field star contamination in their sample of candidate cluster members , they subtracted data from off - cluster control fields . however , to properly correct for field stars in this way , one must estimate the distribution of extinctions toward background stars in the cluster field , apply extinction to the data from the control field to duplicate that reddening distribution , and then perform the subtraction .",
    "@xcite did not apply an extinction model to their control field , which is especially necessary when optical data are involved .",
    "finally , their imf sample , like that of ntc00 later in this section , is susceptible to a bias against low - mass sources because it includes all candidate members rather than only those within an extinction threshold .    in the empirical h - r diagram constructed from the narrowband steam measurements",
    ", ntc00 assumed that objects appearing near the cluster sequence were members . from these sources , they derived an imf that was reported to be complete to the deuterium burning limit ( @xmath104 for @xmath105 , 0.013 - 0.015  @xmath36 ; @xcite ) .",
    "how do our findings in   [ sec : najita ] regarding the membership and spectral types of the nicmos sources affect the imf reported by ntc00 ? at @xmath65 , photometric uncertainties in the nicmos narrow - band photometry translated into very large errors in the estimated spectral types .",
    "consequently , several field stars were mistaken for objects with spectral types of late m. in addition , because the spectral types from the steam data were systematically too late by 1 - 2 subclasses , the masses were underestimated .",
    "an offset of one subclass in the substellar regime corresponds to a change of a factor of @xmath106 in the inferred mass .",
    "these two effects both resulted in an overestimate of the number of brown dwarfs by ntc00 . in figure  [ fig : comp ] , 28 sources have nicmos classifications later than m6 , when only 9 of these sources actually have optical spectral types in that range .",
    "ntc00 concluded that their spectral types were accurate down to @xmath107 , or the brightness of objects at the deuterium burning mass limit for the average age and extinction of cluster members ( 3  myr , @xmath105 ) .",
    "this mass was thus quoted as the completeness limit of their imf for the nicmos fields in ic  348 . however ,",
    "if an imf sample includes all probable members , as in ntc00 , then the mass completeness limit is the lowest mass at which the sample is complete to the _ maximum _ age and extinction . to be representative of the population down to the deuterium burning limit , an imf from the data of ntc00 would need to contain only sources with ages and reddenings below the mean values .",
    "in addition , it is not clear that their spectral classifications are sufficiently accurate down to @xmath107 for mass estimates and for the measurement of an imf ; the average uncertainties for the spectral types reported by ntc00 are @xmath108 subclasses for types later than m2 with @xmath109 to 16.5 . indeed , in ",
    "[ sec : najita ] we showed that at least two objects at @xmath110 with nicmos classifications later than m6 are field stars .",
    "also , because of the large uncertainties in both their spectral types and dereddened @xmath28 magnitudes , the cluster sequence overlaps with the field star population ( figure  [ fig : nic ] ) . without a clear separation of the two populations or other membership information ,",
    "the low - mass members can not be reliably identified and added into the imf . given these various issues , the imf from ntc00 is probably not accurate in the substellar regime or complete to the deuterium burning mass limit .      by using methods similar to those in this study , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite surveyed 8.4  deg@xmath111 in the taurus star - forming region and arrived at a census of members that is complete for @xmath112 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite presented an imf from the 92 taurus members within this extinction threshold and in the survey fields .",
    "we now compare that imf sample for taurus to the one that we have defined for ic  348 . because of the vertical nature of the mass tracks for low - mass stars on the h - r diagram , the spectral types of young objects should be well - correlated with their masses .",
    "very little evolution in temperature is expected between the ages of taurus and ic  348 ( 1 and 2  myr ) , implying virtually identical relations between spectral types and masses for these two populations .",
    "in addition , a spectral type is a simple , observable quantity that can be measured to good accuracy with relative ease , particularly at m types .",
    "therefore , we use the distributions of spectral types for ic  348 and taurus as imf proxies that can be compared in a straightforward , reliable fashion without the involvement of evolutionary models .",

    "the distribution for ic  348 reaches a maximum at m5 , while primary and secondary peaks appear at k7 and m5 in taurus .",
    "spectral types of m5 and k7 correspond to masses near 0.15 and 0.8  @xmath4 for ages of a few million years by the models of bcah98 .",
    "the spectral type distributions for ic  348 and taurus provide clear , unambiguous evidence for a significant variation of the imf with star - forming conditions .",
    "previous studies have noted that a difference of this kind might be present between taurus and clusters like orion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , most previous samples of members of star - forming regions have been derived by combining disparate surveys that utilized biased selection techniques ( e.g. , h@xmath12 , ir excess ) .",
    "it was unclear whether the predominance of k7 and m0 stars in taurus was an accurate reflection of the region or simply a result of incompleteness at later types .",
    "but because of the new magnitude - limited membership surveys in ic  348 and taurus , we have been able to make the first comparison of spectral type distributions in which the samples are complete down to late spectral types and contain relatively large numbers of members .",
    "when the data for the samples in ic  348 and taurus are transformed to individual masses with evolutionary models (   [ sec : imf348 ] ; @xcite ) , the imfs in figure  [ fig : imf ] are produced . because the same techniques and evolutionary models were employed in converting from data to masses for each population",
    ", we can be confident in the validity of any differences we find in the imfs for ic  348 and taurus .",
    "the imf for taurus peaks near 0.8  @xmath4 and steadily declines to lower masses .",
    "while two peaks are present in the distribution of spectral types for taurus , only one is found at a significant level in the imf . apparently , the bimodal appearance of the spectral type distribution is simply the product of stellar evolution convolved with the particular form of single - peaked imf found in taurus .",
    "meanwhile , the mass function for ic  348 rises from high masses down to a solar mass in a roughly salpeter fashion , rises more slowly down to a maximum at 0.1 - 0.2  @xmath4 , and then declines into the substellar regime .",
    "we have quantified the significance of the differences in the distributions of spectral types and masses for ic  348 and taurus by performing a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test between the distributions for spectral types of @xmath114m8 and for masses of @xmath7 . in terms of both spectral types and masses ,",

    "it is unlikely that the imfs of single objects  both isolated sources and individual components of multiple systems  in ic  348 and taurus are the same and these observed differences are simply the result of dynamical effects , such as more frequent stripping of low - mass companions in the denser environment of ic  348 .",
    "companions at separations greater than @xmath71 and @xmath116 in ic  348 and taurus , respectively , were included in both imfs . as a result , the disruption of wide binaries should have no effect on our results as long as the components remain within the cluster , which is likely for these loosely bound systems . in order for the spectral type distributions for all objects earlier than m9 to be the same in taurus and ic  348 , enormous numbers of m stars",
    "would need to be hidden as close companions in taurus ( @xmath117 per primary ) .",
    "in addition , if the taurus imf is computed for only the most compact aggregate , l1495e , which has a stellar density only five times lower than that of ic  348 , than the imf variations between these two regions persist .",
    "finally , out of the various types of stellar populations in which mass functions are measured , star - forming clusters with low to moderate stellar densities like taurus and ic  348 are the least likely sites to be affected significantly by dynamical evolution .",
    "for instance , in ic  348 , the crossing time of a star moving at the escape velocity ( @xmath118  km  s@xmath17 , @xcite ) is comparable to the age of the cluster ( 2  myr ) .",
    "when the members of ic  348 were younger and less evolved , they likely had even lower velocities than they do now , as indicated by the protostellar clumps in this cluster @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the imfs derived for taurus and ic  348 are sensitive to the adopted temperature scale and evolutionary models . the combination used here",
    "was designed to produce the best agreement with the various observational constraints (   [ sec : append2 ] ) . in particular",
    ", the imfs above @xmath119  @xmath4 should be fairly accurate since our choices of temperature scale and models implies masses from the h - r diagram that are consistent with the dynamical mass estimates of young stars .",
    "however , because fewer constraints are available at low masses , the imfs below @xmath119  @xmath4 could be subject to systematic errors .",
    "even with the extensive spectroscopic work that has been done in orion , one can define a well - populated sample of members that is complete down to only mid - m types in that region . to extend the imf in orion to lower masses",
    ", studies have relied on luminosity function modeling @xcite . as a result , a comparison of the imfs in taurus and ic  348 to that in orion is less definitive than the comparison between the first two regions .",

    "the imf from @xcite peaks near 0.6  @xmath4 and is roughly flat to lower masses , and thus differs somewhat from the imf for ic  348 in figure  [ fig : imf ] .",
    "it is unclear whether this difference is real or is the result of a shortcoming in the merging of the spectroscopic data and the luminosity function modeling for the trapezium .",
    "meanwhile , the imfs for ic  348 and the trapezium derived from luminosity function modeling are similar @xcite , but do allow for subtle variations of this type . to reliably compare these imfs at this level of detail , the completeness limit of the spectroscopic work in the trapezium must be extended to later spectral types .",
    "the data for the trapezium and other young clusters are more amenable to a comparison of the global properties of the imfs .",

    "note that this measurement of @xmath126 is consistent with the value implied by the luminosity function modeling of @xcite .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : ratios ] , the relative numbers of high- and low - mass stars in ic  348 are similar to those found in the trapezium and in the open clusters , while the frequency of brown dwarfs appears to be lower in ic  348 than in the trapezium and near the value for taurus .",
    "the imf measured for the ophiuchus star - forming cluster , which is comparable to ic  348 in stellar density ( @xmath127 - 1000  pc@xmath128 ) , is consistent with that of ic  348 @xcite . however , because the number statistics are relatively poor in the data for ophiuchus , we do not include it in table  [ tab : ratios ] .",
    "the implications of the variations in the imf among taurus , the trapezium , and the open clusters for models of the imf were discussed by @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the lower frequency of brown dwarfs in taurus relative to the trapezium could reflect differences in the typical jeans masses of the two regions .",
    "this scenario continues to be plausible when the data for ic  348 are included .",
    "ic  348 contains a much higher frequency of low - mass stars ( 0.1 - 0.2  @xmath36 ) than taurus , but a comparable fraction of brown dwarfs , which would imply an average jeans mass for ic  348 that is intermediate between those of taurus and the trapezium .",
    "the observed imf variations between taurus and ic348 might also be explained through the recent model of turbulent fragmentation by @xcite . in those calculations , the imf peaks at a higher mass for lower values of the gas density and the mach number .",
    "indeed , taurus exhibits a higher peak mass than ic  348 and is less dense and more quiescent than most star - forming regions .",
    "meanwhile , these variations would seem difficult to explain with models in which the shape of the imf is determined by the competition between accretion and outflows @xcite . the significant variation that we find in the imf ,",
    "which is particularly well - established between taurus and ic  348 , comprises a new and important test for any model of the imf .",
    "the x - ray properties of young stars in ic  348 have been described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "we now examine the nature of the remaining 64 x - ray detections .",
    "most of the 39 x - ray sources that lack counterparts in available optical and ir data are probably in the background of ic  348 and unrelated to the cluster @xcite .",
    "one x - ray source , object 77 , is identified as a field star through proper motions measurements (   [ sec : mem ] ) .",

    "the 12 x - ray sources that are below the boundary are probably in the foreground or background of the cluster .",
    "it is possible that a few of these sources could be cluster members observed in scattered light , which would make them appear subluminous on a color - magnitude diagram , but none of these objects show any other evidence of youth or membership .",
    "finally , two x - ray sources are detected only in ir data .",

    "@xcite referred to several objects in ic  348 as brown dwarfs or brown dwarf candidates because of the late spectral types implied by the steam measurements of ntc00 .",
    "however , most of these sources have optical spectral types that are earlier that m6 and therefore are probably low - mass stars rather than brown dwarfs (   [ sec : najita ] ) . there are three known members of ic  348 ( 329 , 355 , 613 ) that are likely brown dwarfs ( @xmath58m6 ) and that have been detected in x - rays .",

    "after examining the membership status of all objects toward ic  348 that have been observed spectroscopically in this work and in previous studies , we have arrived at a list of 288 known members of ic  348 , 23 of which are later than m6 and thus are likely to be brown dwarfs .",
    "we find a lower proportion of such late - type members than in the study of ntc00 because of a systematic calibration error in the translation of their photometric data to spectral types , and their identification of a number of faint background stars as low - mass cluster members .",

    "this star could be a member of ic  348 , possibly observed in scattered light , or a field dwarf that is near the opposite side of the cluster .",
