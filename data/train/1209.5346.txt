    "the mechanical exfoliation of graphene,@xcite a one - atom thick sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure , followed by subsequent experiments , @xcite has given rise to a profusion of studies , both experimental and theoretical ( see refs .",
    "for a list of references ) regarding the physical properties of this remarkable material .",
    "such an interest has not subsided to the present date , quite on the contrary .",
    "a simple nearest - neighbor tight - binding approximation of the electronic hamiltonian in graphene reveals that the honeycomb lattice structure leads to a dispersion relation that is linear around two specific points of the brillouin zone , the dirac points .",
    "since the fermi level of pristine graphene lies at these points , its quasi - particles behave , in a continuum approximation , as mass - less relativistic fermions with a speed of light equal to the fermi - velocity ( @xmath0).@xcite    typically , graphene exhibits high crystal quality , large transparency , being highly conductive and very strong yet flexible.@xcite all these characteristics place graphene as a good candidate to be used in a variety of technological applications , such as in solar cell technology,@xcite in liquid crystal devices,@xcite in single molecule sensors,@xcite in the fabrication of nano - sized prototype transistors,@xcite among many others .",
    "understanding the transport properties of graphene is thus an essential research program towards its application to future nanoscopic devices .",
    "several of these sought nanoscopic devices will certainly be based on the use of graphene ribbons and graphene quantum dots .",
    "in particular , graphene ribbons are usually classified as zigzag or armchair , depending on their edge configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gnrs ] ) .",
    "it is already well established that the electronic properties of these nanostructures are strongly affected by their edge configuration .",
    "a nearest - neighbor tight - binding approach leads to the conclusion that zigzag ribbons are metallic regardless of their width , while armchair ribbons can be either semiconducting or metallic , depending on their width .",
    "in addition , zigzag ribbons present edge localized states around the fermi energy.@xcite however , _ ab - initio _ calculations predict that graphene ribbons are always semiconducting.@xcite experimental results show that the ribbons energy gaps increase with decreasing ribbon width.@xcite        it has been shown@xcite that edge disorder modifies substantially the electronic properties of nanostructures based on graphene and is responsible for most of the transport properties in these systems .",
    "the wave - functions associated with zigzag edges and vacancies@xcite decay very slowly with the distance from the edge because of the absence of a gap in the graphene spectrum .",
    "this slow decay leads to strong quantum interference effects that are responsible for destructive quantum interference , anderson localization , and coulomb blockade effects in the electrical conductance of graphene - based devices.@xcite while most of edge disorder in graphene nanostructures is produced by the method of cutting graphene by hot plasma,@xcite it also shows conspicuously in chemically driven methods which can be classified as quasi - equilibrium.@xcite it thus follows that equilibrium mechanisms , such as those described in this work , only place a lower bound on the amount of disorder that can exist in these nanostructures and hence an upper limit in the value of the conductance that can be obtained in these devices .",
    "it is thus of extreme importance for graphene electronics development to understand the effect of edge disorder in the transport properties of graphene ribbons and quantum dots .",
    "one example of disorder appearing at graphene edges are sets of five and seven sided rings of carbon atoms , commonly named in the literature as stone - wales ( sw ) defects.@xcite we emphasize that , for the sake of clarity , from now on , we are going to name these structures as _ stone - wales carbon rings _ , limiting the use of the word _ defects _ to the context of ( thermal ) disorder .",
    "the sw carbon rings have been observed and found to be meta - stable in the bulk of graphene sheets.@xcite moreover , and regarding graphene s high temperature behavior , it was found that the formation of stone - wales carbon rings is the first step in the process of graphene s melting ( @xmath1).@xcite besides , it has been shown through _ ab - initio _ calculations that whenever sw carbon rings are present in non - passivated graphene nanoribbons , the ribbons energy decreases as the carbon ring approaches the edge of the ribbon.@xcite in addition , further _",
    "ab - initio _ calculations have also shown that the formation of sw carbon rings at the edges of both armchair and zigzag nanoribbons , stabilize them , both energetically and mechanically .",
    "@xcite in particular , in the absence of hydrogen passivation , the zigzag edge is only a meta - stable state , the state where the edge is fully reconstructed with sw carbon rings being the ground - state of the system.@xcite moreover , such total reconstruction of the zigzag edge gives rise to the appearance of a new kind of edge state.@xcite however , if the zigzag edges are hydrogen passivated , it is the perfect zigzag edge that has the lower energy .",
    "the reconstruction of the zigzag edge by sw carbon rings acts as a mechanism that self - passivates the edge .",
    "@xcite density functional theory and molecular dynamics calculations corroborate these results , pointing to an energy barrier associated with the edge reconstruction of about @xmath2-@xmath3 per edge unit cell.@xcite    these types of zigzag edge reconstructions ( see fig . [",
    "fig : reczag_family ] ) , are claimed to be stable only at very low hydrogen pressure ( well below ambient conditions ) and very low temperatures.@xcite however , reconstructions of the zigzag ( as well as armchair ) edges have been recently observed with high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( tem),@xcite albeit under rather extreme conditions , namely , the graphene flake is bombarded with high - energy electrons ( @xmath4 ) that remove @xmath5 atoms from the sheet . the recent work of suenaga _",
    "et al._,@xcite on single - atom spectroscopy using low - voltage scanning tem ( stem ) , provides a _ non - destructive _ method of identifying the edge configuration of graphene ribbons , as does the work of warner _",
    "_ on the observation of real - time dynamics of dislocations using high - resolution tem.@xcite moreover , refinements in other techniques , such as raman spectra of the edges,@xcite scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) images of the edges , @xcite or coherent electron focusing@xcite may help in identifying edge reconstructions .    .",
    "( b ) scheme of a totally reconstructed ( with sw carbon rings ) zigzag ribbon , usually named @xmath6 . in ( c ) and ( d ) , we present schemes of a partially reconstructed zigzag ribbon , respectively , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . ]    in this work , we construct a one - dimensional three - color ( or three - state ) potts - like model so as to describe the reconstruction of the zigzag edge with sw carbon rings , due to thermal fluctuations . from such a model , we will extract thermodynamic properties of the zigzag edge , both in the absence and in the presence of hydrogen passivation .",
    "these properties include the number of pentagons and heptagons at an edge , the concentration of domains formed by pentagon - heptagon pairs within larger groups of hexagons or the concentration of domains formed by hexagons within larger groups of pentagon - heptagon pairs ( depending on the state of passivation of the edge ) , and the size - distribution of both kinds of minority domains at the edge .",
    "these quantities are then used to characterize the degree of disorder of the zigzag edge due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the simple model presented in this work indicates that if the nanoribbon edge behaves as a one - dimensional system with short - range interactions , it will present a finite concentration of defects at any finite temperature .",
    "moreover , the average length of such defects is finite at any non - zero temperature .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the case of the one - dimensional ferromagnetic ising model , where domains of minority spins , which can be viewed as the defects perturbing the ground - state configuration , have an average length that diverges at infinitesimally small temperatures , destroying the ferromagnetic order .",
    "we believe that such distinct behavior is due to the lack of a full @xmath9 symmetry in the three - color potts - like model .",
    "furthermore , we are able to compute analytically the distribution of lengths of defective domains ( dsd ) , as well as the concentration of such domains .",
    "we show that the dsd has no fat - tails .    from an experimental point of view",
    ", the concentration of defective domains is the most relevant quantity that one can compute , since it is found to be exponentially dependent on the values of the effective exchange parameters of the model .",
    "hence , the measurement of the concentration of defects would allow for a sensitive determination of these parameters .",
    "since such measurements have not yet been performed , we have estimated these parameters using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "depending on the actual value of the effective parameters , the concentration of defects can become quite large at room temperatures , and may thus have a significant effect on the conductivity of the zigzag ribbon .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section [ sec : pottsmodel ] will be devoted to the presentation of the three - color potts - like model that describes the thermodynamics of the edge with sw carbon rings and of the results extracted from it .",
    "we will first present a descriptive outline of the model . in sub - section [ sec :",
    "edgethermo ] , we will compute the thermodynamic quantities characterizing the edge , using a transfer matrix formulation of the potts - like model and we will analyze their dependence both on the temperature and on the exchange parameters .",
    "finally , in section [ seccon ] , we will present our conclusions .",
    "we leave to the appendices the computation of the exchange parameters from _ ab - initio _ results ( appendix [ sec : exchangeparams ] ) , the calculation of correlation functions in the three - color potts - like model , using the transfer matrix formalism ( appendix [ appa ] ) , and the explicit computation of the size - distribution of domains of polarized and unpolarized spins ( appendix [ app : dsd ] ) .",
    "we will study graphene zigzag edges with sw carbon rings , employing a one - dimensional three - color potts - like model , where each color is assigned to a different polygon of the edge ( hexagons , heptagons and pentagons ) .",
    "we label each edge unit cell , i. e. each polygon at the edge , by the integer variable @xmath10 , with the state of such a cell being described by the ternary variable @xmath11 , according to whether the polygon forming that cell in the reconstructed edge is an hexagon , heptagon or pentagon . we consider a nearest - neighbor coupling between adjacent cells only ( the validity of this assumption will be justified in appendix [ sec : exchangeparamsresults ] ) , which leaves us with @xmath12 possible values for the couplings @xmath13 , depending on the neighboring states .",
    "we take as reference state with zero energy the perfect zigzag edge , thus @xmath14 . taking into account the experimental observations",
    ", we will exclude from the model states where two pentagons or heptagons sit at neighboring sites , i.e. pairings of heptagons or pentagons are forbidden and one has @xmath15 .",
    "invariance under inversion implies that the order in a pentagon - heptagon , pentagon - hexagon or heptagon - hexagon pair is irrelevant , and thus @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , since heptagons and pentagons are created in pairs through the transference of @xmath5 atoms between neighboring sites , we will assume that the probability of creation of a pentagon or an heptagon is the same , which implies that @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the @xmath12 initial possible values of the couplings are reduced to two free parameters : @xmath20 , which reflects the fact that the formation of defects costs energy and @xmath21 , which may be negative or positive depending on whether the totally reconstructed edge has lower or higher energy than the pristine zigzag edge ( i.e. , depending on the state of passivation of the edges , as discussed above ) .",
    "finally , since @xmath5 atoms are conserved , one should , strictly speaking , consider a model with as many heptagons as pentagons , i.e. one should work in a subspace of the state - space having the overall magnetization @xmath22 .",
    "such a constraint can be written in terms of an imaginary applied magnetic field over which one has to integrate , once the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the potts - like model have been computed .",
    "in such a case , the eigenvalues can no longer be simply determined .",
    "we will therefore relax this constraint and we will only implement it on average , as @xmath23 in one - dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "note , moreover , that although some of the edge observation techniques@xcite are highly energetic and cause the ejection of @xmath5 atoms from the edges , the system can not be considered to be in thermodynamic equilibrium when such ejection occurs and the model introduced below is therefore not applicable.@xcite it may however be applicable after a characteristic relaxation time , such that the thermodynamics of the edge would be described in terms of an effective temperature , dependent on the energy deposited by the electron beam and the heat conduction process in graphene .",
    "one would expect the number of ( remaining ) @xmath5 atoms in the edge to be conserved in this late - time regime . in fig .",

    "we now wish to use such a model to compute useful quantities relating to the thermodynamics of the edges .",
    "as is usual in one - dimensional models with nearest neighbor interactions , the speediest way to compute thermodynamic properties , including spin - spin correlation functions , is to express these quantities in terms of a transfer matrix.@xcite in the case of the model presented above , the transfer matrix reads : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the parameters introduced above and computed in appendix [ sec : exchangeparams ] . the model , as defined by eq .",
