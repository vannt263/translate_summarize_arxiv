    "an extensive , coherent stellar structure has revealed itself from behind the obscuring veil of the disk in the direction of the galactic anticenter . first identified as an overdensity of blue stars in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite ( hereafter n02 ) , this structure was subsequently studied by @xcite ( hereafter i03 ) using int wfs photometry , and by @xcite ( hereafter y03 ) using sdss photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter m03 ) found evidence for the structure in their study of m giants selected from 2mass .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter r03 ) also made use of 2mass m giants in a targeted search for evidence of the structure in numerous 4@xmath4 fields in the second and third galactic quadrants .",
    "following y03 , we refer to this galactic anticenter stellar feature as the `` mon '' structure , although future work may prove this to be an inappropriate name ( if a dwarf galaxy , the core does not seem to be in monoceros )",
    ".    between i03 and y03 , evidence for the mon structure has been found in fields spanning @xmath5 and @xmath6 with possible extension to @xmath7 .",
    "n02 estimate the distance of their initial detection at @xmath811 kpc from the sun , with a galactocentric distance of @xmath818 kpc .",
    "i03 determined that the structure s galactocentric distance changes from 18 kpc at @xmath9 to 14 kpc at @xmath10 .",
    "r03 have been able to trace the structure clearly over @xmath11 using 2mass m giants , with less obvious , but still strong evidence for coherence over @xmath12 , and distances consistent with those previously reported .",
    "scaleheights for the structure have been estimated at @xmath13 kpc , @xmath14 kpc , and @xmath15 kpc , but variable with galactic longitude ( y03 , i03 and r03 , respectively ) .",
    "the radial thickness has been estimated to be @xmath16 kpc ( y03 ) and @xmath17 kpc ( i03 ) .    based on velocities from both targeted and serendipitously collected sdss spectra , and on the assumption of a circular orbit , y03 report a @xmath18 km s@xmath2 prograde rotation for the mon system , and velocity dispersions too narrow ( 2230 km s@xmath2 ) to be identified with any known galactic component .",
    "they estimate a preliminary metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath19 for their blue stars , based on main sequence turnoff colors and ( k ) line strengths from spectra with @xmath20 at @xmath21 .    despite this flurry of study over the last year",
    ", the nature of the mon structure remains unsettled .",
    "i03 suggest a number of scenarios including a tidally disrupted satellite galaxy , an outer spiral arm , or even a resonance induced by an asymmetric galactic component .",
    "however , i03 hold slight preference for the interpretation that the mon structure is a perturbation of the galactic disk resulting from old , repeated warpings due to the influence of the magellanic clouds and/or the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf .",
    "y03 prefer the interpretation that the structure is a tidally disrupted satellite . @xcite",
    "have examined numerical simulations of tidally disrupted satellite galaxies in roughly coplanar orbits with disk galaxies . although not specifically targeted to explain the mon structure , these simulations provide interesting insight into the structure of tidally disrupted objects at different evolutionary epochs .",
    "specifically , young tidal arcs are azimuthally limited and exhibit a strong radial velocity gradient , while older tidal arcs mix to form shells that show no azimuthal velocity trend .    in this work , the nature of the mon structure is explored spectroscopically over a wide area .",
    "targets were selected based on the detection of the mon structure in m03 s work to trace the tidal tails of the sgr dwarf galaxy . in their figure 10 , the mon structure is apparent as an asymmetric concentration of stars near the galactic plane at @xmath22 in the sgr plane coordinate system . at the longitudes probed by that figure",
    ", it is apparent that the mon structure is more concentrated to the northern galactic hemisphere , an observation noted by previous authors and also suggested by the distribution of 2mass stars shown in figure  [ xyzplot ] .",
    "the sample consists of m giants selected using the two - color discrimination technique described in m03 .",
    "stars in significantly reddened directions ( @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 ) were excluded to minimize photometric parallax errors .",
    "in addition , we imposed the restrictions @xmath25 and @xmath26 kpc ( with distances estimated from the sgr core absolute magnitude - color relation from m03 ) .",
    "the former criterion removes low - metallicity milky way giants ( and yields the brightest targets ) , and the latter removes the bulk of the disk stars and focuses on galactocentric radii reported to be occupied by the mon structure .",
    "selection of stars in the noted concentration around @xmath22 in m03 s figure 10 practically limits the sample s galactic longitude range since that plot represents only a 14 kpc thick slice through the mon feature .",
    "the distribution of targets is shown in figure  [ xyzplot ] .",
    "we concentrate primarily on the northern galactic hemisphere , where the largest overdensity appears in the smoothed 2mass m giant distribution .",
    "the sample s radial coverage is larger in the direction toward @xmath27 , where r03 also note increased structure depth .",
    "data were collected ut 2003 april 1725 using the goldcam spectrograph on the 2.1-meter telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the spectra cover @xmath28   with instrumental @xmath29 .",
    "following overscan correction , trimming , and bias subtraction , the data were flatfielded using quartz lamp exposures that had been spectrally normalized to remove the large - scale spectral response .",
    "this latter step adequately removed fringing .",
    "spectra were extracted and wavelength - calibrated using comparison lamp spectra taken at the same telescope position as the targets .    using our own software , radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating the fourier - filtered spectra against a variety of different standards of late spectral type .",
    "average velocity uncertainties of @xmath30 km s@xmath2 were achieved for target spectra with mean peak @xmath31 correlated against 26 standard star observations .",
    "the mon m giant sample shows ( figure  [ vgsr ] ) a positive velocity gradient with decreasing galactic longitude , consistent with prograde rotation . while this agrees qualitatively with the results of y03 , at similar longitudes the m giant radial velocities are systematically lower by @xmath32 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we have found ( s. r. majewski et al .",
    ", in preparation ) a similar offset with y03 observations of the sgr tidal tails ; this problem is discussed further in that reference . a third - order polynomial fit to the velocity trend shows that the locus passes through @xmath33 km s@xmath2 at @xmath34 , which indicates a slightly non - circular orbit .",
    "the velocity locus passes through @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "the present latitude coverage is less uniform ( reflecting only our target selection ) , but is consistent with no velocity gradient in that dimension .    of the main galactic components , the thick disk should be the dominant contributor of m giants in the regions represented by most of our stars , with the thin disk contributing significantly less and the halo contributing negligibly @xcite . using @xmath37 and @xmath38 km s@xmath2 for the thin and thick disks @xcite , we estimate the expected line - of - sight velocity dispersions for these components at @xmath39 kpc toward @xmath40 to be @xmath840 and",
    "@xmath864 km s@xmath2 , respectively . in contrast , a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath41 km s@xmath2 for 53 stars in the mon structure was determined about the polynomial fit after using a @xmath42 rejection threshold that removed 5 stars .",
    "this is substantially smaller than expectation for the galactic components .",
    "it is interesting to note that structure @xcite in the 21-cm emission near the galactic anticenter has previously been suggested @xcite to imply the presence of a tidally disrupted satellite galaxy , although subsequent work @xcite did not favor this interpretation .",
    "a connection to the mon  milky way interaction is suggested by the similar spatial distributions , but the shifted velocity trend ( figure  [ vgsr ] ) implies that establishing this will require consideration of more complicated interactions with the milky way s gaseous disk .",
    "as r03 point out , the mere presence of m giants in the mon structure provides circumstantial evidence for a relatively metal - rich component .",
    "we attempted to estimate the metallicities of our sample stars using the index cat * defined by @xcite .",
    "however , their cat * fitting functions @xcite are not metallicity sensitive for stars in the temperature range of our sample . attempts to apply the principal component analysis technique of @xcite met with similarly ambiguous results since",
    "that work was not calibrated to sufficently late spectral types . in the end",
    ", a much - simplified method was adopted to estimate the metallicities of a representative subsample of stars . a direct summation of @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 ) indices @xcite was calculated for a set of bright , red calibrator stars .",
    "a linear fit was then derived between the combined indices of these stars and their published metallicities ( figure  [ metal ] ) .",
    "calibrators were restricted to @xmath45 , log@xmath46 , and @xmath47 [ fe / h ] @xmath48 . applying the linear fit for these data to mon stars in the same color range and with @xmath49 yields @xmath50[fe",
    "/ h]@xmath51 . as a relative reference ,",
    "the metallicity determined for a larger number of sgr m giants observed during the same run is found to be [ fe / h ] @xmath52 , slightly more metal - rich ( but still within the uncertainty ) than the [ fe / h ] @xmath53 reported by @xcite for the most recent episode of sgr star formation .",
    "regardless of absolute calibration uncertainties , the mon m giants appear to be of comparable , but slightly lower metallicity than sgr m giants .",
    "we favor the interpretation that the mon structure is a satellite galaxy currently undergoing tidal disruption and similar to the sgr system for the following reasons :    \\(1 ) the velocity trend with longitude indicates that the structure is in a non - circular orbit , but with low eccentricity .",
    "@xcite find a preference for higher eccentricities in distributions of satellites born in a spherical potential , and recent theoretical work @xcite , indicates that circularization of these orbits by dynamical friction is probably insignificant .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrate how sensitively the tidal disruption of satellites depends on their orbital eccentricity , so that those currently remaining intact or undergoing disruption now should also be those originally born on near - circular orbits .",
    "thus , while i03 believe the near - circular orbit casts doubt on the disrupted satellite scenario , it does not rule it out .",
    "indeed , increased circularity might be expected for objects accreted at later epochs .",
    "\\(2 ) we estimate the velocity dispersion of our sample to be @xmath1 km s@xmath2 , notably lower than y03 s 27 , 22 , 30 , and 30 km s@xmath2 for their four fields . nevertheless , in all cases the dispersion is lower than would be expected of any known galactic component .",
    "\\(3 ) we estimate [ fe / h ] @xmath54 for our sample , showing the existence of a relatively enriched population . considering the [ fe / h ] @xmath19 reported by y03",
    ", a spread in metallicity is implied , and suggestive of multiple epochs of star formation , as seen in the sgr dwarf @xcite .",
    "while our estimate is also consistent with the disk metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath55 at @xmath56 kpc ) expected from extrapolation of the open cluster metallicity gradient @xcite , much of our sample is so high above the galactic plane that we find it difficult to understand how all of the m giants could be associated with the disk , unless a very large warp is invoked .",
    "the galactic warp @xcite is not large enough , nor is it in the same orientation , to explain our sample as a disk feature unless the stars in the warp do not trace the gas .",
    "i03 suggest that a tidal stream should fill the radial space between perigalacticon and apogalacticon after a sufficiently long period of time .",
    "@xcite note that tidal arcs become tenuous and difficult to recognize relatively quickly after their first pericentric passage ; older ring - like features eventually form shells around the central galaxy and therefore would show no velocity trend with azimuthal angle .",
    "thus , the velocity coherence , velocity trend with longitude , thin radial thickness ( estimated by y03 and i03 ) , and separation from the edge of the disk ( figure 4 in r03 ) supports not only the hypothesis that the mon structure is a tidal stream , but also one that is relatively dynamically young .",
    "\\(4 ) at least four globular clusters are noted ( figure  [ vgsr ] ) that may be associated with the stream based on _ both _ position and kinematical data @xcite .",
    "this string - like orientation of low latitude clusters is unusual in the outer milky way galactic cluster system , but resembles the correlation of clusters to the tidal arms of the sgr system @xcite .",
    "the correlated cluster metallicities exhibit a spread that is also similar to that of the sgr clusters  [ fe / h ]  @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for , , , and , respectively .",
    "we note an additional cluster , , that is suitably placed in position , but for which no velocity or metallicity information is currently available .",
    "if these clusters are genuinely associated with the mon structure , then we would conclude with even greater certainty that it is in fact a sagittarius - like dwarf galaxy undergoing tidal disruption by the milky way .",
    "we thank butler burton for an insightful correspondence , and matt garvin , kathryn johnston , megan kohring , christopher palma , and michael siegel for software that aided our analyses .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation ."
