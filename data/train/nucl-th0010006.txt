    "some unexpected features observed in the dependence of these cross sections on the mass ( @xmath11 ) and charge ( @xmath12 ) numbers have been very recently explained by us @xcite as arising from saturation of the @xmath0 annihilation cross sections due to the strong absorption that is characteristic of the @xmath0-nucleus interaction . using an optical model approach we have shown that the @xmath1 borderline between @xmath0 atoms and the scattering regime can be crossed using the same @xmath0-nucleus potential , i.e. one can get good fits to experimental results both for @xmath0 atoms and for low energy annihilation cross sections with the same potential , at least within a given mass region of the periodic table .",
    "such potentials are strongly absorptive , which leads to a remarkable saturation of the total reaction cross section with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "strong absorption has very recently been shown @xcite to lead also to saturation of the widths of @xmath0 atomic states and to the prediction of relatively narrow deeply bound @xmath0 atomic states .",
    "the close analogy between bound - state widths and total reaction cross sections is best demonstrated by observing the corresponding expressions , assuming for simplicity a schrdinger - type equation . the width @xmath19 of an atomic level",
    "is then given in terms of the optical potential @xmath20 by :    @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the @xmath0 full atomic wavefunction .",

    "we note that these expressions involve no approximation .    in the present work",
    "we extend the earlier work by presenting a full analysis of the dependence of calculated annihilation cross sections on @xmath11 , on @xmath12 and on the energy up to 16 mev ( @xmath25 mev ) . beginning with the @xmath3 system",

    "this was repeated for several values of @xmath85 between 1 and 2 fm . in all cases excellent fits to the annihilation cross sections",
    "were achieved , and consequently the range parameter @xmath85 could not be determined uniquely from the annihilation cross sections . as we aim at using the same potential on both sides of the @xmath1 borderline , we turned next to the @xmath0h atom . using the same type of potential as above , excellent agreement between calculation and experiment @xcite",
    "was achieved by varying @xmath32 for any value of @xmath85 between 1 and 2 fm . however , requiring that both atomic and scattering data be described by the same potential @xmath4 , we find @xmath85=1.5 fm and @xmath86 fm , leading to a combined @xmath87 of 3.8 for the 6 data points for annihilation cross sections plus the 3 data points for the atom .",

    "this potential will be referred to as potential ( g ) . a more elaborate potential",
    "was previously shown @xcite to be able to fit the low - energy @xmath3 annihilation data . in that potential",
    "the real part is described by a saxon - woods ( sw ) shape with a radius of 1.89 fm and diffuseness parameter of 0.2 fm whereas the imaginary part has the sw shape with a radius of only 0.41 fm and the same diffuseness of 0.2 fm . adopting these geometries we repeated the procedure described above for fitting the annihilation and atomic data and obtained very good fits with a @xmath87 of 5.8 for the 9 data points .",
    "the parameter @xmath90 is @xmath91 fm , with about @xmath9210% uncertainties , leading to potential depths of 46.5 and 7550 mev for the real and imaginary parts , respectively , in very good agreement with refs .",
    "this potential will be referred to as potential ( sw ) .",
    "we note that for both potentials ( g ) and ( sw ) , the imaginary part is considerably stronger than the real part , which signals a very strong absorptivity in the @xmath3 system .",
    "the real part of the potential , under such circumstances , plays only a minor role @xcite .",
    "the imaginary parts of the potentials ( g ) and ( sw ) have markedly different ranges . the very short range of ( sw ) is qualitatively in agreement with other widely used phenomenological potentials @xcite , whereas the range of ( g ) is about twice as large as for these potentials .",
    "figure [ fig : h ] shows results for the @xmath3 system .",
    "the upper part compares calculated reaction cross sections for the two potentials with the experimental values , and the excellent agreement is evident .",
    "the lower part shows the ratios of real to imaginary parts of the forward coulomb - modified scattering amplitude @xmath93 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ampl1 ] ) - ( [ eq : opers ] ) ] for the two potentials , which is a quantity of considerable interest : this , so called @xmath5 parameter , was determined at higher @xmath0 incident momenta to be positive , tending to zero between 200 - 300 mev / c @xcite .",
    "our calculations give negative values for @xmath5 at this lower - momentum range , indicating a smooth transition to the corresponding ratios for the coulomb - modified scattering length also shown in the lower part , at zero energy , for potentials ( g ) and ( sw ) .",
    "evidently the two potentials , in spite of their different geometry , are very similar in predicting observable quantities .",
    "with an established @xmath3 interaction potential @xmath4 , the simplest way of incorporating this potential into heavier @xmath0-nuclear systems would be to fold it with the nuclear density to obtain a @xmath0-nucleus potential : @xmath94 .",
    "setting aside possible renormalization effects in nuclei , this folding procedure also tacitly assumes that at low energy the spin - averaged @xmath95 interaction is approximately equal to the spin - averaged @xmath3 interaction , as supported by the near equality of the imaginary parts of the corresponding scattering lengths @xcite and also by several phenomenological @xmath96 potentials @xcite .",
    "however , recent @xmath97 low - energy annihilation data from the obelix collaboration @xcite suggest that the @xmath97 interaction , which by charge symmetry is equal to the @xmath95 interaction , is considerably weaker than the @xmath3 interaction . therefore , we keep the strength of the density - folded @xmath0-nucleus potential as a free parameter in our search , as is discussed below .    in the energy range covered by the present work",
    "the majority of data come from @xmath0 atoms and therefore this naive approach is best tested by applying the resulting potentials to @xmath0 atoms .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath0 - nucleus potentials obtained from @xmath0 atoms are not unique . for `",
    "macroscopic ' nuclear densities of the type discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for @xmath98 , a gaussian with a range parameter of about 1.5 fm leads to the best fit .",
    "folding in the @xmath99 ( g ) potential with ` macroscopic ' nuclear densities , we find that a _ density - folded _ optical potential of the form ( [ eq : potl ] ) , with @xmath100 fm , fits all @xmath0 atoms heavier than boron ( @xmath98 ) with a @xmath87 of 2.4 per point , whilst the corresponding value for a best - fit phenomenological potential of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : potl ] ) using the same unfolded nuclear densities is 2.7 @xcite .",

    "the value of its strength parameter @xmath32 is 2/3 of the strength @xmath90 of the @xmath3 potential ( g ) .",
    "note that this is not a best - fit potential but merely a renormalized g @xmath101 @xmath102 potential , where a common factor is applied to the real and imaginary parts . turning to @xmath103 , accurate experimental annihilation cross sections at low energies are scarce in this mass range , and we only note that the calculated cross sections for ne are in reasonably good agreement with the data @xcite , as can be seen from table [ tab : ne ] .",
    "having gained confidence in the applicability of the density - folded optical potential ( f ) for nuclei , we use it to calculate @xmath0 reaction cross sections over the periodic table for a range of energies , in order to study the systematics of the dependence on @xmath12 , on @xmath11 and on the energy .",
    "figure [ fig : heavy ] shows , in the upper part , the calculated reaction cross sections for @xmath0 on ne , ca , zr , sn and pb at 37.6 , 57 and 106.6 mev / c .",
    "it is seen that the range of values is very broad ; for a given energy the calculated cross sections vary by a factor of between 6 and 10 . for a given nucleus",
    "the cross sections vary with energy by a factor between 3.2 and 5.7 .",
    "the mechanisms causing these variations are obviously of interest .    for strongly absorbed particles such as low energy antiprotons , disregarding the coulomb potential ,",
    "the total reaction cross section may be approximated by @xmath104 where @xmath82 is the radius of the nucleus .",
    "the underlying assumption is that antiprotons with impact parameter less than @xmath82 , or equivalently with orbital angular momentum up to @xmath105 where semiclassically @xmath106 , are totally absorbed .",
    "however , due to the focussing effect of the attractive coulomb potential , particles with impact parameters larger than @xmath82 also interact with the nucleus , thus causing the cross section to increase .",
    "the low energy coulomb problem is well described by the semiclassical approach @xcite as recognized a long time ago by blair in connection with @xmath107 particle reactions on nuclei @xcite . assuming that total absorption occurs in all partial waves for which the distance of closest approach is smaller than @xmath82 , one gets the following relation between the coulomb - modified @xmath105 and @xmath82 :    @xmath108    at very low energies , @xmath109 , and therefore @xmath110 due to the focussing effect of @xmath37 .",
    "the total reaction cross section in the strong absorption limit is then given by    @xmath111    where @xmath112 and @xmath40 are the laboratory and c.m .",
    "wave numbers , respectively .",
    "the second term within the brackets represents the coulomb focusing effect and at very low energies it becomes dominant @xcite , thus leading to an @xmath113 dependence of the cross section if @xmath114 . at high energies the usual strong absorption value @xmath104 is obtained . in order to use this expression",
    "one needs to define an equivalent radius @xmath82 that will properly represent the @xmath0-nucleus interaction at the particular energy .",
    "we proceed to define such a radius .",
    "expanding the @xmath0-nucleus scattering wave function in partial waves , @xmath115 we define an average radius @xmath116 for the @xmath117 partial wave @xmath118 with @xmath119im @xmath120 .",
    "then , bearing in mind the partial - wave expansion of the reaction cross section eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmar2 ] ) , we define an average radius as follows : @xmath121 expanding alternatively the reaction cross section eq .",
    "( [ equ : sigma ] ) in partial waves : @xmath122 one finds that @xmath123 which combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ravg1 ] ) leads to an equivalent expression for @xmath124 : @xmath125 note that the average radius turns out to be slightly energy dependent . at @xmath126 = 37.6 mev / c , the lowest @xmath0 incident momentum for",
    "which @xmath3 annihilation has been measured @xcite , the calculated values of @xmath124 appropriate to the density - folded optical potential ( f ) can be parameterized to better than 1% by @xmath127 in fact , this expression holds to better than 2% for the whole range of very low energies up to @xmath128 mev / c .    in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : heavy ] are plotted the ratios of the calculated cross sections to the semiclassical expression ( [ eq : sigma ] ) where for @xmath82 we took either the radius of a rigid sphere having the same average radius as the optical potential ( f ) , namely @xmath129 , or just @xmath130 which could be more appropriate due to the substantial attenuation of the wavefunction which is involved in the definition of @xmath124 .",
    "it is seen that these ratios vary remarkably little , by less than 5% for the lower band , when the cross sections vary by factors between 3 and 10 . at the lower energy",
    "the coulomb focusing is dominant but at the higher energies covered here both terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) are important .",
    "it may therefore be concluded that the dependence of the calculated reaction cross sections on the three parameters ( @xmath131 and energy ) is almost exclusively given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "another consequence of the strongly absorptive @xmath0-nucleus optical potential is the saturation of the physical observables which are induced by the absorptivity .",
    "thus , for @xmath15 , widths of @xmath0 atomic levels saturate as function of the magnitude of i m @xmath20 @xcite and , for @xmath16 , total reaction cross sections also saturate with it @xcite .",
    "as argued in our earlier work @xcite , the saturation property of @xmath63 for any given nucleus also implies that @xmath63 does not rise with @xmath12 and @xmath11 as fast as it would have risen if the @xmath0 absorption were considerably weaker and therefore could be treated perturbatively .",
    "this is demonstrated here differently , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sat ] , where the saturation factor @xmath132 defined as @xmath133 is plotted at @xmath134 mev / c ( 1.73 mev ) as function of @xmath11 , using the density - folded optical potential ( f ) for @xmath10 , ( f ) for @xmath27he ( see below in sect . [",
    "sec : he ] ) and ( g ) for h. for i m @xmath32 as small as @xmath135 of its nominal value ( of 1.2 fm for potential ( f ) ) , the calculated @xmath136 is very nearly linear in i m @xmath32 .",
    "if the linear rise of @xmath136 were sustained up to the nominal value , the saturation factor @xmath132 would have assumed the value @xmath137 .",
    "however , for i m @xmath32 = 1.2 fm for potential ( f ) , the calculation is strongly nonperturbative , as witnessed in the figure by the small values of @xmath132 relative to 1 , about 0.1 and less beginning with ne .",
    "the saturation of @xmath136 has two aspects to it : ( i ) that @xmath132 depends very weakly on i m @xmath32 in the nonperturbative regime ( not shown in the figure ) ; and ( ii ) that @xmath132 monotonically decreases with @xmath11 , as is shown in the figure , both for antiprotons ( solid curve ) and for antineutrons ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the values of @xmath132 for antiprotons are lower than for antineutrons due to the coulomb focussing effect which for antiprotons acts in two seemingly opposing ways : ( i ) enhancing the reaction cross section in the negatively charged case compared to the uncharged case , but also ( ii ) expelling more effectively @xcite the @xmath0 wavefunction from the nuclear region , so that @xmath136 becomes more strongly suppressed than for antineutrons .",
    "this latter effect gets weaker with increasing energy ; at @xmath138 mev , @xmath139 is larger by 20 - 25 % than at 1.73 mev , whereas @xmath140 is smaller than at 1.73 mev .",
    "in this section we study the @xmath0 - @xmath141he system at very low energies , within the optical model approach , in order to test the scattering - length approximation ( sla ) which was successfully applied to the @xmath3 system @xcite and has recently been extended to the @xmath142 and @xmath0 - @xmath27he systems @xcite .",
    "@xmath27he is one of the very few nuclei for which data on the strong interaction of @xmath0 are available for both the very low energy scattering regime and the atomic negative energy regime .",
    "there are two data points for the total annihilation cross section below 3 mev in the positive energy regime @xcite , and three data points for the atomic @xmath8 level shift and width plus the width of the @xmath143 level @xcite above @xmath14420 kev in the negative energy regime .",
    "we chose to test the ability of the optical model to reproduce these data together with the corresponding set of atomic shift and widths data for @xmath145he @xcite , although the optical model approach is not very well suited for studying such light nuclear targets .",
    "since potential ( f ) does not reproduce very well the @xmath0-nuclear observables for @xmath146 , we searched over its parameters to fit the @xmath0 -@xmath141he data mentioned above . as was already encountered in the fitting procedure described in our earlier work @xcite for potential ( a ) of that reference , when trying to fit the atomic @xmath8 and @xmath143 levels simultaneously the calculated width of the @xmath8 state in @xmath27he came out too small .",
    "this has been noted by other researchers before , as summarized in ref .",
    "we therefore dropped out the @xmath143 widths data from the fitting procedure , partly on the grounds that the @xmath147-wave contribution to the very low energy @xmath0 annihilation cross sections , which are also being explored here , is almost negligible compared to the dominant @xmath26 and @xmath148 waves ( see below ) .",
    "the resulting density - folded optical potential , referred to as ( f ) , has the following parameters : @xmath149 fm for the range parameter of the two - body gaussian interaction folded in with the he densities , and a strength parameter @xmath150 fm in the notation of eq .",

    "clearly , potential ( f ) describes well these data .",
