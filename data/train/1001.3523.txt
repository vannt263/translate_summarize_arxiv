    "the joint discussion dedicated to the study of diffuse light in clusters took place on the 6and 7of august , 2009 during the _ xxviith _ iau general assembly in rio de janeiro .",
    "it was the first scientific meeting on this subject .",
    "this joint discussion provided a forum to confront observational evidence and theoretical predictions , and to identify future directions for understanding the origin and implications of this new component of galaxy clusters .",
    "the joint discussion included four main sessions covering the distribution of diffuse light in clusters and groups , the kinematics of intracluster stars , the intracluster stellar populations , and the predictions of cosmological simulations for the evolution of galaxies in clusters and groups , and for the formation of the intracluster light .",
    "14 invited plus 10 oral talks , and 14 poster papers contributed to an intense scientific exchange and set the stage for a lively scientific discussion , which concluded the workshop .    in",
    "what follows , we provide a brief summary and some selected references for the talks in the four sessions , and end with a summary of the discussion which took place on august 7 , 2009 .",
    "thanks to the specially adapted burrel schmidt telescope , the study of intracluster light in the virgo cluster reached for the first time a photometric accuracy of significantly less than @xmath1% of night sky emission over an area of many square degrees .",
    "deep v ( @xmath2 mag / arcsec@xmath3 ) and b band ( @xmath4 mag / arcsec@xmath3 ) photometry with calibrated , quantitative photometric solutions and a well understood error model were obtained .",
    "this work has revealed faint surface brightness features over a multitude of angular scales , from narrow streams to extended diffuse halos .",
    "the b - v colour of the icl is similar to that in the outer halos of ellipticals , except for some streamers , and there is a rough correlation with the spatial distribution of intracluster planetary nebulae .",

    "photographic photometry in the 1970s revealed a large elongated diffuse component in the core of the cluster , around the two bcg galaxies .",
    "several small - scale streamers and plumes were discovered in the 1990s with ccd photometry .",
    "the cfht multi - color coma survey shows that the diffuse light is found either in the centre of the coma cluster or along the in - fall directions towards nearby large scale structures .",

    "compact groups are high density regions in the universe where the morphology of both the stars and the hi gas in galaxies is often disturbed , providing evidence for on - going interactions .",
    "an evolutionary sequence for compact groups can be traced by the fraction of light in the diffuse component on the group scale , the intragroup light ( igl ) , which increases with the degree of interactions , reaching up to 30 - 40% in groups with many ongoing interactions .",
    "groups with the highest fraction of igl light are also those with the highest fraction of early type galaxies .",
    "the colour of the igl in most cases is similar to the colours in the outskirts of the member galaxies .",

    "<S> recent studies show that the icl contains of the order of 10% and perhaps up to 30% of the stellar mass in the cluster , but in the cores of some dense and rich clusters like coma , the local icl fraction can be high as 40%-50% . </S>",

    "<S> how and when did the icl form ? what is the connection to the central brightest cluster galaxy ? </S>",
    "<S> cosmological n - body and hydrodynamical simulations are beginning to make predictions for the kinematics and origin of the icl . </S>",
    "<S> the icl traces the evolution of baryonic substructures in dense environments and can thus be used to constrain some aspects of cosmological simulations that are most uncertain , such as the modeling of star formation and the mass distribution of the baryonic component in galaxies . </S>"
