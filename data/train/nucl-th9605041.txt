    "at low energies it seems to be possible to describe hadronic processes in terms of nucleons and mesons alone .",
    "effective dynamical models for the @xmath4 interaction can be constructed with these underlying degrees of freedom .",
    "meson exchange models are then favored since they allow a straightforward consistent connection to the electromagnetic and electroweak reactions .",
    "however , to extend these models up to a few gev lab energy , as needed for the study of many reactions produced at cebaf and other modern accelerators , one must include many inelastic channels associated with the explicit production of pions ( and other mesons ) .",
    "these channels are often described by baryon isobars , including their decays and propagation .    at these higher energies",
    ", one must also include relativistic effects which arise not only from the kinematics and the need to correctly transform amplitudes from one frame to another , but also from the nonlocallity and energy dependence which characterize relativistic interactions obtained from an effective field theory .",
    "the correct treatment of unitarity also requires that the the renormalization of the meson - nucleon vertices and the simultaneous dressing of the `` bare '' nucleons by meson rescattering be consistent with the meson exchange picture of the nuclear force@xcite .",
    "it is difficult to deal consistently with this complex problem within strictly non - relativistic formalisms@xcite , and we will show in this paper that a relativistic effective field theory provides a natural way to attack this problem .    using the covariant spectator ( or gross ) equations@xcite ,",
    "relativistic one boson exchange ( obe ) models have been found which give an excellent description of elastic @xmath4 scattering ( ie .",
    "below the pion production threshold)@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to outline how this program should be extended to include the inelastic effects arising from the explicit production of pions in intermediate states .",
    "we will limit ourselves to consideration of the lowest lying inelastic cut arising from the @xmath5 channel , and postpone any discussion of how to treat the @xmath6 channels ( with @xmath7 ) .    consider a simple model with a nucleon ( @xmath8 ) and its first excited state ( @xmath9 ) coupled to a pion .",
    "assume that the two baryons @xmath8 and @xmath9 are both bound states of some other fundamental constituents confined inside the baryon volume , so that in the absence of the interaction with the pion they are both stable states .",
    "the coupling to the pion then dresses the @xmath8 and , if we assume @xmath10 , allows the @xmath9 to decay to @xmath11 . to treat the @xmath5 cuts consistently in a _ time - ordered formalism _ , it is then sufficient to ignore diagrams which contribute to @xmath12 cuts , such as those with @xmath13 and @xmath14 channels .",
    "examples of classes of diagrams which must be included and classes which can be ignored are shown in fig .  1 . the diagrams in figs .",
    "1a are iterations of bare @xmath8 and @xmath9 states , the @xmath14 channel being excluded because its cuts are too high .",
    "diagrams in figs .",
    "1b are generated from those in 1a through the consistent application of unitarity .",
    "they include nucleon dressing , the virtual transition of @xmath15 ( when not forbidden by selection rules ) , and the transitions @xmath16 , which give the @xmath9 its width in this model .",
    "diagrams in figs .",
    "1c all have higher cuts and are ignored in this approximation .",
    "note that this eliminates the need to consider the @xmath17 vertex and the @xmath18 dressing of the baryons .",
    "the time ordered formalism is not covariant , and it is desirable to find diagrams from covariant perturbation theory which include the physics contained in figs .",
    "1a and b. motivated by the advantages of the gross or `` spectator '' prescription for dealing with the relative energy variable in four - dimensional integral equations @xcite , we chose the class of diagrams shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in these figures the `` x '' means that the nucleon is on - shell ; which means that its propagator is replaced by @xmath19 restricting the spectator nucleons in @xmath20 and @xmath21 loops to their mass - shell does not alter the @xmath5 unitarity cuts contained in these diagrams .",
    "this choice is also consistent with our aim to relate the present work to the one of ref .",

    "@xcite a non - relativistic equation is used , in ref .",

    "@xcite the blankbecler and sugar reduction is used .",
    "each of these approaches would suggest a particular way of handling the diagrams in fig .  1 .",
    "since the gross equation specifies that one particle is on the mass - shell in any intermediate state , the covariant class of diagrams shown in fig .  2 , with the substitution of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , is the correct way to incorporate the physics of fig .  1 into that formalism .",
    "our discussion implies that the full treatment of the coupled @xmath22 system requires the summation of the class of diagrams shown , up to 6th order , in fig .",
    "a general discussion of the coupled equations which sum this infinite class of diagrams will be presented elsewhere . here",
    "we will limit ourselves to an evaluation of the kernel shown in fig .",
    "when this kernel is added to the obe kernel used in the relativistic treatment of the @xmath4 channel below the pion production threshold @xcite , we have an equation which sums the subclass of diagrams shown in fig .",

    "this diagram is evaluated by carrying out the three - dimensional numerical integration over the internal three - momentum because the spectator prescription of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) specifies the internal energy .",
    "furthermore , since the iteration of the one pion exchange ( ope ) graphs with bare @xmath4 intermediate states are already included when the @xmath4 scattering is described using the obe kernel , the contribution from the undressed direct nucleon pole ( with bare dirac nucleon propagator describing the intermediate nucleon ) must be subtracted from the @xmath0 amplitude which is used in fig .  4 in order to avoid double counting .",
    "the dressing of the nucleon pole term which arises from @xmath0 rescattering must be retained . in a short - hand symbolic notation , the kernel obtained from fig .",

    "2b1 . in this diagram ,",
    "one of the nucleons is off - shell and is being dressed by the @xmath0 interaction while the other is a physical on - shell nucleon .",
    "how can these two nucleons be considered identical when they are treated in such a different way ?",
    "this question has a very simple answer in the spectator formalism .",
    "first , we must symmetrize the interaction , and this is the reason why both diagrams shown in fig .  4 must be included in the kernel .",
    "if , in addition , we require that the _ properties of a dressed nucleon be identical to a free nucleon when it is on mass - shell _ , then the two nucleons will be identical in every respect .",
    "the model we will use to describe the @xmath0 scattering part@xcite of the tpe kernel has precisely this feature .",
    "as discussed above , we limit ourselves in this work to a calculation of the tpe potential given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and shown diagramatically in fig .  4 ,",
    "in which the full @xmath0 amplitude ( with the _ direct nucleon pole term removed _ ) is embedded in the two - nucleon system . as we have emphasized above",
    ", it is essential to remove the direct nucleon pole term from the @xmath0 scattering amplitude ( so the `` blob '' in fig .",
    "4 represents this difference ) in order to avoid counting the nucleon box contribution more than once .    according to the conventional wisdom underlying the one boson exchange model , the process of fig .",
    "4 contributes to the intermediate and short range behavior of the @xmath4 interaction , and is represented by the exchange of effective bosons with masses heavier than two pion masses ( ie .",
    "greater than @xmath27 mev ) .",
    "such a representation can not be valid above the @xmath5 threshold , however , where production of a physical @xmath5 intermediate state ensures that the @xmath4 scattering will be inelastic@xcite .",
    "our calculation will be applied below the pion production threshold , and is only meant to be a first step to estimating the contributions from nucleon resonances and to preparing the way for the extension of the models of ref .",
    "@xcite to higher energies",
    ". we will conclude from the results that the diagram of fig .",
    "4 gives a good explanation of the appearance of effective @xmath28 and @xmath29 mesons , which describe the tpe exchange but do not correspond to real mesons .",
    "the calculation of the diagram shown in fig .  4 is greatly simplified if we use a @xmath0 amplitude with a simple , manifestly covariant sructure .",
    "we take here the covariant @xmath0 amplitude already constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied successfully ( with minor changes ) to the description of pion photoproduction @xcite and to the calculation of the @xmath1 isobar @xmath30 ratio .",
    "the covariant @xmath0 amplitude is decomposed into contributions even and odd under the exchange of isospin @xmath31\\ ] ] where each component depends only on the total four - momentum of the @xmath32 system , which we denote by @xmath33 , @xmath34 we use the latest version of the model given in ref .",
    "details can be found both in both @xcite and @xcite , where a description of the phase shifts and inelasticities is also given .",
    "this calculation of the effective tpe potential differs substantially from previous work .",
    "most other calculations have limited contributions to the @xmath0 amplitude which appears in fig .  4 to the @xmath1 isobar @xcite .",
    "some have used dispersion relations to include other resonances @xcite .",
    "our calculation includes the following features    * the @xmath0 amplitude is obtained beyond the tree - level , by solving a relativistic two - body scattering integral equation where the pion is considered on its mass - shell in all the intermediate states ; * the kernel of the @xmath0 equation includes the nucleon , @xmath1 , roper and @xmath2 poles together with a contact term which includes effects from the crossed nucleon pole and @xmath28 and @xmath35 exchange terms , essential to satisfy chiral symmetry constraints and include the physics of the inelastic @xmath5 channel approximately ; * the spin @xmath36 particles ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) are described by a propagator that includes a covariant spin @xmath36 projection operator with the pole at @xmath37 cancelled by a zero in the baryon form factor ; * the baryon form factors vanish not only at at @xmath37 , but also in the space - like region @xmath38 ( which lies far away from the physical scattering region ) .    since the amplitude contains a description of the crossed baryon poles , the crossed - box diagram shown in fig .  5",
    "is automatically included , although in an approximate fashion .",
    "the overall isospin factors for the isospin @xmath39 and @xmath36 contributions to the @xmath0 amplitudes are ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 being the isospin projection operators for the @xmath39 and @xmath36 cases ) @xmath42   = 2+{2\\over3}{\\bf \\tau}_1   \\cdot { \\bf \\tau}_2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this very simple argument shows that the strength of the exchange of an effective isoscalar meson is the sum of contributions from both @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath0 channels ( weighted 1 to 2 ) , while the strength of the exchange of an effective isovector meson is the _ difference _ of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 contributions . in a model dominated by the @xmath1 isobar , we expect the effective strengths of the isoscalar and isovector exchanges to be in the ratio of three to one , and to have the same sign",
    ". however , when the @xmath43 contributions to the internal @xmath0 scattering are important ( which is true for the @xmath2 contribution ) , the relative strengths of the different effective exchanges can be very different .",
    "our calculation shows that the relative sizes of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 amplitudes are such that , in the isovector exchange channel , there is an almost perfect ( and unexpected ) cancellation between the two , leaving a very small ( but not zero ) effective isovector exchange force .",
    "this is probably the most surprising result of this work .",
    "signs of this cancellation were present in ref .",
    "@xcite , although it was not seen as spectacularly , since in that paper the @xmath2 resonance was modeled with a width of roughly 1/4 of its present experimental value . yet , in that calculation , the @xmath2 resonance was already found to be needed to oppose the contribution of the @xmath1 to the short range central part of the nn potential .",
    "if all of the external nucleons are on - shell , the tpe exchange amplitude shown in fig .",
    "4 consists of six independent helicity amplitudes for each possible value of the isospin ( @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) in the @xmath47 ( exchange ) channel .",
    "( for a full discussion of the definition of @xmath4 helicity amplitudes see , for example , ref .  @xcite . ) all of these amplitudes were evaluated and compared to those which are obtained from the exchange of a scalar meson ( either @xmath28 , if @xmath45 , or @xmath29 , if @xmath46 ) with an arbitrary mass and coupling constant , and a meson@xmath4 form factor with a cutoff mass around @xmath48@xmath49 gev .",
    "the form factor mass was held constant during each fit , and was chosen to most closely match the energy dependence of the tpe amplitude .",
    "once the form factor mass was chosen , the meson mass and coupling constant were adjusted to give the best fit .",
    "figure 6 shows the quality of the fit for several helicity amplitudes at two different relative momenta @xmath33 of the @xmath4 pair , both corresponding to an energy below the one pion production threshold ( which is at @xmath50 mev / c ) .",
    "note that the fits are quite good , showing that these tpe potentials are well represented by a sum of @xmath28 and @xmath29 exchanges ( at least below the pion production threshold ) .",
    "for each of the isoscalar and isovector channels we also tried fitting to the sum of scalar plus vector exchange terms , which for the @xmath45 channel included @xmath28 and @xmath51 exchanges , and for the @xmath46 channel included @xmath29 and @xmath35 exchanges .",
    "we found that the fits did not significantly improve , showing that the tpe kernel provides little justification for the addition of effective vector mesons to our effective @xmath4 force .",
    "in fact , the deviation from zero of the differences @xmath52 and @xmath53 can not be explained through a @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) exchange alone , but these differences , which increase slowly with energy , were found to be very small .",
    "this result confirms the observation that the full tpe amplitudes can be approximated by the exchange of scalar mesons only ( at least below the pion production threshold ) .",
    "the effective meson parameters resulting from the fits are shown in table i. in both the isoscalar and isovector cases the values obtained for the mass and coupling constant are somewhat smaller than the values obtained from obe models , but are still in reasonable agreement with those results .",
    "figure 7 shows how a typical @xmath4 amplitude ( @xmath54 ) is built up from the different parts of the @xmath0 amplitude , and also displays the cancellation of the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 contributions in the isovector channel .",
    "it also shows that the @xmath1 contribution dominates the isoscalar exchange channel .",
    "we conclude that the large effective @xmath28 exchange , together with the comparatively small effective @xmath29 exchange , both of which are characteristic features of obe models , can be largely explained by the tpe contribution , _ provided the contribution of the @xmath2 resonance is properly included_.    m.  t.  pea thanks the cebaf theory group for its hospitality during her extended visits to cebaf .",
