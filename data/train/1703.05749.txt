    "the magnetic behaviour of spin structures such as domain walls and skyrmionic bubbles in thin ferromagnetic films is determined by the interplay of three energy terms : magnetic anisotropy , heisenberg exchange and the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction .",
    "the strengths of the symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions play a key role in determining the spin structure and energy of a domain wall , with the heisenberg exchange favouring collinear alignment of spins and the dm interaction favouring orthogonal alignment of spins @xcite .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy refers to the energetically favourable crystal axes or geometric directions that the magnetic moments align to and the application of strain to a magnetostrictive ferromagnet gives a degree of control over the anisotropy energy of the material . in recent years",
    "there has been interest in controlling perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in thin films via strain from a piezoelectric material @xcite and we have previously demonstrated control over the creep velocity of domain walls using strain in pt / co / pt thin films @xcite .",
    "we now investigate the balance of effects of the different energies that determine how spin structures such as domain walls in thin films behave by varying co thickness in pt / co / ir thin films and applying external strain .",
    "domain walls in perpendicular anisotropy thin films were initially thought to form only in the bloch structure , such that the energy of magnetic domain walls depended on the effective anisotropy constant @xmath0 and the exchange stiffness @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "it is now understood that the interfacial dm interaction plays a role in the domain wall energy in perpendicular anisotropy thin films with broken inversion symmetry @xcite .",
    "the dm interactions in pt and ir have been found to be of opposite sign @xcite , so are expected to contribute to a large net dm interaction when combined in a asymmetric trilayer such as pt / co / ir .",
    "these trilayers are the building blocks of multilayers where skyrmionic structures have been detected @xcite , making the understanding of their properties key to the development of devices based on the control and motion of chiral spin structures .",
    "while the magnetic anisotropy energy is routinely measured , and the measurement of dm interaction has attracted much interest @xcite , full characterisation of the exchange stiffness @xmath1 in pma thin films is less common . using kerr microscopy and squid - vsm",
    ", we show the effect of varying the thickness of the co layer on the dm interaction and exchange stiffness in pt / co / ir .",
    "we present a characterisation of the magnetic properties of pt / co / ir thin films over a range of co thicknesses exhibiting perpendicular anisotropy . when measuring the dm interaction by the method of je et al .",
    "@xcite , we use the full characterisation of the properties of our pt / co / ir films to discuss the limitations of the method .",
    "we show that , when considering effects where domain wall energy is a factor , it is important to consider all the contributions to it , rather than simply the magnetic anisotropy , as has often been case up to now . both types of exchange can be important for elucidating the role of strain , co layer thickness or perpendicular anisotropy in tuning domain wall velocity , and thus for designing devices from materials with exotic spin textures .",
    "we study the magnetic properties of a series of thin films of ta(4.5nm)/pt(4nm)/co(t)/ir(5 nm ) , with co thickness @xmath3 varying between 0.56 nm and 1.1 nm , deposited onto thin glass substrates by dc magnetron sputtering @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties were measured by a combination of squid - vsm magnetometry and magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke ) microscopy .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy field @xmath4 was measured both from in - plane squid - vsm hysteresis loops and from polar moke versus in - plane field moment rotation ( similar to the method used previously @xcite , with the change in the polar moke signal being proportional to the change in the out - of - plane magnetisation component ) .",
    "the results from the two methods are consistent , with the values from the kerr method used here since this measurement technique is local to the region of the film where the domain wall velocities are measured .",

    "domain wall velocities were measured by quasi - static domain wall imaging using a wide - field moke microscope .",
    "a field pulse was applied to nucleate a reverse domain , an image was recorded , then a second pulse was applied to move the domain wall and a second image was recorded .",
    "the difference of the two images shows a bright region through which the domain wall has moved and , knowing the duration of the field pulse , the domain wall velocity can be calculated .",
    "the dm field was estimated from the asymmetric expansion of reverse domains , imaged by moke microscopy , under out - of - plane driving fields and applied in - plane bias fields @xcite .",

    "there has been some variation in the success of this model in descibing the shape of velocity versus @xmath7 curves .",
    "the model was shown to work well for the pt / co / pt films studied by je et al .",

    "vanatka et al .",
    "@xcite show in pt / co / gd films that velocity versus @xmath7 curves in the flow regime can give curves that are symmetric around the velocity minimum in cases where the creep regime yields unclear results .",
    "however , since the flow regime is not always easily accessible due to the high fields required or the onset of walker breakdown , where possible , the creep regime technique may be the most convenient .",
    "the velocity versus @xmath7 curves we measure for the pt / co / ir thin films are close to the shape expected from the modified creep law , with some variations . figures [ fig_creep_vs_hx ] a and b give a schematic of the expansion of a domain , defining the field and velocity directions , and examples of expanding domains in pt / co(0.7nm)/ir under positive and negative in - plane fields .",
    "a representative example of velocity vs @xmath7 curves extracted from moke images for right and left moving walls ( figure [ fig_creep_vs_hx]c ) shows that the curves have clear minima and , close to the minima , are approximately symmetric around the lowest velocity values . using the measured magnetic properties shown in figure [ fig_4panel_hk_ms_k_a ] and the values of @xmath12 and @xmath21 measured at @xmath7=0 by linear least squares fits of the creep law ( equation [ eq_creep ] ) in the natural log form , @xmath35 to plots of @xmath36 versus @xmath37h@xmath38 , and the dm field taken from the minimum of the curve , the velocity versus @xmath7 curves expected from the modified creep model ( equation [ eq_creep ] ) were calculated . comparing the calculated curves with the data shows that there is fairly good agreement , suggesting that taking the field at which the velocity is at a minimum as the dm field gives a good estimate .",
    "taking the minima of the velocity versus @xmath7 curves as the dm field gives values that depend on the co thickness .",
    "figure [ fig_2panel_hd_d ] shows the measured values of dm field , given as @xmath39 and the dm energy density d , where d is calculated from @xmath40 .",
    "the dm field has a linear dependence on @xmath19 , with pt / co / ir films with thicker co having a small dmi and those with thinner co having a larger dmi .",
    "none of the pt / co / ir films have a sufficiently larger dm field to fully overcome the domain wall shape anisotropy that favours bloch walls , so all will have domain walls with a combination of the bloch and nel spin structures .",
    "we can investigate the velocity versus @xmath7 creep motion by extracting creep parameters .",
    "the velocity versus @xmath7 curves shown in figure [ fig_creep_vs_hx ] were taken at five different out - of - plane fields so that the creep parameters @xmath21 and @xmath12 could be extracted from linear least squares fits of the natural log form of the creep law ( equation [ eq_lnv ] ) , to plots of @xmath36 versus @xmath37h@xmath38 .",
    "the results , presented in figure [ fig_alpha_lnv0_rough]a show that both the energy barrier @xmath12 and the scaling parameter @xmath21 change with applied in - plane field .",
    "the variation of @xmath12 with @xmath7 expected from the modified creep model , calculated using the measured magnetic properties of pt / co / ir and plotted in figure [ fig_alpha_lnv0_rough]a , does not follow that same shape as the data .",
    "a limitation of the modified creep law that becomes clear from analysis of the creep parameters is the omission of a dependence on @xmath7 for @xmath15 . while the modified creep model includes a variation in the energy barrier @xmath12 with @xmath7 , it does nt account for the changes @xmath41 , which can be seen from figure [ fig_alpha_lnv0_rough]a to have a dependence on @xmath7 very similar to that of @xmath12 .",
    "we can look to recent work on the creep law to see how we might expect @xmath15 and @xmath12 to have similar @xmath7 dependence .",
    "jeudy et al .",
    "showed that @xmath42 \\label{eq_creep_juedy1}\\ ] ] where t is the temperature and the universal creep energy barrier , @xmath43 , \\label{eq_creep_juedy2}\\ ] ] gave good agreement with creep velocity data from a variety of materials and a large driving field range . for the purpose of investigating the extracted creep parameters we may write this as @xmath44 such that our extracted creep parameters are then given as @xmath45 and , as shown in equation [ eq_alpha ] , @xmath46 at @xmath47 , and on application of a bias field @xmath48 , @xmath49 given the very similar shape of the variation of @xmath15 and @xmath12 with @xmath7 ( figure [ fig_alpha_lnv0_rough ] )",
    ", we can then conclude that there is also a modification to @xmath15 that depends on @xmath7 , related to the modification to the pinning energy barrier , in this case in an approximately linear manner .",
    "in studying the difference between the modified @xmath34 creep model and the data , the roughness of the wall is also an important factor since the model must assume a smooth domain wall .",
    "figure [ fig_alpha_lnv0_rough]b and c show the difference we might expect between the behaviour of a smooth and rough bn wall under applied in - plane bias fields .",
    "the dm field always acts perpendicular to the line of the wall , so for a smooth wall , the dm field and applied bias field in the section of the wall that we measure are always parallel or anti - parallel , and the magnetisation direction in the centre of the wall will rotate due to the relative size of the two fields . in a rough wall ,",
    "the direction of the dm field will vary with respect to the applied bias field , so the balance between the two fields will vary along the wall and the magnetisation direction in the centre of the wall will only behave as we expect when for sections of wall where the dm and bias field align along a common axis . as a consequence of the variation in angle between the two fields , a rough wall can never take on a fully bloch or fully nel structure when a bias field is applied .",
    "this has the effect of suppressing changes in velocity due to the variation in wall energy with bias field and preventing the wall from reaching the higher velocities that should be possible for a nel wall , as can be seen in figure [ fig_creep_vs_hx ] .",
    "so far we have studied the magnetic properties of unstrained pt / co / ir films .",
    "we have characterised the magnetic properties on which the energy of a domain wall depends , with respect to varying co layer thickness .",
    "we have used a domain wall @xmath34 method to estimate the size of the dm interaction and found that the creep parameters @xmath15 and @xmath12 do not behave as expected , particularly at large in - plane bias fields .",
    "we can understand the difference between the data and creep model in figure [ fig_2panel_hd_d ] as relating to the roughness of the domain walls , which causes a variation in the angles between the bias field and dm field along the wall that reduces the effect of the bias field on the wall velocity and slows the wall at large @xmath7 values .",
    "curves are shown for an unstrained ( 0v ) and 0.1% strained ( 150v ) pt / co(0.89nm)/ir film on a piezoelectric transducer .",
    "the solid lines are guides to the eye .",
    "b ) the proportional change in domain wall creep velocity under 0.1% strain , the proportional change in domain wall energy due to 0.1% strain and the domain wall energy in unstrained ( 0v ) and 0.1% strained ( 150v ) pt / co(t)/ir are plotted against co thickness @xmath19 .",
    ", width=302 ]    we now investigate the effect of strain from a piezoelectric transducer on the domain walls in pt / co / ir thin films .",
    "pt / co(t)/ir films with co layers in the range t = 0.56 - 0.89 nm were bonded to biaxial piezoelectric transducers . as we have found previously for similar pt / co / pt thin films @xcite",
    ", the maximum strain of 0.1% out - of - plane reduced the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy by 10kj / m@xmath9 .",
    "figure [ fig_strain ] shows the effect this anisotropy change has on the velocity versus @xmath7 curves . the velocity increase and the slight narrowing of the curve are consistent with a lowering of the effective anisotropy and a reduction of the creep energy barrier @xmath12 .",
    "the position of the velocity minimum does not change measurably , meaning that the dm field is not significantly affected by the 0.1% out - of - plane strain .    for pt",
    "pt we previously found the domain wall creep velocity in thicker co films to be more sensitive to strain : the percentage change in the velocity under strain increased as the film thickness increased , even though the anisotropy change was the same for different thicknesses . using the same methods as for pt / co / pt @xcite we measure domain wall creep in thin films of pt / co / ir under piezoelectric strain and",
    "find the opposite trend with thickness .",
    "figure [ fig_strain]b shows the proportional change in creep velocity @xmath50 between the unstrained and 0.1% strained films , averaged over many out - of - plane driving fields and with no in - plane fields applied . in pt / co / ir , the largest change in velocity is a 42% increase in the film with thinnest co ( t = 0.56 nm ) .",
    "since the change in velocity is due to a 10 kj / m@xmath9 reduction in magnetic anisotropy of all samples , the higher anisotropy of films with thinner co means a lower proportional change in anisotropy .",
    "we might expect this to induce a smaller change in the energy barrier to domain wall motion , and so a smaller change in velocity , as was found in pt / co / pt .",
    "however , the energy of the domain wall depends not just on the magnetic anisotropy energy , but also the exchange energies .",
    "the domain wall energy for the unstrained and 0.1% strained films can be calculated from equation [ eq_bn ] and is plotted in figure [ fig_strain ] , along with the proportional change in domain wall energy due to strain .",
    "note that , although there is a dm interaction in these films , it is not large enough to give the domain walls a nel structure and only gives a small reduction in the domain wall energy .",
    "using the magnetic properties from figures [ fig_4panel_hk_ms_k_a ] and [ fig_2panel_hd_d ] to calculate domain wall energy , the relative size of the change of domain wall energy under strain is very close to the relative size of the change of creep velocity .",
    "the change in domain wall velocity is due to how the change in @xmath0 affects domain wall energy , thus the trend in co thickness of @xmath51 can be understood as a balance of exchange and anisotropy terms .",
    "the magnitudes and observed trend of symmetric exchange @xmath1 with thickness are similar to calculated values for pt / co / pt thin films @xcite .",
    "the exchange stiffness exhibits a similar behaviour with ferromagnetic layer thickness as reported by nembach et al .",
    "@xcite , however , unlike in the ni@xmath52fe@xmath53/pt system we find that the symmetric and antisymmetric exchange have the opposite dependence on the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer .",
    "there are a number of differences between the thin films in the two studies that might contribute to the difference in the effect of layer thickness on the interfacial dm interaction : nembach et al .",
    "use relatively thick ni@xmath52fe@xmath53 ( t = 0.8 - 10 nm ) , deposited on sin and capped with heavy pt , whereas we use ultra - thin co ( t = 0.56 - 1.05 nm ) with heavy metals below ( pt ) and above ( ir ) .",
    "the presence of two heavy metal layers interacting with a single magnetic species to give opposite signs of the dm interaction at the top and bottom interfaces , and with pt as an underlayer rather than a cap , could be expected to have a different effect to a single layer of heavy pt interacting with an magnetic alloy .",
    "the reduction of @xmath54 with increasing co thickness is consistent with the understanding of the dm interaction in heavy - metal / ferromagnet trilayers as a interfacial effect @xcite .",
    "the trend with co thickness shows that we would expect there be no net dm field in pt / co / ir films with co layers thicker than 1.25 nm , at which point the dominance of in - plane volume magnetic anisotropy indicates that the magnetic properties become less dependent on the interfaces .",
    "although the thickness dependence of the dm field and anisotropy are similar , there are some differences such as a change in the slope of the anisotropy versus @xmath19 that is not present in the dm field .",
    "whilst both properties are dependent on the interfaces , the dependence is not the same , which is consistent with the finding from calculations by yang et al . that @xmath55 is not correlated to an enhancement in the pt moment that would contribute to the perpendicular anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the correlation of the changes in domain wall energy and creep velocity under piezoelectric strain show that by knowing the magnetic properties of a material with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy , we are able to predict the degree of strain control of domain wall velocity possible . to optimise strain control , we should choose materials systems whose properties give low domain wall energies , i.e. materials with which , as much as possible , balance low magnetic anisotropy energy , low heisenberg exchange energy , and higher dm exchange energy .",
    "we have measured the magnetic properties of pt / co / ir thin films , including the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy , heisenberg exchange stiffness and interfacial dm constant , with respect to varying co layer thickness .",
    "when investigating the domain wall @xmath34 method to used to estimate the size of the dm interaction , we found that the creep parameters @xmath15 and @xmath12 do not behave as expected , particularly at large in - plane bias fields .",
    "we propose that this difference is related to the roughness of the domain walls , which varies the angles between the bias field and dm field along the wall , reducing the effect of the bias field on the velocity of the domain walls .",
    "we have shown that the dm constant is not significantly affected by biaxial strain from a piezoelectric transducer .",
    "we demonstrate that the sensitivity of the domain wall creep velocity to strain is set by the size of the domain wall energy , which confirms the relevance of the domain wall energy for determining the pinning energy barrier in the creep law , and allows for prediction of the size of the effect of strain on creep velocity .",
    "domain wall energy depends on the balance of magnetic anisotropy energy and symmetric and antisymmetric exchange energies , which are all affected by the structural parameters of trilayer thin films , such as the magnetic layer thickness . in order to tune the domain wall velocity in perpendicular anisotropy",
    "thin films , materials should be designed not only by considering the commonly measured magnetic anisotropy energy , but also the symmetric and antisymmetric exchange energies .",
    "these factors should be balanced to give a domain wall energy to produce a large change in domain wall energy for a given strain .",

    "<S> measurements of the co layer thickness dependence of saturation magnetisation , perpendicular magnetic anisotropy , and symmetric and antisymmetric exchange energies in pt / co / ir thin films have been made to determine the relationship between these properties . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the enhancement of domain wall creep velocity under strain from piezoelectric transducers is increased in pt / co / ir films with the thinnest co layers ( 0.56 nm ) , in which the strain causes the smallest relative change in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we show how domain wall energy is predictive of the sensitivity of domain wall creep velocity to changes in strain , and thus provide a route to designing materials systems for optimum strain control . </S>"
