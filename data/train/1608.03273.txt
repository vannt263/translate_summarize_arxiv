    "the study of the universe has undergone serious changes , as theoretical than observational during the last decades .",
    "the cosmology , which attaches to understand the global properties and large structures of the universe ( their origin , their evolution , theirs characteristics ... ) is entered an era precision .",
    "this discipline has long been a highly speculative domain and reposed as much on metaphysics than physics . with the formulation in @xmath8 of the theory of general relativity ,",
    "a coherent theoretical framework allowing mathematisation of space and time has become appeared .",
    "one could then , in @xmath9 , formulate the cosmological models based on this theory .",
    "these models of the universe , whose main characteristic is to be expanding , helped to understand many observations such as the recession of galaxies revealed by edwin hubble . during twenty years",
    ", the cosmology is confined to the description and the reconstruction of this expansion . in the second period , starting around @xmath10 , the study of physical processes in an expanding space allowed to formulate the big bang model .",
    "this model based on einstein s theory of @xmath11 is one of the great succes stories in modern theoretical physic and it describes a universe that is isotropic and homogeneous on large scales .",
    "recent observations of the supernovae type ia ( sne ia ) @xcite , the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) surveys @xcite , the large scale structure @xcite and the weak lensing @xcite , clearly indicate that the universe is currently expanding with an accelerating rate .",
    "these recent observations of the universe also possesses some problems for the standard model of cosmology and requires the presence of a dark energy component whose nature is not well understood . in order to explain the acceleration of the universe without introducing such a tantalizing source of energy ,",
    "other gravitation theories have been designed .",
    "the palatini @xmath12 gravity is also proposed first as an alternative to dark energy in a series of works @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there has since been growing interest in these modified gravity theories : for the local tests of the palatini and metric @xmath12 gravity models see @xcite-@xcite , and for the cosmologies of these two classes of models see @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a generalization of @xmath12 theory , namely @xmath13 gravity , was introduced first in ref.@xcite and then , studied in refs.@xcite-@xcite with interesting results .",
    "the @xmath13 gravity model depends on a source term , representing the variation of the matter energy - momentum tensor with respect to the metric .",
    "the justification for the dependence on @xmath2 comes from inductions arising from some exotic fluid and/or quantum effects ( conformal anomaly ) .",
    "actually , this induction point of view adopts or links with the known proposals such as geometrical curvature inducing matter , a geometrical description of physical forces , and a geometrical origin for the matter content of the universe .",
    "recently , @xmath14 theory has been generalized by introducing the contribution from contraction of the ricci tensor and energy - momentum tensor named as @xmath15 gravity @xcite-@xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is generally non - conserved and extra force is present as a result of non - minimal matter geometry coupling .",

    "@xcite have discussed the cosmological implications of this theory and developed the dolgov - kawasaki instability criterion .",
    "the problem of matter instability in @xmath16 gravity is discussed by odintsov and sez gomez @xcite .",
    "sharif and zubair @xcite-@xcite have presented the field equations for more general case and formulated energy conditions and the thermodynamic laws in @xmath16 modified gravity . because of the + interesting aspects and the progress realized by these authors , it seems there is still room to study some motivating gravitational and cosmological aspects of such modified gravity which have not yet been studied . in the context of @xmath17 ) modified theories of gravity , the stability of the einstein static universe was also analyzed by considering homogeneous perturbations @xcite . by considering specific forms of @xmath12",
