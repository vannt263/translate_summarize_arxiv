    "recently yaman et al . @xcite obtained the surprising result that the surface tension @xmath0 of a fluid of thin hard rods at a spherical or cylindrical wall of radius @xmath1 is non - analytical at curvature @xmath2 .",
    "they found different expressions for @xmath3 for positive and negative curvatures .",
    "this analysis that assumed ideal particles has been extended by groh and dietrich @xcite by taking into account the interactions between the particles .",
    "this leads to a substantial change of the curvature dependence at medium and high particle densities , but a small singular contribution probably still remains . in the present work we return to the ideal limit but generalize the problem in two respects .",
    "first , we explicitly study arbitrarily shaped surfaces with locally varying curvatures .",
    "this is especially important because due to the mentioned singularity the curvature dependence of the surface free energy can not have the common helfrich form @xcite .",
    "therefore it is not possible to derive the general expression from the special cases of spherical and cylindrical surfaces .",
    "indeed , we find different analytical expressions depending on the signs of the local curvatures which take on an unexpected form especially at hyperbolic points .",
    "second , we allow for a finite thickness of the rod - like particles , with the known result for spherical particles included as a limiting case .    one might ask if and how the curvature dependent surface free energy is experimentally accessible .",
    "this is indeed the case for surfaces that are free to adjust their curvature to the conditions provided by the surrounding liquid .",
    "such surfaces are given by vesicles which consist of closed liquid bilayer membranes in an aqueous solution .",
    "their shapes are experimentally observable by phase - contrast microscopy @xcite .",
    "theoretically vesicles are commonly modeled as two - dimensional continuum surfaces with bending elasticity . in the simplest model",
    "the elastic energy of the membrane has just the helfrich form .",
    "different classes of equilibrium shapes have been determined as local energy minima ( for some especially interesting examples see [ jie:98 ] ) . for the most relevant",
    "parameter ranges the corresponding phase diagram has been worked out in detail @xcite .",
    "the presence of other particles in the solution gives rise to an additional energy contribution . due to a change of the effective spontaneous curvature the vesicle may tend to bend towards or away from the solute particles .",
    "the effects of absorbed and free polymers and of spherical colloidal particles have been reviewed by lipowsky et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we study the corresponding problem for rod - like particles .",
    "in contrast to the other cases , here the total elastic energy including the solute effects no longer has the helfrich form .",
    "thus new equilibrium shapes arise and the phase diagram is modified in a way that can not be reduced to a simple renormalization of the parameters .",
    "we study a system of hard spherocylinders of length @xmath4 and diameter @xmath5 in the presence of a hard wall of general shape whose principal radii of curvature @xmath6 and @xmath7 are large compared to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the interactions between the rod - like particles are neglected , i.e. , we consider the dilute limit . in this section",
    "we calculate the surface free energy of the rods , which is then used in the second part of the paper to determine equilibrium shapes of vesicles immersed in the rod solution .    using the grand - canonical density -",
    "functional it can easily be shown @xcite that the surface contribution @xmath8 to the grand - canonical potential of the fluid is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the density of rods whose center of mass is at the point @xmath11 and whose orientation is @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the particle density of the bulk fluid far away from the wall . due to the hard wall",
    "potential @xmath14 has either the value 0 or 1 , depending on whether the configuration @xmath15 is forbidden by the presence of the surface or not .",
    "the ideal particles we assumed only `` feel '' the wall within a layer of thickness @xmath16 so that the spatial integration in eq .",
    "( [ omsgen ] ) can be restricted to this layer .",
    "we introduce a local coordinate system at each point of the surface whose @xmath17 axis points along the normal direction into the rod solution and whose @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes are aligned with the principal directions . as we are only interested in the leading terms in the curvature we approximate the position of the surface by @xmath20 where we introduced the convention that a curvature @xmath21 is positive if the surface curves _ away _ from the fluid .",
    "now @xmath8 can be written as a surface integral over the free energy density @xmath22 : @xmath23 with @xmath24 the jacobian @xmath25 takes into account the change of the tangential area element @xmath26 with the normal distance @xmath17 .",
    "the range of orientations @xmath27 for which the particle intersects the surface ( i.e , for which @xmath28 ) for given curvatures @xmath29 and @xmath30 and normal distance @xmath17 can be found by straightforward geometry .",
    "we first consider the limit of infinitely thin rods ( @xmath31 ) . at given azimuthal angle @xmath32 around the normal direction we determine the maximum allowed value @xmath33 for the cosine of the polar angle , at which the rod just touches the surface .",
    "this is a two - dimensional problem within the plane @xmath34 that intersects the surface in the parabola @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the tangential coordinate within the plane ) with @xmath37 note that @xmath38 can be positive or negative depending on the signs of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ fig : touch ] shows that for positive curvatures there are two possibilities how the thin rod can touch the surface : tangentially for @xmath39 and with its end for @xmath40 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath41 with @xmath42 for negative curvatures the rod can not approach the surface closer than @xmath43 so that @xmath44 for @xmath39 while for @xmath40 one has @xmath45 as before .",
    "note that @xmath33 is analytic at @xmath46 only if @xmath40 while different expressions apply for @xmath47 if @xmath39 . the surface free energy density now follows by integration over @xmath32 : @xmath48 up to terms quadratic in the curvature one obtains @xmath49 and @xmath50 if @xmath51 and @xmath52 the function @xmath38 changes sign at the angle @xmath53 and the @xmath32 integration must be split accordingly .",

    "{ \\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of course the same formula with @xmath29 and @xmath30 interchanged applies for @xmath55 and @xmath56 . thus depending on the signs of the principal curvatures @xmath22",
    "is given by eq .",

    "( [ fspp ] ) is exact for a convex surface to all orders in the curvature .",
    "our new result eq .",
    "( [ fspm ] ) provides a continuous connection between eq .",
    "( [ fspp ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ fsmm ] ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fspsi ] where @xmath22 is plotted for @xmath57 and @xmath58 as a function of @xmath59 for fixed @xmath60 .",
    "obviously the presence of the rods favors surfaces with two negative principal curvatures .",
    "terms linear in the curvature are absent in all cases .",
    "the quadratic terms are non - analytic if one of the @xmath61 s changes sign , which , inter alia , precludes writing the curvature dependence of the surface free energy in the common helfrich form @xmath62 with the bending rigidities @xmath63 and @xmath64 and the spontaneous curvature @xmath65 .",
    "if one restricts oneself to equal signs of @xmath29 and @xmath30 we have rigorously shown here that the helfrich form can be applied with @xmath66 and @xmath67 for negative and , trivially , @xmath68 for positive curvatures .",
    "however , surfaces of vesicles typically exhibit regions with differing signs , so that a global mapping to the helfrich form is no longer possible .",
    "the case of spherocylindrical particles with finite thickness @xmath5 can be reduced to the problem for @xmath31 discussed above if one realizes that the surface of the spherocylinder consists of all points that have a distance @xmath69 from the line segment of length @xmath4 which connects the centers of the hemispherical caps . thus if the spherocylinder touches the surface @xmath70 this line segment touches a parallel surface @xmath71 shifted by @xmath69 .",
    "the curvature radii of @xmath71 and @xmath70 are simply related by @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 @xcite , so that for @xmath74 @xmath75 the particles can not approach the wall closer than @xmath76 . the inaccessible range yields the @xmath4 independent contribution @xmath77 to the free energy density . by using the fact that @xmath78 one obtains for the remaining @xmath17 integral from @xmath69 to @xmath16 @xmath79 now the above results for infinitely thin rods can be employed to give the final result @xmath80 with @xmath81 , \\qquad    c_1>0 , c_2<0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is remarkable that all the additional terms which contain powers of @xmath5 are analytic in @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the singular contributions @xmath82 are exactly the same as in the limit @xmath83 . in this sense",
    "no qualitatively new features arise when the thickness of the rods is taken into account .",
    "therefore we only consider thin rods in the second part of this paper .",
    "the special case of hard non - interacting spheres is also contained in the above analysis for @xmath84 . only in this case the full @xmath22 is analytic and thus lends itself to the helfrich expansion .",
    "our result for the spheres is in agreement with previous calculations @xcite .",
    "we now consider a vesicle immmersed in a solution of rodlike colloids .",
    "it is assumed that the rods are not absorbed on the membrane and that their interaction can be approximated by the hard wall model .",
    "the bending energy of the vesicle consists of two contributions : first , the internal bending rigidity of the membrane which is described in the so - called spontaneous curvature model as given by eq .",
    "( [ fhel ] ) ( for other possibilities see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , the presence of the rodlike particles gives rise to the surface free energy determined in the previous section .",
    "if the vesicle is immersed in a solution of polymers @xcite or diluted spherical colloids this second contribution will have the same analytical form as the first and therefore lead to a renormalization of the rigidity coefficients and the spontaneous curvature of the `` free '' vesicle .",
    "then the equilibrium shapes are those determined for the pure spontaneous curvature model @xcite and the addition of the solute only shifts the system to a different point in the phase diagram . however , in the present case the energy contribution due to the rods can not be written in the helfrich form so that new equilibrium shapes will arise .",
    "as shown in sec .",
    "[ finited ] a non - zero thickness of the rods can also be taken into account by using renormalized coefficients in @xmath85 .",
    "therefore in the following we only use the expressions for infinitely thin rods .    because the energy scale associated with the bending rigidity @xmath63 is much smaller than the energies necessary to change significantly the area @xmath86 or the volume @xmath87 of the vesicles , these quantities are regarded as fixed .",
    "thus the equilibrium shape is determined by minimization of @xmath88 under the constraint of fixed @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "due to the scale invariance of @xmath89 the equilibrium shape depends only on the dimensionless parameters @xmath90 a sphere is characterized by @xmath91 , while for any other shape @xmath92 .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 measures the relative importance of the contribution @xmath8 due to the rods .",
    "the gaussian curvature term proportional to @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ fhel ] ) is constant for topologically equivalent shapes and will be omitted since we consider only shapes with the same topology as the sphere .",
    "we will focus on the region @xmath93 and moderate values of @xmath94 where the equilibrium shapes of the pure spontaneous curvature model are axisymmetric prolates or oblates with up - down symmetry , separated by a first - order transition @xcite .    rather than deriving and solving the exact euler - lagrange shape equations we parametrize the surfaces by simple two - parameter functions .",
    "in cylindrical coordinates @xmath95 around the axis of symmetry we write @xcite @xmath96 these shapes reduce to ellipsoids for @xmath97 while increasing the value of @xmath98 leads to a bulging which finally yields non - convex shapes for @xmath99 .",
    "the parameter @xmath100 is the aspect ratio of the shape , i.e. , the ratio of its diameter in the equatorial plane and its length along the symmetry axis ( or vice versa for oblates ) .",
    "we emphasize that the bending energy does not depend on the size of the vesicles so that the length of one axis can be arbitrarily set to unity .",
    "the corresponding vesicle volumes are @xmath101\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the areas @xmath102 the principal curvatures are @xmath103 for prolates and @xmath104 for oblates .",
    "all curvatures are positive for @xmath105 . in the prolate case @xmath106",
    "becomes negative for @xmath39 where @xmath107 is the positive solution of @xmath108 for oblates three ranges must be distinguished : for @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is again determined by eq .",
    "( [ zc ] ) , both curvatures are negative . between @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath112 is positive and @xmath113 is negative , while for @xmath114 both curvatures are positive .",
    "the rod contribution to the elastic energy is computed from @xmath115 the equilibrium shapes follow by numerical minimization of the total elastic energy @xmath116 with respect to @xmath98 where @xmath117 is obtained by numerical solution of the first equation of eq .",
    "( [ defvc0x ] ) .    if the rods are inside instead of outside the vesicle the signs of the curvatures @xmath61 have to be reversed in the computation of @xmath8 . for the case of particles on",
    "_ both _ sides of the membrane @xmath118 must be replaced by @xmath119 which , interestingly , has the form given by eq .",
    "( [ fsmm ] ) for _ all _ signs of the @xmath61 .",
    "hence here the helfrich form is valid , as has been surmised by yaman et al .",
    "@xcite , so that for @xmath120 the equilibrium shape does not depend on the rod concentration @xmath18 .",
    "we first discuss the results for zero spontaneous curvature .",
    "if @xmath99 the shape can be characterized by a `` bulging '' parameter @xmath121 which is equal to the ratio of the maximum of @xmath122 [ @xmath123 and its value in the equatorial plane [ along the symmetry axis ] for prolates [ oblates ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape ] the quantities @xmath100 and @xmath124 are shown as a function of @xmath18 for a prolate and an oblate at @xmath125 values in the vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "rods outside a prolate tend to decrease @xmath100 and increase @xmath124 thereby narrowing the waist of the vesicle .",
    "similarly an oblate develops stronger `` dips '' at the symmetry axis in order to increase the range and degree of negative curvature .",
    "these results confirm our previous observation that the surface prefers to bend towards the rods .",
    "figure  [ fig : shpcx ] shows some examples for shapes without and with rods outside and inside the vesicle .",
    "the changes of @xmath100 and @xmath124 are much smaller for prolates ( 0.41.3% at @xmath126 ) than for oblates ( 1015% ) .",
    "identifying the most probable shape with the lowest energy shape is problematic when the energy is a non - analytic function of the shape which might be non - quadratic for small deviations from the energy minimum @xcite .",
    "however , numerically the function @xmath127 shows no traces of non - analyticity .",
    "in fact , the integrand @xmath118 is singular only on a set of measure zero ( on the curves determined by @xmath128 ) so that the singularity is probably removed by the integration .    without rods the phase transition between prolates and oblates takes place at @xmath129 within our approximation which is very close to the value @xmath130 obtained by an exact minimization @xcite .",
    "the coexisting shapes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : shpcx ] ) both are strongly non - spherical with an aspect ratio @xmath131 which indicates a pronounced first - order character of the transition . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phas ] the rods shift the transition to larger @xmath125 if they are outside the vesicle and to smaller @xmath125 inside . as explained above rods on both sides effectively just change the value of @xmath63 but do not influence the phase diagram .",
    "we now turn to the more general case of non - zero spontaneous curvature @xmath94 .",
    "negative values of @xmath94 favor oblate shapes so that the transition point moves to higher volume to surface ratios @xmath125 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasc0 ] ) .",
    "it has been shown rigorously that the phase boundary approaches @xmath91 at @xmath132 @xcite . by a series expansion of the elastic energy around @xmath91",
    "one finds that this also hold within the present parametrization .",
    "the presence of rods outside the vesicle shifts the transition line to larger @xmath125 .",
    "however , no shift occurs for @xmath133 because in this range both coexisting shapes are convex ( @xmath105 ) so that @xmath134 .",
    "rods on both side of the membrane give rise to an additional helfrich like term with @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "therefore the effective bending rigidity is @xmath137 and the effective spontaneous curvature is @xmath138 for this reason the curve for particles on both sides differs from the curve for @xmath139 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasc0 ] ( except at @xmath120 ) and reaches @xmath91 at @xmath140 , whereas both curves are identical if plotted as a function of @xmath141 instead of @xmath94 ( fig .  [ fig : phasc0s ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath142 becomes negative for @xmath143 . in this case the present analysis breaks down and higher order terms in the curvature must be taken into account .",
    "if the rods are restricted to the inside of the vesicle the same effective helfrich form applies as long as only convex shapes are considered .",
    "this explains why the corresponding phase boundary is equal to that for rods on both sides at large @xmath125 .",
    "however , for smaller @xmath125 shapes with differing signs of the curvatures occur which can not be accounted for by a simple rescaling of the helfrich coefficients and which shift the transition line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasc0s ] to lower @xmath125 compared to the pure helfrich case .",
    "in summary , we have shown that if rod - like particles are present on the outer or inner side of a vesicle its equilibrium shape changes .",
    "because the curvature dependence of the surface free energy of the solutes can not be written in the helfrich form their effect can not be described by a simple rescaling of the bending rigidity coefficients .",
    "we have quantitatively computed the shape changes and the shift of the prolate - oblate transition line in the phase diagram .    in order to decide whether these effects are large enough to be observable in experiments",
    "an estimate for the quantity @xmath144 is needed .",
    "the bending rigidity is typically of the order of @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "if the rod density @xmath13 is too large the rod - rod interaction becomes important which might screen the interesting effects @xcite .",
    "since these interactions scale with the second virial coefficient @xmath146 a useful dimensionless measure for their strength is @xmath147 .",
    "so even if @xmath148 must be limited to a small number , 0.1 say , @xmath18 can in principle be made arbitrarily large by choosing large enough aspect ratios @xmath149 . in practice , however , one would need @xmath150 to obtain @xmath151 .",
    "this is much higher than for the `` classical '' rod - like colloidal particles like the tobacco mosaic virus @xcite but may be achievable with microtubules for which @xmath152 and @xmath4 can be tens of micrometers . rather large vesicles would have to be used so that the curvature radii are still large compared to @xmath4 which justifies the neglection of higher order terms in the curvature .    microtubules and many other mesoscopic rod - like particles are usually polydisperse .",
    "thus a useful extension of the present work would be the inclusion of polydispersity which poses no fundamental technical problems as long as the interparticle interactions can still be neglected .",
    "a generalization to soft particle - wall interactions seems to be more difficult as no simple analytical expressions for more realistic potentials exist .",
    "finally we mention that contrary to what is claimed in [ yaman:97:prl ] the corresponding problem for disks instead of rods is not completely equivalent .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself with a coin and a cup that there are configurations where a disk touches the inside of a cylinder at two isolated points whose distance is smaller than the disk diameter .",
    "the orientational constraints due to these configurations obviously can not be described by replacing the disk with an equivalent rod .",
