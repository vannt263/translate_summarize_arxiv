    "the particular attention is recently focused on the similarity between superfluid turbulence and conventional turbulence@xcite . in conventional turbulence ,",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath5 has the kolmogorov form @xmath6 for wavenumbers @xmath7 in an inertial range .",
    "such spectrum was observed indirectly by stalp _ et al_. in superfluid @xmath8he above 1.4k@xcite , in spite of the fact that the rotational flow in the superfluid component must take the form of discrete quantized vortex lines , and that there can be no conventional viscous dissipation in the superfluid component .",
    "this is understood by the idea that the superfluid and the normal fluid are likely to be coupled together by the mutual friction and to behave like a conventional fluid@xcite . since the density of the normal fluid is negligible at mk temperatures , an important question now arises : even free from the normal fluid ,",
    "is the superfluid turbulence still similar to the conventional turbulence or not ?",
    "recently nore _",
    "et al_. solved the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation and discussed similarity to the kolmogorov law@xcite .",
    "however this simulation includes such complicated compressible effects as the radiation of sound from the vortex lines , the interaction between vortex lines and sound , etc . in order to consider pure superfluid turbulence in a simpler situation , we study the energy spectrum of the 3d velocity field induced by the vortex tangle under the vortex filament model which describes the dynamics of incompressible fluid .",
    "for superfluid @xmath8he , the vortex filament model is very useful , because the vortex core radius @xmath9 cm is microscopic and the circulation @xmath10@xmath11/sec is fixed by quantum constraint .",
    "thus the dynamics of vortices is calculated numerically by the biot - savart law which is described in our previous paper@xcite . in our calculation ,",
    "a vortex filament is represented by a single string of points at a distance @xmath12 apart . when two vortices approach within @xmath12 , it is assumed that they are reconnected .",
    "the computational sample is taken to be a cube of size @xmath131 cm .",
    "this calculation assumes the walls to be smooth and takes account of image vortices so that the boundary condition may be satisfied .",
    "we will introduce the energy spectrum of the velocity field induced by the vortex filament .",
    "using parseval s theorem @xmath14 , the kinetic energy can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the superfluid density . by using the relation @xmath17",
    ", we obtain the kinetic energy : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fourier component of the vorticity @xmath20 . in the vortex filament model",
    ", the vorticity can be defined as @xmath21 , so that @xmath19 is given by @xmath22 a vortex filament is represented by the parametric form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 refers to a point on the filament , the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the arc length @xmath25 and the integration is taken along the filament .",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath5 is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "finally we obtain the energy spectrum : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the volume element @xmath29 in the spherical coordinate .",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath5 is calculated for the vortex configuration @xmath30 obtained by the simulation of the dynamics .",
    "in order to make clear the statistical properties of superfluid turbulence , we calculated the energy spectra of the 3d velocity field for dilute and dense vortex tangles respectively .",
    "first we discuss the energy spectrum for a dilute vortex tangle .",
