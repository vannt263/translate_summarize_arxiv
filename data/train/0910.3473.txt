    "the only pure states which saturate the schrdinger - robertson @xcite uncertainty relation for the canonically conjugated coordinate and momenta , are the gaussian states .",
    "the latter , due to hudson s theorem @xcite , are also the only pure states with strictly positive wigner function @xcite .",
    "one may naturally wonder how these theorems can be extended to mixed states , and whether the gaussian  link between them persists .    in the space of mixed states , different forms of uncertainty relation",
    "have been suggested varying with the choice of the quantities characterizing the mixed states i.e. purity , purities of higher order or various entropies ( see @xcite for a review ) . among these proposals ,",
    "a basic one , i.e. expressed in a closed form , is the _ purity - bounded uncertainty relation _ suggested by dodonov and manko @xcite .",
    "according to this relation  the minimum uncertainty is a function of the purity characterizing the degree of the mixedeness of a state . in a more recent work dodonov @xcite",
    "has proven that the mixed states which minimize this relation possess positive wigner functions and that they are not extremely far  from gaussian states of the same purity . if instead of the purity , the von neumann entropy is employed as a measure degree of mixedeness , the results are not identical .",
    "bastiaans @xcite has derived an uncertainty relation based on the von neumann entropy of mixed states , the _ entropy - bounded uncertainty relation _ and has proven that the mixed states of minimum uncertainty are the thermal ( gaussian ) states .",
    "these results already give a preliminary answer to the questions we posed suggesting that , the link between the ability to minimize relevant uncertainty relations and positivity of wigner functions seem to persist in the space of mixed states , though the gaussianity is no longer a  necessary requirement for extremality of the uncertainty .",
    "however , to be able to answer our questions in more complete way we need to have a closer view on the set of mixed states with positive wigner functions .    in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have formulated an extension of hudson s theorem , by identifying the maximum degree of deviation from a gaussian state which can be reached by a mixed state with positive wigner function , given its purity and its uncertainty .",
    "this problem does not have a simple solution and in @xcite we have only identified the bounds for any continuous classical distribution which may not necessarily correspond to a valid wigner function , and therefore the bounds are not tight for the set of quantum states .    in view of this discussion , we extend in this work the purity - bounded uncertainty relation by adding one more parameter , the non - gaussianity characterizing the distance of the state from a gaussian state with the same covariance matrix . in this way we are able to draw more complete conclusions on the overlap between states minimizing this uncertainty relation and the set of states with positive wigner function .",
    "in addition , this extension permits us to show explicitly how the gaussian states smoothly become extremal pure states in the context of uncertainty and positivity of wigner s functions .    in sec .",
    "[ seci ] , we introduce the quantities which we choose to characterize one - dimensional mixed states and shortly review the already acquired results concerning uncertainty relations . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] we derive new bound on the uncertainty of a mixed state characterized by its purity and non - gaussianity .",
    "we name this relation the _ non - gaussianity bounded uncertainty relation_. in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] we identify numerically the parts of the bound realized by states with positive wigner function , thus visualizing the overlap of the set of states with positive wigner function and the states minimizing the non - gaussianity bounded uncertainty relation .    in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have extended the entropy - bounded uncertainty relation using similar methods as we use here . however , that extension , as well as , the entropy - bounded uncertainty relation itself requires numerical methods to be expressed in a proper form . in sec.[seciv ] , we discuss the main outcomes of this work and we compare them with those in @xcite .",
    "for our purposes we need first to choose a convenient parametrization of the space of mixed states that will permit us to formulate the extensions of the uncertainty relation and hudson s theorem in a unified manner .",
    "let us start with a general density matrix @xmath0 determining a quantum state .",
    "apparently a measure of the degree of mixedeness of the state is an indispensable parameter characterizing a mixed state .",
    "we choose as the most convenient measure for us , the _ purity _ @xmath1 .",
    "the second basic characteristic of the state @xmath0 is its _ covariance matrix _",
    "@xmath2  defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the vector of the canonically conjugated observables position and momentum ( or quadrature operators in quantum optics ) @xmath5 , @xmath6@xmath7 is the displacement vector , and @xmath8 is the anticommutator .",
    "we can put the displacement vector to zero with no loss of generality since the purity ( as well as the quantities we will be interested in ) is invariant with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "the importance of the covariance matrix stems from the fact that it is measurable experimentally and that it is tightly connected , as we show below , to the uncertainty relation . throughout the text we will consider quantum systems with only one pair of conjugate variables , like the system of one particle or one - mode state in quantum optics",
    ", therefore we consider @xmath10 covariance matrices .",
    "the covariance matrix of @xmath0 uniquely determines a gaussian state @xmath11 which henceforth we will refer to  as the _ reference gaussian state _ for the state @xmath0 and we choose as second parameter the purity of @xmath11 , @xmath12    as a third parameter we introduce a measure of the _ non - gaussianity _ ,",
    "i.e. , the distance of the state from its reference gaussian state .",
    "at the first step we are going to work with the trace overlap @xmath13 between the states @xmath0 and @xmath11 .",
    "although the trace overlap is not a measure of distance , it can be employed together with @xmath14 , @xmath15 for evaluating a correct measure of non - gaussianity , the normalized hilbert - schmidt distance @xcite,@xcite , @xmath16    therefore , while a state @xmath0 requires an infinite set of parameters to be fully described , it is enough for our purposes to work in the reduced parametric space @xmath17 , @xmath14 , @xmath18 . in @xcite",
    "we have used the same parametric space . there",
    "we have formulated an extension of hudson s theorem to mixed states by identifying an upper bound , though not tight , on the non - gaussianity @xmath19 for states with positive wigner function .",
    "this bound is represented by a surface in the space @xmath17 , @xmath14 , @xmath18 .",
    "let us we note that the existing purity - bounded uncertainty relation @xcite can be represented as a line - bound in the plane @xmath20 .",
    "before we justify this statement , we shortly review the historical evolution of the knowledge concerning uncertainty relations and for more details we address an interested reader to @xcite .",
    "for pure states of covariance matrix @xmath2 , the first uncertainty relation @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 ) was proposed by heisenberg @xcite  and proven in its more strict form , @xmath23 , by kennard @xcite in 1927 .",
    "this uncertainty relation is saturated by coherent states and squeezed states whose major and minor axis in the phase - space , are parallel to the @xmath24- and @xmath25-axis .",
    "few years later , the heisenberg uncertainty relation was generalized  by schrdinger and robertson , independently , to a relation valid for any set of non - commuting observables and which , in the case of @xmath26 , takes the form @xmath27 the scrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation accounts for the possible correlations between the coordinates and therefore is  saturated by all gaussian pure states .",
    "even though , the inequality eq .",
    "( [ scr ] ) is valid also for mixed states it can not be saturated by any mixed state .",
    "therefore , for the sets of states with purity less than one , this uncertainty relation is not tight .",
    "a tight uncertainty relation for mixed states is the purity - bounded uncertainty relation derived by dodonov and manko @xcite @xmath28 for mixed states the lower limit on the uncertainties depends on the purity of the state via  a monotonic function @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30 in view of eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) it is then evident that the purity - bounded uncertainty relation eq .",
    "( [ hei ] ) is equivalent to a bound given by a line in the @xmath31 plane .",
    "dodonov and manko have proven @xcite that this bound is realized by states with phase - independent and positive wigner functions and they have derived an exact but piecewise expression for the function @xmath29 in eq.([hei ] ) . in a",
    "we present an alternative , though parametric , expression for this line - bound whose construction permits for a generalization to the three dimensional parametric space .",
    "we also note here a quite unexpected fact visualized by the purity - bounded uncertainty relation . it is known that on one hand the pure states which saturate the scrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation for pure states are the gaussian states . on the other hand",
    "the gaussian mixed states ( thermal states ) maximize the von neumann entropy @xcite being , in a sense , maximally disordered  @xcite  given @xmath14 eq.([ga ] ) .",
    "however , contrary to our intuition , the purity - bounded uncertainty relation dictates that the mixed gaussian states are not the states which maximize the purity .    in the next section ,",
    "we extend the purity - bounded uncertainty relation by including into it the non - gaussianity @xmath32 of states@xmath33 for our derivation and in view of eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) it is convenient ( as we explain in more detail in sec.[secii ] ) to conceive the inequality given by eq.([rel ] ) as a bound in the introduced parametric space @xmath34 .",
    "this bound  valid for all mixed states is then compared , in sec.[seciii ] , with the bound for states with positive wigner functions .",
    "in order to find function @xmath35 in eq.([rel ] ) it is enough to find the bound for the whole set of mixed quantum states in the parametric space @xmath36 .",
    "it is obvious that such a bound will be a surface ( since the space is three - dimensional ) and if it is single - valued in the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath32 it would represent the function @xmath37 .",
    "our results show that the bound is in general single - valued , however there is some particular domain of @xmath38 . where the bound is double - valued .",
    "this problem does not emerge if one works with @xmath39 instead of @xmath19 ( see eq .",
    "( [ di ] ) ) .",
    "that is why we derive our results employing the trace overlap . with the help of eq .",
    "( [ di ] ) the results can be directly translated to the initial parametric space @xmath40 and we do so , mainly for the visualization of the results .    a possible way to proceed with the derivation of the bound is to search for the states which minimize or maximize the purity @xmath15 if the values of the other two parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath41 , are kept constant .",
    "we conceive then the total bound consisting of two regions , namely , the _ region i _ where the purity @xmath15 is minimized and the _ region ii _ where the purity is maximized given @xmath14 and @xmath39 . at the final step we recombine both regions and present the whole bound which we name _ non - gaussianity bounded uncertainty relation _ as the abbreviation of the more exact title _ non - gaussianity and purity bounded uncertainty relation_.      let us consider a general density matrix @xmath0 characterized by the purity @xmath14 of the reference gaussian state @xmath11 and the trace overlap between @xmath0 and @xmath11 , @xmath13 . by using symplectic transformations we can set the covariance matrix @xmath2 of @xmath0 into a symmetric form where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "symplectic transformations , such as squeezing and rotation , do not change the quantities of interest ( see ref.@xcite ) and therefore without loss of generality , we can assume that the reference gaussian state for @xmath0 , @xmath11 , is a thermal state .",
    "in the wigner representation @xmath44such a state , @xmath11 , is @xmath45 where @xmath14 is its purity defined in eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) .",
    "the next step is to prove the _ lemma _ stating that for a given state @xmath0 with these characteristics , there is always a state of the same characteristics possessing a phase - independent wigner function , that is of equal or lower purity than @xmath0 . to prove the lemma it is more convenient to work in the wigner phase - space representation . in the general case",
    ", quantum state @xmath0 possesses an angular - dependent wigner function @xmath46 and its purity can be expressed as @xmath47 the trace overlap between @xmath0 and @xmath11 is @xmath48 now let us construct a new state @xmath49 with phase - invariant wigner function @xmath50 ,  by phase - averaging the wigner function @xmath46 , @xmath51 the reference gaussian state for @xmath49 will be the same  as for @xmath0 , since phase - averaging can not affect the angular - independent wigner function eq.([wg ] ) .",
    "the trace overlap among the symmetrized state @xmath49 and @xmath11 will remain the same , as well .",
    "this is a straightforward result of substitution of the phase - independent wigner function given by eq .",
    "( [ ws ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ trww ] ) .",
    "however , the purity @xmath52 of the symmetrized state @xmath49 is constrained to be smaller than , or equal to , that of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , by applying the cauchy - schwarz inequality we have @xmath53 this concludes the proof of our lemma .    from this lemma",
    "is straightforward to deduce that the bound corresponding to the states of minimum purity is achieved by states with angular - independent wigner function and we proceed by applying the method of lagrange multipliers to identify these states .",
    "we note also here that this lemma is well in accordance with the result of dodonov and manko @xcite who have shown that for any given @xmath14 one can always choose a coordinate system where the states with angular - independent wigner functions minimize the purity @xmath15 .",
    "any state possessing an angular - independent wigner function can be expressed @xcite as a convex combination of the _ number _ ( fock ) states @xmath54 in order to identify the weights @xmath55 of the states which minimize the purity @xmath56 we apply the method of lagrange multipliers with the following constraints imposed on the solution ,    1 .   normalization @xmath57 2 .",

    "we replace the index @xmath63 in eq.([rhon ] ) by a continuous variable @xmath24 and introducing instead of @xmath55 the function @xmath64 the same ansatz is employed in appendix a to derive an alternative expression for the purity - bounded uncertainty relation eqs.([n1])-([n2 ] ) .",
    "one can see that the solution eq .",

    "(  [ f ] ) , but for brevity reasons we do not repeat the procedure .",
    "now , we are ready to determine the coefficients @xmath61 . for every positive integer value of @xmath77 ( including zero )",

    "after this , the last step is to substitute the derived expressions for @xmath61 into eqs.([purity ] ) and ( [ overlap ] ) and obtain parametric expressions for extremal @xmath86 and @xmath87 via @xmath14 and @xmath69 . in order to assure that @xmath77 is the same in all three equations , one has to require that the constrains @xmath88 and @xmath89 are satisfied .    the exact solution presented in the appendix b is rather cumbersome .",

    "one can see it is the lower limit of the more general bound derived here .",
    "the upper limit of the so far derived bound ( the upper solid line ) is the _ rank _",

    "the area between this line and the @xmath100 line remains _ not covered _ by the derived bound .    in the same figure ( fig.[ubound](b ) ) one can notice that solid lines form loops which are arranged in horizontal rows .",
    "these lines define the borders between different ranks @xmath102  of the solution in  eq.([maxmin ] ) .",
    "each horizontal row corresponds to a specific rank indicated in the figure .",
    "this classification of the solution according to the ranks is comparable with the results presented in @xcite .",
    "one can see also that the loops form columns .",
    "each column corresponds to different value of @xmath77 which is equal to the number @xmath63 of the number state indicated at the upper limit of the right border of the column .      in fig .",
    "[ ubound](b ) we have observed that the states which minimize the purity do not realize the whole wanted bound , meaning that _ not _ for all pairs of values of @xmath96 we have obtained a bound on @xmath39 .",
    "this fact is not surprising since the trial solution , composed by mixtures of number states , can achieve purity @xmath100 , only for the number states .",
    "the rest of the bound which we call _ region ii , _ must be realized by states which maximize the purity , if @xmath14 and @xmath41 are given .    in order to obtain these states",
    "we apply first the lagrange multipliers method for a _ generic _ density matrix @xmath0 .",
    "thus we obtain the extremum , i.e. minimum or maximum value of the purity for a state @xmath0 with given @xmath14 and @xmath103 .",
    "in addition we require , without loss of generality , that covariance matrix of @xmath0 is symmetric in @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we express these constrains on the solution in the following way ,    1 .",

    "the solution to this extremization problem is of the form @xmath110 however the conditions given by eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) dictate that @xmath111 and therefore that the solution must be diagonal in the eigenbasis of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "in other words , the extremization problem on a generic density matrix is reduced to the problem we have solved in the sec .",
    "[ secii]a and it provides the _ region i _ of the bound .",
    "therefore , the method of lagrange multipliers does not add anything new and in order to find the states in the _ region ii _ maximizing purity we have to consider a possibility of the existence of a degenerate ( invariant ) subspace of solutions .",
    "let us now proceed in a different way and try to process the extremization problem in a modified way to reveal the degeneracy . instead of working with the mixing coefficients of the density matrix , we consider them fixed and we make variation on the wavevectors , a mixed state can be decomposed on .    to clarify the procedure we start with the special case of pure states where @xmath112 and @xmath113 in an eigenbasis which for convenience we choose to be the one of the quantum harmonic oscillator .",

    "this fact led us to the conclusion that the identified _ rank _ @xmath98 density matrices , eqs.([mixed12])-([assy ] ) are the extreme solutions which realize the _ region ii _ of the bound .    in fig .",
    "[ mixed ] , in analogy with the fig.[ubound ] ( b ) , we present how the _ region ii _ of the bound , projected on the plane @xmath203 , is separated to three different parts , realized by the states @xmath183 , @xmath204 eq.([mixed12 ] ) and  @xmath186 eq.([assy ] ) respectively .      the states which minimize the purity ( _ region i _ ) together with the states which maximize the purity ( _ region ii _ ) form a surface which bounds from below all the mixed states in the parametric space @xmath205 or equivalently bounds from above in the space @xmath206 . in fig .",
    "[ tbound ] we present the total bound that we name _ the non - gaussianity bounded uncertainty relation_. clearly the minimal uncertainty , @xmath207 , depends on the degree of non - gaussianity of a state . although the dependence is smooth  for the low - purity region ( up to purity @xmath208 ) the structure of the bound becomes more complex for higher values of purity and for some very small regions the bound projected on the plane @xmath209 is double valued .",
    "for these areas clearly the function @xmath210 in eq.([rel ] ) can not be defined .",
    "this problem does not appear when one uses the quantity @xmath13 instead .",
    "according to the arguments in @xcite the hudson s theorem for mixed states can be formulated as an upper bound on the non - gaussianity for the states with a positive wigner function .",
    "the idea behind this formulation is that since among the pure states only the gaussian states can possess a positive wigner function , for mixed states  one expects that the maximum degree of non - gaussianity of a state with a positive wigner function is lower than that of a generic state . in practice , this bound can be utilized as a set of experimentally verifiable , necessary conditions for a state to  have a positive wigner function or alternatively , as a set of sufficient conditions for a state to posses a non - positive wigner function .",
    "such conditions can be essential in the construction of non - classical  states which are useful resources in protocols of quantum information @xcite .    even though it is not trivial to identify the whole bound in the space @xmath40 for states with non - negative wigner functions",
    ", we can conclude using the same arguments as in sec .",
    "[ secii]a that the purity of the states with non - negative wigner function for given @xmath14 and @xmath39 is minimized by mixtures of number states . to our knowledge",
    "there is no necessary and sufficient condition that one can impose on the coefficients of a mixture of number states to guarantee positivity of the wigner function .",
    "due to this difficulty we can not proceed with further analytical identification of the states which realize the hudson s theorem for mixed states .    on the other hand from the results in sec .",
    "[ secii ] we can numerically obtain some information about the hudson s theorem for mixed states . to do so , in the bound fig.[tbound ] for all states",
    "we identify numerically the part realized by states with positive wigner function .",
    "we depict this common area , where the bounds for all states and for states with strictly positive wigner function are overlapping , as a shaded region in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "in @xcite we have gone one step further and we have identified numerically the whole _",
    "region i _ of the bound for the states with positive wigner function .",
    "we have concluded that the  two bounds stay very close when the purity of the state is low ( for a fixed uncertainty ) and we obtained an indication that the distance between the two bounds is increasing with purity .",
    "in addition in @xcite  the lowest degree of @xmath39 that a state with strictly positive wigner function may achieve for a given uncertainty , has been identified .",
    "inspired by the discussion in @xcite  and some recent results on the extension of hudson s theorem for mixed states @xcite , we have extended the purity - bounded uncertainty relation , adding one more parameter , namely , the degree of non - gaussianity . according to the results presented here , the minimal uncertainty for quantum states strongly depends not only on the degree of mixedeness but also on its non - gaussian character .",
    "the set of states which saturate this uncertainty relation includes the gaussian states . from this",
    "we can conclude that even though gaussianity is not a requirement for the minimization of this uncertainty relation , gaussian states are still included in the set of minimizing states and they dominate as purity tends to one .",
    "interestingly , the non - gaussianity bounded uncertainty relation is valid for pure states and there it is saturated , among others , by all eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator which appear as extremal points of the bound .    moreover , by identifying the states which possess a positive wigner function among the ones which saturate the non - gaussianity bounded uncertainty relation , we come closer to the extension of hudson s theorem for mixed states .",
    "gaussian mixed states ( thermal states ) both saturate the non - gaussianity uncertainty relation and satisfy the extended hudson s theorem .",
    "we should note that in @xcite we employ numerical methods to compliment the results presented here concerning the hudson s theorem .",
    "the main result in @xcite is the identification of the minimum degree of trace overlap that a mixed state of fixed uncertainty may achieve .    in this work",
    "we have chosen purity as a measure of the degree of mixedeness of the state .",
    "if the von neumann entropy is employed instead @xcite , then the results are similar to the one presented in this work and one arrives to the non - gaussianity extension of the entropy - bounded  uncertainty relation suggested by bastiaans @xcite .",
    "the advantage in using the entropy , is that the solution is automatically a positive matrix and one does not need to employ the ansatz we have used in the current work , to impose positivity ( eq.([f ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore , the solution to the extremization problem contains two branches , one bounding the trace overlap from above and one from below for fixed uncertainty and purity .",
    "note than in the current work we derive only the lower bound on the quantity of trace overlap . on the other hand ,",
    "the states which minimize the extended uncertainty relation in @xcite  are mixtures of all number states with @xmath211 ,  the solution can not be expressed in a closed form and one needs the help of numerical methods to visualize the results .",

    "( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c5 ] ) , and express @xmath82and @xmath83 in terms of @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "then we substitute the result into the eqs.([c2]),([c3 ] ) and we obtain a parametric relation for the extremal solution provided by the lagrange multiplier s method , @xmath222 where @xmath221 and @xmath223 .  we note that  by setting @xmath224 one can arrive to an approximate formula @xmath225 that reproduces the curve of eqs.([n1])-([n2 ] ) in very good approximation when @xmath226 .  for the rest of the region , @xmath227 , one should better employ the exact solution @xmath228    the obtained results eqs.([n1])-([n2 ] ) give the lower bound ( see fig.1(a ) ) on the plane @xmath14 and @xmath15 and are equivalent to the expressions derived in @xcite .",
