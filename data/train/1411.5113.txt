    "over the last decade , there has been much attention in investigating the nonlinear electrostatic and electromagnetic structures in quantum plasmas .",
    "the latter were first studied by pines @xcite in regimes of high - densities and low - temperatures as compared to classical plasmas . in these regimes of quantum plasmas ,",
    "the thermal de broglie wavelength of the charge carriers becomes comparable to the dimension of the system , and so the quantum statistical ( fermi - dirac pressure ) as well as mechanical ( such as tunneling associated with the bohm potential ) effects must be taken into account in the description of dynamics of charged particles such as electrons , positrons or holes .",
    "recently , the field of quantum plasmas , where the dominated wave nature of electrons gives rise to collective effects , has become an intense field of investigation , having applications in microelectronics @xcite , quantum dots and quantum wires @xcite , quantum wells , carbon nanotubes and quantum diodes @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite , as well as , in laser plasma experiments @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum plasmas are of great importance in dense astrophysical environments such as those in white dwarf stars and magnetars @xcite etc .",
    "moreover , it has recently been experimentally shown that quantum effects are important in inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) plasmas @xcite .",
    "there has also been a great majority of recent activities in the field of quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) and quantum magnetohydrodynamics ( qmhd ) @xcite , which highlight the unexpected nonlinear wave features in quantum plasmas .",
    "the qhd model generalizes the fluid model with the inclusion of quantum statistical pressure and quantum diffraction ( associated with the bohm potential ) terms .",
    "the validity of qhd model is limited to those systems that are large compared to the fermi debye lengths of the species in the system .",
    "investigations on electrostatic nonlinear waves , especially , solitary waves and shocks ( sws ) in plasmas have attracted more attention because of their vital roles in research in space , earth , as well as , in laboratory environments @xcite .",
    "nonlinear structures such as sws in plasmas have been observed in the laboratory , and also in condensed matter plasmas @xcite and colloidal suspension @xcite .",
    "when a medium has both dispersive and dissipative properties , the nonlinear propagation of electrostatic waves is governed by a korteweg - de vries burgers ( kdvb ) equation in one dimension and by a kadomtsev petviashvili burgers ( kpb ) equation in two - dimensional space .",
    "the dissipative burgers term in both the nonlinear kdvb and kpb equations arises due to , e. g. , the effect of kinematic viscosity among the plasma constituents .",
    "however , when the dissipation overwhelms the dispersion , and when the dissipative effect is in balance with the nonlinearity , we indeed have the possibility of shock waves . in the absence of dissipation ( or",
    "if the dissipation is weak at the characteristic dynamical time scales of the system ) , the balance between nonlinear and dispersive effects can result into the formation of solitons .",
    "a number of theoretical investigations have been carried out for understanding the collective processes as well as the formation of nonlinear coherent structures not only in classical plasmas ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but also in dense quantum plasmas @xcite . for example , mahmood _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the ion - acoustic ( ia ) solitary waves in quantum electron - ion ( e - i ) plasmas by employing sagdeev potential approach .",
    "masood @xcite studied the linear and nonlinear propagation of obliquely propagating magnetoacoustic waves in a dissipative quantum e - i magnetoplasma using a qmhd model .",
    "recently , akhtar and hussain @xcite investigated quantum ia shock waves in a negative ion quantum plasma on the basis of a qhd model .",
    "more recently , the behavior of quantum dust ion - acoustic ( dia ) shocks in a plasma including inertialess quantum electrons and positrons , classical cold ions and stationary negative dust grains are investigated by rouhani _ et al .",
    "however , all these investigations are limited to one - dimensional ( 1d ) planar geometry which may not be a realistic situation in laboratory devices , since the waves observed in laboratories are certainly not bounded in one - dimension .",
    "the purpose of this present work is to study the nonlinear propagation of ia solitary and shock waves in dissipative quantum e - i plasma in a two - dimensional planar geometry .",
    "both the small- and large amplitude electrostatic perturbations are considered .",
    "we show that these perturbations can develop into compressive or rarefactive sws depending on whether the dispersive effects caused by the density correlation due to quantum fluctuations as well as by the charge separation of particles ( deviation from quasineutrality ) is stronger or weaker than the effects of dissipation associated with the ion kinematic viscosity .",
    "we consider the nonlinear propagation of ion - acoustic solitary waves and shocks in a quantum plasma consisting of degenerate electrons providing all the pressure ( restoring force ) but none of the mass ( inertialess ) and positively charged inertial ions providing almost all the mass and none of the pressure .",
    "any speed involved in the plasma flow is assumed to be much lower than the quantum ion - acoustic ( qia ) speed . at equilibrium ,",
    "both electrons and ions have equal number density , say @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in a collisionless and unmagnetized quantum plasma the basic set of quantum hydrodynamic equations are @xcite @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    which can be written in nondimensional form in two space dimensions as @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12@xmath13here , @xmath14 is the total derivative , @xmath15 is the laplace operator , @xmath16 is the electron ( ion ) number density normalized by @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the ion velocity normalized by the qia speed @xmath19 with @xmath20 denoting the boltzmann constant , @xmath21 the ion mass , @xmath22 the electron fermi temperature and @xmath23 the reduced planck s constant . also , @xmath24 is the constant coefficient of the dynamical ( shear ) viscosity such that @xmath25 is that of the ion kinematic viscosity and @xmath26 is the nondimensional viscosity parameter which typically depends on the number density @xmath4 . also , @xmath27 is the ratio of the ` plasmon energy density ' to the fermi thermal energy in which @xmath28 is the plasma oscillation frequency for the @xmath29-th species particle .",
    "furthermore , @xmath30 is the electrostatic potential normalized by @xmath31 .",
    "the space and time variables are , respectively , normalized by the debye length @xmath32 and the ion plasma period @xmath33 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "is obtained after integrating the momentum balance equation for degenerate electrons and using the boundary conditions : @xmath34 as @xmath35 . in this equation",
    "we have considered the pressure gradient as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is pressure given by the following equation of state for nonrelativistic degenerate electrons @xcite @xmath38where @xmath39 is the fermi thermal speed of electrons .",
    "furthermore , the term proportional to @xmath3 in eq . appears due to the quantum force @xmath40 associated with the bohm potential ( tunneling effect ) given by @xmath41 now , in the small - amplitude limit , fourier analyzing the linearized basic equations - we obtain the following dispersion law for qia waves @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the wave frequency and wave number of perturbations ( oscillations ) , and @xmath45 .",
    "equation shows that the dispersion curves get modified by the effects of the quantum parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the wave becomes unstable due to the finite effect of the ion viscosity @xmath46 .",
    "however , in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath47 ) and in absence of the viscosity effect , the phase speed of the wave becomes @xmath48 , i.e. , constant .",
    "in other words , qia waves become dispersionless when the system length scale is much larger than the fermi debye length @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that in a frame moving with the speed @xmath50 , the time derivatives of all physical quantities should vanish .",
    "thus , for a finite @xmath51 with @xmath52 , one can observe slow variations of the wave amplitude in the moving frame of reference .",
    "so , we introduce the new variables for the space and the time as @xcite @xmath53where the phase speed @xmath50 ( normalized by @xmath54 ) equals @xmath55 .",
    "the dynamical variables are expanded as @xcite @xmath56 where we have considered the perturbations for the transverse velocity component @xmath57 as higher - order effects , i.e. , weaker than those of the longitudinal component @xmath58 .",
    "this is due to the fact that since the wave propagation is assumed to propagate along the @xmath59-axis or @xmath60 direction in the moving frame of reference , the effects of dispersion due to separation of electron and ion charges and the quantum tunneling associated with the bohm potential on qia waves will appear only in the @xmath60 direction , i.e. , along the direction of the ion velocity component @xmath58 .",
    "we also assume that the effect of the viscosity is small and the constant @xmath46 is the same for both the velocity components @xmath58 and @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is of the order of unity .",
    "next , we substitute the expansions from eq . into the basic nondimensional equations - and equate the terms in different powers of @xmath51 . in the lowest - order of @xmath51 , we obtain the following expressions for the first - order quantities @xmath63 together with @xmath64 , already considered in the stretching . from the next order of @xmath65 , we obtain the following equations @xmath66",
    "@xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 finally , eliminating the second - order quantities from eqs . - , and substituting the expressions for the first - order quantities from eq . into the resulting equation ,",
    "we obtain the following kpb equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the nonlinear coefficient , which appears due to finite - amplitude effects of first - order perturbed quantities normalized by their equilibrium values and @xmath73 is the coefficient of dispersion arising due to the deviation from quasineutrality and the quantum tunneling effects .",
    "furthermore , the dissipative coefficient @xmath74 appears due to the ion viscosity and @xmath75 is the effect of weak transverse perturbations ( i.e. , along the @xmath76-axis ) .",
    "equation describes the evolution of small - amplitude ion - acoustic sws in quantum plasmas .",
    "here , we obtain an analytic solution of eq . of the form @xmath77 , where @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 denoting , respectively , the nondimensional constant wave number ( for simplicity , we have considered @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the constants along @xmath60 and @xmath76 directions , as equal to @xmath79 ) and wave frequency . under this transformation eq . reduces to an ordinary differential equation with respect to @xmath83 , which can be solved by tanh method .",
    "there are several methods , e.g. , inverse scattering method , using bcklund transformation etc .",
    ", however , the most convenient and efficient method is the tanh method @xcite . by this method , a solution of eq",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath84 , \\label{shock - sol - kpb}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , in absence of the weak transverse perturbation , i.e. , perturbation along the @xmath76 direction , the kpb equation reduces to the korteweg - de vries burger ( kdvb ) equation @xmath88 which has the following shock solution ( by tanh method ) @xmath89 , \\label{shock1-sol - kdvb}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "that is , the wave speed of the kdvb shocks gets reduced , while the shock height remains unchanged .",
    "the other form of shock solution of eq . can also be obtained as @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are arbitrary constants .",
    "it can be shown that the profiles given by eq .",
    "will exhibit monotonic nature with increasing values of @xmath95 @xcite or decreasing values of @xmath3 .",
    "we also note that the two shock ( travelling wave ) solutions and are obtained in two different methods , however , their qualitative features will remain the same . on the other hand , disregarding the viscosity effect in eq .",
    ", one can also recover the kp equation @xmath96 which admits the following soliton solution ( by the tanh method ) @xcite @xmath97 , \\label{soliton - sol - kp}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , if we ignore the perturbation along @xmath76 direction @xmath100 as well as the dissipation @xmath101 , eq .",
    "reduces to the usual kdv equation with the following soliton solution @xmath102 .",
    "\\label{soliton - sol - kdv}\\ ] ]      in order to study the stability of a travelling wave solution of eq .",
    "we apply the technique as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the frame @xmath103 with @xmath98 , eq .",
    "reduces to an ordinary differential equation .",
    "the latter is then integrated twice with respect to @xmath83 , subject to the boundary conditions , namely @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 as @xmath107 , to yield @xmath108 in the @xmath109 plane , eq . ( [ stab ] ) has two singular points @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "while the former corresponds to the equilibrium downstream state , the latter corresponds to the upstream one .",
    "furthermore , the singular point @xmath110 is always a saddle point .",
    "the nature of the second one can be determined from the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the form @xmath112 @xcite of the linearized form of eq .",
    "( [ stab ] ) with @xmath113 , given by @xmath114.\\ ] ] it follows that the singular point @xmath115 is a stable focus or stable node according as @xmath116 .",
    "while the stable focus always corresponds to the oscillatory nature , the stable node corresponds to the monotonic nature of the solution .",
    "we numerically analyze the exact analytic solutions of eq . .",
    "we note that the parameters involved explicitly in the system are mainly @xmath3 and @xmath46 .",
    "they , respectively , appear in the coefficients of dispersion and dissipation .",
    "we note that since @xmath117 , lower values of @xmath118 corresponds to high - density plasma regimes .",
    "the values of @xmath119 is inadmissible , because otherwise the nonrelativistic @xmath120 quantum hydrodynamic model may not be valid @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it follows that quantum ion - acoustic shocks [ eqs .",
    ", ] can be either compressive or raraefactive according to when @xmath0 , i.e. , when one considers plasmas with the number density satisfying @xmath1 @xmath2 and the corresponding ion viscosity parameter satisfying @xmath121kg / ms for some choice of values of @xmath51 and @xmath95 below the unity . typically , in the interiors of compact astrophysical objects such as white dwarfs @xcite",
    ", the particle number density can vary in the range @xmath122 @xmath2 and the thermodynamic temperature @xmath123 k. also , the interiors of these stars may be considered as a plasma ( e.g. , carbon  oxygen white dwarf in a thermonuclear supernova explosion ) consisting of positively charged ions ( nuclei ) providing almost all the mass ( inertia ) and none of the pressure , as well as degenerate electrons providing all the pressure .",
    "now , in the solutions and , the factor @xmath124 mainly determines the steepness of the shocks .",
    "it is also clear that the nonlinear coefficient @xmath125 does not affect the shock steepness , and the dispersion coefficient @xmath126 affects neither the shock height nor its steepness , it only plays a role in shifting the shock from its initial position with a passage of time .",
    "typical profiles of the shock solution are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] and [ fig : figure2 ] with the variations of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath46 . evidently , the compressive [ fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](a ) ] and rarefactive shocks [ fig .",

    "we here note that lower the values of @xmath3 in @xmath129 , the higher is the particle number density .",
    "thus , in quantum plasmas , e.g. , in the interior of white dwarfs , the formation of compressive qia shocks is possible in the higher density regime with @xmath130 @xmath2 , whereas qia shocks of the rarefactive type may occur in relatively a lower density regime with @xmath131 @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding viscosity parameter @xmath132 range from @xmath133 kg / ms for compressive shocks and @xmath134 kg / ms for rarefactive shocks ( with @xmath135 ) .",
    "it is also found that while the magnitude of the height and strength increase for the compressive shocks , the same decrease for the raraefactive ones as the value of the quantum parameter @xmath3 gets increased .",
    "this is due to the fact that as @xmath3 increases in the regime @xmath127 , the magnitude of the dispersive coefficient @xmath136 decreases [ hence from eq .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath137 increases ] , whereas the same increases in @xmath128 [ i.e. , from eq .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath137 decreases ] .",
    "in other words , for compressive shocks , as long as the ratio of electron plasmon energy to the fermi thermal energy decreases and hence the corresponding dispersive effect is still weaker than the dissipation due to ion viscosity , the shock strength and height increase .",
    "for rarefactive shocks as @xmath3 increases , i.e. , the dispersive effects become higher than the dissipation , the magnitude of the shock strength and height decrease .     and @xmath95 for a fixed @xmath138 .",
    "the shock is of the compressive type and monotonic in nature.,width=288,height=192 ]    the effects of the ion viscosity on the profiles of the compressive shocks ( similar effects on the rarefactive shocks as well ) are shown in fig .",

    "physically , increasing the ion viscosity is equivalent to increasing the dissipation in the system , and hence an increase in the shock strength .",
    "figure [ fig : figure3 ] exhibits the effects of the quantum parameter @xmath3 on the profiles of both compressive [ subplot ( a ) ] and rarefactive [ subplot ( b ) ] kp solitons [ eq . ] .",
    "it is found that while the amplitude of the compressive soliton decreases with an increase in @xmath3 , the absolute value of the same for the rarefactive soliton gets enhanced with increasing values of @xmath3 .    a numerical shock solution of eq .",
    "is also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] for a fixed @xmath145 ( i.e. , @xmath146 @xmath2 ) and for different values of @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which , respectively , correspond to the values @xmath149 kg / ms , @xmath150 kg / ms , @xmath151 kg / ms , and @xmath152 kg / ms for a scaling parameter @xmath144 , i.e. , almost the same values of @xmath95 .",
    "it basically exhibits how a shock profile transits from oscillatory to monotonic one with increasing values of the viscosity parameter @xmath24 .",
    "we find that when @xmath95 or @xmath24 is very small , the shock wave admits an oscillatory profile . in this case",
    ", a train of solitons behind the shock is seen to form whenever the dispersion dominates over the dissipation ( see the profile at @xmath153 ) .",
    "however , when the dissipation overwhelms the dispersion and when the dissipative effect ( @xmath24 ) is in nice balance with the nonlinearity arising from the nonlinear mode coupling of finite amplitude qia waves , the shock wave will have a monotonic behavior ( see the profile at @xmath154 ) .",
    "so far we have investigated the evolution and properties of small - amplitude qia solitary waves and shocks in quantum plasmas . however , when the amplitude of the wave becomes larger the perturbation technique may no longer be valid , and one has to rely on some other method ( see , e.g. ref .",

    "the number of solitons gets reduced , and eventually at a large value of @xmath46 , a transition to monotonic shocks occurs ( see the profile at @xmath170 ) . on the other hand , fig .",

    "it is observed that the large amplitude qia shocks preserve its monotonicity as long as the dissipation parameter is dominant over the dispersion one .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the nonlinear propagation of ion - acoustic solitary waves and shocks in an electron - ion quantum plasma with the effects of ion kinematic viscosity as well as the density correlation due to quantum fluctuation ( quantum force associated with the bohm potential ) . while the former plays a dissipative role , and thus favors the formation of shcoks , the latter provides the dispersion , thereby favoring the formation of ion - acoustic solitons in quantum plasmas .",

    "<S> it is shown that the kpb equation can admit either compressive or rarefactive sws according to when @xmath0 , or the particle number density satisfies @xmath1 @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ratio of the electron plasmon energy to the fermi energy densities . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the properties of large - amplitude stationary shocks are studied numerically in the case when the wave dispersion due to charge separation is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that a transition from monotonic to oscillatory shocks occurs by the effects of the quantum parameter @xmath3 . </S>"
