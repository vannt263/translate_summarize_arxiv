    "our main question is how the rate of the collective decoherence of the correlated spin cluster , measured by the technique given in the previous section , differs from the one for the single spin dynamics ( [ single ] ) .",

    "is caused not by external bath but due to integral dipole - dipole interaction between spins . however , as we show below the resulting behavior of the system can be interpreted with the help of results obtained in the previous subsection .",
    "the dipole - dipole hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) commutes with zeeman hamiltonian @xmath63 however , the complexity of the system and especially the fact that two terms @xmath64 and @xmath65 do not commute makes impossible to find the exact ( analytical or numerical ) solution of the problem  @xcite .",
    "existence of high order coherences in the state described by prepared density operator @xmath18 also complicates the application of the traditional method of moments which enables to describe the decay of coherence without solving explicitly for eigenvalues and eigenstates of energy in case of single - quantum nmr experiments @xcite .",

    "in fact , the interaction described by hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) can be semiclassically interpreted as the perturbing magnetic field at the site of each spin ( parallel or antiparallel to the strong external magnetic field ) produced by all other spins in a cluster .",
