    "it is sometimes stated@xcite that all materials in their lowest - energy states are perfect crystals , i.e.  that matter at zero temperature is characterized by periodic order of the atoms .",
    "if this is true , it follows that disorder persisting to low temperatures , in amorphous solids for example , must be interpreted as a result of trapping of the system in a metastable state .",
    "another consequence is that the third law of thermodynamics holds in the planck form,@xcite which states that the entropy density tends to zero as the temperature @xmath6 .",
    "these statements , however plausible,@xcite have not been proved .",
    "one might aim to prove that any physically reasonable microscopic hamiltonian describing a material has a unique ground state which is spatially periodic .",
    "more generally , one wishes to know the minimal conditions on the hamiltonian sufficient to guarantee a periodic ground state .",
    "both problems are unsolved in general , but some progress has been made , particularly for one - dimensional systems.@xcite radin and schulman@xcite showed that if attention is restricted to a one - dimensional system of interacting classical units ( ` spins ' ) , each of which can exist in a finite number @xmath7 of distinct states , with no interactions beyond a spatial range @xmath5 , then there exists a ground state which is periodic with period at most @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , if the ground state is nondegenerate then it has perfect periodic order .",
    "thus , in this class of model systems , disorder can occur only if the ground state is degenerate .",
    "this result can be strengthened by the observation that degenerate ground states occur only ` rarely ' , in the sense that they require fine - tuning of the system s parameters ( coupling constants ) to precise values.@xcite in other words , degeneracy occurs only on a set of measure zero in the space of hamiltonians . in the absence of accidental degeneracies , then , radin and schulman s result implies that the ground state of such a discrete classical system is always periodic .",
    "recently , however , canright and watson@xcite ( cw ) have shown that this picture must be modified if the system is constrained by an exact symmetry .",
    "the idea that symmetry can imply degeneracy is familiar . for the discrete classical chain , cw showed that , under suitable circumstances , the degeneracy arising from symmetry can result in a nonzero entropy density , throughout a finite volume of the space of coupling parameters . in this phase , termed a d - pair phase , almost all the ground state configurations are aperiodic .",
    "the d - pair phase is robust , in the sense that it is not sensitive to small perturbations in the coupling constants defining the hamiltonian , as long as these perturbations respect the symmetry and the restriction to interactions of range @xmath5 .",
    "it is also sufficiently robust to persist to finite temperatures .",
    "cw considered two symmetries in detail : spatial inversion ( @xmath9 ) , and spin inversion ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "they showed rigorously that , for @xmath10 symmetry , d - pair phases exist if and only if @xmath7 is odd , while for @xmath9 symmetry , they exist for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the ising ( @xmath13 ) case is exceptional in that d - pair phases occur with @xmath9 symmetry only for range @xmath14 .",
    "although the cw proof is constructive , in the sense that it provides a method for finding all possible d - pair configurations for given @xmath7 and @xmath5 , there are immediate open questions .",
    "the cw result establishes existence or nonexistence of d - pairs in each case , but gives no information on the characteristics of the region in the phase diagram ( the space of coupling parameters ) occupied by the d - pair phase , when it exists  except that it has finite volume .",
    "one would like to know the size and location of the d - pair region .",
    "the location is important , since d - pair phases are of little interest unless they occur in a physically reasonable part of the phase diagram .",
    "for example , consider a hamiltonian whose coupling constants increase with spatial separation , and then drop to zero beyond the cutoff range @xmath5 .",
    "we consider such a hamiltonian to be ` unphysical ' .",
    "conversely , if the d - pair region includes hamiltonians whose couplings decrease smoothly as a function of interaction range @xmath3 , reaching zero at @xmath4 ( or before ) , then we would claim that the case has been made that physically reasonable hamiltonians can give ground states violating the third law .",
    "in this paper we investigate these questions .",
    "after sec .",
    "[ graphs ] , which reviews the formalism used in the construction of d - pairs , we derive in sec .",
    "[ char ] results which characterize the geometry of the d - pair region in terms of the combinatorial properties of the corresponding graph cycles . in sec .",
    "[ dph ] , we provide a simple construction for writing down an explicit hamiltonian corresponding to any given d - pair .",
    "we prove that this hamiltonian has couplings which fall off approximately linearly with distance , which shows that it is indeed possible to have d - pair phases without pathological hamiltonians .",
    "the system of interest is composed of interacting classical units , forming an infinite one - dimensional chain .",
    "each ` spin ' @xmath15 can take @xmath7 distinct values , which we label @xmath16 .",
    "a general hamiltonian having interactions of maximum range @xmath5 can be written @xmath17 where the sum is over all sites .",
    "our interest is in ground states of @xmath18 , which are those configurations @xmath19 that minimize the energy density in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , @xmath20 with the number of sites @xmath21 . in particular , we seek ground states which do not require fine - tuning of coupling parameters to precise values ; hereafter we restrict the term ground state to mean minimum - energy states which are robust with respect to small changes in the hamiltonian .",
    "( a more precise definition in this context is given in ref .  .",
    ")    it is very useful to represent the hamiltonian pictorially as a directed graph @xmath22 with energy weights assigned to the arcs.@xcite the graph has @xmath8 nodes , each representing a possible sequence of @xmath5 spins in the system .",
    "the arcs in the graph correspond to the operation of spatial translation in the chain by one unit : a directed arc connects two nodes if the rightmost @xmath23 spins of one agree with the leftmost @xmath23 spins of the other .",
    "the arc pointing from the node @xmath24 to the node @xmath25 is assigned an energy weight @xmath26 .",
    "any spin configuration of the chain is represented by an infinite path in the graph , and its energy density equals the average weight of the arcs in the path : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is defined as the average occurrence of an arc @xmath29 in the path .",
    "thus , each spin configuration is characterized by its arc densities @xmath30 .",
    "the arc densities are not all independent , since they satisfy flow constraints@xcite which state that at each node the sums of incoming and outgoing arc densities are equal . in addition",
    ", they satisfy the inequalities @xmath31 .    in this language , the radin ",
    "schulman result is easily understood .",
    "any path in a graph may be decomposed into simple cycles@xcite ( scs ) , where a sc is a closed path not visiting any node more than once .",
    "if @xmath22 has a unique sc with lower energy per spin than any other , then the nondegenerate periodic ground state of @xmath18 is generated by repetition of that sc ; if there are two or more lowest - weight scs , then there is always a periodic ground state generated by repeating one of them . in either case ,",
    "the period of the periodic ground state is at most the number of nodes in @xmath22 , which is @xmath8 .    that these scs are true ground states , in our restricted sense of being stable to perturbations in the hamiltonian , is readily understood using the idea of the correlation polytope@xcite @xmath32 .",
    "the spin correlations are defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the sequence of integers @xmath35 ; there are @xmath36 independent spin correlations , given by the values @xmath37 with @xmath38 . to any configuration of the chain",
    "corresponds a @xmath1-dimensional vector @xmath39 of correlations , and any hamiltonian density can be written as a linear combination , @xmath40 , where the @xmath41 are the @xmath1 independent coupling parameters . however , the mapping from configuration to correlation vector is not one - to - one , and not all correlation vectors represent feasible configurations",
    ". specifically , the correlations and the arc densities are linearly related ( sec .",
    "[ dph ] ) , and the constraints @xmath31 on arc densities translate to inequalities on the correlation vector .",
    "they constrain @xmath39 to lie inside a convex polytope , and this is the correlation polytope @xmath32 .    because the hamiltonian is a linear function of the correlations , the ground states which are robust to small changes in couplings @xmath41 are precisely the vertices of @xmath32 . by a simple argument@xcite the vertices can be shown to be in one - to - one correspondence with the scs of @xmath22 , and we arrive at the result that the ground states are ` almost always ' periodic .",
    "one can enumerate all possible ground states by finding all scs of the graph .",
    "the argument just sketched does not apply when a symmetry @xmath42 is imposed , forcing symmetry - related arc weights to be equal .",
    "if the lowest - weight sc is not symmetry - invariant , there must be a pair of degenerate lowest - weight scs . if these do not share a node , there exist two symmetry - broken periodic ground states .",
    "if they share one or more nodes , the domain wall energy between them is zero , so that there are infinitely many degenerate ground state configurations , most of which are mixtures with a nonzero density of domain walls .",
    "the latter case is the d - pair phase , so called since it comes from a pair of symmetry - broken configurations , and is characterized by degeneracy ( infinitely many ground states , yielding a nonzero entropy density ) and disorder ( almost all the ground states have no long - range order ) .    a simple example@xcite illustrating the idea of a d - pair is the @xmath43 , @xmath44 model @xmath45 where the spins @xmath15 can take the values 0 and @xmath46 and the angular brackets denote an average over the chain .",
    "@xmath47 is invariant under spin inversion ( @xmath10 ) symmetry , @xmath48 .",
    "it is useful to transform to the variables @xmath49 , which take the values @xmath46 .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes , apart from irrelevant constants , @xmath50 , the ising antiferromagnet .",
    "its antiferromagnetic ground state , when transformed back to @xmath29 variables , is @xmath51 , where each @xmath52 spin can take any value independent of all the others .    the degeneracy and disorder in the ground state appears in this example as a trivial consequence of the double - valued transformation between @xmath53 and @xmath29 .",
    "what makes it special is the fact that _ these properties are stable to perturbations in the hamiltonian , _ provided these respect the symmetry and the restriction to range 2 interactions .",
    "this follows from two facts .",
    "( i ) the ground states are lower in energy density than any other ( periodic ) state by a discrete amount , so a sufficiently small perturbation can not create a new ground state .",
    "( ii ) the only allowed perturbation terms are those involving correlations already in @xmath47 , plus the additional correlation @xmath54 , and each of these takes the same value on all ground states , so the degeneracy is not split .",
    "this is the robustness characteristic of a d - pair .",
    "to study d - pairs for general @xmath7 and @xmath5 , cw introduced the concept of the reduced graph @xmath55 .",
    "not all symmetry - related pairs of scs of @xmath22 correspond to possible ground states in the presence of symmetry , because the equality of symmetry - related arc weights can imply the existence of a third sc with lower energy than the original pair .",
    "we refer to this situation as decomposition of a sc pair .",
    "the definitions of the symmetry - reduced graph @xmath55 and its scs are tailored to take care of decomposing scs , in such a way that the possible ground states are in one - to - one correspondence with scs of @xmath55 . for @xmath10 symmetry ,",
    "the reduced graph is constructed by identifying each node or arc with its inverse , and scs are defined as usual as paths which do not self - intersect . for @xmath9 symmetry ,",
    "the definition of the reduced graph and its scs is more involved ; we refer the reader to cw for the technical details , including the classification of scs into four topological types .",

    "first , let us discuss the problem unconstrained by symmetry .",
    "we ask , what is the region , @xmath0 , of @xmath57-space in which a given configuration ( i.e.  sc ) @xmath58 is the ground state ? in principle , it is a region bounded by hyperplanes corresponding to the inequalities @xmath59 , where @xmath60 ranges over all other scs . however , in general some of these inequalities are redundant .",
    "we wish to determine the minimal set of inequalities needed to specify @xmath0 fully .",

    "it follows from the convexity of @xmath32 that the set of vectors @xmath77 , @xmath73 , from @xmath67 to its neighbours spans the full @xmath1-dimensional space .",

    "conversely , if the scs have fewer than two contacts there is only one way to express points in density space on the segment joining them as a convex combination of scs , and so they correspond to neighbouring vertices .",
    "width5pt    we remark that the reasoning in lemma 2 is very similar to that leading to decomposition of pairs of scs ( except that in lemma 2 the scs need not be related by symmetry ) .",
    "this has a simple geometrical interpretation .",
    "a symmetry imposes linear constraints on the coupling parameters @xmath41 , which means that the relevant space of correlations is a reduced polytope @xmath105 obtained by symmetry projection of @xmath32 .",

    "lemma 2 also goes through unchanged in the case of @xmath10 symmetry , since the definition of scs for @xmath110 is the same as that for @xmath22 .",

    ", we find again that the dominant distance dependence of @xmath41 is a linear fall - off to zero beyond the cutoff range .",
    "the existence of d - pair phases is interesting from a theoretical point of view .",
    "however , we are not aware of any obvious candidate material for their realization in nature .",
    "we note that there is an entire class of materials , namely , layered solids or polytypes , which are well modelled by effective hamiltonians such as those studied here .",
    "this class of materials is however quite large ; and the few effective hamiltonians that are known from this class do not show promise of having a d - pair phase as the ground state .",
    "( see the discussion and references in ref .  .",
    ")    thus , there are significant obstacles to finding d - pairs in practice .",
    "however , the results of sec .  [ dph ] of this paper remove one potential obstacle : the possibility that the only hamiltonians exhibiting d - pair phases are pathological in the dependence of their coupling parameters on distance .",
    "we would like the couplings to decrease smoothly to zero at the cutoff range , otherwise it would seem unphysical to impose a rigid cutoff beyond which there are no interactions .",
    "we have constructed an explicit hamiltonian for arbitrary @xmath7 and @xmath5 , which has d - pair ground states .",
    "encouragingly , its couplings are very well behaved : as a function of distance , they fall linearly to zero at the cutoff .",
    "remaining obstacles concern the robustness of d - pair behaviour .",
    "although d - pairs are not destroyed by symmetric perturbations of sufficiently short range or by nonzero temperature , they are in general destroyed by including interactions beyond the cutoff .",
    "they are also destroyed by deviations from perfect symmetry caused , for example , by external fields  which may or may not be strictly zero , depending on the symmetry in question , and on the physical identity of the ` spins ' . however",
    ", even when the degeneracy is broken in such ways , behaviour characteristic of d - pairs may be observable at a suitable energy scale .",
    "if the perturbations breaking the d - pair symmetry are small , they are not manifest except at very small temperatures . at low but nonzero temperatures",
    ", one would still expect to observe disordered states and nonzero entropy density . in that case , the techniques of sec .",
    "[ char ] of this paper apply directly to the problem of characterizing the d - pair region .",
    "( possible experimental signatures of d - pairs have been investigated by yi and canright.@xcite )    another potential obstacle is the limitation to problems involving classical , discrete units .",
    "however , such models are likely to be good approximations for certain problems , such as stacking polytypes of crystals ( see cw and references therein ) where the ` spin ' represents the discrete set of possible configurations of a single lattice plane .",
    "another limitation is the restriction to one - dimensional models .",
    "the question of whether similar behaviour is possible in higher dimensions is unexplored , although certain frustrated two - dimensional models are known to have degenerate ground states of large periodicity.@xcite finally , although we have shown that d - pair phases are possible with hamiltonians that are not obviously unphysical , there may be more subtle physical reasons  arising , say , from quantum - mechanical considerations  which may argue against effective classical hamiltonians having d - pairs as ground states . for example , effective classical hamiltonians representing the binding energy of mobile electrons in an ionic background tend to favour periodic ionic arrangements.@xcite we leave these questions for future work .",
