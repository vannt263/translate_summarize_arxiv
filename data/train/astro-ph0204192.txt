    "although tremendous progress has been made in recent years in mapping the large - scale gravitational field ( out to scales of @xmath4 km s@xmath1 ) , relatively little data are available to study the velocity field of galaxies in the local neighborhood ( @xmath5 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the major impediment to constraining the local flow is the lack of a consistent set of distances to nearby galaxies .",
    "locally , the deviations from a pure hubble law have been predicted to be large and measurable , as much as 1 magnitude in distance modulus .",
    "if gravitational instability has generated all the large scale structure in the universe , then it must also be responsible for the extremely anisotropic local galaxy distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : skydist ] ) @xcite . under this assumption",
    ", it is possible to predict the velocity field from this distribution .",
    "the catalogs from such full  sky galaxy redshift surveys as the 1.2 jy iras survey @xcite allow us to estimate the large scale gravity field out to a redshift @xmath6 km s@xmath1 . in the limit of linear perturbations at late times , one expects the peculiar velocity at a point in space to be proportional to the gravity field at that point .",
    "[ figure : skydist ] demonstrates that according to linear theory , the local velocity field is expected to show substantial deviations from uniformity , with quadrupole distortions dominating .",
    "outflow is directed toward virgo and fornax on opposite sides of the sky , while substantial infall occurs from the poles of the local distribution .",
    "such a flow is expected within any gravitational model and would act to depopulate galaxies from the local poles .",
    "the bulk of the local galaxy distribution does reside on the positive and zero contours of figure  [ figure : skydist ] ( the local supercluster plane ) , while the regions of negative peculiar velocity are deficient but not entirely devoid of galaxies .",
    "it is possible that linear theory does not apply on this scale , but in that case one would expect a more chaotic flow of similar amplitude .",
    "observations of local deviations from hubble flow do not really support the expectations of fig .",
    "[ figure : skydist ] , especially in the southern direction ( see the review by @xcite ) .",
    "however , the data are sparse because large spiral galaxies suitable for tully - fisher or cepheid period  luminosity analysis are very rare locally , and the sky coverage , particularly in the expected infalling regions , is poor .",
    "we have thus set out to provide new distances to a complementary sample of nearby galaxies that were chosen to lie near the maximum predicted infall .",
    "according to stellar evolution theory , the tip of the first ",
    "ascent red  giant branch ( trgb ) marks the onset of the core ",
    "helium flash in low ",
    "mass stars .",
    "observationally , this phenomenon causes a distinct and abrupt termination of the bright end of the red  giant branch luminosity function .",
    "this discontinuity translates directly into an excellent distance indicator : the bolometric luminosity of the trgb for low  mass stars is predicted to vary by only @xmath7 mag for ages ranging from 2 up to 15 gyr @xcite and for metallicities encompassing the entire range represented by galactic globular clusters ( @xmath8 < -0.7 $ ] ) @xcite .",
    "the discontinuity is also found empirically to be stable at the @xmath7 mag level in the @xmath2 band for the same set of stellar properties .",
    "the trgb method has a strong empirical , as well as physical , basis .",
    "distances obtained using the trgb agree with the cepheid period ",
    "luminosity relation ( where direct comparisons have been made ) at a @xmath95% level , e.g. @xcite  an exception is for m33 : @xcite . furthermore , since all visible galaxies must have had a first generation of stars , the trgb method is applicable to populations in all morphological types , including spiral , elliptical , and even irregular galaxies , provided their metallicity is sufficiently low .",
    "the trgb method also requires far less telescope time for observations than cepheids since repeat visits are unnecessary , a considerable advantage . a good review of the trgb",
    ", its applications and theoretical underpinnings , is given in @xcite .",
    "we have used the tip of the red giant branch to obtain distances to a sample of local galaxies ( mostly dwarfs ) in order to derive their peculiar velocities . in   2 we discuss the observations we have made of several galaxies using both the w.m .",
    "keck observatory and the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) . in ",
    "3 we present the methods for measuring the trgb that we have employed and include detailed information on the analysis and error propogation . finally , in   4 we present the color",
    " magnitude diagrams , luminosity functions , and derived distances for several of the galaxies studied .",
    "we discuss the derived peculiar velocities and their implications in paper ii @xcite .",
    "to select targets for observation , we assembled an all - sky sample of 502 galaxies likely to be in the local volume ( cz @xmath10 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "this sample consists of all objects identified as galaxies ( type g ) with heliocentric radial velocities less than + 900 km s@xmath1 within the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we then transformed all velocities to the local group frame @xcite and selected those having radial velocities less than + 550 km s@xmath1 .",
    "their distribution on the sky ( in galactic coordinates ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : skydist ] .",
    "undoubtedly , many ( @xmath11 ) of these galaxies are not actually within the local neighborhood but are cluster members whose large peculiar velocities arising from virial motions bring them into our sample .",
    "this is clearly the case toward the virgo cluster ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "we are most interested in galaxies located in the regions of strong infall predicted by the flow models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have observed a subset of these galaxies with the keck telescope in hawaii and/or the _ hubble space telescope_.      we observed target galaxies on the nights of 1997 december 22 and 23 under photometric conditions using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) @xcite . at that time lris",
    "operated at the cassegrain focus of the 10-m keck ii telescope at the w.m .",
    "keck obseratory located on mauna kea , hawaii ( it now resides on keck i ) .",
    "the instrument includes a backside - illuminated tek @xmath14 ccd detetector with an imaging scale of 0.215 arcseconds / pixel and a field of view of @xmath15 arcminutes .",
    "we read out the ccd in the two - amplifier mode .",
    "each galaxy was observed through both johnson @xmath3 and cousins @xmath2 broadband filters . for the brightest ,",
    "best resolved galaxies we took one exposure in each filter , of typically 300 sec duration . for the fainter , less well  resolved galaxies we took between three and eight 250500 second exposures in @xmath2 and one to two 300800 second exposures in @xmath3 .",
    "see table  [ table : obs ] for details . over both nights",
    "four landolt standard star fields were observed @xcite in order to calibrate the photometry .",
    "the images were reduced according to standard procedures using software written in idl .",
    "the ccd frames were subtracted for bias level ( determined from the overscan region appropriate to that amplifier ) and dark current .",
    "the right side of each frame was scaled to match the left using the gain ( 1.97 @xmath16/count for the left amplifier , 2.1 @xmath16/count for the right ) and the respective bias levels . in @xmath2 sky flats",
    "were constructed using all of a single night s image frames themselves , while in @xmath3 dome flats were used to remove pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "the resulting image frames were found to be uniform in sensitivity across their widths to better than 1% .",
    "frames for individual galaxies were registered and combined through a median filter to remove cosmic rays and increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "these combined frames were used for finding stars .    due to geometric and optical distortions ,",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) varies as a function of position on the lris ccd chip .",
    "it was therefore necessary to compute an empirical psf for each image from a hand - selected list of @xmath17 bright , unsaturated stars that had no stellar neighbors within @xmath18fwhm .",
    "the psf for each data image was modeled using the daophot package within iraf .",
    "stars were identified and instrumental magnitudes were computed using the fortran versions of daophot ii / allframe @xcite .",
    "these programs , modified for fits",
    "i / o , were obtained from k. gebhardt at the university of california , santa cruz .",
    "several of the fainter targets were not well resolved into stars , and thus were not usable for determining trgb distances .",
    "thus , we did not perform full photometry on these objects .    the instrumental magnitudes @xmath19 and magnitude errors for each image in a filter were combined using a robust mean ( a weighted mean iteratively refined by a factor of @xmath20 for each weight , @xmath21 ) and converted to standard magnitudes @xmath22 with the equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the exposure time , ac is the aperture correction",
    ", x is the airmass for each observation , and c@xmath25 , c@xmath26 , c@xmath27 , and c@xmath28 are constants .",
    "the aperture correction , ac , was computed by comparing the magnitudes of bright isolated stars in each object found through an aperture of 40 pixels ( 8.6 arcsec ) in diameter to the magnitude found via psf fitting .",
    "values of the aperture corrections range from @xmath29 to @xmath30 mag , with standard errors of @xmath31 to @xmath32 mag .",
    "the broadband filters on lris are very close to the standard system , so the color terms , c@xmath27 and c@xmath28 , were found to be negligable .",
    "the extinction coefficients ( in magnitudes / airmass ) given by c@xmath26 are 0.12 at 550 nm and 0.07 at 800 nm @xcite .",
    "the magnitude zero point , c@xmath25 , was computed by using the above information and aperture photometry of both landolt standard stars and the additional stars in landolt fields recently calibrated to the standard system @xcite . the interactive iraf task _ fitparams _ in the * noao.digiphot.photcal *",
    "package was used to compute a non - linear least squares fit of the observed magnitudes to the calibrated magnitudes of these standards .",
    "the resulting zero points have an rms error of 0.02 mag in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we also obtained images of thirteen galaxies with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ between august 13 , 1999 and may 9 , 2000 ( program 8199 , pi m. davis ) .",
    "galaxies were observed in two exposures from 1200 - 1300s each in the f814w filter ; three objects were also observed with two 1200 - 1300s exposures in the f555w filter .",
    "table  [ table : obs ] details the wfpc2 observations .",
    "these thirteen galaxies were chosen specifically because they are located in regions of the sky where strong inflow is predicted by the iras data , especially around @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the calibrated and data  quality images were retrieved from the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) where preliminary ccd processing , including bias- and dark - subtraction , flat  fielding , and a shutter  shading correction , are automatically applied using calibration data closest to the time of the observation .",
    "details of these initial reductions are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for photometric measurements we used the psf - fitting package hstphot developed by a. dolphin specifically for analyzing hst / wfpc2 data .",
    "hstphot has been used recently in a number of stellar population studies @xcite .",
    "it has been optimized for the undersampled conditions present in wfpc2 data and works very well in crowded fields .",
    "hstphot is written in c and runs non - interactively from the command line . in our reductions , hstphot was an order of magnitude faster than allframe , and identified @xmath35 more stars .",
    "the algorithms used by hstphot most resemble those of dophot @xcite ; tests of hstphot photometry including a comparison with an independent dophot analysis are discussed in @xcite .",
    "our own limited tests of hstphot reliability as measured against allframe photometry showed no gross systematics , even at faint magnitudes .",
    "hstphot determines stellar magnitudes using a library of tiny tim psfs @xcite that have been built for all the commonly used wfpc2 filters .",
    "the psfs are modified internally for geometric distortions using the equations of @xcite , and corrected for the 34@xmath36 row error @xcite .",
    "the final stellar magnitudes are calibrated using the charge - transfer efficiency and zero - point corrections derived in @xcite .",
    "the data were analyzed using hstphot according to the following recipe : ( 1 ) mask bad pixels and columns using the data - quality image ; ( 2 ) reject cosmic rays ; ( 3 ) flag and mask hot pixels ; ( 4 ) generate a sky image ; ( 5 ) find stars and make photometric measurements ; and ( 6 ) determine and apply aperture corrections .",
    "the output from the _ multiphot _ procedure in hstphot was trimmed according to the following criteria to generate the final , calibrated star list : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "we augmented our sample of hst data by searching the wfpc2 archive for suitable nearby galaxies with observations in the f814w and f555w filters .",
    "the blue compact dwarf galaxy ugc  06456 was found to have a well defined trgb as discussed in more detail in ",
    "these data were reduced in the same way as described above .",
    "early estimates of the apparent magnitude of the trgb used a simple `` eyeball '' estimate of its location in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , e.g. @xcite . in the 1990s more quantitative methodologies",
    "were introduced @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we have used two distinct methods to quantitatively estimate the trgb magnitude from the shape of the luminosity function of a population of stars .    after the exhaustion of hydrogen fuel in the core of a star there is a rapid increase in the rate at which its luminosity will change with time . because this evolution is so quick , stars that appear above the main sequence turnoff point in the cmd",
    "must have had the same main sequence lifetime , and hence the same initial mass , to within a few percent .",
    "therefore , the luminosity function of a star cluster ( or single population of stars ) past the main sequence is primarily a reflection of the rate of luminosity evolution for those stars .",
    "see the review by @xcite for details in interpreting the luminosity functions of populations of evolved stars .",
    "low - mass , post - main - sequence stars develop an inert isothermal core supported by electron degeneracy pressure .",
    "the luminosity of these stars is almost entirely dependent on the mass of that core , because all of their energy generation occurs in a thin hydrogen burning shell surrounding the core .",
    "the temperature of the shell is set by the amount of potential energy converted to heat by the gravitational contraction of the core .",
    "once on the red giant branch ( the vertical track in the cmd ) the stars rate of luminosity evolution is primarily dependent on the rate of increase of the mass of the core .    due to the simple dependence of luminosity on core mass ,",
    "red giant branch luminosity functions are expected to be very simple and depend only very weakly on parameters such as age , metallicity , or mass of the envelope of the star .",
    "indeed theoretical and empirical studies find the bright end of red giant branch luminosity functions to have a simple power - law behavior ; i.e. , they are straight lines in the magnitude - log(counts ) plane @xcite .",
    "models all predict essentially the same power - law slope and are in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "the luminosity function of the red giant branch terminates at the trgb , the core mass at which the helium flash occurs , and the stars then adjust their structures rapidly and move to a new location in the cmd ( the horizontal branch of helium core  burning stars ) .",
    "the magnitude of the trgb is the location in the luminosity function where the red giant branch power  law truncates .",
    "brightward of that break are other populations of stars ( asymptotic giant branch and red supergiant stars mostly ) but they are rare and have a distinctly different luminosity function behavior .    from our data we have determined that if the red giant branch luminosity function power - law is given as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the apparent magnitude , then @xmath43 . this fixed slope can also be found in numerous other studies of red giant branch luminosity functions ( * ? ? ? * for example ) though that fact is rarely explicitly stated .",
    "the first trgb estimation method we have applied simply uses the fact that there will be a discontinuity in the luminosity function at the location of the trgb .",
    "the first derivative of the luminosity function should therefore show a large peak at the discontinuity .",
    "early applications often used histograms to approximate the luminosity function and a sobel edge  detection filter to estimate the first derivative @xcite , but this had the major drawback that the estimates could be strongly dependent on the histogram binning size . later",
    "* hereafter referred to as smf96 ) updated this method by employing a gaussian - smoothed luminosity function , @xmath44 , and a continuous edge ",
    "detection function @xmath45 where @xmath46 ( as defined by smf96 ) is the mean photometric error within a bin of @xmath47 mag about magnitude @xmath42 .",
    "we have used the method of smf96 , with some minor modifications , to estimate the trgb magnitude of our objects . due to the natural power  law form of the luminosity function we are most concerned with fractional changes .",
    "thus , we use a logarithmic edge ",
    "detection function , @xmath48 another modification to the smf96 method is the definition of @xmath46 used . for each galaxy",
    "observed we determine a polynomial fit to our data for the photometric flux errors as a function of flux .",
    "the function is then transformed to magnitude error as a function of magnitude . thus , we define @xmath46 as simply the photometric error given by the fit at magnitude @xmath42 .",
    "the region of the luminosity function brighter than the trgb is sparsely populated ( mostly by agb stars ) and thus very noisy ; the large first derivative noise spikes can make it difficult to robustly identify the trgb automatically .",
    "we thus weight the edge  detection response by the poisson noise in the smoothed luminosity function .",
    "even that fails to quiet some noise spikes and we are thus forced to limit this analysis to the region of the luminosity function that we know by inspection contains the trgb .",
    "see the figures in   4.3 for results of the edge  detection ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ figure : leoi_ccut_lf ] )      binning the data is not necessary , and we have employed a maximum likelihood analysis similar in spirit to the luminosity function analysis of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also references therein ) .",
    "define the luminosity distribution function of stars in the galaxy under investigation to be @xmath49 where @xmath42 is the apparent magnitude and * a * is the list of parameters defining the function .",
    "the probability @xmath50 that star @xmath51 has an observed magnitude @xmath52 within a range @xmath53 is then @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are lower and upper bounds for the validity of the parameterized distribution function .",
    "the likelihood @xmath57 that the observed distribution of stellar magnitudes is described by this function is simply the product of the individual probablities , since each star is drawn randomly from this distribution .",
    "it is most convenient to consider @xmath58 @xmath59 where the sum extends over all stars @xmath51 with @xmath60 stars in total .    for this analysis we use a simple , broken power - law model to describe the luminosity distribution function , but we also take into account the smoothing induced by measurement errors for the apparent luminosities .",
    "we use the form @xmath61 and define @xmath62 as    @xmath63    we fix @xmath64 but allow as free parameters the trgb magnitude @xmath65 , the slope of the luminosity function brighter than the trgb @xmath66 , and the strength of the discontinuity at the trgb , @xmath67 .",
    "the smoothing function @xmath68 is the same error function mentioned in ",
    "3.1.1 used to estimate @xmath46 .",
    "it is a function of the apparent magnitude but not of the parameters of the fit .",
    "our procedure is then to compute the likelihood function on a grid in the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 and to determine the point of maximum likelihood .",
    "the method used is self  normalizing ; the likelihood contours are quite peaked , with @xmath69 error widths in @xmath65 usually less than @xmath70 mag ( e.g. fig  [ figure : sextansb_halo_ccut_like ] ) . to test for covariance we marginalize the likelihood by computing @xmath71 covariance with the variables , @xmath66 , and @xmath67",
    "is found to be negligible , and the peaks in most of the marginalized likelihoods occur at the same magnitude as the peaks in the full likelihoods . in the cases reported in ",
    "4.3 there are no differences , and the largest difference in all cases is only @xmath72 mag",
    ". we fit gaussians to the marginalized likelihoods and find that the @xmath73 errors in @xmath65 are typically only a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "the best fitting @xmath74 curves for each galaxy are displayed in the figures of   4.3 .",
    "note that these fits are quite acceptable in each case .",
    "smoothing by the photometric errors converts the discontinuity in @xmath62 at @xmath75 into a continuous distribution @xmath74 .",
    "since the smoothing becomes larger for fainter magnitudes , the model automatically degrades the apparent slope of the trgb edge as a function of distance .",
    "the likelihood analysis works best if the red giant branch power ",
    "law is observed over a range of one magnitude or more . in cases in which we failed to detect the trgb",
    ", we seldom observed a power law slope for the red giant branch , with crowding and incompleteness effects leading to a rolloff of detected stars that did not fit the trgb form . in these cases our model for @xmath62",
    "is inadequate and the likelihood analysis is meaningless . in any event ,",
    "it is necessary to set the limits of the magnitude range for which the likelihood analysis is performed ; it is critical to ensure that the faint limit avoids regions where incompleteness is non - negligible .",
    "the bright limit is less critical , but it obviously must be set brighter than the trgb .",
    "we find that setting it at @xmath76 or more magnitudes brighter than the trgb gives good results .",
    "we have used a different approach for estimating random error in the trgb magnitude from most previous authors .",
    "errors from the method of smf96 are generally obtained from the sobel edge  detection response .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath77 is taken as either the @xmath78 in a gaussian fit to the peak response or the fwhm of the peak , e.g. @xcite .",
    "instead we use bootstrap resampling of the data ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) to simulate the act of making the same observation multiple times .",
    "this allows for the most realistic estimate of the standard deviation in the mean .",
    "the magnitudes of all the stars brighter than a given limiting magnitide @xmath79 in an entire population have some luminosity function , @xmath80 .",
    "we observe only a random fraction of the whole stellar population and so determine an observed luminosity function , @xmath81 . from this luminosity function",
    "we determine @xmath77 via either edge detection or maximum likelihood analysis ; let us simply refer to the result of either process as @xmath82 .",
    "we then randomly resample , with replacement , all of the observed magnitudes ( i.e. , any given star may appear more than once or not at all ) .",
    "each stellar magnitude , @xmath83 , carries with it some magnitude error , @xmath84 .",
    "thus , during the resampling @xmath83 is perturbed by its errors such that the resampled magnitude , @xmath85 , will be randomly drawn from a gaussian distribution about the original magnitude with @xmath84 as its standard deviation . for each resampling a bootstrap luminosity function , @xmath86 ,",
    "is then determined , and @xmath87 is measured via @xmath88 .",
    "we perform the bootstrap resampling 500 times for each galaxy and take the standard deviation of the distribution of @xmath87 as the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath77 .",
    "we find that in most cases the estimated uncertainty is a few hundredths to one tenth of one magnitude .",
    "details for each galaxy are given in ",
    "with a robust measurement of the @xmath2 magnitude of the trgb , @xmath77 , we may now calculate the distance modulus .",
    "we start with the following equation : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the bolometric magnitude of the trgb and @xmath91 is the bolometric correction to the @xmath2 magnitude of the trgb .    the quantity @xmath90 was found by ( * ?",

    ", we calculate a histogram of the colors of stars within @xmath101 mag .",
    "we then fit a gaussian to that histogram ( binned at 0.01 mag ) and take its peak as a first guess for @xmath102 . to determine the uncertainty in this value we carry out a bootstrap resampling procedure similar to that used in determination of the uncertainty in @xmath77 .",
    "stellar magnitudes and colors are randomly resampled ( with replacement ) and perturbed by their internal random errors . the histogram calculation and gaussian",
    "fitting are then carried out for each bootstrap resampling ( we used 800 bootstrap samples ) .",
    "we fit a gaussian to the final distribution of @xmath102 values and use its peak and standard deviation as the best estimate of @xmath102 and its uncertainty .",
    "the same procedure is used to determine @xmath96 .",

    "the calibration relations were derived over the metallicity range of the galactic globular clusters ( @xmath103 } \\leq -0.7 $ ] ) and are expected to work well over ages spanning 2 - 15 gyr .",
    "the zero point was calibrated to the same level as that of the rr lyrae distance scale ( used to estimate the distances of the galactic globular clusters ) .",
    "@xcite states generally that for this range @xmath104 mag . more specifically , using the above calibration relations and metallicity range one finds @xmath105 mag with an rms uncertainty of @xmath106 mag and a systematic error of @xmath107 mag .",
    "@xcite treated the trgb as a secondary distance indicator and calibrated a zero point from galaxies with cepheid distances that yielded @xmath108 mag . also , @xcite determined a new trgb calibration based on photometry and a distance estimate from a detached eclipsing binary in the galactic globular cluster @xmath109 centauri .",
    "they found @xmath110 mag .",
    "for this paper we use the calibration of @xcite , but in paper ii we will use the calibration of @xcite for consistency with other recent trgb measurements .",
    "the true distance modulus for each galaxy is computed as @xmath111 we consider total errors in distance to be of two forms for these data .",
    "there are internal errors that are specific to each galaxy and external systematic errors that are the same for all galaxies .",
    "the internal uncertainties in our distances are determined as the sum in quadrature of random and internal systematic errors .",
    "the random errors in the distance moduli are taken as the quadrature sum of the random error in measuring @xmath77 ( estimated via bootstrap resampling ) and @xmath112 as such @xmath113 uncertainties in @xmath112 arise from the errors in measuring the @xmath114 color at @xmath77 and at @xmath115 as described in the previous section .",

    "thus , we have @xmath119 @xmath120 and @xmath121 the systematic magnitude errors ( @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) are the quadrature sums of the aperture and zero point corrections in each bandpass .",
    "the uncertainties in extinction ( @xmath124 ) and reddening ( @xmath125 ) are taken to be 10% of their values ( as per @xcite ) .",
