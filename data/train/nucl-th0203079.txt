    "in many problems of present - day nuclear physics ( structure of the ground state of nuclei close to drip lines , description of weakly bound or unbound excited states , decay of isomeric states ) , one has to explicitly take into account the continuum of scattering states in addition to the discrete spectrum of bound states . a convenient approach to these problems",
    "is provided by the mean - field theory in which pairing correlations are included in a self - consistent way through the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) formalism  @xcite . in this method a set of quasi - particle excitations together with their vacuum is obtained , which forms the basis for a description of ground state properties and spectra . in principle , quasi - particle states , when expressed in terms of the single - particle eigenstates of a one - body hamiltonian , are always superpositions of states belonging to both the discrete and continuous spectra  @xcite . in ordinary stable nuclei , the continuum part of quasi - particle states is usually neglected , as ground state properties and low - energy excitations mainly depend on the discrete quasi - particle states representing occupied and negative energy unoccupied single - particle orbitals .",
    "so , quasi - particles are often obtained using expansions on a discrete basis of orthonormal square - integrable functions .",
    "a very different situation is encountered in weakly bound nuclei , where the gap between the last occupied single - particle level and the continuum of positive energy states may become smaller than a few mev . in this case , the residual pairing interaction is able to induce a significant coupling between the discrete and continuum single - particle states and the contribution of the continuum to quasi - particle states can not be neglected .",
    "in such a situation , new numerical methods for solving the hfb equations have to be implemented , which more or less implicitly , amount to introduce a suitable discretization of the continuum . with these methods , not only the contribution of the continuum to quasi - particle states can be obtained , but also a description of quasi - particles belonging to the continuous spectrum , including resonances .",
    "let us note that such a treatment is necessary to reproduce the unusual properties of weakly bound nuclei such as halos and neutron skins .",
    "several techniques have been proposed in the past along these lines : lattice calculations  @xcite , basis - spline galerkin lattice  @xcite , methods using the local - scale point transformation of the spherical harmonic oscillator wave functions  @xcite , which are adapted to calculations involving zero - range two - body interactions such as the skyrme forces .",
    "another approach , based on the kamimura - gauss basis  @xcite has been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "it appears to be a promising technique for both zero range and finite range forces .",
    "recently , a method has been proposed where the hfb equations are solved in a spherical box with exact boundary conditions for scattering states  @xcite . in these methods ,",
    "the hfb equations are usually expressed in space coordinates , which is especially convenient when a zero - range nucleon - nucleon interaction is used , and interesting results have been obtained in this context  @xcite .    in the case of the finite range gogny interaction  @xcite ,",
    "the hfb equations have always been solved by expanding the quasi - particle states on a finite discrete basis of orthonormal functions . in view of computational convenience ,",
    "the latter are usually chosen as the eigenfunctions of an harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , whose geometry and symmetries are adapted to the nuclear states to be studied .",
    "the hfb equations are then expressed in matrix form , and they are solved by using an iterative procedure .",
    "namely , at iteration @xmath0 , the set of individual wave functions @xmath1 is expanded on a finite basis of generalized eigenstates of a reference hamiltonian @xmath2 , generally taken as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is an harmonic oscillator potential : @xmath5    the @xmath6 are explicitly known and the unknown coefficients @xmath7 are determined using matrix diagonalization techniques .",
    "this simple choice has been found to be appropriate for computing the properties of well bound nuclei , the convergence of the iterative procedure being obtained with a reasonable number of iterations  @xcite . in practice , the sum in ( [ bog15 ] ) is truncated to a number of states @xmath8 corresponding to a number of ho shells ranging from 6 - 8 in light nuclei up to 16 - 20 in heavy and superheavy nuclei .",
    "on the other hand , in exotic nuclei close to drip - lines , weakly bound single - particle states acquire a spatial extension so large that the use of expansions on ho wave functions such as  ( [ bog15 ] ) requires prohibitively large values of @xmath8 . in this case , as mentioned above , an alternative method of solving the hfb equations has to be found .",
    "a natural way to avoid this difficulty is to change the reference potential from which the basis is built .",
    "let us recall the well - known  decomposition of unity \" on a complete basis of generalized eigenstates , associated with a reference hamiltonian , a sum of kinetic and potential terms @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is short - ranged and negative for small @xmath11 .",
    "this decomposition formula can be written formally as @xmath12 where the first ( resp .",
    "second ) contribution corresponds to the discrete ( resp .",
    "continuous ) spectrum of @xmath13 .",
    "numerical simulations  @xcite show that the continuous contribution in ( [ comp ] ) can be neglected in the expansion of single particle states provided the gap between the energy of the last occupied state @xmath14 and the continuous threshold is large enough , which is the case in stable nuclei .    as mentioned before , for nuclei near instability , the gap is small and the continuous contribution in ( [ comp ] ) has to be taken into account .",
    "a new difficulty then appears : a numerical treatment based on equation  ( [ comp ] ) requires to introduce both a discretization and a cut - off in the integral involving continuous states .",
    "this leads to a finite expansion upon discrete basis states which is not necessarly less expensive than the one in ( [ bog15 ] ) , unless one can identify a few states carrying a predominant contribution of the continuous part in ( [ comp ] ) . as shown in a simplified model  @xcite",
    ", such a discretization would probably lead to the same numerical difficulties as above , as the necessary truncation of the integral in (  [ comp ] ) is not likely to be less expensive than a sum with large @xmath8 in  ( [ bog15 ] ) .    as a matter of fact one knows that the so - called metastable or resonant states corresponding to complex singularities of the resolvent give important contributions to the density of states .",
    "these states decay exponentially in time , preventing them to be considered as part of the spectrum , although they correspond to long - living nuclear configurations . moreover it has been soon recognized ( see  @xcite and references therein ) that , despite their pathological asymptotic behaviour , these unstable states could be used as generalized eigenfunctions that can be used to describe resonance phenomena in nuclear collisions . in this framework , a given state is expanded on a set of functions that includes resonant functions on the same footing as bound state eigenfunctions .",
    "the drawbacks of such a procedure are well known : as the resulting problem looses its self - adjointness , the complex spectrum has to be reinterpreted together with the associated wave functions .",
    "however such expansions have been frequently used to describe various physical situations ( potential and obstacle scattering , nuclear reactions ...",
    "recently , this approach has also been used to treat the problem of multiconfiguration mixing within the nuclear shell model  @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to show that this old idea may be applied in a simple way to self - consistent computations when loosely bound or metastable states are expected , which is precisely the case in hfb computations for heavy nuclei , especially those which are close to drip - lines .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secb ] , we consider a model where the schrdinger equation is solved in a bounded domain , and we apply it to a simplified one - body problem . in sec .",
    "[ secc ] some numerical experiments are presented , while sec .",
    "[ secd ] briefly presents our conclusions .",
    "classically , in order to derive generalized eigenfunction expansions such as  ( [ comp ] ) , one first computes the green function associated to the problem and one uses complex analysis to continue this green function and study its singularities .",
    "then , by applying the cauchy residue theorem , one obtains ( [ comp ] ) , where the sum corresponds to the discrete spectrum , and the integral takes into account the continuous part of the spectrum ( see appendix a ) .    a natural way to avoid the delicate discretization of the continuous contribution in ( [ comp ] ) is to restrict the initial problem to a bounded region @xmath15 , where one expects that most of the physics takes place , and to impose `` transparent '' boundary conditions reflecting the properties of the exterior ( unbounded ) domain .",
    "in fact , this last point deserves a special comment .",
    "it is clear that the kind of artificial conditions we impose on the boundary must be of particular nature in order to mimic the behaviour of the  exterior world \" , in a transparent way : the waves produced in the interior region must not be disturbed ( reflected ) by the boundary .",
    "for example , a standard dirichlet or von neumann boundary conditions would lead to a problem essentially different from the one we want to solve and would produce results without clear connection with the solution of our original problem .",
    "one can check easily in particular that dirichlet condition would lead to nothing but a fourier series expansion , which makes the obtained solution strongly domain - dependent .",
    "one can show that this kind of  transparent \" boundary conditions , which has been developped in the acoustic domain and more recently in the schrdinger context ( see  @xcite and references therein ) leads to a complex condition producing a non - selfadjoint problem : this is the price to pay for  replacing the exterior by the boundary \" .    by restricting the domain",
    ", one can hope to get improved asymptotic properties for the modified green functions , allowing one to bypass the integral along the physical cuts in ( [ comp ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "complex isolated singularities appear outside the imaginary axis , coming from the artificial complex conditions at the boundary of @xmath15 .    to our knowledge",
    ", this idea goes back to kapur and peierls  @xcite who first introduced in the thirties non self - adjoint flux conditions associated to schrdinger equations , a method which has been widely used in the context of nuclear reactions  @xcite .      in the particular situation of the square",
    "well potential , the above method can be worked out in a very simple way . the idea is to replace the harmonic oscillator by a new reference potential @xmath10 such that the hamiltonian @xmath16 has a continuous spectrum , in order to describe more accurately the loosely bound states and , if necessary , metastable states .",
    "as we expect that the physics takes place in the region @xmath15 where the potential is non - zero , we restrict the dynamics to @xmath15 and we impose a boundary condition at the boundary which mimics the external scattering behaviour .    to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the schrdinger equation for a particle in a compactly supported spherically symmetric potential @xmath10 : @xmath17 where we have considered @xmath18 and an orbital momentum @xmath19 . as a new reference potential @xmath10",

    "\\label{pui}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we chose the square well because the associated eigenfunctions are rather elementary ( bessel functions ) .",
    "moreover , in order to simplify the arguments we restrict the analysis to @xmath23-waves , in which case the eigenfunctions are simply sine and cosine functions .    as an extra boundary condition for @xmath24",
    ", we choose the free radiation condition : @xmath25 from the above discussion about  transparent \" boundary conditions , we stress that the non - selfadjoint boundary condition ( [ bord ] ) amounts to fix an imaginary flux condition reflecting exactly the physical radiation behaviour at infinity for the free schrdinger equation .",
    "we feel that this choice corresponds to our purpose to produce the smallest perturbation near the artificial boundary @xmath24 .    the problem ( [ schrodinger_radial])-([bord ] ) is easily solved by computing the corresponding green function ( see appendix a ) , giving simple explicit expressions for the associated eigenfunctions and the following expansion for any function @xmath26 : @xmath27 where the @xmath28 are the solutions both , real and complex , of the equation : @xmath29 with @xmath30 . for real roots",
    "we recover bound and virtual state eigenfunctions , while for non real ones we get resonant and anti - resonant eigenfunctions .",
    "let us consider the familiar hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations : @xmath31 where the particle - hole and particle - particle potentials @xmath32 and @xmath33 depend on @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "in order to solve this non linear eigenvalue problem we expand the unknown wave functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 on our reference basis , suitably truncated up to a rank @xmath38 , depending on the desired accuracy : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and the coefficients @xmath41 are obtained by solving the transcendental equation ( [ treq ] ) .    replacing the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 by there expansions , multiplying on the left by @xmath44 and integrating , one gets the following expressions for ( [ eqhfb ] ) : @xmath45 or in matrix form : @xmath46 where *",

    "the expansion we use is valid only for @xmath52 and expansion ( [ fifi ] ) concerns only the part of the functions @xmath53 defined in this interval .",

    "let us note that similar formulas have to be employed if the potentials @xmath32 and @xmath33 contain velocity - dependent contributions for example in the spin - orbit components .    in the case of a nucleon - nucleon force of simple form ( skyrme or gogny forces ) , the matrices @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath33 can be calculated analytically .",
    "let us note that since * t * and * r * are hermitian matrices , the reality of the eigenvalues in equation ( [ eqvpg ] ) is insured .",

    "let us introduce the normal reduced density @xmath59 :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 denotes the lower component of the @xmath62 solution of equation ( [ eqvpga ] ) . with a similar notation , the abnormal reduced density @xmath63 is given by : @xmath64 using expansion ( [ fifi ] ) , these relations become : @xmath65 and : @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "the interpretation of these quantities is clear ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the normal density is localized as soon as the chemical parameter @xmath68 is negative .",
    "the canonical basis @xmath69 is defined as the set of eigenvectors of the normal density : @xmath70 where the eigenvalues @xmath71 are the occupation probabilities of the corresponding canonical states .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if the @xmath72 are expanded in the same way as the quasi - particle wave functions , this equation corresponds to : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the vector built with the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the matrix defined by : @xmath77 it is important to stress that @xmath78 is not properly speaking a representation of the normal density since the set of functions @xmath79 does not form a basis .",
    "finally , we define the energies of the canonical states as the diagonal matrix element of the hartree - fock hamiltonian in the basis of the canonical states  @xcite : @xmath80 this term can be easily written once the coefficients of the expansion of the canonical states are known .",
    "to illustrate this method we have chosen to solve a simplified problem of hfb type with spherical symmetry .",
    "we consider the following equations :    @xmath81    where @xmath57 is the kinetic energy operator , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respectively the particle - hole and particle - particle mean - fields .",

    "we complete this set with the lowest resonances and companion anti - resonances .",
    "the corresponding functions are not orthogonal and we can not build the matrix @xmath88 using all of them , otherwise the generalized eigenvalue problem ( [ eqvpga ] ) would be  at least numerically  singular . in order to reject some functions we use the following procedure : we build the full matrix @xmath88 , using all functions and try to invert it with a simple gauss method . during this calculation ,",

    "we have presented in this work an expansion method which can be used to express both discrete and continuum solutions of the most general hf or hfb equations , when any kind of nucleon - nucleon interaction is used . because of the simplicity of the functions on which we expand the solutions , many steps of the resolution can be done analytically .",
    "this is the great advantage of the method .",

    "let us note that in the limit where the depth of the rectangular well goes to infinity ( @xmath115 in equation ( [ pui ] ) ) usual discrete fourier expansions are recovered . in that case",
    "the formalism is greatly simplified because the transcendental equation ( [ treq ] ) becomes trivial and the overlap matrix * r * reduces to unity .    the more general case investigated here",
