    "the directed subdifferential was originally introduced in @xcite for dc ( delta - convex , i.e.  difference of convex ) functions as the difference of the moreau - rockafellar subdifferentials of two convex functions embedded in the space of directed sets @xcite , and later was extended in @xcite to the class of quasidifferentiable ( qd ) functions .",
    "the directed subdifferential enjoys exact calculus rules , and gives the same sharp optimality conditions as the demyanov - rubinov quasidifferential or the dini subdifferential and superdifferential .",
    "however , in contrast to the quasidifferential , the directed subdifferential is uniquely defined . moreover ,",
    "one of the major challenges in quasidifferential calculus associated with the dc decomposition is not relevant for the directed subdifferential : in this work we show that the directed subdifferential can be constructed without any knowledge of the underlying dc structure .",
    "in fact , the function ( or its directional derivative ) does not need to be dc .",
    "we extend the domain of definition of the directed subdifferential to a large class of functions on @xmath0 , essentially wider than qd functions .",
    "this class includes all locally lipschitz functions definable on o - minimal structure and tame functions ( see @xcite ) . to our best knowledge , whether or not lipschitz definable functions are dc constitutes an open problem .",
    "let us note that other widely used subdifferentials can be evaluated via the directed subdifferential : dini / frchet , michel - penot , and , in some cases also , clarke and mordukhovich subdifferentials ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this together with the exact calculus rules for the directed subdifferential may help in practical applications where computing nonconvex subdifferentials is needed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ secpreliminaries ] , we remind the basic ideas behind the banach space of the directed sets , and , in section  [ secdirsubddc ] , we briefly introduce the directed subdifferential , if a dc structure for the function or its directional derivative is known . to give the reader the flavour of our results and to explain our motivation , in section  [ secconstrfordc ] we demonstrate how to construct the directed subdifferential for dc functions without knowing the dc decomposition . section  [ secdirsubdiff ] is devoted to ` directed subdifferentiable ' functions and a rigorous definition of the directed subdifferential for such functions is given there , as well as caculus rules and one example of a directed differentiable function which is not quasidifferentiable .",
