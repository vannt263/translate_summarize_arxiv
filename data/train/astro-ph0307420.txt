    "one of the defining characteristics of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is that their x - ray emission is variable .",
    "x - ray light curves from seyfert 1 galaxies show unpredictable and seemingly aperiodic variability ( lawrence et al .  1987 ; m@xmath2hardy 1989 ) .",
    "such random variability is often referred to as _ noise _ , meaning that it is the result of a stochastic , as opposed to deterministic , process . in this context",
    "the ` noise ' is intrinsic to the source and not a result of measurement errors ( such as poisson noise ) , i.e. the signal itself is the output of a noise process .",
    "one of the most common tools for examining agn variability ( and noise processes in general ) is the fluctuation power spectral density ( psd ) which represents the amount of variability power ( mean of the squared amplitude ) as a function of temporal frequency ( timescale@xmath3 ) .",
    "the high frequency psds of seyferts are usually well - represented by power - laws over a broad range of frequencies ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the power at frequency @xmath6 ) with slopes @xmath7 ( green , m@xmath2hardy & lehto , 1993 ; lawrence & papadakis , 1993 ; edelson & nandra , 1999 ; uttley , m@xmath2hardy & papadakis , 2002 ; vaughan , fabian & nandra 2003 ; markowitz et al .",
    "such a spectrum , with a slope @xmath8 is usually called ` red noise ' ( for an introduction to red noise see press 1978 ) .",
    "if seyfert  1 light curves are viewed as the product of a stochastic ( in this case red noise ) process then the specific details of each individual light curve provide little physical insight .",
    "each light curve is only one _ realisation _ of the underlying stochastic process , i.e. it is one of the _ ensemble _ of random light curves that might be generated by the process .",
    "each new realisation will look different and these changes are simply statistical fluctuations inherent in any stochastic process ( as opposed to changes in the nature of the process itself ) .",
    "therefore one should expect two light curves to have different characteristics ( such as mean and variance ) even if they are realisations of the same process . on the other hand , data from deterministic processes , for example the energy spectrum of a non - varying source or the light curve of a strictly periodic source ( such as a pulsar ) , should be repeatable within the limits set by the measurement errors .",
    "it is the average properties of the variability ( such as the psd ) that often provide most insight into the driving process .",
    "for example , the psd of any real red noise process can not continue as a steep power - law indefinitely to longer timescales or the integrated variability power would diverge .",
    "therefore the psds of agn variability must break to a flatter index at low frequencies ; the position of such a break would represent a characteristic variability timescale and may yield information about the underlying driving process .",
    "recent timing studies have indeed found evidence that the steep power - law psds of seyfert  1s show a flattening , or turnover , at low frequencies ( edelson & nandra 1999 ; uttley et al .",
    "2002 ; markowitz et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in many cases however the data are not adequate for psd analysis . in these situations",
    "the variability is usually described in terms of the statistical moments ( e.g. the sample mean and variance , etc . ) . however , due to the stochastic nature of red noise variability there is a large degree of randomness associated with these quantities . in practice",
    "this means that it is difficult to assign meaningful errors to the variance .",
    "this in turn makes it difficult to quantitatively compare variances , say from repeated observations of the same source ( and thereby test whether the variability is _ stationary _ ) .",
    "such an analysis might be desirable ; it could in principle reveal changes in the ` state ' of the source if its variability properties were found to evolve with time .",
    "this paper discusses this and related problems that are encountered when examining the variability properties of agn .",
    "particular emphasis is placed on the mathematical properties and implications of the inherent randomness in the variability .",
    "the mathematical details are well understood from the general theory of stochastic processes ( e.g. priestley 1981 for spectral analysis ) but some of the practical consequences for agn observations have not been discussed in detail . on the basis of simulated data some recipes are developed that may serve as a useful guide for observers wishing make quantitative use of their variability analysis without the recourse to e.g. extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sect : stats ] defines the estimators to be discussed ( namely the periodogram and the variance ) .",
    "simulated data are used to illustrate various aspects of these estimators ; section  [ sect : simulations ] describes methods for producing artificial red noise time series .",
    "section  [ sect : stationarity ] discusses the stationarity of time series .",
    "sections  [ sect : errors_intrinsic ] and [ sect : errors_poisson ] discuss two sources of uncertainty associated with measuring variability amplitudes , the first due to the stochastic nature of the variability and the second due to flux measurement errors .",
    "section  [ sect : mrk766 ] gives an example using a real _ xmm - newton_observation of .",
    "finally , a brief discussion of these results is given in section  [ sect : disco ] and the conclusions are summarised in section  [ sect : conc ] .",
    "the psd defines the amount of variability ` power ' as a function of temporal frequency .",
    "it is estimated by calculating the _ periodogram _ , which is an estimator of the continuous psd @xmath5 .",
    "the periodogram is therefore specific to each realisation of the process , whereas the psd is representative of the true , underlying process . ]",
    "( priestley 1981 ; bloomfield 2000 ) .    for an evenly sampled light curve ( with a sampling period @xmath9 )",
    "the periodogram is the modulus - squared of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) of the data ( press et al .",
    "1996 ) . for a light curve comprising a series of fluxes @xmath10 measured at discrete times @xmath11 : @xmath12 at @xmath13 evenly spaced frequencies @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the nyquist frequency , @xmath17 .",
    "note that it is customary to subtract the mean flux from the light curve before calculating the dft .",
    "this eliminates the zero - frequency power .",
    "the periodogram , @xmath18 , is then calculated by choosing an appropriate normalisation @xmath19 ( see appendix  [ sect : pds_norm ] for more on periodogram normalisations ) .",
    "for example @xmath20    if the time series is a photon counting signal such as normally encountered in x - ray astronomy , and is binned into intervals of @xmath9 , the effect of poisson noise is to add an approximately constant amount of power to the periodogram at all frequencies . with the above normalisation this constant poisson noise level is @xmath21 ( assuming the light curve is not background subtracted ) .",
    "the periodogram of a noise process , if measured from a single time series , shows a great deal of scatter around the underlying psd .",
    "in particular , the periodogram at a given frequency [ @xmath22 is scattered around the psd [ @xmath5 ] following a @xmath24 distribution with two degrees of freedom ( van der klis 1989 ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a random variable distributed as @xmath24 with two degrees of freedom , i.e. an exponential distribution with a mean and variance of two and four , respectively .",
    "the periodogram is distributed in this way because the real and imaginary parts of the dft are normally distributed for a stochastic process is even so the periodogram at this frequency is distributed as @xmath27 , i.e. with one degree of freedom . ]",
    "( section 6.2 of priestley , 1981 ; jenkins & watts 1968 ) .",
    "the expectation value of the periodogram is equal to the psd but its standard deviation is 100 per cent , leading to the larger scatter in the periodogram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : two_curves ] ) . see leahy et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , van der klis ( 1989 ) , papadakis & lawrence ( 1993 ) , timmer & knig ( 1995 ) and stella et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for further discussion of this point .",
    "when applied to real data the periodogram is an _",
    "inconsistent _ estimator of the psd , meaning that the scatter in the periodogram does not decrease as the number of data points in the light curve increases ( jenkins & watts 1968 ) .",
    "in order to reduce this scatter the periodogram must be smoothed ( averaged ) in some fashion . as the number of data points per bin increases ( either by binning over frequencies or averaging over many data segments ) the scatter in the binned periodogram decreases , i.e. the averaged periodogram is a _ consistent _ estimator of the psd ( see papadakis & lawrence 1993 and van der klis 1997 for more on binned periodogram estimates ) .",
    "a further point is that periodograms measured from finite data tend to be biased by windowing effects which further complicate their interpretation ( van der klis 1989 ; papadakis & lawrence 1993 ; uttley et al .  2002 and see below ) .",
    "the integral of the psd between two frequencies ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) yields the contribution to the expectation value of the ( ` true ' ) variance due to variations between the corresponding timescales ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "this result follows from parseval s theorem ( see e.g. van der klis 1989 ) @xmath32 correspondingly , for a discrete time series the integrated periodogram yields the observed variance for that particular realisation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the frequency resolution of the dft ( @xmath35 ) . the total variance of a real light curve is equal to its periodogram integrated over the frequency range @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the sample variance ( which will differ from observation to observation ) is given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the arithmetic mean of @xmath40 .",
    "in the limit of large @xmath41 these two variance estimates are identical .",
    "the normalised variance is simply @xmath42 .",
    "in order to elucidate the properties of the variance of red noise data , random light curves were generated from power - law psds similar to those of agn .",
    "[ fig : two_curves ] shows two artificial time series and their periodograms .",
    "it is worth reiterating that the large scatter in the periodograms is an intrinsic property of stochastic processes  it does not depend on the number of data points and is not related to poisson noise in the data .",
    "these artificial time series were produced using the algorithm of timmer & knig ( 1995 ) .",
    "this generates random time series with arbitrary broad - band psd , correctly accounting for the intrinsic scatter in the powers ( i.e. equation  [ eqn : pds_scatter ] ) .",
    "other methods of generating random light curves include the related ` summing of sines ' method ( done et al .",
    "note that it is not correct to randomise only the phases of the component sine functions , their amplitudes must also be randomised .",
    "otherwise this method does not account for this intrinsic scatter in the powers .",
    "shot - noise models can produce red noise time series with certain psd shapes ( see lehto 1989 ) .",
    "there also exist various mathematical tricks for producing data with specific power - law psd slopes .",
    "data with a @xmath43 psd ( often called ` flicker noise ' ) can be generated using the half - integral method outlined in press ( 1978 ) , while @xmath44 ( ` random walk ' ) data can be generated using a first - order autoregressive process ( ar[1 ] ) , essentially a running sum of gaussian deviates ( see deeming 1970 and scargle 1981 for more on such methods ) .",
    "the method of timmer & knig ( 1995 ) is used below as this can generate time series from an arbitrary psd and is computationally efficient .      some caution should be applied when using these routines to produce artificial time series . as mentioned briefly in the previous section ,",
    "periodograms measured from real data tend to be biased by windowing effects . for uninterrupted but finite observations data of red noise processes the most important of these effects is ` red noise leak '  the transfer of power from low to high frequencies by the lobes of the window function ( see e.g. deeter & boynton 1982 ; van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "if there is significant power at frequencies below the lowest frequency probed by the periodogram ( i.e. on timescales longer than the length of the observation ) this can give rise to slow rising or falling trends across the light curve .",
    "these trends contribute to the variance of the light curve .",
    "thus variability power ` leaks ' into the data from frequencies below the observed frequency band - pass .",
    "the degree to which this occurs , and the resultant bias on the measured periodogram , depend on the shape of the underlying psd and the length of the observation ( papadakis & lawrence 1995 ; uttley et al .",
    "for flat psd slopes ( @xmath45 ) the amount of leakage from low frequencies is usually negligible .",
    "since agn light curves usually contain significant power on timescales longer than those probed ( see section  [ sect : weak_non - stationarity ] ) the effects of red noise leak must be included in simulations of agn light curves .",
    "this can be achieved by using the timmer & knig ( 1995 ) algorithm to generate a long light curve from a psd that extends to very low frequencies and then using a light curve segment of the required length .",
    "data simulated in such a fashion will include power on timescales much longer than covered in the short segment . the effects of measurement errors ( e.g. poisson noise ) can be included in the simulations using standard techniques ( e.g. press et al .",
    "a stationary process is one for which the statistical properties ( such as mean , variance , etc . )",
    "do not depend on time .",
    "[ fig : curve1 ] shows an artificial red noise time series together with its mean and variance measured every 20 data points .",
    "the simulation was produced from a single , well - defined psd ( which did not vary ) .",
    "the process is therefore stationary .",
    "it would have been reasonable to expect the resulting time series ( a realisation of the process ) to appear stationary .",
    "this is not the case however ; both the mean and variance change with time ( panels 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this has nothing whatsoever to do with measurement errors - the simulation has zero errors .",
    "this simulation demonstrates that , when dealing with red noise , fluctuations in variance are not sufficient to claim the variability process is non - stationary .",
    "as the purpose of time series analysis is to gain insight into the process , not the details of any specific realisation , a more robust approach is needed to determine whether these data were produced by a time - stationary process or a non - stationary process .",
    "it would be more insightful to consider whether the _ expectation values _ of the characteristics ( such as the variance ) are time - variable .",
    "the expectation values should be representative of the properties of the underlying process , not just any one realisation .",
    "see section 1.3 of bendat & piersol ( 1986 ) for a discussion of this point .      for",
    "a process with a steep red noise psd ( @xmath46 ) , the integrated periodogram will diverge as @xmath47 .",
    "this means that ( following equation  [ eqn : correspondence1 ] ) the variance of a red noise time series with a steep psd will diverge with time . in this case",
    "there is no well - defined mean ; press & rybicki ( 1997 ) describe this form of variability as ` weakly non - stationary . ' for time series with power spectra flatter than this the variance converges as @xmath47 , thus for a white noise process with a flat psd ( @xmath48 ) , the variance will converge as the observation length increases , and there will be a well - defined mean on long timescales .    of course",
    ", for any real process the psd must eventually flatten such that the power does not diverge ( i.e. @xmath49 on sufficiently long timescales ) . thus , weak non - stationarity is entirely due to observations sampling only the steep part of the psd of a source . but in agn this flattening occurs on timescales much longer than those probed by typical observations . for instance , _ xmm - newton _  observations of agn typically last for @xmath50  s whereas in many objects the psd is steep until @xmath51  s and in some cases probably much longer ( edelson & nandra 1999 ; uttley et al .  2002 ; markowitz et al .  2003 ) .",
    "therefore on the timescales relevant for most x - ray observations , agn light curves should be considered weakly non - stationary .",

    "[ fig : fvar_dist1 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=5 ]    fluctuations in the statistical moments ( such as mean and variance ) of a light curve are intrinsic to red noise processes .",
    "therefore , even in the absence of measurement errors ( e.g. no poisson noise ) the means and variances of two light curves produced by exactly the same process can be significantly different .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : curve1 ] ( panels 2 and 3 ) , where each 20 point segment of the light curve shows a different mean and variance .",
    "these random fluctuations in variance are however governed by the normal statistical rules of noise processes and can thus be understood in a statistical sense .",
    "any given series is only one realisation of the processes and its periodogram will show the scatter predicted by equation  [ eqn : pds_scatter ] .",
    "the integrated periodogram ( which gives the variance ; equation  [ eqn : correspondence ] ) will therefore be randomly scattered around the true value for the psd of the process .",
    "the variance in a specific time series is given by @xmath54 i.e. the variance of a given realisation is a sum of @xmath26 distributions weighted by the psd for even @xmath41 .",
    "however , for large @xmath41 this will make a negligible difference to the sum ( cf .",
    "equation 2.9 of van der klis , 1989 ) . ] .",
    "( this assumes biases such as red noise leak are not significant .",
    "if this is not true then these biases will further distort the distribution of variances . )",
    "it is the expectation value of the variance that is representative of the integrated power in the psd , and thus the average amplitude of the variability process ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : correspondence1 ] ) .",
    "thus , while the expectation value of the variance is equal to the integrated psd , each realisation ( time series ) of the same process will show a different variance even if the parent variability process is stationary .",
    "this is particularly important for steep psd time series ( i.e. weakly non - stationary data ) since the variance does not converge as more data are collected .",
    "only if the time series spans timescales on which the integrated power converges at low frequencies ( i.e. @xmath55 ) will the variance converge as the length of time series increases .",
    "these points are illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar_dist1 ] , which shows the distributions of variances in random time series with three different psd slopes ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "this plot was produced by generating 50,000 random time series ( each 100 points long ) for each psd slope and measuring the variance of each one .",
    "the scatter in the variance is entirely due to random fluctuations between different realisations because the psd normalisation was kept fixed and no instrumental noise was added .",
    "the shape of the distribution of variances can be seen to depend on the psd slope .",
    "consider a white noise process ( @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath57 ) .",
    "the periodogram of each realisation is randomly scattered around its flat psd . following equation  [ eqn : sum_var ]",
    "the variance is simply the sum of the @xmath13 @xmath26-distributed powers in the periodogram , and these are evenly weighted ( psd is constant ) .",
    "the sum of @xmath13 @xmath26 distributions follows a @xmath58 distribution .",
    "this tends to a normal distribution as @xmath41 increases .",
    "thus the variance of a white noise process is approximately normally distributed ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar_dist1 ] ) and converges as @xmath41 increases .",
    "the fractional standard deviation of @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 , so for the 100 point light curves used the ( 1@xmath60 ) fractional width of the variance distribution is @xmath61 per cent , in agreement with the simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar_dist1 ] , top panel ) .    for time series with steeper psds",
    "the lower frequency periodogram points contribute more strongly to the sum than the higher frequency points .",
    "the variance of such a time series is therefore dominated by a few low frequency powers and thus resembles a @xmath62 distribution with low ` effective degrees of freedom . '",
    "the distribution of variances in red noise data is dependent on the underlying psd and is , in general , non - gaussian ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar_dist1 ] ) .",
    "the fractional standard deviation of @xmath62 is @xmath63 , which tends to unity as the psd gets steeper ( i.e. as effective @xmath64 ) .",
    "thus the largest fluctuations in variance ( up to a limit of @xmath65 per cent rms ) are expected to result from very steep psd slopes .",
    "as discussed above , when examining agn light curves one should expect random changes in the mean and variance with time ( between segments of a long observation or between observations taken at different epochs ) . this is true even if the measurement errors are zero and does not depend on the number of data points used ( due to the weak non - stationarity ) . however , it is also possible that the underlying process responsible for the variability itself changes with time ( e.g. the psd changes ) , in which case the variability is non - stationary in a more meaningful sense  ` strongly non - stationary . '",
    "such changes in the variability process could provide insight into the changing physical conditions in the nuclear regions . on the other hand the random changes expected for a red noise process yield no such physical insight .",
    "the question thus arises : how does one tell , from a set of time series of the same source , whether they were produced by a strongly non - stationary process ?",
    "in other words , is it possible to differentiate between differences in variance caused by real changes in the variability process ( physical changes in the system ) , and random fluctuations expected from red noise ( random nature of the process ) ?",
    "if the process responsible for the variability observed in a given source is stationary then its psd is constant in time",
    ". the expectation value of the absolute ( un - normalised ) variance will therefore be the same from epoch to epoch , but the individual variance estimates will fluctuate as discussed in section  [ sect : stochasticity ] .",
    "this makes it difficult to judge , from just the variances of two light curves taken at two epochs , whether they were produced by a stationary process .",
    "given sufficient data it is , however , possible to test whether the expectation values of the variance ( estimated from an ensemble of light curves ) at two epochs are consistent with a stationary process .      the methods most frequently employed involve comparing the psds ( estimated from the binned periodogram ) at different epochs .",
    "if the psds show significant differences ( at a given confidence level ) the variability process can be said to be strongly non - stationary . as an example of this , the psds of x - ray binaries evolve with time , and the way in which the variability properties evolve provides a great deal of information on the detailed workings of these systems ( see e.g. belloni & hasinger 1990 ; uttley & m@xmath66hardy 2001 ; belloni , psaltis & van der klis 2002 ; pottschmidt et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "papadakis & lawrence ( 1995 ) suggested a method suitable for testing whether large agn datasets display evidence for strongly non - stationary variability . again",
    "this method works by comparing the psds from different time intervals , in this case by determining whether the differences between two periodograms are consistent with the scatter expected based on equation  [ eqn : pds_scatter ] .",
    "in particular , they define a statistic @xmath67 based on the ratio of two normalised periodograms . if @xmath67 deviates significantly from its expected value for stationary data ( if @xmath68 ) then the hypothesis that the data are stationary can be rejected ( at some confidence level ) .",
    "a different approach is compare variances @xmath69 derived from @xmath70 observations of the same source ( either segments of one long observation or separate short observations ) . in order to test whether the @xmath69 differ significantly ( i.e. more than expected for a red noise process ) a measure of the expected scatter is required .",
    "this error could be obtained directly from the data ( by measuring the standard deviation of multiple estimates ) or through simulations ( based on an assumed psd shape ) .",
    "an empirical estimate of the mean and standard deviation of the variance can be made given @xmath70 non - overlapping data segments .",
    "the @xmath70 segments each yield an estimate of the variance data points in order to yield a meaningful variance .",
    "] , @xmath69 .",
    "each of these is an independent variable of ( in general ) unknown but identical distribution ( unless the process is strongly non - stationary ) .",
    "the central limit theorem dictates that the sum of these will become normally distributed as @xmath70 increases .",
    "therefore by averaging the @xmath70 variance estimates it is possible to produce an averaged variance ( @xmath71 ) and assign an error bar in the usual fashion ( e.g. equation 4.14 of bevington & robinson 1992 ) .",
    "this gives a robust estimate of the variance and the standard deviation of the @xmath70 variances around the mean gives an estimate of the uncertainty on the mean variance .",
    "if several sets of data segments are acquired it is therefore possible to compare the mean variance of each set statistically ( since each has an associated uncertainty ) .",
    "for example , with two long _ xmm - newton _  observations of the same source , taken a year apart , one could measure the variance for each observation ( by breaking each into short segments and taking the mean variance of the segments ) .",
    "thus it would be possible to test whether the variability was stationary between the two observations .",
    "this method of estimating the mean and standard deviation of the variance requires a large amount of data . of order",
    "@xmath72 data points are needed to produce a single well - determined estimate of the mean variance and its error .",
    "a typical _ xmm - newton _  observation of a bright seyfert 1 galaxy ( @xmath73  ks duration ) is only likely to yield enough data for one estimate of the mean variance .",
    "thus this method is suitable for testing whether the mean variance has changed from observation to observation .",
    "[ fig : curve1 ] ( panel 4 ) demonstrates this empirically derived mean variance and its error bar on a long , simulated time series . these data were produced by calculating the variances @xmath69 in bins of @xmath74 data points ( panel 3 ) and then averaging @xmath75 variances to produce a mean variance with error bar ( panel 4 ) .",
    "these averaged variances are consistent with constant , as expected ; fitting these data with a constant gave @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig : curve2 ] shows the rms amplitude is constant with flux .",
    "these tests indicate that the integrated psd is consistent with being constant with time ; the variance does not change significantly from epoch to epoch ( or as function of flux ) , as expected for a stationary process .",
    "the advantage of the above method is that it requires no assumption about the shape of the psd , the drawback is that it requires a substantial amount of data to produce a single , robust variance estimate .",
    "an alternative approach is to estimate the standard deviation of the variances @xmath69 based on simulations .    given an assumed shape for the psd it is possible to calculate the distribution of variances expected for a stationary process ( see section  [ sect : stochasticity ] ) .",
    "some example distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar_dist1 ] , which clearly demonstrates how the distribution depends on the slope of the psd .",
    "the distribution becomes more normal at flatter slopes and more asymmetric at steep slopes . for a given psd shape these distributions",
    "are well defined ( by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sum_var ] ) and can be computed through monte carlo simulations .",
    "this makes it possible to estimate limits within which one would expect the variance to be distributed if the process is stationary .",
    "the two primary factors that affect the distribution of variance are the psd shape and the sampling of the light curve ( the length of the data segments in the case of contiguously binned light curves ) .",
    "table  [ table ] gives the expected confidence limits for four different psd shapes and five different lengths for the data segments .",
    "these values were computed by simulating one very long light curve with the assumed psd shape and breaking it into @xmath77 separate segments ( of specified length ) .",
    "the variance within each segment was measured and the distribution of the @xmath77 variances was calculated .",
    "the @xmath78 per cent confidence interval was calculated by finding the @xmath79th and @xmath80th percentiles of the variance distribution ( in general these upper and lower bounds will differ because the distribution is asymmetric ) .",
    "the numbers given in the table are the boundaries of the @xmath78 and @xmath81 per cent confidence regions estimated by averaging the results from @xmath82 runs .",
    "the limits are given in terms of @xmath83 because they are multiplicative .",

    "however , the @xmath78 per cent region spans an order of magnitude in variance .",
    "thus even order of magnitude differences in variance between short sections of a light curve are to be expected and do not necessarily indicate that the underlying process is not stationary .",
    "subtle changes in the psd will thus be difficult to detect by examining the raw variances as the intrinsic scatter is so large .",
    "such changes could be revealed by comparing averaged variances or comparing the psds as described above .",
    "the datasets considered thus far have been ideal , in the sense that they are free from flux uncertainties . in real life , however , a light curve @xmath10 will have finite uncertainties @xmath96 due to measurement errors ( such as poisson noise in the case of an x - ray photon counting signal ) .",
    "these uncertainties on the individual flux measurements will contribute an additional variance .",
    "this leads to the use of the ` excess variance ' ( nandra et al .",
    "1997 ; edelson et al .  2002 ) as an estimator of the _ intrinsic _ source variance .",
    "this is the variance after subtracting the contribution expected from measurement errors @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mean square error @xmath99 the normalised excess variance is given by @xmath100 and the fractional root mean square ( rms ) variability amplitude ( @xmath0 ; edelson , pike & krolik 1990 ; rodriguez - pascual et al .",
    "1997 ) is the square root of this , i.e. @xmath101    the statistic @xmath95 is often chosen in preference to @xmath102 although the two convey exactly the same information .",
    "@xmath95 is a linear statistics and can therefore give the rms variability amplitude in per centage terms . the choice of whether to quote @xmath95 or @xmath103 is usually purely one of presentation .",
    "it is worth noting that the monte carlo results given in section  [ sect : sim_table ] , to estimate the expected scatter on the variance , can also be applied to its square root .",
    "the expected boundaries of the confidence region of the logarithm of the rms is approximately half those of the variance .",
    "specifically , @xmath104 and similarly @xmath105 .",
    "an x - ray light curve of an agn can be split into different energy bands .",
    "the light curves in each band will be strictly simultaneous and can be used to test whether the x - ray variability is a function of energy .",
    "for example , one might examine the ratio of a soft band light curve to a hard band light curve .",
    "the statistical significance of any variations in the ratio can be quantified by propagating the measurement errors and applying an appropriate test , such as the @xmath24 test of the constant ratio hypothesis .",
    "if the ratio shows variations greater than those expected from the errors then the two light curves are intrinsically different and the source does indeed show spectral variability .",
    "such changes in the energy spectrum with time can in principle provide valuable clues to the nature of the x - ray source",
    ". this test does not provide any quantitative description of the spectral variability .",
    "another tool for investigating spectral variability is the rms spectrum , i.e. the rms variability amplitude ( or @xmath95 ) as a function of energy .",
    "see e.g. inoue & matsumoto ( 2001 ) , edelson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , fabian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and schurch & warwick ( 2002 ) for some examples of rms spectra from agn .",
    "however , when examining rms spectra it is often not clear whether changes in the amplitude with energy reflect real energy - dependence of the intrinsic variability amplitude or are caused by random errors in the light curves .",
    "the finite measurement errors on the individual fluxes ( e.g. due to poisson noise ) will introduce some uncertainty in the estimated rms amplitudes .",
    "an estimate of this uncertainty would help answer the question posed above , namely whether features in rms spectra are the result of random errors in the data or represent spectral variations intrinsic to the source .",
    "the problem of how to assess the uncertainty on the excess variance ( or @xmath95 ) is a long - standing one ( e.g. nandra et al .  1997 ; turner et al .  1999 ; edelson et al .",
    "the standard error formulae presented in the literature ( e.g. turner et al .  1999 ; edelson et al .",
    "2002 ) are formally valid in the case of un - correlated gaussian processes . typically agn light curves at different x - ray energies are strongly correlated and are not gaussian . however , when searching for subtle differences in amplitude between simultaneous and correlated light curves it may be more useful to have an indication of the uncertainty resulting from the finite flux errors .",
    "a monte carlo approach was used to develop a prescription of the effect of measurement errors on estimates of @xmath95 ( and @xmath106 ) .",
    "a short red noise light curve was generated .",
    "poisson noise was added ( i.e. the individual flux measurements were randomised following the poisson distribution ) and the excess variance was recorded .",
    "the fluxes of the original light curve were randomised again and the excess variance recorded , this was repeated many times .",
    "the distribution of excess variances was then used to determine the uncertainty in the variance estimate caused by poisson noise .",
    "full details of the procedure are given in appendix  [ sect : mc ]    for these simulations it was found that the error on @xmath106 decreases as the s / n in the light curve is increased according to : @xmath107 see appendix  b for details of this equation and its equivalent in terms of @xmath0 .    as this only accounts for the effect of flux measurement errors ( such as poisson noise ) in a given light curve",
    "it can be used to test whether two simultaneously observed light curves of the same source , but in different bands , show consistent amplitudes .",
    "a demonstration of this using real data is given in the following section .",
    "this uncertainty does not account for the random scatter intrinsic to the red noise process , therefore the absolute value of the rms spectrum will change between realisations ( i.e. from epoch to epoch ) .",
    "but if a source shows achromatic variability then the values of @xmath0 calculated in each energy band ( at a given epoch ) should match to within the limits set by the poisson noise ( i.e. the fractional rms spectrum should be constant to within the uncertainties given by the above equation ) .",
    "differences in @xmath0 significantly larger than these would indicate that the source variability amplitude is a function of energy .",
    "this would then mean the psd amplitude / shape is different in different energy bands , or there are multiple spectral components that vary independently .",
    "the above uncertainty estimates can be used to test the hypothesis that the source variability is achromatic .",
    "if significant differences between energy bands are detected ( as in the case of  presented below ) then these errors should not be used to fit the rms spectrum .",
    "the assumption that the differences are due only to measurement errors is no longer the case . in such situations",
    "the light curves in adjacent energy bands are likely to be partially correlated and so @xmath24-fitting of the rms spectrum is not appropriate .",
    "the differences in excess variance will be a combination of intrinsic differences and measurement errors .",

    "for example , when observing the spectrum of a constant source one expects repeatability of the data to within the limits set by measurement errors , i.e. each new realisation of the spectrum should be consistent within the errors . in agn variability analysis",

    "real changes in the psd would indicate genuine non - stationarity and reflect real changes in the physical conditions of the variability process .",

    "a different issue is that differences between the variance of simultaneous light curves obtained in different energy bands can be examined using the excess variance ( or @xmath95 ) statistic .",
    "it is possible to estimate the uncertainty in the excess variance due to errors in the flux measurements .",
    "this uncertainty , accounting only for measurement ( e.g. poisson ) errors , can be used when testing for spectral variability , as demonstrated in section  [ sect : mrk766 ] .",
    "estimators such as the excess variance provide a useful , if crude , means of quantifying the variability of agn .",

    "various possible uses of these are presented and some possible problems with their significance and interpretation are brought to light .",
    "the primary issues are as follows :    1 .   in order to search for non - stationary variability in an ensemble of short light curves ( or short light curve segments ) one can test whether the individual variances are consistent with their mean .",
    "two practical methods are presented ( sections  [ sect : bin_var ] and [ sect : sim_table ] ) .",
    "2 .   in the first method",
    "the mean variance and its error are calculated at various epochs by binning the individual variance estimates .",
    "this is most useful when searching for subtle changes in variability amplitude but requires large datasets ( in order that the variance can be sufficiently averaged ) .",
    "3 .   in the second method",
    "the individual variance estimates are compared with the expected scatter around the mean .",
    "the expected scatter is calculated using monte carlo simulations of stationary processes .",
    "the table gives some examples of the scatter expected for various psd shapes typical of agn .",
    "this table can therefore be used to provide a ` quick look ' at whether the observed fluctuations in the variance are larger than expected .",
    "one drawback is that , because the intrinsic scatter in the variance is rather large for red noise data , this method is only sensitive to very large changes in the variability amplitude .",
    "another drawback is that one has to assume a shape for the psd .",
    "4 .   the excess variance can also be used to quantify how the variance changes as a function of energy ( section  [ sect : spec_var ] ) .",
    "an approximate formula is presented ( based on the results of monte carlo simulations ) that gives the expected error in the excess variance resulting from only observation uncertainties ( flux errors such as poisson noise ) .",
    "this can be used to test for significant differences in variance between energy bands .",
    "if the normalised excess variances ( or @xmath125s ) are found to differ significantly between energy bands this implies the psd is energy dependent and/or there are independently varying spectral components .",
    "possibly the most robust yet practical approach to variability analysis from agn data is to test the validity of hypotheses using monte carlo simulations .",

    "this is the normalisation most often used in analysis of agn and x - ray binaries because the integrated periodogram yields the fractional variance of the data .",

    "the factor of @xmath135 accounts for aliasing of the poisson noise level if the original photon counting signal contained gaps .",
    "if the light curve is a series of contiguous time bins ( i.e. @xmath136 ) and has zero background ( which is approximately true for many _ xmm - newton _  light curves of agn ) then this reduces to @xmath137 .",

    "steps 2 and 3 were repeated , using the same true light curve , to obtain the distribution of @xmath106 .",
    "[ fig : fvar_dist2 ] shows some results . in this example",

    "it should also be noted that the distributions are quite symmetrically centred on the correct value , indicating that @xmath106 is an unbiased estimator of the intrinsic variance in the light curve , even in relatively low s / n data .    in order to assess how the error on @xmath106 changes with s / n",
    ", the width of its distribution was measured from simulated data at various different settings of s / n and intrinsic variance ( i.e. @xmath42 ) .",

    "that no particular realisation adversely affect the outcome , and to increase the statistics , this was repeated for @xmath91 different random light curves ( of the same fractional variance ) and the width of the @xmath106 distributions were averaged ( i.e. the whole cycle of steps 13 was repeated @xmath91 times ) .",
