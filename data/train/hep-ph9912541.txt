    "the standard model ( sm ) ,  @xcite based on the gauge group @xmath0 , has proven very robust , with all precision electroweak data in excellent agreement with the predictions of the theory .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , there remain important open questions in the sm .",
    "chief among them is the mechanism which causes the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath1 to @xmath2 and the nature of the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath3the fermi scale .",
    "although the size of @xmath4 @xmath5 is known , its precise origin is yet unclear .    to understand some of the issues involved",
    ", it proves useful to examine the simplest example of symmetry breakdown in which the symmetry breaking is effected by just one complex higgs doublet @xmath6 in @xmath7 . in this case , the fermi scale @xmath4 enters directly as a scale parameter in the higgs potential @xmath8 ^ 2~.\\ ] ] the sign of the @xmath9 term is chosen to guarantee that @xmath10 will be asymmetric , with a minimum at a non - zero value for @xmath11 .",
    "this triggers the breakdown of @xmath1 to @xmath2 , since it forces @xmath6 to develop a non - zero vev : as the surviving @xmath12 in the breakdown . ]",
    "@xmath13    because @xmath4 is an internal scale in the potential @xmath10 , in isolation it clearly makes no sense to ask what physics fixes the scale of @xmath4 .",
    "this question , however , can be asked if one considers the sm as an effective theory valid up to some very high cut - off scale @xmath14 , where new physics comes in . in this broader context",
    "it makes sense to ask what is the relation of @xmath4 to the cut - off @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , because the @xmath15 theory is trivial ,  @xcite with the only consistent theory being one where @xmath16 , considering the scalar interactions in @xmath7 without some high energy cut - off is not sensible .    to appreciate this point ,",
    "let s compute the evolution of the coupling constant @xmath17 from the renormalization group equation ( rge ) @xmath18 this equation , in contrast to what happens in qcd , has a positive rather than a negative sign in front of its first term , so @xmath17 grows with @xmath19 . as a result ,",
    "if one solves the rge , including only this first term , one finds a singularity at large @xmath19 which is a reflection of this growth @xmath20 of course , one can not trust the location of the , so called , landau pole  @xcite derived from eq .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath21~,\\ ] ] since eq .",
    "( 3 ) stops being valid when @xmath17 gets too large .",
    "nevertheless , for any given cut - off @xmath22 , one * can * predict @xmath23 for scales @xmath19 sufficiently below this cut - off . indeed , the @xmath15 theory is perfectly sensible as long as one restricts oneself to @xmath24 .",
    "if one wants to push the cut - off to infinity , however , one sees that @xmath25 .",
    "this is the statement of triviality ,  @xcite within this simplified context .    in the case of the sm",
    ", one can  measure \" where the cut - off @xmath22 is in @xmath7 from the value of the higgs mass . using the potential ( 2 )",
    "one finds that @xmath26 physics is rather different depending on whether the higgs mass is light or is heavy with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath27 is light the effective theory described by @xmath7 is very reliable , and * weakly coupled * , with @xmath28 up to very high scales . in these circumstances",
    "it is meaningful to ask whether the large hierarchy @xmath29 is a stable condition .",
    "this question , following t hooft ,  @xcite is often called the problem of * naturalness*.    if , on the other hand , the higgs mass is heavy , of order of the cut - off @xmath30 , then it is pretty clear that @xmath7 as an effective theory stops making sense .",
    "the coupling @xmath17 is so strong that one can not separate the particle - like excitations from the cut - off itself .",
    "numerical investigations on the lattice  @xcite have indicated that this occurs when @xmath31 in this case , it is clear that @xmath32 , as the order parameter of the symmetry breakdown , must be replaced by something else .",
    "the planck scale @xmath33 is clearly a natural physical cutoff .",
    "so , in the weak coupling case , one has to worry whether the hierarchy @xmath34 is stable .",
    "it turns out that this is * not * the case , since radiative effects in a theory with a cutoff destabilize any pre - existing hierarchy .",
    "indeed , this was t hooft s original argument .",
    "@xcite quantities like the higgs mass that are * not protected * by symmetries suffer quadratic mass shifts .",
    "schematically , the higgs mass shifts from the value given in eq .",
    "( 6 ) to @xmath35 it follows from eq .",
    "( 8) that if @xmath36 , the higgs boson can not remain light . if one wants the higgs to remain light one is invited to look for some protective symmetry to guarantee that the hierarchy @xmath37 is stable .",
    "does not explain why such a hierarchy exists .",
    "]    such a protective symmetry exists  it is supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "@xcite susy is a boson - fermion symmetry in which bosonic degrees of freedom are paired with fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "if supersymmetry is exact then the masses of the fermions and of their bosonic partners are the same . in a supersymmetric version of the standard model",
    "all quadratic divergences cancel .",
    "thus parameters like the higgs boson mass will not be sensitive to a high energy cut - off . via supersymmetry the higgs boson mass",
    "is kept light since its fermionic partner has a mass protected by a chiral symmetry .    because one has not seen any of the susy partners of the states in the sm yet ,",
    "it is clear that if a supersymmetric extension of the sm exists then the associated supersymmetry must be broken .",
    "remarkably , even if susy is broken the naturalness problem in the sm is resolved , provided that the splitting between the fermion - boson susy partners is itself of @xmath38 .",
    "for example , the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass due to a @xmath39-loop is moderated into only a logarithmic divergence by the presence of a loop of winos , the spin-1/2 partners of the @xmath39 bosons .",
    "schematically , in the susy case , eq .",
    "( 8) gets replaced by @xmath40 so , as long as the masses of the susy partners ( denoted by a tilde ) are themselves not split away by much more than @xmath4 , radiative corrections will not destabilize the hierarchy @xmath41 .",
    "let me recapitulate .",
    "theoretical considerations regarding the nature of the fermi scale have suggested two alternatives for new physics associated with the @xmath42 breakdown :    \\i ) @xmath7 is the lagrangian of some elementary scalar fields interacting together via an asymmetric potential , whose minimum is set by the fermi scale @xmath4 .",
    "the presence of non - vanishing vevs triggers the electroweak breakdown .",
    "however , to guarantee the naturalness of the hierarchy @xmath37 , both @xmath7 and the whole sm lagrangian must be augmented by other fields and interactions so as to be ( at least approximately ) supersymmetric .",
    "obviously , if this alternative is true , there is plenty of new physics to be discovered , since all particles have superpartners of mass @xmath43 .",
    "\\ii ) the symmetry breaking sector of the sm has itself a dynamical cut - off of @xmath38 . in this case",
    ", it makes no sense to describe @xmath7 in terms of strongly coupled scalar fields .",
    "rather , @xmath7 describes a dynamical theory of some new strongly interacting fermions @xmath44 , whose condensates cause the @xmath42 breakdown .",
    "the strong interactions which form the condensates @xmath45 also identify the fermi scale as the dynamical scale of the underlying theory , very much analogous to @xmath46 . if this alternative turns out to be true , then one expects also to see lots of new physics , connected with these new strong interactions , when one probes them at energies of @xmath38 .",
    "the expectations of the sm , assuming the simplest form of symmetry breaking , have been confronted experimentally to high accuracy .",
    "these results provide already some important indications on the nature of the electroweak symmetry breakdown , which i review here . in practice , since all fermions but the top are quite light compared to the scale of the @xmath39 and @xmath47-bosons , all quantities in this simplest version of the sm are specified as functions of 5 parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath4 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "it proves convenient to trade the first three of these for another triplet of quantities which are better measured : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "once one has adopted a set of * standard parameters * then all physical measurable quantities can be expressed as a function of this  standard set \" . because @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , as well as @xmath51 to better than 3% : @xmath55 gev .",
    "@xcite ] are rather accurately known , all sm fits essentially constrain only * one * unknown the higgs mass @xmath50 .",
    "this constraint , however , is not particularly strong because all radiative effects depends on @xmath50 only logarithmically .",
    "the result of the sm fit of all precision data gives for the higgs mass  @xcite @xmath56 and the 95% c.l .",
    "upper bound : @xmath57 .",
    "it is particularly gratifying that this fit indicates the need for a light higgs boson , since this ",
    "solution \" is what is internally consistent .",
    "furthermore , this result is also compatible with the limit on @xmath27 coming from direct searches for the higgs boson in the process @xmath58 at lep 200 .",
    "the limit given at the 1999 lepton photon conference at slac is ,  @xcite at 95% c.l .",
    ", @xmath59 by running lep 200 at @xmath60 gev in the coming year one opens up another 10 gev of discovery potential for the higgs boson .",
    "the present tevatron bounds for @xmath27 are weaker , being roughly a factor of 20 - 50 too insensitive for @xmath61 gev . however , with the substantial luminosity increased planned , the tevatron can explore a higgs window up to @xmath27 = 110 - 130 gev ,  @xcite before the turn - on of the lhc .",
    "the lhc , of course , has the capability of exploring the full range for @xmath50 , well beyond the upper bound estimate ( 7 ) .",
    "the physical lower bound ( 11 ) suffices to rule out the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis within the context of this simplest version of the sm . to allow for electroweak baryogenesis",
    "it is necessary that the @xmath1 phase transition be strongly first order .",
    "@xcite only in this case can one prevent having the ( b+l)-violating interactions in the sm going back into equilibrium after the electroweak phase transition , thereby erasing any matter asymmetry established during the phase transition .",
    "one can show that to prevent erasing the established asymmetry one needs the order parameter at the phase transition to have a value @xmath62 .",
    "such a large jump in the higgs vev , however , only occurs for relatively light higgs boson masses  typically @xmath63 50 gev ,  @xcite with @xmath64 decreasing rather rapidly as @xmath27 increases .    within the context of this simplest version of the sm one",
    "expects @xmath27 to be larger than the bound ( 11 ) from the requirement of vacuum stability .",
    "the argument is rather simple .",
    "because top is rather heavy , in the rge for the higgs coupling @xmath17 one can not neglect the effect of the top yukawa coupling .",
    "thus , instead of eq .",
    "( 3 ) one has @xmath65 + \\ldots\\ ] ] because the top contribution comes with a * negative * sign , it will slow down and can actually reverse the growth of @xmath17 . indeed ,",
    "if the higgs coupling @xmath66 is not large enough , because the higgs boson is light , the contribution coming from the @xmath67 term can drive @xmath17 * negative * at some scale @xmath68 .",
    "this can not happen physically , because for @xmath69 the higgs potential is unbounded !    to avoid this vacuum instability below some cut - off @xmath22 one needs to have @xmath66 , and therefore the higgs mass , sufficiently large .",
    "hence , these considerations give a lower bound for the higgs mass .",
    "taking @xmath70 , this lower bound is  @xcite @xmath71 lowering the cut - off @xmath22 , weakens the bound on @xmath50 .",
    "interestingly , to have a sm higgs as light as 100 gev which is the region accessible to lep 200 and the tevatron requires a very low cut - off , of order @xmath72 tev .",
    "@xcite    of course , a good fit of the data with the minimal sm does not necessarily exclude possible extensions of the sm involving either new particles or new interactions , provided that these new particles and/or interactions give only small effects .",
    "typically , the effects of new physics are small if the excitations associated with this new physics have mass scales several times the @xmath39-mass",
    ". one can quantify the above discussion in a more precise way by introducing a general parametrization for the vacuum polarization tensors of the gauge bosons and the @xmath73 vertex .",
    "these are the places where the dominant electroweak radiative corrections occur and therefore are the quantities which are most sensitive to new physics .",
    "@xcite as an illustration , i will discuss an example which has a bearing on the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "there are four distinct vacuum polarization contributions @xmath74 , where the pairs @xmath75 @xmath76 . for sufficiently low values of the momentum transfer",
    "@xmath77 it obviously suffices to expand @xmath74 only up to @xmath78 .",
    "thus , approximately , one needs to consider 8 different parameters associated with these contributions : @xmath79 in fact , there are not really 8 independent parameters since electromagnetic gauge invariance requires that @xmath80 .",
    "of the 6 remaining parameters one can fix 3 combinations of coefficients in terms of @xmath81 and @xmath53 .",
    "hence , in a most general analysis , the gauge field vacuum polarization tensors ( for @xmath82 ) only involve 3 arbitrary parameters .",
    "the usual choice,@xcite is to have one of these contain the main quadratic @xmath51dependence , leaving the other two essentially independent of @xmath51 . in the notation of altarelli and barbieri , the parameter that depends on @xmath51",
    "is called @xmath83 , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 being at most logarithmically dependent on this mass . for our purpose ,",
    "the interesting parameter is @xmath85 , whose value , obtained from a fit of all precision electroweak data , turns out to be @xcite @xmath86    given some assumption of how @xmath1 is broken down , one can estimate the various @xmath87 parameters .",
    "this is somewhat harder to do in theories where the spontaneous breakdown occurs dynamically , since these involve strong interactions in the symmetry breaking sector .",
    "nevertheless , one can estimate @xmath85 in a dynamical symmetry breaking theory , if one assumes that the spectrum of such a theory , and its dynamics , is qcd - like.@xcite from its definition @xmath85 involves the difference between the spectral functions of vector and axial vector currents this difference has two components in a dynamical symmetry breaking theory .",
    "there is a contribution from a heavy higgs boson @xmath88 characteristic of such theories , plus a term detailing the differences between the vector and axial vector spectral functions .",
    "this second component reflects the spectrum of the underlying theory which causes the symmetry breakdown . the first piece is readily computed from the sm expression , using @xmath89 .",
    "the second piece , in a qcd - like theory , can be estimated , modulo some counting factors .",
    "one finds  @xcite @xmath90 \\times",
    "10^{-3}~.\\ ] ] the second term follows if the underlying theory is qcd - like , so that the resonance spectrum is saturated by @xmath91-like and @xmath92-like , resonances . here",

    " technicolors \" in this theory . and @xmath95 .",
    "] using eq .",
    "( 16 ) and taking @xmath96 , as is usually assumed , one sees that @xmath97 these values for @xmath85 are , respectively , @xmath98 and @xmath99 away from the best fit value of @xmath85 .",
    "obviously , one can not countenance anymore a dynamical symmetry breaking theory which is qcd - like !",
    "nothing as disastrous occurs instead if one considers a supersymmetric extension of the sm , provided the superpartners are not too light .",
    "1 , taken from a recent analysis of altarelli , barbieri , and caravaglios,@xcite shows a typical fit , scanning over a range of parameters in the mssm  the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "although the mssm improves the @xmath100 of the fit over that for the sm ( which is already very good ! ) , these improvements are small and one can not use this as evidence for low energy supersymmetry .",
    "an indirect piece of evidence favoring the existence of supersymmetry at the weak scale is the way the @xmath101 coupling constants evolve with energy .",
    "although these couplings are quite different at low energy , they evolve differently with @xmath19 . in leading order , the rge @xmath102 imply a logarithmic change for the inverse couplings .",
    "the rate of change of the coupling constants with energy is governed by the coefficients @xmath103 which enter in the rge . in turn , these coefficients depend on the * matter content * of the theory  which matter states are  active \" at the scale one is probing",
    ". remarkably , with ordinary matter , one gets near * unification * of couplings at high energy .",
    "however , assuming that there are supersymmetric partners of ordinary matter present above the fermi scale , the three sm couplings really unify , as shown in fig .",
    "2 !    the unification of the couplings in the susy sm case is quite spectacular .",
    "however , _ per se _ , this is only suggestive .",
    "it is neither a  proof \" that a low energy supersymmetry exists , nor does it mean that there exists some high energy grand unified theory ( gut ) which breaks down to the sm at a high scale .",
    "the proof of the former requires the discovery of the predicted susy partners , while for guts one must find typical phenomena which are associated with these theories  like proton decay .",
    "nevertheless , if such a gut exists , one learns that the unification scale is rather high in the supersymmetric case [ @xmath104 gev ] .",
    "such high scales gives unobservedly long lifetimes for proton decay arising from @xmath105 @xmath106 operators , since this lifetime scales as @xmath107 .",
    "in susy guts , however , one has dangerous @xmath108 operators where two quarks are replaced by squarks resulting in a @xmath109 operator .",
    "these terms lead to rather rapid proton decay , unless they are suitably suppressed . as a result ,",
    "the predictions of susy gut models for proton decay are rather model - dependent , with modes involving strangeness in the final state , like @xmath110 , dominating.@xcite for these reasons the existing bounds on proton decay  @xcite only serve to constrain parameters and can not be adduced either for or against supersymmetry .    much the same comments can be made regarding more careful calculations of the evolution of the sm couplings , including both 2-loop effects and more detailed susy thresholds .",
    "it turns out that the results of these more refined calculations , assuming a high scale unification of couplings , do not quite give the correct value of @xmath111 , unless one assumes a rather high average susy threshold @xmath112 tev .",
    "@xcite however , this is probably not a serious problem , since one could well imagine being able to lower @xmath113 as a result of a few percent correction to the evolution equations coming from , difficult to pin down , gut thresholds .",
    "@xcite      supersymmetry associates bosonic partners to fermions and _ vice versa_. however , it also requires two higgs doublets , since the superpotential which describes a susy extension of the yukawa interactions in the sm can only contain chiral superfields and not their adjoint .",
    "although @xmath114 has the same quantum number as @xmath115 , supersymmetry does not allow this more parsimonious choice . as a result",
    ", all supersymmetric extensions of the sm necessarily imply the presence of 5 physical higgs states .",

    "in fact , because more complicated supersymmetric extensions of the sm ( e.g. those obtained by including additional gauge singlet higgs superfields  @xcite ) retain the same qualitative features , probing in detail the higgs spectrum is a very effective way to test the whole notion of the existence of an approximate supersymmetry at the weak scale .",
    "although the susy sm is rather predictive when it comes to the higgs sector , beyond this sector the spectrum of susy partners and possible allowed interactions is quite model dependent .",
    "most supersymmetric extensions of the sm considered are assumed to contain a discrete symmetry , @xmath154-parity , which is conserved .",

    ", the other principal difference between sugra and gauge mediated models of supersymmetry breaking is the assumed form of the soft breaking terms . in sugra models , to avoid fcnc problems , one needs to assume that the soft breaking terms are * universal*. this assumption is unnecessary in gauge mediated models , where in fact one can explicitly compute the form of the soft breaking terms and show that they do not lead to fcnc .    the search strategies and the resulting bounds on sparticles are quite model - dependent .",

    "@xcite thus the lightest chargino decays always to the lowest neutralino and this state in turn radiatively decays to the gravitino lsp . at the tevatron , therefore , if one produces charginos , these would typically produce decays with two photons and missing energy from the chain @xmath173 .",

    ", i will describe these bounds for the mssm , when the susy symmetry breaking is assumed to have a sugra origin .",
    "this scenario is characterized by just a few universal parameters , which include a common scalar mass @xmath174 and a universal gaugino mass @xmath175 , at scales of order @xmath176 . given these inputs , one can then derive the spectrum of the susy states , essentially by using the rge evolution from @xmath176 to the weak scale . in this model at low energy the ratio of gaugino masses follows the ratio of the gauge coupling constants , so that @xmath177 this pattern is quite different from that which obtains if the supersymmetry breaking at large scales is mediated by scale anomalies , as suggested recently by randall and sundrum.@xcite in this latter case @xmath178 and thus @xmath179 obviously the phenomenology is also quite different , since now @xmath180 .    for the mssm with the simplest universal sugra breaking , not surprisingly the best bounds for the strongly interacting sparticles [ squarks , @xmath181 , and gluinos , @xmath182 come from the tevatron , while lep 200 gives the best bounds for weakly interacting sparticles [ sleptons , @xmath183 , and weak gauginos , both @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "typically , for @xmath186 the mass limits are above 250 gev for squarks and gluinos  @xcite . for the sleptons , the lep limits are near half the cm energy , with the most recent analysis giving , at the 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite @xmath187    the stop limits are a special case . because of the large top mass there can be sizable @xmath145 mixing , so that the stop eigenvalues can have large splittings .",
    "the lightest stop , @xmath188 , can be searched for at lep 200 , as well as at the tevatron where it can either be pair produced , or can originate from top decay : @xmath189 .  @xcite",
    "the lep 200 stop bounds are ( slightly ) dependent on the @xmath145 mixing angle .",
    "the tevatron bound , on the other hand , is quite strong provided that the lsp is light @xmath190 , and one finds , at 95% c.l . @xmath191",
    "both this bound , as well as the lep 200 bounds , are shown in fig .",
    "4 .      the bounds on @xmath150 and on the lighest stop state are quite relevant to the whole issue of electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "this is because if one has a rather light stop this helps make the electroweak phase transition more strongly first order , @xcite thereby ameliorating the need for having a very light higgs .",
    "one can understand this qualitatively as follows .",
    "a light stop modifies significantly the coefficient of the * cubic * term in the higgs effective potential is the effective scalar field describing the electroweak phase transition in the model .",
    "it is an open question whether , for the purposes of discussing the electroweak phase transition , it really suffices to reduce the multi - higgs susy potential in this manner . ]",
    "@xmath192 because @xmath193 if @xmath194 is larger this allows @xmath195 , and hence the higgs mass , to be larger for a given jump in the higgs vev at the phase transition .    in practice",
    ", however , one must be careful with what goes on with the rest of the higgs potential . in particular",
    ", one must make sure that the relaxation of the higgs bound occurs in a region of parameter space where ther is * no * charge or color breaking minima .",
    "fig . 5 , adapted from a paper by carena , quiros and wagner ,  @xcite shows the region in the @xmath196 plane for which @xmath197 given the present bounds on @xmath150 and @xmath198",
    ", there appears to be little phase space still allowed , particularly if one excludes the cosmologically troubling possibility of having a two - step electroweak phase transition .",
    "of couse , this graph is somewhat misleading because it projects all the existing parameter space onto the @xmath199 plane .",
    "in addition , one should remember that the @xmath198 bounds where obtained under some assumptions e.g. that @xmath20050 gev and that the lightest stop decayed 100% of the time via @xmath201 . nevertheless , taking fig .",
    "5 at face value , the allowed region is rather small .",
    "furthermore , particularly the large @xmath198 piece slice has other problems , since large @xmath198 goes hand in hand with low @xmath202 , which is not favored by the susy higgs searches .",
    "given the above , it is not inconceivable to me that , even before the turn - on of the lhc .",
    "one may shut the window for electroweak baryogenesis also in the mssm .    of course",
    ", the non erasure of the matter asymmetry produced at the electroweak phase transition is only a * necessary condition * for electroweak baryogenesis . one needs also be able to produce a sufficient asymmetry during the phase transition ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath204 depends crucially on the strength of the cp violation associated with baryon - violating processes . in this respect ,",
    "supersymmetric theories have an advantage , since it is possible to have cp - violating phases which are * flavor conserving*. an example of such a phase is that associated with the parameter @xmath205 in the susy - preserving higgs superpotential @xmath206 .",
    "another example is the phase entering in the susy - breaking gaugino mass @xmath207 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath204 in susy models in the literature typically requires that the cp - violating phase which enters in establishing the asymmetry is not too small  typically , @xmath208",
    "it is not clear , however , whether such largish susy cp phases are in contradiction with the bounds one obtains on these phases from the neutron dipole moment , @xmath209 ,  @xcite since @xmath210 and @xmath211 are not simply related to each other .",
    "precision meausurements of the z - line shape now determine the number of light neutrinos species to a very high accuracy much greater that that which can be obtained from nucleosynthesis .",
    "the value of @xmath212 extracted from the combined data of all four lep experiments ,  @xcite @xmath213 gives very strong evidence that there exist only three families of quarks and leptons .",
    "although the result on @xmath212 is remarkable , the most exciting news from neutrinos in the last year is the evidence coming from superkamiokande  @xcite for neutrino oscillations . in a simple 2-neutrino description ,  @xcite",
    "the superkamiokande results are consistent with * maximun mixing * and a mass - squared difference in the milli - e@xmath214 range : @xmath215    the superkamiokande evidence for neutrino masses already has important implications since it gives a * lower bound * on some neutrino mass : @xmath216 .",
    "this mass value , in turn , gives a lower bound for the cosmological contribution of neutrinos to the universe s energy density : @xmath217 although this number is far from that needed for closure of the universe , the contribution of neutrinos to @xmath218 is comparable to that of luminous matter , @xmath219 .",
    "@xcite    for particle physics , a value of @xmath220 is also quite interesting , since it provides the best evidence for `` new physics '' to date . because neutrinos are neutral",
    ", one can write different type of mass terms for them :  @xcite    @xmath221 - \\frac{1}{2 } [ \\overline{\\nu_{\\rm r}}\\tilde c m_s\\overline{\\nu_{\\rm r}}^t + \\nu^t_{\\rm r } \\tilde cm^\\dagger_s\\nu_{\\rm r } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2}[\\nu_{\\rm l}^t\\tilde cm_t\\nu_{\\rm l } + \\overline{\\nu_{\\rm l}}\\tilde c m_t^\\dagger\\overline{\\nu_{\\rm l}}^t]~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath222 is a charge conjugation matrix and the mass matrices @xmath223 are lorentz scalars .",
    "however , their presence is only possible as a result of different symmetry breakdowns .",
    "specifically , @xmath224 , often called a dirac mass , conserves fermion number , but violates @xmath1 since it does not transform as an @xmath225 doublet .",
    "clearly @xmath224 is proportional to the fermi scale @xmath4 and is similar to the mass terms that gets induced for quarks and charged leptons , after the electroweak breakdown .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of this matrix should be of the same order as those of the quarks and charged leptons .",
    "both @xmath226 and @xmath227 violate fermion number by two units and are known as majorana masses . because @xmath226 couples @xmath228 with itself , clearly it is an @xmath1 invariant .",
    "thus the eigenstates of @xmath226 are totally unconstrained and are new parameters in the theory .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath227 , which violates @xmath1 because it does not transform as an @xmath225 triplet . naively , because of its transformation law under @xmath1",
    ", one would expect the eigenvalues of this matrix to scale as @xmath229 , with @xmath14 again being a new parameter in the theory .    because the neutrino masses inferred from the superkamiokande experiment are in the sub - ev range , and hence much less than @xmath230 and @xmath231 , it is clear that the neutrino majorana mass terms must play a role .",
    "hence one learns that not only individual lepton number , but also total lepton number must be violated .",
    "if one assumes that there are no right handed neutrinos , then the neutrino mass matrix is only @xmath227 and one can write for @xmath232 the formula @xmath233 using the superkamiokande result , @xmath14 is clearly a very high scale : @xmath234 gev a scale of the order of the gut scale !    alternatively , if @xmath235 exists ( and one neglects @xmath227 ) , then the neutrino mass matrix reads simply  @xcite @xmath236 if the eigenvalues of @xmath226 are large , then m has two eigenmatrices , given approximately by @xmath226 and @xmath237 . in this case",
    ", the spectrum splits into a very heavy neutrino sector and a very light neutrino sector .",
    "this , so called , * see - saw mechanism * is very suggestive . for any neutrino ,",
    "it is natural to expect that the eigenvalues of @xmath224 should be of the order of the corresponding charged lepton mass .",
    "hence one expects @xmath238 .",
    "again , to fit the superkamiokande result requires that there be a large mass scale , now associated with the right - handed neutrinos : @xmath239 gev .",
    "these considerations clearly point to new physics at very large scales , of order of @xmath240 gev , associated with broken lepton number .",
    "this has suggested alternative scenarios for establishing the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "@xcite this asymmetry could originate from a primordial lepton asymmetry established at temperatures of the order of the scale of lepton number violation .",
    "since ( b+l ) processes eventually come into equilibrium in the early universe , this primordial lepton asymmetry can get transmuted into a baryon asymmetry .",
    "remarkably , in this scenario , the cp - violating phases in the neutrino sector are the root cause of our existence !",
    "eventhough the sm continues to give an excellent description of the precision electroweak data , the question of the origin of the fermi scale argues for new physics at , or below , the tev scale .",
    "the most likely form of this new physics , in the view of many , is the presence of an approximate supersymmetry , with spartners which could be as light as 100 gev .",
    "perhaps most interestingly , such a low energy supersymmetry has important implications for cosmology .",
    "it provides both an interesting candidate for dark matter in the lsp and it may actually make possible baryogenesis at the electroweak scale .    that there is physics beyond the sm has been made clear by the observation of neutrino oscillations .",
    "however , this new physics appears to be associated with scales much above the fermi scale , involving the breakdown of lepton number . nevertheless , these phenomena could also have important implications for cosmology . at any rate",
    "they indicate already that neutrinos , although they probably do not dominate the universe s energy density , give a non negligible contribution to this density .",
