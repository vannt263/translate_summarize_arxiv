    "@xmath13 is an @xmath14-punctured riemann sphere , and the projection @xmath15 induces the embedding @xmath16 .",
    "the covering transformation group of @xmath17 is the cyclic group @xmath18 , so that , quasiconformal deformations of @xmath13 correspond to periodic quasiconformal deformations of @xmath0 with only a period @xmath19 .",
    "then it is shown from mcmullen s theorem in @xcite that @xmath20 is totally geodesic for the teichmller metric .",
    "by contrast , the embedding of @xmath21 into @xmath4 is not totally geodesic ( cf . the kra ",

    "additionally , @xmath22 is considered to be one of the smallest riemann surface which has the above properties , that is , there exists no riemann surface except @xmath0 which is covered by @xmath0 and covers @xmath13 for all @xmath8 .",
    "thus , in this paper , we would like to investigate quasiconformal deformations of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we shall try to find all riemann surfaces which are quasiconformally equivalent to @xmath0 .",

    "in fact , if @xmath2 is quasiconformally equivalent to @xmath0 , then @xmath2 is conformally equivalent to @xmath23 by a certain closed discrete subset @xmath24 ( cf .",
    "the removable singularity theorem , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "henceforth , we say that two subsets @xmath25 are quasiconformally equivalent if there exists a quasiconformal self - homeomorphism of @xmath26 which maps @xmath27 onto @xmath28 .",

    "further he completely characterized subsets which is quasiconformally equivalent to @xmath33 by several conditions of the euclidean geometry .",
    "+ first , when we take the macmanus proof into consideration , it seems significant to solve our problem for @xmath34 contained in the real line . in this particular case",

    "3 .   there exists @xmath40 such that the following inequality holds for all @xmath41 ; @xmath42    the last condition derives from the concept of @xmath43-quasisymmetry .",
    "theorem [ lem ] ( proved in section [ lemma ] ) shows that if @xmath34 lying on the real line is quasiconformally equivalent to @xmath31 , then @xmath27 can not be bounded from above and below .",
    "therefore the assumption in theorem [ thmb ] is necessarily required .",
    "further theorem [ thmb ] completely characterizes the subsets of @xmath1 which are quasiconformally equivalent to @xmath31 .",
    "+ next , we observe @xmath34 whose compliment has an automorphism of infinite order . in this case , we obtain the next theorem .",

    "the assumption for @xmath27 in theorem [ thma ] means that @xmath23 has an automorphism of infinite order @xmath48 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath23 has an automorphism of infinite order , we may assume @xmath27 satisfies the assumption in theorem [ thma ] by composing certain affine transformation .",
