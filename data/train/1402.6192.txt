    "these brightening phenomena are often called `` outburst '' .",

    "the temporal variations of polarization angle ( pa ) indicate that no rotation event occurred during this outburst .",

    "we monitored 3c  454.3 by multi - band photopolarimetry from july 2007 to january 2011 ( jd  24546182455590 ) .",
    "the monitoring was performed in the optical and nir bands by attaching trispec @xcite and howpol @xcite to the 1.5-m kanata telescope at the higashi - hiroshima observatory .",
    "trispec enables simultaneous photopolarimetric observations in the optical band and two nir bands .",
    "howpol can also make photopolarimetric measurements in the optical band .",
    "unfortunately during the entire monitoring period , one channel ( ir-2 ) of the two nir arrays and an optical ccd of the trispec were at times not available because of readout errors .",
    "we compensated for the lack of optical data by using the howpol .",
    "thus , we measured the @xmath7- and @xmath8-band photopolarimetry at the same time .",
    "an observation sequence unit consisted of successive exposures with a half - wave plate set at four different angles .",
    "the polarization for the given observation sequence unit was derived from the set of four exposures .",
    "we adjusted the integration time depending on the sky conditions and the brightness of the object .",
    "typical integration times were 170  s in both bands .",
    "for all images , the bias and dark were subtracted and the image field was flattened before performing the aperture photometry . by comparing with star  13 listed in @xcite , which appeared in the same frame as 3c  454.3 , we were able to conduct differential photometry . for star  13 , we used the magnitudes @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite , and ( for 3c  454.3 ) we adopted a galactic extinction of 0.349 and 0.097  mag in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands , respectively @xcite .",
    "we converted the observed magnitudes into fluxes by referring to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we confirmed that the instrumental polarization of trispec was less than 0.1  % in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands by using the unpolarized standard stars .",
    "thus , we did not apply any correction for the instrumental polarization .",
    "however , we applied the instrumental depolarization factors of 0.827 and 0.928 in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands , respectively .",
    "the zero point of the pa was defined by the standard system ( measured from north to east ) by observing the polarized standard stars : hd  19820 and hd  25443 @xcite .",
    "a large instrumental polarization ( @xmath114% ) appears from howpol because of the asymmetric reflection of the incident light from the tertiary mirror of the kanata telescope .",
    "the instrumental polarization can be expressed as a function of a declination of 3c  454.3 and an hour angle at the observation .",
    "we calculate the intrinsic polarization by subtracting the instrumental polarization from the raw polarization .",
    "the deviation of the instrumental polarization is estimated by observing the unpolarized standard stars .",
    "the error from instrumental polarization is less than 0.5@xmath12 , which we calibrate from the deviation .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     using equations  ( [ p_hughes ] ) and ( [ a_hughes ] ) , we derived a constraints on @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the first and second brightenings . because @xmath15 for the first brightening is close to @xmath16 , @xmath17 should be 90@xmath0 according to equation  ( [ p_hughes ] ) . in this case , @xmath18 as the first order of approximation . the doppler factor , @xmath19^{-1}$ ] where @xmath20 , should be equal to @xmath13 .",
    "we can calculate the limits of the parameters for @xmath13 and @xmath14 by using equations  ( [ p_hughes ] ) and ( [ a_hughes ] ) and using the ratio @xmath21 for the second brightening with the highest case of @xmath22 and at the observed maximum pd for comparison . the curves in figure  [ para ] show the upper limits for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 should fall below these lines because @xmath23 .",
    "the open triangle shows the parameter for @xmath13 and @xmath14 adopted by @xcite , which is estimated from the multi - wavelength sed from radio to gamma - ray bands around the 2010 outburst .",
    "the adopted parameters for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the outburst considered by @xcite is excluded from the acceptable parameter space estimated from @xmath24 and @xmath25 . as much as we do nt know the origin of the long - term component ,",
    "if we apply the shocked jet model to the case of @xmath26 for the first and second brightenings , the acceptable parameter space of @xmath13 and @xmath14 can allow the parameter for @xmath13 and @xmath14 adopted by @xcite .",
    "although the timescale of the rapid brightenings was several days , the 2010 outburst lasted two months .",
    "the rapid brightenings were faster than the entire variation trend of the outburst .",
    "the timescale of variation becomes faster in proportion to @xmath27 .",
    "thus , @xmath27 for the rapid brightenings can be greater than that of the outburst . in our results ,",
    "@xmath13 for the first rapid brightening should equal @xmath27 to explain its high polarization .",
    "thus , @xmath13 for the rapid brightenings can be greater than that of the outburst for these variation timescales .",
    "the emitting region of the rapid brightenings must differ from that of the outburst to explain why the values of @xmath13 for the rapid brightenings were greater than those of the outburst .",
    "pks  2155@xmath28304 , a tev gamma - ray - emitting bl  lac object , varies on the timescale from 3 to 5  minutes in the tev band @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the bulk lorentz factors in the jet must be @xmath2950 to explain this rapid variation .",
    "the lorentz factor clearly exceeds the jet lorentz factors @xmath3010 .",
    "several authors propose jet models to explain this complex situation @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that 3c  454.3 is also involved in two or more components varying on different timescales with different values for @xmath13 .",
    "we monitored blazar 3c  454.3 in the optical and near - infrared bands for approximately four years starting from july 2007 , and we detected two types of variations in 2010 : a large - amplitude outburst occurring on a timescale of @xmath11months and extraordinary rapid brightenings occurring on a timescale of @xmath11days .",
    "these brightenings had three features : ( 1 ) the @xmath31 bands reddened , ( 2 ) the degree of polarization ( pd ) increased in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands , and ( 3 ) the polarization was frequency dependent ( fdp ) .",
    "based on these results , we suggest that the observed polarization vectors can be decomposed into two components , namely long- and short - term components .",
    "we separate the short - term component , estimating the long - term component for the rapid brightenings from the pre- and post - brightening data .",
    "the estimated pd of the short - term component for the rapid brightenings was higher than the observed maximum pd and was close to the theoretical maximum pd .",
    "this result indicates that the short - term emitting regions responsible for the rapid brightenings are different from the long - term emitting region that radiated the outburst .",
    "the blazar fdp gives us important constraints on @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath27 .",
