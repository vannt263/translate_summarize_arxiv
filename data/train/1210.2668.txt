    "for a spin heisenberg model with a long - range magnetic order in its ground state , the linearized spin wave theory with the holstein - primakoff ( hp ) transformation@xcite is a standard approach to obtain the spin wave excitations and other dynamical properties . in the case of a simple magnetic unit cell , namely no more than two spins per cell",

    "we will not diagonalize eq . directly since this yields a set of quadratic equations with at least 36 unknowns , which is unlikely to give an analytical expression .",

    ", we can see that a positive or negative eigenvalue ( @xmath78 ) with eigenvector @xmath58 of eq . is a negative or positive eigenvalue ( @xmath79 ) with eigenvector @xmath80 of eq . .",
    "this directly shows that the spin wave excitations are in double degeneracy .",
    "the hamiltonian is derived from the spin hamiltonian on the assumption of the ground state being in the @xmath2 collinear afm order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mag](d ) ) . as shown above",
    ", the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian may be imaginary .",
    "such a case , if happening , indicates that the @xmath2 collinear afm order is unstable for the spin hamiltonian .",
    "this is similar to the case of imaginary phonon vibration modes , which indicates that the corresponding crystal structure is unstable .",
    "thus we can determine the boundary of a - col phase in the phase diagram of the spin hamiltonian by checking the condition whether the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian being real or not .",
    "figure [ fig : diagram ] shows our calculated phase boundary by the red dashed line , which is quite close to the one given by the classical monte carlo simulations .",
    "the difference between the two is that the afm quantum fluctuations are included in our spin wave calculations but not in the classical monte carlo simulations .    in order to calculate physical quantities ,",
    "we need to know the eigenstates corresponding to the spin wave excitations , which but are not directly @xmath58 and @xmath81 of eqs . and because of the boson s characteristic .",
    "let us denote the eigenvectors corresponding to the positive and negative eigenvalues of eq .",
    "by @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively , with @xmath84 being the branch index of the spin wave excitations .",
    "then the hamiltonian will be diagonalized into @xmath85 after the following linear transformation , @xmath86 the above set of equations can be rewritten in a matrix form as @xmath87 here the six columns of the matrix @xmath88 are nothing but the eigenstates corresponding to the spin wave excitations .      as shown above , @xmath89 just contributes to elastic scattering rather than inelastic scattering since it does not change the number of magnons .",

    "the summation of @xmath104 can be replaced by a two dimensional integral over the whole brillouin zone .",
    "it is well - known that the afm quantum fluctuation is strongly influenced by the spatial dimension and the number of nearest neighbors of a site , namely the coordination number .",
    "there are two kinds of two fe atoms ( sites ) in a magnetic unit cell in afe@xmath0se@xmath1 , one is 2-fe - neighbored and the other is 3-fe - neighbored .",
    "thus we need to calculate the afm quantum fluctuation on these two kinds of sites separately .",
    "moreover , there usually exists small spin - orientation anisotropy in realistic materials . to account for such anisotropy ,",
    "one standard approach is to add the term of @xmath105 into the hamiltonian .",
