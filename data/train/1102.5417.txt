    "one of the interesting phenomena in solid state physics is the existence of edge states on the boundary , the properties of which are distinct from those of the bulk states , and they can play an important role in transport , there are examples showing that system is insulated in the bulk , while conduction can be allowed by edge states on the boundary .",
    "the most prominent ones are the quantum hall effect ( qhe)@xcite and the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe)@xcite , where the quantization of a hall conductance is tightly associated with the edge states@xcite .    the realization of graphene@xcite in laboratories has triggered great research interests in recent years . from the topological viewpoint , edge states can be induced in the system with different edge geometries@xcite ; in experiments , with the help of scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy , the presence of structure - dependent edge states of graphite can be observed@xcite .",
    "there are some papers@xcite showing the similarity between the graphene model and the @xmath0-wave superconductor@xcite with edges , where the existence of edge states depends on its edge shapes . for comparison , on a @xmath1 surface of a @xmath2 -wave superconductor ,",
    "the origin of the andreev bound states is the @xmath3 -phase shift due to the unconventional pairing symmetry , and graphene can be seem as an odd - parity superconductor@xcite , at the zigzag / bearded edges , different signs of pairing potential lead to a @xmath3-phase shift and zero - energy bound states , while at the armchair edge , it will not show the localized edge states .",
    "hence the study on the zero mode of the edge state will have the fundamental meaning that can supply some information about the phase structure .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the edge states of the semi - infinite armchair edged graphene ( aeg ) analytically with the help of transfer matrix method@xcite .",
    "there are many papers showing the edge states in graphene models in different ways , while most of them focus on the zero mode of the zigzag graphene nanoribbon .",
    "and here we pay our attention on the semi - infinite armchair edged graphene , and study the zero - energy and non - zero - energy edge states . according to the discussions of the properties of the transfer matrix , we show an analytically proof of the non - existence of the edge states in the semi - infinite aeg .",
    "we have to mention that we just consider about nearest - neighbor - interaction in our whole discussions .",

    "the recursions eq . ( [ eq:2 - 2 ] ) are reduced into two decoupled equations for sublattice @xmath8 and @xmath34 : @xmath35    above equations can be rewritten as follows transfer matrix equations : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 it is easy to get two eigenvalues of @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 . @xmath42 and two eigenvalues @xmath43 must be complex and @xmath44 .",
