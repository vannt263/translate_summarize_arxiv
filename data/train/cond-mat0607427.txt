    "the translationally invariant hubbard model has long been studied as a model of itinerant magnetism and ( mott ) insulating behavior .",
    "more recently , the possibility of unconventional ( @xmath0wave ) superconductivity and spontaneously occurring charge inhomogeneities ( stripes and checkerboards ) has been explored , especially in the context of high temperature superconductivity.@xcite including disorder in the hubbard hamiltonian , for example in the form of a distribution of bond or site energies , imposes charge inhomogeneity externally and allows for the exploration of a number of other interesting phenomena such as the formation of anderson insulating phases , possible transitions to metallic behavior driven by interactions@xcite , and the influence of disorder on magnetic correlations@xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting suggestion made recently @xcite concerns the possibility of mott insulating phases away from half - filling in a hubbard model corresponding to a binary alloy , that is , for which the probability distribution of site energies is bimodal , @xmath1 .",
    "the idea is that if @xmath2 is sufficiently large compared to the bandwidth @xmath3 , the non - interacting density of states will be split and an insulating gap will separate two density of states peaks of weight @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "when an on - site repulsion @xmath6 is turned on , these two peaks may in turn be hubbard split by @xmath6 .",
    "thus in the limit @xmath7 one can have mott insulating phases at incommensurate densities @xmath8 and @xmath9 which correspond to half - filling the two alloy subbands .",
    "a further interesting aspect of these mott insulators is that they likely occur in the absence of antiferromagnetic ordering and its associated symmetry breaking , a phenomenon which complicates the metal - insulator transition in the translationally invariant hubbard model at @xmath10 .",
    "possible experimental realizations of the binary alloy hubbard hamiltonian in two dimensions include co - fe monolayers@xcite .",
    "the nature of magnetism in such systems has been explored by first principles calculations @xcite .",
    "the previous studies of mott transitions off half - filling within tight binding models were with dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) . in this letter",
    "we will re - examine the physics of the binary alloy hubbard model using determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) simulations and exact diagonalization .",
    "while these methods are restricted to finite size lattices , they allow us to examine some of the aspects of the effects of randomness like anderson localization which are not accessible with dmft .",
    "the specific hamiltonian we study is : @xmath11 here @xmath12 are the usual fermion creation ( destruction ) operators for spin @xmath13 on site @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the number operator , and @xmath16 refers to near neighbor pairs on a two dimensional square lattice .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath6 are the electron hopping , chemical potential , and on - site interaction strength , respectively , and @xmath19 is a local site energy given by the bimodal distribution described previously .",
    "the bandwidth is @xmath20 when @xmath21 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we will first describe some of the details of our computational methodology .",
    "we then show results for the density as a function of chemical potential which illustrate the appearance of mott plateaus off half filling , and also demonstrate the consistency of dqmc and direct diagonalization .",
    "results for the participation ratio in the non - interacting limit suggest that the mott plateaus at @xmath8 and @xmath9 could in fact be rather different , a conclusion which we then confirm by calculating the temperature dependence of the conductivity . finally , we examine the critical hopping @xmath22 required to destroy the mott plateau .",
    "we conclude by constructing the corresponding phase diagram .",
    "we study the alloy hubbard hamiltonian with exact diagonalization and dqmc @xcite .",
    "the former approach is a standard application of the lanczos algorithm to determine exactly the ground state wave function .",
    "we use @xmath23 site lattices . in this case",
    "@xmath24 is sufficiently small that we can sum over all disorder realizations . in order to reduce finite size effects",
    ", we employ the boundary condition averaging method @xcite . in the noninteracting limit , averaging over different hopping phases at the boundary for a finite lattice reproduces the thermodynamic limit spectrum exactly . for @xmath6 nonzero , the finite size effects , while not eliminated , are dramatically reduced .",
    "specifically , we implement a 2x4 cluster with two boundary phases ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , one boundary phase for each of the two independent , orthogonal boundaries .",
    "an average over the phase space area encompassed by @xmath27 and @xmath28 was done by selecting 10 to 100 ( @xmath29 ) pairs .    in the dqmc approach ,",
    "the partition function @xmath30 is expressed as a path integral by discretizing the inverse temperature @xmath31 .",
    "the on - site interaction is then replaced by a sum over a discrete hubbard - stratonovich field @xcite .",
    "the resulting quadratic form in the fermion operators can be integrated out analytically , leaving an expression for @xmath30 in terms of a sum over all values of the hubbard - stratonovich field with a summand ( boltzmann weight ) which is the product of the determinants of two matrices ( one for spin up and one for spin down )",
    ". the sum is sampled stochastically using the metropolis algorithm .",
    "we present results for @xmath32 lattices .",
    "we average over @xmath33 realizations of the local site energies .",
    "equal time operators such as the density and energy are measured by accumulating appropriate elements , and products of elements , of the inverse of the matrix whose determinant gives the boltzmann weight .",
    "for the conductivity , @xmath34 , we employ an approximate procedure@xcite which allows @xmath34 to be computed from the wavevector @xmath35- and imaginary time @xmath36-dependent current - current correlation function @xmath37 without the necessity of performing an analytic continuation @xcite , @xmath38 here @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 the @xmath42-dependent current in the @xmath4-direction , is the fourier transform of , @xmath43 this approach has been extensively tested for the superconducting - insulator transition in the attractive hubbard model @xcite , as well as for metal - insulator transitions in the repulsive model @xcite .    in order to get further insight into the physics of anderson localization",
    ", we also diagonalize the noninteracting system on lattices as large as @xmath44 .",
    "we characterize the properties of the noninteracting eigenfunctions @xmath45 through the scaling of the participation ratio , @xmath46 for an eigenfunction perfectly localized at a site @xmath47 , @xmath48 we have , @xmath49 , while for a perfectly delocalized eigenfunction @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 . in general , @xmath52 is a measure of the extent of the eigenfunction , that is , the number of sites for which @xmath53 is non - negligible .",
    "we first demonstrate the existence of the mott and band insulating phases by looking at the density as a function of chemical potential . fig .  1 shows the case @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we see a mott insulating plateau extending from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , in which the total density is @xmath59 . at @xmath58 ,",
    "the lower alloy subband becomes doubly occupied and @xmath60 .",
    "a second plateau then reflects the ` band ' gap which must be surpassed to begin occupying the upper alloy subband , which is , like the lower subband , also hubbard split .    in fig .  1 ,",
    "the mott plateaus revealed in @xmath61 at @xmath59 and @xmath62 appear rather similar .",
    "we now argue that the nature of the states is , instead , quite different . for a square lattice in @xmath63",
    "the percolation threshold is @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we therefore might expect that the non - interacting states with site energy @xmath65 , out of which the @xmath8 plateau is built , are localized , since the constitute only a fraction @xmath66 of the sites in the lattice .",
    "meanwhile , the non - interacting states with site energy @xmath67 , out of which the @xmath9 plateau is built , are delocalized .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 where we show the participation ratio of the noninteracting system .",
    "states with energies corresponding to the upper alloy subband , which has a density exceeding the percolation threshold , extend over a macroscopic portion of the lattice .",
    "states in the lower alloy subband are localized .",
    "we now use the temperature dependence of the conductivity to argue that the distinction between the two mott insulating plateaus is preserved when the interaction @xmath6 is turned on .",
    "3 gives @xmath34 as a function of @xmath18 for three different temperatures @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the conductivity is zero in both the mott and band insulator phases . in the regions bracketing the upper alloy band",
    ", @xmath34 is relatively large , and increases as @xmath71 is lowered .",
    "that is , these regions are metallic . for densities bracketing the lower alloy subband",
    ", @xmath34 is a factor of four smaller , and increases much less noticeably as @xmath71 is lowered . because of the sign problem .",
    "we are not able to obtain data for lower @xmath71 .",
    "however , we believe that , as in the case of the hubbard model with random site or bond energies @xcite , the conductivity will turn over and decrease as @xmath71 is lowered further , reflecting the insulating character of the states .    0.2 in    we have presented dqmc results at @xmath54 , @xmath55 which correspond to on - site interaction and alloy site energy separation about twice and four times the bandwidth , respectively .",
    "the reason for these strong coupling values is that for larger @xmath17 it is not possible to reach low enough temperatures to see clear plateaus in the density versus chemical potential plots .",
    "however , we argued that diagonalization and dqmc gave consistent results ( see fig .  1 ) , and we will now use the former approach to generate the ground state phase diagram at weaker couplings . as before ,",
    "we average over different boundary condition phases to reduce finite size effects .",
    "4 shows the length of the three plateaus as the hopping @xmath17 is increased for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the two mott plateaus appear to vanish at roughly the same hopping strength , @xmath72 .",
    "the band insulator is less robust , and is destroyed when quantum fluctuations are only about half as strong .",
    "the reason is that when hopping off of one of the lower energy alloy sites for a mott insulator you have to pay a cost of @xmath55 .",
    "however , when you hop off of one of these sites for the band insulator you only have to pay the cost of @xmath73 .",
    "this greater ease of such charge fluctuations for the band insulator makes its destruction by increasing @xmath17 occur earlier .    similar data for other choices of @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath2 allow us to generate the ground state phase diagram . in fig .",
    "5 we show four possible phases for the region of which @xmath74 . as in fig .",
    "4 , large @xmath17 that correspond to small @xmath75 and @xmath76 will suppress the insulating plateaus which results in a metallic phase .",
    "taking the limiting case for small @xmath75 and large @xmath76,we find one band insulating plateau at @xmath77 .",
    "inversely , for small @xmath76 and large @xmath75 , we find two mott phases at @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "for large @xmath75 and @xmath76 , both band and mott insulator phases coexist .",
    "the case for @xmath78 will correspond to two band insulators at @xmath4 and @xmath79 and a mott insulator at half - filling for sufficiently large values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "in this paper we have presented dqmc and diagonalization results for the phase diagram of the hubbard model with binary alloy disorder . in agreement with previous treatments@xcite , we find mott insulating behavior away from half - filling when the separation of the two site energies exceeds @xmath6 .",
    "we extended the earlier results to characterize the nature of the compressible states above and below the mott insulating plateaus by showing that their conductivity markedly differs .",
    "together with the results for the participation ratio , our data suggest that for @xmath80 the lowest mott plateau separates two compressible anderson insulating regions , while the upper mott plateau separates two compressible metallic phases .",
    "our results have focused primarily on @xmath56 , but different behavior would emerge for other values of @xmath4@xcite .",
    "for example , choosing a value of @xmath81 would not only produce mott plateaus at @xmath82 and 1.70 , but also create a lower mott gap that are surrounded by metallic phases .",
    "consequently , the upper mott gap ( @xmath83 ) would be in between two anderson insulating states .",
    "a closer examination of magnetic correlations in this model is of interest , and will be the subject of future work . while we expect that disorder will suppress magnetism , as will the fact that the mott phases are away from commensurate fillings , it is also the case that disorder can increase the exchange constant @xmath84 and hence the nel temperature in certain circumstances @xcite . examining the real space magnetic correlations using dqmc would be a useful complement to previous dmft studies ."
