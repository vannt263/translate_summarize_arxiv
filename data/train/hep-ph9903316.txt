    "solving a theory for interacting fields is one of the major challenges in quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "it is in fact amazing to realize that , besides the coupling constant perturbation ( ccp ) , the analytical ( approximate ) solutions at our disposal are of a semi - classical nature .",
    "these are based on expansions in the number of colors @xmath1 , flavors @xmath2 , or simply charges @xmath3 , depending on the problem at hand .",
    "i will refer to these generically by the @xmath0-expansion .",
    "the symmetries are known to be preserved by these approaches since the dynamics , like in the case of the ccp , is sorted out according to an expansion in an arbitrary parameter .",
    "it is well known that the usual ccp is supported by a fock space made of an `` uncorrelated '' vacuum @xmath4 and excited states @xmath5 build by the action of creation operators of the quantized canonical fields .",
    "going to higer order in the loops one builds correlations perturbatively which leads to a gradual redefinition of the vaccum at each order .",
    "an interesting question to raise is : can one envisage a similar construction for the fock space in the case of a nonperturbative approach e.g. the semi - classical ones ? in the following",
    "i will explore such a possibility and show that the idea is fertile and can even help guessing a promising `` new '' nonperturbative approach .",
    "the latter , in contrast to the semi - classical one , is an approximate solution with a full quantum character .",
    "it transcends the @xmath0-expansion and contains the gaussian functional approach ( gfa ) .",
    "in fact , it was the need for such kind of solutions of qft which triggered the interest into the gfa .",
    "unfortunately , it was quickly realized that the latter , being order mixing , is not in general able to treat the symmetries correctly @xcite . here",
    "i would like to argue that the second nonperturbative symmetry conserving approximation , next to the @xmath0-expansion , needs in fact much more vaccum - correlations than what the gfa offers .",
    "we will see that these correlations are of a rpa - type , selected carefully by dynamically mapping the canonical fields into the currents with the corresponding quantum numbers .",
    "the idea of substituting the currents for the canonical fields is in fact not new .",
    "it was used in the late sixties by callan , dashen , sharp , sommerfield , and sugawara @xcite in an attempt to build a qft with currents as dynamical variables giving up the concept of describing the fields with canonical variables . in the following",
    ", i would like to draw a slightly different picture .",
    "although i will substitute for the asymptotic fields the corresponding currents , i will not renounce the use of the canonical fields as building blocks of qft . mapping these canonical fields into the currents will then help in gathering the dynamics which dress the asymptotic fields while preserving the symmetry . in section 3",
    ", we will see how this can be put to work in building a nonperturbative pion by mapping its canonical field into the axial current .",
    "however , i will first , in section 2 , revisit the semi - classical @xmath0-expansion approach using the very concept of dynamical mappings .",
    "+ as an example , consider the toy model of qft , the @xmath6-theory with a continuous @xmath7 symmetry . the lagrangian density with the appropriate scaling reads @xmath8    - \\frac{\\mu^2}{2 } \\left [ { \\vec{\\pi}}^2 + { \\sigma}^2 \\right ]   - \\frac{\\lambda}{4n}\\left [ { \\vec{\\pi}}^2 + { \\sigma}^2 \\right]^2     + \\sqrt{n}c { \\sigma}~ , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 stands for a @xmath10-components pion field and @xmath11 its chiral partner .",
    "first let us see how the concept of symmetry conserving dynamical mapping ( scdm ) can be used to retrieve the well known @xmath0-expansion .",
    "it is clear that , due to the bose statistics , the pion wave function induces direct and exchange contributions ( hartree and fock terms ) which are of two distinct orders in the @xmath0 counting .",
    "therefore to hinder any order mixing in the @xmath0-expansion one should , whatever the procedure used , only allow the hartree terms as leading contributions and relegate the fock terms to the sub - leading orders .",
    "this is , however , only possible if the pion wave - function is severely truncated , leading to a particle which does nt fully enjoy the quantum statistics or , in other words , to a hartree particle .",
    "sorting out the dynamics according to this scheme can be achieved by means of a pion - pair bosonization via the so - called holstein - primakoff mapping ( hpm ) .",
    "the latter appeared first in the early fourties @xcite as a realization of the @xmath12 algebra for quasi - spins .",
    "it was forgotten ever since and reappeared in the sixties in the nuclear many - body problem where it was used for bosonizing fermion - pairs ( see @xcite for a review ) . in the present case",
    "the hpm for pion - pairs reads ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 stand for the pion creation and annihilation operators , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are real boson operators obeying the heisenberg - weyl algebra .",
    "this mapping is made in such a way that the original algebra , obeyed by the pairs of operators at the l.h.s of eq.([eq2 ] ) , is also realized by the ansatz at the r.h.s .",
    "the square root is to be understood as a formal power series in the operators .",
    "thus the hamiltonian of the vector model derived from eq.([eq1 ] ) will naturally inherit a formal expansion of the form :   @xmath17 , where the superscripts indicate the powers of the operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 and also @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the sigma field . at this stage ,",
    "the content in @xmath10 of each order @xmath22 is not yet specified .",
    "also the formal expansion is in reality not unique since the operators are not in normal order .",
    "therefore a definition of a vacuum is mandatory if one wishes to make any use of the above expansion . by defining a vacuum for the @xmath18 and @xmath20 operators",
    "one makes the hpm dynamical . to meet the desired @xmath0-expansion approach",
    "this step is indeed decisive . in other words not",
    "any vacuum and thus not any fock space is able to support this approach .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the vacuum of the @xmath0-expansion is a coherent state @xmath23 |0>~,\\ ] ] which can accommodate condensates of the sigma field , denoted here by @xmath24 , as well as pairs of hartree pions , denoted by @xmath25 . assuming this , the hamiltonian displays then a parallel ( and unambiguous ) expansion in the powers of @xmath10 , such that @xmath26 here the terms @xmath27 have no content in @xmath10 . to gather the dynamics",
    ", one has to diagonalise @xmath28 .",
    "odd powers in @xmath29 are completely off - diagonal and therefore ought to disappear .",
    "the leading order dynamics is contained in the three lowest terms , thus we disregard here all higher terms . the term @xmath30 is washed out by performing a variational hartree - bogoliubov ( hb ) calculation , using @xmath24 and @xmath25 as variational parameters in minimizing the ground state energy .",
    "the bilinear @xmath31 is diagonalized by applying a canonical bogoliubov rotation @xcite which mixes the operators @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 such that : @xmath32 .",
    "\\label{eq328}\\ ] ] this is nothing but a @xmath33 rpa - scattering equation coupled to a dyson equation for the sigma mode . the vacuum of the theory is accordingly modified .",
    "the latter , denoted by @xmath34 , is implicitly defined by @xmath35 and explicitly obtained via a unitary transformation - sector , the second is a similar one in the @xmath36-sector and the third is a unitary transformation which mixes both sectors @xcite .",
    "] of the coherent state :   @xmath37 .",
    "+ this exhausts the leading order dynamics . in a cutoff theory , the @xmath34-vacuum ,",
    "obtained so far , possesses a broken phase with a finite sigma - condensate @xmath38 and two curvatures ; one is the goldstone boson mass , obtained in the hb mean - field , and the second is the sigma mass , obtained in the rpa .",
    "these are given by @xmath39~ ,   \\quad\\quad\\quad    \\frac{c}{{\\langle { \\sigma } \\rangle } } = \\mu^{2 } + \\lambda \\left [ i_{\\pi } +     { \\langle { \\sigma } \\rangle}^2 \\right]~ , \\\\ m_{\\sigma}^2 \\,&=&\\ , \\mu^2 + \\lambda \\left [ i_{\\pi } + 3 { \\langle { \\sigma } \\rangle}^2\\right ] \\,+\\ , \\frac{2 \\lambda^4 { \\langle { \\sigma } \\rangle}^2\\,{\\sigma}_{\\pi\\pi}(m_{\\sigma}^2 ) } { 1\\,-\\ ,   \\lambda^2 { \\sigma}_{\\pi\\pi}(m_{\\sigma}^2)}~.   \\label{eq513}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath40 is the tadpole of the hb - pion and @xmath41 stands for the convoluted two hb - pion propagator ( rpa bubble of hb - pions ) .",
    "naturally , this approach preserves the whole hierarchy of ward identities .",
    "in particular , the lowest one which expresses the current conservation ( in pcac sense ) , @xmath42 , holds .",
    "figures 1.a and 1.b show the summed class of diagrams .    *",
    "*   dyson equation for the @xmath43 mode coupled to a rpa equation for @xmath33-scattering . according to this scheme ,",
    "the sigma mass is build perturbatively ( in contrast to the self - consistent building of the pion and the condensate in figure 1.a . )",
    "the approach presented in the previous section is very appealing from many aspects and particularly from its symmetry conserving character .",
    "however , it has a serious drawback .",
    "the pion , constructed so far , is a hartree particle thus a semi - quantum ( semi - classical ) `` object '' .",
    "it is also the building block for all higher n - point functions , as suggested by the whole hierarchy of ward identities .",
    "attempts made with the gfa failed so far to correct for this @xcite . indeed , assuming the full wave function of the pion ( instead of truncating it )",
    "induces an uncontrollable order mixing which inevitably `` destroys the symmetry '' . as stated in the introduction , one way out is to map the canonical pion field into the axial current .",
    "this idea is supported by the exact ( goldstone ) statement :  @xmath44  , which allows to build a pion state by acting with the symmetry generator on the full correlated vacuum of the theory . in an effective model , the generator @xmath45 is simply given by noether s theorem .",
    "therefore one can use the field structure of @xmath45 to model an excitation operator for the asymptotic pion field . in the present case",
    ", the creation operator of the iso - vector pion takes the form @xmath46.~~",
    "\\label{eq210}\\ ] ] here the operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 represent the canonical pion- and sigma- fields . the @xmath49 and @xmath50 amplitudes are fixed dynamically . using these as variational variables to minimize the the pion - state energy @xmath51 leads to the so - called rowe equation of motion @xmath52\\right]{| { rpa } \\rangle}= m_{\\pi}{\\langle   { rpa } |}\\left [ \\delta { \\vec q}_{\\pi }   , { \\vec q}_{\\pi}^+\\right]{| { rpa } \\rangle}~ , \\label{eq329}\\ ] ] where h is the hamiltonian of the model , @xmath53 is the pion mass ( excitation energy to create a pion at rest ) and @xmath34 is an approximate ansatz to the full correlated vacuum @xmath54 , defined implicitly by :   @xmath55 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem in eq.([eq329 ] ) , in its present variational form , is known as the self - consistent rpa which can not be solved in practice .",
    "therefore one uses in general the quasi - boson assumption which approximates the bilinear @xmath56 by a boson . thus eq.([eq329 ] ) is linearized . in the exact chiral limit @xmath57 ,",
    "one of its solutions , if successfully normalized , has zero energy @xmath58 .",
    "the normalization of this goldstone solution can in fact be achieved by optimizing the rpa basis .",
    "this is done by dynamically mapping the original canonical pion @xmath59 and sigma @xmath60 fields into hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) fields @xmath61 here @xmath62 are variational functions chosen to minimize the energy of the vacuum of the theory .",
    "the latter is given , up to an unimportant factor , by the squeezed state @xmath63 { | { 0 } \\rangle}~.   \\label{eq335}\\ ] ] the dynamics gathered at this hfb mean - field appear in the following set of equations : @xmath64~ ,   \\quad\\quad   { \\cal e}_{\\sigma}^2= \\mu^2 + \\lambda \\left [ i_{\\pi } +     \\frac{3}{n } i_{\\sigma } + 3   { \\langle { \\sigma } \\rangle}^2\\right]~ , \\nonumber\\\\    \\frac{c}{{\\langle { \\sigma } \\rangle } } & = & \\mu^{2 } +     \\lambda \\left [    i_{\\pi } + \\frac{3}{n } i_{\\sigma } +   { \\langle { \\sigma } \\rangle}^2 \\right]~.    \\label{eq16 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which consist of three coupled self - consistent bcs gap equations that give the condensate @xmath65 and the two curvatures @xmath66 of the squeezed vacuum @xmath67 . + here",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath68 are , respectively , the tadpoles for the pion and sigma quasi - particles ( with the hartree and fock terms considered together ) .",
    "this is precisely the dynamics generated by the gfa where @xmath69 stands for the asymptotic pion mass .",
    "this is , however , clearly wrong .",
    "indeed , in the exact chiral limit ( @xmath70 ) and for a finite condensate , the curvature @xmath69 does not vanish ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the squeezed state and equally the gaussian functional can not be regarded as a viable vacuum for the theory since the goldstone theorem is violated .",
    "however , the rpa ground state , as implicitly defined by @xmath55 , is a good candidate for a vacuum with broken symmetry . the latter , in the case of the quasi - boson assumption ( used here ) ,",
    "is explicitly obtained by an unitary transformation of the squeezed state : @xmath71 .",
    "the curvature along the valley of this ground - state is given by the rpa eigenvalue @xmath53 and reads : @xmath72 \\left[\\sigma_{\\pi\\sigma}(0 )   \\,-\\ , \\sigma_{\\pi\\sigma}(m_{\\pi}^2)\\right ] } { 1\\quad-\\quad \\frac{2 \\lambda^2}{n } \\sigma_{\\pi\\sigma}(m_{\\pi}^2 ) } \\label{eq212}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the convoluted quasi - pion and quasi - sigma propagators ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "it is clear , from eq.([eq212 ] ) , that the asymptotic pion is not only highly nonperturbative in the coupling @xmath74 but also has a non - trivial content in @xmath10 , in contrast to the hb - pion of section 2 .",
    "it is , however , still a goldstone mode , since for @xmath70 and @xmath75 a zero pion mass exists .",
    "furthermore it is easily verified that the ward identity , @xmath76 , holds here too .",
    "there is obviously an urgent need for developing symmetry conserving nonperturbative approaches with tractable analytical solutions to qft .",
    "i exposed here the concept of scdm which is a promising tool that gives a helpful insight on the structure of the fock space .",
    "besides the hpm which leads to the @xmath0-expansion , i presented a second scdm that relies on a systematic scheme which consists of mapping the canonical fields into the corresponding currents .",
    "the latter mapping was made dynamical in the quasi - particle rpa .",
    "the vacuum of the theory was then found to have more correlations than the vacuums of the @xmath0-expansion and the gfa alike .",
    "extensions to higher rpa , finite temperature and baryon density as well as to richer dynamics are possible @xcite",
