    "the two - body scattering length in a dilute gas of alkali atoms can be varied by changing the external magnetic field close to a feshbach resonance @xcite . in this way",
    "one may force the two - body s - wave scattering length to go from positive to negative values through infinity .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field should be an appropriate tool in modeling the efimov effect .",
    "we recall that this effect occurs in case of infinite two - body scattering lengths , manifesting itself in an infinite number of three - body bound states .",
    "this role of the magnetic field combined with a feshbach resonance may be mimicked by varying the coupling constant of the two - body interaction within a three - body system that is not necessarily subject to a magnetic field @xcite . in this context",
    "the system of three @xmath0he atoms appears to be the best candidate .",
    "actually , it has been shown that the excited state of the @xmath0he trimer is already of efimov nature . to get the complete efimov effect it suffices to weaken the he  he interatomic potential only by about 3% .",
    "in the present work we extend the investigation of the three - atomic helium systems undertaken in @xcite , which was based on a mathematically rigorous hard - core version of the faddeev differential equations .",
    "we calculate the scattering lengths for @xmath3he atoms - @xmath0he dimer collisions . under the assumption that weakening the potential mimics the behaviour of the scattering length in a magnetic field",
    ", we show the dependence of low - energy three - body scattering properties on the two - body scattering length .",
    "some of the results presented in this paper were reported already in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "in our calculations we employed the hard - core version of the faddeev differential equations developed in @xcite . as he - he interaction we used the semi - empirical hfd - b @xcite and lm2m2 @xcite potentials by aziz and co - workers , and the more recent , purely theoretically derived tty @xcite potential by tang , toennies and yiu . for the explicit form of these polarization potentials we refer to the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite . as in our previous calculations",
    "we choose @xmath4k@xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for the masses of the @xmath2he and @xmath0he atoms , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0he dimer binding energies and @xmath0he@xmath0he scattering lengths obtained with the hfd - b , lm2m2 , and tty potentials are shown in table [ tabledimerlen ] .",
    "note that the inverse of the wave number @xmath9 lies rather close to the corresponding scattering length .",
    ".dimer energy @xmath10 , wave length @xmath11 , and @xmath0he@xmath12@xmath0he scattering length @xmath13 for the potentials used , as compared to the experimental values of ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     due to the smaller mass of the @xmath2he atom , the @xmath2he ",
    "@xmath0he system is unbound . nevertheless , the @xmath2he@xmath0he@xmath1 trimer exists , though with a binding energy of about 14 mk ( see @xcite and references therein ) . and , in contrast to the symmetric case , there is no excited ( efimov - type ) state in the asymmetric @xmath2he@xmath0he@xmath1 system .",
    "table  [ tsclength3 ] contains our results for the @xmath2he@xmath0he@xmath1 scattering length .",
    "following the idea that weakening the potential could imitate the action of a magnetic field on the scattering length , we multiply the original potential @xmath14 by a factor @xmath15 . decreasing this coupling constant , there emerges a virtual state of energy @xmath16 on the second energy sheet .",
    "this energy , relative to the two - body binding energy @xmath10 , is given in column 4 of table [ tablesclength1 ] .",
    "when decreasing @xmath15 further , this state turns into the second excited state .",
    "its energy @xmath17 relative to @xmath10 is shown in the next column .",
    "these energy results are in a good agreement with the literature @xcite .",
    "when the second excited state emerges , the @xmath18he@xmath0he@xmath1 scattering length @xmath19 changes its sign going through a pole , while the two - body scattering length @xmath20 increases monotonically .",
