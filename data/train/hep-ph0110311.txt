    "<S> for @xmath77 , the nlo - qcd fit lies below the lo analysis and , consequently , it lies somewhat below our results in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the essential differences between the gvd / cdp presented here and related approaches @xcite were briefly touched in @xcite . as additional distinctive feature </S>",

    "<S> , it is clear that scaling in @xmath78 , assuming @xmath79 for simplicity , is intimately connected with the color - dipole approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is a consequence of the @xmath80 dependence of the color - dipole cross section in ( [ ( 9 ) ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a different ansatz for the color - dipole cross section , such as the one in ref.@xcite that contains an @xmath81 dependence , accordingly , is bound to also imply a scaling behavior for @xmath82 , which is expected to be based on a different scaling variable . in @xcite </S>",

    "<S> the variable @xmath83 , however , does not allow one to consistently include @xmath85 photoproduction .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the hera data on dis in the low-@xmath71 diffraction region , including @xmath85 photoproduction , find a natural interpretation in the gvd / cdp that rests on the generic structure of two - gluon exchange from qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon density that in the appropriate limit corresponds to the color - dipole cross section is consistent with the results from qcd fits . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections for real and virtual photons on protons become identical in the limit of infinite energy . </S>"
