    "the paper presents materials illustrating the use and extensions of the concepts of functional self - similarity and the bogoliubov renormalization group in boundary value problems of mathematical physics .",
    "the ( lie transformation ) group structure discovered by stueckelberg and petermann in the early 1950s in calculation results in renormalized quantum field theory and the exact symmetry of solutions related to this structure were used in 1955 by bogoliubov and one of the present authors to develop a regular method for improving approximate solutions of quantum field problems , the renormalization group ( rg ) method .",
    "this method is based on the use of the infinitesimal form of the exact group property of a solution to improve a perturbative ( that is , obtained by means of the perturbation theory ) representation of this solution .",
    "the improvement of the approximation properties of a solution turns out to be most efficient in the presence of a singularity , because the correct structure of the singularity is then recovered .",
    "the most spectacular results obtained by the renormalization - group method in quantum field theory were the discovery of the asymptotic freedom of non - abelian gauge theories ( nobel prize in 2004 ) , which led to the creation of quantum chromodynamics , and sketching the picture of the joint evolution in energy of the three effective interaction functions ( electromagnetic , weak , and strong ) in the standard model , which led to the speculative conjecture of a grand unification of interactions and the possible instability of the proton .",
    "apart from this , the quantum field renormalization group provided a foundation ( see k.g .",
    "wilson s nobel lecture , 1982 ) for the construction of an approximate semigroup in the investigation of phase transitions in large spin lattices , the so - called wilson renormalization group , which is widely used in the analysis of critical phenomena .    in the present paper",
    ", we discuss the most interesting results obtained by the authors by extending the rg concepts in quantum field theory to boundary value problems of classical mathematical physics . the main achievement here was the development of a regular algorithm for finding symmetries of the rg type by means of the modern theory of transformation groups .",
    "the existence of such an algorithm eliminates the usual deficiency of the rg approach beyond the scope of quantum field theory problems : finding the group property of solutions requires using special - purpose methods of analysis , usually nonstandard , in each particular case .",
    "it is notable that the algorithm of the construction of renormalization - group symmetries proposed here can be applied to problems involving differential and integral equations , as well as linear functional of the solutions .",
    "we illustrate applications of the algorithm by examples from nonlinear optics , kinetic theory , and plasma dynamics , including the problem of propagation and self - focusing of a wave beam in a nonlinear medium ( sections [ rg - kcs ] and [ rg - apr - ngo ] ) , problems of the dynamics of a plasma bunch and ion acceleration ( section [ plasma - dyn ] ) , and the generation of harmonics in laser plasma ( section [ plasma_harmonics ] ) . there",
    ", the use of renormalization - group symmetries brought about new exact and approximate analytic solutions of nonlinear physics problems , which allowed describing the space structure of a self - focusing beam in a nonlinear medium in a realistic setting , making significant progress in establishing relations between the intensity of the harmonics generated by weakly inhomogeneous laser plasma in a strongly nonlinear regime and the parameters of the radiation and the plasma , and finding , for the first time , the energy spectrums of accelerated ions in the kinematic description of an adiabatic expansion of plasma bunches consisting of several kinds of ions .",
    "this paper is motivated by our desire to draw theorists attention to a new and fairly general algorithm based on applying the symmetry to an approximate solution for enhancing its approximation power .",
    "the use of the group property ( the symmetry ) of a solution underlies both the renormalization group method in quantum field theory and its analogue , the new renormalization group symmetry algorithm in mathematical physics .",
    "the universality of the renormalization - group ideas allows a unified approach to the analysis of properties of solutions of various nonlinear problems and gives grounds for hopes that this method can be efficiently used in other areas of contemporary physics .    as is known , this universality is a characteristic feature of another general method that represents a solution as a path integral ( functional integral ) and is widely used in quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , the theory of large statistical systems , and turbulence theory .",
    "classical mathematical physics deals with physical objects described by ( ordinary or partial ) differential equations , which are nonlinear , or integrodifferential in most practically interesting cases . finding analytic solutions of such equations for arbitrary initial and/or boundary conditions",
    "is impossible : normally , exact analytic solutions can only be found for initial and boundary data of a special form ; in other cases , we must content ourselves with approximate solutions .",
    "the method of constructing a solution of a specific boundary value problem ( bvp ) is usually peculiar to the equations of the particular problem under consideration .    in this paper , we present a method of investigation of analytic solutions based on the construction and use of symmetries of a special form of bvp solutions , which we call symmetries of the renormalization group kind or _",
    "renormalization group _ ( rg ) symmetries .",
    "we treat the notion of symmetry in the standard sense of continuous transformation groups : this means that a solution of the bvp is transformed into another solution of the same bvp by a continuous transformation group acting in the space of all the variables determining the solution .",
    "the attribute renormalization group points to similarities existing between these symmetries and the symmetries in quantum field theory related to the operation of renormalization of masses and charges ( coupling constants ) .",
    "we note that a connection between symmetries and the problem of finding solutions of differential equations was first established @xcite by a norwegian mathematician , sophus lie ( 1842 - 1899 ) , who showed that most results on the integration of ordinary differential equations of various kinds can be obtained by a general method , subsequently called the group analysis of differential equations .",
    "as one of the main ingredients of the theory of continuous groups , the group analysis of differential equations allows classifying differential equations using the language of symmetry groups , i.e. , it produces a complete list of equations that can be integrated ( or such that their order can be reduced ) by the group method and also suggests a _",
    "regular _ procedure for finding these symmetries .",
    "considerable progress in this area since the early 1950s has led to new concepts and algorithms , and has also extended the range of possible applications of the group analysis ( see , e.g. , monographs @xcite and handbook @xcite ) , but it has not changed the general aims of the modern group analysis to develop _ regular _ methods of constructing and classifying solutions of nonlinear differential equations on the basis of the symmetries of these equations .    in problems described by ordinary differential equations , the use of a symmetry group yields general and particular solutions . in problems involving partial differential equations , which are typical in mathematical physics , knowing a symmetry allows constructing particular solutions of a bvp ( invariant solutions , which are mapped into themselves by the group transformations , and partially invariant solutions ) , with boundary data not known a priori and determined in the construction of a specific solution .",
    "because arbitrary boundary data are not normally invariant under group transformations , the use of invariant solutions is generally considered inefficient for the solution of bvps .",
    "arguments underlying the renormalization group method in quantum field theory lead to a different conclusion @xcite .",
    "this method uses the group property of a solution ( expressed in quantum field theory as a functional equation ) for the enhancement of its approximation power .",
    "although the renormalization group method was originally formulated for quantum field problems , we can explain its core idea by an example of a planar problem of radiation transfer @xcite .",
    "we assume that the half - space @xmath0 is filled with homogeneous matter and a stationary stream of particles , characterized by a number @xmath1 , is falling on the boundary @xmath2 of this medium .",
    "we consider the evolution of the number of particles in the stream as it moves deeper into the medium .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number of particles in the stream at a distance @xmath4 from the vacuum - matter interface and @xmath5 the number of particles at the distance @xmath6 from the interface .",
    "because the medium is homogeneous , the number of particles moving inside at a distance @xmath7 from the interface is uniquely determined by some function @xmath8 of the value of @xmath1 at the interface and the distance @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . but the value @xmath5 can also be expressed as @xmath11 in terms of the same function @xmath12 of two variables , the distance @xmath13 from the imaginary interface @xmath4 and the number of particles @xmath3 at this interface . combining the two different definitions of @xmath5",
    ", we obtain the functional equation @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the nature of the particles and the properties of the medium are irrelevant for this consideration . of course",
    ", solving the transport problem ( i.e. , an integrodifferential kinetic equation ) , one can find the explicit ( exact or approximate ) form of the function @xmath15 in each particular case , but the exact solution of the problem necessarily satisfies eqn ( [ funceq ] ) .    a functional equation of form ( [ funceq ] ) occurs naturally in considering a one - parameter group @xmath16 of point transformations @xmath17 in the plane @xmath18 mapping a point @xmath19 into another point @xmath20 .",
    "we recall that a set @xmath16 of invertible transformations @xmath17 forms a group if these transformations satisfy several conditions : a ) the set @xmath16 contains the identity transformation @xmath21 ; b ) each @xmath17 has an inverse transformation @xmath22 ; c ) the composition @xmath23 of two transformations is also an element of @xmath16 : @xmath24 the last condition in ( [ defgroup ] ) can be expressed in terms of the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 in ( [ ta ] ) as two functional equations : @xmath27 it is known from the lie theory that each continuous one - parameter group is fully determined by the infinitesimal transformation @xmath28 which is customarily expressed using the _ infinitesimal operator _ ( or generator ) @xmath29 of the group .",
    "finite transformations of a continuous group are uniquely determined by the infinitesimal generator by means of the lie equations , which are the characteristic equations for the first - order partial differential equation associated with ( [ oper - def ] ) , @xmath30 for the radiation transfer problem under consideration , we have @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , and functional equation ( [ funceq ] ) coincides with the second equation in ( [ funceq12 ] ) ( the first equation there is an expression of the obvious additive law of the transformation of the coordinate @xmath35 ) , and the group generator is given by @xmath36 in accordance with ( [ lieeq - pt ] ) , to find @xmath37 at a large distance from the boundary , i.e. , for large values of the parameter @xmath13 , we must know the behavior of @xmath38 in a thin boundary layer , as @xmath39 , i.e. , we must in fact know the derivative of this function at the boundary .",
    "this information can usually be extracted from an approximate solution provided by the perturbation theory .",
    "next , integration of the lie equations yields formulas for finite transformations : @xmath40 assuming that @xmath41 has the inverse function @xmath42 , we find solutions of functional equation ( [ funceq ] ) in the general form : @xmath43 these constructions are the essence of the renormalization group method .",
    "we now present two examples of implementing this method .",
    "we consider a medium absorbing particles in proportion to their number ; from the perturbation theory , we know the approximate solution @xmath44 calculating the coordinate @xmath45 of group generator ( [ oper - trans ] ) with the help of ( [ transf - pert1 ] ) and using it in relations ( [ solution - lieeq ] ) , we obtain solution ( [ solution - funceq ] ) , @xmath46 which is valid in the entire space filled with matter , up to @xmath47 .",
    "we now assume that the absorption has a nonlinear mechanism , with the absorption coefficient proportional to the stream of particles , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 const . in a thin boundary layer",
    ", we then have @xmath50 and the use of ( [ transf - pert2 ] ) in ( [ solution - lieeq ] ) yields a solution of ( [ solution - funceq ] ) in the form of the sum of a geometric progression : @xmath51 this result , similarly to the previous one , holds in the entire subspace @xmath52 and , in particular , describes the asymptotic behavior of the permeating stream as @xmath47 .",
    "the efficiency of the ( renormalization ) group approach in the above examples shows itself in the following fact : using information about the behavior of a solution in a neighborhood of the vacuum - medium interface , we obtain explicit expressions for the solution over the entire interval @xmath53 .",
    "we note that if we expand expression ( [ transf - rg2 ] ) in a power series in the particle number density , i.e. , return to the perturbation theory , then in each order in @xmath54 , we obtain expressions increasing in proportion to @xmath55 , which is a distorted representation for the asymptotic form of the solution .",
    "the advantage of the renormalization group method is the recovery of the actual structure of the solution , consistent with functional equation ( [ funceq ] ) , which is distorted by perturbation theory approximations . ) and ( [ transf - rg2 ] ) can also be obtained in transfer theory by other methods , for instance , by solving the kinetic equation ; however , the method described here , based on the use of group differential equations , is the simplest .",
    "moreover , in several important cases , this is the only possible method : results obtained with this method are unattainable in other ways . ]    in the case of the planar problem of radiation transfer , the transparency of the renormalization group method is a consequence of taking account of the symmetry properties of solutions ( i.e. , of the functional equation for them ) in the actual configuration space .",
    "the rg transformation of the particle number density in moving deeper into the medium is related to a shift in the spatial coordinate .",
    "returning to the renormalization group method in its original ( quantum field ) formulation @xcite , which is also called the bogoliubov renormalization group , we note that it is based on a functional equation that in the simplest case has the same form as ( [ funceq ] ) after the substitution @xmath56 , such that the rg shift transformation of a spatial variable in transfer theory corresponds to the transferred momenta rescaling in quantum field theory ; the quantity @xmath57 is called the invariant ( effective ) coupling function in this theory . in particular , a solution of form ( [ transf - rg2 ] ) with @xmath58 occurs in quantum field calculations in the one - loop approximation .",
    "if a more advanced perturbation - theory approximation is used , which differs from ( [ transf - pert2 ] ) by the presence of terms cubic in @xmath1 , which corresponds to the two - loop approximation in quantum field theory , then the rg - improved solution can be found from an equation similar to ( [ solution - funceq ] ) that is unsolvable in elementary functions @xcite .",
    "it is usually solved iteratively , using the one - loop approximation of the rg expression .",
    "the comparison of the rg - improved solution found in the two - loop approximation with the result obtained in the one - loop approximation reveals a characteristic feature of the renormalization group method : we can progressively improve the accuracy , which is an indication of the stability of the asymptotic behavior of the solution .",
    "similarly , in the perturbation theory , we can also take higher - order corrections into account , which successively improves the corresponding rg solutions .",
    "thus , the procedure for the systematic ( successive ) improvement of the system of approximate solutions found in quantum field theory in the perturbation theory with respect to a known small parameter is quite similar to the above .",
    "this improvement of the approximation properties is most significant in the neighborhood of a singularity of the solution . in the quantum field context , these are singularities in the infrared ( see @xcite ) and ultraviolet domains .",
    "the latter include the most spectacular result obtained with the help of the rg method , the discovery of the asymptotic freedom of non - abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the above examples of the use of the renormalization group method for improving and refining the approximation properties of perturbative solutions are based on a functional equation of the simplest form , with one or two independent and one dependent variable .",
    "but the number of independent and dependent variables in the problem is often larger than this minimal set .",
    "for example , a version of functional equation ( [ funceq ] ) with @xmath59 corresponds to a massless model with one coupling constant in quantum field theory .",
    "we can make this model more involved in two ways .",
    "first , the number of arguments defining the effective coupling @xmath60 can be increased .",
    "for instance , the field model under consideration can contain one or several masses ( e.g. , as in quantum chromodynamics ) ; in that case , the effective coupling acquires a dependence on several mass variables with the corresponding transformation laws , with the result that the group transformations and the functional equation change their form .",
    "second , the number of functional equations can be larger , which corresponds to a quantum field model with several coupling constants .",
    "this means that we now consider a group of continuous transformations of independent variables @xmath61 and dependent variables @xmath62 with infinitesimal operator ( [ oper - def ] ) in the space @xmath63 , and the coordinates of generator ( [ oper - def ] ) are vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; the corresponding contributions to the infinitesimal operator must be understood as the result of the contributions of the individual variables . with an increase in the number of arguments of the function to be governed by the functional equation and an increase in the number of the equations themselves , finding the group property of the solution that can be expressed by a functional equation ( if we use the original formulation of the renormalization - group method  @xcite ) requires a special and often nontrivial analysis in each particular case ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) ; from the algorithmic standpoint , this is a deficiency of the rg techniques outside the quantum field theory .    to overcome this deficiency in extending the rg concepts to problems of mathematical physics ,",
    "another special rg algorithm was developed ( see @xcite and also reviews @xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "it has the same aim of finding an improved solution ( in comparison with the initial approximate solution ) as the algorithm of bogoliubov s rg method , but in finding symmetries of a solution of a bvp it uses a scheme of calculations similar to that of the modern group analysis .",
    "this feature explains the term rg",
    "symmetry @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the rg algorithm in mathematical physics and illustrate its capabilities by various examples of bvps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ illustration ] , we explain the core ideas of the rg algorithm using the example of the construction of an rg symmetry for a solution of a bvp for the hopf equation",
    ". sections  [ rgs - loc ] and [ rgs - nlc ] illustrate different approaches to the construction of rg symmetries ; furthermore , in section  [ rgs - loc ] , we consider several progressively more complicated problems obtained by modifying and supplementing the hopf equations in section  [ illustration ] .",
    "section  [ rgs - nlc ] follows the same logic , but we supplement the presentation there with a discussion of nonlocal problems , which are not necessarily connected with the ones in section  [ rgs - loc ] .",
    "the scope for possible applications of the rg algorithm and a brief list of results obtained with its use are presented in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we preface the description of the rg algorithm with the following simple argument .",
    "it is known that if we treat all the variables ( independent or dependent in the standard sense ) involved in a differential equation and their derivatives ( called differential variables in group analysis ) as independent , then the differential equation can be regarded as an algebraic relation for these variables . in the case of one equation , this relation describes a surface in the extended space of all the variables involved in the equation ( if there are several equations , then we speak of a manifold ) , and each solution of the equation defines a line on this surface .",
    "the projection onto the @xmath66 plane defines a family of curves , one of which passes through the point @xmath67 corresponding to the boundary condition of the bvp in question .",
    "transformations of the group @xmath16 move points on the surface ( the manifold ) along this surface , and therefore the equation preserves its form in the transformed variables and each solution of the equation is taken into another solution .",
    "a transformation @xmath17 from the group @xmath16 maps a point on the plane @xmath68 into a point @xmath69 , and the geometrical locus of these points is a continuous curve ( a trajectory of the group @xmath16 ) passing through @xmath66 . the locus of images @xmath70 is also called the @xmath16-orbit of the point @xmath66 . in the general case",
    ", the motion along a group trajectory corresponds to the transition from one curve in the family to another , that is , to a multiplication of solutions .",
    "returning to the renormalization - group point of view , we consider only the group transformations under which points on the curve passing through @xmath67 are moved along this curve .",
    "this means that the solution of the bvp is the rg orbit of the point @xmath67 ( of the boundary manifold in the general case ) and is an invariant rg manifold ( similarly to the invariant charge in quantum field theory @xcite ) .",
    "we use the infinitesimal version of this property in our construction of the rg symmetry .",
    "the group property of a solution of a bvp manifests itself as follows : instead of the boundary point @xmath67 parameterizing the solution , we can take another point in this curve related to it by an rg transformation .",
    "this universality of the solution of a bvp under a change of the way of parameterization is called functional self - similarity @xcite . to find rg transformations that map a solution of a bvp into a solution of the same bvp , we use the fact that a physical problem is formulated in terms of differential ( integrodifferential ) equations whose symmetries can be found by the techniques of group analysis .",
    "we now illustrate the characteristic features of the algorithm for constructing an rg symmetry by an example of a bvp for the hopf equation @xcite , which is widely used in physics for the description of the initial perturbations at the nonlinear stage of their evolution : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an invertible function of @xmath73 and the parameter @xmath74 defines the amplitude of the initial perturbation at the boundary @xmath75 . for a very small distance @xmath76 from the boundary ,",
    "the solution of problem ( [ hopf ] ) given by the perturbation theory is a segment of a power series , @xmath77 but this form becomes inapplicable for large @xmath78 .",
    "the rg symmetry allows improving the perturbative result and recovering the correct behavior of the solution in a neighborhood of a singularity ( when such a singularity occurs for some values of @xmath78 ) .",
    "in constructing an rg symmetry , the algorithm uses the symmetry group of the bvp equations .",
    "the boundary data defining a particular solution are involved in rg transformations by extending the space of the variables on which the group acts . in the case of bvp ( [ hopf ] ) , this space involves three independent variables , @xmath79 .",
    "it is convenient to write differential equation ( [ hopf ] ) for the function @xmath80 introduced such that the amplitude @xmath74 is carried over from the boundary condition to the differential equation : @xmath81 the general element of the transformation group @xmath16 for eqn ( [ hopf - eq ] ) ( for the basic manifold in the general case ) can be found by means of the standard lie techniques ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; it is given by a combination of four infinitesimal operators , @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are arbitrary functions of @xmath74 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 and @xmath87 is an arbitrary function of all the group variables @xmath88 .",
    "we now use the rg invariance condition for a particular solution of bvp ( [ hopf - eq ] ) defined by the relation @xmath89 with the function @xmath90 that is unknown at this point ; in other words , we check that the rg transformation maps the solution of the bvp into the same solution . in the infinitesimal form",

    "the above example of the construction of rg symmetries illustrates the general algorithm , whose detailed description in relation to bvps for differential equations can be found , e.g. , in reviews @xcite , and whose generalization to nonlocal problems is presented in @xcite .",

    "@xmath16 on a particular solution of the bvp and finding the rg symmetry ( rgs ) ; * finding an _ analytic solution _ corresponding to the rg symmetry .",
    "+    a characteristic feature of the procedure of constructing the rg symmetry is the multivariance of step * ( i ) * , whose aim is to have the parameters participating in the equations and the boundary conditions of the problem and determining the solution somehow involved in transformations .",
    "the choice of a concrete realization of the first step is most usually governed by the form of the basic equations and the corresponding boundary conditions on the one hand and by the form of the approximate pt solution on the other .",
    "this multivariance , which is a feature of step * ( i ) * alone , is aimed at covering a possibly broader spectrum of problems to be investigated by the method .",
    "the subsequent steps are carried out in the framework of well - developed group methods .",
    "this multivariance is also seen in the above simple example of a bvp for the hopf equation .",
    "underlying our construction of the rg symmetry for bvp ( [ hopf - eq ] ) was the most obvious option : constructing the rg symmetry from the point symmetry group of the hopf equation in the space extended by incorporating the parameter @xmath74 into the set of independent variables .",
    "this way of constructing the basic manifold @xmath122 is not the only possible one .",
    "we could also construct the rg symmetry for bvp ( [ hopf - eq ] ) using an additional differential constraint compatible with the boundary conditions and the basic equations .",
    "for instance , if the initial conditions in ( [ hopf - eq ] ) are given by the linear function @xmath117 , then we can take the differential constraint @xmath123 .",
    "next , we calculate the rg symmetry of bvp ( [ hopf - eq ] ) taking the basic manifold @xmath122 to be the system obtained by combining this constraint and the hopf equation .",
    "the admissible group @xmath16 for the manifold @xmath122 in so doing is different from ( [ gen - hopf ] ) , but the form of solution ( [ solution - hopf ] ) is the same .",
    "other examples of the implementation of step * ( i ) * of the algorithm can be found in @xcite .",
    "the example of the construction of the rg symmetry for hopf equation ( [ hopf - eq ] ) demonstrates that a particular form of the realization of the general scheme of the rg algorithm depends on the form of the equations in the bvp , as well as on the way the boundary data are specified .",
    "since the construction of the rg symmetry proceeds by restricting the symmetry group @xmath16 of the basic manifold [ step * ( iii ) * ] , the rg usually has a smaller dimension than @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , in the case of bvp ( [ hopf - eq ] ) , the symmetry group @xmath16 is defined by the four generators @xmath124 , and the rg is defined by the three generators @xmath103 .",
    "it is obvious that for the construction of the rg symmetry , it is desirable to have a maximal group @xmath16 .",
    "however , the more complicated the basic equations are , the narrower the admissible transformation group typically is .",
    "for instance , if the term @xmath125 accounting for dissipation is added to the hopf equation , then after the change of variables @xmath126 , we obtain the modified burgers equation . for this equation ,",
    "the admissible symmetry group is infinite - dimensional , but it is now characterized by a single arbitrary function instead of four functions for the hopf equation , and after the reduction procedure , we obtain a finite - dimensional ( 8-dimensional ) rg @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the rg symmetry can not be constructed using a point symmetry group for the basic manifold alone because restricting on a particular solution yields a zero - dimensional group . in this case",
    ", we must either modify ( and simplify ) the system of equations used for the description of the physical process or use other symmetries in addition to lie symmetries for constructing the rg .",
    "we now demonstrate various approaches to the construction of the rg symmetry for the bvp obtained by complicating the problem in ( [ hopf - eq ] ) , which was our example of the construction of the rg symmetry in section  [ illustration ] .",
    "we consider the following problem , which was historically the first example of a successful application of the rg algorithm .",
    "this is the interaction of @xmath127-polarized electromagnetic radiation with a frequency @xmath128 and a moderate ( by today s standards ) intensity , with inhomogeneous plasma @xcite .",
    "this interaction is described by a system of 2-dimensional nonstationary differential equations ( the equations of the collisionless hydrodynamics of electron plasma with a self - consistent electromagnetic field ) for six functions : the components @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath131 of the magnetic and the electric fields , two components @xmath132 , @xmath133 of the velocity of the electrons , and their density @xmath54 ; these functions depend on three variables : the coordinates @xmath73 and @xmath134 and time @xmath78 .",
    "our aim is to obtain an approximate analytic solution of this system of equations in an arbitrary order of nonlinearity , without confining ourselves to the perturbation - theory framework .",
    "for an arbitrary ion density function @xmath135 , the basic system of equations admits only a finite - dimensional point transformation group , the group of translations along the @xmath78 and @xmath134 axes .",
    "if the ion density is a constant , @xmath136 const , then we also have the group of translations along the @xmath73 axis and the group of simultaneous rotations in the three planes defined by the coordinates @xmath137 and the corresponding @xmath73 and @xmath134 components of the velocity of the electrons and of the electric field .",
    "thus , regarding the original equations as the manifold @xmath122 , we obtain a fairly narrow admissible group , which does not allow finding the required rg symmetry .    to construct a manifold @xmath122 allowing a wider point transformation group , we use the fact that the leading contribution to nonlinear effects of the interaction of the electromagnetic wave with the inhomogeneous ( in @xmath73 ) plasma under consideration here comes from the components of the electric field and the velocity of the electrons that are directed along the density gradient .",
    "furthermore , due to the natural smallness parameters ( the smooth inhomogeneity of the ion density along the @xmath73 axis and the small angle of incidence @xmath138 of the laser beam on the plasma ) , the dependence of these components on the @xmath134 coordinate , which is transverse to the density gradient , is smoother than their dependence on @xmath73 in the neighborhood of the plasma resonance .",
    "hence , in the construction of @xmath122 , in the full system of 6 original equations , we can single out a simpler system of two one - dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations for the @xmath73 components @xmath130 of the electric field and @xmath132 of the velocity of the electrons in the neighborhood of the plasma resonance : @xmath139 here , @xmath140 and @xmath127 are the respective quantities @xmath132 and @xmath130 normalized by the parameter @xmath107 , the parameter @xmath141 is determined by the radiation flux @xmath142 on the plasma and the linear transformation coefficient , @xmath143 is the plasma frequency ( for the fixed ion density ) , and @xmath144 is the speed of light .",
    "the infinite - dimensional point transformation group in the space of 5 variables @xmath145 @xmath146 admitted by ( [ twoeq ] ) is defined by an infinitesimal operator , which is a sum of three operators : @xmath147 each of these three operators involves an arbitrary function @xmath148 of the group variables , where @xmath149 and @xmath150 satisfy the differential constraints @xmath151 to specialize the functions @xmath152 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 entering the coordinates of the operator @xmath153 , we use the procedure of restriction of the point transformation group  ( [ group - el ] ) on an approximate ( in powers of @xmath107 ) solution of the bvp .",

    "the verification of the rg - invariance conditions [ similar to ( [ invarcond - hopf ] ) ] for this approximate particular solution determines our choice of the functions @xmath154 ,  @xmath155 , and @xmath156 and yields the required rg - symmetry operator ( where the first relation in ( [ restrict-2 ] ) holds with the substitution @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 ) : @xmath160 the quantities @xmath161 , @xmath140 and @xmath127 are invariants of the rg transformations with infinitesimal operator ( [ rg - el - gen ] ) , and the transformation of the @xmath73 variable defined by the solution of the lie equation for ( [ rg - el - gen ] ) exhibits a linear dependence on the parameter @xmath107 : @xmath162 the group composition law for @xmath73 can be easily deduced from the functional equation of form ( [ funceq ] ) with the substitutions @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",

    "taking strong nonlinearities ( the influence of higher harmonics on the lower ones ) into account significantly changes the dependence of the coefficient of the transformation into harmonics emitted by the plasma on the density of the electromagnetic radiation flux falling on the plasma @xcite and the temperature of the plasma @xcite .",

    "the approximate nature of the group with infinitesimal operator ( [ rg - el - gen ] ) so obtained relative to the group ( [ group - el ] ) inducing it is determined by the inhomogeneity of the plasma ( we recall that in the derivation of operator ( [ group - el ] ) , we imposed no assumptions on eqns ( [ twoeq ] ) concerning the inhomogeneity pattern of the plasma density ) .",
    "this is similar to the situation in quantum field theory : the exact group property of a solution is used for a progressive improvement of the system of its approximation characteristics , where the next approximation improves the previous one without destroying it . from the standpoint of the rg symmetry , this means that operator ( [ rg - el - gen ] ) can be refined by accounting for the small parameters of the problem used in passing to eqns ( [ twoeq ] ) .",

    "for instance , in the simplest planar one - velocity transfer problem , the rg invariance is a property of the asymptotic form as @xmath307 of the density of particles going inside the medium @xmath308 , which does not feature in the boltzmann equation . of the solution @xmath309 of the one - velocity kinetic equation . ]    on the other hand , interesting from the physical standpoint can often be not the solution itself over the entire range of its arguments and parameters but some integral characteristic , a functional of the solution .",
    "for instance , this characteristic can be the result of averaging ( integrating ) with respect to some independent variable or of passing to another integral ( e.g. , fourier ) representation . in this case",
    ", we can use the rg algorithm to improve the functional of the approximate solution rather than to improve the particular solution and the subsequent calculation of the corresponding integral characteristic .",
    "we now present examples of the implementation of the rg algorithm in problems of mathematical physics involving nonlocal relations , which provide illustrations to both possible cases .",
    "we consider some bvp for local equations and assume that we are interested in an integral characteristic of the solution , given by a linear functional of this solution : @xmath310 we assume that for a particular solution @xmath85 of this boundary value problem , the rg algorithm has been used to find an rg symmetry with a generator @xmath223 . instead of the rg transformation group of the solution itself , we are interested in the rg transformation group of integral characteristic ( [ rgmnonloc ] ) .",
    "to find an infinitesimal generator of the group , we extend the action of the rg symmetry operator @xmath223 to nonlocal variable ( [ rgmnonloc ] ) . for this",
    ", we represent the operator in the canonical form , that is , make the substitution @xmath311 , and extend the operator to the nonlocal variable @xmath312 : @xmath313 the @xmath314 variable is related to @xmath315 by means of an integral relation @xcite ( for brevity , we write only one argument of the coordinate of the generator , the one with respect to which the integration is performed ) : @xmath316 considering operator ( [ canonic3 ] ) in the narrowed space of the variables defining the functional , we obtain the required infinitesimal rg symmetry operator for integral characteristic ( [ rgmnonloc ] ) .      to demonstrate how formulas ( [ prolong - can ] ) and ( [ canonic3 ] ) actually work for functionals of solutions of bvps , we start with our example of the bvp for the hopf equation .",
    "the algebra of rg symmetries of this problem is generated by the three operators in ( [ rg - hopf ] ) .",
    "we consider the case where we are interested not in the full solution to bvp ( [ solution - hopf ] ) for all values of its arguments and parameters but only in the value at some point of some characteristic , which can be defined by a linear functional of form ( [ rgmnonloc ] ) .",
    "for instance , we can be interested in the value of the first spatial derivative at @xmath2 : @xmath317 using perturbation theory ( [ hopf - pt1 ] ) in the right - hand side of ( [ functional ] ) yields the behavior of @xmath318 for small @xmath319 : @xmath320    + o \\left ( t^2 \\right ) , \\",
    "u_x^0 \\equiv \\partial_x u\\big\\vert_{x=0 } ,    \\",
    "u_{xx}^0 \\equiv \\partial_{xx } u\\big\\vert_{x=0 } \\,.\\ ] ] to correct the asymptotic behavior of the functional of the solution , which is distorted by perturbation theory ( [ hopf - pt2 ] ) , we can use the rg symmetry for ( [ functional ] ) . as in the derivation of solution ( [ solution - hopf ] )",
    ", we use the last generator in ( [ rg - hopf ] ) in the simplest form , with @xmath321 , and write it in the space of variables @xmath322 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath323 this operator is @xmath324 information about the behavior of the function @xmath325 in the entire range of the @xmath78 variable , including its asymptotic behavior as @xmath326 , can be obtained either with the help of ( finite ) transformations of the group with generator ( [ rg - hopf - example1 ] ) , which are similar to ( [ trans - hopf ] ) , or by using the obvious invariant @xmath327 of rg generator ( [ rg - hopf - example1 ] ) , with the initial condition @xmath328 .",
    "we emphasize that we obtain this result without explicitly finding solution ( [ solution - hopf ] ) , but only using the rg symmetry .",
    "our construction may look cumbersome at first glance ; however , in more complex problems , the solution is typically not known explicitly , but the rg symmetry can be constructed ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .      one example of a more complicated situation is the behavior of functionals of solutions of the bvp for the equations of quasi - chaplygin media ( [ kcs ] ) and , more specifically , of the quantities @xmath329 and @xmath330 on the axis @xmath2 , up to the point where a singularity occurs .",
    "we claim that this phenomenon can be investigated by applying the rg algorithm to two functionals of solutions of bvp ( [ kcs ] ) : the density @xmath331 and the derivative of the velocity @xmath332 calculated on the axis of the beam and related to the solution by the formal equalities @xmath333 the boundary conditions for functionals ( [ intensity - eikonal ] ) can be written as @xmath334 although conditions ( 64 ) give no information about the dependence of the density @xmath54 on the @xmath73 variable , such information is incorporated into the rg symmetry operator , whose explicit form is determined by the density distribution @xmath242 for @xmath220 .",
    "we consider an example of the problem with the planar geometry , with the soliton profile @xmath335 of the density distribution at the boundary , for the rg symmetry operator as in ( [ rg - liebk - kcs ] ) , ( [ rgs1_soliton ] ) . extending this operator to nonlocal variables ( [ intensity - eikonal ] ) , we obtain a simpler operator in the space @xmath336 @xcite : @xmath337 the rg invariance condition @xmath338 for operator ( [ rgs - pr - sol ] ) leads to an ordinary second - order differential equation for the function @xmath339 , which must be solved with initial conditions ( [ boundary - func ] ) and the additional condition @xmath340 for the first derivative , which follows from the original equations ( [ kcs ] ) for @xmath2 .",
    "this solution @xmath341 reproduces the result obtained in ( [ res1_soliton ] ) , but the method is simpler and solution ( [ res1_soliton ] ) is not explicitly required .",
    "we note that the procedure of extending rg generators represented as infinitesimal operators of a point group or a lie - backhand group is universal , and hence we have a common framework for the description of the behavior of characteristics of solutions of bvps ( [ hopf ] ) and ( [ kcs ] ) alike , if we use the reduced description in terms of functionals of solutions .",
    "[ plasma - dyn ]    we now consider the construction of the rg symmetry in the problem where nonlocal relations are involved in the definition of the basic manifold .",
    "we discuss the problem of an expanding plasma bunch in the quasineutral approximation @xcite . in this approximation",
    ", the dynamics of plasma particles in the planar geometry are determined by solutions of kinetic equations for the distribution functions @xmath342 of the different kinds of particles ( electrons and ions ) : @xmath343 with additionally imposed nonlocal constraints arising from the conditions of the vanishing current and charge density ( the quasineutrality conditions ) : @xmath344 the electric field is here expressed in terms of moments of the distribution functions : @xmath345 the initial conditions for system ( [ bunch - kin ] ) , ( [ quasineutral ] ) correspond to the distribution functions of electrons and ions at the instant @xmath75 : @xmath346 to construct the rg symmetry , we regard the system of local ( [ bunch - kin ] ) and nonlocal ( [ quasineutral ] ) equations as the manifold @xmath122 ( step * i * of the rg algorithm ) , on which the electric field @xmath347 is to be determined .",
    "the calculation of the lie group of point transformations admitted by this manifold ( step * ( ii ) * of the rg algorithm ) defines a finite - dimensional algebra generated by the operators of time and space shifts , the galilean transformation operator , three dilation operators , the quasineutrality operator , and the operator of the projective group .",
    "the restriction of the group ( step * ( iii ) * of the rg algorithm ) on a particular solution of problem ( [ bunch - kin ] ) , ( [ quasineutral ] ) , ( [ initial - cond ] ) with a spatially symmetric initial distribution function with zero mean velocity selects a linear combination of the time translation operator and the projective group operator . under this combination , the approximate solution of the initial problem @xmath348 provided by the perturbation theory as @xmath95 is invariant , and therefore this linear combination is the rg symmetry operator : @xmath349 the constant @xmath350 can be regarded as the ratio of the characteristic sound speed @xmath351 to the initial inhomogeneity scale of the plasma density @xmath352 .",
    "the invariants of rg operator ( [ rg - oper ] ) are given by the distribution functions of the particles @xmath353 and the combinations @xmath354 and @xmath355 .",
    "hence , the construction of a solution of the bvp ( step * ( iv ) * of the rg algorithm ) reduces to expressing the distribution functions at an arbitrary instant @xmath356 in terms of initial data ( [ initial - cond ] ) with the help of these invariants , @xmath357 where the dependence of @xmath358 on @xmath359 is determined by quasineutrality conditions ( [ quasineutral ] ) .",
    "a concrete example illustrating these formulas for a plasma layer formed by a group of hot and cold electrons and two kinds of ions can be found in @xcite .",
    "applications of the rg symmetry operator are not confined to the construction of solutions of an initial value problem for eqns ( [ bunch - kin ] ) , ( [ quasineutral ] ) or to finding the corresponding distribution functions of particles . for practical purposes , more rough characteristics of the plasma dynamics",
    "is often needed , for instance , the density of the particles ( ions ) of a certain kind @xmath360 , which can be found by integrating the distribution function : @xmath361 straightforward integration of the distribution function with respect to the velocity can not always be performed analytically because this function may have a complicated dependence on the invariant @xmath362 . in this case",
    ", we can use the extension of the rg symmetry operator to a functional of the solution because the density @xmath360 is a linear functional of @xmath363 .",
    "the extension of operator ( [ rg - oper ] ) to functional ( [ integral - def ] ) yields the following operator in the narrowed space of the variables @xmath364 : @xmath365 the solution of the lie equations for operator ( [ rg - n ] ) with initial conditions ( [ initial - cond ] ) taken into account yields a relation between the invariants of this operator ( one of the invariants , @xmath366 , coincides with the above - mentioned invariant of operator ( [ rg - oper ] ) , and the other invariant is @xmath367 at an arbitrary instant @xmath98 to their values at the initial instant @xmath220 : @xmath368 , @xmath369 .",
    "this relation immediately gives formulas describing the space - time distribution of the density of the ions of given species in terms of their initial density distribution : @xmath370 we note that the function @xmath371 also characterizes the energy spectral distribution of ions for large times @xmath372 @xcite .",
    "thus , the use of the rg algorithm not only allows constructing a solution of problem ( [ bunch - kin ] ) , ( [ quasineutral ] ) , ( [ initial - cond ] ) for various initial distribution functions of particles @xcite but also permits finding the law of the evolution of their density and their energy spectrum without calculating the distribution functions of the particles explicitly .",
    "similar results are obtained not only in the framework of the model of a planar one - dimensional expansion but also , for instance , for a spherically symmetric expansion of a plasma bunch @xcite .",
    "we now expound on several important points related to the development and applications of the rg algorithm to bvps of mathematical physics .    first of all , we note its universality , meaning that the procedure for the construction and the use of rg symmetries is implemented in accordance with the scheme described in section  [ illustration ] .",
    "of course , approaches to the realization of the steps of the algorithm can be different depending on the type of the problem under consideration , but the general pattern of four successive steps remains the same .",
    "our method not merely allows reproducing already known solutions in a regular fashion but also produces new solutions .",
    "second , the above examples do not exhaust all possible ways of implementing the rg algorithm .",
    "there is an especially large freedom at the first step , that is , in the construction of the original manifold .",
    "we have restricted ourself to the description of the most typical approaches ( extending the list of independent variables , using higher symmetries , applying the techniques of approximate symmetries ) .",
    "we left the detailed description of the construction of the basic manifold with the use of additional differential constraints and methods for the derivation of these constraints on the basis of higher symmetries @xcite outside the scope of this paper .",
    "one special case of a differential relation defining a boundary condition is the embedding equation ; this is particularly interesting in mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations for which the problem of symmetry calculation is nontrivial @xcite .",
    "we also left the use of multiparameter renormalization groups @xcite , the construction of approximate rg symmetries involving a small parameter in the transformation @xcite , and integration with respect to the rg - transformation parameter @xcite without detailed speculation . for a detailed discussion of these issues and for applications of rg symmetries ,",
    "the reader can consult reviews  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "third , we note that methods of computer algebra can be used for the construction of rg symmetries . in the framework of",
    "the general scheme of the rg algorithm , one of the central computational procedures is finding a maximal symmetry group of the manifold @xmath122 . here , it is necessary to derive and solve a system of determining equations , which are linear ( in the coordinates of the infinitesimal operators ) ordinary or partial differential equations .",
    "this usually amounts to routine calculations , the bulk of which becomes quite large for higher - order symmetries and which can not be performed by hand in a reasonably short time ; psychologically , this can be a factor constraining the use of the rg algorithm .",
    "however , by using methods of computer algebra at the second step of the algorithm , often allows considerably accelerating the construction of rg symmetries , as was shown in the example of the calculation of rg symmetries for equations of quasi - chaplygin media @xcite .",
    "the prospective gains can be at their greatest if analytic and symbolic calculations are combined , when _ a priori _ information about the form of the rg symmetry extracted from analytic investigations can considerably reduce the time required for symbolic calculations . methods of symbolic calculations can be used for exact and approximate rg symmetries alike , which significantly enhances the potentialities of the rg algorithm in general . at the same time , analytic approaches used in constructing rg symmetries can be helpful in the development of new algorithms for computer algebra systems .    finally , we indicate possible ways to extend the scope of applications of the rg algorithm",
    ". this can be achieved by covering new objects for which the use of the rg algorithm is not yet standard or by modifying the algorithm itself .",
    "one example of a new object can be an infinite system of coupled integrodifferential equations similar to systems for correlation functions in statistical physics or to systems of equations for generalized green s functions , propagators , and vertex functions in quantum field theory .",
    "as concerns modifications of the algorithm , they are connected in a natural way with the general progress in the modern group analysis .",
    "this is how it became possible to extend the rg algorithm ( developed originally for physical problems described by differential equations ) to nonlocal problems .",
    "certain hopes in this direction are related to the progress in group analysis in application to generalized functions @xcite , further developing the theory of approximate symmetries @xcite , finding new relations between the concept of symmetry and conservation laws @xcite , progress of the theory of partial - invariant solutions @xcite , and applying group analysis to difference @xcite and functional @xcite equations .",
