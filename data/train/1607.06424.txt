    "* a general question . * when one is given a weighted graph ( or an electric network ) , what are the natural random metrics or pseudo - metrics that one can define on them ?",
    "this simple question is of course not new and has given rise to a number of works , and in the continuum , the definition of random metrics is sometimes described in theoretical physics under the name of quantum gravity ( see eg .",
    "the references in @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    ", we will define and describe a simple and fairly natural random pseudo - metric on an electric network , point out some of its nice features , and briefly discuss some conjectures about scaling limits , in particular in the two - dimensional case .",
    "when @xmath0 is a standard one - dimensional brownian motion started from @xmath1 and @xmath2 denotes its local time at zero , then it is well - known ( it is one of the many results by paul lvy about brownian motion , see for instance theorem 2.3 , chapter vi ,  2 in @xcite ) , that the process @xmath3 is distributed exactly like @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a standard brownian motion and @xmath6 } w_s$ ] .",
    "it can be viewed as a direct consequence of tanaka s formula @xmath7 ; indeed , this shows that @xmath8 is a brownian motion and it is easy to check that @xmath9 } w$ ] .",
    "this is also closely related to the so - called skorokhod reflection lemma ( see also @xcite ) .    before explaining our generalization of this result to general metric graphs ,",
    "let us first describe the special case of the segment @xmath10 $ ] ( the previous brownian case corresponds in fact to the case where @xmath11 is infinite ) , which is due to bertoin and pitman @xcite . instead of brownian motion , we now consider @xmath12}$ ] to be a brownian bridge with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fixed and non - negative . for @xmath17 $ ] , we then define @xmath18 } w , \\min_{[t , t ] } w ) $ ] ( see figure [ bbridge ] ) .",
    "we also consider another brownian bridge @xmath19 on @xmath10 $ ] from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , that we use to define the `` reflected brownian bridge '' @xmath20 .",
    "we can then define the local time at @xmath1 process @xmath21 of this reflected bridge ( or equivalently of @xmath19 ) . for each @xmath17 $ ] , we define @xmath22 , l[t , t])$ ]",
    ". then ( see theorem 4.1 in @xcite ) , the process @xmath23}$ ] is distributed exactly like @xmath5 and the process @xmath24}$ ] is distributed like @xmath25 .",
    "hence , we see that lvy s theorem has also a more symmetric version , and does not rely on the orientation of the real line . in this setting , it is therefore possible to construct a ( non - reflected ) brownian bridge @xmath5 from a reflected brownian bridge @xmath20 by using the latter s local time at @xmath1 .",
    "( in dashed ) and of the corresponding process @xmath26 ( in plain  the two colors correspond to the portions before and after the minimum of the bridge ) .",
    "the generalization of lvy s theorem by bertoin and pitman @xcite states that the difference between the two is distributed like a reflected brownian bridge @xmath20 from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , and that conversely , one can recover @xmath5 from @xmath20 . ]",
    "note that it is easy started from @xmath27 , one knows from the reflection principle @xcite the joint law of @xmath28 , from which one can deduce the law of @xmath29 by lvy s theorem .",
    "we note that by reflection , the laws of @xmath30 and of @xmath31 coincide while @xmath32 implies that @xmath33 has the same sign as @xmath27 . from this",
    ", one can deduce the joint law of @xmath34 , and by conditioning on the value of @xmath33 , one gets the law of @xmath35 for the brownian bridge . ] to compute the law of @xmath35 , @xmath36 for all @xmath37 ( see for instance @xcite , page 155 , formula 1.3.8 ) .",
    "note that this formula holds regardless of the signs of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath15 and @xmath16 have the same sign , then the probability that @xmath35 is positive is @xmath38 ( which is the probability that the bridge touches @xmath1 ) , but @xmath35 is almost surely positive when @xmath15 and @xmath16 have opposite signs . a very special case is when @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is distributed like an exponential variable with mean @xmath41 .",
    "* gff on metric graphs background .",
    "* when one is given a finite connected undirected graph @xmath42 consisting of a set of vertices @xmath43 , a set of edges @xmath44 where each edge @xmath45 is also equipped with a positive and finite conductance @xmath46 , one can define a natural continuous - time markov chain ( that we will refer to as the continuous - time random walk ) on the graph , and the related notion of harmonic functions .",
    "if one is given a non - empty subset @xmath47 of @xmath43 , one can view @xmath47 as a boundary and one can then define the gff with zero - boundary conditions on @xmath47 to be the centered gaussian process on @xmath43 , with covariance given by the green s function of the random walk killed upon reaching @xmath47 .",
    "more generally , when @xmath48 is a given function on @xmath47 , one can define the gff @xmath49 with boundary conditions @xmath48 on @xmath47 to be the sum of the aforementioned gff with zero boundary conditions on @xmath47 , with the deterministic harmonic extension of @xmath48 to @xmath43 ( i.e. , the function that is equal to @xmath48 on @xmath43 and is harmonic at all other vertices ) .",
    "as explained and used in @xcite , it can be very useful to respectively couple random walks and the gff on such a discrete graph with brownian motion and the gff on the metric graph that is naturally associated to it ( in particular when relating the gff to the so - called loop - soups on those graphs ) .",
    "this metric graph is the structure @xmath50 that one obtains when one replaces formally each edge @xmath45 by a one - dimensional segment of length @xmath51 .",
    "a point @xmath52 in the metric graph is therefore either a vertex in @xmath43 or a point on one of these segments .",
    "one can then easily define brownian motion on this metric graph ( loosely speaking , it moves like one - dimensional brownian motion on the segments , and when at a vertex , it locally chooses to do excursions in each of the incoming segments uniformly ) .",
    "the trace of this brownian motion on the sites of the graph ( when parametrized by its local time at these sites ) is then exactly the continuous - time random walk on the discrete graph , and the green s functions on the metric graph does coincide with that of this continuous - time random walk , when looked at the vertices in @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , this shows that one can define the gff @xmath53 on the metric graph ( with boundary @xmath47 ) in two equivalent ways : either directly , as the gaussian process with covariance function given by the green s function of the brownian motion on the metric graph .",
    "the field @xmath53 is then a strong markov field on @xmath50 ( @xcite ) . or alternatively , by first sampling the discrete gff @xmath49 on the discrete graph @xmath54 , which provides the value of @xmath53 when restricted to the sites of @xmath43 .",
    "then one has , for each edge @xmath45 to `` fill in '' the values of the gff , using independent brownian bridges ( the time - length of the bridge is the length of this interval , and the values of the bridges at the end - points are given by the values of the gff on the vertices ) .    as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "considering the metric graph allows to describe the conditional law of the gff @xmath53 given its absolute value @xmath55 ( or equivalently given its square @xmath56 , which is a quantity that is naturally connected to loop - soups , see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , one can easily make sense of the excursions away from @xmath1 by @xmath55 on the metric graph , and conditionally on @xmath55 , the signs of these excursions are just i.i.d .",
    "this makes it very natural to study further what one can do using the local time at @xmath1 of @xmath55 , which is of course closely related to these excursions .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper , which will illustrate the fact that on metric graphs , a number of identities and tricks related to one - dimensional brownian motions , bridges or exursions ( see @xcite ) can be adapted and shed some light on important features of the gff in higher dimensions .    * some results of the present paper .",
    "* let us consider a real - valued function @xmath48 on the boundary @xmath47 , and the gff @xmath53 on the metric graph with condition @xmath48 on @xmath47 .    .",
    "]    on each edge , conditionally on the value of @xmath53 on the vertices , this process is a brownian bridge , and it is therefore almost surely possible to define its local time at the level zero ( on each of the edges ) .",
    "we now use this local time to define the following pseudo - metric .",
    "given @xmath52 and @xmath57 two points in the metric graph , the distance @xmath58 is the infimum over all continuous paths @xmath59 joining @xmath52 to @xmath57 of the local time at @xmath1 accumulated along this path . even though we will use the word `` distance '' throughout the paper , we stress that the mapping @xmath60 is in fact a pseudo - metric on the metric graph ( and therefore also on the original graph ) : two points are at distance zero from each other if and only if they belong to the same connected component of the non - zero set of @xmath61 . for each @xmath52 in the metric graph",
    ", we consider the distance @xmath62 to the boundary set @xmath47 induced by the above pseudo - metric ( again , mind that @xmath63 can be zero even if @xmath64 ) .",
    "note that the quantities @xmath65 and @xmath63 can in fact be viewed as functionals of the absolute value of the gff i.e. of the field @xmath55 .    .",
    "]    similarly , when we are given the field @xmath53 , we can define for each @xmath52 in the metric graph , the quantity @xmath66 to be the supremum over all continuous paths connecting @xmath52 to @xmath47 of the minimum of @xmath53 along this path , and then finally , @xmath67 .",
    "the processes @xmath63 and @xmath68 can be viewed as the metric graph generalisations of the local time process ( of reflected brownian motion and of the reflected brownian bridge ) and of the infinum process ( of brownian motion and brownian bridges ) that appear in lvy s result and its afore - mentioned generalization to brownian bridges .",
    "( in plain ) .",
    "proposition [ thmgeneralisedlevy ] says in particular that the difference between the two is a reflected gff with the same boundary conditions , and that one can recover this picture from this reflected gff .",
    "the different colors correspond to the `` bassins of attraction '' of the four boundary points , and the crosses do separate these four regions . ]",
    "the following generalisation of lvy s theorem to metric graphs will be the main result of section [ s2 ] in the present paper :    [ thmgeneralisedlevy ] consider a finite graph @xmath69 , a non - negative function @xmath48 defined on a non - empty subset @xmath47 of @xmath43 , @xmath53 the metric graph gff on @xmath70 with boundary condition @xmath48 on @xmath47 , and define the processes @xmath71 and @xmath72 as before .",
    "then the two pairs of processes @xmath73 and @xmath74 have the same law .",
    "in particular , this shows that the field @xmath75 has the same distribution as @xmath61 . as in lvy s theorem , one can therefore construct deterministically a gff from the absolute value of a gff .    in section [ s3 ] , will then point out features of some functionals of the pseudo - metric that we now briefly illustrate : consider a partition of the boundary @xmath47 into two non - empty sets @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and suppose that the boundary condition @xmath48 has a constant sign on each of @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( it does not have to be the same sign on both sets )",
    ". then we can define the pseudo - distance between @xmath78 and @xmath79 to be the infimum over all paths that join a point of @xmath78 to a point in @xmath79 , of the cumulative local time along this path .",
    "it turns out that its law is invariant if we modify the network @xmath69 into an electrically equivalent circuit , seen simultaneously from all boundary points in @xmath47 .",
    "a subcase of the general result ( proposition [ thmdist2sets ] ) that will be given in section [ s3 ] goes as follows :    [ proplaw2points ] when @xmath47 contains only two points @xmath80 and @xmath81 , then the law of the distance @xmath82 depends only on the _ effective resistance _",
    "@xmath83 of the electric network between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this law is therefore given by formula , where @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "however , as we shall point out , it is easy to see that for the joint law of the distance between more than two boundary points , there is no such simple identity .",
    "indeed , the laws of joint distances between three points turn out not to be invariant under local y-@xmath89 transformations ( i.e. , star - delta transformations ) which do however preserve all resistances between boundary points .",
    "it is also possible to use this pseudo - distance @xmath71 to define and study interesting random sets .",
    "suppose that @xmath48 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are as before .",
    "for each @xmath90 , define @xmath91 to be the set of points @xmath52 in the metric graph , for which there exists a continuous path joining @xmath52 to @xmath76 such that @xmath92 along the path .",
    "note that @xmath91 is a random compact connected set containing @xmath76",
    ". we can call it _ the first hitting set of level _",
    "@xmath93 from @xmath78 .",
    "optional set _ for the metric graph gff @xmath61 , that is to say that given @xmath94 a deterministic compact subset of @xmath70 , the event @xmath95 is measurable with respect the restriction of @xmath61 to @xmath94 ( this is also closely related to the fact that @xmath91 is a _",
    "local set _ for the gff @xmath61 , see @xcite ) .    , in thick lines .",
    "boundary components are surrounded by dashed lines . ]",
    "we will study the distribution of the effective resistance @xmath96 between the subsets @xmath91 and @xmath77 in the electrical network @xmath70 . note that this resistance is zero if and only if @xmath91 intersects @xmath77 , and that only the connected components of @xmath97 that intersect @xmath77 matter to determine @xmath96 .",
    "we will for instance compute the laplace transform of the effective conductance @xmath98 in the case where @xmath48 is constant on @xmath77 .    * further comments on the two - dimensional case . * while all the above considerations are not restricted to any particular dimensions ( and in a way , this is one punchline of the present setup ) , one of the motivations for the present work comes from the very special two - dimensional case and the study of the gff in continuous two - dimensional domains . recall that in two dimensions , conformal invariance is a powerful additional property of the gff .",
    "a lot of geometric properties and features of the gff have been recently obtained using sle , and some of them turn out to be closely related to properties of brownian loop - soups ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "these results have been essentially obtained for the gff in simply connected domains ( where sle tools are more easily applicable ) , and by local absolute continuity , they also provide some results ( existence of level lines etc ) on more general surfaces .",
    "explicit formulas ( for probabilities of events for instance ) have also been produced in simply connected domains , using sle techniques , but these appear difficult to extend to more general surfaces .",
    "the gff on metric graphs approach has recently been shown to provide an alternative and useful approach to level lines of the continuum gff in two dimensions ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the present paper do involve quantities ( typically the effective resistance ) that have nice conformally invariant counterparts in the appropriate scaling limits .",
    "indeed , taking the formal scaling limit of our computations in the simply connected case leads to known results for the continuous gff . in section [ s4 ] , we will :    * briefly review the relation between the gff on metric graphs , loop - soups and the conformal loop ensembles cle@xmath99 and the continuous gff . *",
    "explain why the scaling limit of our pseudo - distance should be the distance between cle@xmath99 loops that has been recently introduced and studied by sheffield , watson and wu @xcite and by werner and wu @xcite , and why this could provide an alternative approach to some of its properties .",
    "* give examples of formulae that conjecturally hold for the gff ( and the scaling limit of the pseudo - distance ) on bordered riemann surfaces , that seem out of the scope of sle techniques . here , _",
    "extremal distance _",
    "( see @xcite , section 4 , and @xcite ) is ( not surprisingly ) the natural conformal invariant that appears in the scaling limit to describe these conjectural laws .",
    "[ s2 ]      in this section we will establish proposition [ thmgeneralisedlevy ] .",
    "we will do this with a stochastic calculus - type proof , as will also smoothly lead to our further results .",
    "however , in the present subsection , we first describe informally another possible proof , based on a discretisations . one goal of this informal discussion is to explain that the generalisation of lvy s theorem should by no means be thought of as surprising ( however , as the reader will probably realise , turning this informal description into a rigorous proof would require some technical work ) .",
    "another goal is to introduce some of the ideas ( such as simultaneous explorations of the values of the field when starting from the boundary ) that will be used in the continuous setting .",
    "let us briefly recall the following approach to lvy s theorem via discretisation .",
    "when @xmath100 denotes a simple random walk , one can define the hitting times @xmath101 of negative integers @xmath102 .",
    "then , one can decompose the path of @xmath103 into i.i.d .",
    "pieces @xmath104 , where @xmath105 denotes the portion of @xmath106 between @xmath107 and @xmath101 .",
    "they are distributed each like a simple random walk started from @xmath41 and stopped at their first hitting of @xmath1 . hence , if we define @xmath108 to be @xmath105 with an additional first upwards step from @xmath1 to @xmath41 , and then concatenates these @xmath105 , one gets exactly a reflected random walk ( i.e. , distributed like @xmath109 ) .",
    "conversely , starting from this reflected random walk , one can easily recover @xmath103 by erasing all its upwards moves from level @xmath1 to level @xmath41 , and then concatenating the obtained pieces .",
    "hence , in the discrete case , one has in fact a bijective transformation between the reflected random walk and the random walk .",
    "when one lets the number of steps grow to infinity ( and renormalises appropriately , so that the random walk approaches a brownian motion ) , then it is not difficult to see that this transformation converges to the identity in lv s theorem ( indeed , the appropriately renormalised number of visits to the origin by the reflected random walk will converge to the local time at the origin of the limiting brownian motion ) .",
    "if one now wants to use this idea to derive the result for the one - dimensional brownian bridge on a single segment @xmath10 $ ] that we described in the introduction , one can use the very same idea , `` discovering '' the random walk bridge from its two ends simultaneously .",
    "this time , the different pieces of the random walk will not be independent anymore , but one still has a one - to - one correspondence between a random walk bridge and a reflected random walk bridge .",
    "a new apparent difficulty arises because the total number of steps of the random walk bridge ( say @xmath110 ) is not the same as the total number of steps of the reflected bridge ( indeed , one has added a certain number of forward upward moves from @xmath1 to @xmath41 , and of the same number of backward upward moves from @xmath1 to @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , when @xmath111 , this number will be of order @xmath112 , and one can therefore resolve this problem by first choosing @xmath113 uniformly at random in @xmath114 $ ] and then let @xmath115 tend to infinity : in this way , one has , for each @xmath115 , a bijective correspondence between a random walk bridge of length @xmath110 , and a random path , which ( with a total variation probability @xmath116 as @xmath117 ) is close to a reflected random walk bridge of length @xmath118 ( where @xmath119 is distributed like @xmath113 ) . letting then @xmath115 tend to infinity , and using the invariance principle ( and the local central limit theorem , so that the discrete bridges converge to brownian bridges )",
    ", one can fairly easily derive the generalisation of lvy s theorem in the case of a single segment .    a generalization to the case of metric graphs as stated in proposition [ thmgeneralisedlevy ]",
    "can be obtained along similar lines .",
    "one divides for instance each segment @xmath45 of the metric graph into a large number of discrete edges chosen uniformly in @xmath120 $ ] , with the constraint that every cycle in the graph must have even length .",
    "the approximation of the gaussian field on the metric graph , by the ( renormalised ) discrete integer - valued field on this discrete graph is then the uniform measure on all integer - valued functions @xmath121 on the discretised graph , with the constraint that the values of @xmath122 at any two neighbouring points always differ exactly by one , and with prescribed even values at the boundaries .",
    "the local central limit theorem also ensures that ( when @xmath115 becomes large ) , the probabilities of two given possible outcomes does in fact not depend much on the exact outcome of the number of edges .",
    "then , again , by discovering the values of this discrete field starting from the boundary , one gets for each @xmath115 a bijection between the pair @xmath123discretisation of the graph , discrete field@xmath124 and a pair given by @xmath123discretisation of the graph , reflected discrete field@xmath124 , where the latter is ( in absolute variation ) close to the former where one just changes the field into its absolute value . letting @xmath115 tend to infinity , and using the invariance principle , the local central limit theorem as well as the fact",
    ", one can obtain proposition  [ thmgeneralisedlevy ] .",
    "of course , we have omitted here quite a number of technical steps in this informal description .      in the present subsection",
    ", we make a few elementary remarks concerning electric networks and their relations to gff , and we also put down some important notation . when one considers a finite electric network ( ie . here ,",
    "only a graph where the edges @xmath45 have conductances @xmath125 ) , and one chooses two vertices @xmath126 and @xmath127 , then one can define the equivalent or effective conductance @xmath128 of the network between these two points .",
    "this means that for all purposes that do only involve the quantities related to @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the network behaves exactly like the network with just one edge with conductance @xmath128 joining @xmath126 to @xmath127 ( see eg .",
    "@xcite for background on electric networks and their relations to random walks ) .    when we are now given a set @xmath129 of vertices in the graph that contains more than two elements , it is also easy to see that there exists a unique symmetric matrix @xmath130 indexed by @xmath131 in @xmath132 , such that for all purposes that involve quantities related to the vertices in @xmath129 , the network behaves exactly like the network consisting of the sites @xmath129 and edges joining these sites in such a way that the conductance of the edge between @xmath52 and @xmath57 is @xmath133 ( with the constraint that @xmath134 is always zero ) .",
    "we will refer to this matrix as the effective conductance matrix of @xmath129 in this network , and we will denote it by @xmath135 . it should be stressed that in general , the quantity @xmath136 is not equal to the previous `` two - point '' effective conductance @xmath137 .",
    "some readers may actually probably prefer to think of the matrix @xmath138 as a boundary excursion kernel ( and this interpretation will indeed be useful later ) .",
    "indeed , one can define the natural brownian excursion measure @xmath139 away from @xmath129 in the metric graph as the limit when @xmath140 of the sum over all points @xmath57 located exactly at distance @xmath141 of @xmath47 , of @xmath142 times the law of brownian motion on the metric graph , started at @xmath57 and stopped at its first hitting of @xmath129 .",
    "this is then an infinite measure on brownian paths in the metric graph , that start on @xmath129 and end on @xmath129 , and stay away from @xmath129 during the interior of their life - time .",
    "the mass of the excursions that start and end at the same point @xmath143 is infinite , but the mass of the excursions that start at @xmath52 and end at another point @xmath144 in @xmath129 is finite .",
    "it is an easy exercise ( one way would be to notice that it is obvious in the case where there are no other vertices than @xmath129 in the graph , and that this mass does not change under local star to complete graph transformations ) to check that this mass is in fact exactly @xmath136 .",
    "hence , @xmath136 is in fact really the metric graph version of the boundary poisson excursion kernel in the metric graph with boundary @xmath129 , and the notation @xmath145 could be equally ( or more ) appropriate for it .",
    "this effective conductance matrix is very closely related to the gff .",
    "for instance , one can consider the previous electric network with a non - empty boundary @xmath47 , and a real - valued function @xmath48 defined on @xmath47 .",
    "it is then possible to define the gff @xmath53 in the graph , with boundary condition @xmath48 on @xmath47 .",
    "we then consider another finite set @xmath146 of other distinct points in the graph , and we would like to describe the joint law of @xmath53 on @xmath147 .",
    "then , it is easy to see that the gaussian density of @xmath148 will be described via the effective conductance matrix @xmath149 , and more precisely , that it will be proportional to @xmath150    we are now going to use natural ways to discover the gff on the metric graph , by exploring it starting from part of the boundary .",
    "this strategy is again reminiscent of the schramm - sheffield theory of local sets as in @xcite .",
    "but of course , in the present metric graph setting , one is in the realm of usual stochastic calculus .",
    "the idea will again be to consider multiple particles evolving on the metric graph , all starting from the boundary , in such a way that at any given time , all particles will be at the same @xmath151 distance from the boundary .",
    "the particles will progressively discover the gff .",
    "we will write the stochastic differential equation for @xmath152 and for @xmath153 , were @xmath154 stands for the multiple evolving particles , and check that it is the same in both cases .",
    "let us briefly recall the setup : we consider a finite graph @xmath155 and @xmath47 a non - empty subset of @xmath43 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath44 contains no edges that joins a site of @xmath47 directly to another site of @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath156 be the edges adjacent to @xmath47 ie .",
    "that connect a site of @xmath47 to a site in @xmath157 .",

    "let us first make a few further comments .",
    "* in all these statements , edges of the graph that join two points of @xmath78 ( or two points of @xmath79 ) do play no role in the distance @xmath484 , and the gff on those edges is independent from the rest for a given @xmath48 .",
    "hence , we do not need to bother about these edges .",
    "* in the special case where the graph is a three - legged `` star - graph '' @xmath490 with @xmath491 and three edges joining respectively @xmath57 to the three boundary point @xmath492 , @xmath493 and @xmath85 , then for @xmath494 , it is easy to check directly that proposition [ thmdist2sets ] holds : indeed , @xmath495 and one can first sample @xmath496 and because these three random edge - lengths are then conditionally independent , one can conclude . *",
    "the previous case of the star - graph @xmath490 shows that the law of @xmath484 in this case is identical to that when the star - graph is replaced by the electrically equivalent triangle graph .",
    "+    + in fact , the previous observation can be immediately generalized to the case of star graphs @xmath497 with more boundary points ( when the graph consists only of edges joining one single central point @xmath57 to each boundary point in @xmath498 but this time , the number @xmath113 of sites of @xmath47 can be greater than @xmath499 ) . in that case , replacing this graph by the complete graph on @xmath47 with the same effective resistances will also not change the law of @xmath484 .",
    "recall that the electrical network defined by @xmath42 can always be `` reduced '' to the electrically equivalent network ( viewed from @xmath47 ) consisting only of edges joining directly the edges of @xmath47 , by a finite iteration of local `` star @xmath497 to complete graph '' transformations",
    "( at each step , one chooses a site that is not in @xmath47 and removes it using this transformation ) .",
    "proving proposition [ reformulation ] is therefore equivalent to showing that the law of @xmath484 remains unchanged under each of such local transformation .",
    "one may wonder if one simple direct proof of this fact might just be to see that if one conditions on the values of the gff outside of the considered star ( which is the same before and after the local transformation ) , then the conditional law of @xmath484 remains unchanged under this local transformation . in the coming few paragraphs , we now explain that this is _ not _ the case  this will also provide some justification for the actual strategy of our proof .",
    "let us first consider the case where the graph @xmath42 is just a three - legged star with @xmath500 and the inner point @xmath57 as before .",
    "this set is electrically equivalent to a triangle graph @xmath501 consisting only of three edges joining the points of @xmath47 .",
    "it is easy to see that it is _ not true _ that for any non - negative boundary condition @xmath48 , the joint law of the couple @xmath502 is the same for both graphs ( recall that the proposition only states than the minimum of these two quantities have the same law for both graphs ) .",
    "indeed , one can for instance consider the case where @xmath48 is constant and equal to @xmath93 on @xmath47 , and look at the asymptotic behavior when @xmath503 of the probability that @xmath504 on each of the graphs .",
    "one can directly compute and compare these probabilities , but one can also proceed heuristically as follows : for @xmath504 to hold on the triangle graph , we see that the gff has to be positive on each of the three edges , and it is easy to check that when @xmath503 , this occurs with a probability equivalent to a constant times @xmath505 ( basically , each of the gff s is starting from @xmath93 near the three boundary points and has to avoid the origin ) . on the other hand , one the triangle graph , @xmath504 if and only the gff is positive on two of the three edges , which occurs with a probability equivalent to a constant times @xmath506 ( this time , for each of these two edges , the gff has to remain positive near both of the endpoints of the edge ) .",
    "hence , we see that proposition [ thmdist2sets ] can not be generalized to statements that involve the joint law of more than two more than one distance between parts of the boundary .",
    "one could nevertheless wonder ( and this would indicate that the proof of proposition [ thmdist2sets ] via conditioning and local rewirings could work ) whether the following more general general result could hold : suppose that we are now given a non - negative function @xmath507 on @xmath47 , and we define @xmath508 then , is it the case that for each given @xmath507 and @xmath48 , the law of this quantity is invariant under the rewiring procedure described in proposition [ reformulation ] ? again , as we shall now explain , the answer to this question is negative already in the case of the three - legged star graph : suppose that for the three - legged graph @xmath509 and its electrical equivalent triangle graph @xmath510 , with @xmath511 and each given @xmath48 and @xmath507 , the laws of @xmath512 are the same for both graphs . by definition , this would imply that for each given @xmath48 , and each @xmath479 , @xmath513 and @xmath514 , the probabilities of the event @xmath515 are the same for both graphs .",
    "this would imply that the joint law of the couple @xmath516 are the same for both graphs , but we have just argued that this is not the case .",
    "consider now the three - legged graph @xmath490 , and divide each of the two edges @xmath517 and @xmath518 into two pieces",
    "( by introducing additional vertices @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) .",
    "then , what we have just explained is that for this new graph ( with six vertices ) , the conditional distribution of @xmath519 given what happens on the edges @xmath520 and @xmath521 is _ not _ invariant under the transformation that turns the star @xmath522 into a triangle ( in that setting , the function @xmath507 can be understood in terms of the distances @xmath523 and @xmath524 that have already been discovered ) .",
    "this does therefore show that the previously mentioned possible proof of proposition [ reformulation ] via conditioning and local modifications can not work .",

    "however , the scaling limit of quantities like the effective resistance still make sense , as we now explain .",
    "a first remark is that in two dimensions and in the scaling limit , the invariance under electric rewiring of the boundary excursion kernel is closely related to conformal invariance . indeed ,",
