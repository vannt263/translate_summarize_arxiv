    "the well - known variational principle relates the concepts of measure - theoretic and topological entropy for dynamical systems , stating that the topological entropy of any dynamical system is the supremum of the measure - theoretic entropies of all invariant measures on that system . in general",
    ", there may be no measures achieving that supremum , but if the system is expansive , then at least one such measure , called a measure of maximal entropy , must exist ( @xcite ) .",
    "a topological dynamical system is said to be intrinsically ergodic ( @xcite , @xcite ) if it has a unique measure of maximal entropy .",
    "it is well - known that for @xmath7 ( i.e. one - dimensional ) subshifts , strong enough topological mixing conditions imply intrinsic ergodicity ; for instance , it was shown in @xcite that the specification property implies intrinsic ergodicity .",
    "the specification property is also clearly preserved under factor maps , which implies that for a @xmath7 subshift with specification , every factor is intrinsically ergodic . in particular , since every topologically mixing @xmath7 shift of finite type has the specification property , every such system is also intrinsically ergodic , along with all of its factors .",
    "these facts lead to a natural question ( @xcite ) , asked by thomsen , of whether every factor of a @xmath1-shift is intrinsically ergodic .",
    "this question was answered in the affirmative in @xcite , where the authors gave a new sufficient condition for intrinsic ergodicity that is preserved under factor maps .",
    "informally , their condition imposes specification on `` most words '' in the subshift , in some quantifiable way .",
    "strictly speaking , for a zero - entropy system , every invariant measure is trivially a measure of maximal entropy , and so for such systems intrinsic ergodicity is equivalent to the existence of a unique invariant measure , also known as unique ergodicity . since intrinsic ergodicity of zero - entropy systems is therefore a somewhat degenerate case , in this paper we will focus on the question of whether all positive entropy factors of a subshift are intrinsically ergodic",
    "this slight restriction of scope changes none of the context of the work described above , since all subshifts with specification and all subshifts treated in @xcite ( see proposition 2.4 there ) have positive entropy .    in the current work",
    ", we study the class of @xmath3 subshifts ( @xmath8 ) for which every positive entropy factor is intrinsically ergodic , proving two results which are somewhat surprising given the results for @xmath9 summarized above .",
    "the first is that any @xmath3 subshift with a certain topological mixing property ( see definition  [ dstardef ] ) must have a non - intrinsically ergodic factor , which is antithetical to the previously described results for @xmath9 .",

    "our second main result shows that there do exist @xmath3 subshifts ( in fact shifts of finite type ) for which every positive entropy factor is intrinsically ergodic .",
