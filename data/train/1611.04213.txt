    "recently , the explosive increasing mobile services , especially applications such as video streaming , have imposed a tremendous pressure on the data transmission over the core network . as a result , during the peak - traffic times , the communication systems are usually congested .",
    "caching system , which proactively caches some contents at the network edge during off - peak hours , is a promising solution to alleviate the congestions ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .    in order to further reduce the aforementioned congestions , maddah - ali and niesen proposed a coded caching approach based on network coding theory @xcite .",
    "particularly , they focused on a @xmath0 caching system : a single server containing @xmath1 files with the same length @xmath2 packets connects to @xmath3 users over a shared link and each user has a cache memory of size @xmath4 packets ( see fig . [ system ] ) .",
    "a coded caching scheme consists of two phases :    * placement phase during off - peak times : parts of content are placed in users cache memories independent of the user demands which are assumed to be arbitrary . * delivery phase during peak times : server sends a coded signal of at most @xmath5 packets to the users such that each user s demand is satisfied .",
    "the objective is to minimize the load @xmath5 packets , in the delivery phase for the worst - case demands . in the literature , @xmath6 is called the delivery rate .    in their seminal work @xcite ,",
    "maddah - ali and niesen proposed a determined scheme for a @xmath0 coded caching system , which is referred to as an scheme in this paper . through an elaborate uncoded placement and a coded delivery which could create multicast opportunity as much as possible",
    ", the @xmath0 an scheme can reduce the rate @xmath6 from @xmath7 of uncoded caching scheme to @xmath8 .",
    "very recently , it was shown in @xcite that an scheme has the minimum delivery rate under the constraint of uncoded cache placement .",
    "so far , many results have been obtained following @xcite , for instances , @xcite and so on .",
    "in addition , an scheme has been extensively employed in practical scenarios , for examples , decentralized version @xcite , device to device networks @xcite , online caching update @xcite and hierarchical networks @xcite , @xcite etc .    in the placement phase of an scheme",
    ", each file has to be divided into @xmath9 packetes .",
    "clearly , @xmath2 increases exponentially with the number of users @xmath3 , which would make an scheme infeasible when @xmath3 is large @xcite .",
    "therefore , designing a coded caching scheme with the minimum delivery rate for any integer @xmath2 becomes a critical issue , especially for practical implementations . in order to characterize the placement phase and delivery phase in a unified way , a new concept called @xmath10 placement delivery array ( pda ) was introduced in @xcite , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "then , a @xmath0 caching system can be realized by a @xmath10 pda .",
    "thus , it is very desirable to study optimal @xmath10 pda with minimum @xmath13 . in @xcite , yan _",
    "showed that @xmath0 an scheme is equivalent to a @xmath14 @xmath15 pda ( an pda for short throughout this paper ) with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and presented two infinite classes of pdas as well .",
    "later on , two constructions of pdas in @xcite were developed from @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , only the an pda was shown to be optimal among all the known constructions up to now .    in this paper , we concentrate on the constructions of optimal pdas from a combinatorial viewpoint .",
    "we first derive lower bounds on the value of @xmath13 . with respect to the new lower bounds",
    ", the transpose of an pda is shown to be optimal .",
    "then , we propose two kinds of recursive constructions , which lead to optimal pdas based on an pda and its transpose .",
    "most notably , optimal pdas with @xmath18 and @xmath19 for any positive integers @xmath3 and @xmath2 are obtained , and some infinite classes of optimal pdas for @xmath20 are obtained .",
