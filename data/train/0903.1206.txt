    "a natural question that arises concerns the validity of the one - layer approximation upon which our model is currently based .",
    "one way to address this issue is by comparing the model results with observations of photospheric absorption line - profile variability .",

    "the variability consists primarily of the presence of  bumps \" on the line profile that systematically change their location over time , as was first studied in detail by smith ( 1985a , 1985b ) is clearly seen .",

    "the reason why the one - layer approximation works so well in this case is that the dominant effect producing the line profile variability arises from the external gravitational perturbation , rather than from the star s internal oscillation modes .",

    "although synchronous rotation is generally assumed for the analysis of a large variety of binary systems , the uncertainties in the stellar radius , rotational velocity and orbital inclination generally allow for significant departures from the assumed corrotating state .",
    "furthermore , no star in an eccentric orbit is in synchronous rotation .",
    "hence , the presence of tidal flows on the surface of binary stars is likely to be much more prevalent than generally assumed .",
    "tidal flows produce a surface velocity field having gradients in both the azimuthal and polar directions .",
    "in addition , due to the radial dependence of tidal forces , the velocity amplitudes on the surface are larger than those in internal regions , hence also creating a rotation velocity gradient in the radial direction .",
    "all these gradients are strongly time - dependent .",
    "we suggest that the strong and rapid variations in these gradients may lead to a much larger degree of turbulence on the stellar surface than is present in synchronized binaries or single stars .",
    "it is also tempting to speculate that these effects could potentiate the appearance of localized magnetic fields ( ulmschneider & musielak 1998 ) .",
    "tidal flows lead to energy dissipation due to the associated viscous shear .",
    "the additional energy in surface layers could conceivably alter the radial temperature gradient as well as produce a non - uniform effective temperature distribution over the stellar surface .",
    "it is interesting to speculate on the possible effect that this additional energy source could produce on stellar winds .",
    "for example , since the tidal shear is not uniformly distributed over the stellar surface , the question arises as to whether @xmath1 can contribute towards enhancing the mass - loss rate .",
    "alternatively , localized magnetic fields or surface convective regions might tend to inhibit the radiatively - driven outflows at the base of the wind .",
    "hence , in extreme cases where @xmath1 is significant , our model would predict a highly non - spherically symmetric mass - loss rate .",
    "in addition , the asymmetry would be greatest near periastron passage , with a wind whose characteristics are dominated by the strong perturbations near the equatorial latitudes while near aperiastron the effects of the perturbation might be concentrated near the polar regions .",
