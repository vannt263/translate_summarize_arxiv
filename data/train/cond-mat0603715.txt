    "the equilibrium properties of homogeneous fluids of spherical particles have been extensively studied both by theory and simulation and a great deal is now known about the thermodynamic properties and the fluid structure @xcite .",

    "percus - yevick ( py ) and hypernetted chain ( hnc ) theories have now been extended , for example , by mixing closures so as to obtain identical virial and compressibility equations of state @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach has been to incorporate approximate forms for the bridge function in the hnc closure .",
    "these may take the form of a low - order virial expansion , a bridge function from a reference fluid or an approximate closure relation @xcite .",
    "while there is still work to be done , especially perhaps on a fundamental treatment of the bridge function , the foundations are rather solid . as a consequence ,",
    "one is in a good position to construct good density functionals to describe inhomogeneous fluids . a key ingredient of a density functional is an assumed form for the inhomogeneous direct correlation function .",
    "it is clearly reassuring if this quantity reduces to the known homogeneous function in the uniform limit and , for spherically symmetric particles , this is a test one may apply .",
    "the equilibrium properties of isotropic fluids of non - spherical particles are less well - characterised .",
    "there are relatively few simulation studies on the direct correlation function @xcite and little data for the cavity or bridge functions have been published ( site - site functions have been calculated for hard sphere dimers and water @xcite while the first bridge diagram has been calculated for the hard spherocylinder fluid for a number of fixed orientations @xcite ) .",
    "the py and hnc equations have been solved for axially symmetric particles ( e.g.hard ellipsoids , hard spherocylinders and truncated hard spheres ) and the general conclusion is that hnc is superior to py for significantly aspherical particles , but that there is still a substantial discrepancy between theory and simulation , especially at high density @xcite .",
    "there have been some attempts to go beyond hnc . @xcite",
    "have investigated the use of a modified verlet - bridge closure and have reported improved results .",
    "@xcite applied a non - spherical version of the rogers - young method of mixing py and hnc closures , again obtaining results for spheroids in good agreement with simulation .",
    "nevertheless the number of such studies is relatively small and , as yet , we do not have sufficient simulation and theoretical studies to claim a foundation to rival that enjoyed by spherical particles .",
    "in this paper we try to address some of these issues , using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and iet . on the simulation front , we present methodologies for calculating the direct correlation , cavity and bridge functions for isotropic fluids of axially symmetric particles using advanced mc techniques .",

    "we also examine some analytical properties of the cavity function for non - spherical hard particles and calculate the first two terms in the virial expansion of the bridge function .",

    "once this procedure has converged , eq .",

    "this involves the difference between two large quantities possibly leading to numerical difficulties .",
    "these may be avoided by a procedure outlined previously @xcite , finding @xmath64 from @xmath65 and the @xmath63 for @xmath66 are then determined by interpolation .",
    "there are two methods for the calculation of the cavity function , eq .  , either by a direct simulation of two non - interacting cavity particles @xcite or through the test - particle method based on henderson s equation @xcite .",
    "the first of these methods is more useful for large cavity separations while the second is better as @xmath66 .",
    "the direct simulation method follows from the observation that for the hard particle fluid , the cavity function may be identified as the pair distribution function for a pair of non - interacting cavities @xcite . in a mc simulation",
    "it is convenient to constrain the two cavities to be within a given range of separations @xmath67 .",
    "even so , in a normal mc simulation the probability distribution @xmath68 is likely to vary rapidly with separation @xmath67 , leading to poor sampling in the regions where the function is relatively small . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "the umbrella sampling technique is employed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27-separation of the cavities is divided into a set of overlapping windows . within each window",
    "a weight function @xmath69 is introduced into the monte carlo moves ; this function is iteratively refined so as to produce a flat sampled probability distribution .",
    "this weight may be subsequently removed to give the true probability distribution for each window and the full distribution is recovered using the self - consistent histogram method @xcite .",
    "the cavity function is , to within a multiplicative constant , equal to @xmath70 .",
    "when the cavity particles are constrained this constant can not be determined directly @xcite .",
    "however it may be found by enforcing the condition that @xmath71 when outside the overlap region @xcite .",
    "for this scheme to be effective a good choice of the weighting function is needed . for hard spheres a good choice proved to be an analytic approximation to @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "here we employ a more general method based on the wang - landau method @xcite .",
    "briefly , this is an iterative method that updates an initial guess to the weight function using a decreasing modification factor .",
    "full details are given in the appendix .",
    "the implementation used here is similar in spirit to the extended density of states method ( edos ) @xcite .",
    "the spherical harmonics coefficients @xmath73 are found in the same way as those for the pair distribution function @xmath74 .      in the canonical ensemble , henderson s equation for a system containing @xmath75 molecules",

    "the term in the angled brackets corresponds to the boltzmann factor of a molecule 0 with the interaction with another molecule 1 neglected .",
    "this may intuitively be equated to a fluid consisting of 2 non - interacting cavities and @xmath79 other molecules .",
    "additionally this is also equivalent to the calculation of the acceptance criterion in a metropolis mc simulation - the interaction between a hypothetical molecule with position @xmath80 and orientation @xmath81 and every molecule in the system apart from @xmath82 is the quantity that is calculated when an attempt is made to move molecule @xmath82 to position @xmath80 and orientation @xmath81 . so as any molecule in the system may be labelled @xmath82 the quantity in the angled brackets in eq .",
    "is calculated for every attempted mc move .",
    "this fact has been used in previous studies of atomic fluids @xcite allowing the calculation of @xmath83 at essentially no extra cost . however ,",
    "for molecular fluids , where the maximum angular displacement in a monte carlo simulation may be much smaller than @xmath84 , this would lead to poor sampling of the angular dependence @xmath83 .",
    "hence the calculation of @xmath83 proceeds by inserting a number of test particles ( labelled 0 ) in the vicinity of each molecule in the simulation ( labelled 1 ) .",
    "the boltzmann factor ( neglecting the interaction between 0 and 1 ) is then calculated . for hard molecules , as in the present case ,",
    "this is simply 0 if the test particle overlaps with any other molecule ( excluding molecule 1 ) or 1 if there are no overlaps .",

    "this is similar to the behaviour seen for @xmath183 for lennard - jones and soft sphere systems @xcite , while for the hs fluid @xmath183 approaches @xmath158 almost linearly @xcite .",
    "py theory similarly overestimates the angular @xmath91 coefficients .",
    "shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : b_d=10]-[fig : b_d=50 ] are also the bridge function calculated from simulation and from the first and second terms in the diagrammatic expansion .",
    "as can be seen at the lowest density studied ( @xmath178 ) the first - order expansion gives reasonable agreement with the simulated bridge function components , although they are underestimated relative to simulation . adding the second term in the expansion improves the agreement quite considerably . at a higher density , @xmath184 ,",
    "the agreement is less good , with the first - order expansion seriously underestimating the coefficients .",
    "again the agreement improves with the addition of the second term , in fact this diagrammatic approximation of the bridge function is better overall than the approximation obtained from the py equation . as the density increases the agreement between mc results and the truncated virial expansion worsens ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : b_d=50 ] .",
    "in this paper we have presented the calculation of the pair correlation functions @xmath15 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 for the spheroid fluid from both simulation and iet .",
    "the total and direct correlation functions have been calculated using methods previously described @xcite .",
    "the cavity function was calculated from simulation using a combination of a direct simulation method and a test - particle approach . in order to improve the sampling of @xmath1 in the direct simulation approach an umbrella sampling scheme using a weight function determined iteratively during the simulation itself is employed . from iet",
    "the cavity function is determined directly using the approximate closure relations .",
    "comparison between simulation and integral equation show , as reported before @xcite , reasonable agreement between the coefficients of the total and direct correlation functions .",
    "however theory predicts the simulated cavity function poorly , with py theory underestimating and hnc theory overestimating @xmath1 within the overlap region .",
    "this error rapidly increases with density , leading to , at the highest densities studied , errors of several orders of magnitude .",
    "the bridge function calculated from the truncated virial expansion is in good agreement with mc results at low density but significant differences appear as the density increases .",
    "the bridge function calculated from py theory follows the general shape of the mc results but the quantitative agreement is poor .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "this work presents the first calculation of both the full bridge and cavity functions for molecular fluids from simulation . as the approximate closure relations used in integral equation theory correspond to approximations to the bridge function , knowledge of its exact form will",
    ", hopefully , be of great benefit in developing improved theories of molecular fluids .",
    "la and ajm thanks aurelian perera for useful discussions on integral equation numerical techniques .",
    "this work was supported by epsrc grants gr / s77240 and gr / s77103 computational resources were provided by the centre for scientific computing , university of warwick and manchester computing , university of manchester .",
    "consider a system with a property @xmath185 .",
    "the probability of finding the system with a particular @xmath186 is given by a probability distribution @xmath187 .",
    "in many cases this distribution is peaked around certain values of @xmath185 , meaning that in a standard simulation values away from these are likely to be poorly sampled .",
    "when it is desirable to get information about these unlikely states it is common to apply a weight function , @xmath188 , that changes the standard metropolis acceptance criteria to @xmath189.\\ ] ] the simulated probability distribution @xmath190 then becomes @xmath191 ideally the effect of the weight function is to make the simulation probability distribution flat , i.e. @xmath192 , which implies @xmath193 of course the @xmath194 needed to achieve this perfectly flat histogram is not known in advance , otherwise the probability distribution would also be known in advance , thus rendering the actual act of performing the simulation somewhat redundant .",
    "the problem has then become one of determining the weight function needed to produce a flat histogram .    at the start of the simulation the weight function is initially set to be constant , i.e. @xmath195 .",
    "after each attempted mc move @xmath196 ( made using the modified criteria eq .",
    "[ eqn : wl1 ] ) the weight function for the resulting state @xmath197 ( either @xmath198 or @xmath199 ) is multiplied by a modification factor , @xmath200 simultaneously the probability histogram @xmath201 is also incremented .",
    "this continues with the weight function and probability being updated after every attempted change in @xmath185 until probability histogram is flat .",
    "the flatness condition may be defined in several ways and will be discussed momentarily . once this condition has been reached the probability histogram is reset to zero and @xmath136 is modified .",
    "typically @xmath202 this then continues until the modification factor becomes close to 1 ( @xmath203 gets close to machine precision ) .",
    "the final @xmath187 may then be determined from @xmath204    a few general notes on the method are due .",
    "first updating the weight function during the simulation may be seen to violate the principle of detailed balance . however , this is most severe at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "as @xmath136 tends toward 1 , the changes in the weight function become increasingly small .",
    "it has been shown that a viable mc scheme need only asymptotically obey detailed balance @xcite .",
    "additionally once a sufficiently good weight function has been determined , the simulation may be continued without updating the weight function and statistics may be gathered from this @xcite .",
    "secondly as a perfectly flat histogram is unlikely to be reached during a finite simulation the flatness condition may be seen to be somewhat arbitrary . in the first implementations",
    "the histogram was declared flat when the smallest @xmath190 was within a given percentage of the average .",
    "however it is not impossible to imagine pathological distribution ( e.g.   with a few large narrow peaks ) that are far from flat but still fulfil this criteria .",
    "an alternative is to update @xmath136 whenever every bin has been visited a minimum number of times . while this may appear less rigorous then the first method ,",
    "as the simulation progresses and @xmath194 becomes closer to @xmath205 then @xmath190 should become flat .",
    "additionally this ensures that @xmath190 has a chance to adjust to the new @xmath136 and avoids any spurious early updates .",
    "one final point is that the wang - landau method was originally formulated for systems with discrete degrees of freedom ( specifically the ising model ) .",
    "when @xmath185 is continuous the probability histogram and weight functions are calculated for bins of finite width @xmath206 and bin width may become a perturbing factor in the results .    in the present problem",
    "we are interested in the probability distribution of a pair of non - interacting particles .",
    "the variable of interest is the radial separation of these particles @xmath67 , which is discretized into bins of width @xmath207 . as mentioned before the @xmath67 range is divided into a set of overlapping windows .",
    "a wang - landau simulation is used to determine the weight function to produce a constant @xmath208 within each window .",
    "@xmath136 is updated whenever @xmath208 fulfils two criteria : i ) the largest difference between any bin and the average is less than 10% and ii ) the smallest values of any bin is 100 ."
