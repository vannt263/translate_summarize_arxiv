    "there are also a number of theoretical results as well as numerical evidence against the existence of black holes with scalar field hair ( with various couplings to the ricci scalar curvature ) in asymptotically flat spacetime ( see , for example , @xcite for a recent discussion ) .    in an unexpected development",

    "we find that the spherically symmetric solutions admit a nontrivial regular limit , representing gravitating scalar solitons .",
    "these configurations are indexed by the central value of the scalar field and are found to be stable against linear fluctuations .",

    "these assumptions imply that @xmath45 and @xmath46 and also impose some constraints on the scalar potential ( for example , in @xmath47 , the potential should satisfy as @xmath48 the condition @xmath49 ) . in the above relations @xmath50 and @xmath51 are real constants which fix the values of the other coefficients in the asymptotic expansion . in the simplest case of a vanishing self - interaction potential",

    "as analytic solutions to the coupled nonlinear equations ( [ eqs ] ) appear to be intractable for every dimension , except for the @xmath70 black hole solution found in @xcite , the resulting system has to be solved numerically .    in this section we discuss mainly the case of a conformally coupled scalar field without a self - interaction potential . since for @xmath71 the field equations",

    "we follow the usual approach and , by using a standard ordinary differential equation solver , we evaluate the initial conditions at @xmath79 for global tolerance @xmath80 , and integrate towards @xmath81 . in this way we find that nontrivial solutions may exist in any dimension @xmath82 ( both black hole and regular solutions exist also in three spacetime dimensions ; however , their properties are somewhat special and we do not discuss them here ) .",
    "black hole solutions seem to exist for any values of the parameters @xmath83 satisfying @xmath84 .",

    "the properties of the configurations can be summarized as follows :    1 .   for @xmath1 ,",
    "aads solutions exist for any values of @xmath73 in the interval @xmath86 ; 2 .",
    "the scalar field interpolates monotonically between @xmath73 and zero and has no nodes ; 3 .",

    "as seen in figure 4 , for regular solutions @xmath51 approaches a finite value in the same limit . in the black hole case ,",
    "the critical value of @xmath51 increases very rapidly with @xmath89 , which makes its accurate determination a difficult task for large @xmath89 . in the @xmath25 case ,",

    "however , we have restricted our analysis to the particular form @xmath94 , which for @xmath47 corresponds to the case considered in @xcite .",
    "these solutions share many properties with the zero - potential case , being also indexed by the initial value of the scalar field @xmath73 .",
    "the shape of the solutions is similar to the @xmath95 case and we again found no nodes in the scalar function . in figure 1",
    "we plotted a typical @xmath47 regular solution with @xmath96 .",
    "similar solutions exist also in the black hole case . in this context",
    ", we have found that the black hole solution found in @xcite corresponds to a @xmath70 configuration with a particular choice of @xmath97 .",
    "as expected , the mass @xmath51 of the solutions increases with @xmath98 while the maximal value of @xmath73 decreases .",
    "we will not address here the question of the limiting solution for @xmath99 , which seems to be an involved problem and a different metric parametrization appears to be necessary .",
    "our preliminary results indicate that for @xmath99 the metric function @xmath100 remains finite in this limit , while the value of @xmath51 diverges .",
    "following the standard method , we consider spherically symmetric , linear perturbations of our equilibrium solutions , keeping the metric ansatz as in ( [ metric ] ) , but now the functions @xmath29 , @xmath63 and @xmath2 depend on @xmath101 as well as @xmath33 .",
    "the algebra is simplest if we work in the transformed frame ( see section 2.3 ) , where we have a minimally coupled scalar field , and , once the perturbation equations have been derived , transform back to the frame with a conformally coupled scalar field .",
    "the metric perturbations can be eliminated to yield a single perturbation equation for @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the perturbation in the conformally coupled scalar field . for periodic perturbations ( @xmath104 , etc ) ,",
    "the perturbation equation takes the standard schrdinger form @xmath105 where we have defined the `` tortoise '' co - ordinate @xmath106 by @xmath107 for regular solutions , @xmath106 has values in a finite interval @xmath108 $ ] for some @xmath109 , while for black holes , @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "the perturbation potential @xmath111 is given as follows ( we write the formula explicitly only for the vanishing self - interaction potential case , for simplicity ) : @xmath112 + \\frac { 4\\lambda \\xi _ { c } n \\phi   \\phi ' r^{3}}{{\\cal { a}}\\omega } \\right .   \\nonumber   \\\\ & &   \\left .",

    "as is often the case for aads solutions , care is needed in the use of boundary conditions to ensure that there is a self - adjoint operator in the perturbation equation ( [ perteq ] ) ( see , for example , the discussion in @xcite for the einstein - yang - mills case ) .",
    "we consider black hole and soliton solutions separately in this regard .",
    "firstly , for black hole solutions , it is convenient to change the independent variable to @xmath115 so that @xmath116 . in order to have a self - adjoint operator , we need to impose the boundary condition @xmath117 at @xmath118 , which corresponds to @xmath119 . secondly , for the regular soliton solutions ,",
    "boundary conditions need to be imposed at both @xmath120 and @xmath121 as we are working on a finite interval .",
    "suitable boundary conditions are @xmath122 at both the end - points , namely at the origin and at infinity . in both these cases , it is straightforward to check that these boundary conditions are sufficient to enable a self - adjoint operator to be constructed from the differential operator in ( [ perteq ] ) using the standard techniques , found , for example , in section xiii:2 of @xcite .",
    "some typical perturbation potentials ( [ pertpot ] ) are shown in figures 710 .",
    "we find a complicated behaviour of the perturbation potential depending on the values of the parameters @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 and the number of space - time dimensions .",
    "as @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 so for @xmath128 the potential diverges to infinity , like a standard central well potential with angular momentum ( see figure 8) .",
    "the potential @xmath111 can also be seen to vanish at the black hole event horizon ( provided @xmath129 and @xmath130 there ) , and , at infinity , the leading order behaviour is @xmath131 so for @xmath128 the potential again diverges to infinity ( see figures 8 and 10 )",
    ". turning on the self - interaction potential @xmath132 tends to increase the perturbation potential ( figure 7 ) , as also observed in @xcite .    in a limited number of cases",
    "we find that the perturbation potential ( [ pertpot ] ) is positive everywhere ( see , for example , some of the plots in figure 10 ) . in these cases",
    ", we can immediately conclude that the corresponding solutions are ( linearly ) stable , since we have a self - adjoint operator in ( [ perteq ] ) .",
    "however , for the majority of the solutions examined , the potential is not positive everywhere , and in these cases we examine the _ zero mode _ solution of the perturbation equation ( [ perteq ] ) , namely the time - independent solution when @xmath133 ( see @xcite for further details of the zero mode method applied to scalar field perturbations ) .",
    "for all the solutions we examined , the zero modes have no nodes ( zeros ) . as the operator in ( [ perteq ] ) is self - adjoint",
    ", we can apply standard theorems ( see , for example , section xiii:7 of @xcite , or @xcite ) , which state that the number of nodes of the zero mode equals the number of eigenvalues @xmath134 of ( [ perteq ] ) which are less than zero .",
    "therefore there are no eigenmodes which grow exponentially in time and the solutions are linearly stable .",
    "our conclusion that our numerical solutions are stable is in accord with previous work @xcite , in which solutions with a scalar field having no zeros were linearly stable .",
    "we can also study the stability of the exact , closed form solutions on pure ads space , given by ( [ exact - solutions ] ) . in this case",
    "we keep the background ads metric fixed and perturb simply the scalar field .",
    "the equation for the `` tortoise '' co - ordinate @xmath106 ( [ tortoise ] ) can be explicitly integrated to give @xmath135 , where @xmath136 $ ] , and the perturbation equation takes the form ( [ perteq ] ) , for periodic perturbations , with @xmath106 replaced by @xmath137 , and the perturbation potential is now @xmath138 where @xmath139 for the first type of solutions , and @xmath140 for the second type of solutions .",
    "since the perturbation potential is so simple in this case , we use an analytic , variational , method to study the stability .",
    "we define a functional @xmath141 & = & \\int _ { x=0}^{\\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\left [   -\\psi \\frac { d^{2}\\psi } { dx^{2 } } + { \\cal { v } } \\psi ^{2 } \\right ] \\ , dx \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left [ - \\psi \\frac { d\\psi } { dx } \\right ] _ { x=0}^{\\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } + \\int _ { x=0}^{\\frac { \\pi } { 2 } } \\left [ \\left ( \\frac { d\\psi } { dx } \\right ) ^{2 } + { \\cal { v } } \\psi ^{2 } \\right ] \\ , dx , \\label{variation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the second line we have integrated by parts .",
    "if we can find a test function @xmath142 such that @xmath143 is finite , the boundary term in ( [ variation ] ) vanishes and @xmath144<0 $ ] , then there must be at least one bound state solution of the perturbation equation ( [ perteq ] ) with @xmath145 , rendering the solutions unstable .",
    "using @xmath146 as our test function , the integral ( [ integral ] ) is finite , the required boundary term does indeed vanish , and @xmath147 = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{l } \\frac { 1}{16 } \\left [ -13 n^{2 } + 56 n - 44 \\right ]   ; \\\\",
    "\\frac { 1}{16 } \\left [ -13 n^{2 } + 52 n - 48 \\right ]   ; \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] for the first and second type of exact solutions , respectively .",
    "both the quadratics above are negative for all @xmath148 , so our exact , closed form solutions are unstable .",
    "this instability is perhaps a little surprising given the stability of the numerical solutions , however this may be understood as a result of the particular form of the ( negative ) scalar field potential .",
    "if we perturb the scalar field slightly , there is no nearby solution of the form ( [ exact - solutions ] ) for it to become .",
    "the nearest numerical solution will require a finite change in the scalar field at some value of @xmath33 , and this shows up as a linear instability .",
    "however , it might be reasonable to expect that the scalar field would settle on a stable , non - trivial solution rather than radiating away to infinity .",
    "in this paper we have studied the einstein - scalar system in various space - time dimensions , with a conformally coupled scalar field and a negative cosmological constant .",
    "we find both regular and black hole solutions , generalizing the black hole solutions of @xcite .",
    "both types of solutions are shown to be linearly stable , apart from some exact , discrete , closed - form solutions on pure ads , which are linearly unstable . as with previous solutions",
    "@xcite , this stability can be readily understood in terms of the breitenlohner - freedman bound @xcite , which , in @xmath149 dimensions , states that scalar fields in pure ads are stable if their mass - squared satisfies the inequality @xcite @xmath150 noting that @xmath151 so the bound is for negative mass - squared . in our case , with zero self - interaction potential ,",
    "the `` effective '' mass is given by @xmath152 for all @xmath153 , it is the case that @xmath154 , implying the stability of our solutions .",
    "there are various interesting applications of these solutions .",
    "the soliton solutions may be of interest in the gravitational collapse of scalar fields in aads .",
    "critical collapse of a conformally coupled scalar field has been studied in flat space @xcite , but not , to date at least , in 3 + 1 dimensions in aads .",
    "soliton solutions of the type found in this paper do not occur in flat space , so their presence in aads may change the phenomenology of gravitational collapse , since there are no longer just the end - point possibilities of empty space or a black hole .",
    "however , since the solitons we have found here are stable , they can not be the critical solutions , unlike the situation for einstein - yang - mills solitons in asymptotically flat space @xcite .",
    "it would also be of interest to calculate the mass and action of these solutions , and to look for possible applications within the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the thermodynamics of black holes with a conformally coupled scalar field with a positive or zero cosmological constant has already yielded some surprises ( see , for example , @xcite for a review ) , prompting a detailed study of the thermodynamics when the cosmological constant is negative .    finally , it would be interesting to extend the results derived in @xcite within the isolated horizon formalism , to the more general case considered in this work .",
