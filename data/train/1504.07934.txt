    "<S> _ summary and outlook._in conclusion , we have shown that a long - range interaction with competing attractive and repulsive parts can result in a new mechanism to form a complete devil s staircase . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we have considered the case of attractive nn interactions which lead to a dimer staircase without manifest particle - hole symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests an interesting way to control the structure of the hole sector of the staircase by tailoring the repulsive tail . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one will obtain a trimer - hole staircase through replacing the longer ranged interaction part from the vdw shape ( @xmath108 ) to a dipolar interaction potential ( @xmath109 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since in the outlined double rydberg dressing scheme the range of the attractive branch of the potential can be tuned freely , and therefore be extended over more lattice spacings , we expect that more exotic polymer staircases can be explored .    _ </S>",
