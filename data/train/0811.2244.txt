    "it is believed that in the strong coupling limit , many horizonless three - charge brane configurations undergo a geometric transition and become smooth horizonless geometries with black hole or black ring charges @xcite .",
    "these charges come completely from fluxes wrapping on non - trivial cycles .",
    "the three - charge black hole ( ring ) systems are dual to the states of corresponding conformal field theories : in favor of the idea that non - fundamental - black hole ( ring ) systems effectively arise as a result of many horizonless configurations @xcite .",
    "the simplest eleven - dimensional supergravity metrics ( the low - energy limit of m - theory @xcite ) with three - charge geometries have the form @xcite@xmath1where @xmath2 are coordinates of compactification six - torus and @xmath3 is any hyper - khler metric ( which is equivalent to a metric with self - dual curvature in four dimensions ) .",
    "to preserve supersymmetry , the base metric @xmath3 should be hyper - khler @xcite .",
    "the five - dimensional space - time sub - metric of ( [ 11d ] ) together with maxwell field make the bosonic sector of five - dimensional minimal supergravity . in five - dimensions , unlike the four dimensions that the only horizon topology is 2-sphere , we can have different more interesting horizon topologies such as black holes with horizon topology of 3-sphere @xcite , black rings with horizon topology of 2-sphere @xmath4 circle @xcite , black saturn : a spherical black hole  surrounded by a black ring @xcite , black lens which the horizon geometry is a lens space @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "all allowed horizon topologies have been classified in @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown how a uniqueness theorem might be proved for black holes in five dimensions @xcite .",
    "it was shown stationary , asymptotically flat vacuum black holes with two commuting axial symmetries are uniquely determined by their mass , angular momentum and rod structure .",

    "the authors have used hyper - khler atiyah - hitchin base space and its ambi - polar generalizations to construct five - dimensional , three - charge supergravity solutions that only have a rotational @xmath0 isometry .",
    "the complete solutions are regular around the critical surface of ambi - polar base space .",
    "these solutions are very remarkable because ( ambi - polar ) hyper - khler atiyah - hitchin geometries ( unlike ambi - polar gibbons - hawking geometries ) do nt have any tri - holomorphic @xmath0 isometry ( tri - holomorphic @xmath0 isometry means the @xmath0 preserves all three complex structures of the hyper - khler geometry ) .",
    "hence they could be used to study the interesting physical processes such as , merger of two breckenridge - myers - peet - vafa black holes @xcite or the geometric transition of a three - charge supertube of arbitrary shape ; that do nt respect any tri - holomophic @xmath0 symmetry . in @xcite ,",

    "these solutions were constructed by placing m2- and m5-branes in the bianchi type ix background geometry .",
    "the special feature of this constructions  is that the solutions are not restricted to be in the near core region of the d6 ( d5 or d4)-brane .",
    "moreover , all of the different solutions preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry as a result of the self - duality of the bianchi type ix metric .",

    "the twistor spaces are two - sphere bundles over bianchi type ix einstein metrics with self - dual weyl tensor .    in this paper , we use self - dual bianchi type ix space as the base space to construct some new five - dimensional supergravity solutions with generic non - tri - holomorphic @xmath0 isometries .",
    "we would like to stress that , in general , constructing solutions with non - tri - holomorphic @xmath0 isometries is a rather complicated , tedious and challenging task . to our knowledge , for classical black holes and black rings , only two solutions exist @xcite .",

    "we conclude with a few comments about possible directions for future work .",
    "we have shown that our new solution ( based on tri axial bianchi type ix space ) is asymptotically free of any closed time - like curves .",
    "an interesting application of our solutions is to seek for their holographic dual theories . in the case of existence of boundary holographic dual theories to the solutions ( or their generalization with cosmological constant ) , then they would be free of any irregularities associated with the closed time - like curves in the bulk of space - time . moreover , in deriving our solutions , we have considered the simplest dependence of the five dimensional metric function on the coordinates ( i.e. dependence only to the radial coordinate ) .",
    "the reason for taking the simplest dependence is due to the non - homogeneity of differential equation ( [ eqforf ] ) for the metric function , otherwise finding the solutions could be very hard or even impossible . if we want to find some other solutions ( with metric function depending on two or more coordinates ) , then we should consider the homogenous differential equation ( ( [ eqforf ] ) with @xmath120 equal to zero ) .",
    "it s quite possible that in solutions to the homogenous differential equation , the point @xmath153 can be converted to a regular hypersurface(s ) in five dimensional space - time and we obtain black hole solutions .",
