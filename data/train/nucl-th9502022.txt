    "in this paper we concentrate on the few - body interactions of @xmath0 mesons . these could complement our knowledge on the @xmath0-nucleon interaction and tell us possible evidence of @xmath0-nuclear quasibound states .",
    "such quasibound states were predicted by haider and liu @xcite and detailed calculations performed by li et al .",
    "@xcite , when it turned out that the @xmath0-nucleon interaction was attractive . to be observable",
    "these states should be narrow enough , and this is not likely to happen for the lowest @xmath0 states in large nuclei .",
    "on the other hand it was suggested by wilkin @xcite that the rapid slope seen in the @xmath4he amplitude of ref .",
    "@xcite just above the threshold may signal that a quasibound state is generated already for small nuclei(@xmath5 ) .",
    "in contrast , a recent study of the @xmath6he reaction shows no structure due to any final state @xmath7he interaction @xcite .",
    "all this could indicate a large @xmath8he scattering length and a small one for @xmath7he .",
    "however , quite an opposite interpretation is put forward in this paper .",
    "we calculate the @xmath8he and @xmath7he scattering lengths and find that the former is _ smaller _ than the latter , and that they also differ in the sign of the real part .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath0-nucleus attraction is not strong enough to give any binding effect in the @xmath8he system , but it is likely to give one in the @xmath7he system .    in the standard theory of final state interactions the energy dependence of reactions",
    "is assumed to be determined by the scattering amplitude between the final state particles @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that the shape of the low energy @xmath0 production cross section is also significantly influenced by an interference of the free and the scattered waves in the final @xmath0-helium states , because the corresponding scattering lengths are not very large .",
    "this interference is such that the decrease with energy becomes steeper for both @xmath9he and @xmath10he than that calculated from the final state scattering amplitude alone .",
    "however , in the scattering amplitude itself the real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude , due to the above mentioned difference in the sign of the real parts , could be expected to conspire so that the slope in the @xmath10he case would be somewhat smaller than for @xmath9he .",
    "numerical results do not support this for @xmath11 scattering lengths considered realistic .    before this physical interpretation of final state interactions",
    "is discussed in section [ sec3 ] , a formalism is developed in section [ sec2 ] to calculate the @xmath0-helium scattering lengths . by some formal manipulations the multiple scattering series is summed .",
    "the procedure used is shown to converge quickly in the case of @xmath0he optical potentials , which may be solved exactly using the schrdinger equation .",
    "then , necessary corrections to the optical potential limit may be easily implemented by modifying the equivalent multiple scattering series .",
    "the conclusions are not fully quantified since the @xmath0-nucleon input is not determined uniquely .",
    "also the @xmath0 production mechanism is not under full control . here",
    "a method for calculating only the final state interaction is given .",
    "however , this method is presented in sufficient detail that a more complete comparison with the data and the determination of the input uncertainties can be made when measurements proposed at proton storage rings , such as the one at celsius , are performed . comparing specifically with the @xmath12he data we also perform an extensive variation of the @xmath11 scattering length in search for a constraint on it , complementing elementary photo- or electroproduction .",
    "the @xmath0-helium scattering lengths are calculated in this section . at",
    "first we consider the simplest optical model expressed in terms of the @xmath0-nucleon scattering length .",
    "this problem may be solved numerically , but in order to improve the method an equivalent alternative for the optical model is provided , which consists of a partial summation of the multiple scattering series generated by the optical potential . the sum is expressed in terms of multiple integrals .    next , some necessary improvements to the optical model are introduced into the partial sum .",
    "these are essentially twofold : ( i ) removing multiple collisions on the same nucleon and , ( ii ) introducing an off - shell @xmath0-nucleon scattering matrix . other effects , e.g. the pauli principle , are less significant .",
    "these improvements introduce massive changes to the @xmath0-helium scattering lengths defined here as the zero energy limit of the effective range expansion @xmath13 in particular , for the @xmath8he system , the simplest optical model yields a large negative real part of the scattering length indicating the existence of a quasibound state",
    ". however , when the corrections are included , a sizable positive scattering length emerges . on the other hand , in the @xmath7he system we do find indications for a quasibound state close to threshold .      in ref .",
    "@xcite a multiple scattering scheme was proposed to calculate the energy shifts and widths in the atomic states of antiprotons interacting with a light nucleus . in this paper",
    "we apply the same method to @xmath0he scattering at threshold .",
    "first the procedure is presented in some detail , since it is important to understand to what extent the basic form of the multiple scattering scheme is , in this case , numerically equivalent to the standard optical model approximation .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath14 for an @xmath0 meson interacting with a nucleus of @xmath15 nucleons may be expressed as a series in the following way by first considering the scattering from two non - overlapping fixed centres . in that limit",
    "it can be shown that the scattering matrix at zero energy has the _ exact _ form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the propagator of the scattered particle  with @xmath18 being the distance apart of the two scattering centres  and the @xmath19 are the scattering matrices from the separate centres .",
    "this expression has the following feature that is important in few body systems . by expanding the denominator ,",
    "a multiple scattering series emerges which  through the factor of 1/2 in the denominator  automatically takes into account the exclusion of successive scatterings from the same centre .",
    "being guided by this and denoting @xmath20 , one might then naively expect the analogous expression for the scattering from @xmath15 non - fixed centres to have a form @xmath21^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 with @xmath23 the zero - energy propagator for a free @xmath0 . here",
    "the factor @xmath24 is the generalisation of the exclusion factor 1/2 in eq .",
    "( [ wal ] ) and @xmath25 is the reduced mass of the @xmath26 system .",
    "however , as it now stands eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) can not be correct beyond @xmath27 , since it does not give the required form @xmath28 @xmath29 when expanded in powers of @xmath30 . one way of ensuring that this correct expansion results is to modify eq .",

    "( [ series1 ] ) the term of @xmath27 is @xmath34 , which in eq .",
    "( [ mss ] ) should give @xmath35 . since @xmath36 has already been fixed by the second term in eq .",
    "( [ mss ] ) , we get @xmath37 .",
    "this is a unique procedure and , neglecting for the moment the above exclusion of consecutive scatterings on the same nucleon , it leads to the expressions @xmath38 @xmath39 for the first three terms of the series in the denominator . also in @xmath40 it is immediately seen that the integers multiplying each term cancel each other e.g. in @xmath41 we see + 1 and 1 , in @xmath42 we see 1,+2,1 etc . in the fixed centre limit all of the integrals",
    "reduce to the same value , so that @xmath43 are then all zero as found in ref .",
    "the important point is that numerically this cancellation continues to a great extent even away from the fixed centre limit as seen below .",
    "therefore , one could hope that the introduction of the ratios @xmath44 etc . of double and triple scatterings and other `` disconnected '' terms at various places",
    "would speed up the convergence of the multiple scattering series .",
    "here now @xmath30 denotes a scattering matrix of the @xmath0 from @xmath15 nucleons in the impulse approximation . at `` zero ''",

    "the expectation values appearing in eqs .",

    "the number 0.7796 in @xmath42 is the result of a double summation and is expected to have an accuracy of @xmath58 .",
    "when , the terms of the series in the denominator are clustered into increasing powers of @xmath48 as indicated in eqs .",
    "( [ series1],[r ] ) , it is found that there exists a considerable amount of cancellation , e.g. @xmath59 , @xmath60=0.045 and @xmath61=0.0076 where @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath63 is reasonably small  as it is in the present case of @xmath11 scattering  the series appears to converge rapidly .",
    "a check on the convergence is given in table [ tabopt ] , where a comparison is made between the above series expansion for @xmath14 and its value calculated directly from the equivalent optical model potential @xmath64 in this comparison the factors @xmath24 in eq .

    "is taken to be minus the @xmath11 scattering length , i.e. @xmath67 . the actual numbers used are a representative sample from the following sources .",
    "several groups have performed coupled channel analyses of @xmath0-nucleon and @xmath68-nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "these differ in the input data and also in some details of the extraction of the @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath11 scattering lengths obtained are : 0.27+i0.22 and 0.28+i0.19 @xcite and @xmath70 fm @xcite .",

    "the multiple scattering effect is dramatic as compared with the impulse approximation alone , changing the attractive real part of the @xmath11 amplitude into a repulsive real part for the @xmath26 amplitude .",
    "however , the near equality between @xmath46 and @xmath71 gives confidence that , indeed , the series in eq .",
    "( [ series1 ] ) is rapidly convergent and the use of only the terms @xmath72 and @xmath42 gives a sufficient accuracy .",
    "having shown in some detail that , indeed , the standard optical model approach can be replaced by the multiple scattering series of eq .",
    "( [ series1 ] ) , it now seems justified to modify the latter to include effects not so easily incorporated directly into the optical model .",
    "several improvements can be made to the optical model approach and these can be implemented into the partial sum of eq .",

    "\\i ) firstly , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ mss ] ) the factors @xmath73 in the rescattering quantities @xmath74 and @xmath42 calculated in eqs .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) should be replaced by @xmath75 to prevent the @xmath0 from interacting successively with the same nucleon , i.e. @xmath76 . in table",
    "[ tabam1 ] this effect is demonstrated for the @xmath11 scattering lengths used in table [ tabopt ] , and it is seen to have a large effect in all cases . in particular , this correction makes the real parts of the scattering lengths small for @xmath9he making the existence of a quasibound state in the @xmath12he system indicated by the optical model questionable .",
    "the absence of such a state seems to be further confirmed by later corrections for @xmath9he .",
    "however , the real parts tend to become even more negative in the case of @xmath10he .",
    "\\ii ) another improvement to the above series is to use an @xmath11 scattering amplitude that is more appropriate for scattering on a bound nucleon in a medium .",
    "this can be approximately taken into account by extrapolating @xmath69 off the energy shell through replacing the above scattering amplitude @xmath77 at zero energy by @xmath78 at a negative energy defined via the equation @xmath79 where @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the @xmath82 separation energy and the recoil energy of the @xmath11 pair relative to the residual nucleus . for @xmath9he [ @xmath10he",
    "] these quantities have the values @xmath83 $ ] mev and @xmath84 $ ] mev .",
    "the effects are shown in table [ taboff ] .",
    "there it is seen that our best estimate @xmath85 of the @xmath26 scattering length is quite different from that predicted by the optical model .",
    "for example in @xmath8he scattering , the negative re@xmath86(opt ) has turned positive and comparable to that of the original impulse approximation .",
    "this indicates that there is no binding in this system .",
    "however , for @xmath7he the negative sign of re@xmath86(opt ) is maintained suggesting a quasibound state . at the end of this section",
    "these effects are interpreted in terms of poles in the scattering matrix .",
    "one should note in this context that , since in eq .",
    "( [ off ] ) a significant non - zero value is assigned for the @xmath0 momentum , the next term in the effective range expansion ( [ efran ] ) could become important , if @xmath87 is large .",
    "this could have now the effect of changing the energy variation present in eq .",
    "( [ off ] ) .",
    "\\iii ) the major mechanism that generates the imaginary part of @xmath46 is the reaction @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the nucleon resonance @xmath90 with a strong coupling both to the @xmath0 and the pion .",
    "therefore , for @xmath0 scattering on deuterium or @xmath10he  both isoscalars  the final nucleus @xmath91 can not be an isoscalar .",
    "because the spin is not involved in this @xmath92-wave scattering , then for example with the deuteron the final @xmath93 state must be the @xmath94 state and also the transition operator must be spatially antisymmetric .",
    "this opens up the interesting possibility that pionic inelastic channels are damped in these cases leading to a reduction of the in - medium value of im@xmath95 .",
    "however , as shown in the appendix this turns out to be only a very small effect and so this correction is not included in the present calculations .",
    "if there exists a pole in the scattering matrix close to the threshold , the scattering lengths may become larger than the nuclear radius . to some extent",
    "this situation is met here , in particular in @xmath10he . in the case of a bound state re@xmath96 , while a virtual state corresponds to re@xmath97 .",
    "the connection is unique provided the effective range is small , which is assumed here .",
    "however , the validity of this assumption is not clear .",
    "another complication arises because of the presence of decay channels described here by im@xmath95 .",
    "even though there is no detailed many channel structure of the scattering matrix , let us , however , look for the poles given by the condition @xmath98= 0 .",
    "with our best values @xmath85 we have a pole in the upper complex momentum half plane , i.e. a quasibound state in the @xmath7he case .",
    "this situation is , in fact , typical for all re@xmath95 in the range 0.3 to 0.6 fm or even higher . on the other hand , with positive re@xmath99",
    "one meets a virtual state in @xmath12he systems .",
    "since there are no beams of @xmath0-mesons , the interactions of these mesons may be seen only via final state interactions or via the decay mechanisms of quasibound states . as seen in fig .",
    "1 , the @xmath100he production amplitude displays a rapid fall - off away from the threshold region , which led wilkin to conjecture that an @xmath12he quasibound or resonance state exists nearby @xcite .",
    "this is reflected by the approximate proportionality of the cross section to the final state interaction factor @xcite latexmath:[\\[\\label{cwf }    @xmath46 is the @xmath0-helium scattering length and @xmath102 is the @xmath0 momentum .",
    "it was found by wilkin in the optical potential approach @xcite , recalculated here in section [ sec2 ] , that im@xmath103 is rather large , which gives the required slope and indicates a singularity .",
    "however , surprisingly the recent data on the reaction @xmath104he indicate no such slope in the cross section close to the threshold @xcite .",
    "we now analyse these two measurements below .    first , let us note that eq .",
    "( [ cwf ] ) provides a good description only , if @xmath105  a condition not well satisfied here by the @xmath106 for @xmath9he .",
    "a more general model needs the final @xmath92-state wave function for the @xmath0-he system @xmath107 .",

    "since the factor @xmath113 $ ] determines the behaviour of the scattered wave inside the range of the interaction , it can be interpreted as producing an off - shell effect into the reaction",
    ". a plausible choice of @xmath114 is taken  but , as shown below , the shape of the cross section is rather insensitive to the actual value of @xmath115 .    in the reaction process",
    "the @xmath0 s are produced with some amplitude @xmath116 that depends both on the initial projectile momentum @xmath117 and on the spatial extent of the process . for @xmath0 energies in the range of",
    "05 mev the dependence on @xmath118 ( @xmath1191 gev ) is presumably small .",
    "so far there is no complete understanding of the actual production mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , for the present purposes it is sufficient to make only some rather general qualitative statements concerning this mechanism . here",
    "we simply assume a proportionality of the production amplitude to the nuclear density used to derive eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 being a natural choice . in this way",
    ", the final state interaction factor becomes @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "however , in practice the @xmath115 dependence is weak with even @xmath125 being not unreasonable .",
    "as said above , we typically fix @xmath115 at @xmath126 leaving only the @xmath127 dependence . lacking an actual model for @xmath0 production , in all cases the results are normalised to give the experimental value of the spin - averaged quantity @xmath128 at @xmath129 .",
    "the original hope had been that , with @xmath127 around unity , a good fit would be obtained to the shape of the experimental data . however , this was only so for potential iv .",
    "in that case , with @xmath127=0.88 and @xmath114 there was a very shallow minimum in the @xmath130 fit to @xmath131 .",
    "it should be added that this fit did not include the lowest experimental point at @xmath132 , since this is thought to be subject to large systematic errors due to beam width effects , including energy losses in the target @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tabfin ] and fig . 1 .",
    "this table illustrates the following points : + 1 ) as seen from columns 3 and 4 the dependence on @xmath133 is weak .",
    "both @xmath134 and @xmath135 yield good fits to the data , since fixing @xmath134 gives @xmath130/data point = 0.35 , which is increased to only 1.02 for @xmath125 .",

    "+ 3 ) the normalisation factors needed to fit the experimental value of 0.63 @xmath137b / sr at @xmath138 are 0.87 , 0.31 , 1.50 for columns 3 , 4 , 5 , respectively .",
    "this shows that @xmath139 is 1.7 times stronger than @xmath136 and so could account for a significant part of the factor of 2.5 by which the model of ref .",
    "@xcite underestimated the experimental data .",
    "it should be added that there is a strong correlation between @xmath127 and @xmath115 , e.g. for @xmath140 the minimum @xmath130/dp is still 0.35 but with @xmath127=0.97 .",
    "the dependence on the parameter @xmath127 is also weak as it is with @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the main dependence may be expected to arise from the input values of the elementary @xmath11 scattering amplitude .",

    "the corresponding results with potential iv for @xmath10he are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that @xmath136 from eq .",
    "( [ cwf ] ) gives a visually better fit to the data and that @xmath144 appears to produce too much energy dependence .",
    "however , it should be noted that here the experimental data have large error bars and exist only at a few energies . in the opinion of the authors ,",
    "this should not be considered a fatal problem .",
    "clearly some reduction of the experimental errors would be welcome to make these data more selective .",
    "so far the values of @xmath69 used are those suggested by experiment .",
    "however , these differ considerably amongst themselves with @xmath69=[0.30.6]+i[0.30.4]fm being a more reasonable estimate ( see caption of table [ tabopt ] ) . in view of this , it is of interest to make a global variation of the input @xmath69 to recognize the optimal regions to fit the @xmath145 cross section data within different model regimes .",

    "3 shows the results for @xmath148 in the complex @xmath69 plane . in the hatched regions this parameter is smaller than unity and",
    "other contours show the values 2,3, ... ,10 .",
    "it can be seen that there is a systematic change due to each correction introduced in this work into the optical model results  with all these additional effects being in the same direction .",
    "there may be a common area around @xmath149 fm for the optical model @xcite without a born background introduced in eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) and for the full model , but elsewhere the models are exclusive",
    ". the @xmath9he data would allow in each model a valley of minimum @xmath130 in different regions for @xmath69 .",
    "so it is clear that ( even assuming that the production mechanism were known ) these data can not uniquely determine the scattering length , although they set a strong constraint .",
    "it may be noted that similar fits could be attempted for the @xmath10he data .",
    "however , there the quoted experimental errors are so large that as such the fit would be useless .",
    "even so , the energy independence of the production amplitude indicated by the four existing data points close to the @xmath2he threshold in very suggestive .",
    "it was not possible to produce this feature with any reasonable value of the elementary scattering lengths allowed by the above considered models for @xmath9he .",
    "similar energy dependences in the @xmath10he case are also obtained by wilkin in ref .",
    "this paper is in two distinct parts . in the first , the basic @xmath0-nucleon scattering length @xmath69 is converted into effective @xmath150he scattering lengths @xmath151he ) , which , in the second part , are then used to calculate the final state interactions in the @xmath152he and @xmath153he reactions .    the step from @xmath69 to @xmath151he )",

    "both the first stage , in which the replacement @xmath154 is made , and the second stage , in which the scattering from a nucleon that is bound is taken into account , give large corrections that tend to go in the same direction .",
    "the overall effect is to give @xmath151he ) s that are very different from those expected using the pure optical model ( see tables [ tabam1 ] and [ taboff ] ) .",
    "however , it should be added that this calculation ignores the effect of the possible presence of a sizable effective range in the basic @xmath11 interaction .",
    "when the above @xmath151he ) s are used to extract the effect of final state interactions from the @xmath152he reaction , it is found that only one ( option iv ) of the @xmath69 s proposed in the caption of table [ tabopt ] is able to give a good fit to the @xmath9he data  but not the less restrictive @xmath10he data ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .    in an attempt to see if there exist other values of @xmath69 that can give a good fit to @xmath9he and , in addition , give a better fit to the @xmath10he data , a search was made in the region @xmath155 and @xmath156 . however , this did not produce any @xmath69 significantly better than the earlier option iv . if one may disregard the @xmath10he data either as too inaccurate or arising from too complex a reaction , it seems that the @xmath9he results indicate some potential for constraining the elementary @xmath11 scattering length .",

    "let @xmath158 be @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the bare mass of the @xmath89 and the @xmath161 are couplings to the different channels .",
    "the latter are functions of the channel momenta @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath157 follows from the lippman - schwinger equation @xmath164 the separability of the interaction ( [ sepb ] ) then allows for the simple solution .",
    "@xmath165 where @xmath166 the value of the total re@xmath167 yields an energy shift for the n * , while im@xmath167 determines its width . with a relativistically invariant normalisation @xmath168 for both the @xmath0 and @xmath169 in eq .",
    "( [ ls2 ] ) one obtains for the partial width into channel @xmath170 @xmath171 and the @xmath172 .",
    "the parameters of the coupling strengths and form factor ranges may be fitted to @xmath0-photoproduction ( electro - production ) and @xmath68-nucleon scattering data as well as to the @xmath89 decay properties .",
    "analyses of this sort have been performed by several groups@xcite .",
    "these differ slightly in the treatment of relativistic effects and on the ( uncertain ) input , and there is significant variation in the actual predictions for the scattering lengths @xmath69 .",
    "now , let us consider @xmath0 scattering on a correlated @xmath173 pair of nucleons forming a quasideuteron state .",
    "the intermediate states in the pionic channels have @xmath174 and so , due to the pauli principle , the intermediate nucleons must be antisymmetric in space coordinates .",
    "this may reduce the available phase space and so lead to a blocking of virtual ( or real ) @xmath175 transitions . as a consequence",
    "the effective im@xmath95 may be reduced in a nuclear medium . to allow for this effect",
    "we calculate the correction to the @xmath176 of eq .",
    "( [ ls2 ] ) due to this pauli effect .",
    "an average quantity @xmath177 is calculated with an antisymmetrised free @xmath93 propagator  the average being taken over the @xmath93 ground state .",
    "further , in this estimate a zero - range interaction is assumed between the meson and nucleons , which are considered to be fixed . in this way a correction term @xmath178 is obtained in the form @xmath179 where @xmath180 = -\\tilde{\\rho}({\\bf q}).\\ ] ] here @xmath181 is the initial @xmath93 wavefunction and @xmath182 is the fourier transform of the related density . for large systems",
    "this correction disappears , since @xmath183 .",
    "but it could be sizable , if the inverse @xmath106 of the system is comparable to the momenta involved .",
    "however , for im@xmath184 with @xmath185 one finds only a few per cent change of the @xmath89 width in the deuteron and in helium .",
    "this is so small a correction  also obtained at high momentum , where the wave functions tend to be uncertain  that it is reasonable to neglect its effect .",
