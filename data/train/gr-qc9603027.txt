    "three decades after the first exploratory steps were made @xcite canonical quantum gravity continues as a vigorous program of fundamental research .",
    "new life has been breathed into this field about a decade ago by ashtekar s discovery @xcite of a representation of general relativity in terms of new variables , which render the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints more tractable .",
    "the developments in nonperturbative canonical quantum gravity which followed this advance @xcite justify a reasonable hope that a mathematically consistent quantum gravity might be attainable . still , the program is far from completed and many facets of the theory remain to be explored .",
    "one such facet is the relation between the metric representation and ashtekar s representation .",
    "this question is far from trivial : ashtekar s formulation starts out with complexified general relativity and suitable reality conditions on the new variables have to be imposed at the end .",
    "the metric representation , on the other hand , stays within the domain of the real theory all along .",
    "thus it is not clear , a priori , whether there is a unique one to one relation between the complexified theory and the real theory .",
    "can , e.g. , a single solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation in ashtekar s variables before imposing reality conditions give rise to several mathematically and physically distinct solutions in metric variables ?    in the present paper",
    "we wish to examine this question in the framework of the minisuperspace model of diagonal bianchi type ix with a non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "kodama @xcite and brencowe @xcite have found a simple solution of the basic constraints of quantum gravity with cosmological term in ashtekar s variables in the form of an exponential of the chern - simons functional . by projecting to bianchi type ix geometries",
    "one also obtains a solution for the minisuperspace model @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we shall start from the wheeler - dewitt equation for the minisuperspace model in the metric representation and a specific choice of operator ordering ( which is gleaned from the special operator ordering appearing naturally if supergravity is used as a starting point @xcite ) .",
    "the ashtekar representation is then introduced only on the quantum level as a mathematical device , like a laplace - transform , to simplify the equations .",
    "in fact , the representation is introduced as a kind of complexified momentum - representation , in which ashtekar s variables are the complexified canonically conjugate momenta of the inverse triad corresponding to the bianchi type ix 3-metric .",
    "the integration contour in the complex manifold spanned by these momentum variables may be chosen quite freely within the requirements of convergence and the vanishing of boundary terms in partial integrations .",
    "integration contours which can be deformed into each other while satisfying these requirements are topologically equivalent .",
    "however , a given solution in ashtekar variables may admit topologically inequivalent choices of integration contours .",
    "such a solution in ashtekar variables may then correspond to several mathematically and physically distinct solutions in the metric representation .",
    "in fact , we shall show that this happens for the chern - simons topological solution in the diagonal bianchi type ix minisuperspace model .",
    "we find that five topologically inequivalent integration contours over the ashtekar variables exist , which are organized by five distinct saddle - points of the reduced chern - simons functional and the accompanying paths of steepest ascent and descent .",
    "these findings raise the interesting question , whether similar results may also be obtained in the full theory .",
    "the answer to this question is not obvious , because the enlargement of the configuration space , in principle , could render integration contours topologically equivalent , which appear as topologically inequivalent when projected on the minisuperspace under investigation .    while this general question transcends our minisuperspace framework and must be left open here , our results for the minisuperspace model yield several new exact solutions in metric variables with non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "these solutions turn out to be of interest in their own right . to simplify their discussion",
    "we restrict ourselves to the physically more interesting case @xmath0 throughout this paper and postpone the examination of the case @xmath1 to a future work .",
    "we discuss the asymptotic limits of the solutions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 and show that , at least semi - classically , two of them satisfy the cosmological boundary conditions proposed by vilenkin @xcite and by hartle and hawking @xcite , respectively . furthermore , we show that it is just the no - boundary state which additionally fulfills a physically well - motivated normalizability condition .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ 1 ] we establish our notation , put down the wheeler - dewitt equation in the adopted operator ordering , and briefly list the five exact solutions for vanishing cosmological constant which are known from recent work on bianchi type ix supergravity . in section [ 2 ] the ashtekar representation is introduced as a complexified momentum - representation , and the resulting chern - simons solution of the wheeler - dewitt operator is given . in section",
    "[ 3 ] that solution is transformed to the metric representation along five topologically distinct integration contours , which establishes a basis of five linearly independent solutions which are all generated by the chern - simons solution . their asymptotic behavior for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the scale parameter and @xmath6 the cosmological constant ) is studied in section [ 4 ] . here ,",
    "in addition , we establish the relation of two of these solutions to those picked out by the boundary or no - boundary conditions of vilenkin , and hartle and hawking , respectively . in the last section",
    "we draw some conclusions and indicate how our results may also be used to establish certain limiting forms of bianchi type ix models coupled to a scalar matter field with very small mass .",
    "the purpose of this section is to establish some notation and to derive the wheeler - dewitt equation for the bianchi type ix model in the metric representation in a specific factor - ordering .",
    "we start from the einstein - hilbert action with a cosmological constant @xmath6    @xmath7\\ = \\",

    "lapse_-function @xmath11 , a _",
    "shift_-vector @xmath12 and the 3-metric @xmath13 of the spatial slice are introduced in the usual way @xcite .",
    "then the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) takes the form",
    "@xmath14     + where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the curvature scalar of the spatial manifold , and @xmath17 is the extrinsic curvature tensor .",
    "the spatial homogeneity manifests itself in the existence of infinitesimal coordinate transformations @xmath18 , which leave tensors on the 3-manifold form - invariant @xcite . in the bianchi type ix case the algebra of the killing - vectors with @xmath19",
    "is chosen to be    @xmath20     + implying @xmath21 for the invariant basis @xmath22 @xcite . using this special basis in the following , the components of all tensors on the 3-manifold become functions of time @xmath23 only .",
    "let us now consider the bianchi type ix form @xcite    @xmath24     + for the 3-metric , but with restriction to the diagonal case .",
    "then @xmath25 is a diagonal , traceless @xmath26-matrix , which can be parameterized as    @xmath27     + the action ( [ 1.2 ] ) yields a lagrangian    @xmath28     + where the spatial integration has been carried out using @xmath29 , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 have to be expressed in terms of the new metric variables @xmath30 and their time - derivatives .",
    "it turns out , that @xmath31 is independent of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , so the conjugate momenta satisfy the primary constraints    @xmath34     + i.e. they vanish identically .",
    "the preservation of the primary constraints in time leads to the secondary constraints    @xmath35     + the first of which is the hamiltonian constraint , while the second one , in the present case , is solved by taking @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the 4-metric is now of the form    @xmath37     + a straightforward legendre transform yields the hamiltonian    @xmath38    here the momenta @xmath39 + have been introduced , which are connected to the generalized velocities as follows :    @xmath40     + furthermore , the curvature - potential @xmath41 has been defined as    @xmath42     + the hamiltonian constraint now simply reads @xmath43 .    to quantize the model , one may seek for solutions of the schrdinger equation @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is now interpreted as a self - adjoint operator over a suitably defined hilbert space of wavefunctions @xmath46 .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint , which must be satisfied by the physical states , then implies a restriction to zero - energy states , yielding the wheeler - dewitt equation    @xmath47     + the quantized version of the hamiltonian ( [ 1.9 ] ) , which is obtained from the usual rules of canonical quantization , suffers from the well - known ambiguity in the choice of the factor - ordering",
    ". we shall resolve this ambiguity in such a way that a class of simple semi - classical solutions of ( [ 1.13 ] ) ( to be given in the following section ) , whose existence and form , due to their semi - classical nature , are independent of the factor - ordering , become _ exact _ solutions .",
    "this will be achieved through the following non - standard procedure : it is easily checked that the classical hamiltonian ( [ 1.9 ] ) can be written in the form    @xmath48     + where @xmath49 is defined as    @xmath50     + assuming now canonical commutation relations @xmath51 , the momenta in the @xmath30-representation may be expressed as @xmath52 , and @xmath53 becomes    @xmath54     + finally , this corresponds to a wheeler - dewitt equation    @xmath55     + in the metric representation .",
    "the non - standard term @xmath56 is a quantum correction to the classical `` potential '' @xmath57 and appears as a result of our choice of operator ordering in equation ( [ 1.15 ] ) .      for completeness , and because they will play some role in the discussion of the general solutions in the case @xmath58",
    ", we shall now present a derivation of the five known solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ 1.16 ] ) without cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "an obvious , exact solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation with vanishing @xmath6 can be extracted from the form ( [ 1.15 ] ) immediately @xcite :    @xmath59     + in the classical limit @xmath2 one can interpret @xmath60 as the euclidean action of this wavefunction .",
    "as known from hamilton - jacobi theory the derivatives of the action with respect to the generalized coordinates play the role of the generalized momenta , so the classical trajectories may be computed via ( [ 1.11 ] ) from    @xmath61     + clearly , because @xmath62 , no real solutions to ( [ 1.18 ] ) exist , but one can introduce a new parameter of imaginary time @xmath63 and look for euclidean solutions , corresponding to positive definite 4-manifolds via ( [ 1.8 ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that the solutions of ( [ 1.18 ] ) in this euclidean regime form a two - parameter family of classical universes , which become all asymptotically flat and isotropic in the limit @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the average scale factor .",
    "in fact , ( [ 1.17 ] ) is the well - known `` wormhole - state '' of the bianchi type ix model .    to derive other solutions of the model without cosmological constant we will first subject the hamiltonian ( [ 1.15 ] ) to the similarity - transformation    @xmath66     + which yields    @xmath67     + moreover , new variables playing the role of the inverse triad are introduced    @xmath68     + where @xmath69 are the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath25 . denoting derivatives with respect to these new variables with @xmath70 and rescaling the cosmological constant into @xmath71 , one finds for the hamiltonian in the @xmath72-representation :    @xmath73     +",
    "two important features of @xmath74 in this representation should be mentioned :    * @xmath74 is a sum of three terms , producing each other by cyclic permutation of the indices .",
    "* @xmath74 is invariant under converting two of the @xmath72 into their negatives .",
    "the first of these properties suggests to look for solutions by solving the reduced equation    @xmath75     + with a @xmath72-symmetric function @xmath76 .",
    "the simplest solution to this ansatz turns out to be    @xmath77     + which by multiplication with the wormhole - state gives a second solution , the `` hartle - hawking state '' @xcite .",
    "this name can be justified by discussing the equations for the classical trajectories analogous to ( [ 1.18 ] ) . there",
    "it turns out that each member of the two - parameter family of solutions describes a regular ( and isotropic ) universe in the limit @xmath78 , i.e. _ in this sense _ @xmath79 satisfies the `` no - boundary '' proposal .    three further solutions to the wheeler - dewitt equation",
    "occur just because of the second property of the @xmath72-representation of @xmath74 , namely @xcite    @xmath80     + these `` asymmetric solutions '' create classical universes which turn out to be asymptotically three dimensional : in the limit @xmath64 the @xmath81-th dimension is curved to zero , while the remaining manifold becomes an asymtotically flat , spatially two dimensional wormhole .",
    "we shall add a few remarks on these states concerning their _",
    "normalizability_. an investigation of the five wavefunctions reveals that @xmath82 and the three asymmetric solutions @xmath83 are _ bounded _ functions on minisuperspace , whereas @xmath84 is unbounded ( in fact , it grows super - exponentially for @xmath85 , when @xmath86 is kept fixed and small ) . in the limit @xmath87 , i.e. considering vanishing scale factors , all five solutions approach unity , and thus a normalization integral over the full @xmath88-space diverges in any case .",
    "however , the four bounded solutions @xmath82 and @xmath83 may at least be called normalizable in the distributional sense . introducing a suitable integration weight they will even become normalizable in the usual sense .",
    "the transformation of the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ 1.16 ] ) into the ashtekar representation @xcite has been well - prepared during the last section by introducing the new triad variables @xmath72 via ( [ 1.21 ] ) . all that remains to be done now is to transform ( [ 1.23 ] ) to the generalized momenta @xmath89 conjugate to @xmath72 by performing a suitable fourier - transformation",
    ".    it will be crucial for all that follows that we shall choose _ not _ a standard fourier - transformation which is carried out along the real axes , but a generalized , complexified fourier - transformation defined as anyway , the standard `` @xmath81 '' has been absorbed in these new variables . ]",
    "@xmath90     + here we assume that @xmath91 is a smooth , three dimensional manifold with the following properties :    ( @xmath81)@xmath92 the integrand of ( [ 2.1 ] ) and its first and second derivatives with respect to @xmath89 vanish at the border @xmath93 of @xmath94 .",
    "( @xmath95 ) @xmath94 is completely contained within a domain where @xmath96 is a holomorphic function of @xmath89 .",
    "assuming these properties of @xmath94 it is possible to convert @xmath72 and @xmath97 to the new variables : it turns out that they obey exactly the classical conversion rules    @xmath98     + where for brevity @xmath99 , i.e. the form of the fourier - transformed equation is independent of the choice of @xmath94 and unaffected by our complexification procedure !    the transformed equation ( [ 1.23 ] ) now reads    @xmath100     + which we will refer to as the wheeler - dewitt equation in the ashtekar representation .",
    "an exact solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation with non - vanishing cosmological constant can now be easily constructed : as in section ii.b we try to make vanish each term of the hamiltonian of ( [ 2.3 ] ) seperately , i.e. we seek for a solution obeying the three equations    @xmath101     + furthermore , one may even try to solve    @xmath102     + for each set of @xmath103 simultaneously .",
    "this requirement gives the unique solution    @xmath104     + this solution is even known for the general spatially inhomogeneous case , where the exponent is given by the chern - simons functional @xcite . in @xcite the semi - classical content of the wave function ( [ 2.6 ] ) was analyzed within the ashtekar representation .",
    "here we shall be interested , instead , in its transformation to the metric representation .",
    "in @xcite the transformation back to metric variables was also attempted , but without success . in the following",
    ", we shall make use of the freedom in the choice of contours in the generalized fourier - transformation ( [ 2.1 ] ) to derive _ several different _ solutions in the metric representation which are all generated from ( [ 2.6 ] ) by the choice of topologically inequivalent contours .",
    "by defintion , the generalized fourier - transform ( [ 2.1 ] ) of ( [ 2.6 ] ) represents an exact solution of the wheeler - dewitt operator ( [ 1.23 ] ) in the @xmath72-representation : each wavefunction of the form    @xmath105     + where @xmath94 is chosen to imply a sufficiently large fall - off for the integrand on @xmath93 , is a solution for the bianchi type ix model with cosmological constant . in ( [ 3.1 ] ) new variables    @xmath106     + have been introduced .",
    "we will show that there exist _ several _ manifolds @xmath94 satisfying the conditions ( @xmath81 ) and ( @xmath95 ) , corresponding to _ different _ solutions in the metric representation , so obviously , due to the existence of several topologically inequivalent contours , the generalized fourier - transformation is not unique .",
    "it will turn out that for the space of exact solutions defined via ( [ 3.1 ] ) the number and location of the saddle - points of the integrand s exponent    @xmath107     + will play an essential role . while for the asymptotic form of the solutions obtained from ( [ 3.1 ] ) by the saddle - point method",
    "the importance of the saddle - points is obvious and well - known @xcite , their importance for the _ exact _ solutions is a surprise , which arises because of the freedom in the choice of the integration contours .",
    "these saddle - points are determined by the equations    @xmath108     + which in the case @xmath109 may be rewritten in the form    @xmath110 { { \\cal a}}_{2}\\,(1-{{\\cal a}}_{3}^{2})&=&\\kappa_{2}+\\kappa_{1}\\ , { { \\cal a}}_{3}\\ , \\label{3.6}\\\\[0.4 cm ] ( { { \\cal a}}_{3}-\\kappa_{3})\\,(1- { { \\cal a}}_{3}^{2})^{2}\\!\\!&=&(\\kappa_{1}+\\kappa_{2}\\ , { { \\cal a}}_{3})(\\kappa_{2}+\\kappa_{1}\\ , { { \\cal a}}_{3})\\ .\\label{3.7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + the third equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) is of fifth order and so yields five different solutions , which correspond to five different saddle - points via ( [ 3.6 ] ) and ( [ 3.5 ] ) .    one may show that also in the remaining case @xmath111 ( [ 3.4 ] ) has five different solutions with @xmath112-components still obeying ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "the fact that there always exist five saddle - points of the integrand s exponent will be shown to result in a five dimensional space of solutions ( [ 3.1 ] ) .    for concreteness ,",

    "0 cm    knowing the saddle - points of @xmath136 , one may now calculate the curves of steepest descent for the two different regimes by solving the equations    @xmath148     + the result of a numerical approach to this problem is given in fig.@xmath145 [ grcsd ] . in the stripe @xmath149 all solutions of ( [ 3.22 ] ) are presented .",

    "it is easily seen that all curves end at _ essential _ singularities of the integrand of ( [ 3.18 ] ) in such directions that the integrand and _ all _ its @xmath137-derivatives vanish .",

    "@xmath159 denotes the scalar product of the underlying hilbert space which we do not know explicitly .",
    "but even if we knew it , an analytical treatment of this normalization procedure would certainly not be tractable .",

    "if the euclidean geometries are considered , which arise from the semi - classical trajectories in the euclidean domain of minisuperspace by introducing an imaginary time variable @xmath314 , the two solutions behave very differently : while a universe described by the no - boundary state becomes isotropic and remains regular in approaching @xmath217 , the vilenkin - trajectories diverge in some @xmath86-directions for @xmath78 , i.e. the corresponding euclidean 4-geometry behaves singular for small scale parameters .",
    "if one considers the euclidean approach to the caustic then all trajectories generated by the vilenkin state reach the caustic in the isotropic point @xmath315 , whereas the no - boundary trajectories run to infinite anisotropy .",
    "the creation of a classical universe with pseudo - riemannian geometry happens by a tunneling process through this caustic .",
    "the tunneling probability is given as the value of @xmath243 on the caustic and thus is a function of @xmath86 only ( @xmath6 taken as fixed ) .",
    "the results for these distributions , which rule the initial values for the classical evolution of the universe , are shown in fig.@xmath145 [ grkv ] and fig.@xmath145 [ grknb ] and predict both an isotropic universe as the most probable classical universe among all alternatives .",
    "however , just the no - boundary distribution is sharply concentrated about @xmath193 and integrable with respect to the anisotropy variables , whereas the vilenkin distribution is broader and _ not _ integrable ( even though bounded ) .    in the lorentzian regime",
    "both wavefunctions describe a desitter - like universe , which becomes more and more isotropic as @xmath5 tends to infinity . as a difference , @xmath278 always describes expanding and collapsing universes simultaneously , while @xmath180 just describes the expanding phase , and thus is not invariant under time reversal .",
    "in summary one might prefer the no - boundary solution @xmath278 as _ the _ quantum state of the universe .",
    "however , we should stress the fact that it is not the no - boundary idea itself which picks out uniquely this solution among the five solutions described by the chern - simons functional , but several additional , physically well - motivated integrability conditions have to be imposed on the solution to get @xmath278 .",
    "then , the resulting wavefunction _ is found _ to satisfy the no - boundary proposal _ in the semi - classical limit _",
    "@xmath2 .    finally , it may be of interest to consider the application of the results obtained here to a model with a massive , scalar matter - field .",
    "we want to show in brief that the @xmath6-solutions found above are directly applicable to this model in the limit @xmath316 :                 + comparing with ( [ 1.20 ] ) it is easily seen that in the limit @xmath316 this term corresponds exactly to the contribution which arises from a cosmological constant @xmath324 .",
    "thus one obtains the asymtotic solution for the bianchi type ix model with a massive , scalar field        as an interesting project for future consideration we leave the application of the generalized fourier - transformation to the general form of the chern - simons functional @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to determine whether again a vilenkin and a no - boundary state are obtained as topologically inequivalent functional integrals from the chern - simons solutions .",
    "work in this direction is in progress ."
