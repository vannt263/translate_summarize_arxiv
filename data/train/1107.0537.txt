    "for rank @xmath1 classical families of finite complex reflection groups @xmath3 , we contribute to the description of the diagonal co - quasi - invariant space @xmath5 for @xmath3 , in several ( say @xmath0 ) sets of @xmath1 variables . here",
    ", the use of the term diagonal refers to the fact that @xmath3 is considered as a diagonal subgroup of @xmath6 , acting on the @xmath7-tensor power @xmath8 of the symmetric algebra of the defining representation of @xmath3 . instead of the usual one ,",
    "the action considered here is the so - called hivert - action .",
    "invariant polynomials under this action are known as quasi - invariants ( or quasi - symmetric for the symmetric group ) .",
    "our space @xmath9 is simply the quotient of @xmath8 by the ideal generated by constant - term - free quasi - invariants for @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the associated multigraded hilbert series , denoted @xmath10 ( which is symmetric in the @xmath11 ) , can be described in an uniform manner as a positive coefficient linear combination of schur polynomials @xmath12 with the @xmath13 independent of @xmath0 , and @xmath14 running through a finite set of integer partitions that depend only on the group @xmath3 .",
    "this a typical phenomena in many similar situations such as considered in  @xcite . it has the striking feature that we can give explicit formulas for the dimension of @xmath9 for all @xmath0 . to see why this is so striking",
    ", it may be worthwhile to recall that , for the entirely analogous context of diagonal co - invariant spaces ( i.e. the one corresponding to the usual diagonal action of @xmath3 on @xmath8 ) , a large body of work has only recently settled the special case @xmath15 , but that we know almost nothing yet for @xmath16 .",
    "a down to earth description of our context may be given as follows .",
    "consider a @xmath17 matrix of variables @xmath18 .",
    "for any fixed @xmath19 ( a row of @xmath20 ) , we say that the variables form the @xmath21 _ _ . in some instances it is worth simplifying this notation , and",
    "write @xmath22 thus , @xmath23 stands for the first set of variables , @xmath24 for the second set , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for the last set .    with the aim of certain describing polynomials in the variables @xmath20",
    ", we choose to denote by @xmath27 the @xmath28 column of @xmath20 , for @xmath29 .",
    "we assume the same convention for any @xmath17 matrix of non - negative integers @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , if the @xmath31 are the columns of @xmath30 , we write @xmath32 we then consider the monomials @xmath33 for the monomials @xmath34 , who clearly form a basis of space of polynomials @xmath35 $ ] , the corresponding _ _ : @xmath36 lies in @xmath4 .    given @xmath37 ,",
    "recall that the _ _ @xmath2 may be described as the group of @xmath38 matrices having exactly one non zero coefficient in each row and each column , which is a @xmath39 root of unity .",
    "one usually considers @xmath3 as acting on polynomials in @xmath40 $ ] by replacement of the variables by the matrix @xmath41 . with this point of view",
    ", we may consider that @xmath3 is generated by the _ _",
    "@xmath42 , which exchange columns @xmath43 and @xmath44 in @xmath20 , together with @xmath45 which multiplies the first column of @xmath20 by a ( chosen ) primitive @xmath39 root of unity .",
    "these generators @xmath42 satisfy the usual coxeter relations for @xmath46 : @xmath47 for the special pseudo - reflection @xmath45 , we have @xmath48 and @xmath49 . this is the diagonal action which is considered for the `` usual '' definition of the diagonal co - invariant space for @xmath3 ( see  @xcite ) . rather than this space",
    ", we consider a variant below .",
    "our point of departure from the `` classical '' situation is to consider rather the diagonal quasi - invariant polynomials for @xmath3 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath50 ( the symmetric group @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 , we have the quasi - invariant ( or quasi - symmetric ) polynomials : @xmath53 for @xmath15 , another @xmath51-quasi - invariant is the polynomial @xmath54 the vector space of diagonally quasi invariant for @xmath2 is spanned by the _ _",
    "@xmath55 , which are indexed by _ _ .",
    "these are the positive integer entries @xmath56 matrices , @xmath57 , having all column sums congruent to @xmath58 mod @xmath59 , with no column sum actually vanishing .",
    "we say that we have an _ _ if this last condition is dropped .",
    "the monomial quasi - invariant associated to such a @xmath59-composition - matrix is simply defined as @xmath60 with @xmath61 running over all matrices obtained by selecting ( in the order that they appear ) @xmath62 columns of @xmath20 .",
    "we sometimes write @xmath63 $ ] for @xmath64 .",
    "it is easy to check directly that this is indeed a basis .",
    "for example , we have @xmath65=\\sum_{a < b } x_{a}\\,z_{a}^2\\,x_{b}^3\\,y_{b}.\\ ] ] we simply denote by ( or often simply by ) the ideal generated by constant - term - free diagonally @xmath3-quasi - invariant polynomials .",
    "we may now define our main object of study , which is the _ _ space : @xmath66 to better analyze the structure of this space , we need to consider the action of the general linear group @xmath67 on @xmath8 , defined by @xmath68 observing that the ideal @xmath69 is invariant under this action , we conclude that @xmath70 inherits a @xmath67-module structure . since the ideal @xmath71 is homogeneous for the vector - degree , @xmath70 may be graded by this same vector - degree , i.e. : @xmath72 with @xmath73 denoting the homogeneous component of degree @xmath74 of @xmath9 .",
    "it follows that the associated _ _ , , coincides with the character of @xmath70 as a @xmath67-module . to help the reader parse this statement ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath75 is a basis consisting of homogeneous elements of @xmath70 .",
    "this means that , for @xmath76 in @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 where @xmath79 stands for the diagonal matrix @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus , an homogeneous @xmath76 is an eigenvector of the linear transform @xmath82 sending @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "recall here that , by definition , the trace of @xmath82 , as a function of the @xmath11 , is the character of @xmath70 . summing up , the hilbert series of the space , defined by the expression @xmath85 coincides with the ( also usual ) definition of the character of the corresponding ( polynomial ) representation of @xmath67 .",
    "the point of this last observation is that @xmath86 is _ _ , since schur functions @xmath87 appear as characters of irreducible representations of @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , the decomposition into irreducibles of the polynomial @xmath67-representation @xmath86 gives a formula of the form  ( [ schur_generic ] ) , with @xmath14 running through all partitions for which the homogeneous component @xmath88 is non - vanishing .",
    "for example , for the symmetric group , one finds the following expressions for @xmath89 @xmath90 these examples exhibit the announced striking `` independence '' with respect to @xmath0 . before going on with our discussion ,",
    "let us introduce another @xmath67-module which is isomorphic ( both as a @xmath67-module and a @xmath3-module ) to the space @xmath9 .",
    "for each of the variables @xmath91 , consider the partial derivation denoted by @xmath92 , or @xmath93 for short .",
    "for a polynomial @xmath76 , we then denote by @xmath94 the differential operator obtained by replacing the variables in @xmath95 by the corresponding derivation in @xmath96 .",
    "the space of _ _ with respect to @xmath3-quasi - invariants is simply defined to be the set of polynomial solutions @xmath97 of the system of partial differential equations @xmath98 evidently , we need only consider a generating set of @xmath71 for these equations to characterize all solutions . the elementary proof ( see  @xcite ) that @xmath9 and @xmath99 are isomorphic relies on the fact that there is a scalar product for which @xmath99 appears as the orthogonal complement of @xmath100 .",
    "following our established conventions , stands for the _ _ of the graded space @xmath99 . from the above discussion",
    ", this is equal to the hilbert series @xmath101 .",
    "the advantage of working with @xmath99 is that we may present a basis in terms of explicit polynomials ( which give canonical representatives for equivalence classes in @xmath9 ) . to get a better feeling of how things work out ,",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath102 and @xmath15 . we may then check that we have the following bases @xmath103 for the various homogeneous components @xmath104 of the space @xmath105 . @xmath106",
    "observe that we can calculate @xmath107 from @xmath108 by exchanging all @xmath109 by the corresponding @xmath110 .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath111 , the space @xmath112 affords the following bases .",
    "for all @xmath74 of the form @xmath113 , we may choose @xmath114 . to get the bases for the other non - vanishing components of @xmath115 , we set @xmath116 equal to the set of polynomials obtained by exchanging the @xmath110 by the corresponding @xmath117 for all elements of @xmath118 .",
    "in turn , we get @xmath119 from @xmath116 , now exchanging the @xmath120-variables for the @xmath121-variables . it can then be checked that there are no other non - vanishing component in @xmath122 .",
    "one may also use theorem  [ mainthm ] to see this .",

    ", we may consider that the symmetric function involved in these expressions are written in terms of infinitely many variables @xmath127 this makes formula  ( [ schur_generic ] ) entirely independent of @xmath0 . to get the hilbert series in the special case of @xmath0 sets of @xmath1 variables",
    ", we simply specialize this `` universal '' formula by setting all variables @xmath128 , for @xmath129 , equal to zero .",
    "this process is made even more transparent by `` removing the variables '' , writing @xmath130 ( or @xmath131 ) instead of @xmath87 ( or @xmath132 ) for the complete homogeneous symmetric functions . ] in ( [ schur_generic ] ) . in other words , we consider @xmath133 as the evaluation , of a ( variable free ) symmetric functions @xmath134 , inn the set of @xmath0 variables @xmath135 .",
    "we may also drop the @xmath0 in @xmath9 .",
    "the following formula , for the case @xmath52 , is shown to hold in  @xcite .",
    "namely , for the group @xmath2 , we have @xmath136 in particular , for @xmath137 , we get @xmath138 since @xmath139 , this is readily seen to be the specialization at @xmath140 of the following `` universal '' formula ( see  @xcite ) , for the groups @xmath141 : @xmath142 as such , it holds for the diagonal co - invariant space ( under the classical action ) which , in this very specific case , coincides with the space of diagonal co - quasi - invariant space .",
    "a nice feature of the expression given in  ( [ formule_gr2 ] ) is its _ _ : @xmath143 this appears to hold for many other reflection groups , in particular when @xmath3 is a symmetric group , leading us to state the following .",

    "the passage from ( [ formule_q1 ] ) to ( [ formule_q2 ] ) is classical .",
    "it follows that    [ mainprop ] conjecture  [ conj ] implies that @xmath150 affords an expression of the form @xmath151 with @xmath148 running over the set of all dyck paths of height @xmath1 , and @xmath152 some partition of the integer @xmath149 . here",
    "@xmath153 stands for equality in degrees less or equal to @xmath146 .    as of this writing",

    "we discuss now how to get explicit polynomial formulas in the variable @xmath1 for the coefficient of @xmath131 , when @xmath14 is a partition of a small enough integer .",
    "we restrict the discussion to the case @xmath154 , but much of it holds in generality .",
    "we exploit here the fact that low degree homogeneous components of the spaces @xmath155 and @xmath156 are isomorphic , where @xmath157 stands for the ring of diagonal quasi - symmetric polynomials .",
    "this immediately implies that we have explicit formulas for the relevant homogeneous components of @xmath158 , since we have the explicit expressions @xmath159 where @xmath160 .",

    "in light of the results and conjecture considered above , we think it worthwhile to reformulate results obtained in @xcite from this new perspective . indeed , the relevant formulas take a new and much nicer format which gives indirect support to our conjecture , since the hilbert series considered happen to be provably @xmath145-positive . this",
