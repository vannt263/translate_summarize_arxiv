    "entanglement is one of central characteristics in quantum information theory , as it contains correlations that do not have a classical counterpart .",
    "entangled states can be prepared by correlations stronger than those of local classical systems assisted with classical communication , but they do not exhibit arbitrarily strong correlations . therefore ,",
    "quantum theory is consistent with relativistic theories .    along the line , it is of fundamental question in relativistic quantum information theory how the behavior of entanglement can be described in a relativistic setting , particularly when one of parties is traveling in an acceleration @xcite @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from two parties who share entangled states , while one remains in an inertial frame and the other is described in accelerated frame .",
    "it is highly nontrivial that , even though entanglement in bosonic systems disappears in the limit of infinite acceleration , entanglement in fermionic systems can survive in the limit @xcite@xcite .",
    "this is remarkable in that entanglement related to correlations can behave differently , depending on fields , and can also persist in such a limit .",
    "however the analysis for the fermionic system was only based on the single - mode approximation@xcite@xcite . to obtain a precise understanding in the limit",
    ", it follows that one has to give a full consideration beyond single - mode approximation .",
    "this has been attempted , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is however , hard to interpret physically .",
    "the question in fact lies with the peculiarity of fermionic system , that gives rise to the ambiguity in the ordering of operators .",
    "note that , as it is mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , what matters is to find an ordering that has the physical relevance , i.e. such that entanglement is characterized by what is observed by detectors . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such an ordering beyond single mode approximation is also proposed . in ref.@xcite the ordering",
    "is then applied to explain entanglement in the infinite acceleration so the physicality of the fermionic structure is provided and the independence of the choice of unruh mode in the infinite acceleration limit is discussed .",
    "+ however the ordering was tested only in the example considered in ref .",
    "therefore in this work , beyond the single - mode approximation , we investigate the behavior of entanglement of fermonic systems using the recent construction proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for both pure and mixed states . in this way",
    ", the construction is extensively tested for a number of entangled states .",
    "we show that in all of these cases , the ordering constructed leads to convergence of fermonic entanglement in the infinite acceleration , i.e. it yields physical results .",
    "this also corrects the previously known analysis on the entanglement behavior in ref .",
    "finally , our results provide strong evidence that the ordering suggested recently would characterize entanglement as it gives physical results .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ acc ] , we will briefly review how fermionic systems are described in a non - inertial frame . in sec .",
    "[ ex ] , the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite is applied and the entanglement behavior of the fermionic system in an accelerated frame is shown . in sec .",
    "[ con ] we will conclude and discuss our results .",
    "let us begin with quantum fields in relativistic frames . a party traveling with a uniform acceleration",
    "is described by the so - called rindler coordinate @xmath0 , which has the following relation with minkowski coordinate @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a fixed acceleration of the frame and @xmath4 is the velocity of light . for fixed @xmath5 , the coordinate can be found as hyperbolic trajectories in space - time .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . equation ( [ eq1 ] ) only covers the region ( i ) in fig .",
    "the region ( ii ) is covered by @xmath6 .",
    "the other two regions ( f and p ) can be described as @xmath7 .     and @xmath8 are causally disconnected",
    ". transformations of coordinates among regions @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are explained in the text .",
    ", width=359 ]    now let us consider the field in minkowski and rindler spacetime , which can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are normalization constants .",
    "also @xmath15 denotes the positive and negative energy solutions of the dirac equation in minkowski spacetime , which can be obtained with respect to the killing vector field in minkowski spacetime , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the positive and negative energy solutions of the dirac equation in rindler spacetime , with respect to the killing vector field in regions i and ii .",
    "in addition @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the positive and negative energy solutions ( particle and antiparticle ) , where @xmath20 denotes @xmath21 .",
    "then they satisfy the anticommutation relations @xmath22 .",
    "it is known that the combination of minkowski mode , called unruh mode , can be transformed into a monochromatic rindler mode and can annihilate the same minkowski vacuum .",
    "the following relation thus holds : @xmath23 where @xmath24 . a more general relation",
    "can also be found , @xmath25 by which one can go beyond the single - mode approximation .    using these relations , in case of grassmann scalar",
    ", the unruh vacuum can be given by @xmath26 here we use the notation @xmath27 .",
    "then , one - particle states can be obtained as@xmath28 from now on , for both convenience and simplicity , we restrict our consideration to cases when @xmath29 and @xmath30 are real numbers , and we also omit the index @xmath31 throughout . in eqs .",

    "@xcite @xcite , and we derive the entanglement behavior accordingly . for bipartite pure entanglement , the entanglement property of quantum states can be simplified greatly due to the schmidt decomposition , by which a given quantum state can be expressed using a single parameter .",
    "that is , the decomposition allows any bipartite pure state to be in the expression @xmath34 for some @xmath35 , with a set of orthonormal basis @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    to quantify entanglement",
    ", we apply the measure called _ negativity _ , which is based on the partial transpose of quantum states , i.e. taking transpose to the state of either system of two parties @xcite .",
    "then , for a given quantum state @xmath38 , negativity @xmath39 can be computed as follows : @xmath40 in which @xmath41 are negative eigenvalues of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 denotes the partial transpose @xcite .",
    "note that the measure - negativity - is useful as a computable measure in various contexts .    with these ,",
    "the entanglement behavior is to be studied in the following scenario .",
    "suppose that two parties , called alice and bob , share entangled states in inertial frames in the beginning . afterward , bob moves with a uniform acceleration .",
    "we then show that entanglement in the infinite acceleration allows us to obtain physical results . in particular , results shown in sec .",

    "we first consider pure entanglement between alice and bob .",
    "as was mentioned , suppose that two parties share a pure state and bob travels with a uniform acceleration .",
    "then , the state shared is described as @xmath44 , two regions @xmath9 and @xmath8 are causally disconnected and thus bob does not have assess to both .",
    "hence , the state between alice and bob can be found by tracing either regions .",
    "first , the state of alice and bob when bob is in region @xmath9 is described as @xmath45 and , the state of alice and antibob ( i.e. in bob s region ii ) is then expressed after tracing the region @xmath9 , as follows : @xmath46 note that these are exact expressions , not obtained from the single - mode approximation .",
