    "in an outreach paper written in the heyday of elemental fermiology , mackintosh remarked that while `` few people would define a metal as a ` solid with a fermi surface ' , this may nevertheless be the most meaningful definition of a metal.''@xcite . in opposition to a metal",
    ", a semiconductor can be defined as a solid deprived of a fermi surface .    doping a semiconductor@xcite ,",
    "can eventually turn it to to metal .",
    "this metal - insulator transition@xcite has been a central issue of the condensed - matter physics during the second half of the twentieth century .",
    "the most - explored system has been silicon doped with phosphorus , its immediate neighbor to the right in the periodical table .",
    "experiment has identified a sharp transition and has accurately measured the critical concentration of dopants for emergence of metallicity@xcite . above this threshold concentration ,",
    "silicon becomes metallic : it conducts electricity at zero - temperature .",
    "this is an alternative definition of a metal@xcite and more inclusive than the one mentioned above .",
    "historically , the debate on metal - insulator transition have been focused on `` weak metallicity '' , which only requires the presence of mobile electrons at zero temperature and not `` strong metallicity '' , which implies the existence of a well - defined fermi surface . in a variety of insulators ,",
    "the critical concentration of dopants for metal - insulator transition has been identified by experiment @xcite and the results match the expectations of the mott criterion for metal - insulator transition@xcite , which identifies the effective bohr radius of the host insulator as the key parameter in a given material .",
    "[ adapted from ref.@xcite ) ] .",
    "they attest to the existence of a well - defined fermi surface and quantify the amplitude of the fermi energy .",
    "c ) the results imply that the chemical potential is 1mev above the bottom of the conduction band separated from the valence band by a gap of 3 ev .",
    "d ) the seafloor is this shallow fermi sea is rough and the low - temperature mean - free - path of electrons is set by the average distance between islands or trenches , which are potential scattering centers.,width=529 ]    according to the pauli exclusion principle , electrons of a solid which share the same discrete quantum numbers ( such as spin and valley ) can not have the same wave - vector .",
    "they will fill k - states in a fermi - dirac distribution with an edge separating the filled and empty states .",
    "the sharpness of this edge is set by the inverse of the mean - free - path , which defines the size of pixel in the k space .",
    "a sharp fermi surface has an experimental signature other than a finite zero - temperature electric conductance .",
    "landau quantification truncates a fermi surface to a number of concentric tubes leading to quantum oscillations in various physical properties@xcite . in many doped semiconductors , such oscillations",
    "have been reported decades ago .",
    "the list includes n - doped strontium titanate@xcite , doped iv - vi semiconductors such as pbs @xcite , pbte@xcite and snte@xcite .",
    "this is also the case of heavily - doped germanium@xcite .",
    "a recent study of nernst effect in srtio@xmath4 found quantum oscillations of a very large magnitude with a single and well - defined frequency ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this result implies that this wide - gap semiconductor , after loosing one out of its 10@xmath5 oxygen atoms , becomes a metal in the strongest sense of the word : a solid with a fermi surface .    from this perspective ,",
    "one unexpected finding of the recent research on topological insulators is instructive .",
    "the quest to find ultra - mobile electrons on the surface protected from backscattering mostly documented _ bulk _",
    "mobile electrons giving rise to easily - detectable quantum oscillations@xcite .",
    "it is now clear that topological insulators are often on the metallic - side of the metal - insulator transition as a consequence of uncontrolled doping and a long bohr radius in the bulk .",
    "the irony was not pursued however .",
    "bulk electrons were often treated as a nuisance , impeding topological `` insulators '' to qualify as true insulators .",
    "their proper mobility , with notable exceptions@xcite , was not put under scrutiny .",
    "the subject of the present paper is the intrinsic limit to carrier mobility in a dilute metal made by the introduction of a random distribution of dopants in a semiconductor with sufficiently long bohr radius .",
    "a pattern is visible in the available experimental data . in these systems , at identical carrier density , mobility of electrons is much higher than in metallic silicon or metallic germanium .",
    "moreover , the variation with carrier concentration is quite distinct .",
    "the main argument of this paper is that both the magnitude of the mobility and its density dependence can be understood by conceiving the simplest model for the probability of finding a scattering center in a shallow fermi sea .",
    "the key parameter remains the bohr radius of the host insulator , which by setting the thomas - fermi screening length , shapes the local seafloor of the fermi sea .",
    "1 occurs almost simultaneously . on the other hand , in pbte and srtio@xmath6 , which have both a long bohr radius , mobility enhances with decreasing carrier concentration and localization is easily avoided .",
    "solid horizontal lines mark the required mobility to see detect quantum oscillations at a given magnetic field.,width=529 ]    fig . 2",
    "compares the hall mobility at liquid - helium temperature of of four different semiconductors as a function of carrier concentration between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the reported data for phosphorus - doped silicon@xcite , arsenic - doped@xcite , antimony - doped@xcite and gallium - doped@xcite germanium are presented together with those for p - doped@xcite and n - doped@xcite pbte , as well as for oxygen - deficient srtio@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the figure reveals several remarkable features .",
    ".normalised electric permittivity , @xmath9 , the average effective , @xmath10 , and the effective bohr radius ( a@xmath11 ) , in four different semiconductors . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this paper puts under scrutiny an experimental fact already reported but rarely analyzed . in metallic semiconductors with a long bohr radius ,",
    "mobility is large and continuously decreases with increasing carrier density .",
    "both these features are absent in silicon or germanium . according to the argument proposed here ,",
    "this happens because in these metallic semiconductors the global distribution of dopants shapes the local seafloor . for this to happen",
    ", a threshold concentration of dopants is required .",
    "this second critical concentration becomes attainable only when the bohr radius is long enough . with a set of most unsophisticated assumptions",
    ", one can formulate an expression for the intrinsic mobility of a metallic semiconductor with random distribution of dopants . in spite of neglecting subtle details ,",
    "the expression is in good agreement with the data on four different semiconductors .",
