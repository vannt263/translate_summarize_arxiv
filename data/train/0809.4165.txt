    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 t magnetic field .",
