    "the discussion that follows , about the behavior of defects in the sma ( smectic a ) phase is inspired by a few experimental polarized light microscopy observations reported in @xcite and summarized below .",
    "these observations have since been developed @xcite .",
    "they relate to a domain of temperature that extends approximately @xmath0 below the sma @xmath1 n phase transition , some of the most relevant experiments having been done with an accuracy of @xmath2 .",
    "the very near vicinity of the transition , where phenomena usually qualified of transitional do happen , is not investigated here .",
    "but , even in the domain we have searched , the focal conic domains suffer considerable visible modifications , which we attribute to their interactions with dislocations .",
    "it is precisely the nature of these interactions that we wish to describe in the present article .",
    "the defects and textures of the sma and n phases are reasonably well understood at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales , at least for their static physical and topological properties .",
    "contrariwise , the role played by the smectic defects at the phase transition has been little investigated .",
    "it is precisely in this region that the fcd s ( focal conic domains ) , the only defects that are fully observable in light microscopy , show large modifications that , we believe , are essentially due to their interactions with dislocations .",
    "the sma @xmath1 n phase transition has been the object of many investigations ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the compression modulus @xmath3 becomes smaller and tends towards a finite value ( equal to or slightly different from zero , see e.g. , @xcite ) ; its variation is noticeable in a large temperature range ( more than half a degree in the compounds that we have investigated ) .",
    "note that in this range , @xmath4 ( the splay modulus ) stays practically constant .",
    "the question of @xmath5 ( the saddle - splay modulus ) has been little investigated yet , either theoretically or experimentally ( see @xcite for the nematic phase ) ; the results that follow have been interpreted by assuming that @xmath5 too stays practically constant .",
    "@xmath6 ( the twist modulus ) is infinite in layered media , twist being forbidden by the layer geometry .",
    "let us now recall some defect features of the sma phase .",
    "these defects are of two types , focal conic domains ( which are special types of disclinations ) and dislocations : + - _ focal conic domains ( fcd s ) _ : the layers are parallel , so that there is no strain energy but only curvature energy .",
    "the normals to the layers envelop two focal surfaces on which the curvature is infinite ( the energy diverges ) .",
    "the focal surfaces are degenerate into lines in order to minimize this large curvature energy .",
    "these lines are necessarily two confocal conics , an ellipse and a hyperbola , observable by optical microscopy @xcite .",
    "the layers are folded along _ dupin cyclides _ , surfaces that have the topology of tori . and",
    "indeed the simplest geometric case is when the ellipse e is degenerate into a circle - the confocal hyperbola h being degenerate into a straight line perpendicular to the plane of the circle and going through its centre . in this case",
    "the layers are nested tori , restricted in fact to those parts of the tori that have negative gaussian curvature @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 case is indeed the most usual case met experimentally in generic dupin cyclides , see @xcite .",
    "we shall not consider in the sequel the situations where the layers are restricted to those parts that have positive gaussian curvature ; and as a matter of fact the mixed case is not observed . in the toric case just alluded , the focal conic _",
    "domain _ is the region of space occupied by those nested layers restricted to their @xmath8 parts ; it is bound by a cylinder parallel to h and whose cross section is e. in the generic case , the region of space where the layers have @xmath8 is bound by two half - cylinders of revolution , that meet on the ellipse , and whose generatrices are parallel to the hyperbola asymptotes fig.1a .",
    "this is the picture of an ideal , _ complete _ , fcd .",
    "fig.1b illustrates a case where @xmath8 and @xmath9 regions are visible in the same fcd ; it does not correspond to any situation met in practice .",
    "models for _ incomplete _ fcd s are shown farther ahead ( fig.9 ( a and b ) ) . the important question how fcd s are packed in space @xcite will be approached , but just incidentally . + the curvature energy @xmath10 of an entire , ideal , focal conic domain depends on @xmath4 and @xmath11 :    @xmath12+f_{core}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the semi - major axis of the ellipse , @xmath14 the semi - minor axis , @xmath15 the eccentricity and @xmath16 the complete elliptic integral of the first species @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the energy @xmath17 attached to the thickness variation of the layers is negligible compared to @xmath10 .",
    "very little is known about the core contribution @xmath18 , but it is usually assumed that it scales as @xmath19 .",
    "thus , at @xmath13 and @xmath15 constant , the fcd total energy does not vary significantly in the domain of temperature under investigation , if our assumptions about the temperature variation of @xmath4 and @xmath11 turn to be true .",
    "+ - _ screw dislocation lines and edge dislocation lines : _ : their line energies per unit length can be written : + @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dislocation burgers vector ( @xmath22 is the layer thickness ) and @xmath23 is the core radius .",
    "it is visible that the elastic contributions ( the off - core terms in eq .",
    "2 ) decrease when @xmath24 gets closer to @xmath25 , because @xmath3 decreases and the core energies are expected to be approximately constant - in a nave model inspired by the solid - liquid transition , these energies are of order @xmath26 per unit length of dislocation line , _ i.e. _ small , @xmath27 being the volume occupied by a molecule , and @xmath23 being perhaps of order @xmath28 for a screw dislocation , @xmath22 for an edge dislocation , _ i.e. _ practically constant .",
    "the decrease of @xmath3 is effective on a large temperature domain before the transition , probably larger than @xmath0 , see @xcite .",
    "the core radii scale as the correlation lengths very close to the transition , but this region is of no interest to us . + _",
    "comments on the experimental conditions _ + the fcd s are static in the lower range of the domain of temperature we have investigated , they quite often display variations to their ideal shape . the transformation of the fcd s , when approaching the transition , is visible with a simple optical microscopy set up .",
    "it appears as a rather sudden phenomenon , about half a degree below @xmath25 , at a temperature @xmath29 that depends slightly on the boundary conditions .",
    "we shall assume that it is due to an abrupt multiplication of dislocations , which then interact with fcd s when they are mobile enough .",
    "+ the spontaneous multiplication of screw dislocations close to the sma @xmath1 n transition is a well documented fact in _ lyotropic _ systems @xcite .",
    "our observations relate to _ thermotropic _ compounds , two belonging to the cyanobiphenyl series , 8cb , 9cb and one belonging to the cholesteryl series ( cn , nonanoate ) which also have a sm a @xmath1 n transition ; they incline us to believe that the phenomenon of spontaneous multiplication of dislocations ( screw but also edge ) is very general . in these compounds",
    "the focal conic domains suffer considerable modifications in the region close to the transition . in all cases ,",
    "either the fcd s disappear by shrinking before the phase transition , or the ellipse and the hyperbola transform into disclinations in the nematic phase ; the first situation occurs usually for small and medium size fcd s slowly heated , the second one occurs for large fcd s , when they are brought to the transition under faster heating .",
    "when cooling down from the nematic phase , the fcd texture in 8cb , 9cb and 8ocb usually does not display ideal fcd s .",
    "instead fcd fragments grow , join and form domains , which in many cases are not ideal fcd s .",
    "the double helical objects described in @xcite , which are splitting modes of giant screw dislocations , are obtained this way .",
    "these _ imperfect _ fcd s can be quenched to lower temperatures where they stabilize due to anchoring and viscosity barriers .",
    "the boundary conditions play an important role in the definition of the final texture .",
    "there is little doubt that the transformations of the fcd texture in 8cb , 9cb , cn , when approaching the nematic phase , as well as the formation of imperfect fcd s when coming from above , are due to the interaction of the fcd s with free dislocations .",
    "dislocations are generally not visible by optical microscopy , except when their burgers vector is large ( micron size ) , which situation occurs for edge dislocations , clustering into oily streaks @xcite or screw dislocations split into two @xmath30 disclinations @xcite .",
    "we argue here that the presence of numerous dislocations can be visualized via their distorting action on the fcd s , which are visible .",
    "essential for a better understanding of the modifications suffered by fcd s when interacting with dislocations are the following properties , that characterize them when they are in an _ ideal _ state .",
    "( a)- projected orthogonally upon a plane , along any direction , the ellipse e and the hyperbola h cross at right angles , fig.2a .",
    "this is a particular case of darboux s theorem @xcite , which states that if a congruence of straight lines is orthogonal to a set of parallel surfaces , the two focal surfaces @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( that this congruence generically envelops ) are such that the planes tangent to @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the contact points @xmath33 and @xmath34 of any line @xmath35 of the congruence are orthogonal .",
    "this is the reason why the projections of the ellipse e and the hyperbola h belonging to the same fcd look orthogonal . here",
    "the straight line @xmath35 is a normal to the dupin cyclides , and indicates the average direction of the molecules .",
    "darboux s theorem is empirically satisfied by a number of fcd s , which in that sense are ideal fcd s ; when it is not , ( see fig.2b ) it implies that the fcd in question is geometrically interacting with other defects , as we shall discuss in the sequel .",
    "( b)- two neighboring ideal fcd s whose ellipses are in the same plane and tangent at some point m are in contact along at least one line segment joining m to a point p at which the two hyperbolae intersect .",
    "this geometry , frequently observed , is a particular realization of the law of corresponding cones @xcite , a geometrical property that rules the way fcd s pack in space .",
    "a tilt grain boundary whose angle of misorientation @xmath36 is neither too small nor too large is usually made of a fcd packing such that the ellipses belong to the grain boundary , have a constant eccentricity @xmath37 , the asymptotes of the hyperbolae being parallel @xcite , see fig.3 .",
    "( c)- in a solid crystal , a tilt grain boundary is usually split into dislocations . the same is of course possible for a tilt grain boundary in a layered medium . and",
    "indeed the fcd free interstices ( the packing of ellipses in the plane of the grain boundary can not be perfect ) , are filled with dislocations @xcite .",
    "there is therefore a relation of equivalence between dislocations and focal conic domains @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the ellipse of an isolated fcd is the termination of a set of dislocations whose total burgers vector @xmath38 , as explained below . +",
    "disclinations are typical line defects in a medium endowed with a director order parameter @xcite .",
    "one distinguishes _ wedge _",
    "disclinations , whose rotation vector @xmath39 is along the disclination line , and _ twist _",
    "disclinations , whose rotation vector @xmath39 is orthogonal to the disclination line . as shown in @xcite , there are necessarily dislocations attached to a line segment of twist character .",
    "let us remind that the focal lines of a fcd , are , by nature , disclinations .",
    "the hyperbola is a disclination of strength @xmath40 , whose rotation vector ( @xmath41 ) varies in direction ( not in length ) all along the hyperbola : at each point of the hyperbola it is parallel to the tangent @xmath42 at this point .",
    "the layer geometry is axial - symmetric in the vicinity of the hyperbola .",
    "insofar as it is a disclination , the hyperbola is of wedge character ; there are no attached dislocations .",
    "the ellipse is a disclination of strength @xmath43 , whose rotation vector ( @xmath44 ) varies in direction but ( not in length ) all along the ellipse ; @xmath42 is in the plane of the ellipse and tangent to the layer inside the ellipse , fig.4 .",
    "the twist component induces the attachment of dislocations @xcite , see below .",
    "+      modifications to the twist / wedge character of a disclination can be achieved in the generic case by attaching / detaching new dislocations to the line .",
    "such operations modify the shape of the line , by the introduction of _ kinks _ , fig.5 .",
    "for instance , in order to attach at some point a on a wedge line @xmath45 a set of dislocations of total burgers vector @xmath46 , one has to introduce a kink @xmath47 , with a component perpendicular to @xmath48 , ( _ i.e. _ a segment @xmath47 having a twist component ) , such that @xmath49 where @xmath42 is an unit vector tangent to the line and @xmath39 ( @xmath50 ) is the rotation invariant carried by the disclination ; see @xcite and appendix for a demonstration of eq .",
    "( 3 ) . in practice lines of interest",
    "are of strength @xmath51 ; @xmath52 .",
    "reciprocally , the presence of a kink reveals the presence of dislocations attached to the line .",
    "the above picture of a kink says nothing about the nature ( edge or screw ) of the attached dislocations , and the way they relax and disperse through space about the disclination line . the line flexibility , _",
    "i.e. _ the main property at work when the medium is deformed , elastically or by flow , takes its origin here , in this interplay of the disclination line with dislocations . +",
    "a kink can be infinitesimally small ; @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an infinitesimal element along the line @xcite .",
    "a density of infinitesimally small kinks modifies the curvature of the line .",
    "a dislocation attached to an infinitesimally small kink has an infinitesimally small burgers vector ; a dislocation attached to a finite kink may have a finite burgers vector , as we see now .",
    "+      let us now consider in more detail the geometry of the attachment of dislocations to a focal line in a fcd .",
    "we first state some general properties , and then consider separately the case of the ellipse and the case of the hyperbola .",
    "again , the dislocations emanating from the kink have to belong to one of the two following categories : they are either dislocations with infinitesimal burgers vectors whose directions are parallel to the layer dislocations of the layer stacking , or with burgers vectors @xmath55 perpendicular to the layer ( these are the usual sma quantified dislocations ) .",
    "note that in both cases the burgers vectors are translation symmetry vectors ; they are perfect burgers vectors in the sense of the volterra process .",
    "we consider them successively .",
    "_ infinitesimal burgers vectors _ relate to dislocation densities that relax by the effect of viscosity ; they affect the curvature of the layers and consequently , as alluded just above , they also affect their thickness , since the layers have to keep in contact .",
    "we shall not expatiate on such defects , which are not relevant to our subject .",
    "just note that the theory has been developed for solids since long ; see @xcite for a general review .",
    "an essential point worth emphasizing is that a continuous density of infinitesimal dislocations can be attended by a strainless , elastically relaxed , state . in our case",
    ", this would correspond to a state where the layers keep parallel .",
    "continuous dislocation with burgers vectors parallel to the layers do not introduce any kind of singularity of the sma order parameter .",
    "4 indicates that the related kink @xmath54 and that @xmath42 are both perpendicular to @xmath56 , which condition does not specify any special direction for @xmath57 .    _",
    "finite burgers vectors _ :",
    "this case is better represented by eq .",
    "3 , because the burgers vector and the kink @xmath47 are finite .",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath42 have both to be in a plane tangent to the local layer .",
    "to an elementary dislocation @xmath58 corresponds an elementary kink .",
    "an elementary kink is microscopic ( @xmath59 ) ; one can thus possibly have a density of such elementary kinks , rendering the line curved when observed at a mesoscopic scale .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility that infinitesimally small dislocations are attached to finite kinks .",
    "simple as they look , the application of these criteria requires however some care . +      fig.4 is a schematic view of the properties of an ellipse , belonging to an ideal fcd , which are in relation to its @xmath43 disclination character .",
    "the layer geometry is different inside and outside the ellipse . , the dupin cyclide layers intersect the plane of the ellipse _",
    "perpendicularly_. , the layers are planar and _ perpendicular _ to the asymptotic directions , as more detailed below .",
    "the change of geometry between the inside and the outside is achieved by a rotation of the layers about the local rotation vector @xmath60 ; @xmath39 is parallel to the layers ( inside and outside ) and is along the intersection of the layers with the plane of the ellipse , inside .    the layer at m ( m being a running point on the ellipse ) is indeed folded inside about the local @xmath42 direction , is singular at m ( it is a conical point ) , and extends outside along a fold made of two half planes symmetrical with respect the ellipse plane , each perpendicular to one or the other of the two asymptotic directions of the confocal hyperbola , and thereby making an angle about a direction parallel to the minor axis of the ellipse ( see @xcite , chapter 10 ) .",
    "the ellipse plane outside the ellipse is therefore a tilt boundary of misorientation angle @xmath36 , which can be accommodated by edge dislocations of burgers vectors multiple of @xmath22 , perpendicular to the plane of the tilt boundary , _",
    "i.e. _ the plane of the ellipse outside . there is one such dislocation @xmath61 per layer counted inside the ellipse .",
    "+ the same result can be obtained by using eq .",
    "4 . let us parameterize the ellipse in polar coordinates with the origin at the physical focus , fig.6 .",
    "+ @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the polar angle .",
    "one then finds that the @xmath43 ellipse disclination is partially of twist character , with an attached burgers vector    @xmath65    the total burgers vector attached to the ellipse is @xmath66 , as indicated above .",
    "if one takes @xmath67 , - an approximation which makes sense ( up to second order ) , since @xmath22 is so small compared to the size @xmath13 of the ellipse - it is visible that the points @xmath68 and @xmath69 are on two parallel smectic layers at a distance @xmath22 .",
    "notice that the density of dislocations is constant if measured along the major axis : @xmath70 .",
    "there are no dislocations attached to the singular circle of a toric fcd , as the eccentricity e vanishes .",
    "an ellipse can be thought of as a circle kinked at the layer scale .",
    "the kinking of the ellipse takes different geometries , whether the dislocations at stake are located outside ( where @xmath71 is perpendicular to the plane ) or inside ( where @xmath71 is in the plane ) the fcd .",
    "_ outside the fcd _ : the mouse ( fig.7 ) .",
    "if the dislocation lines attached to the ellipse disperse _ away outside _ the focal conic domain , _",
    "i.e. _ in a region of space where the layers are in the plane of the ellipse ; @xmath42 , which varies in direction all along the ellipse , is in this plane . applying eq .",
    "3 , it appears that the kinks have to be in the plane of the ellipse .",
    "this configuration has been observed , in a situation where the kinks are so small and have such a high density that the kinked ellipse appears to be continuous , but its shape departs considerably from a perfect ellipse ; it is smoothly distorted by the in - plane kinks : we call it a mouse ( fig.7a ) .",
    "fig.7b provides a model for such kinks , ( which always go by pairs ) , drawn here at a scale which has no relation with the real scale .",
    "the photograph of fig.7a is taken from the rim of a free standing film , in a region where the thickness @xmath72 of the film is quickly changing , and the wedge angle @xmath36 between the opposite free boundaries varies monotonically .",
    "the anchoring conditions are homeotropic ; there is therefore a tilt boundary in the mid - plane of the film , but with a variable misorientation angle .",
    "the mouse is in this mid - plane ; the extra dislocations attached to the kinks ( edge dislocations in the mid - plane ) relax the variation of @xmath36 by contributing to the modification of the density @xmath73 of dislocations in this plane ; see [ 2 ] for a more detailed account .",
    "_ inside the fcd _ : the giraffe ( fig.8 ) .",
    "the layers rotate about @xmath42 by an angle of @xmath74 ; hence they become perpendicular to the plane of the ellipse , _ inside _ the fcd .",
    "therefore the dislocations that disperse away inside are attached to kinks that are perpendicular to the plane of the ellipse , on average .",
    "a pair of elementary kinks ( not at scale at all in the figure ) , symmetric with respect to the major axis , can be linked by a unique dislocation ( fig.8b ) .",
    "our observations ( fig.8a ) indicate the existence of another mode of kinking , with screw dislocations joining the kink ( of macroscopic size ) to the hyperbola ; another kink should then exist on the hyperbola , but is not visible .",
    "we call such a departure from the perfect ellipse , distorted by off - plane kinks , a giraffe. one can eventually imagine elementary kinks of the sort in discussion , all of the same sign , having a high density on the ellipse and continuously tilting its plane .",
    "such tilted ellipses have been observed in 8cb and 9cb @xcite .",
    "the situation observed in fig.8a results from the presence of a quasi planar _",
    "pretilted _ anchoring .",
    "a unique direction of pretilt is in conflict with the presence of an entire ellipse parallel to the boundary in its close vicinity ; hence opposite displacements of different parts of the ellipse along the vertical direction , to the point that one part gets off the boundary , and is virtual ; see @xcite for a more detailed account of this geometry and other geometries implying different kink types .",
    "fig.8c illustrates a double - kinked ellipse of a giraffe type observed from the side in a thick ( @xmath75 ) 8ocb sample .",
    "the just alluded kinking processes can bring large deviations to darboux s law ; reciprocally it is clear that the deviations from darboux s law mean a modification of the shape of the ideal fcd conics , i.e. the presence of kinks ( at the scale of the layers , since they are not visible with the optical microscope ) and of their attached dislocations .",
    "these dislocations necessarily disperse through the medium , outside and/or inside the fcd .",
    "infinitesimal dislocations , if alone , would result , as stated above , in an extra curvature of the layers ; two cases arise : either the deformed layers keep parallel , hence the layer normal keep straight , and one gets eventually a new ideal fcd , or there is a deviation to straightness of the layer normals , and consequently a layer thickness variation ( this case falls within the province of the kroener s dislocation densities @xcite ) , i.e. a process of high energy if not relaxed , at least in part , by finite edge dislocations .",
    "it suffices then to consider only those latter .",
    "the edge components of the attached dislocations that are dispersed inside the fcd break the parallelism of the inside layers .",
    "the congruence of the layer normals is thus no longer a set of straight lines .",
    "this is another way of explaining the variation to darboux s theorem .",
    "this could have been stated from the start : _ edge dislocation densities break darboux s theorem , because they break the layer parallelism_. but this statement comprehends deviations to darboux s theorem that are more general than those where the focal manifolds are degenerate to lines .",
    "the focal manifolds of a congruence of curved normals are generically 2d surfaces , not lines .",
    "we see that the fact that these surfaces are degenerate into lines comes from the fact that the dislocations in question are _ attached _ to the original focal lines .",
    "to conclude , the occurrence of deviations to darboux s theorem for a set of focal _ lines _ means that the conics are ( densely ) kinked and dislocations attached to those kinks .",
    "+      the shape of the layers is cylindrical about the central zone of the hyperbola , near its apex ( which is also the physical focus of the ellipse ) .",
    "but the layers are practically perpendicular to the hyperbola at a distance of order @xmath13 to the plane of the ellipse ; the wedge disclination smoothly vanishes far from the ellipse plane . in between",
    ", the layers display cusps , the lesser pronounced the more distant from the ellipse .",
    "hyperbolae are lines of easy coalescence of screw dislocations , as observed long ago @xcite .",
    "the presence of kinks on the hyperbola is a delicate matter ; because it is a @xmath40 wedge disclination ( @xmath76 ) , eq . 3 and 4",
    "do not apply directly . a way of solving the question is to consider that the line is made of two @xmath43 lines , indicating that dislocations with total burgers vectors twice as large can attach to a kink of the same size as in the @xmath43 case .",
    "another situation is worth considering . in fragmented focal domains of",
    "the type represented fig.9b ( called _ fragmented _ domains ) , the hyperbola belongs to the boundary of the domain .",
    "it is then no longer a @xmath40 disclination but a @xmath43 disclination , as if it were split all along its length .",
    "such an object , noted sfcd for short , and already recognized by g. friedel @xcite , is easily obtained in a confined sample .",
    "a sfcd is bound by a segment of the ellipse and by a segment of the hyperbola , and four fragments of cones of revolution .",
    "thus both segments are @xmath43 disclination line segments .    as a consequence , sfcds",
    "are generally aligned , attached by the ends of the disclination segments , such attachments being required by the conservation of the disclination strength . but observe that a hyperbola h ( resp .",
    "an ellipse e ) can be attached indifferently either to another h ( resp .",
    "an e ) or to an e ( resp .",
    "one can imagine that the ellipse @xmath77 of a @xmath78 is attached to @xmath79 of a @xmath80 , while the hyperbola @xmath81 of the @xmath78 is attached to @xmath82 of the @xmath80 .",
    "such a set of line segments attached by their extremities is topologically equivalent to a double helix .",
    "this geometry , with sequences of the ... heheh ... type , was observed long ago by c. e. williams @xcite at the n @xmath1 sm transition ; it is at the origin of helical giant screw dislocations .",
    "let us also mention the observation , also reported in @xcite , of a mobile kink ( several microns long ) perpendicular to the @xmath43 hyperbola of a sfcd , moving in the direction of the physical focus , but nucleated far from it , at a distance large compared to @xmath13 .",
    "there is no doubt that dislocations , dragged along the hyperbola , are attached to this mobile kink ; their burgers vectors , that are perpendicular to the layers , are practically parallel to the asymptotic direction of the hyperbola , at a distance from the ellipse plane , which indicates that they are of screw character .",
    "this might be an indication of a mechanism by which screw dislocations align along a ( split ) hyperbola .",
    "+      fcd s that are immersed in the bulk ( they are of the type represented fig.9a , and generally gather into tilt boundaries ) disappear rather suddenly about @xmath84 before the transition , by an instability mechanism which certainly implies a sudden multiplication of dislocations .",
    "the capture of free edge dislocations by the ellipse modifies its geometric features @xmath15 and @xmath13 , fig.10 .",
    "free dislocations of the same ( resp .",
    "opposite ) sign as the dislocations attached to the ellipse , if captured , would increase ( resp .",
    "decrease ) its size ( @xmath85 ) , either at @xmath15 constant ( then the asymptotic directions stay constant ) , or not .",
    "boundary conditions play a dominant role in this relaxation process . notice that , after a possible increase in size , the ellipses eventually always decrease in size when the temperature increases , the smallest ellipses disappearing first . for the ellipses belonging to a grain boundary",
    ", this implies that the boundary area occupied by dislocations ( the so - called residual boundary ) increases with temperature .",
    "this is in agreement with the model developed in @xcite , which relates the residual boundary to the material constants ; in particular a decrease of the compression modulus @xmath3 must result in an increase of the residual area .",
    "another important issue here is the existence of the instability .",
    "both topics will be discussed in more details in a forthcoming publication .",
    "this paper investigates from a theoretical point of view some features of the fcd transformations that have been observed , in the smectic phase , when approaching the nematic phase .",
    "these very spectacular phenomena happen in a large temperature domain ( @xmath86 half a degree in 8cb , which is the chemical we used for quantitative observations ; the other compounds yield qualitatively equivalent results ) in which it is believed that the variations of the material constant @xmath3 are large enough to allow significant variations of the dislocation line energy and the multiplication of fresh dislocations . at the same time @xmath4 and also @xmath11 ( as we assume ) do not vary in comparable proportion , so that the energy of focal conic domains is not appreciably changed .",
    "we have tried to discuss the general principles at the origin of these transformations that are due to the direct interaction between fcds and finite burgers vector dislocations .",
    "there is no doubt that infinitesimally small burgers vector dislocations are also playing a role , in particular in the phenomena of viscous relaxation @xcite , but this is not discussed .",
    "the general principles that we advance are geometrical and topological in essence .",
    "the mechanisms that obey these principles seem to be plenty , depending in particular on the boundary conditions and the precise fcd texture .",
    "the examples we have given are few , and are chosen for the sake of illustration .",
    "a description of several more observed transformations , interpreted in the same terms , will be given somewhere else .",
    "the sma @xmath1 n transition is one of the most debated liquid crystal phase transitions @xcite .",
    "this is not the place to enter into the detail of this debate , inasmuch as our results , even if they stress the importance of defect interplays in the critical region , are not directly related to the very proximity of the transition , which has been examined by several authors with great accuracy ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the question which is at stake is rather why the interactions occur at temperatures definitively lower than @xmath25 .",
    "we interpret this phenomenon as an instability for the multiplication of dislocations , much akin to a kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite under temperature , but also under stress ( the boundary conditions ) , of the sort proposed in @xcite for a completely different type of transition .",

    "consequently in the generic case @xmath45(0 , @xmath91 has a very large core singularity , thus large accompanying stresses and a large core energy . on the other hand the cut surface displacement vanishes at @xmath90 if @xmath39 is attached to @xmath45 at @xmath90 , but",
    "then it does not vanish at @xmath92 .",
    "there is still a large core singularity along @xmath45 , except at @xmath90 .",
    "the volterra process , when applied in its standard form , does not provide a solution to the construction of a curved disclination with well relaxed stresses .",
    "an extended conception of the volterra process solves the problem .",
    "assume that there is a copy of the rotation vector @xmath39 attached to all the points of @xmath45 , and consider the effect of such on a point @xmath87 belonging to the cut surface of all these @xmath93 .",
    "we have , for each other @xmath90 belonging to @xmath45 , another value of the relative displacement of the lips of the cut surface : + @xmath94 this difficulty is easily solved by the introduction of a set of _ infinitesimal _ dislocations attached to the disclination line all along ( fig.12 ) .",
