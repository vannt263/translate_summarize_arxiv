    "the study of superconducting samples with sizes comparable to the penetration depth @xmath0 and the coherence length @xmath1 became possible due to recent progress in nanofabrication technologies . this evolution resulted in an increase of interest in the investigation of flux penetration and flux expulsion in such mesoscopic samples in order to explain the hysteresis behavior and the different phase transitions in thin superconducting samples @xcite .",
    "it is well known that for type - ii @xmath2 superconductors the triangular abrikosov vortex lattice is energetically favored in the magnetic field range @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) parameter , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the first and second critical fields of a type - ii superconductor .",
    "since the effective london penetration depth @xmath7 increases considerably in thin films one expects the appearance of the abrikosov multivortex state even in thin type - i @xmath8 superconductors when the thickness @xmath9 .",
    "but , in small confined systems there is a competition between the boundary of the sample , which tries to impose the symmetry of the sample boundary on the vortex configuration , and this triangular abrikosov state . as a consequence , the effective gl parameter @xmath10 is no longer the only controlling parameter which determines the shape of the vortex configuration in thin mesocopic superconducting samples @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical and experimental studies of superconducting disks and rings @xcite found that , as function of the applied field , there are transitions between circular symmetric vortex states ( called giant vortex states ) with different vorticity @xmath11 .",
    "experimentally it was found that the magnetic field at which the transition @xmath12 occurs does not necessarily coincides with the magnetic field @xmath13 where the vorticity of the ground state changes from @xmath11 to @xmath14 , i.e. it is possible to drive the system in a metastable state .",
    "this is typical for first order phase transitions . for increasing applied field ,",
    "the state with vorticity @xmath11 remains stable up to the penetration field @xmath15 and transits then to the superconducting state with vorticity @xmath14 . for decreasing applied field ,",
    "the state with vorticity @xmath14 remains stable down to the expulsion field @xmath16 before going to the state with vorticity @xmath11 .",
    "this hysteresis effect is a consequence of the presence of an energy barrier between the states with vorticity @xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "the latter corresponds to different minima of the free energy in configurational space and the lowest barrier between those two minima is a saddle point .",
    "this barrier arises from the fact that the superconducting current around a vortex is in the opposite direction to the screening currents at the surface of the sample @xcite .",
    "this bean - livingston model has been refined to different sample geometries @xcite .",
    "the time of flux penetration and expulsion is determined by the height of the energy barrier .",
    "the experimental consequences of the existence of these metastable states are : ( i ) hysteretic behavior @xcite , ( ii ) paramagnetic meissner effect @xcite , ( iii ) fractional flux penetration @xcite , and ( iv ) negative flux entrance @xcite , i.e. a decrease of the flux penetration through the superconducting disk with increasing vorticity and increasing magnetic field .",
    "schweigert and peeters @xcite studied flux penetration and expulsion in thin superconducting disks and presented an approach to find the saddle point states .",
    "they calculated the height of the free energy barriers which separate the stable states with different vorticity @xmath17 we will extend their approach and present a systematic study of flux penetration and expulsion in thin superconducting disks and disks with a hole in the center , i.e. mesoscopic ring structures .",

    "@xcite  used the nonlinear gl equation to study the phase diagram of a thin - wire loop and a thin film with a circular hole in the limit @xmath18 .",
    "they performed a stability analysis of the giant vortex state with vorticity @xmath11 by allowing only the admixture of the @xmath14 vortex state .",
    "a more rigorous stability analysis was performed by horane _",
    "_ @xcite  who studied the saddle points between two vortex states of a one dimensional wire of zero width .",
    "they allowed for more possible non - uniform perturbations which may make the vortex state unstable .",
    "they found that the transition between two angular momentum states occurs through a saddle point which has a zero in the order parameter at some point along the ring .",
    "such a zero creates a phase slip center , allowing the phase winding required for the transition .",
    "our systems have a non zero radial width and consequently such a scenario is not possible because the order parameter is not allowed to be zero along a radial line .",
    "in fact it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that for a disk geometry , the saddle point for flux penetration corresponds to a state with suppressed superconductivity at the disk edge which acts as a nucleus for the following vortex creation . in the present paper",
    "we will find that for rings with a finite width this picture has to be modified because of the presence of two boundaries , i.e. two edges .",
    "recently , palacios @xcite calculated saddle point states and the energy barriers responsible for the metastabilities of superconducting mesoscopic disks using the lowest landau level approximation .",
    "the central idea of his method was to find generic stationary solutions of the ginzburg - landau functional and to project the order parameter onto smaller subspaces spanned by a finite number @xmath19 of eigenfunctions , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "palacios restricted himself to @xmath22 and therefore his approach is a special case of the one of ref .",
    "@xcite where no such restriction on @xmath19 was imposed and where also different radial states were included .",
    "yampolskii and peeters @xcite investigated the influence of the boundary condition ( surface enhancement ) on the superconducting states and the energy barriers between those vortex states .",
    "they also restricted their calculations to @xmath22 .",
    "recently , akkermans _",
    "et al _ @xcite studied the behavior of metastable vortex states in infinite superconducting cylinders for @xmath23 , i.e. the london regime .",
    "they considered the situation where the vortices are symmetrically distributed along a closed ring and they found structural phase transitions of vortex patterns between the metastable states .",
    "the key concept was the introduction of a special curve @xmath24 , which embodies the main geometric features of a vortex configuration .",
    "this curve appears mathematically as a limit cycle of the system of currents generated by the vortex pattern and separates the paramagnetic and diamagnetic domains .",

    "the typical number of complex components used are in the range @xmath59 .",
    "thus the superconducting state is mapped into a 2d cluster of @xmath60 particles with coordinates @xmath61 whose energy is determined by the hamiltonian ( [ vgl3 ] ) . the energy landscape in this @xmath62 dimensional space",
    "is studied where the local minima and the saddle points between them will be determined together with the corresponding vortex states .    to find the superconducting states and the saddle point states we use the technique described in ref .",

    "we solve numerically the following equation : @xmath74 starting from a randomly choosen initial set of coefficients , we calculate a nearby minimum of the free energy by moving in the direction of the negative free energy gradient @xmath75 .",
    "the set of coefficients of this minimum determines then the ground state or a metastable state .",
    "starting from the initial set of coefficients we can also calculate a nearby saddle point state by moving to a minimum of the free energy in all directions , except the one which has the lowest eigenvalue . in this direction",
    "we move to a local maximum . repeating this procedure for many randomly choosen initial sets of coefficients @xmath63 for fixed magnetic field",
    ", we find the different possible superconducting states and saddle point states . to calculate the magnetic field dependence we start from a superconducting state at a certain field and we change the applied field by small increments . by moving into the direction of the nearest minimum or saddle point",
    ", the corresponding state will be found for the new magnetic field , provided that the field step is small enough .",
    "in the present section we discuss superconducting disks .",
    "although the system is circular symmetric , in general we are not allowed to assume that @xmath76 because of the non - linear term in the gl functional .",
    "nevertheless , in small disks the confinement effects are dominant and this imposes a circular symmetry on the superconducting condensate , which means that only the ` giant ' vortex state , i.e. a circular symmetric vortex state , appears . for larger disks and not too large magnetic fields ,",
    "the confinement effects are no longer dominant and multivortices can nucleate in a certain magnetic field range . for this reason we make a distinction between small and large disks .",
    "we consider superconducting disks with radius @xmath77 .",
