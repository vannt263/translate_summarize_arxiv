    "thermodynamic studies of single phase superconductor samples are most desirable , yet it often proves difficult to synthesize samples which are @xmath15 pure . especially in the initial phase of the discovery of a new superconducting material ,",
    "synthesis methods usually are not as advanced as to synthesize perfect samples . at this stage",
    "a significant amount of a precursor material or a by - product often remains as a second component in the end product .",
    "therefore , much care must be taken when extracting properties of the superconductor to ensure that these are intrinsic .",
    "for meaningful physical statements , intensive quantities need to be evaluated , i.e.  the measured extensive physical quantities need to be given per amount of substance ( a.o.s . ) , per volume , or per mass .",
    "however , since the ratio of the two components is not known , or the second component is considered to contribute marginally , the quantities are usually given per _",
    "total _ a.o.s . , volume , or mass .",
    "values calculated in this way can be significantly off the true value and require a more careful analysis .",
    "the key issue therefore is extracting the fraction of each component present .",
    "when dealing with a superconducting sample containing a second _ metallic _ component , such an analysis is possible and is described here .",
    "integrating the heat capacity to obtain the condensation energy of the superconductor gives a measure for the amount of the superconducting component .",
    "when several samples of different superconducting volume fractions are measured , the condensation energy obtained varies accordingly . from the systematic variation it is possible to specify the properties of the ideal sample .",
    "specific heat measurements on @xmath1  have shown that in the superconducting state a noticeable density of states at the fermi level remains as @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cdivt_vs_t ] ) .",
    "the residual sommerfeld coefficient @xmath17 and normal - state coefficient @xmath18 vary among the various synthesis runs in a way that is a typical signature of the above described situation .",
    "we have therefore developed the appropriate analysis method described below .",
    "@xmath1  is one of only four pyrochlore superconductors known to date , of which three were discovered very recently and belong to the same family .",
    "these are the @xmath19-pyrochlore cd@xmath20re@xmath20o@xmath21 @xcite and the @xmath0-pyrochlores _ _ a__os@xmath20o@xmath22 , where _ a _ = cs , rb , or k @xcite .",
    "the pyrochlores exhibit inherent geometrical frustration due to the metal ions forming a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "thus , metallic pyrochlores constitute ideal systems to study to what degree itinerant electrons are affected by a lattice which is known to cause geometrical frustration for interactions of localized magnetic moments .",
    "as reported previously @xcite , @xmath1  is a conventional s - wave superconductor with a critical temperature @xmath23 .",
    "this analysis was based on specific heat measurements and evidence for s - wave symmetry was also given by penetration depth measurements by @xcite ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . further support for conventional s - wave - type superconductivity in @xmath1  comes from @xmath24rb nmr measurements by @xcite @xcite . here",
    ", we shed new light onto this subject by applying the developed analysis to our data on @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we provide evidence for an additional electronic mass enhancement beyond the contribution from electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this article is divided into two parts : first , the condensation energy analysis is described and appropriate formulas derived . in the second part we apply the analysis to @xmath1  to extract its intrinsic thermodynamic parameters . for illustration purposes",
    ", we frequently refer to the figures pertaining to @xmath1  already in the general section .",
    "finally , we elaborate on some further aspects of the condensation energy analysis in the appendices .",
    "the starting point for our analysis is the experimentally measured extensive heat capacity @xmath25 of a sample . ) to denote quantities in an extensive form .",
    "often , a capital @xmath26 is used to denote ( extensive ) heat capacity , while a small @xmath27 is used to denote ( intensive ) specific heat , i.e.  @xmath28 . for several reasons ,",
    "this notation is not appropriate here .",
    "first , we also use heat capacity per volume and a.o.s .",
    ", for which there is no dedicated symbol .",
    "second , the same difficulty of an extensive / intensive quantity applies to the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath18 , for which there is only one customary symbol .",
    "we therefore feel that a tilde is a more advisable way to distinguish extensive from intensive quantities .",
    "further , the terms `` specific heat '' and `` heat capacity '' are often used interchangeably and we therefore prefer to use the terms intensive / extensive heat capacity instead . ]",
    "we assume that two components contribute to this heat capacity : component _ one _ is the superconductor , while component _ two _ is a normal metal : @xmath29 the fact that the first component becomes superconducting enables us to extract the contribution to the heat capacity from each component by analyzing the condensation energy .",
    "we therefore call this procedure condensation energy analysis ( cea ) .",
    "because the relative contribution of each component is not known a priori , and because a sample dependent extensive heat capacity is not meaningful , an experimenter assumes the contribution @xmath30 of component two to be small and uses the total mass @xmath31 of the sample to convert the heat capacity into an intensive form @xmath32 . in this case , the heat capacity @xmath33 is given in energy per temperature per mass ( typically in @xmath34j / g / k ) .",
    "due to the presence of a second component , this heat capacity is obviously not the correct heat capacity of component one .",
    "usually the total mass of a sample is measured and conversion into an intensive form is performed using this mass .",
    "consequently , in our analysis we will also assume the total mass to be known experimentally .",
    "as will be shown below , this results in the properties of the sample to be linear in the superconducting mass fraction .",
    "the cea not only allows the extraction of the intrinsic properties of the superconducting phase , it also does so without requiring any further knowledge about the second normal metallic component .",
    "we use the presence of varying amounts of this second component to specify the properties of the ideal sample : the heat capacity @xmath35 for the superconductor vanishes for @xmath36 , while the measured residual heat capacity is due to the second , metallic phase only . to a certain extent , it is possible to extract intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the second component as well .",
    "if we can actually identify component two , e.g.  from xrd structure analysis , this extraction is possible to the full extent , as we show in the present example .",
    "the following definitions will prove useful in making formulas more readable : @xmath37 here , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass densities of the two components in mass per volume and @xmath34 is their ratio . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the sommerfeld coefficients of the two components in energy per mass per temperature squared ( typically in @xmath34j / g / k@xmath42 ) and @xmath43 is their ratio .",
    "we further assign @xmath44 to the superconducting volume fraction and @xmath45 to the superconducting mass fraction : @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the volume and mass of component @xmath49 , while @xmath50 and @xmath31 are the total volume and total mass respectively , i.e.  @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the parameters which are readily extracted from specific heat measurements and also published as such are the sommerfeld coefficients of the two - component system @xmath18 and @xmath17 in the normal state and the superconducting state respectively .",
    "we call the sommerfeld coefficient in the superconducting state @xmath17 `` residual '' , because it results from the second component only , since the first one becomes superconducting with a vanishing heat capacity for @xmath53 .",
    "we calculate these as a function of the superconducting mass fraction @xmath45 , which is proportional to the condensation energy @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is the condensation energy of the superconducting component .",
    "@xmath56 for a given sample is readily obtained by integrating the measured specific heat to obtain the entropy difference @xmath57 and then integrating again to obtain @xmath58 here , @xmath59 is the difference in heat capacity between the superconducting and normal state . in the present study",
    ", the normal state is reached by applying an external magnetic field of @xmath60 , which is well above the upper critical field .",
    "the thermodynamic critical field @xmath61 is obtained from the condensation energy by using the relation @xmath62 .    the relations between the intrinsic sommerfeld coefficients of the two components , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the measured sommerfeld coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath17 are most easily obtained from their respective extensive forms :    the residual sommerfeld coefficient @xmath63 measured in @xmath64 is equivalent to the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath65 of the second component ,",
    "since the density of states of the superconducting component is gapped and therefore @xmath66 : @xmath67 from this we get @xmath68 the residual sommerfeld coefficient @xmath17 measured in @xmath64 is a direct measure for the presence of the second component .",
    "it is easily seen that the @xmath69-intercept of a @xmath17 vs @xmath45 plot is equal to @xmath41 and that @xmath17 vanishes at @xmath70 and thus defines @xmath15 superconducting volume or mass fraction .    to calculate @xmath18 we equate @xmath71 resulting in @xmath72 which also depends linearly on the superconducting mass fraction  @xmath45 .",
    "thus , from @xmath18 vs @xmath45 , we get a second , independent plot to extract @xmath41 by noting the @xmath69-intercept .",
    "having located the ideal sample through @xmath17 , the intrinsic sommerfeld coefficient of component one , @xmath40 , can immediately be extracted by taking the value of @xmath18 at @xmath70 .",
    "the superconducting electronic specific heat @xmath73 is extracted in the usual way by subtracting the specific heat at @xmath64 from the normal state specific heat at @xmath60 but paying attention to the appropriate masses : @xmath74 here , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are the total heat capacity of both components from the respective source .",
    "@xmath77 describes any field - induced heat capacity , be it from fluctuations or from a magnetization of the material .",
    "taking the difference and assuming any magnetic heat capacity @xmath77 to be negligible , we get @xmath78 we conclude that the specific heat difference @xmath79 needs to be scaled with the inverse superconducting mass fraction  to extract the true electronic superconducting specific heat . also , the added electronic specific heat from the normal state , @xmath80 , has to be calculated using the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath40 of the pure superconductor .",
    "for an ideal sample with @xmath70 ,",
    "( [ eqn : ces ] ) is , of course , equivalent to the usual @xmath81 . as figure",
    "[ fig : ces_vs_tdivtc ] shows for @xmath1 , the electronic superconducting specific heat indeed shows a universal behavior when scaled appropriately according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ces ] ) .    at low temperatures , where @xmath82 , we can approximate @xmath79 using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ces ] ) and get @xmath83 that is , @xmath79 is linear in @xmath84 and the slope is proportional to @xmath45 , varying from sample to sample .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltac_vs_t ] for @xmath1 .",
    "evidently , the negative of the mentioned slope plotted against the superconducting mass fraction  has the value @xmath40 at @xmath85 . @xmath79",
    "thus provides another way of extracting the true sommerfeld coefficient of component one from the data which is independent from @xmath18 vs @xmath45 .",
    "it further provides an additional consistency check since this curve and @xmath18 vs @xmath45 need to cross at the same @xmath45 value as @xmath17 vs @xmath45 vanishes ( namely at @xmath70 ) .    if the assumptions on the composition of the samples leading to the cea are correct , then the specific heat jump at @xmath86 is proportional to the condensation energy : @xmath87 here , @xmath88 is a constant of proportionality thermodynamically related to the critical field by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dhc_dt ] ) .",
    "as the analysis shows , the relevant parameter when measuring the total mass of a sample experimentally is the superconducting mass fraction @xmath45 .",
    "all the relevant properties are linear in the mass fraction and therefore in the condensation energy , which can be readily extracted from specific heat measurements by integration .",
    "the reason for this is that the total mass @xmath31 of the sample is used for the conversion from extensive into intensive form , not the volume or the a.o.s . in the case where another sample property is measured ,",
    "the analysis remains analogous , but the parameters are linear in the corresponding superconducting fraction instead of the superconducting mass fraction . these variations are discussed in more detail in the appendix .",
    "we would like to mention , that though in principle still possible , performing the cea would be more difficult when dealing with a nodal superconductor . in this case",
    "the superconducting heat capacity goes to zero not exponentially , but following a power - law . as a consequence ,",
    "there is still some contribution from the superconductor to @xmath17 at all but the very lowest temperatures .",
    "the same argument holds for the analysis of the slope of @xmath79 vs @xmath84 ( eq .  [ eqn : deltac ] ) .",
    "the cea would still work fine , but data to even lower temperatures might be needed .    plotting the data as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bruhwilerplot ] ( here for @xmath1 ) allows @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath89 to be extracted at a glance . at the same time , the plot serves as a check for the consistency of the analysis , since it is immediately apparent if the lines cross each other and the @xmath90- and @xmath69-axes at the correct points : @xmath17 needs to vanish at the same @xmath45 value as @xmath18 vs @xmath45 and the slope of @xmath91 vs @xmath45 cross . also , the @xmath69-intercepts of @xmath18 vs @xmath45 and @xmath17 vs @xmath45 need to be the same .",
    "we would like to comment on the necessity to pinpoint @xmath85 for the extraction of the intrinsic parameters . in this study",
    "we accomplish this by extrapolating @xmath17 to zero which is possible because the second component is metallic and thus has a non - vanishing @xmath41 .",
    "it is conceivable that @xmath85 could also be pinpointed using some other technique .",

    "@xmath88 is always independent of @xmath45 since it is the proportionality factor between @xmath94 and @xmath56 .",
    "if the true condensation energy @xmath89 is to be extracted , we need to locate @xmath95 in any case .",

[ tab : affected_param ] ) and @xmath88 are related thermodynamically , also @xmath96 can be determined independently of @xmath85 . in the case where @xmath93 , it follows that @xmath97 and thus @xmath98 rendering @xmath99 independent of @xmath45 .",
