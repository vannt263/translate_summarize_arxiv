    "two main features emerge from the comparison of gp with npse : ( i ) the left border of the energetically and dynamically unstable regions are very similar in the two cases , which also implies a a good agreement for the critical quasimomenta @xmath107 and @xmath87 ; ( ii ) for small values of @xmath31 the shape of the dynamically unstable region above threshold looks rather different .",

    "these results confirm that the npse can be used as an efficient model to quantitatively identify the onset of instability for a wide range of @xmath31 , relevant for available experiments @xcite .",
    "the reason for its accuracy in predicting the thresholds is simply that the critical quasimomenta @xmath107 and @xmath87 are determined by the behavior of the @xmath66 branch of excitations with no radial nodes . a comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig : spectragp ] and [ fig : spectranpse ] shows that these modes are indeed very accurately described by the npse up to the instability threshold .",
    "a closer inspection of the stability diagrams shows a difference in the shape and size of the dynamically unstable region at small @xmath31 .",
    "the one predicted by npse does not fill the whole region above threshold .",
    "this agrees with previous 1d models @xcite , but disagrees with the predictions of 3d gp equation .",
    "this disagreement can be easily understood by looking at the role played by the transverse degrees of freedom . in the npse , which only accounts for @xmath66 modes , nonvanishing complex frequencies appear when phonons and antiphonons couple , collapsing onto a single dispersion law . for a given @xmath33 ,",
    "this provides a range of @xmath37 for unstable modes , which starts first at @xmath108 and then lowers towards @xmath109 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectranpse ] ) .",
    "however , at high enough @xmath33 , the dispersion of the phonon - antiphonon pair splits again into two separate curves and this gives a window of stable modes from a certain @xmath37 ( at fixed @xmath33 ) up to zone boundary .",
    "this window is the dynamically stable region on the top - right corner of the npse stability diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] .",
    "now , by looking at the gp spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectragp ] , one can easily understand why these stable regions are absent in the gp stability diagrams .",
    "the @xmath66 modes in this case are mixed up with several @xmath110 branches and these radial modes can be unstable also in the range of @xmath37 where the @xmath66 modes are stable .",
    "it is worth stressing that the occurrence of complex frequencies for such radial excitations also implies that , once the system is brought into the unstable region above @xmath87 , it can easily develop macroscopic motions with a nontrivial radial dynamics .    finally , it is interesting to compare the predictions of gp and npse for the growth rate , @xmath111 , of the most dynamically unstable modes .",

    "indeed two interesting questions have been raised : ( i ) whether the gp equation is suitable to describe the phenomenology observed in the experiment , and ( ii ) whether the observed breakdown of superfluid flow comes from energetic and/or dynamical instability .    to model the lens experiment @xcite , we consider an elongated @xmath112 condensate with @xmath113 atoms confined in an axially symmetric harmonic trap of frequencies @xmath114",

    "<S> the occurrence of energetic and dynamical instabilities in a bose - einstein condensate moving in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice is analyzed by means of the gross - pitaevskii theory . </S>",
    "<S> results of full 3d calculations are compared with those of an effective 1d model , the nonpolynomial schrdinger equation , pointing out the role played by transverse degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the instability thresholds are shown to be scarcely affected by transverse excitations , so that they can be accurately predicted by effective 1d models . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , transverse excitations turn out to be important in characterizing the stability diagram and the occurrence of a complex radial dynamics above the threshold for dynamical instability . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis provides a realistic framework to discuss the dissipative dynamics observed in recent experiments . </S>"
