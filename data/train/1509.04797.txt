    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols are designed to allow two users , alice ( @xmath0 ) and bob ( @xmath1 ) , to establish a shared secret key , secure against even an all - powerful adversary eve ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "since the creation , in 1984 , of the bb84 protocol @xcite , there have been several protocols developed which achieve this end . for a general survey ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "semi - quantum key distribution ( sqkd ) protocols , first introduced in 2007 by boyer et al . ,",
    "@xcite , have the same goal : the establishment of a secret key , secure against an all - powerful adversary .",
    "however now , instead of allowing both @xmath0 and @xmath1 to manipulate quantum resources ( e.g. , prepare and measure qubits in a variety of bases ) as is permissible in a typical qkd protocol , only @xmath0 is allowed such liberties while @xmath1 is limited to performing certain `` classical '' or `` semi - quantum '' operations ( what operations @xmath1 is limited to are discussed shortly ) . in this scenario , @xmath0 is called the _ quantum user _ while @xmath1 is called the _ classical user _ ( in a fully quantum protocol , such as bb84@xcite , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are fully quantum ) .",
    "such protocols are theoretically interesting as they attempt to answer the question `` how quantum does a protocol need to be in order to gain an advantage over a classical one ? ''",
    "@xcite    these sqkd protocols , by necessity , rely on a two - way quantum communication channel - one which permits a qubit to travel from the quantum user @xmath0 , to the classical user @xmath1 , then back to @xmath0 .",
    "the limited classical @xmath1 , upon receiving a qubit , is able to do one of two things : he may _ measure and resend _ the qubit or _ reflect _ the qubit . measuring and resending involves",
    "taking the qubit received from @xmath0 and subjecting it to a @xmath3 basis measurement ( the @xmath3 basis being @xmath4 ) .",
    "his result @xmath5 , for @xmath6 is then resent to @xmath0 . reflecting",
    "the qubit involves @xmath1 allowing the qubit to simply pass through his lab undistributed in which case he learns nothing about its state .",
    "thus , the classical user is only able to work directly with the computational @xmath3 basis - he can not , for example , perform a measurement in the hadamard @xmath7 basis ( denoted @xmath8 ) .",
    "this two - way quantum channel , of course , greatly complicates the security analysis of these protocols as the attacker @xmath2 is allowed two opportunities to interact with the traveling qubit .",
    "while several sqkd protocols have been proposed @xcite , up until recently , the bulk of security proofs for such semi - quantum protocols have focused on the notion of _",
    "robustness_. this property , introduced in @xcite , requires that any attack which causes @xmath2 to potentially gain information , by necessity causes a disturbance which @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with non - zero probability , may detect .",
    "note that robustness says nothing about the amount of information gained ( which may be high ) nor the probability of detection ( which may be low ) .",
    "recently , some work has been accomplished moving beyond robustness . in particular",
    "@xcite derived expressions relating the disturbance of @xmath2 s attack to her information gain for the sqkd protocol of @xcite , assuming she is limited to performing _",
    "individual attacks _ ( those attacks where @xmath2 is limited to performing the same attack operation each iteration of the protocol and is forced to measure her quantum memory before @xmath0 and @xmath1 utilize their key for any purpose - these are weaker attacks than _ collective attacks _ - where @xmath2 performs the same operation each iteration but can postpone her measurement until any future time of her choice - and _ general attacks _ - those attacks where @xmath2 is allowed to do anything within the laws of physics ; the reader is referred to @xcite for more information on these possible attack models ) .",
    "also , @xcite described a new sqkd protocol and computed a similar relation between the disturbance and information gain of @xmath2 s attack , though again assuming individual attacks .",
    "our work recently has been in the proof of unconditional security ( making no assumptions on the type of attack @xmath2 uses ) of several sqkd protocols .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , we proved the security of boyer et al .",
    ", s original sqkd protocol @xcite showing that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are able to distill a secure secret key so long as the noise in the channel is less than @xmath9 .",
    "we have also , in @xcite , derived a series of security results for single state sqkd protocols ( single state protocols were introduced in @xcite , though without proofs of unconditional security ) .",
    "while that particular work stopped short of unconditional security proofs , the security results we prove there can be applied toward that goal @xcite .",
    "finally , and also the topic of this current paper , in @xcite , we designed a new _ mediated sqkd _ protocol .",
    "such a protocol allows two limited classical users @xmath0 and @xmath1 to establish a secure secret key with the help of a quantum server ( denoted @xmath10 for `` center '' ) . with such a system",
    ", one could envision a qkd infrastructure consisting of several limited `` classical '' users , utilizing the services of this quantum server in order to distill secret keys ( each key known only to a pair of classical users , not the server ) .",
    "if the quantum server @xmath10 were honest , such a goal would be trivial .",
    "instead , we assumed the server is untrusted - indeed , we can assume the server is the all - powerful quantum adversary .    in our original work in @xcite",
    ", we proved our mediated protocol s unconditional security by computing a lower bound on its key rate ( to be defined shortly , roughly speaking , the key rate is the ratio of the number of secret key bits to the number of qubits sent ) in the asymptotic scenario ( as the number of qubits sent approaches infinity ) .",
    "we showed that , if the server is `` semi - honest , '' that is the server follows our protocol correctly but afterwards tries to learn something about the key , then @xmath0 and @xmath1 may distill a secret key so long as the noise in the channel is less than @xmath11 .",
    "if the server is fully adversarial ( that is , the server does not follow the protocol and instead performs any operations he likes within the laws of quantum physics ) , then @xmath0 and @xmath1 may distill a secret key so long as the noise in the channel is less than @xmath12 ( a number that is close to bb84 s @xmath13 @xcite ) .    in this paper , we reconsider our security proof and improve on these tolerated noise levels by computing a new bound on the protocol s key rate using an alternative method of proof . in our original proof , we utilized a bound on the jensen - shannon divergence from @xcite to find bounds on the quantum mutual information between @xmath0 and @xmath10 s system . here",
    ", we will use a technique adapted from @xcite ( which we also successfully applied in our proof of security for a different sqkd protocol in @xcite ) which allows us to bound the conditional von neumann entropy between @xmath0 and @xmath10 s system .",
    "this new technique provides a far more optimistic bound .",
    "indeed , as we will see , if the server is semi - honest , using our new key rate bound in this paper , we will see that @xmath0 and @xmath1 may distill a secret key so long as the noise in the quantum channel is less than @xmath14 . if the server @xmath10 is adversarial , then we can withstand up to @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , our new proof of security does not make any assumptions concerning the symmetry of @xmath2 s attack as was done in our original proof .",
    "thus the contributions of this paper are two - fold .",
    "first , we improve our original security proof finding a more optimistic bound on our mediated sqkd protocol s tolerated noise level .",
    "our new proof in this paper also requires fewer assumptions .",
    "secondly , we describe an alternative proof method , which as we ve already shown in @xcite , can be applied to other semi - quantum protocols ( and perhaps other qkd protocols utilizing a two - way channel ) . we also show how this alternative method can produce more optimistic bounds than produced by bounding the jensen - shannon divergence as done in our original proof @xcite .",
    "thus , this observation can be useful in other qkd protocol proofs and , perhaps , may lead to insight into various quantum information theoretic bounds .",
    "furthermore , it may be possible to adapt the techniques we use in this proof to work with other qkd protocols which utilize a two - way quantum communication channel .",
    "we now review the mediated protocol of @xcite . this protocol is designed to allow two classical users @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( users who can only measure and resend in the @xmath3 basis or reflect qubits ) to distill a secret key , known only to themselves , with the help of a quantum server @xmath10 .",
    "note that , since @xmath0 and @xmath1 can only make @xmath3 basis measurements , they must rely on the server to perform measurements in alternative bases .",
    "however , neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1 trust @xmath10 ; indeed we will prove the security of this protocol assuming @xmath10 is adversarial .",
    "since this paper is concerned only with devising an improved key rate bound , we do not alter the protocol in any way .",
    "this mediated protocol assumes the existence of a quantum communication channel connecting alice ( @xmath0 ) to the server @xmath10 and bob ( @xmath1 ) to @xmath10 .",
    "we do not require a quantum channel directly connecting @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "besides this , we assume an authenticated classical channel connects @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the server @xmath10 , and indeed any other third party eavesdropper , may listen to the messages sent on this channel , but they may not send messages of their own . finally , we assume a classical channel connects the server to either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( or both )",
    ". see figure [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "using similar arguments as in @xcite , this channel connecting @xmath10 to @xmath0 or @xmath1 need not be authenticated ; though , indeed , better security bounds may be achieved if it is authenticated as we discuss later .",
    "we will assume that any message sent from @xmath10 is received by both parties .",
    "that is , @xmath10 can not send two different messages @xmath16 to @xmath0 , respectively @xmath1 , without being caught .",
    "such a mechanism is easy to achieve : any message sent from @xmath10 to @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) is then forwarded by @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) to the other honest party @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) using the authenticated channel .     and",
    "@xmath1 are the honest , classical users who wish to establish a secret key ; @xmath2 is a third party eavesdropper ; and @xmath10 is the untrusted , potentially adversarial quantum server .",
    "a quantum channel ( the parallel lines in the center of the diagram ) connects @xmath10 to @xmath0 and also @xmath10 to @xmath1 ; these channels pass through the third party eavesdropper ( which may be a single entity or two separate entities ) .",
    "an authenticated classical channel connects @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( the dotted line ) ; only @xmath0 and @xmath1 may write to this channel , however all parties can read from it . finally a classical channel connects the server @xmath10 to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; this channel is not necessarily authenticated and the eavesdroppers may write their own messages on it . ]",
    "our protocol will utilize the bell basis , the states of which we denote : @xmath17    we first describe the protocol assuming an honest server @xmath10 .",
    "the quantum communication stage of our protocol repeats the following process :    1 .",
    "@xmath10 prepares @xmath18 , sending one qubit to @xmath0 , the other to @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the classical users ) choose , independently of each other , to either reflect the qubit back to @xmath10 or to measure and resend it .",
    "if they measure in the @xmath3 basis and resend , they save their measurement results as their potential raw key bit .",
    "however , @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not yet reveal their choice of operation .",
    "3 .   regardless of @xmath0 and @xmath1 s choice",
    ", @xmath10 will receive two qubits back from them .",
    "@xmath10 then performs a bell measurement .",
    "if this measurement produces the result @xmath19 , @xmath10 sends the message `` @xmath20 '' to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the classical channel .",
    "otherwise , for all other measurement results , @xmath10 sends the message `` @xmath21 '' .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 now divulge , using the authenticated classical channel , their choice in step 2 ( but not their measurement results ) .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 both measure and resent , and if @xmath10 sends the message `` @xmath20 '' , they will _ accept _ this iteration ; that is to say , they will both use this iteration s measurement results to contribute towards their raw key .",
    "they will not accept this iteration ( i.e. , it will not be used to contribute to the raw key ) if @xmath10 sent the message `` @xmath21 '' .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 both reflected , it should be the case that @xmath10 sends `` @xmath21 '' ; any other message by @xmath10 is counted as an error .",
    "all other cases are discarded .",
    "assuming an honest @xmath10 and the lack of any channel noise or third - party eavesdropper , it is clear that the above protocol is correct ( i.e. , @xmath0 and @xmath1 will agree on the same raw key ) . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 both reflect , the state arriving back to @xmath10 on step 3 is @xmath18 ; thus @xmath10 should always respond with the message `` @xmath21 '' . alternatively , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 both measure and resend , the state arriving at @xmath10 is @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is @xmath0 and @xmath1 s measurement result and potential raw key bit for this iteration ) .",
    "@xmath10 will then perform a bell basis measurement ( projecting the state into one of the bell basis states ) .",
    "this measurement results in outcome @xmath18 or @xmath19 each with probability @xmath24 .",
    "only if @xmath10 reports `` @xmath20 '' ( i.e. , he measures @xmath19 ) will @xmath0 and @xmath1 use their measurement results `` @xmath25 '' as their raw key bit .",
    "( note that if they also use those iterations where @xmath10 sends `` @xmath21 '' , this opens a potential easy attack strategy for @xmath10 : he can always measure in the computational basis and send `` @xmath21 '' each iteration . )",
    "let @xmath26 be the probability that @xmath0 or @xmath1 measure and resend .",
    "note that , without noise and assuming an honest @xmath10 , only @xmath27 iterations are expected to be accepted .",
    "however , to improve efficiency , we may use a technique from @xcite ( which was meant to improve the key rate of the bb84 protocol ) .",
    "namely , we may set @xmath26 arbitrarily close to 1 .",
    "thus , in the asymptotic scenario , we can expect @xmath24 of the qubits sent to contribute to the raw key .",
    "it is an open question as to whether or not a mediated sqkd protocol can be designed which improves this rate to something larger than @xmath24 .",
    "while this protocol s unconditional security was proven in @xcite , we will now provide an alternative proof of security which , as we demonstrate later , provides a more optimistic lower bound on the protocol s key rate ( we will define the key rate in the asymptotic scenario shortly ) . note that , to prove the security of this protocol , we must not only consider an adversarial @xmath10 , but also the existence of third - party , all - powerful eavesdroppers ( as shown in figure [ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "our proof will work in stages : we will first prove security against an adversarial @xmath10 , assuming @xmath10 is limited to collective attacks ( those where he performs the same attack operation each iteration , but , unlike with an independent attack discussed earlier , he is free to postpone the measurement of his quantum memory until any future time of his choice ) and assuming there are no third - party eavesdroppers .",
    "following this , we will prove security against general attacks ( those attacks where no assumptions are made other than @xmath10 follows the laws of physics ) and assuming the existence of third - party eavesdroppers .",
    "we denote by @xmath28 the shannon entropy function . given a set @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , then :",
    "@xmath32 where all logarithms in this paper are base two unless otherwise specified .",
    "we will occasionally use the notational shortcut @xmath33 to mean @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath35 ( which forces @xmath36 ) , we will occasionally write @xmath37 to mean @xmath38 .    given a density operator @xmath39 , we write @xmath40 to be its von neumann entropy .",
    "let @xmath41 be the eigenvalues of finite dimensional @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath42 .    when @xmath39 acts on a bipartite system @xmath43 , we will often write @xmath44 . then , later , if we write @xmath45 we take that to mean the result of tracing out the @xmath46 portion of @xmath44 ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) . similarly for @xmath48 . similarly , for multi - partite systems ( e.g. , @xmath49 acts on a tripartite system and @xmath50 ) .",
    "given @xmath44 , we write @xmath51 to mean @xmath52 and @xmath53 to mean @xmath54 .",
    "finally , we write @xmath55 to be the conditional von neumann entropy defined : @xmath56 .      for now , we will consider only an adversarial center @xmath10 and not third - party eavesdroppers .",
    "that is , the system in question consists only of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath10 and no one else ( the case when there are third - party attackers will be considered later ) .",
    "we will also assume @xmath10 employs collective attacks .",
    "assuming this , a single iteration of our protocol may be described as a closed system in the hilbert space : @xmath57 where :    * @xmath58 and @xmath46 are @xmath0 and @xmath1 s private registers storing their raw key bit . *",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 are two dimensional spaces modeling the qubit channel connecting @xmath10 to @xmath0 and @xmath10 to @xmath1 respectively ( they are the _ transit _ space ) . * @xmath61 is @xmath10 s private quantum system .",
    "* @xmath62 is a two - dimensional subspace , spanned by orthonormal basis @xmath63 used to model the classical message @xmath10 sends on this iteration .",
    "we model the protocol in the same way as in @xcite , the details of which we now quickly review . at start , @xmath10 , who we now assume is fully adversarial , prepares , not necessarily @xmath18 as prescribed by the protocol , but instead the state @xmath64 where the @xmath65 are arbitrary normalized , though not necessarily orthogonal , states in @xmath61 .",
    "as shown in our original proof , there is no advantage to @xmath10 in sending the above state , versus sending the far simpler state : @xmath66 .",
    "that is , there is no advantage to @xmath10 in preparing a state , on step ( 1 ) of the protocol , that is entangled with his private quantum memory .",
    "the proof of this , which may be found in @xcite , uses a technique introduced in @xcite .",
    "thus , when analyzing the security of this protocol , we may assume the state @xmath10 sends is unentangled with @xmath61 .",
    "following @xmath0 and @xmath1 s operation ( either measuring and resending , or reflecting ) , the qubits return to @xmath10 .",
    "the server , @xmath10 , is now permitted to perform any operation of his choice , potentially entangling the qubits with his private quantum memory .",
    "since he must also send a single classical bit to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( from our earlier discussion , it is impossible for @xmath10 to send different messages to @xmath0 and @xmath1 thus we may assume he sends only a single message and it is received by both ) , his attack is modeled as a _ quantum instrument _",
    "@xcite @xmath67 which acts on density operator @xmath68 as follows : @xmath69 where the @xmath70 satisfy : @xmath71 ( above , @xmath72 is the identity operator . )    we may assume , without loss of generality that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are both finite . finally , it can be shown ( see @xcite for details ) that this attack may be represented , without loss of power to @xmath10 , by a unitary operator @xmath75 acting on a larger , though still finite dimensional , hilbert space . providing @xmath10 with this",
    "larger space potentially increases his power , thus providing us with a lower bound on the security of our protocol . working with unitary attack operators turns out to be far simpler than working with attacks of the form in equation [ eq : instrument ] .    this unitary attack operator , @xmath76 , acts on @xmath77 , where @xmath61 has been suitably expanded .",
    "after @xmath0 and @xmath1 s operation , @xmath10 will apply unitary @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath10 will then perform a projective measurement on the @xmath62 system in the @xmath63 basis .",
    "this measurement determines the message he sends .",
    "the post - measurement state represents the state of his ancilla in the event he sends that particular message .",
    "such a procedure is mathematically equivalent to his use of @xmath67 as proven in @xcite .",
    "clearly , a single iteration of the protocol , conditioning on the event the iteration is accepted ( i.e. , @xmath0 and @xmath1 both measure and resend , and @xmath10 sends `` @xmath20 '' ) may be described by a density operator of the form : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the probability that @xmath0 and @xmath1 s raw key bit is @xmath25 and @xmath80 respectively and @xmath81 is the state of @xmath10 s quantum memory in that event .",
    "following @xmath82 iterations of the quantum communication stage , assuming collective attacks , the overall system is in the state @xmath83 . @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "will then perform parameter estimation , error correction , and privacy amplification protocols ( see @xcite for more information on these , now standard , processes ) resulting in a secret key of size @xmath84 ( possibly @xmath85 if @xmath10 has too much information on the raw key ) .",
    "we are interested in the ratio of secret key bits to raw key bits as the latter approaches infinity ; that is , we are interested in the _ key rate _ , denoted @xmath86 , in the _ asymptotic scenario _",
    "@xcite : @xmath87    for a state of the form @xmath88 , it was shown in @xcite that the key rate is : @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the ( classical ) mutual information held between @xmath0 and @xmath1 s system ; @xmath91 is the quantum mutual information between @xmath0 and @xmath10 ; the conditional entropy @xmath92 was defined earlier in the notation section ; @xmath93 is the conditional shannon entropy defined : @xmath94 .",
    "finally , the infimum is over all attack operators which induce the observed statistics ( e.g. , the observed error rate ) .",
    "note that the first equation , involving mutual information , is due to @xcite , the second , equivalent version , is from @xcite ( showing the two are equal is trivial ) .",
    "while in our previous paper @xcite , we used the key rate equation based on mutual information , in this paper we will bound @xmath86 by bounding the conditional entropy .",
    "though these two equations produce equal results , the technique we use to bound the latter , as we show in this paper , allows us to provide a more optimistic lower bound on @xmath86 .",
    "we must now describe the state of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath10 s system after a single iteration of the protocol , conditioning on the event that this iteration is used to contribute towards the raw key ( i.e. , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 measure and resend , and @xmath10 sends `` @xmath20 '' ) .",

    "we write @xmath76 s action on basis states as follows :    @xmath99    where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are arbitrary , not necessarily normalized nor orthogonal , states in @xmath102 .",
    "unitarity of @xmath76 imposes various restrictions on these states which will become important later in our analysis .",

    ". in particular , if they bound @xmath191 , then , for @xmath192 small enough ( and recall it should be small since @xmath10 is supposed to send `` @xmath21 '' if he receives @xmath18 ) , it holds that : @xmath193 ( we see that @xmath192 must be small enough so that the right hand side of the second inequality is negative . )    both of these two identities will be useful in the subsequent examples where we bound @xmath192 as a function of @xmath194 - the probability that @xmath0 and @xmath1 s measurement results differ - and @xmath195 - the probability that @xmath10 sends the wrong message when @xmath0 and @xmath1 both reflect ( i.e. , he sends `` @xmath20 '' ) ; with @xmath196 implying @xmath197 .      in this first example , we will consider the case where @xmath10 is _ semi - honest _ - that is , he always follows the protocol exactly , preparing the correct state in step one of the protocol , performing the correct measurement in step three , and reporting , honestly , his measurement result . beyond that",
    ", however , he is free to do whatever he likes , for instance , he can listen in on the public communication channel to try and gain additional information on the key .",
    "this is not only a practically relevant scenario to analyze , but it also allows us to compare our new key rate bound with our old from @xcite .    besides the semi - honest sever , we will also assume a noisy quantum channeled modeled using two independent depolarization channels , one for the forward direction ( qubits traveling from @xmath10 to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) with parameter @xmath198 , the other for the reverse ( qubits returning from @xmath0 and @xmath1 to @xmath10 ) with parameter @xmath199 .",

    "now , we assume the server @xmath10 is adversarial .",
    "he is allowed to prepare any state he likes on step ( 1 ) of the protocol , and he may perform any arbitrary operation ( allowed by the laws of quantum physics ) when the qubits return to him , sending any message of his choice based on his operation . the only assumption we make in this section is that @xmath10 s attack is symmetric in that it can be parameterized by only a few parameters ( to be discussed ) .",
    "we make this assumption first , so that we can compare our new key rate bound with our old one from @xcite ( which assumed a symmetric attack ) ; and second , so that we can better visualize the key rate bound by reducing the many parameters to only a few .",

    ", however , we made no such assumptions - equation [ eq : key - rate - bound ] works even in the most general case .",
    "so , while assuming a symmetric attack is not required for our new proof in this paper , it is easier to visualize our key rate bound and it also allows us to compare our new results with our old .",

    "our new proof also does not make any assumptions about the attack used by @xmath10 . note that , while we only evaluated our key rate bound in two specific examples - the semi - honest case and the symmetric adversarial case - our proof works in even the most general of scenarios ( i.e. , a non - symmetric adversarial attack ) .",
    "our work in this paper has shown that this mediated sqkd protocol can tolerate noise levels surpassing the maximal tolerated noise thresholds of many other fully quantum protocols .",

    "many open problems remain .",
    "most important , perhaps , is that we considered only the perfect qubit scenario ; dealing with problems such as multi - photon attacks is an interesting area of research ( in any two - way quantum protocol ) .",
    "also , can a mediated sqkd protocol be designed that is more efficient - recall that , in the absence of noise and with an honest server , only half of the sent qubits can contribute to the raw key .",
    "finally , can a mediated sqkd protocol be designed without the need for @xmath10 to prepare and measure in the bell basis .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the answer to this seems to be positive , however the security proof is more involved .",
