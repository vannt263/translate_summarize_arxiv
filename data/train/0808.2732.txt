    "in the last years , the field of atomic , molecular and optical physics has witnessed an impressive advance in the development of setups to trap atoms under different conditions , like for example , ions in electromagnetic traps and ultracold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "furthermore , the quantum state of these systems may be engineered by performing quantum operations such as as quantum gates between ions @xcite , or the excitation of neutral atoms under the dipole blockade @xcite . in this way one can create deterministically collective entangled states , like the completely symmetric states with a single excited atom ( @xmath0-states ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , those are systems where atoms can be coupled to light in a very controlled way . since some of the atomic entangled states which may be created in those setups play an important role in the description of the interaction of atomic ensembles with light ,",
    "an important question arises , namely , can we use our control on the states of trapped atoms to generate useful quantum states of light ?",
    "if so , which are the properties of such states in terms of photon directionallity , purity , or photon entanglement ?",
    "a preliminary study of these ideas was recently presented in @xcite .",
    "the understanding of this problem requires a theoretical framework to describe the emission of light by collective atomic states under a variety of trapping conditions .",
    "related problems have been indeed a subject of investigation since the seminal work by dicke @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental systems that we have in mind share a few peculiarities which demand a new approach for their description .",
    "first , ultracold atoms are trapped in ordered arrangements such as coulomb crystals or optical lattices , where the distance between atoms , @xmath1 , is comparable to the wavelength of the light , @xmath2 .",
    "this situation is very different from dicke superradiance , where @xmath2 is larger than the size of the whole system .",
    "it also differs from the case of crystals , where @xmath3 as considered , for example , in @xcite .",
    "also , we study a situation in which atoms are initialized in a collective state , which is not necesarilly created by the absorption of a photon .",
    "thus , rather than the more traditional description in terms of light scattering , we need a theoretical model of the mapping between atomic collective excitations and photons .    in its more general form",
    "the above described situation poses a very complicated many - body problem .",
    "a crucial simplification is achieved by considering the low excitation sector of the atomic hilbert space , which in the holstein - primakoff ( hp ) approximation can be described in terms of bosonic spin - waves @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used in previous works , for example , to study dicke superradiance @xcite , slow propagation of light @xcite , and atom - light interfaces with atomic vapors @xcite .",
    "also , the emission of light by ensembles of harmonic oscillators was studied in @xcite , although in a different regime of trapping conditions than those considered here .    in this paper",
    "we make use of the hp approximation to describe the collective emission of light as a mapping between spin - wave excitations and photons . for atoms placed at fixed positions this mapping is a gaussian completely positive map @xcite , and we present a method to get explicit expressions of the photonic modes into which light is emitted .",
    "furthermore , we extend this formalism to study the case of atomic vapors .",
    "we obtain the following results : ( i ) for atoms trapped in a regular lattice , there is a regime in which photons may be emitted in a collimated beam , which requires that @xmath4 . in this regime , there is a renormalization of the emission rates , leading to a classification of the low - excitation atomic hilbert space in terms of superradiant and subradiant spin - waves",
    ". superradiant states decay with a rate that is enhanced by a factor @xmath5 , which depends on the dimensionality of the lattice . in 1d and 3d",
    "we determine the values @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , with @xmath8 the length of the lattice .",
    "this effect is related but not equivalent to dicke superradiance .",
    "( ii ) in the case of atomic vapors the collective characeter in the emission of light is determined by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the total number of atoms .",
    "the directional regime requires @xmath11 , and the emission rate is enhanced by @xmath12 .",
    "( iii ) some of these effects , like the renormalization of the emission rates and the directionality , could be observed in a relatively simple experiment with atoms in optical lattices .",
    "( iv ) by making use of coherent effects , photonic entangled states could be generated by trapped ions or neutral atoms .",
    "photons that are generated in this way could be collimated and in a pure state , and thus be useful in the context of quantum information .",
    "our first task is to describe the collective emission of light by an ensemble of atoms .",
    "first , we focus on the situation in which atoms are placed at fixed positions . at the end of the section we discuss the effect of atomic motion .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath10 atoms trapped by harmonic potentials with trapping frequency @xmath13 , and internal levels forming a @xmath14-scheme , see fig .",

    "we define atomic operators @xmath20 , @xmath21 , which fulfill the commutation relations , @xmath22   \\rangle = \\delta_{j , l } \\left ( 1 - 2 \\langle \\sigma^{\\rm ss}_j \\rangle   \\right ) . \\label{hp.approximation}\\ ] ] under the condition that the excitation probability of each atom is low , @xmath23 , we replace atomic operators by hp bosons , @xmath24 .",
    "the hp approximation allows us to recast the atom - light hamiltonian as a bosonic quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "after the adiabatic elimination of the upper level @xmath19 , our system is described by @xmath25 @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    "we consider , for the shake of clarity , a scalar model for the electromagnetic field , since our conclusions do not change when including the dipole pattern , as we show later .",

    "the spontaneous decay of @xmath35 back to @xmath42 is neglected in the forecoming analysis .",
    "this is justified either when collective effects enhance the @xmath43-@xmath34 channel , or by choosing @xmath43-@xmath34 to be a cycling transition , see appendix [ appendix.cycling ] .",
    "we deal first with the simplest case , in which atoms are placed at fixed positions and the motion of the atoms can be neglected .",
    "this is a good approximation in the lamb - dicke regime , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the ground state size in the harmonic trap .",
    "the effect of the motion is considered in the last subsection .",
    "this work relies on the observation that @xmath46 generates a beam - splitter transformation between atomic states and photons .",
    "the evolution of the atom - photon system can thus be understood in terms of a gaussian completely positive map @xcite . in the low excitation regime",
    ", any atomic state can be expressed in terms of bosonic excitations , @xmath47 we consider the following initial state , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the photon vacuum .",
    "our goal is to find the photon state @xmath50 at a time @xmath51 longer than the atomic decay time , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the total atom - system hamiltonian .",
    "together with the beam - splitter form of ( [ h.lm ] ) this implies that the problem is reduced to finding the exact form of the transformation , @xmath55 taking into account that @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , then @xmath58 can be found by using the relation , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the photon operator in the heisenberg picture . also , @xmath61 which shows that @xmath62 for @xmath51 longer than the atomic decay time .",
    "@xmath58 is thus the only interesting term , since it determines the photon mode into which light is radiated .",
    "its determination can be readly done by means of the heisenberg equation of motion for the photonic operators , which yields @xmath63 this equation is our starting point for the exact determination of the photonic modes .      to find the mapping between atomic and photonic modes , we need to solve the master equation , to calculate the time evolution of the atomic correlator in eq .",

    "we notice first that condition @xmath127 , implies that the atomic positions are not correlated with the atomic operators in eq .",
    "( [ g.jk ] ) .",
    "thus , we can describe the atomic radiative decay indepently of the evolution of atomic positions @xmath128 in ( [ g.jk ] ) .",

    "once the atomic dynamics is solved , our results on the atom - photon mapping can be used to describe the emitted photons .",
    "a general atomic state is mapped now into a mixed photonic state .",

    "note that the solution of the fast motion limit seems similar to the case of slow motion .",
    "however , the crucial difference is that in the fast case , we are allowed to solve the radiative emission problem , and to perform subsequently the spatial average in ( [ d.matrix ] ) .",
    "we will study in more detail this situation later in the case of an the collective emission properties of atomic ensambles .",
