    "this state was predicted on the basis of hartree - fock calculations@xcite and has been extensively studied experimentally.@xcite    when the interlayer distance , @xmath4 , in a bilayer quantum hall system at filling factor @xmath5 is large , one expects the system to behave as two isolated two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) with filling factor @xmath6 .",
    "it is then natural to infer that the ground state of the 2deg in a bilayer should be a striped state at @xmath0 at sufficiently large interlayer distances .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that , at @xmath0 interlayer interactions can lead to a homogeneous ground state with spontaneous phase coherence between the layers when the interlayer distance is comparable with the separation between electrons in a single layer .",
    "one might then conjecture that , as the interlayer separation is decreased , the striped state acquires a certain degree of coherence due to the interlayer interaction .",
    "this conjecture was first studied by brey and fertigbreystripes who showed that , as @xmath4 is increased from zero the bilayer ground state goes from a uniform coherent state ( ucs ) at small interlayer separations to a coherent striped phase ( csp )  at @xmath7 and then into a modulated striped state ( or anisotropic wigner crystal ) at @xmath8 .",

    "[ pattern ] is a state where charge density waves in the two layers are shifted by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the period of the stripes in one layer .",
    "the most interesting aspect of the csp is that in the regions where the charge densities in both layers overlap  ( in the plane of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) ) , the electrons are effectively in a linear superposition of states of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 indicates the right and left wells .",
    "the interlayer coherence is then maintained but only along linearly coherent regions ( lcr s ) whose width decreases as @xmath4 increases .",
    "the csp is most easily represented in the pseudospin language where an up ( down ) pseudospin is associated with the right ( left ) well .",
    "the csp is a pseudospin density wave where the pseudospins oscillates in the @xmath15 plane and the lcr s are the one - dimensional regions where the pseudospins lie along the @xmath16 direction in the @xmath17 plane .        in a previous work@xcite ,",
    "we have computed the collective excitations of the csp and showed that the low - energy modes of this phase could be described by an effective pseudospin wave hamiltonian .",
