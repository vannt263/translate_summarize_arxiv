    "there is an ongoing interest in the theory of interaction of swift charged projectiles with condensed matter .",
    "although most theoretical works have reported on the energy loss of ions in a target medium which is modelled as a three - dimensional ( 3d ) electron gas , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case has not yet received as much attention as the 3d case .",
    "a 2d electron system is now experimentally realizable in a laboratory . in the last three decades or so many interesting and intriguing properties of a 2d electron gas",
    "have been explored .",
    "for a recent update on some of these developments we refer to refs .",
    "a widely used 2d electron system is realized at the interface between gaas and ga@xmath0al@xmath1as , and in the interface metal - oxide - semiconductors ( mos ) .",
    "the interaction of charged particles with an electron gas is an important probe of many - body interactions in the target electron medium .",
    "it is known that many - body properties of an electron gas vary in notable aspects with spatial dimensions .",
    "it is therefore of interest to make a detailed study of interaction of charged particles with a 2d electron gas .",
    "this theoretical study is also of relevance to device applications e.g. in using ion implantation in devices which involve 2d electron systems .    in general , interaction of charged projectiles with condensed matter",
    "can be studied by means of the stopping power ( sp ) of the target medium .",
    "the sp accounts for the energy loss by an external charged projectile as it passes through and interacts with matter . and",
    "the sp of a medium can be used to construct diagnostic tools for studying this kind of physical systems .",
    "there have been several theoretical approaches to the energy loss and sp for 3d systems , and some of these approaches have been applied also to a 2d electron gas . among previous theoretical works on a 2d electron gas some",
    "are based on the linear response dielectric function method bre93,bre94,bre98,wan95,wang95,bal06 and quantum scattering theory nag95,kra95,wan97,ber97 .",
    "further works have dealt with some nonlinear screening effects through a quadratic response approach within the random - phase approximation @xcite , the employment of density functional theory @xcite and in a method based on frequency moments of the energy loss function @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider fast charged projectiles and hence a linear response theory to calculate energy loss is expected to be adequate .",
    "previously , within this approach , bret and deutsch calculated the sp of an ion @xcite and a dicluster @xcite in a 2d electron gas for any degeneracy .",
    "their results show some interesting differences with the corresponding results for a 3d case .",
    "of special interest is their finding that the leading term of the asymptotic expansion of the sp in a high - velocity limit decreases as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the projectile velocity , which differs from the well - known form predicted by the bethe - bloch formula @xcite in the 3d case . the calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite are based on the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) which works well if electron - electron interaction can be neglected .",
    "now , in 2d systems , electron density can be varied . for moderate values of electron density e.g. in semiconductors",
    "electron - electron interaction may not be negligible and going beyond rpa is desirable .",
    "our objective is to consider two physically motivated aspects of a 2d electron gas in the context of energy loss .",
    "for the first part of our study we consider a disordered electron gas which contains impurities .",
    "the effect of these impurities is included through a phenomenological relaxation time for electrons due to scattering by impurities .",
    "for this disordered system we use a linear response dielectric function in rpa and in a number - conserving relaxation time approximation ( rta ) , which was first considered by mermin @xcite and then by das @xcite for a 3d electron gas .",
    "this rta formulation has not yet been extended beyond rpa .",
    "the effect of disorder which leads to a damping of excitations enters the rpa dielectric function , for a given electron - impurity collision frequency , through @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is used as a model parameter . for a degenerate electron gas ( deg ) and for a given electron density",
    ", the damping parameter can be assumed to be a constant to a good approximation .",
    "the disorder - inclusive dielectric function , with the collision frequency as a free parameter , allows some physical insight and useful numerical estimates of the influence of disorder on energy loss in a deg . in 3d",
    "the predicted effect is a shorter life time with a smaller propagation wavelength of plasmons resulting considerable modifications of the sp ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . for the stopping of a single ion , the broadening of the plasmon peak with increasing @xmath5 shifts the threshold for energy loss by plasmon excitation towards lower projectile velocities .",
    "it now becomes possible for low - velocity projectile ions to excite plasmons ( in addition to single - particle excitations ) .",
    "this increases the sp of 3d electron gas at low projectile velocities , compared to the disorder - free rpa result ner04,ner08,ash80 .",
    "the situation with a 2d electron gas will be discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "the second objective of our study is to investigate the influence of exchange - correlation interaction ( i.e. beyond rpa ) in an electron gas on the sp . for a 3d electron system",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the sp in low and intermediate velocity regimes shows a definite increase due to this interaction .",
    "a similar result has been reported for a 2d system wan95,wang95 .",
    "however let us note that if an asymptotic expansion of the sp in a high - velocity regime is considered then it has been shown previously that the first term in this expansion is unaffected by electron - electron interaction . in this paper we calculate the next non - vanishing term of this asymptotic expansion and show that it behaves as @xmath6 $ ] , where exchange - correlation interactions are involved in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these functions depend on the target density through wigner - seitz density parameter @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are electron gas density and bohr radius , respectively .",
