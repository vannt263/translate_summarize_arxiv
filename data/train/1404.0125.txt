    "ground - based observational efforts for direct detection have focused on the redshift `` sweet - spot '' of @xmath0 34 where the lyc is shifted to the optical and yet a low enough redshift that the average number of intervening absorption systems is not too great to hinder the detection of lyc emission .",

    "this discrepancy is caused by a small number of strong ly@xmath17  emitting lbgs adding a disproportionate weight to the average spectrum profile .",

    "we note that not correcting for this effect results in a larger discrepancy in the distributions discussed below , thus our analysis is conservative .",
    "our next step is to examine the composite spectral sample and data distributions on the @xmath56 vs.  @xmath54 plane . although the composite spectra are constructed directly from the s03 data , we find that the distributions differ ( figure  [ conventional ] ) .",
    "the composite spectral samples have a relatively smooth distribution throughout the standard colour - selection region with a density that peaks near the redshift distribution peak ( @xmath57 2.96 , 1@xmath58 0.29 ; s03 ) in accordance with the expectations of the templates , whereas the data distribution is seen crowded to bluer @xmath56 colours and has a peak density near the @xmath59 colour selection border .",

    "0.30 ]    factors that can lead to a difference in @xmath4 magnitudes include ( 1 ) a @xmath4-band red leak , ( 2 ) assignment of @xmath4-band non - detections to an arbitrary magnitude ( i.e. , the limiting magnitude of the survey ) , ( 3 ) the effects of wavelength - dependent flux loss in the spectroscopy in which the composite spectra are formed , and/or ( 4 ) the initial condition of zero flux shortward of 912 .",

    "redleak is determined not to contribute to the distribution discrepancy but we consider a 10@xmath61 magnitude leak ( 0.1 mag ) below as a conservative measure and to test the overall effect redleak has on the distribution .",

    "the resulting photometry can only provide lower limits for objects with large colours , such as those with little or no flux in the @xmath4 band and appear as non - detections or ` drop - outs ' .",

    "* ) at the keck observatory in multi - object spectroscopic mode using slitmasks prior to the availability of an atmospheric dispersion corrector . because the slitlets are fixed at a given position angle during integration , flux can be lost due to atmospheric dispersion over the course of the observation as the slitlet position angle changes with respect to the parallactic angle . assessing",
    "potential wavelength - dependent flux loss in the spectroscopic observations is difficult .",
    "fortunately , considerable effort was made in the design and execution of the observations to minimize this effect by designing the position angles of the slitmasks near the parallactic angle at mid - observation , observing the targets at low airmass and as they pass the meridian , and limiting the length of the exposure times . as a result ,",
    "the observations should have incurred little wavelength - dependent flux loss .",
    "nevertheless , we estimate the flux loss and its impact on the lbg colour - colour distribution .",
    "the close , @xmath55 0.02 magnitude , agreement between the composite spectral sample and photometric data distributions on the @xmath63 vs.  @xmath52 colour - magnitude diagram demonstrates that the flux loss between the @xmath53 and @xmath52 bandpasses is small and provides a constraint on the average amount of flux lost in the @xmath4 bandpass .",
    "given the amplitude of the flux loss constraint between the @xmath53 and @xmath52 bandpasses , we compute the range of flux loss in the @xmath4 bandpass from observations with slit position angles that change by various amounts from 045 degrees off parallactic during 2 and 3 hour long integrations while passing through 1.11.5 airmass corresponding to the respective ranges in the observations ( or greater ) .",

    "this curve represents a theoretical infinitely deep @xmath4-band survey in which all colours can be measured .",
    "the strengths of the effects on the @xmath4-band magnitude discussed above on the composite spectral sample distributions is traced in figure  [ conventional ] by the change in the mean composite spectrum evolutionary track .",
    "the thick light - blue curve is the track that includes the assignment of the @xmath4-band non - detections to the limiting magnitude of the fields .",

    "the thick red curve incorporates both the @xmath4-band non - detection assignments and a 0.34 magnitude increase to the @xmath4 flux of the composite spectra to accommodate both slit flux loss and @xmath4-band red leak ( 0.24 + 0.1 magnitude , respectively ) .",
    "the contours in the upper panel of figure  [ conventional ] outline the expected distribution of s03 lbgs for the latter case : assigning @xmath4 magnitude limits , slit flux loss , and red leak contributions ( i.e. , the thick red track ) .",
    "the distribution reveals that , although the combination of these three effects make a noticeable difference , and move the distribution in the direction of the data , their contributions fall well short of resolving the distribution discrepancy .",
    "this leaves the likelihood that the bulk of the difference between the two distributions is caused by a genuine excess in @xmath4-band flux .",
    "this above result does not consider @xmath4-band flux contamination from lower redshift sources in the line of sight .",
    "we address this topic in detail in  [ contam ] but mention a few points here .",
    "the s03 photometry is measured in 2 arcsec apertures , which differs in nature to narrow - band surveys that measure extended flux .",
    "any lower redshift source would need to physically overlap the photometric aperture , albeit only weakly ( i.e. , even the wings of a faint line - of - sight source might offer a measurable contribution ) .",
    "however , at least two effects act to keep the contamination rate low , ( 1 ) @xmath64 25.5 @xmath0 3  lbgs are small in size ( faint point source - like objects ) and have a relative low surface density ( @xmath211.8 arcmin@xmath65 ) and ( 2 ) some line - of - sight sources overlapping with lbg apertures contribute to all colours such that they no longer meet the standard lbg criteria . as we show later , we find that the number of lbgs meeting the standard criteria with measurable ( i.e. , down to a level of m @xmath21 28 ) lyc contamination is small and is insufficient to explain the distribution mismatch . as a result ,",
    "the existence of unaccounted @xmath4-band flux , combined with the fact that lbgs in the literature have measured , non - negligible , observed lyc flux (  [ intro ] ) , make it worthwhile to re - examine the lbg colour - selection criteria and the colour expectations of galaxies with various levels of observed lyc flux .",
    "to determine the expectations for galaxies with surviving lyc flux , we modify the composite spectra and a star - forming galaxy template by adding flux using two models : ( 1 ) a ` flat ' model , that includes flux from 912  to the shortest wavelength probed by the @xmath4-band , depending on the galaxy s redshift , to explore the effects of flux contributions extending to short wavelengths and ( 2 ) a ` step ' model that includes flux between 800912 , motivated by the observation of apparent ( or potential ) flux down to @xmath21800  in @xcite and to test a range of wavelength between zero lyc flux expectations ( 912 ) and that of the flat model .",
    "the two models are pictorially represented in figure  [ ungr ] . because we are measuring the integrated flux shortward of 912  using blunt tools in the form of broadband filters ,",
    "the details of erratic flux profiles resulting from the multitude of igm systems in the line - of - sight are smoothed over . as a result ,",
    "@xmath51  reported here reflects the fraction of lyc flux integrated over the relevant wavelengths when compared to the flux measured at 1500  from the composite spectra .",
    "thus , the ` step ' model is denoted as @xmath66(800 ) and the ` flat ' model is denoted as @xmath66@xmath67 .    figure  [ z3 ] shows the effects on the composite spectra evolutionary tracks for the two models from @xmath68 to @xmath69 when including various values of @xmath51 . in both panels , the near vertical , thick - lined evolutionary tracks represent zero flux below 912  colour - coded as red , orange , green , and blue corresponding to quartiles 14 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the thin - lined tracks represent composite spectra evolution with added lyc flux .",
    "as @xmath51is increased , the farther the tracks peel off from the zero lyc flux tracks and down toward bluer @xmath56 colours .",
    "it is readily apparent that galaxy colours are very sensitive to even a small amount of surviving lyc flux .",

    "the difference between the two models lies in the shortest wavelength that flux is assigned .",
    "when considering @xmath22 2.74.5 galaxies , the ` step ' model provides an approximate mid - point between the zero lyc flux evolutionary tracks and the tracks of the ` flat ' model which span the full range of outcomes .",
    "other observed lyc wavelength ranges can be roughly interpolated between the expectations of the zero lyc flux evolutionary tracks and those of the two models .",
    "the @xmath56 colours of galaxies at all redshifts studied are sensitive to both the amount and the wavelength extent of the lyc flux , with the sensitivities increasing with redshift .",
    "inspection of the ` flat ' model in the upper panel reveals that for @xmath72 3.5 galaxies it only requires a small amount of lyc flux , @xmath66@xmath73 1 percent [ @xmath28  @xmath16 100 ] to move the tracks from infinity ( zero lyc flux case ) down to @xmath74 4 and only @xmath66@xmath73 5 percent [ @xmath28  @xmath16 20 ] to move the tracks to @xmath74 2 .",
    "the results are similar for the ` step ' model shown in the lower panel for objects at @xmath9 3.8 where @xmath75 800  restframe flux falls in the @xmath4-band .    for both models , @xmath76 3.5 galaxies with small to moderate @xmath51  have noticeable changes to their @xmath56 colour but remain in the standard selection colour region",
    ". however , higher amounts of lyc flux can affect their @xmath56 colour such that a significant fraction of galaxies fall out of the standard colour - selection region .",
    "many of these ` missed ' galaxies evade lower redshift , e.g. , bx and bm , criteria and reside in a relatively unexplored region of high redshift galaxy colour space .",
    "this region is occupied by a higher density of low redshift sources and presents complications in devising efficient selection criteria .",
    "the results for @xmath0 4  galaxies in the @xmath54 vs. @xmath77 colour - colour plane is very similar to that for @xmath0 3  shown here .",
    "typically , the @xmath56 vs.  @xmath54 plane is not considered in @xmath0 4 galaxy selection .",
    "however , we find that isolating galaxies on this colour - colour plane can be an effective approach to select galaxies with measurable lyc flux at @xmath0 4  from high - density regions containing low redshift sources .",
    "galaxies at @xmath0 4  are located in the right half of figure  [ z3 ] and beyond the @xmath22 3.5 markers ( small black squares ) .",
    "deep near - uv ( nuv ) imaging and a parallel analysis on the @xmath78 vs.  @xmath56 plane would enable @xmath0 2  and @xmath0 3  galaxy selection following a similar approach to that presented here for @xmath0 3  and @xmath0 4 .",
    "moreover , photometric redshifts using optical to far infrared data , including deep medium - band infrared photometry , hold great promise in selecting a more complete population of @xmath0 34 galaxies @xcite .",
    "we have applied this approach to select @xmath0 35 galaxies with expected escaping lyc flux and report the results in a forthcoming companion paper .    as verified below , analyzing the colours and ly@xmath17  ews of @xmath0 34 galaxies with respect to the composite spectra expectations provides a powerful tool to predict the fraction and wavelength extent of the escaping ionizing photons .",

    "the ` flat ' model shows that uniform lyc flux at the level found between 880910down to the @xmath21740  is within the range of the data but , considering the ` step ' model results , suggests that the lyc flux does not typically extend to wavelengths shortward of @xmath21800  for the sample .",
    "finally , our analysis shows that the colours of the @xcite data set are unexpected for quartile 4 lbgs in the ` standard ' picture .",
    "although their @xmath54 colours are highly consistent with their redshift and their spectral properties are in agreement , their @xmath56 colours are much bluer than that predicted by composite spectra ( or star - forming templates ) with little , or zero , lyc flux . instead , their colours are what is expected for the composite spectra with an added lyc flux of @xmath215% .",

    "we remark that our composite spectra are constructed from the lbg spectra of s03 . as such",
    ", they accurately represent the colours of @xmath0 3  lbgs selected using standard colour selection criteria longward of the lyman limit .",
    "because we replace all flux shortward of the lyman limit with artificial flux values , the composite spectra and the composite spectral sample distributions are not subject to line - of - sight contamination .",
    "only the actual data of s03 on an individual object basis are subject to contamination , and thus our @xmath0 3  lbg @xmath3  and @xmath12  estimates .",

    "the @xmath1 images were aligned / registered and then smoothed with a gaussian kernel to the same seeing fwhm . then lbgs",
    "are identified in the @xmath52-band image by their @xmath211500  flux in isophotal apertures with @xmath212 arcsec diameters , which were then grown to @xmath213 arcsec ( @xmath210.1 - 0.15 magnitude difference between the two apertures ) .",
    "the pixels defining the extent of the @xmath52-band detections for each lbg were then used to determine the flux in the other filters .",
    "this was done because many of the objects are not detected in the @xmath4-band .",
    "the half - light radii of @xmath0 3  lbgs range from @xmath2115 kpc , or @xmath210.10.6 arcsec @xcite . because the seeing fwhm for the observations ranged from 0.71.2 arcsec , @xmath0 3  lbgs appear as point sources or near point sources .",
    "as as result , lower redshift objects must overlap the point source - like area of the lbgs in the @xmath4 filter if they are to contribute to the lyc flux .",
    "this constraint is one important difference between our measurement and narrowband lyc imaging searches .",
    "we are not measuring the extended and/or offset lyc flux that is commonly observed in those surveys . extended and/or offset flux increases the probability of lower redshift source contamination and source confusion by probing an additional area with respect to the stellar component of the lbg .",
    "however , because we do not include extended or offset regions , we measure a lower limit to the true amount of escaping lyc flux but potentially a higher value than that measured through a spectroscopic slit .",
    "low redshift sources have a large range in magnitude and sizes / shapes and a high density in the deep images , whereas s03 lbgs are small sources with @xmath52 = 19.025.5 and a relatively low surface density of @xmath211.8 lbgs arcmin@xmath65 .",
    "thus , it is much more accurate to simulate the overlap of field sources on the areas of lbgs than vice - versa .",
    "lower redshift objects in the line of sight that are @xmath2114 magnitudes fainter in the @xmath4-band than the @xmath53-band for a given lbg could measurably contribute to the lyc flux . finally , brighter objects that are not completely extracted or that pose problematic blending with the lbgs can affect the @xmath1 photometry in a way to push the colours outside the standard selection region .",
    "we use the 5-year stacked , wide - field @xmath98 images of the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) deep fields to estimate the fraction of lbgs with line - of - sight contamination .",
    "the @xmath99 filter is similar to , but has a redder bandpass than , the @xmath4 filter , the @xmath100 and @xmath53 bands are similar , and the @xmath52 filter falls in - between the @xmath101 and @xmath102 filters .",
    "the cfhtls has a limiting magnitude of @xmath99 = 27.4 , signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) = 5 . if we include all objects with @xmath103 , we probe depths to roughly @xmath104 28.0 , similar to the 1@xmath62 limits of the s03 survey .",
    "the cfhtls images provide a deep test of the contamination and the results are conservative in the sense that most field objects are brighter in @xmath99 as compared to the bluer @xmath4 bandpass .",
    "we generate simulated lbgs using the composite spectra technique which uses magnitudes from the @xmath52-band magnitude distribution and computes their @xmath4 and @xmath53 magnitudes assuming zero lyc flux .",
    "we then compute the @xmath105 magnitudes for the lbgs and place them in the cfhtls square degree images with the surface density and area equivalent to s03 survey fields . as a control , we lay the same simulated lbgs in a `` blank '' image with simulated sky noise at the level measured in the cfhtls images .",
    "the lbgs are then extracted using @xmath106 @xcite in a consistent manner to s03 .",
    "we then compare object magnitudes from the `` blank '' and real images to the faint limit where we find equal numbers of positive and negative flux enhancements as a result of sky fluctuations .",
    "objects that had their magnitudes enhanced to the point where they were pushed out of the standard selection region are not included .",
    "we measure a 5.3% net positive enhancement to the @xmath99-band flux of objects in the standard lbg selection region . as an additional test",
    ", we multiply the @xmath106 segmentation map for the lbgs in the control field with the @xmath99-band segmentation map which uses @xmath102-band defined apertures ( to mimic s03 @xmath52-band apertures ) .",
    "we find detection of @xmath99-band flux in 5.2% of the apertures . as a result",
    ", we adopt a 5.3% contamination fraction to the s03 sample from lower redshift line - of - sight sources .",
    "finally , for a total contamination to the lyc flux from all sources , we include an estimate of @xmath76 2 sources and agn contained in the s03 data . from their 940 spectra ,",
    "40 galactic stars , five @xmath76 2 galaxies , and 28 agn were identified . combining this 7.8% contamination with the line - of - sight contamination",
    ", we estimate a total 13.1% contamination to the photometric sample . assuming that the contaminants make up the 13.1% of the galaxies that have the highest @xmath3 , we remove these objects from the data and produce the corrected average ` flat ' and ` step ' model values listed in table  [ grid ] .",
    "we conclude that foreground and agn contamination are not the main contributors to the @xmath4-band flux excess observed in the s03 data distribution ( figure  [ conventional ] , lower panel ) and that genuine lyc flux remains the best candidate to explain the bulk of the excess .",
    "the modified composite spectra evolutionary tracks and @xmath3distribution truncations , the colour - colour distribution of the data , and the spectroscopic confirmations of the vvds all point to the existence of a population of galaxies outside the standard criteria with bluer @xmath56 colours .",
    "because the evolutionary tracks of the composite spectra indicate that these galaxies have moderate to significant amount of lyc flux , and that essentially none should have zero lyc flux , we refer to galaxies in this region as lyman continuum galaxies ( lcgs ) .",
    "the full behaviour of @xmath22 2.73.5 galaxies can be visually reproduced by extending the maximum range of the quartile @xmath3values and keeping the quartile - to - quartile ratio ( i.e. , countering the effect of truncation ) .",
    "figure  [ fesc ] presents one such realisation when extending the measured quartile @xmath3  values in table  [ grid ] by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "all values of @xmath3  in table  [ grid ] produce similar distributions , along with multiplicative factors ranging from 12.5 .",
    "the match in figure  [ fesc ] shows that lcgs make up @xmath2132 percent of the full @xmath0 3 galaxy population , or @xmath2150% the number of lbgs .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of lcgs is only a few percent lower without _ any _ extension of the @xmath3  values .",
    "if these realisations are representative of the true galaxy distribution , the current census of uv - luminous @xmath0 3  star - forming galaxies needs to be increased by a factor of @xmath211.5 .",
    "moreover , lcgs are expected to have high levels of observed lyc flux and may contribute as much total ionising flux as the lbg population or more .    [ 0.29 ]    statistical fits do not yield unique solutions to the distribution fits because of the unknown lcg distribution . as a result ,",
    "our simple @xmath3  distribution prescription in figure  [ fesc ] is not a formal fit , but is meant to help illustrate the @xmath56 vs. @xmath54 location of @xmath0 3  lcgs and estimate their number density .",
    "nevertheless , our attempts to mimic the photometric distribution of the data using a wide range of @xmath3  values , and distributions of the values , have uncovered some interesting results and unavoidable constraints for each quartile , and for the full population , that are reinforced by the distribution and lyc measurements of the 794 spectra .",
    "firstly , no combination of lyc flux assignments to the composite spectral samples , including zero lyc flux , can achieve a similar distribution as the data , and/or a peak density near the @xmath56 = @xmath54 + 1 boundary , without incurring a significant fraction of galaxies outside the standard lbg selection region . as discussed in ",
    "[ conv_exp ] , this fact is also revealed by the data distribution .",
    "the location on the colour - colour plane of the galaxies predicted outside the standard selection region is highly consistent with the colours of the spectroscopically confirmed vvds @xmath0 3 galaxies found in that region @xcite .",
    "secondly , the galaxies predicted outside the standard colour - selection region are expected to have moderate to high levels of observed lyc flux ( 1 ) from our composite spectral analysis and ( 2 ) because they have @xmath54 colours that are typical for their redshifts but bluer than typical @xmath56 colours , denoting an excess of @xmath4-band flux .",
    "the @xmath4-band probes the restframe lyc at @xmath107 3 and any excess @xmath4-band flux for a @xmath107 3 galaxy equates to excess lyc flux .",
    "thirdly , to match the shape and location of the data distribution , @xmath51  must be assigned as a function of ly@xmath17  ew ( quartile ) such that lbgs with strong ly@xmath17  in emission ( quartile 4 ) have higher observed lyc flux than those with successively weaker ly@xmath17  emission .",
    "this relationship is seen for the individual spectra by quartile in table  [ grid ] for both models and all @xmath4 magnitude assignments . from our @xmath3  assignment tests",
    ", the relationship appears to exist beyond the effect caused by the constraint of galaxies to the standard colour - selection region . a positive correlation between ly@xmath17  and escaping lyc flux",
    "is expected to first order ( after the net loss in ly@xmath17  to lyc photons ) given that the ly@xmath17  and lyc radiation transfer are both sensitive to the presence of hi in the ism .",
    "thus it may be that galaxies with ly@xmath17  in emission and their corresponding properties , such as bluer continua , weaker ism metal - line features , compact morphology , field - like environments , and potentially higher merger rates , or their orientation may cause higher intrinsic lyc escape fractions .    finally , the composite spectra evolutionary tracks indicate that a fraction of @xmath9 3.0 lcgs , comprised largely of quartile 4 galaxies , fall in the standard ` bx ' selection region , whereas @xmath107 3.0 lcgs ( from all quartiles ) reside outside any standard selection region .",
    "essentially all quartile 1 and 2 lcgs with @xmath51@xmath16 10 percent are missed using standard selection criteria and all @xmath108 lcgs from all quartiles with @xmath51  @xmath16 1 percent are missed using standard @xmath0 4  criteria .",
    "a rough estimate of the mean observed lyc flux of lcgs can be gleaned from our match of the composite spectral samples to the data distribution .",

    "however , to match the photometric distribution of the data we are forced to assign a higher level of lyc flux to composite spectral samples with higher ly@xmath17  ew which suggests that part of this relationship may also be intrinsic .",
    "both ly@xmath17  and lyc radiation transfer are sensitive to hi .",
    "thus , it may be that galaxies with ly@xmath17  in emission , and their corresponding properties such as bluer continua , weaker ism metal - line features , compact morphology , field - like environments , and potentially higher merger rates , or their orientation cause higher lyc escape fractions",
    "both the distribution of the data and the evolutionary tracks of the modified composite spectra require a significant fraction of @xmath0 34 galaxies residing outside the standard colour - selection region .",
    "galaxies at @xmath0 34 with colours outside the standard lbg selection region have been spectroscopically confirmed by the vvds magnitude - limited survey and reside in the locations predicted by the evolutionary tracks of the modified composite spectra",
    "many of the galaxies found outside the standard colour - selection region are missed by other ( i.e. , lower redshift ) selection criteria .",
    "the ` missed ' galaxies are expected to have moderate to high levels of escaping lyc flux from their bluer @xmath56 colours and from the predictions of the composite spectra evolutionary tracks and are termed lyman continuum galaxies ( lcgs ) .",
    "lcgs are estimated to increase the census of @xmath0 3  galaxies by a factor of @xmath211.5 .",
    "8 .   matching the composite spectral samples to the photometric data distribution , we estimate @xmath3  = 15.8 @xmath109 and @xmath12  = 33.0 @xmath110 percent for lcgs and @xmath3  = 7.6 @xmath111 and @xmath12  = 15.9 @xmath112 percent for the combined @xmath0 3  lbg + lcg population using the same assumptions for lbgs above .",
    "lcgs reside in a region of colour - colour space with a high density of low redshift sources .",
    "we find that examining the colours of @xmath0 4  lcgs on the @xmath56 vs. @xmath54 plane , typically used for @xmath0 3  colour selection , provides one means to increase the selection efficiency .",
    "a parallel analysis using deep near - uv imaging can be used to efficiently select @xmath0 3  galaxies .",
    "our analysis has helped confirm that conventional lbg colour - selection criteria do not include the entire @xmath0 3  galaxy population .",
    "this point has been know since the criteria conception and has been reinforced by spectroscopic identifications of @xmath0 34 galaxies outside the standard @xmath0 3  selection region .",
    "the modified composite spectra provide a physical basis for the existence of lcgs and indicate that they require flux in the bluest filter ( i.e. , the ` drop - out ' filter ) and , thus , have high levels of lyc flux .",
    "efficient selection of @xmath0 34 remains a challenge , however , deep broadband and medium band infrared ( restframe optical ) imaging provides a promising approach . the number density of lbgs remains to be quantified as well as properties that may facilitate high escaping flux , including their uv continua slopes , seds , line - of - sight ly@xmath17forest decrements , average outflow strengths , orientation , and the effects of environment and interactions .",
    "the measured lyc flux for lcgs , when added to the lyc flux measured here for lbgs , will help clarify the full contribution of galaxies to the reionisation of the universe .",
