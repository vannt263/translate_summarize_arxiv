    "the anisotropy is best calculated in cartesian coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where@xmath203this form is readily evaluated and gives after transformation to polar coordinates @xmath204thus the deformation field @xmath75 significantly modifies the curvature in the vicintiy of the particle .",
    "the additonal term decays with the fourth power of the distance ; because of its fourfold symmetry , the angular modulation is maximum along the principal axes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and minimum in between .",

    "we conclude by comparing the purely geometrical force ( [ 18 ] ) with the well - known force arising for heavy particles on a curved interface @xcite .",

    "( [ 18 ] )  reveals that its first term @xmath233 is by a factor @xmath234 smaller than the weight - induced force @xmath235 .",
    "this means that the geometrical force studied here is relevant if ( i ) the first term @xmath236 is significantly smaller than @xmath237 , or if ( ii ) the gravity - induced forces are small , that is , if the effective density @xmath225 is small as compared to the density contrast @xmath232 of the two fluids .",
    "starting from the well - known form ( [ 6 ] ) , we have evaluated the trapping energy of a spherical particle to quadratic order in the curvature parameters .",
    "\\(i ) on a formal level , the introduction of the shift @xmath3 of the vertical partical position , leads to a remarkably simple equation ( [ 13b ] ) for young s law at the three - phase boundary , which is solved in ( [ 7 ] ) .",

    "\\(iii ) as a main result , eq . (",
    "[ 16 ] ) shows that both the total curvature @xmath238 and the anisotropy @xmath13 lower the energy and thus enhance trapping . as a consequence , both terms of the curvature - induced lateral force ( [ 18 ] ) drive particles toward strongly curved regions .",
