    "<S> this paper analyzes a new self - avoiding ( sa ) meshwork model using the canonical monte carlo simulation technique on lattices that consist of connection - fixed triangles . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of this model includes a self - avoiding potential and a pressure term . </S>",
    "<S> the model identifies a crumpled - to - tubule ( ct ) transition between the crumpled and tubular phases . </S>",
    "<S> this is a second - order transition , which occurs when the pressure difference between the inner and outer sides of the surface is close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the flory swelling exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 corresponding to the mean square radius of gyration @xmath2 and enclosed volume @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the fractal dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis shows that @xmath1 at the transition is almost identical to the one of the smooth phase of previously reported sa model which has no crumpled phase . </S>"
