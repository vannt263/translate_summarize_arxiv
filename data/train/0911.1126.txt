    "we briefly summarize this information .",
    "this analysis is based on the hst / acs f814w ( @xmath25 ) images of the 1.8 deg@xmath26 cosmos field @xcite . in particular",
    ", we applied a faint magnitude limit of @xmath27 and a minimum size cut of @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 the half - light radius ) to the acs - based catalog of @xcite , to ensure a reliable morphological classification .",
    "this is based on the zest approach described in scarlata et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , with a re - grouping of galaxies into five classes : ( i ) _ e : _ pure elliptical galaxies ( zest type 1 ) , ( ii ) _ b : _ bulge - dominated disk galaxies .",
    "these are the zest type 2.0 galaxies , which have non - negligible disk components , but otherwise show global structural properties similar to ellipticals ( e.g. concentration , @xmath30-sersic values , etc ) ; ( iii ) _ s : _ spiral galaxies with intermediate bulge properties ( zest type 2.1 and 2.2 together ) , ( iv ) _ d : _ pure - disk galaxies without any bulge ( zest type 2.3 ) , and , finally , ( v ) _ i : _ irregular galaxies ( zest type 3 ) including disturbed merging galaxies .",
    "we checked that our results are not biased by misclassification of galaxies at higher redshifts due to the cosmological surface brightness dimming and the smaller apparent sizes of the galaxies .",
    "our fiducial photometric redshifts are derived using 11 cosmos passbands , from @xmath31 to spitzer 4.5@xmath32 , and our _ zurich extragalactic bayesian redshift analyzer _",
    "( zebra ) code @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in our photo-@xmath33 estimates are @xmath34 [ @xmath35 down to @xmath36 [ @xmath37 .",
    "we also checked our results with the photometric redshifts of @xcite , which are based on 30 photometric bands including many narrow- and intermediate - band filters , and show a dispersion of @xmath38 ( and @xmath39 down to @xmath40 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the advantage for us of using our own zebra photo-@xmath33 s is that we know their shortcomings and can thus assess how these affect the final results .",
    "we stress , however , that our results remain unchanged when using either of the two photo - z catalogs .",
    "this is true also for the corresponding stellar mass estimates , which were derived by fitting standard synthetic stellar population model seds to the broad - band photometry of each galaxy at its photometric redshift .",
    "our fiducial sed library is based on @xcite models following exponentially declining star - formation histories reddened by smc dust @xcite ( for more details see oesch et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "the mass completeness of our catalog was conservatively estimated to be the mass of the model sed with the highest mass - to - light ratio in our template library .",
    "the resulting minimum measurable mass at @xmath41 is @xmath42 , and in the following analysis we always stay above this limit .",
    "the well - established role of stellar mass in affecting galaxy properties makes it mandatory to separate different mass bins when searching for further evolutionary trends in the galaxy population . in our study , we therefore split our mass - complete sample in two mass intervals , namely @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the boundaries of these two mass bins are chosen so as to include roughly an equal number of galaxies in each bin and to provide sufficiently robust statistics .",
    "the total number of galaxies in the bins are 4894 ( @xmath45 ) and 3707 ( @xmath44 ) , respectively .",
    "we also explore what happens at the very highest mass scales , i.e. , for galaxies with @xmath46 : there are a total of 222 such galaxies in our sample .",
    "the redshift evolution of the mass fraction in different morphological types in our mass bins is plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : fraczevol2 ] .",
    "different colors for the curves identify ellipticals ( red ) , bulge - dominated disk galaxies ( burgundy ) , intermediate spirals ( light blue ) , bulge - less disk galaxies ( dark blue ) , and irregulars ( green ) respectively . this color scheme is maintained in other figures in the paper . here and in the following ,",
    "errorbars for small number statistics are computed using @xcite .        at the mass scales and epochs of our study",
    ", we note that irregular galaxies are just a minor fraction of the population , which stays remarkably constant at the @xmath47 level throughout the @xmath48 window .",
    "similarly , at these mass scales and epochs , the bulge - less disk galaxies provide an almost negligible contribution to the overall galaxy population . above @xmath49 ,",
    "their contribution is @xmath47 at @xmath50 , and they essentially disappear by @xmath51 . at the @xmath52 mass scale ,",
    "their contribution declines rapidly from @xmath10 at @xmath50 to a negligible 2% by @xmath53 .    at @xmath50 the smaller mass bin ( @xmath54 )",
    "is clearly dominated by intermediate - type disk galaxies ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fraczevol2 ] ) , which contribute about 50% by mass to the whole galaxy population .",
    "this fraction decreases gradually towards @xmath030 - 40% by @xmath53 which is compensated by a rising importance of galaxies of earlier morphological types , i.e. , by ellipticals and by bulge - dominated disk galaxies . at @xmath50",
    "these two populations contribute about 10 - 15% each to the total galaxy population in this mass bin ; by @xmath55 , these fractions rise to @xmath56% for the ellipticals and to @xmath57% for bulge - dominated disk galaxies .",
    "we also note that , at these galaxy mass scales , the fraction of stellar mass locked in the elliptical galaxy population is similar to that in bulge - dominated disk galaxies at @xmath50 .",
    "the latter rises in importance towards lower redshifts much more rapidly than the @xmath58 , however , and dominates the mass density of early - type galaxies by redshifts of order @xmath59 . from the above fractions we estimate that galaxies above @xmath60 @xmath15 , which transform their morphology into an early - type ( either @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , have a @xmath65 probability to retain a non - negligible disk ( i.e. become @xmath61 galaxies ) .    for galaxy masses above @xmath5 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fraczevol2 ] ) , the redshift evolution of the morphological fractions of galaxies of all types is much weaker than at the lower masses .",
    "intermediate - type disk galaxies are still a major contributor to the mass density budget in this bin , but here they dominate only at the highest redshift , where they account for about 40% of the galaxy population .",
    "early type galaxies ( @xmath58 and the bulge - dominated @xmath61 galaxies ) contribute larger fractions than at lower masses , both of order @xmath66 at @xmath67 , rising up to about 30% and 40% by @xmath53 , respectively .    within the errors , the highest mass ellipticals ( @xmath68 )",
    "maintain their predominance over early - types with disk ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fraczevol2 ] ) , consistent with detailed analyzes of the @xmath20 universe .",
    "overall , not only are early - type galaxies at and above the @xmath69 mass scale assembled before their lower mass counterparts , but also their morphological evolution appears to be already stabilized by @xmath17 ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the hubble sequence at the highest masses is not only qualitatively , but also quantitatively in place already more than 8 gyr ago .",
    "possibly the simplest question to ask is whether the morphological distribution can be explained by galaxies growing stellar mass in - situ to migrate to a higher mass bin without modifying their morphologies .",
    "the simple answer is no , as found by estimating the mass that galaxies with @xmath70 will achieve if their best - fit star - formation histories are extrapolated from the epoch at which they are observed down to @xmath64 .",
    "internal star - formation since @xmath50 only results in a very modest increase ( @xmath71 ) in the stellar mass in galaxy types @xmath62 , @xmath61 and @xmath72 .",
    "bulge - less disk @xmath73 and irregular galaxies @xmath25 show , however , a non - negligible mass growth over the time span from @xmath50 to @xmath64 .",
    "the median growth for the bulge - less disk galaxies is @xmath74 ( 9 % ) in the lower ( higher ) mass bin .",
    "also , for galaxy types @xmath75 and @xmath72 , the fraction of galaxies that will have moved from the lower to the higher mass bin by @xmath53 , solely due to internal star - formation , is negligibly small ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "in contrast , a quarter of the bulge - less disk and a third of the irregular galaxy population is expected to migrate from the lower to the higher mass bin in the @xmath50 to @xmath53 time interval .",
    "it is particularly interesting that such a large fraction of pure disk galaxies ( @xmath73 ) is expected to migrate to the higher mass bin by @xmath53 , given that essentially none of these high mass objects are found in the cosmos data .",
    "this indicates that the growth of stellar mass in this class of objects must be accompanied by morphological transformations and migration to a different morphological bin .    physical processes that can move galaxies from a late - type to an early - type morphology range from purely internal evolution to mergers with other galaxies .",
    "a first - order quantification of the role of mergers in morphological transformations can be obtained assuming that galaxy morphologies are changed exclusively by merger events in a @xmath77-cdm cosmology .",
    "we use the code of @xcite to generate merger trees over the redshift interval @xmath78 ( matching the centers of our observational redshift bins ) and populate the corresponding halos with galaxies of given masses and morphologies , in order to trace the redshift evolution of their stellar mass content and morphology .",
    "each halo is populated by only one galaxy ( i.e. , we neglect substructure for this order of magnitude estimate ) . the conversion from dark matter halo mass to galaxy stellar mass",
    "is computed by matching the cumulative halo mass function @xcite with our total galaxy stellar mass function , as measured in the cosmos survey , averaged from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "this conversion is well fit by a double power law ( see also e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath79,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with best - fit parameters @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . over the mass range of our study",
    ", this conversion is in good agreement with the relation between the virial mass of dark matter halos and the stellar mass of the galaxies in the cosmos mock catalogs of @xcite .",
    "galaxies are assigned an initial morphological class at the start of the merger tree evolution , i.e. , in the highest redshift bin .",
    "this is done statistically , according to the measured fractions of morphological types in the given mass bin ( fig [ fig : fraczevol2 ] ) .",
    "as the merger trees evolve , morphological transformations are allowed according to a simple two parameter model : the first parameter sets the smallest mass ratio of merging galaxies which can produce a morphological transformation , @xmath86 . specifically , any galaxy which undergoes a merger between two progenitor galaxies with stellar masses in a ratio @xmath87 is attributed either the morphology of a bulge - dominated disk galaxy ( @xmath61 type ) or of an elliptical galaxy ( @xmath62 type ) .",
    "the probability that such a descendant galaxy is an @xmath62 galaxy is our second free parameter , @xmath88 .",
    "we run a large grid of @xmath88 and @xmath86 models , encompassing the range of values which are likely to be reasonable for these two uncertain quantities .",
    "the results are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : modnew2 ] for the three earlier galaxy types , @xmath62 , @xmath61 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the shaded areas show the region of parameter space that is covered by the entire range of explored @xmath86 and @xmath88 models . in the highest mass bin , a self - consistent best - fit model to all morphological types",
    "can be found which is described by @xmath89 ( solid lines ) .",
    "thus , in this model , 60% of all transformations from late to early type result in bulge dominated galaxies with a non - negligible disk component ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the model also reasonably reproduces the evolution of the later @xmath73 and @xmath25 galaxy types , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : modnew1 ] .     and @xmath91 , respectively . the data from fig .",
    "[ fig : fraczevol2 ] are shown with large dots and errorbars .",
    "all models coincide with the data by construction in the highest redshift bin . evolving towards lower redshifts , galaxies which undergo a merger event",
    "acquire an early - type @xmath62 or @xmath61 morphology when the stellar mass ratio of their progenitors is larger than @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath88 is the fraction of such mergers which end up producing an @xmath62 morphology .",
    "solid lines in the right panels ( for @xmath92@xmath15 ) show the self - consistent best - fit solution to all galaxy types in this mass bin , provided by @xmath93 and @xmath94 . at lower masses , the best fit solution ( dashed line )",
    "would be @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "however , such low mass mergers are not expected to induce a significant morphological evolution and additionally , they can not explain the disappearance of pure disk galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : modnew1 ] ) . ]    .",
    "the self - consistent evolutionary tracks to all morphological types which best approximate the observed data points are shown as solid / dashed lines in the two different mass bins . note the failure of the hierarchical models to reproduce the evolutionary trends observed at stellar masses @xmath97@xmath15 , even with stellar mass ratios of the merging progenitors down to 1/20 . ]    however , no model can reasonably fit the observed data points for all morphological types simultaneously in the lower mass bin ( see left panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : modnew1 ] and [ fig : modnew2 ] ) .",
    "that is , the models can not explain the growth in the @xmath62 and @xmath61 populations _ and _ the decline of the later - type populations since @xmath98 , even when including minor mergers with mass fractions as low as 1/20",
    ". one clear feature that is observable in the modeled trends is the increasingly more substantial over - production of bulge - less disks as cosmic time proceeds .",
    "we speculate that , in a hierarchical universe in which mergers are bound to occur , bulge - less disk galaxies additionally undergo bulge - building morphological transformations due to internal , secular evolution processes ( possibly also triggered by the hierarchical accretion activity ) .",
    "secular evolution is strongly suggested by many independent studies of the @xmath20 disk galaxy population ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and also kormendy & kennicutt 2004 for a comprehensive list of references on this subject ) .",
    "we thus expect secular - evolution driven migration of bulge - less disk galaxies into earlier types @xmath72 ( or even @xmath61 ) , which may alleviate the discrepancy between our simple but realistic merger model and our observational results in the cosmos field",
    ". note that in a numerical study based on the millennium simulation @xcite similarly found merger rates to be too low to account for the inferred morphological transformations that build early - type galaxies .",
    "our analysis shows that the evolution of the morphological distribution in galaxies since @xmath17 depends strongly on stellar mass , with little or no evolution at mass scales above @xmath99 @xmath15  and detectable evolutionary trends at lower masses ( @xmath100 @xmath15 ) .    at @xmath17 between @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    ", there exists a non - negligible fraction ( 15% ) of bulge - less disk galaxies .",
    "their relative abundance decreases rapidly towards lower redshift , essentially disappearing by @xmath103 .",
    "in contrast with all other main types , these bulge - less systems grow considerable amounts of stellar mass since @xmath17 through internal star - formation .    at all masses above our completeness limit , the early - type population grows in importance towards lower redshifts .",
    "interestingly , we find that this growth is dominated by galaxies containing a non - negligible disk component . although traditionally grouped together into the single class of _ early - type _ galaxies , the disk - less spheroids ( i.e. , elliptical galaxies , @xmath62 ) and massive bulges embedded in a non - dominant disk component ( the @xmath61 galaxies in our paper ) most likely have a different origin . in the simple - minded framework in which late - type galaxies are directly transformed into ` early - type ' galaxies , about @xmath104% of such transformations result in bulge - dominated @xmath61-type disk galaxies .",
    "the physical mechanisms responsible for these late - to-@xmath61 transformations must be capable of building or retaining a dynamically - cold component and different mechanisms must be at play in the remaining @xmath105 of cases in order to produce the disk - less @xmath62 galaxies .    at mass scales above @xmath16@xmath15",
    ", a simple but robust merger - tree model can reproduce the redshift evolution of the mass fraction of galaxies of all morphological types simultaneously : mergers with stellar mass ratios down to 1/4 can , without any need of invocation of more complex scenarios , reproduce the morphological mix at @xmath106 at the high end of the galactic mass scales , where the bulgeless disk galaxies are only a negligible contribution .",
    "in contrast , at mass scales below @xmath107@xmath15 , neither the evolution of the fractions of early type populations ( @xmath62 and @xmath61 ) , nor that of the bulge - less disks , can be reproduced within a @xmath77-cdm hierarchical picture including only mergers as the responsible mechanism for morphological transformations .",
    "most prominently , the disappearance of the bulge - disk galaxies is not explained by mergers of any mass ratio , down to small accretion events .",
    "global disk dynamical instabilities are thus likely to be active in building bulge components through inward transfer of mass ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thereby adding substantial stellar mass while also inducing the galaxy to migrate to an earlier - type morphological class .",
    "secular evolution thus appears to be key towards achieving a complete recipe for the formation of the @xmath20 hubble sequence at mass scales below @xmath107 @xmath15 .",
