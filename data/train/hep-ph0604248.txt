    "besides the description of hard elastic reactions , gpds give access to the orbital momentum of partons in the nucleon @xcite and 3-dimensional nucleon structure @xcite .",
    "the importance of gpds for understanding of the nucleon structure raised a problem of their extraction from hard elastic scattering data , first of all from deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .",
    "the activity of measuring dvcs observables at lepton - nucleon facilities is quite intense @xcite .",
    "similar to pdfs , gpds are subject of perturbative qcd evolution which should be taken care of in extraction of gpds from the data on lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "the lo kernels for gpds evolution are well - known @xcite .",
    "the nlo results have been published @xcite . at present",
    ", there exists a code @xcite which can be used for leading and next - to - leading order evolution of gpds .",
    "however , on a 1.7 ghz pentium-4 machine this code takes about 15 seconds for lo evolution and about 40 seconds for the nlo which is not fast enough for performing fitting procedure requiring very large number of evolution routine calls .",
    "evolution equations for gpds at the lo can be also solved by a decomposition of gpds in series of special functions @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it does not require introduction of a difference scheme for @xmath7 .",
    "however , the decomposition is not trivial for numerical implementation and the number of terms in the series required to achieve a reliable precision can be large ( depending on the input gpds ) .    in the present paper another code",
    "is introduced , which does the lo gpd evolution with a reasonable precision for @xmath8 seconds , making possible its usage for fitting .",
    "the fast work was achieved by optimization of the computational procedure .",
    "it uses 4-th order runge - kutta method for solving the evolution equations . since in the broad dglap region ( @xmath9 )",
    "the variation of gpds is not sizable , and in the narrow erbl region ( @xmath10 ) is quite significant , the convolution integrals are performed on a logarithmic grid so that the number of points in erbl and dglap regions is the same .",
    "the code itself is also optimized .",
    "for example , the operation of division is avoided as much as possible .",
    "this was done since division on the machines commonly used ( such as pentium - iv ) is performed 6 times slower than multiplication .",
    "so , if an expression to be computed reads @xmath11 , its optimized version is @xmath12 .",
    "since the nlo expressions are considerably larger then the lo ones , their implementation is not done at the moment .",
    "the lo kernels for gpds evolution are well - known . in the code",
    "those published in @xcite are used .",
    "the numerical computation of the evolution requires that singularities in the kernel to be cancelled analytically .",
    "the kernels with regularized singularities in the form they take in the code are given in the appendix .",
    "the kernels assume the definition of the gpds given in @xcite . in the forward limit",
    "they obey @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "note that quark singlet and non - singlet densities are not divided by @xmath20 .",
    "this is important in the singlet sector , where non - diagonal parts of the kernel depend on the normalization of the quark singlet distribution . for non - singlet channel ,",
    "isovector combination was chosen to represent the work of the code .",
    "it is clear that any other non - singlet combination of gpds can be taken as well .    in the singlet sector , the symmetry properties @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are used .",
    "this allowed to reduce the computational time by a factor of 4 .",
    "thus , the singlet kernels are given only for @xmath25 .",
    "for all parts of the kernel , convolution at @xmath26 was done separately .",
    "the kernels at @xmath27 were taken as @xmath28 limits of the corresponding dglap or ( equivalently for @xmath29 ) erbl expressions .",
    "the running strong coupling constant is taken as a solution of the nlo rg equation @xmath30 where the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the number of active quark flavors . the initial condition for eq .",

    "note that the number of active flavors @xmath42 entering the @xmath43 rg equation is different from the number of flavors in the proton @xmath20 which enters into the quark - gluon evolution kernel . in the code",
    ", @xmath20 is always equal to 3 .",
    "the integrals are computed on a logarithmic grid .",
    "the required parameterization for non - singlet case reads : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 this grid has the following useful properties : @xmath48 i.e. it provides the same level of detalization for erbl and dglap regions .    for the singlet case the grid size",
    "is reduced so that to cover only @xmath49 interval : @xmath50 so that @xmath51 the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the same as in the non - singlet case ( eq .  [ lngridpar ] ) .",
    "after introduction of the logarithmic grid the convolution integrals can be computed using the standard equidistant simpson s formula taking into account the jacobian for the grid : @xmath52 the @xmath53 uncertainty in the integrals can be resolved with the lhopital s rule . since for the numerical integration the simpson s @xmath54 method is used , the numerical computation of the derivative requires @xmath55 precision . depending on the position of the singularity ( availability of other grid points on the left and on the right ) ,",
    "one of the following formulas is be used : @xmath56 for @xmath57 the denominator should be replaced by @xmath58 .    to verify the convolution code ,",
    "a computation was done for a simple functional form gpds . for the non - singlet",
    ", spin - independent quark - gluon and gluon - gluon parts and spin - dependent quark - quark and gluon - quark parts @xmath59 was taken , and for singlet spin - independent quark - quark and gluon - quark parts and spin - dependent quark - gluon and gluon - gluon parts @xmath60 it was found that taking @xmath61 provides 4 - 6 digits precision for all the integrals .",
    "it should be noted that the test functions are not convenient for the simpson method calculation since in the logarithmic grid they fall steeply when @xmath62 .",
    "however , they made possible analytical computation of the integrals and therefore they were used in the test . the real gpds which fall rapidly as @xmath63 should be computed with use of simpson s method more precisely on such a grid .",
    "basing on the integrals obtained in the previous section , the code for gpd evolution was written .",
    "it is based on the 4-th order runge - kutta method .",
    "indeed , after introduction of the grid ( [ lngrid ] ) the convolution integrals are transformed into sums .",
    "therefore , the integro - differential evolution equation is transformed into a set of @xmath64 ordinary differential equations of the form instead of 0 to @xmath65 in the non - singlet sector . ]",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "the 4-th order runge - kutta scheme on the @xmath68-grid with @xmath69 nodes @xmath70 therefore reads : @xmath71 where through @xmath72 @xmath73    the results of the computation are presented in figs .",
    "[ figns]-[figg_pol ] for typical kinematics of hermes and hera .",
    "the code works both in forward ( from smaller to larger @xmath7 ) and backward ( from larger to smaller @xmath7 ) directions .",
    "as it can be seen , choice of @xmath74 and @xmath75 already gives satisfactory results .",
    "distinctions from the careful solution with @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be noticed around @xmath78 , but they are much smaller then typical experimental errors , so the choice of @xmath74 , @xmath75 can be recommended for time - consuming fitting procedures .",
    "if the time limitations are not very strict , larger number of @xmath79 and @xmath69 can be taken providing higher precision .",
    "the evolution procedure was checked for satisfying the momentum conservation sum rule @xmath80 and flavor conservation sum rule @xmath81 for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , the sum rules are satisfied within 0.01% accuracy at hermes kinematics and 0.5% accuracy at hera kinematics .",
    "computational time depends on @xmath79 and @xmath69 as @xmath82 where @xmath69 is the number of intervals for @xmath83 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath84 depends on the computational power of the machine . for pentium - iv 1.7 ghz @xmath85 sec in the non - singlet case and @xmath86 @xmath87 in the singlet case .",
    "this means that computation of evolution with @xmath79=20 , @xmath69=1 takes about @xmath88 sec .",
    "even though the code is quite effective , instabilities stemming from the complicate structure of the kernels still arise in the output .",
    "so far , only one instability was found .",
    "it is related to the fact that due to the `` + '' regularization procedure the convolution integral at a given value of @xmath0 depends to a large extent on the value of derivative of the gpd at this point .",
    "therefore , if an input gpd has sudden spikes ( not related to a possible semi - singular behavior at @xmath78 which the code can handle ) , the code can amplify them .",
    "this type of instability is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ instab ] .",
    "the problem occurs only in the gluon - gluon part of the kernel and only for evolution in the backward direction , _",
    "i.e. _ from larger @xmath7 to smaller one .",
    "it should be noted that the smaller is the step in @xmath0 , the bigger is the value of the derivative the sudden spikes produce .",
    "therefore , when for some reason the task is to perform evolution with very high precision , the stability of the input gpds must be taken care of .",
    "a code for prompt numerical computation of leading order gpds evolution is presented .",
    "its fundamentals are computation of the convolution integrals on a logarithmic grid and 4-th order runge - kutta method for integration of the differential equations .",
    "the code makes possible fast computation of the gpd evolution . on a 1.7 ghz pentium-4 machine",
    "computational time required to perform evolution in the @xmath7 range from 4 to 1 gev@xmath89 or from 4 to 40 gev@xmath89 is of order of 10@xmath90 seconds .",
    "such code makes possible fitting of gpds parameters from data on hard elastic lepton - nucleon reactions .",
    "this work from the very beginning would be impossible without guidance of m.  diehl .",
    "his advise also made the code more stable and effective .",
    "the author is grateful to w .- d .",
    "nowak for permanent support and useful discussions .",
    "the work was supported by the alexander von humboldt foundation and in part by rfbr grant 04 - 02 - 16445 .",
    "after cancellation of the singularities thanks to the `` + '' operation the kernels are ready for practical usage . at @xmath91",
    "the non - singlet part of the evolution equation reads : @xmath92 \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at @xmath93 : @xmath94 \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath95 : @xmath96 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]          in this part and also in the gluon - gluon part of the kernel a pole at @xmath99 must be regularized . for this",
    ", subtraction of the @xmath100 is done .",
    "if @xmath101 is subtracted instead , this lead to larger of inaccuracy of the simpson s method since the function @xmath102 varies very rapidly around @xmath103 .            for the pure gluonic part it was found that simple subtraction of the gpd value at @xmath103 does not provide high enough precision . to overcome the difficulty , a partial fractioning was introduced so that integrand in each of the integrals had only one pole ( at @xmath103 or @xmath99 ) .",
    "this brought formal complication into the evolution kernel .",
    "however , practical numerical calculations became more stable and precise .",
    "as it was in the case of the spin - independent gluon - gluon kernel , the spin - dependent gluon - gluon kernel requires partial fractioning of the denominator so that each of the integrals would have only only one pole , which can be easily handled by subtraction .",
