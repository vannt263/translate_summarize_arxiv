    "<S> one of the first attempts to incorporate steric effects is the _ stern layer </S>",
    "<S> _ modification @xcite of the pb approach . </S>",
    "<S> steric effects are introduced by excluding the ions from the first molecular layer close to the surface . </S>",

    "<S> more recent modifications @xcite rely either on monte carlo computer simulations or on numerical solutions of integral equations ( the `` hypernetted chain '' equation @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> these approaches involve elaborate numerical calculations and lack the simplicity of the original pb approach .    in this letter , we propose a simple way to include steric effects in the original pb approach . </S>",
    "<S> this modified pb equation clearly shows how ionic saturation takes place close to a charged surface . </S>",
    "<S> the equation is derived for 1:@xmath0 asymmetric and @xmath0:@xmath0 symmetric electrolytes . at low ionic concentration , the original pb equation is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> simple analytical relations between the surface charge density and the counterion concentration at the surface are obtained , in agreement with recent experiments @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the first two terms are the entropies of the positive and negative ions , whereas the last term is the entropy of the solvent molecules . indeed , this last term is responsible for the novel steric corrections to the pb equation . in a more rigorous way , </S>",
    "<S> these corrections are obtained by considering a lattice - gas version of the coulomb gas in which each lattice site is occupied at most by one ion @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> our approach deviates significantly from the original pb equation for large electrostatic potentials @xmath29 . </S>",

    "<S> the main effect is the saturation of the ionic concentration in the vicinity of the charged surface . </S>",
    "<S> this should be contrasted with the original pb scheme which leads to extremely high and unphysical values of @xmath35 , especially for multivalent ions . in the saturated region </S>",

    "<S> the pb case is shown as well for comparison . at low surface charge @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> , the ion concentration reduces to the pb results @xmath48 but for high surface charge @xmath49 , the deviations from the pb case are substantial . furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from the above equation , the ionic concentration near the surface depends only weakly on the bulk electrolyte concentration , @xmath3 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b the ratio between the ion charge density of the first layer @xmath50 and @xmath51 is plotted as function of the specific surface area per unit charge , as is often measured in experiments . for the pb approach , </S>",
    "<S> this ratio diverges at high surface charge densities ( small specific area ) because @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our case , the steric effect changes the situation altogether since it prevents the ions from approaching and over - compensating the surface charges .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results presented here are relevant to recent experiments @xcite where large multivalent ions are adsorbed onto a charged langmuir monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> large polyanions such as h@xmath53pw@xmath54o@xmath55 ( phosphotungstic acid ) dissolved in an aqueous subphase are attracted to a cationic langmuir monolayer such as a fatty amine surfactant ( c@xmath56h@xmath57-nh@xmath58 ) , spread at the water / air interface . the adsorbed ion density ( per unit area ) in the solution , @xmath59 , is measured by x - ray reflectivity . </S>",
    "<S> it is then related to the surface charge density @xmath51 , which is controlled by langmuir trough . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments show very clearly the presence of the steric effects for these large ions ( of estimated size of 10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the surface charge density increases , @xmath60 decreases in accord with our findings ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) and in contrast to the original pb approach .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have derived a modified pb equation including steric effects . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the ionic concentration can not exceed a saturation value of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is in particular important for large ions adsorbing on charged surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained analytical expressions for the potential and ion concentrations at the surface . </S>",
    "<S> our results differ qualitatively and quantitatively from the standard pb equation and agree with recent experiments on large polyions in solution </S>",
