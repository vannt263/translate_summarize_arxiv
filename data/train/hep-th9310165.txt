    "two - dimensional yang - mills theory is quite a trivial example of a quantum field theory , since it has no propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , the study of different gauge invariant quantities shows quite a rich structure and can be viewed as a useful tool for the verification of mathematical hypotheses about the corresponding theory in physically relevant dimension ; say , for the search of a string theory describing multicolour qcd .",
    "as was demonstrated in @xcite on the example of wilson loops , and in @xcite on the example of partition functions on the compact two - dimensional manifolds , the results can be represented in terms of a sum over minimal coverings ( `` soap films '' ) spanned on a contour , or wrapping over the closed manifold . in this respect , the theory can have a beautiful mathematical application , as was the case with the application of three - dimensional chern - simons gauge theory .",
    "first we shall consider a simple loop on a sphere , separating areas @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with which a holonomy @xmath4 is associated .",
    "the average over all possible gauge fields inside and outside the loop gives the partition function of corresponding discs with fixed holonomies @xmath4 and @xmath5 around the boundary , each given by the heat kernel ( on the group ) @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the laplacian on @xmath0 , with characters as eigenfunctions :    @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the quadratic casimir of the irreducible representation @xmath11 .",
    "the character expansion of @xmath12 reads : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of occurrences of @xmath15 in @xmath16 , that is : @xmath17 when the young diagram of @xmath15 is obtained by adding one box to the diagram of @xmath18 or @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "now , if the rows in the first diagram have lengths @xmath20 , the corresponding dimension is @xmath21 and the casimir @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "if the @xmath24 row can be added a box , the dimension is multiplied by @xmath25 and the casimir changes according to @xmath26    we use the notation @xmath27 and @xmath28 its large n limit : @xmath29 ; we have to compute @xmath30 where the sum over @xmath31 corresponds to all possible ways of adding one box to the diagram .",
    "this is the expectation value @xmath32 computed through averaging over all possible young diagrams with the same weights as those which appear in the partition function of a sphere with total area @xmath33 ; but in @xcite has been found the shape of the most probable diagrams : if @xmath34 corresponds to a line to which a box can be added , we have @xmath35 and we can solve for @xmath36 , obtaining a semi - circle law ] if @xmath37 or an expression involving the complete elliptic integral of the third kind when @xmath38 or @xmath39 when @xmath40 , with @xmath41 . ] if @xmath42 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , as the same weight is given to any representation and to its conjugate ( represented by @xmath43 ) , the unique solution for @xmath44 is symmetric : @xmath45 , and corresponds to ( pseudo-)real representations .    in a similar way",
    ", we can average over @xmath15 and sum over all possible ways of suppressing one box , so that @xmath12 is also given by the average @xmath46    we turn to the computation of @xmath47 where the @xmath48 s are distributed according to the above - mentioned law , with fluctuations of order 1 .",
    "when @xmath49 is far apart from @xmath31 ( @xmath50 of order @xmath1 ) , the logarithm is of order @xmath51 , and there are @xmath1 such terms : these give a finite contribution to the sum .",
    "but the same is true for those @xmath49 s that are close to @xmath31 : there are a few such terms , each of order one , and one has to take them into account , adding their contribution to the ( principal value ) integral which accounts for the terms of the first kind : @xmath52 .",
    "note that the latter terms were discarded in the computation of the shape of the most probable diagrams : looking for a maximum of @xmath53 with its continuous formulation really means looking for a diagram with maximal weight with respect to long - wavelength perturbations ( @xmath54 but for few @xmath31 s , far apart from one another ) , in which case the contribution we are going to consider vanishes ; while here it does not , because we consider a short - wavelength perturbation @xmath55 .",
    "so , the solution of @xcite has to be understood in this way , and we have to consider the contributions of all the `` most probable '' diagrams , which differ from one another through short - wavelength fluctuations .",
    "as the integers @xmath48 have independent fluctuations of order 1 , it seems reasonable to replace @xmath56 ( for @xmath57 of order 1 ) by its continuous approximation @xmath58 , which is : @xmath59 in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "thus , the contribution to the sum of logarithms is @xmath60 if we introduce @xmath61 ( @xmath62 bernoulli number ) , and use the characterization of the most probable distribution , we obtain : @xmath63\\ ] ] noting that @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath67 ; starting from an average over @xmath15 , and considering all possible ways of suppressing one box , we would obtain the same expression with @xmath3 and @xmath2 interchanged : indeed , the sign of @xmath68 does not matter as the even distribution @xmath69 has only even moments .",
    "what about the sum over all acceptable lines ? defining @xmath70 to be @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , we see that if @xmath73 , generically we have @xmath74 and all lines are likely to be extended .",
    "however , if @xmath75 , there is a finite fraction of lines for which @xmath76 , and the non - increasing condition on the @xmath77 s prevents a finite fraction of lines from being extended . in this case",
    ", the contribution of @xmath78 in the range @xmath79 is @xmath80 .",
    "finally , we would expect : @xmath81    however , as boulatov first noticed @xcite , one has to be careful in expressing the product @xmath82 in terms of the continuous function @xmath44 , when @xmath75 . in this case , he groups factors in packets and obtains a continuous approximation to @xmath83 which is the same as the preceding one , but for a factor @xmath84 that compensates for the @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath75 , fluctuations of lengths of the rows are prevented by the non - increasing condition on the @xmath77 s : this is the very reason why a direct continuous approximation is not valid .",
    "we shall rather consider the heights of the columns , which are free to fluctuate , so that the argument given above for lines gets transposed .",
    "when @xmath75 , generically we have : @xmath86 , so columns are labelled by @xmath87 ; summing over all possible additions of one box means summing over all @xmath87 s . just as in the preceding case , the change in the casimir is @xmath88 ; as for dimensions , the contribution of @xmath49 s far apart from @xmath31 reduces to the exponential of the same principal value integral , recognized as @xmath89 . to study the contribution of @xmath49 s close to @xmath31 we consider a truncated diagram , formed with a finite number of lines extending above and under @xmath31 ; let @xmath90 denote the height of the @xmath91 truncated column ( @xmath92 ) and set @xmath93 .",
    "how does the dimension change when we add a box at the end of line @xmath31 , that is at the bottom of column @xmath94 ?    before the extension , @xmath95 contains all integers ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath96 but the @xmath97 .",
    "similarly , the product @xmath98 evaluates to @xmath99 .",
    "after the extension these factors are respectively @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so that : @xmath102 ( we have just expressed the ( change in ) dimension in terms of heights of columns for `` steep '' diagrams : @xmath103 ) .",
    "the last factor goes to 1 for large truncated diagrams , extending _ symmetrically _ around @xmath31 ( use @xmath104 for large @xmath1 , and note that this symmetry corresponds to the cancellation of @xmath105 in ( [ eq.zeta ] ) and to the identification of the other terms with a principal value integral ) .    finally , arguing that the heights of columns are integers with fluctuations of order 1 , and can be approximated by a continuous function , we apply the same computation as before to get : @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "this is exactly : @xmath108    the same result was independently obtained by boulatov @xcite .",
    "before showing how the loop equations @xcite allow us to compute self - intersecting wilson loops , we cast ( [ eqgale ] ) into a more convenient form for later purposes .",
    "define @xmath109 : if @xmath34 lies in the support of @xmath69 and is such that @xmath110 ( @xmath34 corresponds to a region where boxes can be added ) we have @xmath111 with @xmath112 the total area ; if @xmath113 then @xmath114 vanishes .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath115 where the contour of integration goes around the cut of @xmath116 in the positive direction",
    ".    other loops can be easily obtained by the methods of @xcite and expressed as contour integrals .",
    "consider for instance the following case : the associated wilson average @xmath117 satisfies @xmath118 , where we note @xmath119 for a simple loop enclosing area @xmath31 and @xmath120 for derivation with respect to area @xmath31 ( the total area @xmath112 being kept fixed ) .",
    "we now integrate this equation to obtain : @xmath121 indeed , we have just seen that both sides vary by the same quantity when the areas 1 and 2 are changed by the same amount ; so , we only have to check that they coincide when one of the areas vanishes .",
    "suppose @xmath122 : the left - hand side of ( [ huit ] ) reduces to @xmath123 , and in the right - hand side , we use @xmath124 for @xmath125 to compute the residue at infinity of the @xmath126 integral , and find @xmath123 again .",
    "so,([huit ] ) holds provided the smallest area is associated with the outer contour . but contours can be interchanged : the difference between the integral with @xmath126 on the outer contour and the one with @xmath126 on the inner contour is given by the ( sum of ) residue(s ) at @xmath127 ( for each value of @xmath34 ) , that is @xmath128 that is 0 , because @xmath116 is an odd function .",
    "we conclude that contours can be interchanged : their relative position does not matter , provided they do not intersect ( more properly : @xmath129 shall not vanish ; otherwise , the double integral is still convergent , but it does not give the right answer ) .    as another example",
    ", we consider the pochhammer contour for which the loop equations give : @xmath130 so that @xmath131 and @xmath132 we take @xmath133 to compute @xmath134 : in this case the pochhammer contour reduces to an 8-like loop ( @xmath135 ) , and @xmath136    finally , we have : @xmath137 ( here again , the relative position of contours is arbitrary : we only require @xmath129 not to vanish ) or @xmath138 .",
    "when the total area @xmath139 is less than @xmath140 , the density @xmath69 obeys a semi - circle law @xcite : @xmath141 so that ( [ eqgale ] ) gives : @xmath142        apparently , windings ( that is , periodicity for @xmath144 s ) can be neglected consistently provided the support of @xmath69 does nt extend out of @xmath147 $ ] , which is the case as long as @xmath148 ; in particular , one of the areas can be arbitrarily large .",
    "however , this is not the case with the derivation here given : the total area has to be less than @xmath140 for the semi - circle law to be valid ; and , for one large area , boulatov @xcite checked the exponential law : indeed , he could reproduce the large - area expansion given by gross and taylor s prescriptions @xcite .",
