    "the total overlap of all the rpa excitations below 30 mev is 1.46 .",
    "thus , the low- and high - lying excitations exhaust 53% and 38% of the total overlap with the scissors state , respectively .",
    "let us note that the total overlap is exactly 100% for a vanishig isovector interaction @xcite .",
    "the isoscalar channel cancels the spurious ( isoscalar ) admixtures , but it does not contribute to the ( purely isovector ) scissors mode .",
    "thus , an overlap of 100% is produced by the mean field alone .",
    "the overlap is not conserved in rpa since it corresponds to a non e.w .",

    "a synthetic state is constructed for each rpa excitation by rotating out - of - phase neutron and proton configurations weighted with the rpa amplitudes of this excitation . a large overlap of a given rpa state with its synthetic counterpart is an indication for an isovector rotational motion , irrespectively of the low collectivity caused by the fragmentation .",
    "the strongest ( low - energy orbital ) m1 excitation overlaps usually 8090% with its synthetic counterpart @xcite . in contrast , no one of the strongest orbital states at high energy ( around 22 mev in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) overlaps more than 7% with its synthetic counterpart .",
    "the coherence is restored in the schematic single excitation at 22 mev in the lower plot : it overlaps almost 90% with its synthetic counterpart , confirming the presence of the scissors mode at high - energy .",
    "it is clear from the above considerations that the scissors mode fragments over both the low- and high - energy orbital m1 excitations .",
    "this holds exactly for the isovector rotational model @xcite , formulated in the schematic two - level basis of the quantized deformed oscillator .",
    "it was found within this model that the scissors mode exhausts the whole non - spurious orbital m1 strength at low and high energy , corresponding to excitations with @xmath92 = 0,2 , respectively .",

    "[ fig3 ] is four times larger than the value 1.5 @xmath95 , listed in the last row of table  i. the difference is due to the fact that @xmath96dy , considered in @xcite , has a very small deformation , producing less orbital m1 strength than the well - deformed @xmath40gd , studied in the present work .",

    "components in the corresponding rpa wave functions are neutrons with @xmath3 = 4 in the former state and protons with @xmath102 = 0 in the latter state .",
    "thus , the former excitation has a more pronounced volume character than the latter one .",
    "in addition to the above two strongest excitations at high energy we consider also the two next strongest high - energy orbital m1 excitations from the upper plot of fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "these four excitations lie between 20.5 and 23 mev , have a summed @xmath103 value 0.73 @xmath88 , and a summed overlap with the scissors state 11% .",

    "[ fig5 ] that even in backward scattering the cross section is one order of magnitude larger for e2 than for m1 excitations .",
    "the displayed cross sections are calculated for @xmath104 , an angle often used in experiments , but we have checked that the same e2 dominance is present even at a fully backward angle .",
    "this result is particularly interesting in view of the well - known expectation @xcite for a strong enhancement of m1 over e2 excitations in backward scattering .",
    "such a qualitative expectation is based on approximations ( negligible excitation energy compared to the incident electron energy , pwba ) , which do not hold for the dwba cross section of the high - energy excitation , dispayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the experimental resolution of single m1 excitations is hindered furthermore by the strong fragmentation at high energy .",
    "one should expect , therefore , that above 17 mev the experimental cross section of inelastically scattered electrons will originate almost exclusively from the e2 ivgqr and not from m1 transitions .",
    "in contrast , at low energy the m1 cross section dominates over the e2 cross section @xcite , at least for low transferred momenta .",
    "the high - lying m1 strength is almost purely orbital .",
    "it resides in the same energy region as the isovector e2 strength ( ivgqr ) .",
    "experimental data on the ivgqr in heavy deformed nuclei are scarce .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath1 spectra rely on a rough estimate of the expected excitation energy of this resonance , based on the collective model .",
    "the main uncertainty arises from the poorly known isovector potential , which determines also the magnitude of the isovector coupling in the residual spin - independent interaction , used in microscopic calculations .",
    "we have adopted here a ratio @xmath75 between the isovector and isoscalar coupling constants .",

    ", the isoscalar coupling gives rise to an isoscalar gqr at 11 mev with @xmath80 , in agreement with experiment .",
    "the adopted isovector ratio , @xmath75 , produces in rpa an ivgqr whose @xmath39-component is centered at about 22 mev , but strongly fragmented over the interval 1725 mev .",
    "thus , even the strongest m1 transition from this region has a relatively small @xmath103 value , 0.25 @xmath88 , in comparison with the strong low - lying orbital excitations .",
    "the high - lying strengths , summed in the above interval , are @xmath105 .",
    "the total rpa energy - weighted e2 strength exhausts exactly the classical sum rule for @xmath49 .",
    "the scissors mode is found to fragment over both the low- and high - energy orbital m1 excitations .",
    "although the latter are more collective , the coherence of the scissors motion is destroyed at high energy by the increased fragmentation , due not only to the high level density , but also to the rotational invariance .",
    "most of the strongly fragmented high - lying orbital excitations ( 1725 mev ) are not performing well - pronounced rotational vibrations .",
    "this is seen from their small overlap with synthetic states , where such a geometrical motion is enforced by construction .",
    "nevertheless , the orbital excitations from the above high - energy region have all together a large overlap , 55% , with the collective scissors state constructed from the deformed mean field . the 1@xmath90 excitations below 9 mev overlap 77% with the scissors state .",
    "the total scissors overlap of all the rpa excitations below 30 mev is 1.46 .",
    "the excess above unity is produced by the isovector coupling , corresponding to a stronger attractive neutron - proton interaction , which enhances the scissors motion .",
    "the recent canonical quantization of the isovector rotor in relative conjugate variables @xcite provides simple analytical results in the deformed oscillator basis .",
    "they strongly support the interpretation of all the orbital m1 strength , at both low and high energies , as manifestation of the fragmented collective scissors mode .",
    "the @xmath1 cross sections of 1@xmath90 states above 17 mev originate mainly from e2 excitations even for backward scattering , while the contributions of the high - lying orbital m1 excitations to these cross sections are typically one order of magnitude smaller .",
