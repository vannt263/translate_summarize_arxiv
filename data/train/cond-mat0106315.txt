    "the original treatments of the influence of magnetic and non  magnetic disorder on superconductors applied to classic bcs superconductors @xcite , has been reexamined for superconductors with @xmath0wave symmetry of order parameter @xcite . on the other hand , in high temperature superconductors the distance between the chemical potential and van hove singularity",
    "was found to be relatively small .",
    "this has lead to formulation of van hove scenario for high temperature superconductors which says that optimal critical temperature is reached when chemical potential passes through the van hove singularity in the density of states @xcite .",
    "however , doping with charge carriers does not only change the density in the system but also smear the density of states eliminating its singularities and , specially for anisotropic superconductors , introduce the electron pair  breaking phenomenon @xcite .",
    "we start with the single band hubbard model with an attractive extended interaction which is described by the following hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath2    in the above @xmath3 is the charge on site labeled @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the chemical potential .",
    "disorder is introduced into the problem by allowing the local site energy @xmath6 to vary randomly from site to site , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the fermion creation and annihilation operators for an electron on site @xmath4 with spin @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the amplitude for hopping from site @xmath11 to site @xmath4 and finally @xmath12 is the attractive interaction ( @xmath13 ) , between electrons on neighbour sites ( @xmath14 ) .",

    ", @xmath20 denotes the boltzmann constant , @xmath21 is an averaged electron green function which defines the weighted density of states ( dos ) of @xmath0-wave electron states @xmath22 : @xmath23 @xmath24 describes the electron self energy in the normal disordered system and @xmath25 .",
    "examples of projected densities of states @xmath26 for disordered 2d system stem are presented in fig . 1a while the corresponding self energies are plotted in fig .",

    "analyzing the effect of disorder on disordered @xmath0wave superconductor we have found the additional influence of the van hove singularity . in the presence of a weak disorder @xmath43",
