    "a remarkable discovery in recent years is that bifurcation in classical dynamics is related to quantum entanglement in the ground state of the corresponding quantum hamiltonian .",
    "in addition to its theoretical demonstration in the dicke model  @xcite , in a model of two coupled giant spins describing magnetic clusters  @xcite , and in an integrable dimer model @xcite , this association has also been studied in the area of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , including two - component bec @xcite and two - mode atomic - molecular bec @xcite .",
    "more recently , a classical bifurcation has been observed in an experiment realizing an internal josephson effect in a spinor bose - einstein condensate , as an important step toward entanglement generation close to critical points  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a laser - cooled atom , experimental evidence has been observed for entanglement being a quantum signature of chaos  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a novel kind of bec , the so - called ebec , that is , bec of interspecies spin singlet pairs , was found to be the ground state of a bose system composed of two species of pseudo - spin-@xmath0 bose atoms with both intraspecies and interspecies spin - exchange interactions in a considerable parameter regime @xcite . under the usual single orbital - mode approximation , the hamiltonian of this system can be transformed into that of two coupled giant spins .",
    "alas , the ground states in all parameter regimes have not yet worked out .    in this paper , we make each of the above two lines of research useful for the other .",
    "we focus on the case in the absence of an external potential .",
    "first , we study the bifurcation of the classical dynamics corresponding to the hamiltonian of this bose mixture , by analyzing the stability of each fixed point .",
    "quantum dynamics displays some features similar to the classical dynamics if the initial state is a disentangled state , which , however , is not an energy eigenstate .",
    "when the numbers of the atoms of the two species are equal , a bifurcation of the fixed points indeed corresponds to a quantum phase transition to a maximally entangled ground state .",
    "when they are unequal , the quantum state corresponding to the classical fixed point which bifurcates is also maximally entangled at the bifurcation point . however , it is not the ground state . finally , we analytically obtain all the quantum ground states by considering quantum fluctuations around the classical ground state in each parameter regime .",
