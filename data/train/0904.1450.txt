    "the leading order dipole approximation for the high energy processes in qcd developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , cf . also refs .",
    "@xcite , is the generalization of the pqcd improved parton model to the target rest frame description .",
    "the leading order dipole approximation provides the solution of the equations of qcd in the kinematics of fixed and small , but not too small @xmath3 and not very small @xmath2 .",
    "the main aim of the current paper is the study of the properties of the dis processes in the fragmentation region . in particular , we study two closely related properties of the wave function of the projectile .    first , we consider two properties of the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) wave function of the projectile : ( i ) we find the increase with energy ( 1/x ) of the transverse momenta ( @xmath4 ) of the quark(antiquark ) within the @xmath1 pair produced in the fragmentation region by the strongly virtual photon , ( ii ) we see the increase of the relative contribution of pqcd to the structure functions as compared to the soft qcd contribution at central impact parameters due to a rapid increase with energy of the cross section of interaction of small dipoles .",
    "we show that at sufficiently high energies the transverse momenta @xmath0 become larger than @xmath5 . as a result",
    "a new pqcd regime different from the conventional dglap @xcite , appears at these energies .",
    "the reason is that the ordering in transverse momenta that led to large @xmath6 is not valid any more .",
    "practical consequences of these effects are presented for the cases of the cross sections of dis and dvcs .",
    "we predict that the ratio of dvcs to dis amplitudes should decrease with energy and very slowly approach one from above at very large collision energies .",
    "in addition the ratio @xmath7 will also slowly decrease with energy .",
    "technically these effects follow from the more rapid increase with the energy of the pqcd interaction for smaller dipole and the @xmath0 factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "second , we study a closely related phenomenon of the increase with the energy of the characteristic transverse momenta of the gluon / quark configurations in the wave function of the projectile responsible for the transition to the black disk / froissart ( bdr ) regime .",
    "we discuss the impact of this phenomena on the slowing of the rate of increase of the coherence length as a function of energy .",
    "the most striking implication of our analysis is the change of the space structure of the wave packet describing a rapid hadron . in the classical multiperipheral picture of gribov",
    "a hadron has a shape of a pancake of the longitudinal size @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the scale of soft qcd ) which does not depend on the incident energy @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", we find the biconcave shape for the rapid hadron in pqcd with the minimal longitudinal length ( that corresponds to small impact parameter @xmath10 ) decreasing with increase of energy and being smaller for the nuclei than for the nucleons .",
    "the known rate of increase of the black disk regime momenta leads to the generalization of the old gribov formula for the total dis cross section in the black disk regime .",
    "we are able to establish an overall coefficient in the cross section dependence on the @xmath11 in the black disk regime .",
    "we determine the relative contributions of pqcd and black disk regime into the total small dipole dis cross section at high energies .",
    "this new expression for the total cross section of a dis scattering at very large energies is relevant to lhec and lhc .",
    "it is worth noting that the effect of the increase of the transverse momenta in the fragmentation region in pqcd found in this paper is very different from the seemingly similar effect found in the leading @xmath12 bfkl approximation@xcite : for the central rapidity kinematics @xmath13 .",
    "the latter is the property of the radiation within a ladder , i.e. of a diffusion in the space of the transverse momenta @xcite . indeed",
    ", it has been known for some time already that if we look at characteristic transverse momenta in a rung with a fixed number n in bfkl ladder , than in the multiregge kinematics the transverse momenta do not depend on energy .",
    "this fact follows from the derivation of lipatov diffusion equation , where @xmath14-the number of the rung under study .",
    "the lipatov diffusion arises since a number of rungs @xmath15 in the ladder increases with the rapidity y. an alternative proof that the transverse momenta do not rise in multiregge kinematics with a fixed number of rungs has been given in ref .",
    "on the other hand the property we are dealing here with is the value of the transverse momenta in the wave function of the projectile .",
    "the rapid increase with the energy of the characteristic transverse scales in the fragmentation region in the black disk regime has been found first in refs .",
    "the prediction of the increase with energy of the transverse momenta in the impact factor , in the kinematical domain where methods of the pqcd are still applicable can be considered as a precursor of the black disk regime indicating the possibility of the smooth matching between the pqcd and black disk regimes .",
    "the characteristic feature of the lo dipole solution is the approximate bjorken scaling for the structure functions of dis , i.e. the two dimensional conformal invariance for the moments of the structure functions . in this approximation as well as within the leading @xmath16 approximation ,",
    "the transverse momenta of quarks within the dipole produced by the local electroweak current are restricted by the virtuality of the external field : @xmath17 here @xmath18 mev is a qcd scale .",
    "it follows from the qcd factorization theorem proved in refs .",
    "@xcite that within this kinematical range the smaller transverse size @xmath19 of the configuration ( the transverse distance between the constituents of the dipole ) corresponds to a more rapid increase of its interaction with the collision energy : @xmath20 here @xmath21 or @xmath22 depends whether the dipole consists of color triplet or color octet constituents and is a su(3 ) casimir operator , @xmath23 is an integrated gluon distribution function and @xmath24 is a parameter @xmath25 .",
    "it is well known in the dglap approximation that the structure function @xmath26 increases more rapidly with @xmath27 at larger @xmath2 .",
    "this property agrees well with the recent hera data .",
    "our main result is that the median transverse momenta @xmath28 and invariant masses of the leading @xmath29 pair in the fragmentation region in the pqcd regime grow as @xmath30 m^2&\\sim & b(q^2)/(x_0/x)^{\\lambda_{\\rm m } ( q^2)}.\\nonumber\\\\[10pt ] \\label{main}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 and @xmath31 are the median squared transverse momentum and invariant mass of the quark - antiquark pair in the fragmentation region .",
    "( the median means that the configurations with the momentum / masses less than the median one contribute half of the total crosssection ) .",
    "the exponential factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 are both approximately @xmath34 .",
    "these factors are weakly dependent on the external virtuality @xmath2",
    ". their exact values also depend on the details of the process , i.e. whether we consider the dis process with longitudinal or transverse photons , as well as on the model and approximation used .",
    "this dependence , however , turns out to be very mild .",
    "the exact form of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is given below .",
    "the function @xmath37 for longitudinal photons due to relation m^2=,[con]and the dominance of the @xmath38 configurations . for transverse photons",
    "however @xmath39 for realistic energies due a dominant contributions of configurations with @xmath40 in the total crosssections , i.e. @xmath41 due to the relation [ con ] ( @xmath42 is the fraction of the total momentum of the dipole carried by one of its constituents ) .",
    "the characteristic invariant masses of transverse @xmath29 pair are of the order @xmath2 at realistic energies .",
    "we carry out the calculations in a wide region of a phase space : 10 ^ -7<x<10 ^ -2 , 3 gev^2<q^2<100 gev^2 .",
    "[ region ] we also obtain the increase of the median transverse momenta and invariant masses for the jet distributions for both longitudinal and transverse photons .",
    "although the increase of the transverse momenta in the fragmentation region was obtained in this paper in the lo approximation of pqcd it should be valid in the nlo as well .",
    "indeed , it is known that the nlo radiative corrections to the impact factor are small @xcite .",
    "there are indeed large radiative corrections to the ladder however these corrections are already included in the lo cteq functions , that were matched to phenomenological data for the experimentally studied region of @xmath43 .",
    "let us note that the transverse momenta for the case of the transverse photons were calculated in the framework of the perturbative qcd . in order to ensure separation from soft physics ( the ajm model )",
    ", we calculated the average parton momenta with the cutoff @xmath44 gev@xmath45 .",
    "the relative contribution of the aj quickly decreases with energy , although it is still considerable at hera energies and @xmath2 few gev@xmath45 .",
    "finally , we discuss the possible applications of our results to pp , pa collisions at the lhc .",
    "we explain that characteristic phenomena at central impact parameters are the blackening of the interactions , the increase with the energy of the parton momenta , and suppression of soft qcd contributions . at sufficiently large energies",
    "the collisions at central impact parameters will be dominated by a phase with unbroken chiral and conformal symmetries . on the contrary , the peripheral collisions will be dominated by a phase with the spontaneously broken symmetries .",
    "applicability of this picture to qcd physics at lhc will be subject of further research .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "first , in section 2 we derive the spectral representation for the total crosssection of the dis .",

    "are discussed in appendixes . in appendix",
    "a we remind the reader the basic ideas of the derivation of the dipole model , in particular we give a detailed derivation of the momentum representation of the total crosssection . in appendix",
    "b we remind the reader the basic formulae of the ajm model . in appendix c",

    "e we present some interpolation formulae that describe the data on median momenta as function of x and @xmath2 as described in tables 1,2 .",
    "in this section we shall use the dipole approximation to derive the momentum representation for the total cross - sections of the dis for both transverse and longitudinal photons . within the lo approximation the qcd factorization theorem allows to express the total cross section of the scattering of the longitudinally polarized photon with virtuality @xmath47 off a hadron target as the convolution of the square of the virtual photon wave function calculated in the dipole approximation and the cross section of the dipole scattering off a hadron @xcite . in the target rest frame the cross section for the scattering of longitudinally",

    "the dglap approximation ensures additional general property : the smaller size of the configuration in the wave function of the projectile photon leads to the smaller interaction with the target , but this interaction increases with the energy more rapidly .",
    "such spectral representation is not valid for transverse photons due to the ajm effects , since the configurations with smaller z dominate ( see below ) , and the integrand in the corresponding equation contains the contribution of different configurations ( contrary to the preqcd spectral expansions ) .",

    "<S> the dipole and the dglap approximations are combined with the @xmath0 factorization theorem to demonstrate the fundamental property of pqcd : smaller is the size of the colorless quark - gluon configurations in the fragmentation region , more rapid is the increase of its interaction with the target as a function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider two closely related properties of the wave function of the projectile ( i ) the transverse momenta of the quark(antiquark ) within the @xmath1 pair , produced in the fragmentation region by the strongly virtual photon , increase with the decrease of x for fixed @xmath2 , ( ii ) increase of the relative contribution of pqcd to the structure functions as compared to soft qcd contribution at central impact parameters due to a rapid increase with energy of the cross section of interaction of small dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> practical consequences of these effects are presented for the cases of the cross sections of dis and dvcs . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the ratio of dvcs to dis amplitudes should very slowly approach one from above at very large collision energies . </S>",
    "<S> second , we study a closely related phenomenon of the increase of the transverse momenta with the energy of the characteristic transverse momenta of the gluon / quark configurations responsible for the transition to the black disk regime . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the impact of this phenomenona on the slowing of the dependence on the initial energy of the coherence length . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a rapid projectile has the biconcave shape , which is different from the expectations of the preqcd parton model where a fast hadron has a pancake shape . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the increase of the transverse momenta leads to a new expression for the total cross section of a dis scattering at very large energies , relevant to lhec and lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the impact of the discovered phenomena on the hard processes in pp collisions , and on the dominance of different phases of chiral and conformal symmetries in the central and peripheral pp , pa , and aa collisions . </S>"
