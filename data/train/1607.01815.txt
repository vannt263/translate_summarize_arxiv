    "non - topological soliton models which are effective models inspired from the underlying qcd theory are phenomenologically successful in describing the low energy nuclear physics . however , the main calculation methods in these models are based on mean field approximation , in other words treating the fields classically  @xcite .",
    "the quantum corrections in the background fields of spatially non - trivial configurations are very difficult to calculate .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that these calculations are nonlocal . during the past decades",
    "different calculation methods and approximate schemes have been developed on this problem  @xcite . like the derivative expansion method , which is an expansion of nonlocal effective action into an infinite series of local actions in the order of the number of space - time derivatives ,",
    "was formulated and applied to evaluate the one loop quantum correction of soliton models  @xcite . in ref",
    "@xcite , the quantum effects of the non - topological solion were calculated at strong coupling in a large-@xmath0 limit of a theory with @xmath0 flavors of dirac fermions coupled to a single real scalar field , which calculation was based on a derivative expansion .",
    "however due to the large-@xmath0 approximation there are no quantum corrections above order @xmath1 .",
    "some nonlocal methods were also carried out to study the viability of the derivative expansion  @xcite .",
    "it was indicated that only for slowly varying or large size soliton did the derivative expansion yield the accurate results . in some studies",
    "the euclidean green s functions were used and the partial wave expansion was made for one loop calculation . instead of doing the energy level summation they sum all contributions to the effective action from a series of green s functions after renormalizing the divergent parts  @xcite .",
    "there are also other schemes to calculate the one loop quantum effects in soliton configurations .",
    "farhi et al have developed a systematic and efficient procedure for calculating the quantum corrections about static field configuration in renormalizable field theories , in which all the divergences are removed by the same renormalization procedure  @xcite .",
    "the ambiguities of scheme and scale dependence of the renormalization can be also resolved in their method .",
    "it was applied to the higgs model to discuss the stabilities of top quark bags against the one loop quantum correction  @xcite . in the sector of topological",
    "solitons rebhan and van nieuwenhuizen have pointed out the ambiguities in the calculations of quantum corrections to solitons  @xcite . in the framework of suppersymmetry theory they worked out a unique scheme to calculate the one loop quantum effects with no ambiguities which preserved the supersymmetry  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i only focus on the non - topological solitons and i want to apply the scheme developed by farhi et al to calculate the one loop quantum corrections in friedberg - lee(fl ) non - topological soliton model .",
    "fl model is a kind of bag model which was developed to describe confinement  @xcite . without the strict constraining of the color dielectric functions of the vacuum",
    "the bag is just some bound state with a approximate confinement .",
    "the low energy hadron properties can be well produced by these bound states however the calculation is basically in a semiclassical level .",
    "quantum corrections in this model were studied based on derivative expansion method or euclidean green s function method  @xcite .",
    "as far as i know , there are no application of the practical method developed by farhi et al in calculating the quantum corrections in fl model . in this method one",
    "makes the energy level summation by calculating the discrete and continuous energy spectrum and the continuum contribution is determined through evaluating scattering phase shift in a concise way .",
    "the renormalization of the field configuration energy could be done in a manner consistent with on - shell mass and coupling constant renormalization in the perturbative sector .",
    "comparing to the precedent calculation technics in the literatures this method is clearer and more efficient .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section ii the fl model is introduced and the classical result is presented . in section",
    "iii the one loop quantum correction of the energy of the soliton is calculated following the scheme developed by farhi . in section iv , the numerical results are presented .",
    "consider the lagrangian of the fl model , = |(i_^-g)+12(_)(^)-u ( ) , whereu()=12!a^2 + 13!b^3 + 14!c^4+b .",
    "@xmath2 represents the quark field , and @xmath3 denotes the phenomenological scalar field .",
    "@xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the constants which are generally fitted in producing the properties of hadrons properly .",
    "@xmath6 is the bag constant . in the semiclassical approximation",
    "the sigma field is treated as the classical field and only the occupied valence levels for the quarks are included .",
    "the classical configuration consists of a static background @xmath3 field and @xmath0 valence quarks .",
    "the fields can thus be written as ( r , t)=(r ) ,  ( r , t)=e^-it_i=1^n_i(r )",
    ". then the static classical euler - lagrange equations can be obtained from the above lagrangian as ( -i+g)_i=_i , -^2++g_i=1^n|_i_i=0.[mean ] we further consider the spherical symmetrical configurations of the fields which means , ( r)=(r ) ,  _",
    "i(r)=1r (    c f(r ) +",
    "i g(r )    ) y_m , where @xmath7 is the two - component pauli spinor harmonic and @xmath8 is spatial unit vector . the equations could be written into the spherical coordinate , ( + ) f(r)+(g(r)+)g(r)=0,[u ] ( -)g(r)+(g(r)-)f(r)=0,[v ] + - - n g(f^2(r ) - g^2(r ) ) = 0 , where the dirac quantum number @xmath9 . for the mean field approximation the @xmath0 valence quarks",
    "have been put into the lowest @xmath10-wave level which means the angular momentum quantum number @xmath11 or the dirac quantum number @xmath12 .",
    "the quark wave functions should satisfy the normalization condition 4(f^2(r)+g^2(r))r^2dr=1 .",
    "the potential @xmath13 has two minima corresponding to the two vacuums . for @xmath14",
    "there is a local minimum of the potential corresponding to the perturbative vacuum ; for @xmath15 there is a global minimum which is the physical vacuum .",
    "if only the sigma field is taken into account without considering the color dielectric function in this model , it will not generate absolute confinement . in the physical vacuum @xmath15 , the valence quark will acquire a large mass @xmath16 and be forced to rest at the bottom of the continuum spectrum . for @xmath0",
    "valence quarks the total energy of the system will simply be @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the background of a nontrivial @xmath3 field there might be some bound state levels with energy @xmath18 which can allocate the quarks lowering the energy of the whole system at the expense of creating such nontrivial configuration of @xmath3 field . generally speaking the spherical configuration of the @xmath3 field",
    "will take the following form , ( r)=_v - , [ bag]where the second term on the r.h.s of the equation is a woods - saxon potential well with depth @xmath19 . inside a sphere of radius @xmath20 the @xmath3 field almost vanish , while outside the well it takes its asymptotic vacuum value @xmath21 .",
    "the valence quarks are bounded in the well . intuitively speaking the @xmath0 valence",
    "quarks dig a hole in the vacuum and form a non - topological soliton bag which could be interpreted as a hadron .",
    "the energy or mass of this classical soliton is e_cl = n+4drr^2 .    by fitting the hadron properties",
    "the model parameters could be fixed but not uniquely .",
    "there are some flexibilities in choosing the parameters  @xcite .",
    "for baryons i take @xmath22 and choose one set of parameters as @xmath23 .",
    "the soliton equations could be numerically solved which yield a classical soliton energy @xmath24 .",
    "first i clarify the meaning of the quantum correction in our study . in principle",
    "the quantum corrections in fl model should include loop corrections from both quark fields and the @xmath3 field , however since the @xmath3 field is only a phenomenological field describing the long - range collective effects of qcd , the loop corrections coming from the sigma field will be ignored .",
    "so i just consider one loop fluctuations from the quark field in a static nontrivial configuration of @xmath3 field background , which means the quantum corrections are due to the effect of the sea quarks scattering the classical soliton bag .",
    "this is the exactly case which could be handled by the calculation scheme developed by farhi .",
    "we will follow their scheme to calculate the quantum correction in the following .",
    "the one loop effective action after integrating out the quark field is given by s_eff = s_cl+s_ct - id where @xmath25 is the classical part , @xmath26 is the counterterm part and @xmath27 is the dirac operator which general form is @xmath28 .",
    "the total energy could be derived by @xmath29 and the result is e_tot = e_cl+e_ct+e_vac^ , where @xmath30 is the necessary renormalization counterterm and @xmath31 is a result of the energy level summation from both discrete and continuum spectrum .",
    "the whole energy spectrum is determined by the following stationary dirac equation = e. here i could separate the potential @xmath32 into two parts : one is the quark mass in the physical vacuum and the other is the woods - saxon potential according to ( [ bag ] ) , which means g(r)=m+v(r ) ,  m = g_v ,  v(r)=- .",
    "it becomes a problem of massive quark scattering in a potential @xmath33 .",
    "for the fixed potential @xmath33 one could solve the dirac equation and get the continuous energy spectrum @xmath34 and some possible discrete energy spectrum @xmath18 , thus the energy level sum over discrete and continuous spectrum is e_vac^=-_ne_n-_l(2l+1)dk_l(k)e(k ) , [ evac ] where @xmath35 is the density of states in momentum space with the angular momentum quantum number @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the degenerate factor of the angular momentum projection .",
    "if one normalizes the wave function in a large spherical box which means imposing the wave function vanish at the boundary and then makes the box volume to infinity , one could find the density of states @xmath35 will relate to the scattering phase shift @xmath38 in the following way _ l(k)=_l^(k)+1 , where @xmath39 is the density state when the potential @xmath33 is absent . in our case this part will be subtracted from the density of states since i only consider the quantum corrections coming from the quarks scattering to the soliton bag .",
    "the main difficulties come from the calculation of the scattering phase shift @xmath38 and the renormalization . to eliminate the divergence of the integral over continuum spectrum in equation ( [ evac ] ) the phase shift needs to be rendered by a born approximation according to the stand method in quantum mechanics . in one loop calculation only the first and second born approximation should be subtracted from the phase shift . therefore the subtracted phase shift is defined as    @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the first and second born approximations to @xmath38 . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is shown that these subtractions are added back into the energy by using their explicit diagrammatic representation in terms of divergent diagrams as one and two insertions of @xmath3 field to the fermion loop , which will be renormalized by the counterterms @xmath30 and yield a finite contribution denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "thus one has the renormalized one loop quantum correction energy e^ren_vac=-_ne_n-_l(2l+1)dk1e(k)+_2 .",
    "the detail calculations of the subtracted phase shift @xmath43 and renormalized energy part @xmath42 are presented in appendix a and appendix b respectively .",
    "this efficient renormalization scheme was first introduced by schwinger in studying the energy of the electron s quantum fluctuations in qed and then developed by farhi to make it a practical tool for the study of the quantum fluctuations in nontrivial field configurations  @xcite .",
    "the numerical result of the phase shift @xmath38 is presented in figure ( [ x1 ] ) .",
    "it could be seen that the amplitude of the phase shift decreases with @xmath36 increasing .",
    "however at @xmath46 the phase shift decreases with momentum increasing in a logarithmic way and approaches zero very slowly .",
    "the integration over momentum is obviously divergent . by subtracting the born approximation @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath48 one obtain the subtracted phase shift @xmath43 .",
    "due to the intrinsic feature of the arctangent function in the phase shift the numerical result of @xmath43 will have several cusps with the varying momentum .",
    "however if one take the derivative of @xmath43 with respect to the momentum the cusp will disappear . in figure ( [ x2 ] ) the numerical result of @xmath49",
    "is presented .",
    "one can see all the curves are smooth . when @xmath46 they all approach zero exponentially which makes the integral over momentum finite",
    ". meanwhile their amplitudes decrease with @xmath36 increasing . here",
    "the energy term associated with different angular momentum @xmath36 can be defined as e^(l)=dk1e(k ) .",
    "the numerical results of them are in the following e^(0)=-4.26fm^-1 ,  e^(1)=-0.53fm^-1 ,  e^(2)=-0.3fm^-1 ,  e^(3)=-0.19fm^-1 ,  ... additionally there is one bound state which energy is @xmath50 .",
    "however the energy level of this bound state has already been occupied by the three valence quarks .",
    "the sea quark from the vacuum could not sit there thus the energy level summation will not include the energy level from this bound state .",
    "so the vacuum correction only comes from summing the continuum energy spectrum of the scattering states .",
    "considering the summation of the energy over @xmath36 from @xmath11 to @xmath51 together with @xmath42 which is evaluated in appendix b and the result is @xmath52 the renormalized quantum correction energy will be @xmath53 which magnitude has already exceed the value of the classical energy which is @xmath54 , not to mention the energy terms with @xmath55 .",
    "thus the one loop quantum correction is quite large and will not support the existence of the soliton in fl model in this context .",
    "in this appendix i will show how to calculate the subtracted phase shift @xmath43 .",
    "first i rewrite the coupled first order differential equations into the decoupled second order differential equations as f-f-f=0 , [ f ] g+g-g=0 , [ g ] where the prime denotes the differentiation with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "either of them can be used to calculate the energy spectrum and will give the identical result . in the following",
    "i will choose equation ( [ f ] ) for the calculation of the phase shift .",
    "when @xmath57 the asymptotic form of equation ( [ f ] ) is f-f=0 , where @xmath58 .",
    "the solutions will be spherical hankel functions . at the same time for equation ( [ f ] )",
    "the solution should satisfy that @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "thus one could introduce two linearly independent solutions to equation ( [ f ] ) as f^(1)_l(r)=e^i_l(k , r)rh^(1)_l(kr ) , f^(2)_l(r)=e^-i^*_l(k , r)rh^(2)_l(kr ) , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the hankel functions of the first and second kinds and @xmath63 .",
    "the function @xmath64 should satisfy @xmath65 as @xmath66 .",
    "then the scattering solution is f_l(r)=f^(2)_l(r)+e^i_l(k)f^(1)_l(r ) , and obeys @xmath67 , which leads to the result of the scattering phase shift _",
    "l(k)=-2_l(k,0 ) , where @xmath68 means the real part . by substituting @xmath69 into equation ( [ f ] ) one",
    "could obtain the equation of @xmath70 i_lrh_l+2i_l(h_l+rh_l)-^2_lrh_l-(i_lrh_l+h_l+rh_l)-rh_l=0 .",
    "[ ricatti ] in the fixed background soliton field of @xmath71 this equation could be numerically solved to obtain the phase shift @xmath38 .",
    "to get the born approximation to the phase shift one should expand @xmath70 in powers of @xmath5 as _ l = g_l1+g^2_l2 + .",
    "[ beta ] substituting the expansion ( [ beta ] ) into equation ( [ ricatti ] ) and neglecting the higher order terms @xmath72 one can obtain a set of coupled differential equations about @xmath73 and @xmath74 as i_l1rh_l+(2i_l1-)(h_l+rh_l)-h_l=0 , i_l2rh_l-^2_l1rh_l-_l1rh_l+ ( 2i_l2+)(h_l+rh_l)+rh_l=0 , these equations could be numerically solved to obtain the first and second born approximations of the phase shift namely @xmath47 and @xmath48 as ^(1)_l=-2g_l1(k , r=0 ) ,  ^(2)_l=-2g^2_l2(k , r=0 ) .",
    "finally the subtracted phase shift @xmath75 can be determined by equation ( [ delta ] ) .      in this appendix",
    "i will show how to calculate the renormalized energy part @xmath42 .",
    "in diagrammatic representation the related graphs to the first and second born approximations are shown in figure ( [ x3 ] ) .",
    "the first graph is the tadpole loop which is divergent and can be totally removed by the counter term .",
    "the second graph can be evaluated in the following form i(q^2)&=&-g^2 + & = & -4g^2 , where @xmath76 .",
    "combining the two denominators using the feynman parameter one has 1(p+q)^2+m^21p^2+m^2=_0 ^ 1dx , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 . changing the integration variable @xmath79 one gets i(q^2)=-4g^2_0",
    "^ 1dx , where @xmath80 .",
    "the divergent integral could be regulated by dimensional regulation and using the following formulas = d^-(b - a - d/2 , + ( -n+x)= , where @xmath81 . the regulated result is ( q^2)=\\{1(q^2 + 2m^2)+16q^2+m^2-_0 ^ 1dxd^2}. the divergent part can be renormalized by a on - shell mass renormalization which means ._ren(q^2)|_q^2=-m^2_=0 ,  .|_q^2=-m^2_=0 , where @xmath82 is taken as the usual sigma meson mass @xmath83 .",
    "the divergent parts are removed by the counter terms .",
    "then the renormalized result is _",
    "ren(q^2)=-\\{_0 ^ 1dx + ( q^2+m^2_)_0 ^ 1dxx(1-x)}. [ pi ] in the following calculation i will change the four momentum to the three momentum as @xmath84 by setting @xmath85 . now the finite energy term @xmath42 can be evaluated as _ 2=_0^_ren(q^2)(q)^2 , [ gama ] where @xmath86 is the fourier transform of @xmath87 which is ( q)&=&d^3(()-_v)e^-i + & = & _ 0^ r(qr)((r)-_v)dr .",
    "notice that the homogeneous background field @xmath21 is subtracted from @xmath71 because it will generate the energy from the scattering effect to the homogeneous vacuum background which is infinite and not relevant to our physical result .",
    "this integration can analytically be evaluated through the contour integral in the complex plane and the result is ( q)=. substituting the above result of @xmath86 into equation ( [ gama ] ) together with the result of @xmath88 from equation ( [ pi ] ) , the renormalized energy part @xmath42 can be numerically calculated .",
