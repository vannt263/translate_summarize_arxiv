    "observations over the last two decades have unveiled the existence of compact stellar nuclei at the centers of most intermediate and low luminosity galaxies  @xcite . with masses of order",
    "@xmath3 the stellar mass of the host galaxy and typical radii of only a few parsecs , these clusters , often referred to as nscs , are the densest stellar systems observed in the universe  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the masses of nscs ( @xmath4 ) obey fairly tight correlations with properties of the host galaxies such as the bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 ) and mass ( @xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have shown that these correlations are much shallower than the corresponding ones for mbhs .",
    "@xcite finds that nsc  masses obey @xmath6 , while the masses of mbhs , @xmath7 , follow a much steeper scaling relation @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing that for galaxies containing both a nsc  and a mbh , the ratio @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 the total mass in central massive objects ) shows less scatter than either @xmath11 or @xmath2  .",
    "the facts that both nscs and mbhs are found to follow tight correlations with their host galaxy properties , that they are found to coexist in some galaxies , and that in these galaxies they have comparable masses , point toward a picture where nscs and mbhs are both generic by - products of galaxy formation , and the growth mechanisms of nscs and mbhs are related to one another and to the host galaxy evolution .",
    "we have developed a semi - analytical model following the formation and evolution of galaxies , mbhs and nscs along cosmic history .",
    "previous calculations assumed nsc  formation to take place in isolated galaxies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus neglecting the possible role of galaxy mergers , as well as in - situ star formation processes . also , these early idealized attempts did not explore the possible interplay between mbh  and nsc  evolution .",
    "our model sheds light on exactly these points , i.e. it allows us to assess for the first time the role of galaxy mergers , mbh  mergers and nuclear star formation on the formation and evolution of nscs .",
    "the backbone of this study is the semi - analytical galaxy formation model of  @xcite ( with the improvements described in @xcite ) .",
    "this model tracks the evolution of baryonic structures ( both in central galaxies and in satellites ) along dark matter merger trees produced with an extended press - schechter formalism , modified to reproduce the results of @xmath12-body simulations of dark matter halos  @xcite .",
    "the baryonic structures ultimately originate from the hot , largely unprocessed intergalactic medium , which cools to form cold gaseous galactic disks .",
    "these undergo quiescent star formation , which chemically enriches the interstellar medium and gives rise to stellar disks .",
    "both stellar and gaseous disks are disrupted by bar instabilities  giving rise to pseudo - bulges that undergo a quiescent disk - like star - formation process  and by major mergers  which form classical bulges with violent star - formation bursts , possibly triggered by turbulent gas flows .",
    "besides further enriching the interstellar medium , bar instabilities and ( mainly ) star - bursts are assumed to funnel cold , chemically enriched gas into a low - angular momentum nuclear reservoir , available for accretion onto the central mbh  @xcite .",
    "possible mechanisms capable of removing angular momentum from the gas are shocks ( caused e.g. by mergers ) or radiation drag from star - bursts  @xcite , and we thus assume a linear correlation between the feeding of the nuclear reservoir and the star - formation rate in the bulge ( or pseudo - bulge )",
    ". the mbhs may form from either high - redshift seeds arising from pop iii stars  ( i.e. @xmath13  light  seeds ; * ? ? ? * ) or from the remnants of protogalactic disks  ( i.e. @xmath14  heavy  seeds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the former case , we allow moderately super - eddington accretion onto the massive mbhs so as to better reproduce the quasar luminosity function at high redshift  @xcite .    here , we improve on this model by supplementing it with semi - analytical prescriptions for the formation and evolution of nscs .",
    "these can grow either by local star formation in the nuclear regions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by infall of stellar clusters  @xcite toward the center of the galaxy , as a result of dynamical friction .    in more detail ,",
    "we assume that the nuclear reservoir from which the mbh  accretes _ also _ undergoes quiescent disk - like star formation  for which we adopt the same star - formation prescription as in galactic disks and pseudobulges , i.e. that of @xcite  and we then assume that the stars formed in this nuclear reservoir contribute to the nsc . note that even though we model star formation in this nuclear gas reservoir as quiescent , our models also assume that the reservoir s feeding is correlated with star formation in the bulge , and thus mainly with turbulence - driven starbursts following major mergers .    as for the infall of stellar clusters , we assume that the latter form with an efficiency @xmath15 during star - formation episodes in both disks and bulges / pseudo - bulges , and with initial mass function @xmath16  @xcite , between @xmath17 and @xmath18 . initially , these stellar clusters follow the same spatial distribution as the stars , but after their formation we follow their ( average )",
    "infall towards the nsc   under dynamical friction from both the stars and gas . in doing so",
    ", we also account for both tidal heating and evaporation of the stellar clusters due to the galaxy s tidal field , and for the tidal disruption by the mbh  when they approach the center .",
    "when the mbh  mass becomes @xmath19 , the stellar clusters are completely disrupted before reaching the center , and the contribution of stellar cluster infall to nsc  growth becomes negligible  @xcite .",
    "whenever two galaxies merge , their mbhs are assumed to form a binary . due to the interactions with the stars in the nuclear region , a mbh  binary ejects from the system a mass ( in stars ) comparable to its own mass  @xcite . also , when a mbh  binary finally merges , the anisotropic emission of gravitational waves imparts a kick ( of up to several thousands of km / s , cf .",
    "@xcite ) to the mbh  remnant , and this also removes stars from the nuclear region .",
    "we thus model the total mass deficit @xmath20 caused by the inspiral and merger of mbh  binaries onto the nsc  mass by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the binary s mass ratio , @xmath23 its mass , @xmath24 the semi - major axis when the binary first becomes `` hard '' ( i.e. tightly bound ) , @xmath25 the separation at which gravitational - wave emission starts driving the binary s evolution ( cf .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xcite ) , @xmath26 the post - merger kick velocity ( computed using the fit to numerical - relativity simulations presented in @xcite ) , and @xmath27 the escape velocity from the central parts of the galaxy ( computed using the bulge and nsc  density profiles ) .",
    "the first term in equation  ( [ ejmass ] ) accounts for the mass deficit before the mbh  binary becomes hard  @xcite ; the second is the mass ejected from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ; and the third represents the mass deficit generated as the kicked mbh  heats up the surrounding core  @xcite .",
    "we also account for the tidal disruption of nscs by mbhs during galaxy mergers .",
    "more precisely , in a merger between a galaxy containing a mbh  and one containing only a nsc , the nsc  is tidally disrupted before reaching the center of the newly formed galaxy , if the mbh  mass is @xmath19 .",
    "this is the same process described above for the infall of stellar clusters .",
    "next , we present our model s predictions , with the free parameter @xmath15 set to its milky way value , i.e. @xmath28  @xcite . we have checked the robustness of our results against the mbh seed model ( i.e. light vs heavy seeds , with several halo occupation numbers ) , a different value for @xmath29 , a variable @xmath15  ( set to 0.07 , 0.04 and 0.5 in disk , quiescent and starburst galaxies respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other details of our model ( i.e. merger - tree resolution , initial redshift of the simulations , agn feedback prescriptions , etc . ) . indeed",
    ", we will show that the crucial ingredient to reproduce the observed global to nsc  correlations is the scouring effect due to mbhbinaries described by equation  ( [ ejmass ] ) .",
    "more details of our model will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .    .",
    "[ z - ev1],width=240 ]",
    "we describe the results from two realizations of our galaxy - formation model , namely our fiducial model , which accounts for the `` nsc  erosion '' due to mbh binaries through equation  ( [ ejmass ] ) ; and a `` nsc  preservation '' model where that effect is absent ( i.e. we set @xmath30 throughout the entire cosmic history ) .    our model s results",
    "are compared to a literature compilation of nsc  masses .",
    "we constructed our sample of nsc  objects by combining data from table 1 of @xcite , table 2 of @xcite , table 2 of @xcite and by estimating nsc   masses for the early type galaxies in the fornax cluster catalog of @xcite .",
    "the masses of the nscs in @xcite sample were calculated from the ( @xmath31 ) colors given in that paper and from the relations of @xcite .",
    "the galaxy velocity dispersion and bulge mass were also obtained from these papers or , when not available , from the hyperleda database  .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ scaling - r ] compare the observed @xmath32 and @xmath33 relations to our `` nsc  erosion '' model .",
    "we note the excellent agreement of our predictions with observations .",
    "in particular , the predicted scaling relations appear to broaden at higher velocity dispersion , as do the data .",
    "the broadening of the data appears to be caused by the subsample of galaxies with determined mbh  mass ( red points in figure  [ scaling - r ] ) .",
    "the nuclear to global correlations in these galaxies appear to flatten or even decline for spheroids with higher velocity dispersion , suggesting that the mbhs have played an important role in affecting the properties of their host nscs in these galaxies .",
    "the blue lines in the middle panels of figure  [ scaling - r ] shows the scaling relations obtained from the `` nsc  preservation '' model .",
    "note that the broadening at high @xmath5 s present in the upper panels disappears .",
    "this demonstrates that the broadening of the scaling relations seen in the `` nsc  erosion '' model is a consequence of dynamical ejection of stars from coalescing mbh  binaries .",
    "together with the model s predictions , we plot @xmath34 vs @xmath5 and @xmath1 , for nucleated galaxies with measured mbh  mass or an upper limit to it .",
    "mbh  masses and upper limits were taken from table 1 of @xcite , table 2 of @xcite , and table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the red lines show fits to these data .",
    "as can be seen , when the disruptive effect of mbh  binaries is not included , our model recovers the fitted functional form of the relation between @xmath35 and galaxy properties , both in slope and normalization .",
    "the fact that our `` nsc  preservation '' model predicts scaling correlations that are consistent with relations involving @xmath35 is not coincidental , but rather quite revealing .",
    "indeed , the mass ejected by a mbh  binary is of the order of the mass of the binary itself , with only a weak dependence on the binary s mass ratio and the initial density distribution of stars  @xcite .",
    "hence , the mass ejected in @xmath12 mbh  mergers is approximately @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the final mbh  mass .",
    "because infall of gas to the nuclear region can rapidly rebuild a nsc , the relevant quantity to estimate is the number of mbh  mergers since the era at which most of the gas was depleted from the galaxy . @xcite",
    "compute this quantity using semi - analytic models for galaxy mergers similar to ours .",
    "they find that the number of comparable - mass mbh mergers is weakly dependent on galaxy luminosity , and has a small dispersion around a median of @xmath38 , with values @xmath39 even for the most luminous galaxies .",
    "accordingly , derived mass deficits in `` core galaxies '' are also found to be peaked around a value of @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the total amount of ejected stellar mass is therefore determined mainly by , and is roughly equal to , @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 can be regarded as an approximate estimate ( with uncertainties of order a few ) of the nsc  mass that was in place before mass erosion due to mbh  binaries became important .",
    "our models do indeed confirm this .",
    "these facts explain why the `` nsc  preservation '' model predicts scaling correlations that are consistent with relations involving @xmath35 , and provide further support for the idea that the broadening / bending of the observed correlations between nsc   and host - galaxy properties is a consequence of the nuclear mass erosion caused by mbh binaries .",
    "finally , the lower panels of figure  [ scaling - r ] show the relations between @xmath35 and galaxy properties in the nsc  erosion model , for nucleated galaxies with a mbh .",
    "clearly , the choice of plotting the total @xmath35 mass significantly reduces the broadening that characterized the @xmath4 relations ( upper panels ) , but the scatter is slightly larger than in the `` nsc  preservation '' model ( middle panels ) .",
    "this is expected since @xmath20 only equals the final mbh  mass to first approximation ( see equation  [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the ancestry of a nsc   includes complicated processes leading to its growth , disruption , and regeneration if new material is accreted after a disruptive merger . in figure",
    "[ z - ev1 ] we illustrate the typical evolution of nscs as predicted by our fiducial `` nsc  erosion '' model . since the effect of mbh  binaries and mergers on nsc s is most important for large galaxies ( where they cause the broadening / bending of the correlations between nsc  and host - galaxy properties ) , we choose a galaxy with spheroid mass @xmath41 , at which the nsc  erosion becomes significant . in this example",
    ", the mbh  grows by short - lived accretion events triggered by bar instabilities of the host s galactic disk ( at @xmath42 ) or by major galactic mergers ( at @xmath43 ; note the corresponding growth of the reservoir following the merger - driven infall of cold gas to the nuclear regions ) .",
    "the nsc  grows more gradually through a combination of in - situ star formation ( especially at @xmath43 , when the growth of the reservoir triggers nuclear star formation ) , and infall of stellar clusters .",
    "the latter channel dominates over the former at high redshift , and is also enhanced at @xmath43 , since major galaxy mergers also cause violent bursts of star formation , which in turn enhance stellar - cluster formation . finally , at @xmath44",
    "the nsc  gets eroded by a series of minor mbh  mergers , but re - forms thanks to a steady infall of stellar clusters , which form as a result of quiescent star - formation activity as the galactic disk re - grows .",
    "figure  [ z - ev2 ] shows the redshift evolution of the @xmath45 relations for both mbhs and nscs , in the `` nsc erosion '' model ( left panels ) , and in the `` nsc preservation '' model ( right panels ) . in both models ,",
    "the mbh  growth appears inefficient at high redshifts relative to nsc  growth . at redshift @xmath46 , after the epoch of bright quasars , mbhs become the dominant nuclear component in the most massive galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is only at relatively late cosmic epochs that mbh  mergers become efficient at scouring their host clusters , in the `` nsc  erosion '' model .",
    "as can be seen , the `` nsc preservation '' model clearly over - predicts the mass of nscs in the brightest nucleated spheroids , while the `` nsc  erosion '' model at @xmath47 is in good agreement with the local @xmath45 relation for both mbhs and nscs .",
    "a comparison of our results to observational data reveals that the nsc  scaling correlations in the local universe carry an imprint of the merger and growth history of their companion mbhs .",
    "nscs are significantly eroded by mbh  binaries , causing a broadening of the observed nsc  empirical correlations in high - mass galaxies and at low redshifts .",
    "the nsc  scaling correlations can potentially be used to probe different nsc  evolutionary models , and also to place constraints on the merger and growth history of their host galaxies .",
    "however , the slope of the observed correlations involving nsc  masses is lowered by the inclusion , at the high-@xmath5 end , of nscs that were partly eroded by mbhs .",
    "hence , such relations can not be used to put reliable constraints on different nsc  formation models without also taking into account the scouring effect of mbh  binaries .",
    "we argue that the stellar mass removed from the center during mergers is of order of @xmath48 , and indeed we find that by replacing @xmath4 with @xmath49 , the observed scaling correlations agree remarkably well with those predicted by models that do not account for the scouring effect of mbh  binaries .",
    "our findings provide a natural explanation to why relations between @xmath35 and galaxy properties for nucleated galaxies show significantly less scatter than relations involving @xmath4 alone .",
    "the relations between @xmath35 and galaxy properties are much shallower ( @xmath50 ) than the same correlations for mbhs  ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "our results also explain the well known transition from mbh to nsc dominated galaxies as one proceeds from dwarfs to giant ellipticals , without the need of invoking competitive feedback processes from young nsc s  and/or agn activity .",
    "therefore , the formation of mbhs and nscs appear _ not _ to be mutually exclusive , with nscs being modified after their formation by the merger evolution of their companion mbhs .",
