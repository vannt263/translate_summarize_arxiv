    "<S> indeed , a split of the doubly degenerate dirac point into a pair of weyl nodes can be induced in the presence of broken time reversal or space inversion symmetry @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> broken space inversion symmetry at a single dirac cone leads to two weyl nodes hallmarked by the same momentum but shifted by the same amount in opposite directions along the energy axis relatively to each other , while broken time - reversal symmetry results in weyl nodes at the same energy but separated in momentum space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> evidences for weyl fermions with broken space inversion symmetry have been reported in so - called non - centrosymmetric , transition metal monopnictide crystals , like taas and tap @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> most recently , eumnbi@xmath0 and ybmnbi@xmath0 , isostructural to the sr and ca composition respectively , were thoroughly scrutinized with respect to the electronic properties of weyl fermions @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> a variety of representative dirac and weyl semimetals , like for instance pyrochlore iridates , quasicrystals and transition metal monopnictides , were recently addressed from the perspective of their optical response @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we are triggered by the opportunity to exploit ybmnbi@xmath0 and eumnbi@xmath0 as an arena in order to explore the optical response and chase the related fingerprints of a type ii weyl semimetal ( i.e. , in the yb - based material ) in contrast to its semimetal counterpart ( i.e. , the eu compound ) . </S>",
    "<S> our optical experiment provides evidence for two intervals with a linear frequency dependence of the real part ( @xmath2 ) of the optical conductivity in the yb material , with the slope of the low - energy larger than the one of the high - energy interval . </S>",
    "<S> both linear frequency dependences of @xmath2 extrapolates to zero conductivity at the origin of the frequency axis . in the eu compound </S>",
    "<S> only one linear frequency dependence can be clearly identified at high frequencies , cutting the frequency axis at a finite value though , indicating its gapped nature . </S>",
    "<S> our results broadly agree with recent predictions of the optical response in weyl semimetals @xcite but equally put novel constraints for future theoretical activities .    </S>",
    "<S> our eumnbi@xmath0 and ybmnbi@xmath0 single and well characterized crystals were grown after the procedure described in ref . and , leading to specimens with shiny surface of typical size 2x2 mm@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we collect reflectivity spectra ( @xmath4 ) from the far - infrared up to the ultraviolet as a function of temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the prerequisite in order to perform reliable kramers - kronig transformation , giving access to all optical functions . </S>",
    "<S> we thus achieve the optical conductivity on which we focus here our attention . to this end , standard and </S>",
    "<S> well established extrapolation procedures are applied at low as well as high frequencies . in the dc limit </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) we use the hagen - rubens ( hr ) extrapolation of @xmath4 ( @xmath6 ) with dc conductivity in agreement with the transport values @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) the measured @xmath4 spectra at 10 and 300 k for both compounds . while @xmath4 in the yb material increases in a rather metallic - like fashion upon decreasing the frequency , with a plasma edge feature below 5000 @xmath7 , @xmath4 of the eu compound is very much overdamped , merging only at the lower frequency limit of our spectrometer into the metallic hr extrapolation . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , there is a quite remarkable temperature dependence , which we will further elaborate below . before going any further in the data presentation </S>",
    "<S> , it is worth pointing out that in the broken space inversion symmetry compound taas , @xmath4 gets depleted in the far infrared at low temperatures @xcite , in a quite opposite manner than for our findings . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a sharp plasma edge in @xmath4 of taas only develops below about 100 @xmath7 at 5 k.    the corresponding @xmath2 is shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ reflectivity_sigma1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 in the eu material is significantly lower than in the yb compound . by first inspecting the spectra at low frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> we recognize a metallic contribution merging into a drude - like resonance well below 100 @xmath7 at all temperatures , in broad agreement with the dc transport properties of both materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this bears testimony to a rather small scattering rate ( i.e. , width of the drude resonance ) , so that the metallic component is quite narrow , falling into the spectral range dominated by the hr extrapolation of the measured @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a narrowing of the drude resonance has been also encountered in taas with decreasing temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the overall metallic contribution is however rather weak , particularly in the eu compound , which suggests small drude weight and is quite typical for a semimetallic behavior with moderate - to - low concentration of itinerant charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the rather fuzzy signature of the fermi surface , as measured with arpes technique @xcite . because of the narrow nature of the drude resonance in @xmath2 , it is not realistic to artificially disentangle the related temperature dependence of the drude parameters , plasma frequency and scattering rate .    three broad peaks at @xmath8 100 , 500 and 6000 @xmath7 and at @xmath8 300 , 2500 and 10000 @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> dominate @xmath2 in yb and eu compound , respectively ( see plain arrows in fig . [ reflectivity_sigma1](c ) and ( d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the absorptions at 100 and 300 @xmath7 in the yb and eu material , respectively , are rather broad and not compatible with phonon modes , which would generally sharpen with decreasing temperature , we ascribe all three absorptions , shaping the optical conductivity of both compounds , to characteristic electronic transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we further note the presence of shoulders at the low - frequency side of the peak centered at 300 @xmath7 in the eu material , as well as at @xmath8 1500 @xmath7 in the yb compound ( see dashed arrows in fig . </S>",

    "<S> figures [ sigma_1_norm](a ) and ( b ) emphasize @xmath2 at selected temperatures in the spectral range of relevance for the following discussion . </S>",
    "<S> the important temperature dependence of @xmath2 implies a reshuffling of spectral weight . </S>",
    "<S> the insets of panels ( a ) and ( b ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma_1_norm ] deploy the integrated spectral weight ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 being a cut - off frequency ) at 10 and 300 k in both compounds . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that the spectral weight is fully conserved when integrating @xmath2 at any temperatures up to @xmath11 2 ev , thus satisfying the optical sum rules beyond this energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is a piling up of spectral weight at infrared frequencies upon decreasing temperature , which is more substantial in the yb than in the eu material and can not be solely ascribed to the drude narrowing . </S>",
    "<S> the full recovery of @xmath12 at energies of about 2 ev might suggest that its accumulation at low frequencies upon lowering the temperature mainly results from its progressive shift from the near and mid infrared spectral ranges .    in order to emphasize the comparison among the excitation spectra of both compounds , we normalize @xmath2 at 10 k by the value @xmath13 at the peak frequency @xmath14 = 500 and 2500 @xmath7 for the yb and eu material , respectively , as shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> sigma_1_norm](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate at this stage that the low - frequency side of the peaks at 100 and 500 @xmath7 in the yb compound can be fairly well approximated with a linear frequency dependence of @xmath2 , a major fingerprint of this weyl semimetal ( dashed lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma_1_norm](c ) as well as thin dotted lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma_1_norm](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is true at all temperatures , although the energy interval of the linearity in @xmath2 gets larger at low temperatures . in the eu compound , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , a linear frequency dependence of @xmath2 is only guessed at the low - frequency side of the strongest peak at 2500 @xmath7 and most clearly at low temperatures ( dashed line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma_1_norm](c ) as well as thin dotted line in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the shoulder on the low - frequency side of the peak at 300 @xmath7 in the eu compound ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ reflectivity_sigma1](d ) ) , prior the sharp onset of the metallic drude resonance , impedes to single out a robust linearity of @xmath2 at such low frequencies , even over a tiny interval .    </S>",
    "<S> band structure calculations can set the stage for the genesis of weyl nodes . when spin - orbital coupling is neglected , the expected linear dispersions , generated almost exclusively by bi@xmath0 @xmath15 states , cross near or at the fermi level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such dirac - like crossings are essential ingredients towards the realization of weyl nodes and their presence is more favorable in the staggered structure of the yb atoms than in the coincident one of the eu atoms relative to the bi layers . from fully relativistic band structure calculations , taking into account the mn @xmath16 electrons magnetism ( i.e. , antiferromagnetic ordering ) and spin - orbital coupling </S>",
    "<S> , it can be evinced that two bands due to mn states and bi @xmath15 states contribute to the formation of the fermi surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbital and exchange interactions lead to massive dirac states in both materials , so that gaps open in most parts of the brillouin zone ( bz ) and are larger in the eu than in the yb compound . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the magnetism associated with the eu element more strongly shifts apart the electronic bands . </S>",
    "<S> this is overall consistent with the observation that the optical excitations in @xmath2 occur at lower energies in ybmnbi@xmath0 than in eumnbi@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> while eumnbi@xmath0 is a semimetal with incipient gapped dirac cones , it can be shown that the degeneracy at the dirac points in ybmnbi@xmath0 can be lifted by additionally breaking the time reversal symmetry with a canted antiferromagnetic order @xcite of the mn atoms , thus inducing the formation of weyl nodes . by symmetry and as confirmed by arpes investigation , there are four pairs of weyl nodes ( so 8 points in total ) @xcite .    given the generic features of the electronic band structure , we now turn our attention to the predicted optical conductivity @xcite in the case of two non - degenerate dirac cones shifted in reciprocal space by a finite reciprocal q - vector . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , the fermi level is pinned to the location of the nodes . beyond the intraband ( drude ) contribution ( which might depend very much from disorder and exact location of the fermi level with respect to the weyl nodes ) the characteristic interband feature in @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> should be a kink , generated by the largest absorption between the two paired cones ( orange plain arrow in the left inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma_1_norm](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this van hove singularity breaks the expected linear frequency dependence of @xmath2 for a single dirac cone in two quasi - linear parts with variable slopes ( associated with transitions connecting states with linear dispersion at the dirac cones , see blue and green dashed arrows in the left inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma_1_norm](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the exact behavior of the interband contribution to @xmath2 results from the balance between two parameters : a so - called mass term ( @xmath17 ) related to the spin - orbital coupling and a magnetic zeeman - like term ( @xmath18 ) necessary to break time reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance frequency of the van hove singularity depends from the relative ratio @xmath19 @xcite , so that for increasing @xmath19 from 0 to 1 ( where the phase boundary to a gapped semimetal is encountered ) the location of the kink in @xmath2 moves toward low frequencies . for @xmath20 1 , </S>",
    "<S> the two quasi - linear regions in @xmath2 are characterized by different slopes , so that the slope of the low - frequency response below the kink increases , while the photon - energy range over which it applies decreases . above the kink </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath2 rises with a reduced slope with respect to the situation of the massless dirac cone and the extrapolation of the linear @xmath2 to zero frequency cuts the conductivity axis at a finite positive value @xcite . for @xmath20 0 , @xmath2 is supposed to increase linearly with the same slope as for a single dirac cone on both sides of the kink and the overall linear frequency dependence of @xmath2 extrapolates to zero conductance at the origin of the frequency axis . </S>",
    "<S> a second van hove singularity may also occur because of transitions between states due to the lifted degeneracy of the original dirac cones ( pink plain arrow in left inset of fig . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath21 1 ( i.e. , the case for a gapped semimetal ) , one may expect excitations between gapped and massive dirac states with lifted degeneracy , intercalated by a quasi - linear frequency dependence of @xmath2 reminiscent of the incipient dirac cones ( orange and pink plain as well as brown dashed arrows in right inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma_1_norm](c ) , respectively ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose to identify the broad absorptions at 100 and 500 @xmath7 in ybmnbi@xmath0 with the predicted van hove singularities ( orange and pink plain arrows in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma_1_norm](c ) ) . since both linear frequency dependences of @xmath2 ( blue and green dashed lines and arrows in fig [ sigma_1_norm](c ) ) , preceding the van hove singularities , cross zero on the conductivity axis at the frequency origin ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma_1_norm](a ) and ( c ) ) @xcite , we tend to believe that the magnetic term is sizable with respect to the spin - orbital contribution . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , it remains to be explained , in contrast to the theoretical predictions @xcite , why the slopes differ so much among them instead to converge on one single slope as in the case for a dirac cone . </S>",
    "<S> the feature with shoulder around 300 @xmath7 and the strongest absorption at 2500 @xmath7 in eumnbi@xmath0 identify the excitations between the gapped dirac cones , with lifted degeneracy ( orange and pink plain arrows in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma_1_norm](c ) ) . moreover , the barely perceivable linear frequency dependence of @xmath2 ( brown dashed arrow and line in fig . [ sigma_1_norm](c ) ) , intercalating both peaks , cuts the frequency axis away from the origin , which also hints to a gapped , semimetallic behavior of the electronic structure in eumnbi@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we extract @xmath22 of ybmnbi@xmath0 from the slope of @xmath2 in the low and high energy intervals , typically 30 - 90 and 200 - 400 @xmath7 respectively , where linearity is observed ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> we learn that the weyl cones are very anisotropic with @xmath22 ranging between 0.043 and 9 ev . </S>",
    "<S> our optical experiment as a momentum - averaged probe does not allow any resolution in reciprocal space ; in this respect our values for @xmath22 in both ranges and at all temperatures are reasonable , yet at the lower bound of the arpes data @xcite . our estimation may pick up the contribution by other interband transitions @xcite , not necessarily related to the weyl cones , which could also explain the different @xmath22 in both ranges . even though the estimation of @xmath22 is possible only on a reduced energy interval upon increasing the temperature @xcite </S>",
