    "recently , the top quark with a large mass has been observed at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "since the top quark is much heavier than all other known fermions , it might provide some clue to unravel the mystery of electroweak symmetry breaking . in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions ,",

    "a neutral cp - even higgs boson ( @xmath1 ) remains after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",

    "a more recent model @xcite was proposed to explain why @xmath10 is so much smaller than @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we propose that the top quark is much heavier than the other quarks and leptons , because , in the three known fermion generations , it is the only elementary fermion getting a mass from a much larger vev of a second higgs doublet .",

    "( 2 ) the ratio of the higgs vevs , @xmath0 , is naturally large in this model , which highly enhances the yukawa couplings of the lighter quarks and leptons with the higgs bosons . ( 3 ) there are flavor changing neutral higgs ( fcnh ) interactions .",
