    "in 1958 , pomeranchuk  @xcite considered stability conditions for normal _ isotropic _ fermi liquids and argued that , besides a uniform ( spin - dependent ) deformation of the fermi surface , i.e. , an itinerant ferromagnetic instability , residual quasiparticle interactions can induce a non - uniform deformation of the fermi surface . since then , an inhomogeneous deformation of a fermi surface caused by quasiparticle interactions is frequently referred to as `` pomeranchuk instability ( pi ) '' it is sometimes called `` nematic '' electron liquid  @xcite because such a fermi surface deformation can be characterized by a director order parameter which is used to describe a nematic phase in conventional liquid crystals .",
    "the nematic order introduces an anisotropy in the otherwise isotropic physical quantities , and the strong anisotropy of the longitudinal resistivity observed in a clean two - dimensional electron system under high magnetic fields was interpreted as a signal of the development of the nematic order .",
    "@xcite    in lattice systems the term pi is commonly used to refer to a fermi surface deformation which breaks the symmetry of the underlying lattice . in case of two - dimensional square lattices ,",
    "it was shown  @xcite that a pi with @xmath1 symmetry can be realized near van hove fillings , which then reduces the @xmath6 symmetry of the original fermi surface to @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "these findings have stimulated a number of further theoretical works  @xcite on the nature of a @xmath1-wave pi .",
    "recently this phase has attracted a renewed interest in several fields of solid state physics .",
    "the occurrence of a @xmath1-wave pi is hotly debated as a possible explanation for the curious phase found in the bilayer ruthenate sr@xmath3ru@xmath4o@xmath5 under strong magnetic field .",
    "@xcite also a @xmath1-wave pi may provide an explanation for the anisotropy in the magnetic excitation spectrum observed in cuprate superconductors ,  @xcite and a similar argument is ongoing in the context of new iron - pnictide superconductors .",
    "@xcite an analogous state in the spin channel was also proposed  @xcite and used to explain the so - called hidden - order phase found in uru@xmath4si@xmath4  @xcite . despite these extensive discussions , however ,",
    "an identification of such a @xmath1-wave pi is not an easy task .",
    "the problem lies in the difficulty in finding an experimental probe which couples to the order parameter of the @xmath1-wave pi . unlike a magnetic transition where we can detect the magnetic susceptibility using neutron scattering experiment ,",
    "it is hard to detect the corresponding susceptibility for a @xmath1-wave pi which occurs in the charge degrees of freedom . in ref .",
    ", it was suggested that a spatial pattern of the local density of states provides a direct probe of the @xmath1-wave pi .",
    "it is however applicable only through surface probes , a scanning tunneling microscopy , which is easily influenced by surface conditions .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have another way to identify the @xmath1-wave pi based on the _ bulk _ properties of a sample .    from the point of view that the characteristic anisotropy of a @xmath1-wave pi can be easily wiped out in a macroscopic scale by a formation of domains between two degenerate ground states [ fig .

    "the basic idea presented in this paper is that we can use phonons for the detection of the @xmath1-wave pi .",
    "this idea is based on the fact that phonons not only have a coupling to the order parameter of a @xmath1-wave pi through electron - phonon interactions , but also have a propagation - direction - selective coupling . by combining this remarkable property of phonons with a",
    "well known fact that damping of phonons ( sound attenuation ) exhibits a remarkable divergence near a second order phase transitions ,  @xcite we can pick up information on the @xmath1-wave pi .",
    "in other words , the fluctuation sound attenuation caused by a @xmath1-wave pi can be regarded as a direct probe of the unconventional charge susceptibility characterizing this ordered state .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the behavior of the fluctuation enhancement of the sound attenuation caused by a @xmath1-wave pi . for this purpose ,",
    "we use two different approaches .",
    "the first one is a phenomenological argument using a gaussian ginzburg - landau - wilson action .",
    "the second one is a microscopic analysis starting from a quasi - two - dimensional hubbard model with on - site and nearest - neighbor repulsions , which is supplemented by the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory  @xcite to treat the fluctuation effects .",
    "both approaches are shown to give the same result that there is a selection rule in the fluctuation enhancement of the sound attenuation and sound velocity softening near a @xmath1-wave pi , depending on the propagation directions and polarizations .",
    "this leads to a conclusion that we can utilize these properties to detect the @xmath1-wave pi with the aid of ultrasound measurements .",
