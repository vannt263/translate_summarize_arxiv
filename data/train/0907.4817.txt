    "nonclassicality of fields has been a topic of great interest in quantum optics and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the traditional quantum states , such as fock states and coherent states as well as squeezed states , have been generated but there are some limitations in using them for various tasks of quantum information process @xcite . alternately , it is possible to generate and manipulate various nonclassical optical fields by quantum superpositions and subtracting or adding photons from / to traditional quantum states @xcite .    on the other hand , the single mode displaced , squeezed , mixed gaussian states have been paid enough attention by both experimentalists and theoreticians .",
    "marian et .",
    "al @xcite investegated the superposition of a squeezed thermal radiation and a coherent one .",
    "they examined the squeezing properties of the field using the distribution functions of the quadratures .",
    "for gaussian squeezed states of light , a scheme is also presented experimentally to measure its squeezing , purity and entanglement @xcite .",
    "as is well known , dissipative quantum channels tend to deteriorate the degree of nonclassicality ( i.e. , render quantum features unobservable ) .",
    "thus , it is usually necessary to investigate the decoherence properties in dissipative channels , such as dynamical behaviors of the partial negativity of wigner function ( wf ) and how long a nonclassical field preserves its partial negativity of wf . for instances ,",
    "the nonclassicality of single photon - added thermal states in the thermal channel is investigated by exploring the volume of the negative part of the wf @xcite ; souza and nemes have derived an upper limit for the mixedness of the single bosonic mode gaussian states @xcite in a thermal channel .    in this paper",
    ", we shall introduce the photon - added squeezed thermo state ( pasts ) and investigate its statistical properties , such as mandel s q - parameter , number distribution , the wigner function .",
    "we then study its decoherence in a photon - loss channel in term of the negativity of wf by deriving the analytical expression of wf for pasts .",
    "it is found that the wf with single photon - added is always partial negative for the arbitrary values of @xmath0 and the squeezing parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the work is arranged as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the state pasts and derive its normalized constant , and photon number distribution is discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to calculating the wf . in the last section ,",
    "we explore the decoherence of pasts in a photon - loss channel by discussing the evolution of wf .",
    "for a displaced - squeezed thermal field , the density operator is    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4i@xmath5,$ ] are the displacement operator and the squeezing operator @xcite , respectively , @xmath6 @xmath7 = 1,$ ] and@xmath8(@xmath9 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath10 denoting temperature ) , is qualified to be a density operator of thermal ( chaotic ) field , since tr@xmath11 . for a coherent state",
    "@xmath12 @xcite , due to @xmath13 , matrix elements of any normally ordered operators @xmath14 ( the symbol @xmath15denotes normally ordering ) in the coherent state is easily obtained , i.e ,    @xmath16    so in ref.@xcite by using the weyl ordering invariance under similarity transformations and the technique of integration within an ordered product of operators ( iwop ) fan et al have converted @xmath17 to its normally ordered gaussian form    @xmath18    where @xmath19@xmath20and @xmath0 is the average photon number for @xmath21 i.e. @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the form in eq.(3 ) is similar to the bivariate normal distribution in statistics , which is useful for us to further derive the marginal distributions of @xmath17 .",
    "theoretically , the pasts can be obtained by repeatedly operating the photon creation operator @xmath23 on a displacement squeezed thermal state , so its density operator is defined as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is a non - negative integer , @xmath26tr@xmath27 is the normalization constant . using eq.([3 ] )",
    "we known immediately the normally ordered gaussian form of @xmath28 , i.e. ,    @xmath29    next we shall determine the normalization constant @xmath30 . using the completness relation of coherent states",

    "to see clearly the photon statistical properties of the pasts , we will examine the mandel s @xmath47-parameter defined as@xmath48which measures the deviation of the variance of the photon number distribution of the field state under consideration from the poissonian distribution of the coherent state .",
    "if @xmath49 we say the field has poissonian photon statistics while for @xmath50(@xmath51 ) we say that the field has super-(sub- ) poissonian photon statistics.from eq.([13 ] ) and @xmath26tr@xmath52 , we can easily calculate @xmath53 and @xmath54thus we obtain the @xmath47-parameter of the pasts    @xmath55    it is well known that the negativity of the @xmath56-parameter refers to sub - possonian statistics of the state .",
    "but a state can be nonclassical even though @xmath56 is positive .",
    "this case is true for the present state . from fig.1",
    ", one can clearly see that for the cases of @xmath57 ( fig.1(a))@xmath58 @xmath56  is always positive ; while for @xmath59 ( for instance @xmath60 ) and a given @xmath61 value , @xmath56 becomes positive only when the squeezing parameter @xmath62 is more than a certain threshold value that increases as @xmath25 increases .",
    "in addition , from fig.1(a ) and fig.1(b ) one can see that the threshold value of @xmath1 decreases as @xmath0 increases .",
    "we emphasize that the wf has negative region for all @xmath1 and @xmath0 thus the pasts is nonclassical ( see next section below ) .",

    "the pnds of pasts for some given parameters ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath25 are plotted in fig.2 . from fig .",
    "2 it is found that the pnd is constrained by @xmath80 . by adding photons , we have been able to move the peak from zero photons to nonzero photons ( see fig.2 ( a)-(c ) ) .",
    "the position of peak depends on how many photons are created and how much the state is squeezed initially .",
    "in addition , comparing fig.2(b ) and fig.2(d ) we see that , for a given @xmath25 , the tail `` of pnd becomes more wide '' with the increasing parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the wigner function ( wf ) @xcite was first introduced by wigner in 1932 to calculate quantum correction to a classic distribution function of a quantum - mechanical system .",
    "it now becomes a very popular tool to study the nonclassical properties of quantum states .",
    "it is well known that wfs are quasiprobability distributions because it may be negative in phase space @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the partial negativity of the wf is indeed a good indication of the highly nonclassical character of the state .",
    "thus , to study the dynamical behaviors of the partial negativity of wf and understand that a nonclassical field preserves its partial negativity , wigner distribution may be very desirable for experimentally quantifying the variation of nonclassicality @xcite .",
    "the presence of negativity of the wf for an optical field is a signature of its nonclassicality . in this section , using the normally ordered form of pasts , we evaluate its wf . for a single - mode system ,",

    "@xcite , whose form is normal distribution .    from eq.([27 ] ) one can see that the wf of the pasts is always real , as expected . when the factor @xmath91 in eq.([29 ] ) , the wf of the pasts with @xmath60 has its negative distribution in phase space .",
    "noticing @xmath92 always positive , this indicates that the wf of the pasts always has the negative values under the condition @xmath93 ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) at the phase space center @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 30a])-([30b ] ) into @xmath96 , we find that for the arbitrary values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the wf with @xmath60 is always partial negative .",
    "using eq.([27 ] ) , the wfs of the pasts are dipicted in phase space for several different values of @xmath97  and @xmath1  in phase space .",
    "3 exhibits the wfs of the pasts in phase space with @xmath60  for different @xmath98 , @xmath1 .",
    "it is easy to see that the wfs of single - pasts always have the negative region .",
    "the minimum in the negative region becomes larger with the increasing of @xmath0 ( see fig3.(a ) and ( c ) ) . in fig .",
    "4 , we have presented the wfs with @xmath99 , @xmath100  for different @xmath101 which indicates that the peak ( absolute ) value of wf become smaller as the increasing parameter @xmath102 .",
    "the partial negativity of wf indicates the nonclassical nature of the pasts field .",
    "when the pasts evolves in the amplitude decay channel , the evolution of the density matrix can be described by the following master equation in the interaction picture @xcite , @xmath103where @xmath104 represents the rate of decay . by using the thermal field dynamics theory and thermal entangled state representation ,",
    "the time evolution of wf at time @xmath105 to be given by the following form @xcite , i.e.,@xmath106eq.([33 ] ) is just the evolution formula of wf of single mode quantum state in photon - loss channel . by observing eq.([33 ] ) , we see that when @xmath107 @xmath108 so @xmath109 as expected .",
    "thus the wf at any time can be obtained by performing the integration when the initial wf is known .    for simplicity",

    "this result can also be checked by substituting eq.([28 ] ) into eq.(33 ) .",
    "when @xmath113 exceeds a threshold value , the wf has no chance to be negative in the whole phase space . at long time",
    "@xmath114leading to @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 the wf in eq.([35 ] ) becomes    @xmath118    which corresponds to the gaussian state . in fig.5 ,",
    "the wfs of pasts are depicted in phase space with @xmath60 and @xmath100 for several different @xmath119 .",
    "it is easily seen that the negative region of wf gradually disappears as @xmath113  increases .",
    "this implies that the system state reduces to a gaussian state after a long time interaction in the channel .",
    "thus the loss of channel causes the absence of the partial negativity of the wf if the decay time @xmath113 exceeds a threshold value .    in figs .",
    "6 , we have also presented the time - evolution of wf for different @xmath1 .",
    "one can see clearly that the partial negativity of wf decreases gradually as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the squeezing effect in one of the quadratures can be seen in fig.6 . in eq.([35 ] ) , for the pasts we have obtained the expression of the time evolution of wf . in principle , by differentiating as shown in eq.([35 ] ) we can derive the wf of other pasts ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "but its form is too complicated .",
    "however , we can draw the wigner distributions of pasts for @xmath121 by numerical simulation , as shown in fig.7 ( a)-(c ) , respectively , from which one can see that the absolute value of the negative minimum of the wf decreases as @xmath25 increases .",
    "based on the normally ordered gaussian form of displaced - squeezed thermal field , we have introduced a kind state : the photon - added squeezed thermo state ( pasts ) .",
    "then we have investigated the statistical properties of pasts ( such as mandel s q - parameter , number distribution , the wigner function ) and its decoherence in photon - loss channel with dissipative coefficient @xmath104 in term of the negativity of wf by deriving the analytical expression of wf for pasts .",
    "it is found that the photon number distribution is just a legendre polynomial and that the wf with single photon - added is always partial negative for the arbitrary values of @xmath0 and the squeezing parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the technique of integration within an ordered product of operators brings convenience in our derivation ."
