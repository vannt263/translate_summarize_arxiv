    "the investigation of frustrated magnetic systems is currently a field of active theoretical and experimental research @xcite .",
    "systems with competing nearest - neighbor ( nn ) exchange coupling @xmath0 and next nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) exchange coupling @xmath1 can serve as model systems to study the interplay of quantum effects , thermal fluctuations and frustration . the quantum @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg models on the square - lattice exhibit several ground - state phases including non - classical non - magnetic ground states , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath3 } { \\bf   s}_i\\cdot { \\bf s}_j , \\ ] ] where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 denotes nn and @xmath6 $ ] denotes nnn bonds . for antiferromagnetic nnn bonds , @xmath7 ,",
    "the spin system is frustrated irrespective of the sign of @xmath0 . due",
    "to frustration the theoretical treatment of this model is challenging .",
    "the numerous theoretical studies of the ground state phase diagram so far did not lead to a consensus on the nature of the quantum ground state and on the nature of the quantum phase transitions present in the model , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "interestingly there are also various compounds well described by square - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg models , such as oxovanadates @xcite and iron pnictides @xcite . in experiments , typically temperature - dependent quantities are reported .",
    "hence reliable ( and flexible ) tools are desirable to calculate thermodynamic quantities such as the uniform magnetic susceptibility @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we present two methods , namely the full exact diagonalization , see , e.g. , @xcite , and the high - temperature expansion @xcite to calculate the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for the square - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 spin-@xmath2 heisenberg model with both ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) nn coupling @xmath0 and afm nnn bonds @xmath1 for arbitrary spin quantum number @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we analyze the position and the height of the maximum in the susceptibility in dependence on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "uniform susceptibility @xmath8 as a function of renormalized temperature @xmath9 for nnn exchange @xmath10 and three values of the spin quantum number @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "( a ) numerical exact data for a finite square lattice of @xmath13 sites and antiferromagnetic @xmath14 .",
    "( b ) numerical exact data for a finite square lattice of @xmath13 sites and ferromagnetic @xmath15 . ( c )",

    "( d ) [ 6,4 ] pad approximant of the 10th order hte series for an infinite square lattice and antiferromagnetic @xmath14 .",
    "the order of labeling in each legend is the same as the order of the plots ( top to bottom ) . ]",
    "the full exact diagonaliazion ( ed ) yields numerical exact results at arbitrary temperature @xmath16 , but it is typically limited to about @xmath17 sites for @xmath18 models . for larger spin quantum numbers",
    "@xmath2 the system size @xmath19 accessible for ed shrinks significantly .",
    "hence , ed is used preferably for @xmath18 and @xmath20 . in the present study",
    "we exploit the special symmetry properties of the finite square - lattice of @xmath13 sites and perform full ed for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model for @xmath21 , thus allowing to study the role of the spin quantum number . since the ed approach suffers from the finite - size effect , the ed calculations do not yield quantitatively correct results for the thermodynamic limit",
    ". nevertheless , they will give insight into the qualitative behavior of the susceptibility .",
    "the high - temperature expansion ( hte ) for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model up to 10th order was presented in @xcite , however , restricted to @xmath18 .",
    "this restriction can be overcome by using our general hte scheme for heisenberg models with arbitrary exchange patterns and arbitrary spin quantum number @xmath2 up to order 8 @xcite .",
    "the scheme is encoded in a simple c++-program and can be downloaded @xcite and freely used by interested researchers .",
    "very recently the present authors have extended this general hte scheme up to 10th order @xcite .",
    "here we use this 10th order hte as an alternative method to the ed .",
    "we use here three different subsequent pad approximants , namely pad [ 4,6 ] , [ 5,5 ] , and [ 6,4 ] , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "such a pad approximant extends the region of validity of the hte series down to lower temperatures . since the hte approach is designed for infinite systems the hte data for the susceptibility maximum , in principle , can be quantitatively correct , if the maximum is not located at too low temperatures .",
    "indeed , it was found @xcite that for the unfrustrated ( @xmath22 ) square - lattice spin-@xmath23 heisenberg antiferromagnet the pad [ 4,4 ] approximant of the 8th order hte series yields correct data for the susceptibility maximum located at @xmath24 . however , it may happen that a certain pad approximant does not work for some particular values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , since pad approximants may exhibit unphysical poles for temperatures in the region of interest .",
    "hence we show in the next section only those pad data not influenced by poles .",

    "[ fig1](a - d ) is similar , there is the broad maximum in @xmath27 that is typical for a two - dimensional antiferromagnet ( note that for @xmath33 the system is in the afm ground state irrespective of the sign of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the various @xmath27 curves give an impression on the finite - size effects , the effect of the sign of the nn exchange @xmath0 , and the influence of spin quantum number @xmath2 .",
    "the height , @xmath26 , and the position , @xmath25 , of the maximum in the @xmath27 curve are interesting features for the comparison with experimental data , in particular to get information on the ratio @xmath34 from susceptibility measurements , see e.g. @xcite",
    ". therefore we will discuss @xmath26 and the @xmath25 now in more detail .",
    "we present our data for the susceptibility maximum for both fm and afm nn exchange @xmath0 in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( ed data ) and [ fig3 ] ( hte and ed data ) . for fm @xmath0 , @xmath26 ( @xmath25 ) becomes larger ( smaller ) upon lowering @xmath1 .",
    "finally , when approaching the critical value @xmath35 , where the transition to the ferromagnetic ground state takes place , @xmath26 diverges and @xmath25 goes to zero .",
    "the critical point for @xmath18 is @xmath36 for @xmath13 ( but it is @xmath37 for @xmath38 @xcite ) .",
    "it increases with growing @xmath2 and becomes latexmath:[$j^c_2=0.5    and @xmath38 are in qualitative agreement .",
    "although the finite - size effects are obviously large , the general features of @xmath26 and @xmath25 as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are quite similar .",
    "naturally the hte fails when approaching @xmath40 , since in this limit low temperatures become relevant .",
    "note that the hte data for fm @xmath0 and @xmath18 are also in qualitative agreement with recently reported data calculated by second - order green s function approach @xcite .",
    "we discuss now the case of afm @xmath0 ( right panels in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) . for large @xmath1",
    "the behavior of @xmath26 and @xmath25 is very similar to that for fm @xmath0 , i.  e.  the sign of @xmath0 becomes irrelevant , cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , for smaller values of @xmath1 naturally both cases behave completely different , since @xmath0 dominates the physics .",
    "we find a well pronounced minimum in @xmath25 in the region of strongest frustration around @xmath41 .",
    "for the finite system @xmath26 exhibits a maximum in this region , whereas for the infinite system @xmath26 is almost constant in the region @xmath42 .    to take a closer look on the role of the spin quantum number @xmath2 we present in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the quantities @xmath26 and @xmath25 as a function of @xmath43 for particular values of @xmath1 . obviously , there is monotonous increase ( decrease ) of @xmath26 ( @xmath44 ) with growing @xmath2 . for fm",
    "@xmath15 the increase of @xmath26 is particular strong for @xmath45 ( see the insets in panels a and c ) , since for large @xmath2 this value of @xmath1 becomes quite close to the transition point to the fm ground state . from figs .",
    "[ fig4](a - d ) it is also seen that the position @xmath25 of the maximum for @xmath46 is almost independent of the sign of @xmath0 , whereas the height @xmath26 strongly depends on the sign of the nn coupling .",
    "let us finally mention the special @xmath2-dependence of the maximum in @xmath27 for @xmath14 and @xmath41 , where the classical ground state exhibits a large non - trivial degeneracy .",
    "the position @xmath44 of the maximum shifts to zero in the limit @xmath47 , whereas the height remains finite .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to that found for the pyrochlore afm @xcite , where the classical ground state is also highly degenerate .",
    "using high - temperature expansion and full exact diagonalization we have calculated the uniform susceptibility @xmath8 of the spin-@xmath2 @xmath0-@xmath1 square - lattice heisenberg magnet in a wide parameter regime of fm and afm @xmath0 and frustrating afm @xmath1 .",
    "especially , we have studied the height and the position of the maximum in the @xmath27 curve as functions of @xmath48 and the spin quantum number @xmath2 .",
    "these data can be used to get information on the ratio @xmath34 from susceptibility measurements , e.g. on oxovanadates which are well described by the square - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
