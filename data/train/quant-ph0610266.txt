    "photonic de broglie wavelength of a multi - photon state is the equivalent wavelength of the whole system when all the photons in the system act as one entity .",
    "early work by jacobson _",
    "et al _ @xcite utilized a special beam splitter that sends a whole incident coherent state to either one of the outputs thus creating a schdinger - cat like state .",
    "the equivalent de broglie wavelength in this case was shown to be @xmath0 with @xmath1 as the average photon number of the coherent state .",
    "such a scheme can be used in precision phase measurement to achieve the so called heisenberg limit @xcite of @xmath2 in phase uncertainty .",
    "perhaps , the easiest way to demonstrate the de broglie wavelength is to use the maximally entangled photon number state or the so called noon state of the form @xcite @xmath3 photons in this state stick together either all in mode 1 or in mode 2 . indeed , if we recombine modes 1 and 2 and make an n - photon coincidence measurement , the coincidence rate is proportional to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the path difference between the two modes and @xmath6 is the single - photon wavelength .",
    "eq.([2 ] ) shows an equivalent de broglie wavelength of @xmath7 for @xmath8 photons .",
    "noon state of the form in eq.([1 ] ) for @xmath9 case was realized with two photons from parametric down - conversion , which led to the demonstrations of two - photon de broglie wavelength @xcite . for @xmath10 , however , it is not easy to generate the noon state .",
    "the difficulty lies in the cancellation of all the unwanted terms of @xmath11 with @xmath12 in an arbitrary n - photon entangled state of @xmath13 ) .",
    "since coincidence measurement is a projective measurement , it may not respond to all the terms in eq.([3 ] ) .",
    "indeed , wang and kobayashi @xcite applied this idea to a three - photon state and found that only the noon state part of eq.([3 ] ) contribute to a specially designed coincidence measurement with asymmetric beam splitters .",
    "the coincidence rate shows the signature dependence in the form of eq.([2 ] ) on the path difference for the three - photon de broglie wavelength .",
    "another projective scheme was recently proposed by sun _",
    "et al _ @xcite and realized experimentally by resch _",
    "et al _ @xcite for six photons and by sun _",
    "@xcite for four photons .",
    "this scheme directly projects an arbitrary n - photon state of the form in eq.([3 ] ) onto an n - photon noon state and thus can be scaled up to an arbitrary n - photon case .    in this paper",
    ", we will apply the two projective schemes to the three - photon case .",
    "the three - photon state is produced from two pairs of photons in parametric down - conversion by gating on the detection of one photon among them @xcite .",
    "we find that because of the asymmetric beam splitters , the scheme by wang and kabayashi @xcite has some residual single - photon effect under less perfect situation while the noon state projection scheme cancels all lower order effects regardless the situation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect.ii , we will discuss the scheme by wang and kobayashi @xcite and its experimental realization . in sect.iii , we will investigate the noon state projection scheme for three - photon case and implement it experimentally . in both sections",
    ", we will deal with a more realistic multi - mode model to cover the imperfect situations .",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "this scheme for three - photon case was first proposed by wang and kobayashi @xcite to use asymmetric beam splitter to cancel the unwanted @xmath14 or @xmath15 term and is a generalization of the hong - ou - mandel interferometer @xcite for two - photon case . but different from the two - photon case , the state for phase sensing is not a three - photon noon state since only one unwanted term can be cancelled and there is still another one left there .",
    "so a special arrangement has to be made in the second beam splitter to cancel the contribution from the other term .",
    "the following is the detail of the scheme .",
    "we first start with a single mode argument by wang and kobayashi .",
    "the input state is a three - photon state of @xmath16 .",
    "the three photons are incident on an asymmetric beam splitter ( bs1 ) with @xmath17 from two sides as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the output state can be easily found from the quantum theory of a beam splitter as @xcite    @xmath18    when @xmath19 , the @xmath20 term disappears from eq.([4 ] ) due to three - photon interference and eq.([4 ] ) becomes @xmath21 but unlike the two - photon case , the @xmath22 term is still in eq.([5 ] ) so that the output state is not a noon state of the form in eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "now we can arrange a projection measurement to take out the @xmath23 term in eq.([5 ] ) .",
    "let us combine @xmath24 and @xmath25 with another beam splitter ( bs2 in fig.1 ) that has same transmissivity and reflectivity ( @xmath19 ) as the first bs ( bs1 ) . according to eq.([5 ] )",
    ", @xmath22 will not contribute to the probability @xmath26 .",
    "so only @xmath27 and @xmath28 in eq.([5 ] ) will contribute .",
    "the projection measurement of @xmath26 will cancel the unwanted middle terms like @xmath29 from eq.([5 ] ) .",
    "although the coefficients of @xmath27 and @xmath30 in eq.([5 ] ) are not equal , their contributions to @xmath26 are the same after considering the unequal @xmath31 and @xmath32 in bs2 . so the projection measurement of @xmath26 is responsive only to the three - photon noon state .",
    "use of an asymmetric beam splitter for the cancellation of @xmath22 was discussed by sanaka _ et al _ in fock state filtering @xcite .",
    "the above argument can be confirmed by calculating the three - photon coincidence rate @xmath26 directly for the scheme in fig.1 , which is proportional to @xcite : @xmath33 with @xmath34 where we introduce a phase @xmath35 between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "but for the first bs , we have @xmath36 substituting eq.([7 ] ) into eq.([6 ] ) with eq.([8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath37 which has a dependence on the path difference @xmath38 that is same as in eq.([2 ] ) but with @xmath39 .",
    "experimentally , asymmetric beam splitters are realized via polarization projections as shown in fig.2 and its inset ( a ) , where a three - photon state of @xmath40 is incident on a combination of two half wave plates ( hwp1 , hwp2 ) and a phase retarder ( ps ) . the first half wave plate ( hwp1 )",
    "rotates the state @xmath40 by an angle @xmath41 to @xmath42 with @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the amplitude transmissivity of the asymmetric beam splitter .",
    "eq.([10 ] ) is equivalent to eq.([7 ] ) .",
    "the phase retarder ( ps ) introduces the phase shift @xmath35 between the h and v polarization . the second half wave plate ( hwp2 )",
    "makes another rotation of the same angle @xmath45 for the two phase - shifted polarizations and the polarization beam splitter finishes the projection required by eq.([8 ] ) .",
    "the three - photon polarization state of @xmath40 is prepared by using two type - ii parametric down conversion processes shown in fig.2 .",
    "this scheme was first constructed by liu _",
    "et al _ @xcite to demonstrate controllable temporal distinguishability of three photons .",
    "when the delay between the two h - photons is zero , we have the state of @xmath40 . in this scheme ,",
    "two @xmath46-barium borate ( bbo ) crystals are pumped by two uv pulses from a common source of frequency doubled ti : sapphire laser operating at 780 nm .",
    "the h - photon from bbo1 is coupled to the h - polarization mode of bbo2 while the other v - photon is detected by detector d and serves as a trigger .",
    "the h- and v - photons from bbo2 are coupled to single - mode fibers and then are combined by a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the combined fields pass through an interference filter with 3 nm bandwidth and then go to the assembly of hwp1 , ps , and hwp2 to form a three - photon polarization interferometer .",
    "there are two schemes of projection measurement . in this section",
    ", we deal with the first scheme in inset ( a ) of fig.2 , which consists of a pbs for projection and three detectors ( a , b , c ) for measuring the quantity @xmath47 in eq.([6 ] ) by three - photon coincidence . to realize the transformation in eqs.([7 ] , [ 8 ] ) , hwp1 and hwp2 are set to rotate the polarization by @xmath48 .",
    "in order to obtain an input state of @xmath40 to the interferometer , we need to gate the three - photon coincidence measurement on the detection at detector d. in this way , we ensure that the two h - photons come from two crystals separately .",
    "otherwise , we will have an input state of @xmath49 . the delay ( @xmath50 ) between the two h - photons from bbo1 and bbo2 as well as the delay ( @xmath51 ) between the h- and v - photons",
    "are adjusted to insure the three photons are indistinguishable in time .",
    "this is confirmed by the photon bunching effect of the two h - photons @xcite and a generalized hong - ou - mandel effect for three photons @xcite .     with @xmath52 and @xmath53 after background subtraction .",
    ", width=302 ]    four - photon coincidence count among abcd detectors is measured as a function of the phase shift @xmath35 .",
    "the experimental result after background subtraction is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the data is gathered in 100 sec for each point and the error bars are one standard deviation",
    ". backgrounds due to three and more pairs of photons are estimated from single and two - photon rates to contribute 1.2/sec on average to the raw data and are subtracted .",
    "the data clearly show a @xmath54 dependence except the unbalanced minima and maxima , which indicates an extra @xmath55 dependence . indeed",
    ", the data fit well to the function @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath60 of the fit is 30 and is comparable to the number of data of 25 , indicating a mostly statistical cause for the error .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath55 term in eq.([11 ] ) is an indication that the cancellation of the @xmath29 and @xmath61 is not complete in eqs.([4 ] , [ 9 ] ) and the residuals mix with the @xmath62 and @xmath63 terms to produce the @xmath55 term .",
    "this imperfect cancellation is not a result of the wrong @xmath64 values but is due to temporal mode mismatch among the three photons in the input state of @xmath40 . to account for this mode mismatch , we resort to a multi - mode model of the parametric down - conversion process .",
    "we start by finding the multi - mode description of the quantum state from two parametric down - conversion processes .",
    "since the first one serves as the input to the second one , we need the evolution operator for the process , which was first dealt with by ghosh _",
    "et al _ @xcite and later by ou @xcite and by grice and walmsley @xcite . in general , the unitary evolution operator for weakly pumped type - ii process is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is some parameter that is proportional to the pump strength and nonlinear coupling .",
    "for simplicity without losing generality , we assume the two processes are identical and are governed by the evolution operator in eq.([12 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume the symmetry relation @xmath67 which is in general not satisfied but can be achieved with some symmetrizing tricks @xcite .",
    "so for the first process , because the input is vacuum , we obtain the output state as    @xmath68    the second crystal has the state of @xmath69 as its input .",
    "so after the second crystal , the output state becomes @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the two non - overlapping vertical polarization mode from the first and second crystals , respectively .",
    "here we only keep the four - photon term .",
    "although there are other four - photon terms in the @xmath73 state corresponding to two - pair generation from one crystal alone , they wo nt contribute to what we are going to calculate .",
    "so we omit them in eq.([14 ] ) .",
    "the field operators at the four detectors are given by @xmath74/\\sqrt{2}+ ...",
    "= \\hat e_c(t ) , \\end{cases } \\label{15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath75 . here",
    "we used the equivalent relations in eqs.([7 ] , [ 8 ] ) to establish the connection between the field operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 and for detector d , we have @xmath78 with @xmath79    the four - photon coincidence rate of abcd is proportional to a time integral of the correlation function    @xmath80    it is easy to first evaluate @xmath81 : @xmath82/2 + ... , \\label{19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 for short and we keep the time ordering of @xmath86 .",
    "we also drop five terms that give zero result when they operate on @xmath73 .",

    ", we always have @xmath98 by schwartz inequality .",
    "when @xmath99 , eq.([23 ] ) has the same form as eq.([11 ] ) , indicating that the multi - mode analysis indeed correctly predicts the imperfect cancellation of the @xmath40 and @xmath100 terms in eqs.([4 ] , [ 9 ] ) .",
    "if we use the experimentally measured @xmath101 and @xmath102 in eq.([24 ] ) , we will obtain two inconsistent values of @xmath103 : @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the discrepancy is the result of the break up of the symmetry relation of @xmath106 for type - ii parametric down - conversion , which is reflected in the less - than - unit visibility of the two - photon interference .",
    "this imperfection can be modelled as spatial mode mismatch and approximately modifies eq.([24 ] ) as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the equivalent reduced visibility in single - photon interference due to spatial mode mismatch . with the extra parameter @xmath108 in eq.([27 ] ) , we obtain a consistent @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "the projection measurement discussed in the previous section relies on the cancellation of some specific terms and therefore can not be applied to an arbitrary photon number . in the following , we will discuss another projection scheme that can cancel all the unwanted terms at once and thus can be scaled up .",
    "the noon - state projection measurement scheme was first proposed by sun _",
    "et al _ @xcite and realized by resch _",
    "et al _ @xcite for six - photon case and by sun _",
    "@xcite for the four - photon case .",
    "since it is based on a multi - photon interference effect , it was recently used to demonstrate the temporal distinguishability of an n - photon state @xcite . here",
    "we will apply it to a three - photon superposition state for the demonstration of three - photon de broglie wave length without the noon state .",
    "the noon - state projection measurement scheme for three - photon case is sketched in inset ( b ) of fig.1 . in this scheme ,",
    "the input field is first divided into three equal parts .",
    "then each part passes through a phase retarder that introduces a relative phase difference of @xmath111 respectively between the h- and v - polarization .",
    "the phase shifted fields are then projected to @xmath112 direction by polarizers before being detected by a , b , c detectors , respectively .",
    "it was shown that the three - photon coincidence rate is proportional to @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "note that since @xmath116 are orthogonal to the noon - state , their contributions to @xmath117 are zero .",
    "assuming that @xmath118 and there is a relative phase of @xmath35 between h and v so that @xmath119 , we obtain from eq.([28 ] ) @xmath120 which is exactly in the form of eq.([2 ] ) with @xmath39 , showing the three - photon de broglie wave length .      from sect.iib , we learned that a state of @xmath40 can be produced with two parametric down - conversion processes .",
    "this state will of course give no contribution to the noon state projection since it is orthogonal to the noon state . on the other hand",
    ", we can rotate the state by 45@xmath121 .",

    "the phase shifter ( ps ) then introduces a relative phase difference @xmath35 between the h and v polarizations and hwp2 is set at zero before the noon state projection measurement is performed [ inset ( b ) of fig.2 ] .",
    "as before , a four - photon coincidence measurement among abcd detectors is equivalent to a three - photon coincidence measurement by abc detectors gated on the detection at d , which is required for the production of @xmath40 .     with @xmath123 after background subtraction.,width=302 ]",
    "four - photon coincidence count among abcd detectors is registered in 200 sec as a function of the phase @xmath35 ( ps ) .",
    "the data after subtraction of background contributions is plotted in fig.4 .",
    "it clearly shows a sinusoidal dependence on @xmath35 with a period of @xmath124 . the solid curve is a chi - square fit to the function of @xmath125 $ ] with @xmath126sec and @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath60 of the fit is 24.3 , which is comparable to the number of data of 25 indicating a good statistical fit .",
    "the less - than - unit visibility is a result of temporal distinguishability among the three photons produced from two crystals .",
    "it can only be accounted for with a multi - mode model of the state given in sect.iic .",
    "let s now apply it to the current scheme .",

    "the field operator for detector d is same as eq.([16 ] ) .    as in sect.iic ,",
    "the four - photon coincidence rate is related to the correlation function in eq.([18 ] ) and we can first evaluate @xmath130 . with the field operators in eq.([31 ] ) , we obtained @xmath131 with @xmath132 where the notations are same as in eq.([19 ] ) and we used the identity @xmath133 .",
    "as before , we also drop five terms that give zero result when they operate on @xmath73 .",

    "after the time integral , we obtain @xmath138 with @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are given in eqs.([25 ] , [ 26 ] ) .",
    "note that the terms such as @xmath142 are absent in eq.([37 ] ) even in the non - ideal case of @xmath143 .",
    "this is because of the symmetry among the three detectors a , b , c involved in the three - photon noon state projection measurement .",
    "when spatial mode mismatch is considered , the visibility is changed to @xmath144 with @xmath108 and the quantity @xmath103 obtained in sect.iic , we have @xmath145 , which is close to the observed value of 0.84 in sect.iiib .",
    "in summary , we demonstrate a three - photon de broglie wavelength by using two different schemes of projection measurement without the need for a hard - to - produce noon state . quantum interference is responsible for the cancellation of the unwanted terms .",
    "the first scheme by asymmetric beam splitters targets specific terms while the second one by noon state projection cancels all the unwanted terms at once .",
    "we use a multi - mode model to describe the non - ideal situation encountered in the experiment and find good agreements with the experimental results .",
    "since the scheme by asymmetric beam splitters is only for some specific terms , it can not be easily scaled up to arbitrary number of photons although the extension to the four - photon case is available .",
    "the extension of the scheme by noon state projection to arbitrary number of photons is straightforward .",
    "in fact , demonstrations with four and six photons have been done with simpler states @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the scheme of noon state projection need to divide the input fields into @xmath8 equal parts while the scheme with asymmetric beam splitters requires less partition .",
    "so the latter will have higher coincidence rate than the former .",
    "in fact , fig.3 and fig.4 show a ratio of 4 after pump intensity correction .",
    "this is consistent with the ratio of 4.8 from eqs.([23 ] , [ 36 ] ) when @xmath146 .",
    "the difference may come from the different collection geometry in the layout .",
    "the dependence of the visibility in eqs.([27 ] , [ 37 ] ) on the quantity @xmath147 reflects the fact that the interference effect depends on the temporal indistinguishability of the three photons . from previous studies",
    "@xcite , we learned that the quantity @xmath147 is a measure of indistinguishability between two pairs of photons in parametric down - conversion . in our generation of the @xmath148 state , one of the h - photon is from another pair of down - converted photons .",
