    "@xcite recently , the zeeman splitting and spin susceptibility of interacting 2d carrier systems have been a subject of renewed interest , @xcite fueled by the promise of a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic ground state transition at very low densities , @xcite and the possibility that the spin polarization is related to the apparent metal - insulator transition in dilute 2d systems .",

    "furthermore , the spin polarization of holes is important in the context of ferromagnetic semiconductors such as gamnas where it is known that the ferromagnetism is mediated by the itinerant valence band holes .",
    "@xcite we show here that the spin susceptibility of 2dhss depends dramatically on the shape of the confining potential .",
    "moreover , we find that , in contrast to their 2d electron counterparts , dilute 2dhss exhibit no significant enhancement of the spin susceptibility as compared with calculations which neglect exchange - correlation .",
