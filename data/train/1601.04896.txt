    "<S> fortunately , the best classical algorithms known scale worse than polynomially in the number of bits of @xmath4 : by now , the building blocks of the cyberinfrastructure still resist .    </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , in the quantum world , factoring is an easy problem that requires only polynomial resources using shor s algorithm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this amazing result raises new questions about the relationship between quantum mechanics and number theory and , more generally , with physics ; a connection dating back to plya and hilbert  @xcite , who laid a program to prove riemann s hypothesis through the spectrum of physical operators . </S>",
    "<S> however , the physical realization of shor s algorithm is still limited to proof of concept demonstrations , far away from factoring numbers of the size used in real - world cryptosystems .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative would be to build the solutions in hilbert space of a quantum simulator performing factorization , instead of going through the route of a gate - based , fully programmable , quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> the key idea , following the pioneering suggestions of feynman  @xcite , is to translate factoring arithmetics into the physics of a device whose superposition of states mimics the problem i.e. : a factoring ( analog ) computer . </S>",
    "<S> the states of the simulator would be the solutions of some hermitian operator depending only on the number that we want to factorize . </S>",

    "<S> the cardinality of the factorization ensemble is thus important , since , given this interpretation , it is the dimension of the hilbert space associated to the observable . it can be derived  @xcite as a corollary of theorem 437 in @xcite for the special case of the product of two primes .    </S>",

    "<S> note how @xmath118 fits perfectly to the best analytical approximation given by @xmath3 for @xmath2 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : u_parabolic ] is just an element required for the calculations ; it was obtained specifically to match , using the simplest possible polynomial , the function @xmath104 in terms of the statistics of the primes in @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath123 must exists  independently of our approximations  and , according to the distribution of prime factor cadidates in the ensemble , should be a stepwise function .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we introduced new concepts and arithmetic functions that could play a significant role in the quantum factorization problem . </S>",
    "<S> the factorization ensemble is the main one ; it allows us to bind the hamiltonian of a quantum factoring simulator . </S>",
    "<S> then , we have reformulated the factorization problem to that of finding a new parameter of the problem : the arithmetic function @xmath21 ; it corresponds to the energy eigenvalues of the simulator . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the spectrum of the simulator gives in the semiclassical quantization regime  </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : quantization ] ) for the coprime factor @xmath125 will work . </S>",
    "<S> the next step will be to find out a suitable physical system , described by this hamiltonian , to which the boundary conditions can be applied . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the system will provide the e values that , through the inverse of the quantum conditions found in this paper , will finally give the factors .    as a final remark </S>",
    "<S> , this work supports indirectly plya and hilbert program@xcite to prove riemann s hypothesis : the spectrum of the imaginary part of the zeros of @xmath126 should be eigenvalues of an hermitian operator . </S>",
    "<S> this being true , it will imply , according to riemann , the statistics of the primes @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> here we evaluated @xmath24  an eigenvalue of an hermitian operator obtaining an approximation to @xmath20 for the primes in @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that , perhaps , the truth of riemann s hypothesis could be found with the help of the functions and the approach introduced in this work , particularly- let s speculate with the physics of the hypothesis  @xcite- if the contributions of @xmath127 , for @xmath128 to the spectrum of the energies of the simulator were correlated with those obtained for the arithmetic function @xmath21 , computed from the zeros of @xmath126 on the critical line .    </S>",
