    "a two - dimensional electron gas in a strong perpendicular magnetic field has an insulating bulk and a conducting edge . while the conductance @xmath1 for transport along the edge is quantized in units of @xmath0 , the conductance @xmath2 for transport between opposite edges",
    "is strongly suppressed .",
    "this is the regime of the ( integer ) quantum hall effect.@xcite upon variation of magnetic field or fermi energy , a transition occurs in which @xmath1 varies from one quantized plateau to the next , accompanied by a peak in @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum hall plateau transition is not smooth , but exhibits fluctuations reminiscent of the universal conductance fluctuations in metals.@xcite in small samples the fluctuations take the form of sharp peaks , due to resonant scattering between opposite edges mediated by quasi - bound states in the bulk.@xcite in larger samples the intermediate states form a percolating network at the plateau transition , resulting in a smooth peak in @xmath2 with rapid fluctuations superimposed.@xcite    the conductance fluctuations are typically analyzed in a context that emphasises their random , sample - specific nature.@xcite here we wish to point out one feature of these fluctuations that has a sample - independent _ topological _ origin .",
    "the quantum hall plateau transition is a topological phase transition , because a topological quantum number @xmath3 changes from one plateau to the next.@xcite we show that a change in @xmath3 is associated with a resonance in the amplitude @xmath4 of the magnetoconductance oscillations in a ring ( corbino ) geometry .",
    "each unit increment of @xmath3 corresponds to a resonant amplitude @xmath5 ( times spin degeneracies ) .",

    "these show , in particular , that the plateau transition in a disordered system is reentrant : there are multiple increments of @xmath3 , alternatingly @xmath6 and @xmath7 , each associated with an @xmath0 resonance in @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] by showing that the critical exponent of the phase transition can be extracted from the sample - size dependence of the width of the resonance , in a way which preserves information on which side of the phase transition one is located .",

    "to isolate @xmath2 from @xmath1 we consider a corbino geometry , see fig .",
    "[ fig : corbino ] , consisting of a ring - shaped two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) connected to an electrode at the inner and outer perimeters .",
    "the two - terminal conductance @xmath8 is then fully due to the current @xmath9 through the bulk , without contributions from the currents circulating along the edges .",

    "the conductance then oscillates periodically as a function of @xmath28 , with amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "( we will examine in the next section to what extent this applies to the realistic situation of a uniform magnetic field . )",
    "if the @xmath28-dependence of @xmath16 is continued analytically to arbitrary complex @xmath31 , the winding number @xmath32 equals the difference of the number of zeros and poles of @xmath33 inside the unit circle @xmath34 .",
    "a pole may annihilate a zero , but the difference @xmath35 can only change when a pole or zero crosses the unit circle .",
    "unitarity of the scattering matrix requires @xmath36 for real @xmath28 , so poles can not cross the unit circle . a topological phase transition , corresponding to a change in @xmath3 , is therefore signaled by a zero of @xmath33 crossing the unit circle,@xcite see fig .  [ fig : zero ] .",

    "the strict @xmath59 flux periodicity of the magnetoconductance is broken in a realistic setting by the penetration of the flux through the conducting region , but we have shown by numerical simulations that the resonances are still clearly observable .    the theory presented here may motivate an experimental search for the reentrant phase transition that we observed in our simulations . existing experiments@xcite in a gaas corbino disc show a maximal amplitude of about @xmath66 in the @xmath67 plateau transition , an order of magnitude below the predicted value",
    ". this may partly be due to limited phase coherence , and partly to the self - averaging effect of overlapping resonances . in the experimental geometry the entire inner and outer perimeters of the corbino disc",

    "the integration over @xmath28 can be avoided by going to the complex @xmath31 plane and counting the number of zeros and poles of @xmath33 in the unit circle .",
    "the difference @xmath35 then directly gives @xmath3 .      to perform the analytic continuation to complex flux we cut the disc as indicated in fig .",
