    "to date , the highest plasma beta among stellarators  about 5%have been obtained in w7-as @xcite and in lhd @xcite .",
    "neither plasma was found to be unstable , implying even higher stability limits in those devices .",
    "therefore , to date analytical and numerical investigations of ballooning modes @xcite and other high-@xmath0 instabilities @xcite have only received partial validation by experiment : experiments confirmed certain values of @xmath0 to be stable , but could not verify whether even higher values were unstable@xcite . experimental access to the stellarator @xmath0 limit and experimental characterization of instabilities would finally enable comparison with theory , improve our understanding and predictive capability . in turn , this could lead to more compact and efficient stellarator reactor designs , currently assuming volume - averaged beta @xmath1 3 - 6% @xcite .",
    "in fact , the main optimization criterion in the helias reactor is to maintain a stability limit @xmath2 while reducing the pfirsch - schlter currents and shafranov shift @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", it is argued that the cnt stellarator at columbia university ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) is uniquely well - suited for this research .",
    "the device , originally constructed to study non - neutral and pure - electron plasmas @xcite , has since been repurposed to investigate quasi - neutral plasmas , and has addressed issues relevant to magnetic fusion energy such as error - field diagnosis @xcite and processing of stellarator images @xcite . from the point of view of high @xmath0 stability ,",
    "cnt is attractive for two main reasons : ( 1 ) it could reach high values of @xmath0 by deploying relatively small amounts of heating power and ( 2 ) its stability limit is expected to be lower and thus more easily accessible than in other devices .    regarding the first point , the cnt magnetic field is low : in general @xmath3 t , but @xmath4 t was adopted for this work . as a result , the magnetic pressure @xmath5 is very low , and more amenable plasma pressures ( 2500 times lower than in a 5 t reactor , if not smaller ) suffice to reach high @xmath0 .",
    "the need for high plasma pressure will require heating at high density",
    ". in this regard , overdense plasma heating , at densities in excess of four times the cutoff density , was recently observed in cnt by injecting 10 kw microwaves at 2.45 ghz . increasing the heating power would result in high power densities in the small cnt plasma ( @xmath6 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the small size of cnt is co - responsible for poor energy confinement .",
    "even so , scaling - law calculations to be presented in this paper suggest that a few hundred kw of microwave power will be sufficient for high @xmath0 .    regarding the second point , cnt is a classical , non - optimized stellarator . in particular",
    ", it was not optimized for high stability , making its stability limit lower and easier to access .",
    "an interesting competing effect might arise from the cnt low aspect ratio , a @xmath7 1.9 .",
    "this characteristic , relatively under - explored in stellarators , increased the stability limit in spherical tokamaks and favored the achievement of higher @xmath0 compared to tokamaks * ? ? ? * .",
    "it is interesting to verify whether the low aspect ratio has a similar beneficial effect on stellarator stability , although evidence presented below suggests this not to be the case , at least not for cnt .",
    "this paper describes a numerical investigation of high-@xmath0 equilibria that are attainable in the cnt configuration .",
    "equilibria are calculated using the vmec code @xcite and evaluated for stability using cobravmec.@xcite the structure is as follows : sec .",
    "[ sect : fixedbdry ] briefly overviews considerations for calculating vmec equilibria in the cnt configuration and presents some fixed - boundary results .",

    "vmec may assume a fixed or free plasma boundary depending on the purpose of the calculation . in fixed - boundary mode ,",
    "the plasma boundary is assumed to be known _",
    "ab initio _ and the full magnetic field is determined in the calculation without knowledge of the external coils . in free - boundary mode , the coil configuration and the field that it generates are known and the plasma boundary is solved for by using an energy principle.@xcite free - boundary mode was used in this work because the shape of the plasma boundary was expected to vary with @xmath0 and plasma current .    as an initial test of concept",
    ", however , a number of high-@xmath0 calculations were performed in fixed - boundary mode for cnt - like configurations .",
    "one example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fixedbdry ] . in this case , the boundary was set to conform to the last closed flux surface ( lcfs ) obtained from vacuum field line calculations with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "the electron temperature profile was chosen to resemble the corresponding temperature measurements .",
    "for equilibria with the peaked pressure profiles , since no corresponding experimental data are available , temperature profiles were assumed to be flat .",
    "as cnt does not employ any direct ion heating mechanisms , the ion temperature was assumed to be 0.3 times the electron temperature at all locations .",
    "furthermore , because the low-@xmath0 plasmas currently produced in cnt are already overdense to 2.45 ghz electron cyclotron waves by factors of up to 4 ( for electron temperatures of @xmath28 5 ev ) , further increases in @xmath0 were assumed to be driven by proportional increases in temperature ( as opposed to increases in density ) . with effective charge assumed to be 1 , the particle densities then followed from the temperatures and the plasma pressure profile .",

    "repeat steps 2 - 4 until either : ( 1 ) vmec fails to descend robustly to an equilibrium solution or ( 2 ) the solution is not stable to ballooning instabilities , as determined below .",
    "each self - consistent equilibrium was evaluated for ballooning stability by the cobravmec code , which computed growth rates on a grid of 1620 locations ( 15 toroidal @xmath32 18 poloidal @xmath32 6 radial ) throughout the plasma volume .",

    "we estimate @xmath60 using the iss04 scaling law @xcite :    @xmath61    we use the plasma minor radius @xmath62 , major radius @xmath63 , magnetic field @xmath52 , and rotational transform @xmath64 ( evaluated at two - thirds the minor radius of the lcfs ) from the high - performance configuration presented in sec .",
    "[ sect : highbeta_results ] .",
    "the heating power @xmath57 ( in mw in this formula ) is treated as an independent variable .",
    "it should be noted that the values of @xmath63 , @xmath52 , and line - averaged electron density @xmath65 ( in units of @xmath66 ) , are lower in cnt than in other devices which @xmath67 is based upon .",
    "said otherwise , the scaling law is being extrapolated here .",
    "furthermore , @xmath68 is determined based on current - free or nearly current - free plasmas , whereas the high-@xmath0 , low - aspect - ratio equilibria evaluated in this paper contain a small but finite bootstrap current .",
    "the renormalization coefficient , @xmath69 , is a device - specific fitting parameter . among the stellarators in the database",
    "used to determine the scaling law , this value ranged from 0.25 for tj - ii to unity for a configuration of w7-as .",
    "this parameter has not been calculated for cnt .",
    "however , it was observed that the parameter was inversely correlated with toroidal effective ripple , @xmath70 .",
    "this tendency follows from the association of greater ripple with a larger population of helically trapped particles .",
    "in particular , @xmath71 ( evaulated at two - thirds of the minor radius ) was found to relate to @xmath69 roughly as @xmath72 for values of @xmath71 between 0.02 and 0.4.@xcite for cnt , a value of @xmath71 of 1.6 was calculated for the configuration @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",

    ", we adopt thid lowest , most pessimistic value , @xmath75 , for a conservative estimate of @xmath60 .    @xmath60 is evaluated in two main regimes of electron density density @xmath65 : the first is the highest attainable before the plasma radiatively collapses , determined through a formula derived by sudo,@xcite    @xmath76    a similar formula was derived at w7-as @xcite and yields similar results , not shown for brevity .",
    "the second is the cutoff density above which microwaves for ecrh can not propagate . for heating at the fundamental harmonic in the ordinary mode at frequency @xmath77 ghz ,",
    "this is    @xmath78    for heating at the second harmonic in the extraordinary mode using the same heating frequency ( and , therefore , half the field ) , the highest density that admits propagation corresponds to the left - handed cutoff , effectively a factor of 3/2 above the ordinary - mode cutoff :    @xmath79    results of these calculations are shown in fig .",

    "thus , the blue - shaded region below the curve for @xmath80 is accessible by underdense plasmas , and the red - shaded region between @xmath81 and @xmath82 corresponds to @xmath0 values that are accessible assuming overdense microwave heating .",
    "thus , the high - performance configuration with @xmath83 can not be attained with @xmath84 mw if the plasma remains underdense , but might be possible with heating powers as low as @xmath28 200 kw if the plasma may become overdense .     at different levels of heating power according to stellarator scaling laws for the high - performance configuration .",
    "intersections of @xmath0 and heating power above the solid line are considered inaccessible because the plasma density exceeds theoretical and empirical limits for stellarators .",

    "the foregoing work has established that ballooning - stable equilibria with average @xmath0 values of up to 3.7% should be attainable in cnt , under the assumption that the plasma current is dominated by the bootstrap current . furthermore , the no ballooning - stability limit was found for the configuration with the @xmath85 , indicating that either higher @xmath0 may be possible or the limit is determined by other phenomena .",
    "the limitations on stability depend on the magnetic configuration , with the @xmath39 coil orientation capable of nearly 20% higher @xmath0 than the other two tilt angles .",
    "stability also depends on the pressure profile and the associated bootstrap current profile : plasmas with peaked pressure profiles for the same @xmath10 and @xmath14 may become unstable at @xmath86 .",
    "these stability limits are lower than in other stellarators , and thus more easily accessible .",
    "additionally , stellarator scaling laws indicate that @xmath85 should be attainable with 2.45 ghz microwaves at powers as little as 200 kw , as long as overdense heating mechanisms may be employed .    the equilibrium parameters and bootstrap current profile",
    "were obtained using experimental temperature and pressure profiles from overdense cnt plasmas heated with less than 10 kw .",
    "a self - consistent estimate of the maximum stable @xmath0 would require that , instead of the profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : presprof ] , we use for the stability calculations a pressure profile as close as possible to what we would obtain for 200 kw heating . in turn , this would require full - wave and fokker - planck modeling , which is left as future work .",
    "full - wave modeling is necessary , instead of a computationally less expensive ray- or beam - tracing , due to the spatial scales of the problem ( _ i.e. _ , the plasma minor radius is similar to the microwave vacuum wavelength , complicating the application of simpler ray - tracing approaches ) .",
