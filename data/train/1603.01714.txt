    "this problem is even more striking when placing the stm tip above the hollow surface position , where we obtained 1.5 mev/@xmath115a at @xmath116 based on the linear fit but a maximal value of 0.566 mev/@xmath115a is found at @xmath108 and 5 in the direct stt efficiency calculation .",
    "again , by tuning the tip - sample distance a perfect agreement with the experimental value could be achieved .",
    "nevertheless , our most important finding is that the stt efficiency can be enhanced by about a factor of seven from 1.369 ( at -0.2 v and @xmath108 ) to 9.706 mev/@xmath115a ( at 0.8 v and @xmath117 ) by changing the bias voltage and @xmath13 compared to the experimentally used voltage of -0.2 v @xcite .",
    "all reported characteristics of the tip - sample - distance - dependent ( determined by mostly geometric effect ) and the bias - voltage - dependent ( determined by mostly electronic structure effect ) stt efficiencies are due to the complex interplay of the orbital - dependent tunneling ( determined by the geometry of the stm junction ) and the involved spin - polarized electronic structures of the sample surface and the stm tip .",
    "we anticipate that most of the reported effects can generally be found and utilized in other magnetic stm junctions as well .",
    "moreover , we suggest that by changing the tip material the bias - dependent stt efficiencies could be further enhanced . this can be a topic of future research .",
    "we have introduced a method for a combined calculation of charge and vector spin transport of elastically tunneling electrons in magnetic scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "the method is based on the three - dimensional wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( 3d - wkb ) approach combined with electronic structure calculations using first principles density functional theory . employing the model ,",
    "we have analyzed the stm contrast inversion of the charge current above the fe / w(110 ) surface depending on the bias voltage , tip - sample distance and relative magnetization orientation between the sample and an iron tip .",
    "we have demonstrated the tunability of the atomic contrast inversion in stm images depending on the contributing spin channels .",
    "for the spin transfer torque ( stt ) vector we have found that its in - plane component is generally larger than the out - of - plane component , and we identified a longitudinal spin current component , which , however , does not contribute to the torque . we have shown that the stt vectors depend on the lateral and vertical stm tip positions even above a clean ( defect - free ) planar ferromagnetic surface .",
    "our results suggest that the torque - current relationship in magnetic stm junctions follows the power law rather than a linear function .",
    "consequently , we have shown that the ratio between the stt and the spin - polarized charge current is not constant , and more importantly , it can be tuned by the bias voltage , tip - sample distance and magnetization rotation .",
    "we found that the stt efficiency can be enhanced by about a factor of seven by selecting a proper bias voltage .",
    "thus , we demonstrated the possible enhancement of the stt efficiency in magnetic stm junctions , which can be exploited in technological applications .",
    "we discussed our results in view of the indirect measurement of the stt above the fe / w(110 ) surface reported by krause _",
