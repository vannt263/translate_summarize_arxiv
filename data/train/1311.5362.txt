    "the approach is known to provide closed ( or integral ) form expressions for important performance metrics averaged out over such large random networks .",
    "we consider here a specific scheme of cooperation with coherent transmission , where at most two bss can serve a single user .",
    "the scheme is based on the ideas of conferencing and user - power splitting .",
    "it originates from the seminal work of willems @xcite for the @xmath0 cooperative multiple access channel ( mac ) and its gaussian variant in @xcite .",
    "an adaptation of the idea in a network - mimo setting is proposed by zakhour and gesbert for the @xmath1 model in @xcite , where the beamforming vectors take the role of signal weights and define the power - split ratios .",
    "our problem position within the framework of stochastic geometry , extends previous work by andrews , baccelli and ganti @xcite to include cooperative schemes .",
    "more specifically , for the service of each user , either one or two bss are involved ( section [ sii ] ) .",
    "if two , these cooperate by exchange of information with conferencing over some backhaul link .",
    "we assume that , in addition to the user data , only part of the total channel state is available and exchanged .",
    "we choose to analyze schemes with partial knowledge in order to investigate possible benefits of cooperation without the excessive costs from full channel adaptation .",
    "specifically , only the phase of the channel from the second closest transmitter to the user is known , while the first bs is informed over this and transmits coherently by appropriate choice of its own phase .",
    "the scheme considers a fixed transmission power budget per user - which is split between the two bss and a common message is encoded .",
    "the two transmitted common signals add up in - phase at the user receiver , resulting in an extra term for the beneficial signal ( section [ siii ] ) . later in the work , extra knowledge of the interference from the second bs neighbour to the reference user",
    "is considered available .",
    "the cooperative pair then transmits orthogonaly to this signal by application of dirty paper coding ( section [ sivd ] ) .",
    "each user chooses on its own to be served with or without bs cooperation .",
    "the decision is directed by a family of geometric policies , which depend on the ratio of the user distance to its first and second closest geographic bs neighbour and some design parameter @xmath2 , left as optimization variable ( section [ siv ] ) . in this way",
    "the plane is divided into non - overlapping zones of cooperation ( @xmath3 ) and no cooperation ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "an exact expression of the coverage probability in the network under study is derived ( section [ sv ] ) .",
    "numerical evaluation allows one to analyze coverage benefits compared to the non - cooperative case .",
    "these benefits are more important with dirty paper coding ( section [ svi ] ) .",
    "it is concluded ( section [ svii ] ) that cooperation can significantly improve coverage without exploitation of further network resources ( frequency , time , power ) , even with schemes of reduced channel state information .",
    "this work continues the line of research on applications of point processes to wireless networks and takes a step further to consider cooperative transmission in cellular networks . during the last years",
    "important results have been derived by use of stochastic geometry tools .",
    "the theoretical aspects of point processes and its applications in telecommunications can be found in the book of baccelli and baszczyszyn @xcite .",

    "heath @xcite have provided approximative performance evaluation when bss are randomly grouped into cooperative clusters . the transmission scheme they consider is intercell interference nulling .",
    "their approach differs from our work , because we consider optimal geographic association of each user with a pair of bss and coherent transmission ( after conferencing ) from the latter .",
    "all proofs of the analysis in this paper can be found in our extended version @xcite .",
