    "moreover , it has been shown recently that the angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) spectra from a quasi 2d material differ fundamentally from the three - dimensional ( 3d ) case due to the loss of @xmath0 selectivity@xcite .",

    "the framework of the standard dispersion relation , @xmath16 , is generalized to include an additional term @xmath17 .",
    "our focus is on the form of @xmath18 in lsco , ncco and bi2212 in terms of the effective intercell , interlayer hopping parameter @xmath5 and in the case of bi2212 the added intracell hopping @xmath9 , although forms in lsco and ncco involving additional intercell hopping terms are also presented .",
    "the values of various tb parameters are obtained via fits to the first principles local density approximation ( lda ) based band structures as well as to the experimental fermi surfaces ( fss ) and dispersions near the fermi energy ( @xmath19 ) in the optimally doped and overdoped systems .",

    "in developing model dispersions for various compounds within a one band ( single orbital on cu ) tb scheme , we begin by recalling that in general the three - dimensional energy bands for the tb hamiltonian can be expressed as ( assuming a lattice without a basis ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes a lattice vector and @xmath22 is the hopping parameter associated with the @xmath23 site . since our focus is on one - band models , we highlight the arrangement of the cu atoms within the cuo@xmath10 planes as well as between different cuo@xmath10 planes in fig .  1 , where various intraplane and interplane hoppings are identified .    in order to emphasize the effect of @xmath0-dispersion , we write @xmath24 here , @xmath25 and @xmath0 respectively denote the in - plane and out - of - plane components of @xmath26 .",

    "figure  [ fig:9 ] also compares the superconducting dome of bi2212 , with that of lsco@xcite , which is given by eq .",
    "[ eq:5 ] with @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 k. both formulas give an onset of superconductivity at @xmath154 , while the doping at optimal @xmath14 in bi2212 of @xmath149 is somewhat higher .",
    "honma , et al.@xcite have recently reported an even higher optimal doping for bi2212 , @xmath155 .",
    "the similarity with the uemura@xcite plot is striking , and may give insight into why the uemura plot peaks at different dopings for different cuprates@xcite .      whether the @xmath12-axis conductivity @xmath156 in the cuprates is coherent or not is currently a subject of considerable controversy .",
    "however , for a strongly correlated system , one would expect that increasing the interlayer hopping should increase @xmath156 , whether this conductivity is coherent or not .",
    "for instance , in a fluctuating stripe model , interlayer conductivity would be sensitive to whether charged stripes in different layers are in registry , but the actual hopping will be controlled by @xmath5 .",
    "also , in the interlayer pairing model , single particle interlayer hopping is frustrated by strong correlation effects , but the unfrustrated pair hopping still depends on the bare @xmath5 .",
    "our purpose here is only to ascertain whether our values of @xmath5 are consistent with the observed material variations of the @xmath12-axis conductivity in the cuprates .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "argues that @xmath156 at fixed doping should scale approximately as @xmath157 .",
    "figure  [ fig:7b ] shows that the plot of experimental@xcite @xmath156 vs @xmath157 is nearly linear@xcite , indicating that our @xmath5 values are at least not obviously inconsistent with experiment in lsco , ncco and bi2212 .",
    "note that we have taken the @xmath156 values in fig .",
    "[ fig:7b ] for the optimally doped samples where the @xmath12-axis conductivity is likely to be more coherent .",
    "van hove singularities in the electronic density of states ( dos ) have been implicated for playing an important role in determining various properties of the cuprates .",
    "if the interlayer coupling is neglected , i.e. the system is assumed to be strictly 2d , the vhs occurs as a sharp feature at a single energy in the dos of a monolayer system and at two different energies ( corresponding to the bilayer split bands ) in a double layer system .",
    "[ fig:15 ] shows this effect with the examples of lsco and bi2212 . here",
    "the horizontal axis is given in terms of the doping @xmath33 , which can be obtained straightforwardly for any given value of the fermi energy by counting the number of holes in the band , allowing the energy scale in the dos to be converted to the doping scale .",
    "the single sharp vhs peak for lsco in fig .",
    "[ fig:15](a ) at @xmath158 in the 2d case ( dashed line ) is replaced by a flat region of high dos spread over @xmath159 when the effect of @xmath0-dispersion is included ( solid line ) .",
    "a similar effect is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:15](b ) for bi2212 , except that here we have two peaks related to the bonding and antibonding bilayer bands .",
    "the antibonding vhs ( a , lower peak around @xmath160 ) displays a smaller width compared to the bonding vhs ( b , around @xmath161 ) , reflecting differences in the extent to which a and b bands are spread in energy through the coupling @xmath162 . by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig:15](b ) and  [ fig:9 ] , it can be seen that in bi2212 the optimal @xmath14 corresponds to a doping close to but less that the doping at which the antibonding vhs crosses the fermi level .",
    "the doping dependence of the positions of the vhss and their possible correlation with superconducting properties is briefly explored in fig .",
    "[ fig:16 ] . in order to help orient the reader , we consider fig .",
    "[ fig:16](a ) for lsco first . the thick solid curve ( upper boundary of the shaded region )",

    "the dashed thick curve similarly gives the binding energy of the trailing edge of the vhs .",
    "also shown are the gap parameter @xmath164 , defined via @xmath165 , for the superconducting dome ( dotted line ) and the value of the pseudogap from tunneling experiments@xcite ( triangles ) . in the same vein , fig .",
    "[ fig:16](b ) which refers to bi2212 , gives variations in the binding energies of the leading and trailing edges of the vhss for the bonding and antibonding bands , together with the gap parameter for the superconducting dome and various features in the tunneling and arpes spectra@xcite as detailed in the figure caption .",
    "[ fig:15](a ) shows that the effect of @xmath0-dispersion is quite substantial on lsco in that it spreads the vhs over a large portion of the superconducting dome . in bi2212 on the other hand",
    "the effect is smaller and the bonding and antibonding vhss remain distinct .",
    "one of the experimentally observed features in arpes and tunneling ( the lower binding energy datasets in fig .",
    "[ fig:16](b ) ) seems to track the antibonding vhs in bi2212 over a fairly large doping range , but this correlation for the higher binding energy feature is limited to optimal and overdoped regimes .",
    "in lsco , the tunneling feature shown correlates with the leading edge of the vhs and is well separated from the behavior of the trailing edge .",
    "however , the connection between the tunneling pseudogap ( which is approximately symmetrical about @xmath19 ) and the vhs ( which is not ) is nontrivial , and a more detailed analysis is considered beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we discuss tight - binding parameterization of electronic states near the fermi energy in lsco , ncco and bi2212 where the effect of @xmath0-dispersion is included in a comprehensive manner for the first time .",
    "our analysis proceeds within the framework of the one - band model and incorporates available arpes data and the results of first principles band structure computations on these cuprates .",
    "the in - plane coupling is treated in terms of the hoppings @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 between the nearest and farther out neighbors , while the coupling between different cuo@xmath10 layers is considered mainly through an effective intercell hopping @xmath5 , with an added hopping @xmath9 to account for the intracell interaction involving the cuo@xmath10 bilayer in bi2212 . in each compound",
    "we obtain the specific tight - binding form for describing the dispersion and the associated ` bare ' parameter sets , which fit the 3d band structures based on the lda , as well as ` dressed ' parameters which account for correlation effects beyond the lda on the experimental fss and near - fs dispersions in optimally doped and overdoped regimes .    in lsco ,",
    "the bare interlayer hopping @xmath166 ev is found to be a substantial fraction of the in - plane nn hopping @xmath1 with @xmath80 , and the size of @xmath5 is comparable to the values of in - plane second and higher neighbor terms . in ncco ,",
    "the interlayer coupling is anomalously small with @xmath99 , reflecting lack of apical o - atoms in the crystal structure ; we delineate how in this case other smaller terms become important and modify the @xmath0 dependence of the dispersion . in bi2212 , the bilayer coupling @xmath9 and the interlayer coupling @xmath5",
    "are both quite substantial , with @xmath108 and @xmath107 , as are the in - plane terms beyond the nn term ; a level degeneracy between the bonding and antibonding bands around @xmath167 induces an anomaly in @xmath0 dispersion .",
    "correlation effects beyond the lda reduce the band dispersions as expected , so that values of the dressed parameters are smaller than the corresponding bare values .",
    "renormalization factors for the hopping parameters vary substantially with average values of @xmath168 = 0.64 , 0.55 , and 0.28 in lsco , ncco and bi2212 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that any fitting procedure involving a limited basis set  a one band model here  possesses inherent uncertainty tied to the binding energy used in obtaining the fit . in the cuprates ,",
    "the present framework of the one band model would need to be modified when one moves to higher binding energies and bands derived from other cu @xmath169- and o @xmath170 -orbitals come into play .",
    "also , the experimental values of the interlayer couplings @xmath5 and @xmath9 adduced in this work should be viewed as upper bounds since these are based on model computations which only include the broadening effect of @xmath0-dispersion and do not take into account the effects of various scattering mechanisms and experimental resolution .",
    "our modeling of the @xmath0-dispersion effects provides insight into a number of issues of current interest and we briefly illustrate this aspect with three examples .",
    "( i ) we show that the inclusion of @xmath0-dispersion in modeling fs imprints yields doping levels @xmath33 for various published arpes datasets in bi2212 , which when plotted against related @xmath14 s , fall remarkably well on a parabola .",
    "this parametrization of the superconducting dome may help the determination of doping levels of bi2212 single crystals via arpes experiments more generally .",
    "( ii ) by using the values derived in this work , we show that the intercell hopping controlled by @xmath5 is consistent with @xmath12-axis transport , at least in optimally doped samples , with the @xmath12-axis conductivity @xmath156 scaling approximately as @xmath157 .",
    "( iii ) logarithmic van hove singularities ( vhss ) in the 2d case are spread over energy when @xmath0-dispersion is included .",
    "we compare the binding energies of the leading and trailing edges of the vhss with those of various prominent features observed in arpes and tunneling experiments in lsco and bi2212 .",
    "the antibonding vhs in bi2212 tracks some experimental features quite well over a wide doping range , but this is the case for the bonding vhs in bi2212 and the leading edge of the vhs in lsco mostly in the optimally doped regime .",
    "although specific implications of these results require further analysis , they suggest that attention should be given to the @xmath0 induced width of the vhss when making comparisons with experimental features .",
    "we conclude that the simple tight - binding parametrization of lsco , ncco and bi2212 presented in this article constitute a useful starting point for exploring the effects of @xmath0-dispersion on the electronic properties of the cuprates .",
