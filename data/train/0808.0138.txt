    "the failure of the supch models stems from the larger binding energy of a wd and the higher density .",

    "this comes from the larger @xmath15 and the larger @xmath106 in the supch2 model , as a result of the larger mass and binding energy of a wd ( i.e. , larger ratios of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , in which @xmath62 is reduced by the binding energy ) .",

    "an important quantity to characterize the relative line strengths is the ratio of density to heating rate per mass : generally , as this ratio increases , ionization ( competing with recombination ) and temperature ( competing with the line emission ) decrease , resulting in the stronger 7200    feature ( corresponding to the lower ionization state and temperature ) .",
    "more - massive models have the larger ratio ( e.g. , in supch2 the density is a factor of 2 , but the heating rate only a factor of 1.3 , larger than in model sw7 ) , but it is not sufficiently large to reproduce the observed , extremely large ratio of the red to the blue emission .",
    "we have presented late - time photometry and spectroscopy of sn 2006gz obtained with the subaru and keck i telescopes .",
    "these are the first late - time observational data for an sn ia that was claimed to be overluminous at early phases .",

    "this does not fit into the sequence of the late - time spectral behavior of normal sne ia , confirming that sn 2006gz belongs to a different subclass of objects than normal sne ia .",
    "coupled with this is the problem of the observed faintness of sn 2006gz , especially in the @xmath3 band .    the supch2 model ( with a 2  m@xmath0  wd progenitor synthesizing 1  m@xmath0of @xmath1ni ) is in good agreement with the early - phase bolometric light curve (  4.1 ; but see  5.1 ) , although it predicts a higher late - time luminosity than the ch - sn ia models because of the larger @xmath10 and @xmath66-ray deposition rate .",
    "the luminosity of sup - ch models exceeds that observed by more than 2 mag in the @xmath3 band .",
    "furthermore , one derives @xmath117  m@xmath0 , under the usual assumptions that the bulk of the deposited radioactive luminosity emerges at visual wavelengths , and that positrons are almost fully trapped within the ejecta . in what follows ,",
    "we list possible solutions for this inconsistency .",
    "we should first mention that the peak luminosity of sn 2006gz derived by hicken et al .",
    "( 2007 ) involves large uncertainty , as the host - galaxy extinction is not well constrained . if the host extinction is negligible , the peak luminosity of sn 2006gz is close to that of normal sne  ia ( @xmath118 mag ) . in this case , sn 2006gz might be a less energetic explosion of a ch - wd , possibly because of insufficient burning of the c - o layer to intermediate - mass elements , to be consistent with the observed slow light - curve evolution at early times .",
    "it is not clear if the early - phase spectroscopic features can be explained by this model : the early - phase spectra ( hicken et al . 2007 ) indicate that the photospheric temperature is high ( e.g. , the weak si ii 5972 ) and the velocity is normal ( @xmath11912,000 km s@xmath6 at @xmath16-band maximum ) .",
    "thus , the most straightforward interpretation is that the peak luminosity is also high .",

    "( 2007 ) , but the above caveat should be kept in mind . in the early and late - phases both become smaller . ]    from the late - time data , we find that @xmath120 is @xmath121 and @xmath122 mag larger ( that is , fainter ) than expected from the sw7 ( @xmath123  m@xmath0 ) and supch2 ( @xmath124  m@xmath0 ) models , respectively",

    "such a large discrepancy can not be attributed solely to the effect of viewing angle , even if sn 2006gz was a result of an extremely off - axis explosion ( see , e.g. , sim et al .",

    "if the early - phase emission is powered by @xmath127  m@xmath0  of @xmath1ni , then one is left with the possibility that some mechanism , which is not at work in normal sne  ia , must be affecting the late - time emission and the thermal conditions within the ejecta of sn 2006gz .",
    "one possibility is the escape of positrons produced by the @xmath1co decay out of the sn ejecta .",
    "the issue has been comprehensively explored by milne , the , & leising ( 2001 ) .",
    "they showed that a fraction of the positrons can escape for a radially combed and/or weak magnetic field , leading to the changing light curve at late times .",
    "however , at @xmath128 d , this effect can account for at most @xmath129 mag , which is not large enough to completely remedy the present problem .",
    "another possibility is the thermal catastrophe within the @xmath1ni - rich region , which shifts the bulk of the emission from optical to infrared wavelengths ( axelrod 1988 ) .",
    "this so - called `` infrared catastrophe '' ( irc ) is expected to take place after the temperature drops below a few 1000  k , depending on the electron density .",
    "observationally , the irc has not been clearly detected in any sne ia .",
    "the irc does not take place at @xmath130 yr in any of our models : the heating rate per unit volume in the fe - rich emission region is only a factor of @xmath131 smaller in supch2 than in sw7 , and thus the thermal conditions are similar in the two models .",
    "finally , it may be possible that the visual light from the @xmath1ni - rich region is converted to near - ir / mid - ir wavelengths by dust formed in the c+o - rich region . before maximum light",
    ", sn 2006gz showed the strongest c lines of any sn  ia ever observed , with little evolution in the absorption velocity .",
    "this indicates that a dense c+o - rich shell or clumps are present in sn 2006gz , at least in the outermost region . )",
    "degenerate c+o core ( with a central density as low as @xmath132 g @xmath56 ) surrounded by a spherical extended envelope .",
    "for such a configuration , they demonstrated that interaction between the ejecta and the hypothesized spherical envelope can give rise to a dense shell .",
    "however , the wd should evolve until the central density becomes sufficiently high ( @xmath133 g @xmath56 ) for explosive carbon burning to occur . at this point",
    ", the whole mass would be in an almost hydrostatic rotating wd ( uenishi , nomoto , & hachisu 2003 ; yoon & langer 2004 ) surrounded by a geometrically thin accretion disk . ]",
    "the presence of carbon may be a key to the understanding of the peculiar behavior at late phases , since carbon has a relatively high condensation temperature .",
    "the w7 model has @xmath134 @xmath56 at the inner edge of the c+o - rich region at 100  d after the explosion .",
    "the corresponding density in the supch models is a few times higher .",
    "recently , nozawa et al . (",
    "2008 ) theoretically investigated dust formation in sne  ib .",
    "they found a large amount of carbon grain formation in the c - enhanced outer he region , with a density comparable to that in the sn  ia models , in their model at @xmath135 d. thus , carbon grain formation in sne  ia may also be possible if carbon is abundant in the outermost region . for normal sne  ia , accelerated fading like that of sn 2006gz has never been reported .",
    "this may be consistent with the estimate that the upper limit of the carbon mass fraction is as low as 0.01 ( e.g. , tanaka et al . 2008 ) .",
    "details of the dust formation process , addressing the difference between sn ib and sn ia models ( heating rate by @xmath1ni , different oxygen mass fraction , etc . ) , should be investigated , as well as details of expected observational signatures during the dust formation . in this interpretation , a part of the outer ca - rich region might be mixed with the c+o - rich region .",
    "it may partly explain the relative strength of the feature at @xmath136    relative to the [ fe  ii ] and [ fe  iii ] in the blue , since [ ca  ii ] arising from the ca - rich region could be less diluted than the fe emission , contributing to the 7300    feature .",
    "the possible interpretations we listed above are only speculative , but they predict distinct observational signatures , to be tested in future overluminous sne  ia .",
    "first , late - time spectroscopy of other potentially overluminous sne  ia would be extremely useful to see whether sn 2006gz is special even among these peculiar sne  ia .",
    "if some of them show the sn 2006gz - like peculiarities at late phases , the optical light curves spanning from early to late times should provide a probe : ( a ) the irc and dust scenarios predict a sudden decrease in the visual luminosity , ( b ) the positron - escape scenario would manifest itself with a relatively gentle decrease of the luminosity , and ( c ) other heating scenarios would not necessarily follow the quasi - exponential decline .    near - ir light curves could directly show the effects of the irc and dust distinctly from other scenarios : we expect that a rapid increase in the near - ir brightness should occur simultaneously with a rapid decrease in the visual brightness , while other scenarios do not necessarily predict this behavior",
    ".    a temporal sequence of optical spectra would also be highly useful . in the dust formation scenario",
    ", we may see a transient red continuum and emission - line shifts at intermediate phases , as was seen in the peculiar sn ib 2006jc ( smith , foley , & filippenko 2008 ) .",
    "finally , the irc and dust scenarios could be unambiguously distinguished with near - ir through mid - ir spectra .",
    "blackbody radiation from the dust particles should be seen in the dust scenario , while line emission is the dominant cooling process in the irc scenario .",
    "we thank the director of subaru , masahiko hayashi , as well as hiroshi terada , for kindly allowing us to exchange observing time and targets in the subaru proposal s07b-057 ( pi : k.m . ) , making the sn 2006gz observations possible .",
