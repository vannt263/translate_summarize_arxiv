    "a realistic physical system inevitably interacts with the surrounding environment , leading to lose information from the system to the environment .",

    "if the environment only feeds back the information in the infinite time , it means that the whole dynamics is markovian .",
    "the dynamical process of markovianity can also be treated as a limiting approximation of non - markovianity@xcite .",
    "it is highly interesting to explore the non - markovian effects , because there are many systems suffering from the strong back - action from environment@xcite .",
    "hence , the non - markovianity plays an important role in many respects . up to now , there are a lot of works about it .",
    "non - markovianity can assist the formation of steady state entanglement@xcite ; non - markovian coherent feedback control can also suppress the decoherence@xcite ; and non - markovian effects are considered in a new theory of polymer reaction kinetics so that the dynamics of polymers can be controlled@xcite .",
    "the direct observation of non - markovian radiation dynamics has been completed in @xmath0 dimension bulk photonic crystals@xcite ; and the observation of non - markovian dynamics of a single quantum dot has also been completed in a micropillar cavity@xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that the authors , in the ref.@xcite , find a new resource for quantum memory effects by the nonlocal non - markovianity , where they utilize the quantum correlations between two environments and control the local interaction time to turn a markovian to a non - markovian regime .",
    "it will become more and more interesting in the further research about the nonlocal non - markovian effects , such as how to enhance and control the nonlocal non - markovian effects .    in this article , we further discuss the nonlocal non - markovian effects when the local dynamics are non - markovian - non - markovian , markovian - non - markovian or markovian - markovian .",
    "then , we find that without extra control the nonlocal non - markovian effects ca nt appear under the condition of markovian - markovian .",
    "besides taking control on the interaction time in the ref.@xcite , we find that reducing the strength of interaction also turn a markovian to a non - markovian regime . in surprise , increasing the strength of interaction can also do it .",
    "both of two examples in the ref.@xcite they consider that the initial correlations of two environments are nonlocal(having quantum correlations ) .",
    "we find that the classical correlations can perform as well as the quantum correlations . in many real situations ,",
    "the classical correlations between two environments are easier to be formed compared to the quantum correlations .",
    "and we advise two special ways to form the classical correlations , leading to the nonlocal non - markovian effects .",

    "we get the numerical solution and obtain that the self - correlation of each environment helps the nonlocal non - markovian effects .",
    "we consider that the initial state of two subsystems is a pure state given by @xmath1 under the local interactions with environments @xmath2 and @xmath3 , a dephasing map for two qubits of of general form@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 for @xmath6 , 2 , and 12 ; @xmath7 .",

    "so if @xmath15 and @xmath11 decrease , meanwhile , @xmath13 or @xmath14 increases , it is possible that the local systems lose information by the dephasing , but at the same time the global system increases the information .",
    "here we use the measure for non - markovianity of the dephasing process @xmath16",

    "the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath76 where the first term on the right hand side is the interaction hamiltonian between the system and the environments ; the second term is the interaction hamiltonian between the entanglement system(another system which is initially in the bell state and @xmath77 is the pauli operator of corresponding subsystem @xmath45 ) and the same environments ; the function @xmath78 for @xmath79 and zero otherwise ; @xmath80 for @xmath81 and zero otherwise . here ,",

    "then , using weak coupling approximation @xmath89\\approx0 $ ] , and performing continuum limit with ohmic spectrum density @xmath90@xcite ( @xmath91 is coupling constant and @xmath92 is frequency cutoff ) , we get @xmath93|,\\nonumber\\\\ & |\\lambda_{12}|=|\\exp(-\\gamma_1-\\gamma_2)\\cos[\\sum_{i=1}^2\\int dwa_i\\exp(-w/\\omega_i)\\xi_i]|,\\nonumber\\\\ & \\textmd{in which},\\nonumber\\\\ & \\xi_i=2\\sin [ w(t_i(t)-t'_i(t))]-2\\sin [ w t_i(t)]+2\\sin [ w t'_i(t ) ] , \\nonumber\\\\ & \\gamma_i=\\int dwa_i\\exp(-w/\\omega_i)\\coth(2w/\\beta)(1-\\cos[w t_i(t)],\\nonumber\\\\ & \\alpha_k = g_k\\frac{1-\\exp(iw_kt)}{w_k}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as shown in fig.6 , the information begins to flow back to the global system when @xmath50 begins to increase , meaning that the correlations between the two environments is formed to make the nonlocal non - markovian effects emerge . and",
    "we find the bell state have the same function as the classical state @xmath94 on forming the classical correlations of two environments , so it has the robustness against some noise .",
    "if one want to form stronger correlations , it just need to increase the number of bell state .    from the eq.([eqn14 ] ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 change with time @xmath23 . here",
    ", the parameter @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . ]    then , the second way is that after two subsystems interact locally with the corresponding two environments without the initial correlations for some time , exchanging the locations of two subsystems generate that they interact locally with each other initial environment .",
    "similar calculation as the above way which is immune to data , it is easy to observe the nonlocal non - markovian effects .",
    "the reason is that the system loses information , leading to the correlations between two environments . and",
    "it is necessary to exchange the locations of two subsystems because if do nt exchange the locations , the correlations between the system and the two environments will keep the system losing information , never lead to the appearance of nonlocal non - markovian effects .",
    "the benefit of this way is that it do nt need other correlational states to form the correlations between two environments .",
    "obviously , it ca nt form very strong correlations like the first way .",

    "in this section , we explore whether the self - correlation of two environments promotes the nonlocal non - markovian effects .",

    "in this article we explore that a quantum system composed of two subsystems locally interacts with two environments in detail .",
    "we obtain that the function of correlations of two environments has an upper bound : only make a flow of information from the environment back to the global system start finitely earlier than that back to any one of two local systems , not finitely(when the whole hamiltonian of system and two environments is dependent of time ) .",
    "it means that nonlocal non - markovian effects ca nt appear when both of two local dynamics are markovian .",
    "of course , extra control can turn a markovian to a non - markovian regime . besides the control of local interaction time , reducing the coupling strength of local interaction(representing that reduce the rate of losing information of subsystems ) can make the nonlocal non - markovian effects appear .",
    "surprisingly , enhancing the the couping strength of local interaction ( increase the rate of losing information of subsystems ) can also make it .",
    "and we advise two ways which is easy in the experiment to form the classical correlations between two environments without initial correlations .",
    "finally , we obtain that the self - correlation of two environments can promote the nonlocal non - markovian effects .",
    "recently , the ref.@xcite accessed the non - markovianity based on ideas of divisibilities of channels ; the ref.@xcite proposed a way to quantify the memory effects in the spin - boson model ; the ref.@xcite advised two different approaches to quantify non - markovianity ; and the ref.@xcite quantified non - markovianity via correlations .",
    "it is also very interesting to quantify the nonlocal non - markovianity in different ways , for a better understanding and characterization of nonlocal non - markovian effects in more complex systems .",
    "the nonlocal non - markovian effects means the nonlocal memory of global environments , which may be used to perform some quantum information process , such as quantum memory@xcite and quantum error correction@xcite . and this article will be meaningful for how to utilize and control the nonlocal non - markovian effects by controlling the local dynamics in the future works .",
