    "a powerful technique for investigating electromagnetic ( em ) field distribution around nanostructures is provided by very fast ( relativistic ) electron beams ( e - beams ) , with typical lateral resolution on an atomic scale , available in scanning transmission electron microscopes ( stem)batson83,howie85,muller93,cohen98,lembrikov03,cohen03 . as discussed previously , when the e - beam is restricted to the vacuum near a selected nanoparticle@xcite ,",
    "its em interaction with surface plasmons or surface plasmon - polaritons ( spps ) @xcite is reminiscent of the near - field interaction@xcite of subwavelength optical probes .",
    "several works have recently studied realizations of cherenkov radiation excitation within various dielectric media by e - beams moving in near - field vacuum zones zabala03,deabajo98 - 99,ochiai04,deabajo03 . in all",
    "the latter works the energy loss processes were described within a simple classical model in which the fast electron was assumed to move with a constant velocity along a straight line trajectory near a finite dielectric medium such that the energy loss intensity could be obtained from the force exerted on the electron due to its self - induced electric field through the nearby dielectric medium .",
    "the great simplification achieved by this approach amounts to reducing the full scattering problem at hand to a problem of finding the em field induced by the e - beam in the vacuum around the dielectric medium .",
    "the resulting em field could include cherenkov - like radiative components around the e - beam which were restricted , however , to propagation within the interior of the dielectric medium .",
    "in this paper we present a quantum mechanical theory for the inelastic scattering of a relativistic highly focused e - beam traveling near nanoparticles in a ` non - touching ' aloof configuration@xcite .",
    "we show that the electron wave scattering by nanoparticle edges along the beam axis switches on cherenkov - like radiation channels which extend into the vacuum away from the nanoparticle . the resulting far - field coupling between the electron and the nanoparticle is found to dramatically enhance various radiative channels in the loss spectrum .    to illustrate our main points we consider here a simple model ( see fig.1 ) where the e - beam is propagated in the vacuum along a wide face of a rectangular nanoplatelet ( oriented , e.g. , in the @xmath1 plane ) , and a surface or guided wave induced by the electron is propagated with a wave number @xmath2 along the beam axis",
    ". the spatially sensitive nature of the corresponding electron energy loss process arises from the exponential dependence , @xmath3 , of the em interaction between the e - beam and the platelet on the impact parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the extinction coefficient , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , determines the tail of the evanescent field in the vacuum for values of @xmath7  outside the light - cone , i.e. for @xmath8 . inside the light - cone , i.e. for @xmath9 , @xmath10 is purely imaginary and the corresponding interaction becomes spatially oscillating , allowing the electron to exchange photons with the particle far away into the vacuum .",
    "this striking mechanism has been overlooked in the recent literature of stem - electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) , since the excitation by an electron moving in the vacuum with a classical velocity @xmath11 , has been restricted to a constant longitudinal wavenumber @xmath12 , implying em coupling to the nanoparticle which is restricted to the evanescent tail near the surface .",
    "our model calculation is applied to two types of nanoscopic platelets , conducting platelets made of silver or gold , and dielectric platelets made of insulators such as silica or magnesia .  for both types of nanoparticles",
    "we find significant loss signals in the low energy range of the spectrum , where the electron - hole excitation probability is either zero ( for the insulator ) or very small ( for the metals ) , exhibiting far - field ( radiative ) characteristics .",
    "in particular , specific spp modes of the silver platelet , which penetrate into the light cone , can be excited by the external e - beam , leading to new features in the eel spectrum which decay weakly with the beam - platelet distance .",
    "following ref.@xcite , the focused e - beam is described here as a one - dimensional wave , propagating along the @xmath13-axis , while in the transverse ( @xmath14 ) directions it is described by a wave - packet localized within a smoothly converging cross section along the beam axis , whose shape is assumed to be squared for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the corresponding green s function for the noninteracting focused e - beam may be therefore written in the general form : @xmath15where @xmath16 is the longitudinal ( along the beam axis ) electron momentum , @xmath17 its total relativistic energy eigenvalue , with @xmath18 the electron rest mass ,  @xmath19 @xmath20(@xmath21 ) its transverse momentum , and @xmath22 the corresponding e - beam eigenfunction ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the electromagnetic ( em ) interaction between the e - beam and the platelet may be described effectively by the hamiltonian :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the scalar and @xmath13-component of the em four - vector potential respectively , @xmath26 is the electron position vector , @xmath27 is a collective symbol for the position vectors of the platelet charges , and @xmath28 the dynamic electron mass .    to first order of the perturbation theory with respect to the em interaction hamiltonian , @xmath29 , the probability for the e - beam to go , during the time interval @xmath30 , from initial to final eigen states when the platelet initial state is the ground state is :    @xmath31    where the the sum is over the platelet final states @xmath32 , and : @xmath33 -1}{\\left [ i\\left ( \\varepsilon -\\varepsilon ^{\\prime } \\right ) /\\hbar % \\right ] } $ ]  .  in the limit",

    "the resulting expression reduces ( see appendix b ) to the surface dielectric response function obtained in ref.@xcite by using maxwell s equations with macroscopic boundary conditions .",
    "the standard classical approximation for the loss function @xcite is obtained from eq.([rateprobab ] ) by making the following assumptions : ( 1 ) the e - beam transverse momentum distribution function @xmath90 is a constant , that is equivalent to a @xmath91-function in the corresponding real - space transverse coordinates , ( 2 ) the contribution of the transverse energy to the longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath92 ( see eq.([deltaq_x ] ) ) can be neglected , and ( 3 ) the effective particle size , @xmath93 , appearing as an integration limit along the beam axis , is infinite .",
    "assumption ( 3 ) , in conjunction with ( 1 ) , yields the conservation of longitudinal momentum , i.e. @xmath94 , which together with assumption ( 2 ) imposes the fixed condition @xmath95 .",

    "recoil is only a classical remnant of the present effect and of less general appearance . in particular",
    ", it vanishes for large media , such as the porous film investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , for which ( if made sufficiently thin ) the quantum mechanical momentum uncertainty along the e - beam axis remains significant .",
    "it should be stressed that , for the sake of simplicity , the platelet dielectric response is calculated by assuming its wide faces to be infinite .",
    "a fully consistent treatment of the breakdown of translation invariance is expected , however , to further enhance all radiative channels .",
    "the calculation of the kinematical factor @xmath112 , responsible for the longitudinal momentum uncertainty in our model , from the integral in eq.([kinematical ] ) , could generate artificial oscillations by the sharp cutoff of the integral at @xmath113 .",
    "to avoid such oscillations we use an equivalent gaussian distribution function in our actual calculations .",
    "the corresponding smooth cutoff is , in fact , more realistic than that appearing in eq.(kinematical ) since it arises from the attenuation of the e - beam - platelet interaction at @xmath114 values larger than @xmath55 . in any event ,",
    "the exact form of the corresponding distribution function is of no great importance for the main purpose of our present paper .",
    "as a first example we calculate the eel function of a @xmath115 nm long silver and gold platelets for an external @xmath115 kev e - beam at various impact parameters ( see figs.2 and 3 ) . to analyze the various spp resonances one may consider the zeros of the denominator of the extraordinary wave amplitude @xmath116 in eq.([dielectresponse ] ) in the complex @xmath117-plane",
    ". with the experimental optical dielectric function , @xmath118 , for silver @xcite the resulting dispersion relation ( inset , fig.(2 ) ) exhibits a rather flat branch of @xmath119 inside the light - cone , which can be attributed to radiative spp , seen as a mirror image of the usual non - radiative sp dispersion curve with respect to the light - line .",
    "the sector of @xmath119 connecting the two branches across the light line has a vanishing negative slope , where @xmath120 has a sharp peak .",
    "the sharp dip in the eel spectrum just above the classical sp frequency ( at @xmath121 ev ) reflects these closely related features .    at slightly higher frequencies the eel signals",
    "exhibit a pronounced rise due to the enhanced spp density of states associated with the flat radiative spp branch .",
    "these peculiar features are missing in the loss spectra of the gold platelet , shown in fig.3 .",
    "the eel intensity in this spectral region exhibits attenuation with increasing impact parameter significantly weaker than the corresponding attenuation of the main sp peak calculated in the classical limit .",
    "the radiative nature of the beam - particle coupling shown in figs.(2,3 ) is even more pronounced in the low energy region below the main sp peak , where the classically calculated signal drops to very small values . here",
    "our calculated eel function exhibits a pronounced broad band with linearly increasing intensity for increasing frequency and almost no attenuation with increasing impact parameter .",
    "these features are due to the fact that the loss signal well below the main sp frequency is dominated by the contribution from the ordinary wave amplitude @xmath122 , appearing in eq.([dielectresponse ] ) , which is singularly enhanced near the light line ( where @xmath123 ) , and thus reflecting the nearly pure ( transverse ) photonic nature of the excitations by the e - beam in this classically forbidden region .",
    "the results of our calculations may be compared to the experimental data reported in ref.@xcite for silver and gold nano rods and ellipsoids .",
    "fig.4 shows our calculated eel spectra for three silver platelets with @xmath124 nm and @xmath125 nm at impact parameter @xmath126 nm .",
    "the shown curves may be compared to the spectrum in ref.@xcite obtained for a silver ellipsoid with a long half - axis _ _  _ _ ( @xmath127  nm ) and two short half - axes ( @xmath128  nm ) _ _  _ _ at impact parameter @xmath129 nm above the ellipsoid wide face .",
    "the two lower curves , particularly those corresponding to @xmath130 nm , exhibit good agreement with the relevant experimental data .",
    "specifically , in addition to the very good agreement of the calculated main plasmon peak position ( @xmath131 ev ) with the experimental one , the intensities ratio ( @xmath132 ) between the main plasmon peak and the high energy broad peak , and the extent and magnitude of the low energy tail shown in fig.4 , are seen to agree pretty well with the corresponding experimental results .",
    "in contrast a large intensities ratio ( @xmath133 ) and a very small low energy tail characterize the classical curve shown in fig.4 , both indicating the importance of the quantum effects predicted by our theory .",
    "note that an important feature of our calculated spectra , the large dip just above the main plasmon peak , which is missing in the experimental data , is shown to develop only at relatively large values of @xmath93 ( i.e. for @xmath134 nm ) .",
    "the situation in the forbidden energy gap region of semiconductors and insulators is in a sense an extreme case of the effect demonstrated in the low energy region of fig.2 : the eel spectra shown in fig.5 are calculated for an external @xmath115 kev e - beam , propagating parallel to the @xmath1 face of a @xmath115 nm long sio@xmath0 platelet with half thickness @xmath135  nm , at different impact parameters @xmath4 .",
    "the spectra reveal a pronounced double - peak structure within the forbidden gap region , which does not decay with increasing @xmath4 values . strictly speaking",
    ", this structure reduces to a single broad peak for platelets of widths @xmath136  nm , reflecting a finite - size effect . similarly to the situation with the silver and gold platelets well below the main sp peak , the strong radiative nature of this feature arises from the ordinary wave amplitude @xmath137 , corresponding to the excitation of purely transverse em waves , polarized within the @xmath1 plane , which totally dominates the loss signal in the forbidden gap region .",
    "the spectra shown in fig.5 may be compared to the results reported in ref.@xcite for an electron moving parallel to a @xmath138 sio@xmath0 wedge at a distance of @xmath139 nm ( see fig.(1 ) ) .",
    "the pronounced radiative broad band within the gap region , obtained in our calculation , dramatically contrasts the vanishing loss signal shown there in _ _  _ _ fig.(4 ) for an electron beam with the same velocity ( @xmath140 ) and nearly the same impact parameter .",
    "the lack of far - field coupling in the latter theoretical approach restricted the fast external e - beam to excitation of em waves confined within the dielectric medium @xcite , similar to ordinary waveguide modes which can develop within a thin sio@xmath0 slab in the forbidden gap region where @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "for an ideal planar geometry ( as assumed in our calculation of the dielectric response function @xmath143 ) , the corresponding waveguide modes appear as extremely narrow resonances which can not be excited by an e - beam with @xmath92 values outside the light cone due to the vanishingly small dielectric damping , @xmath144 .",
    "such radiation excitations become possible for the nonplanar geometries studied in refs.@xcite,@xcite even under the rigid e - beam trajectory approximation exploited there ( but only above a threshold beam energy considerably higher than @xmath115 kev ) due to the translational symmetry - broken dielectric media considered in their calculations . yet , the corresponding cherenkov - like channels remain fundamentally different from the ones we propose :  the opening of scattering channels with wave numbers inside the light cone allows coupling of the e - beam to the _ continuum _ of em modes which are extended into the vacuum perpendicular to the platelet wide face .",
    "the relative strength of the present radiative mechanism may be further appreciated by noting the calculated spectra near a sharp sio@xmath0 wedge in ref.@xcite , where in spite of the geometrical enhancement of near - field cherenkov coupling , beam energies far above @xmath115 kev were needed there for ` switching on ' such channels .    finally , it is instructive to compare our predicted loss spectrum of an external @xmath115 kev e - beam propagating above a mgo platelet with half - sides @xmath145 nm at an impact parameter @xmath146 nm ( see fig.6 ) to the experimental data reported in ref.@xcite for a mgo smoke cube of @xmath115 nm size .",
    "the overall agreement is good , including the occurrence , in both the calculated spectrum and the experimental data , of a broad , nonvanishing signal within the forbidden gap region , which is missing in the classically calculated spectrum . in this gap region",
    "the    calculated spectrum exhibits a smooth oscillatory structure associated with the multiple reflection of the generated radiation between the two parallel faces of the platelet perpendicular to the z - axis .",
    "this finite - size effect is peculiar to the far - field radiative modes found in the present paper for platelets confined in the direction along the e - beam axis , _ _  _ _ and is different from ( though related to ) the extremely sharp resonances associated with the waveguide modes developed in an ideal ( i.e. wide laterally ) planar dielectric thin film .",
    "thus , the classical approach applied to such an ideal film yields usually ( i.e. except for extremely rare coincidences of the loss energy with the resonant frequencies ) null loss intensity , whereas in _ _  _ _ our quantum calculations the continuous window of wavenumbers inside the light - cone removes the stringent resonant conditions and allows the appearance of a significant loss intensity in the entire gap region .",
    "it is interesting to note that the average calculated signal inside the gap region increases smoothly with increasing frequency from zero up to nearly the interband threshold where its intensity relative to the loss main peaks ( at @xmath147 @xmath148 and @xmath149 ev ) is about @xmath150 .",
    "this ratio is remarkably close to the corresponding relative intensity observed experimentally in ref.@xcite .",
    "applying a quantum - mechanical approach to the scattering problem of highly focused relativistic e - beams near nanoplatelets , we have shown that cherenkov - like radiation of stem e - beams , discussed recently in the literature @xcite , has a much broader scope than originally presented .",
    "dramatic enhancements of radiative channels arise from the breakdown of momentum conservation along the e - beam axis in the inelastic process due to scattering of the electron wave by the nanoparticle edges .",
    "further enhancements , realized due to the extreme lateral confinement of the e - beam and its associated transverse momentum uncertaintycohen98 , have not been considered in detail here .",
    "the radiation predicted to be emitted from both conducting and insulating nanoplatelets can be generated at impact parameters larger than the evanescent tail of the excited surface em modes due to the oscillatory distance dependence of the electron - platelet interaction for momentum transfers within the light - cone .",
    "consequently , this radiation should have a significant propagation component perpendicular to its main direction along the e - beam axis .",
    "large deviations from the classical eel signal are found to persist also at small impact parameters , which can be readily tested experimentally .",
    "the results of our calculations for silver platelets seem to agree pretty well with the experimental data reported in ref.@xcite for silver nano ellipsoids . furthermore , experimental observation of loss signals within the forbidden energy gap of mgo cubes of @xmath115 nm size by aizpurua et al .",
    "aizpurua97 seems as well to support our main prediction .",
    "in this appendix we specialize our general model of the focused e - beam to allow a more detailed discussion of some aspects of eels experiments in stem pertinent to the subject under study in this paper .",
    "we employ the relativistic schrodinger s wave equation :    @xmath151 \\psi \\left ( x , y , z\\right ) & = & \\widetilde{\\varepsilon } ^{2}\\psi \\left ( x , y , z\\right )   \\text { , } \\\\",
