    "consistent calculations of nuclear partition functions and level densities are required in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "the nuclear partition functions at a finite temperature are needed to understand pre - supernova collapse @xcite and for the calculation of stellar thermal reaction rates @xcite .",
    "similarly , level densities determine the statistical neutron and proton capture cross - sections in nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the fermi gas formula ( also known as the bethe formula ) @xcite for the nuclear level density can be derived from the partition function of non - interacting nucleons @xcite .",
    "correlation effects , e.g. , shell , pairing and deformation effects , are usually accounted for through empirical modifications of this formula . in particular ,",
    "the back - shifted bethe formula @xcite is found to describe well the experimental data if its parameters , the single - particle level density parameter @xmath2 and back - shift parameter @xmath3 , are fitted for each nucleus @xcite . however , these phenomenological approaches can not be reliably used in nuclei for which experimental data are not available , so there is a need for microscopic theories that include interaction effects . in mean field theory , pairing can be treated in the bcs approximation , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , shape fluctuations are likely to be significant and they require a theory beyond the mean field , e.g. , the static path approximation @xcite . a theory that includes quadrupole fluctuations in the static path approximation",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . like the mean field theory",
    ", the static path approximation allows calculations in large spaces .",
    "this was exploited by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite who presented results for large single - particle spaces including an approximate treatment of unbound states . however , as implemented there , the theory includes neither pairing correlations , which are certainly of similar importance , nor multipoles of the interaction beyond quadrupole .",
    "a more systematic approach to calculate correlation effects is to use the interacting shell model . in this approach",
    ", we define a many - particle configuration space and treat in full the effective interaction within that space . here",
    "the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) method has rather favorable computational properties , scaling with the number @xmath4 of single - particle orbitals as @xmath5 , compared to direct diagonalization methods , which scale exponentially .",
    "even so , most applications of the smmc have so far been limited to a single major shell . for medium mass nuclei , this restricts the reliability of the calculated partition functions ( and associated level densities ) to temperatures below @xmath6 mev @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will first explore the model space truncations in an independent - particle approximation , extending the single - particle space to include both the bound states and the continuum .",
    "this was studied within a semiclassical approximation in ref .",
    "we will develop the fully quantum - mechanical theory that includes the continuum is slightly larger than the size of the nucleus . our treatment is exact and corresponds to the limit @xmath7 . ] in section  [ sec : independent ] .",
    "we find that in tightly bound nuclei , the continuum contribution is negligible even at high temperatures ( e.g. , @xmath8 mev for @xmath9fe ) , while in weakly bound nuclei the continuum contribution can become significant already at low temperatures . in either case",
    "the continuum contribution can be well approximated by considering just the contribution of the narrow resonances , treated as broadened bound states .",
    "the remaining task is to include interaction effects , as discussed in section [ sec : interaction ] .",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between the long - range part of the interaction , acting in the valence orbitals , and the short - range part , involving highly excited configurations .",
    "the short - range part is beyond the scope of the theory , and must be taken into account in defining an effective long - range interaction , but the latter can be accurately treated within the smmc approach . at higher temperatures , long - range interaction effects are weak and corrections to the entropy from the larger model space can be included in a single - particle approach .",
    "we shall see that at high temperatures , the interaction effects on the partition function scale as @xmath10 , and the two temperature regimes can be joined smoothly .",
    "we find that the extended partition function and its associated level density are well described by the back - shifted bethe formula up to @xmath8 mev .",
    "this value represents an upper limit for our underlying assumption that the single - particle potential is fixed and independent of temperature .",

    ". we shall find it convenient to measure the energy with respect to the ground energy @xmath14 , defining an excitation partition function @xmath15 as @xmath16 thus at zero temperature , the excitation partition function is equal to the degeneracy of the ground state @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the conversion from the partition function to the level density is discussed in section [ sec : level - density ] .",
    "while the results of the theory can be given as numerical tables of @xmath19 and the corresponding level density @xmath20 , it is also useful to express the results in terms of the parameters of the back - shifted bethe formula , which provides a good description at not too low temperatures .",
    "the inclusion of a back shift requires a particular parameterization of @xmath15 , as discussed in section [ sec : interaction ] .",
    "when the temperature is larger than about a third of the nucleon separation energy , the unbound nucleon states can no longer be ignored . to develop a theory that includes the continuum , we first need to define precisely how we separate the contributions of the free nucleons and the nucleus to the partition function .",
    "if the system is enclosed in a box , the free nucleon partition function is proportional to the volume of this box .",
    "the contribution of the continuum to the nuclear partition function is found by the explicit subtraction of the free - particle contribution , and is independent of the volume of the box , if it is large compared to the size of the nucleus .",

    "furthermore , the specific values of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 found in previous smmc calculations  @xcite are approximately valid in this extended energy range .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the level density of the odd-@xmath160 nucleus @xmath123fe , where we find in the extended range @xmath161 mev@xmath106 and @xmath162 mev .",
    "these values are comparable to the values determined from @xmath99 in section [ sec : interaction ] .",
    "the good fits we find to the back - shifted formulas ( [ bbf - partition ] ) and ( [ bbf ] ) , for the logarithm of the partition function and the level density , respectively , imply that the excitation energy can be approximated by the quadratic expression ( [ quadratic ] ) for not too low temperatures .",
    "experimentally , the statistical properties of nuclei at higher temperatures have been deduced from heavy ion reactions .",
    "if the nuclei are equilibrated when they decay , there is a direct relation between the kinetic energy distributions of the decay products and the temperature of the daughter nucleus .",
    "experimental results have been reported indicating that the quadratic dependence of @xmath157 on temperature needed to be modified at high temperature  @xcite .",
    "however in other experiments only a slight deviation was found  @xcite .",
    "these latter experiments concluded a weak decrease of @xmath2 with temperature and even a constant @xmath2 could not be excluded , in agreement with our results .",
    "the back - shifted parameterization works well for temperatures @xmath74 mev , but not at lower temperatures .",
    "the deviations can be clearly seen in the canonical heat capacity as a function of the temperature",
    ". there can be a peak in this function that is associated with the pairing phase transition , but the back - shifted parameterization permits only a monotonic function rising linearly with temperature .",
    "recently , experiments in rare - earth nuclei have been reported in which effects of pair breaking can be seen in the canonical heat capacity  @xcite .",
    "the authors measured the level density , constructed a canonical partition function from their data , and used it to deduce the heat capacity as a function of temperature .",
    "such low temperature characteristics , especially those requiring numerical derivatives , are nontrivial to calculate in the smmc , but in ref .",
    "@xcite a method was found to accurately calculate the heat capacity in the temperature range of interest .",
    "a slight enhancement over the fermi gas heat capacity was found in even iron nuclei around @xmath163 mev .",
    "this enhancement is more pronounced for the neutron - rich iron isotopes and is correlated with the reduction in the number of @xmath164 neutron pairs with temperature . however , because the calculation was restricted to a finite space ( @xmath71 shell ) , the calculated heat capacity reached a maximum around temperatures of @xmath73 mev and the effect of the pairing phase transition was less pronounced .",
    "here we use the extended theory to display the heat capacity in a much broader temperature range ( i.e. , up to @xmath165 mev ) , where deviations from the basic linear dependence become obvious .",
    "the effect of the pairing transition on the heat capacity is now clearly observed even in the iron isotopes with a smaller number of neutrons in which the effect was not noticeable before , e.g. , @xmath9fe .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the extended heat capacity of @xmath9fe calculated from ( [ s - c ] ) and ( [ c - sp ] ) ( solid squares ) in comparison with the independent - particle heat capacity calculated in the full space ( solid line ) .",
    "contrary to the smmc heat capacity , the extended heat capacity continued to increase monotonically with temperature as does @xmath166 .",
    "however , it also exhibits a ` shoulder ' at low temperatures that is a clear signature of the pairing phase transition and is qualitatively similar to the measured heat capacity in even - even rare - earth nuclei  @xcite .",
    "in this work we have combined the partition function of the independent - particle model in the full space with the partition function of the interacting shell model calculated in a small space by the smmc method .",
    "this enables us to extend the smmc calculations of partition functions and level densities up to significantly higher temperatures .",
    "the results for iron nuclei suggest that the back - shifted bethe formula ( [ bbf ] ) ( with temperature - independent parameters ) is valid over a wide range of temperatures extending from @xmath110 mev to @xmath8 mev .",
    "the two parameters of the formula , the single - particle level density parameter @xmath2 and the back shift @xmath3 , agree well with the empirical values .",
    "a corresponding empirical formula ( [ bbf - partition ] ) that accommodates correlation effects describes well the logarithm of the excitation partition function .",
    "expressed in the form @xmath167 , the theoretical value for @xmath9fe is @xmath108 mev .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the fermi - gas value of @xmath168 mev .",
    "it is also smaller than the value @xmath169 mev extracted from the high temperature slope of the logarithm of the independent - particle partition function , indicating the importance of correlation effects . in the literature , effective values of the parameter @xmath2",
    "are often defined from relations that are valid in the fermi gas limit ( and that ignore corrections due to particle - number fluctuations ) ; e.g. , @xmath149 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 . in the presence of shell and correlation effects ,",
    "these effective values of @xmath2 usually differ from each other and exhibit a temperature dependence even at lower temperatures . using the empirical relation ( [ bbf - partition ] ) for the partition function , we find a constant value of @xmath2 that is similar to the value extracted from the level density itself .",
    "the effects of interactions and unbound states were also taken into account in ref .",
    "the authors parameterized their results with a temperature - dependent @xmath115 , and found it to vary significantly , unlike our @xmath115 .",
    "however , their work only included part of the interaction , omitting in particular the pairing interaction ( which is largely responsible for the back shift ) , and their treatment of the continuum was approximate .",
    "the variation they observe at low temperatures @xmath172 mev is at least partly due to definitions of @xmath115 that are based on the fermi gas limit .    for temperatures below @xmath173 mev ,",
    "the pairing effects are strong and beyond the range of applicability of simple parameterizations .",
    "this can be seen in the canonical heat capacity if it is displayed over a large temperature range , as we did using our extended theory .",
