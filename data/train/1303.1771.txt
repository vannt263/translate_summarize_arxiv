    "in the absence of general principles accounting for the evolution of non - equilibrium systems , kinetic ising models have been used to characterize a large variety of slow non - equilibrium processes @xcite . among the most ubiquitous of these latter ,",
    "the coarsening dynamics after a sudden quench from a disordered phase at high temperatures to an ordered one below the critical point still remains a subject of much interest and debate @xcite . for _ pure _ substrates it is by now established that coarsening domains are characterized by a single time - dependent length scale growing as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dynamic exponent of the universality class to which the dynamics belongs .",
    "depending on whether or not the order parameter is preserved by this latter , e.g. kawasaki @xcite or glauber @xcite dynamics , the network of ( ferromagnetic ) domains will coarsen respectively according to a sub - diffusive lifshitz - slyozov growth ( @xmath2 , see however ref.@xcite ) , or following a plain diffusive allen - cahn behavior ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .    on the other hand , the case of coarsening systems with quenched disorder substrates modelling the effects of various experimental situations has also received considerable attention @xcite , especially in the context of random field and random bond ising models @xcite .",
    "in general , it is expected that quenched impurities play the role of energy barriers slowing down coarsening domains , the boundaries of which move by thermal activation over the landscape of these trapping centers @xcite . however , it is not yet clear whether universal growth can take place at late evolution stages in the presence of strong disorder .",
    "recent monte carlo simulations @xcite of the glauber dynamics using random ferromagnetic couplings drawn from uniform probability distributions suggest that after long pre - asymptotic crossovers the final growth in one dimension ( 1d ) recovers the usual diffusive behavior referred to above , while becoming logarithmically slow in the two - dimensional case . for the 1d situation",
    "this is somehow intriguing as already at the level of a plain alternating - bond or dimerized chain @xcite the dynamic exponents are known to be non - universal and sub - diffusive ( @xmath4 ) .    as part of the ongoing efforts in this context , here",
    "we revisit the 1d glauber disordered dynamics in terms of bilinear fermion fields associated to the kinetics of its kinks or domain walls .",
    "here , we rather focus on the dynamic exponent characterizing the actual growth of relaxation times @xmath5 with equilibrium correlation lengths @xmath6 , which according to critical dynamic theories @xcite should scale as @xmath7 .",
    "but it is known @xcite that this latter exponent coincides with @xmath1 because at times comparable with @xmath5 the average domain size becomes of order @xmath6 , so both descriptions are ultimately equivalent at large scales of space and time .",
    "the idea is to avoid the problem of dealing with prohibitively long transient regimes by pinpointing directly the relaxation time embodied in the spectrum gap of the evolution operator which , for that purpose , will be constructed and diagonalized in a domain wall representation .",
    "although the critical point is strictly zero , the analysis is kept within low temperature regimes ( with @xmath6 and @xmath5 becoming both arbitrarily large there ) , otherwise the dynamics would be rapidly arrested @xcite owing to the proliferation of large quantities of metastable states .",
    "the disorder considered throughout may include either exchange couplings of a single type ( ferro or antiferromagnetic ) or mixed ones , though as we shall see in a moment , the dynamics of these situations can be mapped onto each other via a simple spin transformation .",
    "the outline of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the basic kinetic steps under random spin exchanges using a kink or dual representation , and write down the underlying glauber generator in quantum spin notation . exploiting detailed balance @xcite",
    "we then recast this latter operator in terms of bilinear and symmetric fermion forms , thus allowing to evaluate its spectra through the solution of a secular problem whose dimensions grow linearly with the system size . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results arising from the numerical diagonalizations of this problem both for binary and gaussian disorder realizations .",
    "non - universal dynamic exponents as well as scaling forms drawn from the exact solution of the dimerized chain are then proposed and seen to be consistent with some of our numerical findings . however , when the width of the gaussian disorder exceeds a certain threshold the relaxation time grows in a rather different ( non - power - law ) and much faster form .",
    "we close with sec .",
    "iv which contains a recapitulation along with brief remarks on open issues and possible extensions of this work .",
    "let us consider the glauber dynamics of the ising chain hamiltonian @xmath8 with @xmath9 spins @xmath10 and disordered couplings @xmath11 chosen arbitrarily with any sign and strength .",
    "unless stated otherwise , periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) will be used throughout .",
    "the system is in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath12 , which causes the states @xmath13 to change by random flipping of single spins .",
    "the probability per unit time @xmath14 or transition rate for the @xmath15-th spin to flip is set to satisfy detailed balance @xcite ( see below ) , so that the system relaxes to equilibrium .",
    "as is known , the simplest choice of rates complying with this condition corresponds to that of glauber @xcite @xmath16\\ , , \\\\",
    "\\label{g - rates } \\gamma_i^{\\pm } & \\equiv & \\tanh \\left ( k_i + k_{i-1 } \\right ) \\pm   \\tanh \\left ( k_i - k_{i-1 } \\right)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , and the spin flip rate @xmath18 is hereafter taken as @xmath19 .",
    "we shall always measure the temperature in energy units ; equivalently the boltzmann constant @xmath20 is set to 1 .",
    "note that the nature of the dynamics is basically unaltered by whether some or all couplings are ferromagnetic ( @xmath21 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "to check out rapidly this issue consider for simplicity a chain with open boundary conditions ( just to avoid frustration due to eventual mismatch of antiferro exchanges ) , along with the mapping @xmath23 to new spins @xmath24 . then , to preserve the energy of the mapped configurations and therefore to maintain invariant all transition rates ( these in turn depending on @xmath25 ) , clearly in the equivalent @xmath26-system all couplings must become ferromagnetic because @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of the random @xmath28 chain would then reduce to the homogeneous one .",
    "also , notice that the _ single_-spin flip dynamics maps onto itself .",
    "in that latter respect , this argumentation would _ not _ apply to the kawasaki dynamics @xcite as owing to the exchange of @xmath29-pairs under antiferro couplings , the mapping ( [ mapping ] )",
    "would then allow _ parallel _ @xmath26-pairs to flip .",
    "strictly , ising hamiltonians possess no intrinsic dynamics since all involved spin operators commute with one another .",
    "but when these systems are endowed with extrinsic transition rates @xmath30 , such as those of eq.([g - rates ] ) , their time evolution is described in terms of a markovian process governed by a master equation @xcite . for our subsequent discussion",
    "it is convenient to think of this latter as a schrdinger equation in an imaginary time @xmath31 under a pseudo hamiltonian or evolution operator @xmath32 .",
    "this provides the probability distribution to find the system in a state @xmath33 at time @xmath34 , from the action of @xmath32 on a given initial distribution , i.e. @xmath35 . to ensure equilibrium at large times ,",
    "the detailed balance condition referred to above simply requires that @xmath36 . as usual , the diagonal and non - diagonal matrix elements of this markovian operator are given respectively by @xmath37 in particular , the first non - zero eigenvalue @xmath38 of such stochastic matrix singles out the relaxation time @xmath5 in which we are interested , i.e. @xmath39 , which is the _",
    "characteristic time for any observable at a given low temperature .",
    "the case of @xmath40 just corresponds to the stationary mode .    in order to build up and diagonalize the operational analog of eq.([elements ] ) , in what follows it is convenient to work instead with the associated kink or domain wall dynamics rather than with the spin flipping process itself .",
    "both representations are depicted schematically in fig.[kinks ] .",
    "-4.1 cm ) ] for ( a ) creation - annihilation of kink pairs , and ( b ) hopping of kinks .",
    "these latter are denoted by vertical lines separating domains of opposite spin orientations.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=65.0% ] -5.75 cm    clearly from eq.([g - rates ] ) , the kink pairing and hopping rates indicated in this diagram become respectively @xmath41 thus , if we think of the corresponding kink occupation numbers ( 0,1 ) as being related to usual spin-@xmath42 raising and lowering operators @xmath43 , we can directly identify the non - diagonal operators @xmath44 associated to eq.([elements ] ) .",
    "evidently , the transitions of these dual processes will be provided by @xmath45 on the other hand , a significant simplification arises for the diagonal terms needed for conservation of probability .",
    "the former basically count the number of hopping and pairing instances at which a given kink configuration can evolve to different ones in a single step .",
    "although this would introduce two - body interaction terms of the form @xmath46 it can be readily verified that their coefficients will all cancel out so long as the rates involved are those of eq.([rates ] ) , ultimately stemming from detailed balance .",
    "thus , after some brief calculations we obtain @xmath47 and no kink interactions , irrespective of disorder in the original couplings . also , it is worth remarking that since ultimately the signs of these latter do not affect the dynamics [ eq.([mapping ] ) ] , at low temperatures and times much smaller than @xmath48^{-1 } \\}$ ] ( say with all @xmath49 ) , these kink processes can then be seen as those of a set of annihilating random walks in a disordered media @xcite .",
    "although in this analogy branching walks begin to appear at @xmath50 , yet there are some common aspects for both systems at large times ( see concluding discussion ) .",
    "to recast the non - diagonal parts of eqs.([pairs ] ) and ( [ hops ] ) into a symmetric representation , we have recourse once more to detailed balance and rotate each @xmath51 around the @xmath1 direction using imaginary angles @xmath52 .",
    "so , we consider the diagonal non - unitary similarity transformation @xmath53 for which it is straightforward to show that @xmath54 besides keeping unaltered the algebra of @xmath55 . after this pseudo spin rotation",
    "the above non - diagonal operators therefore transform as @xmath56 while leaving eq.([diagonal ] ) invariant .",
    "thus , we are left with a bilinear hermitian form whose spectrum gap embodies the wanted dynamic exponents referred to in sec .",
    "i. in passing , it is worth mentioning that eqs.([diagonal ] ) , ( [ s - pairs ] ) and ( [ s - hops ] ) also define an anisotropic @xmath57 chain under both inhomogeneous couplings @xmath58 and transverse fields @xmath59 .",
    "however , the commutation algebra of its constituents pauli matrices , as well as that of the above raising and lowering operators , would complicate the analysis .",
    "fortunately , since the parity of kinks is conserved throughout and all couplings extend just to nearest - neighbors , a jordan - wigner transformation to spinless fermions @xmath60 @xcite enables us to progress further . with the aid of the real symmetric and antisymmetric tridiagonal @xmath61 matrices ( with boundaries ) @xmath62 and @xmath63 , defined respectively as    @xmath64    the jordan - wigner representation of spins finally lead us to the bilinear fermionic form @xmath65\\,.\\ ] ] the boundary matrix elements in @xmath62 and @xmath63 are especially aimed for pbc by respectively taking account of the contributions of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "since the number of kinks @xmath68 under pbc is always even , only anticyclic conditions must be used in those boundary terms .    following the standard literature @xcite",
    ", this quadratic form can be recasted by means of a canonical ( unitary ) transformation into new @xmath69-fermions such that @xmath70 = e_n\\ , b_n$ ] , and therefore @xmath71 here , the additive constants are obtained by the invariance of the trace of @xmath32 , whereas the eigenvalues @xmath72 of its elementary excitations are given by the solutions of either of the following two @xmath61 secular equations @xcite @xmath73 because @xmath74 the above products are symmetric and hence diagonalizable , both being in turn represented by real five - diagonal matrices ( plus boundaries ) , as if they were single particle hamiltonians with hoppings terms up to next - nearest neighbors . on the other hand , since by construction",
    "@xmath32 is a stochastic operator its vacuum energy always vanishes and therefore all eigenvalues should be constrained as @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "this is an issue which we shall make use of as a consistency test in the numerical diagonalizations of sec .",
    "the wanted relaxation time will then emerge by averaging the spectrum gap of this latter secular problem over several of its disorder realizations .      before continuing with the numerical analysis of eq.([secular ] ) we pause to consider briefly the dynamics arising from a periodic array of @xmath77-@xmath78 couplings over odd and even bonds , say .",
    "the above @xmath79 and @xmath80 become @xmath81 . as",
    "already this situation is capable of yielding non - universal exponents @xcite , it is instructive to see how these are recovered within the context discussed so far .",
    "we begin by fourier transforming the @xmath60 operators of eq.([bilinear ] ) to a set of wave fermions @xmath82 @xmath83 with @xmath84 wave numbers @xmath85 accounting of the anticyclic conditions referred to above .",
    "the @xmath86 phase factors are just aimed at producing a real representation of @xmath32 when expressed in terms of @xmath87 s and @xmath88 s . after introducing the @xmath89 matrices ,",
    "@xmath90 parametrized as @xmath91 it is readily found that the problem splits into subspaces involving only the occupation numbers and pairing states of four fermions .",
    "specifically , the dynamics is decomposed as @xmath92 where @xmath93 which is the bilinear counterpart of eq.([bilinear ] ) in this momentum space . hence",
    ", the solution of the secular equation ( [ secular ] ) here reduces to the diagonalization of either of the products @xmath94 of the @xmath95 matrices",
    "@xmath96 thus after straightforward algebraic steps and taking the positive roots of the associated @xmath97 eigenvalues , we are ultimately lead to two elementary excitation bands , namely @xmath98 parity conservation of original kinks allows to create only an even number of these excitations . then",
    ", by occupying two @xmath99 levels with @xmath100 when @xmath101 , or alternatively , using @xmath102 when @xmath103 , the spectrum gap @xmath104 in the thermodynamic limit comes out to be @xmath105 on the other hand since in equilibrium all kinks become independent , the spin - spin correlation length is simply @xmath106 @xcite , thus growing as @xmath107 in the low temperature regime , say for @xmath108 . therefore using eq.([gap ] ) within that latter limit ( @xmath109 ) , we can now relate these two seemingly independent quantities via the non - universal dynamic exponents of refs.@xcite ; that is @xmath110 as expected from the simple but more general arguments given below eq.([mapping ] ) , the role of the coupling signs is irrelevant .    _ scaling regimes_. finally , and in preparation for the finite - size scaling comparisons of sec .",
    "iii under both discrete and continuous disorder , it is helpful to consider also the spectrum gap of finite chains . expanding the lower band of eq.([bands ] )",
    "to second order around either of the @xmath111 minima referred to above , and considering afterwards the scaling regime @xmath112 while holding @xmath113 finite , it can be easily verified that the gap decay exhibits the crossover @xmath114 evidently , this implies a typical arrhenius dependence @xcite for the relaxation time at low @xmath12 s , that is @xmath115 for @xmath116 , though now with energy barriers @xmath117 fixed by the interplay between temperatures and sizes , namely @xmath118 moreover , both finite - size and finite correlation length corrections to these crossovers can also be estimated by keeping next leading order terms in eq.([bands ] ) .",
    "so , these finite effects are readily found to scale as @xmath119 we will get back to these issues later on in the context of figs.[binary ] and [ fss ] of sec . iii .",
    "turning to the diagonalization of eq.([secular ] ) , in what follows we consider the cases of binary and gaussian probability distributions of disorder realizations , both taken site - independent .",
    "the coupling concentration ( @xmath120 ) of the former is such that @xmath121 , whereas the latter is parametrized as usual by an average @xmath122 and variance @xmath123 .",
    "as the temperature is varied we focus on samples with correlation lengths close to their averaged disorder values , so as to minimize the dispersion of relaxation times resulting from finite - size effects . in the discrete case",
    "this is just equivalent to using a constant number of coupling types , i.e. the correlation length is fixed as @xmath124^{-1}$ ] . for the continuous case , in turn we select and diagonalize only those samples having @xmath125 , which amounts to work with disorder fixed ( or nearly fixed ) end - to - end spin - spin correlations .",

    "already for @xmath126 spins it is seen that standard gap deviations turn out to be fairly small . in particular , the abrupt decrease of these distributions above @xmath138 possibly signals the presence of natural upper bounds .",
    "however , for gaussian disorders with @xmath139 ( see below ) but holding @xmath6 approximately constant ( that is to say , choosing a temperature so as to keep comparable late domain sizes ) , this negative skewness is smeared out and the distributions widen significantly .",
    "as we shall see , at the level of average gaps this latter issue will be reflected in terms of a rather different decay of @xmath140 with the correlation length . in averaging these gaps we used chains of up to 3000 spins for which the sampling had to be substantially reduced ( down to 20 realizations ) .",
    "this is due to , in part , an @xmath141 increase of the diagonalization time of standard routines @xcite , as well as to a slowing down of convergence within low temperature or large @xmath6 regimes .",
    "the smallness of the spectrum gap for these regions and chain lengths also precluded us from using lanczos - based algorithms @xcite , as their convergence became even slower .",
    "ultimately , these issues set the practical limit to the idea of singling out arbitrarily large relaxation times , as intended to in sec .",
    "i.      nonetheless , the relative errors of @xmath140 yet remain small and clear trends emerge as @xmath6 is varied .",
    "fig.[binary ] illustrates the resulting average decays for several parameter values of the binary distribution , all with @xmath142 .",
    "it can be observed that within the very same scaling regime @xmath143 referred to in eq.([crossover ] ) for the plain dimerized chain , our results suggest a similar gap decay i.e. @xmath144 , and irrespective of disorder concentrations @xcite .",

    "we direct the reader s attention to fig.[gaussian]b where it turns out that the non - linear least - squares fitting of the stretched exponential form @xmath179 is able to follow very closely all numerical diagonalizations . after estimating the stretching exponents of several variances it was found that above a threshold of @xmath180 up to @xmath181 , they increase with @xmath182 as @xmath183 as is shown in the inset of fig.[gaussian]b . in nearing that critical variance however ,",

    "however , above those correlation scales the numerical gaps get progressively smaller [ in turn resulting from the even smaller squared gaps of the secular problem ( [ secular ] ) ] , which brings about a much slower and erratic convergence of diagonalization routines @xcite .",
    "recapitulating , we have constructed a fermionic bilinear representation of the 1d glauber dynamics with nearest - neighbor random interactions .",
    "this corresponds to the symmetric version [ eq.([symmetrization ] ) ] of the kink pairing and hopping processes schematized in fig.[kinks ] .",
    "the relaxation time of these latter was reduced to the evaluation of the single - particle spectral gaps of the secular problem given in eq.([secular ] ) , the diagonalization of which ultimately led us to non - universal forms of domain growth . some of these were expected and others not foreseen .",
    "the case of binary disorder lent itself more readily for comparisons with the soluble alternating chain of same coupling types ( sec .",
    "although the former situation has no exact solution , based on decimation procedures as well as on simple diffusion arguments found in the literature @xcite , the numerical coincidence of dynamic exponents with those of the soluble case should come as no surprise ( fig.[binary ] ) .",
    "in addition , the scaling function of eq.([scaling ] ) reproduced our binary data just above regions displaying incipient departures from the actual exponents ( fig.[fss ] , and rightmost part of fig.[binary ] ) .",
    "because of this scaling robustness , the same barrier values involved in the crossover of arrhenius times [ eq.([barriers ] ) ] might be expected to also hold in finite chains with binary disorder regardless of their bond concentrations . in passing ,",
    "it is worth pointing out that such manifestation of finite - size effects has been observed experimentally in single - chain magnets @xcite .",
    "some of these scaling aspects seem to also apply for gaussian disorder realizations with small relative variances ( inset of fig.[fss ] ) , for which non - universal but yet power - law forms of gap decay were obtained ( uppermost data in fig.[gaussian]a ) . however , for @xmath186 a crossover to new regimes with much faster and non - algebraic decays showed up , whilst at the more detailed level of gap distributions this brought about a significant increase of dispersion ( fig.[distributions]b ) .",
    "the stretched exponential form put forward to fit our data ( fig.[gaussian]b ) lent further support to the former hypothesis which , by inverting eq.([stretched ] ) and recalling the large scale equivalences referred to in sec .",
    "i @xcite , is tantamount to a dynamics of domain scales growing asymptotically as @xmath187 .",
    "curiously , this rather slow form of phase - ordering kinetics is reminiscent to that conjectured and studied in late coarsening stages of higher dimensions with bond disorder @xcite . in turn , this behavior may be also viewed as that corresponding to a diverging dynamic exponent , somewhat analogous to activated scaling @xcite in random transverse - field magnets .",
    "the reason for such divergence is similar to that found in disordered reaction - diffusion processes thought of as annihilating random walks in a brownian potential @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the equations of motion implicit in @xmath188 = \\sum_m \\left ( \\,a_{l , m } \\,c_m\\,+ \\,b_{l , m }",

    "the limit of zero bias would then be related to an unbounded @xmath1-exponent and to a crossing over to the stretched exponential regime conjectured above @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier on , at large times the analogy with annihilating random walks does not strictly apply but the reasoning in terms of steps of random phases goes along similar lines @xcite ( though here the mapping of the equations of motion couples the phase steps of two fields ) .    alongside these growth law evaluations",
    ", it would be interesting to also address the issue of scaling and superuniversality ( or the lack thereof ) , in two - time quantities such as autocorrelation and autoresponse functions @xcite . that research line might well be further investigated with the fermion approach discussed in this work .",
