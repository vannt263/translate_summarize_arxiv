    "the interactions of small molecules on metal surfaces play an important role in many industrial processes , such as automotive catalysis , corrosion , tribology , and gas sensing .",
    "these processes have been the subject of intensive experimental and theoretical investigation  @xcite . due to its simplicity",
    ", carbon monoxide frequently serves as a probe molecule in studies aiming to understand the nature of molecule - metal interactions .",
    "the insights gained from co / metal surface studies can then be transferred to more complex systems .",
    "a particularly well - studied system is co on the pt(111 ) surface .",
    "the adsorption of co on pt(111 ) has been studied experimentally at various coverages and pressures .",
    "@xcite scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) , and infrared adsorption ( ir ) experiments have shown that in ultra - high vacuum conditions co adsorbs on top sites exclusively at low coverages and forms a @xmath1 top - bridge overlayer at half - monolayer coverage  @xcite . yeo _",
    "et al_.  measured the co chemisorption energy calorimetrically , finding that it decreases from about 1.9  ev at low coverages to 1.2  ev at half - monolayer coverage  @xcite .",
    "several phenomenological models of co - metal surface bonding have been proposed .",
    "the most widely used conceptual framework for small molecule adsorption on surfaces is the blyholder model  @xcite , with electron donation from the co 5@xmath2 orbital to the metal and back donation from the metal to the co 2@xmath3 * , coupling the co levels to the metal @xmath4 states and @xmath5 states .",
    "building on the blyholder model , hammer _",
    "et al_.  have proposed a quantitative model for co chemisorption energy in terms of the energy of the center of the metal @xmath5 bands  @xcite .",
    "their model gives reasonably good agreement with experiment .",
    "however , the blyholder model has been recently challenged by fohlisch _",
    "et al_. , who have studied co adsorbed on the top , bridge and hollow sites on ni(100 ) with x - ray emission spectroscopy and _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite .",
    "they conclude that chemisorption energy is the result of a balance between the repulsive @xmath2 and attractive @xmath3 interactions , leading to very different electronic structures for different adsorption sites , despite similar binding energies .",
    "density functional theory  @xcite ( dft ) calculations have also been carried out to study this system at both the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite and generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite levels .",
    "et al_.studied co adsorption on a 91-atom pt cluster simulating a ( 111 ) surface  @xcite .",
    "they found the top site to be preferred , followed by bridge , with hcp less stable .",
    "et al_.found a 0.24  ev difference between the binding energies of the top and hcp sites , with the top preferred when relativistic effects were included in the calculation  @xcite .",
    "even though their study was done using periodic boundary conditions , they only used two metal layers to represent the platinum surface in their calculations .",
    "lynch and hu carried out a gga study of the adsorption of co on various pt(111 ) surface sites  @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the bottom two layers of pt were frozen at bulk positions , but the top layer was allowed to relax . using the same four - site , three - layer approximation they obtained chemisorption energies for co on fcc , hcp , top and bridge sites at quarter monolayer coverage .",
    "they obtained a top site binding energy of 1.89  ev , with bridge @xmath6 of 2.00  ev , hcp of 2.00  ev and 2.09  ev for the fcc site .",
    "the preference of hollow sites over the top site as well as the values of the binding energies are not in agreement with experiment .    in a recent study , feibelman _",
    "et al_.  showed  @xcite that the results of jennison _",
    "et al_.  and lynch _",
    "et al_.  as well as other earlier calculations suffered from several convergence problems .",
    "when approximations such as basis set size , @xmath7-point sampling and slab thickness were converged , dft calculations on the co / pt(111 ) system using a variety of functionals in pseudopotential ( psp ) , projector - augmented wave ( paw ) and full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) approaches consistently preferred the hollow site over the top site .",
    "their results are summarized in tables i and ii . while the hollow site was always preferred , the magnitude of the energy difference varied depending on the core electron approximation and exchange - correlation functional used .",
    "lda calculations give about 0.4  ev for the site preference energy ( @xmath8 ) , while gga results vary from 0.25  ev obtained with pw91/pbe ultra - soft potential calculations , to 0.13  ev obtained with pw91/paw to 0.10  ev obtained with flapw calculations .",
    "et al_.also report calculations for co / cu(111 ) and co / rh(111 ) , where gga calculations again prefer the fcc site , while experimentally the top site is preferred .",
    "gga and experiment do agree in the case of ru(0001 ) , where gga predicts the experimentally - observed adsorption on the top site . in the case of co / pd(111 )",
    ", gga predicts the experimentally - observed fcc site adsorption .",
    "they conclude that gga / lda tends to favor higher coordination , which is correct in the case of pd(111 ) but incorrect for surfaces where the top site is preferred",
    ". however , the reasons for discrepancies between lda and gga results and between psp , paw , and flapw calculations are not resolved , nor do they propose a way to estimate the site preference error .",
    "the psp - gga dft method has proven to be reliable and accurate for a wide variety of solid - state systems , so the inability of gga calculations to predict site preference of co on metal surfaces is puzzling .",
    ".results of dft calculations of feibelman _",
    "et al_.  @xcite for site preference energy for various coverages and methods .",
    "@xmath9 is the co / pt(111 ) difference between top and hcp site chemisorption energies .",
    "all energies are in ev .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     a comparison of our converged top and hollow site chemisorption energies supports the assignment of dft failure to the co bond . as shown above , the @xmath10 value is accurate within the experimental error bars , while @xmath11 is off by at least 0.18  ev .",
    "the co bond is only slightly weakened upon adsorption in the top site , as shown by experimental red - shift of only about 50  @xmath12 from the gas - phase co stretch frequency and a bond order change of 0.1 from the free co. therefore , the accurate value for @xmath13 can be considered the result of very good dft - gga error cancellation in co bond energetics .",
    "for the hcp site , with a red - shift of about 390  @xmath12 and co bond order change from 3.0 to 2.2 , the inaccurate chemisorption energy coincides with more dissimilar co bonds .",
    "the identification of @xmath14 underestimation as the major cause of site preference error is also supported by the vibrational frequency results of feibelman _",
    "et al_. the dft calculations show a shift of 214  @xmath12 in co bond stretch frequency from top to bridge site , and a shift of 308  @xmath12 from top to hcp site .",
    "these results are lower than the experimental 250  @xmath12 shift from top to bridge and the 325  @xmath12 shift from top to hcp site .",
    "since stronger bonds will usually have higher vibrational frequencies , this underestimate of the frequency shift provides additional evidence that gga underestimates the energy cost of the third co bond breaking .",
    "we have shown that for molecule - surface systems , converged psp calculations and all - electron calculations yield very similar results .",
    "the frozen core creates only a minimal inherent error , but core radius overlap can lead to larger deviations .",
    "an examination of the literature shows that dft energy errors are not limited to co adsorption on ( 111 ) metal surfaces , but occur for many reactions involving co. we have also shown that the underestimation of co bond energy loss in migration from the top to the hollow site is largely responsible for the incorrect site preference obtained by dft - gga calculations .",
    "the dependence of dft error on bond order change implies that the top site chemisorption energy obtained by dft - gga calculations is accurate , while the chemisorption energy of the hollow site is not and leads to incorrect @xmath15 .",
    "this is confirmed by our converged psp - dft results for e@xmath16 and e@xmath17 . since @xmath18 is independent of metal surface , errors in this energy will affect the @xmath15 site preference energies on many metal surfaces .",
    "we therefore propose that a simple empirical correction , based on reaction energies of small organic molecules , may permit accurate prediction of site preference .",
    "similar errors will also be found for other small molecules which experience changes in molecular bond order .",
    "the pkzb meta - gga functional  @xcite may predict the right site preference without empirical corrections , due to its superior performance in calculating the atomization energies of small molecules .",
