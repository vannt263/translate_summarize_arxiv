    "the interplay between the dynamics and the topology of network can be used to model the evolutions and structures of a wide variety of complex systems in nature and human society .",
    "a branch of dynamics research that focuses on the data traffic in the network has drawn a lot of interests .",
    "the studies in this field are mainly about capturing the attributes of the data transportation and providing hints on how to make the physical communication network more efficient .",
    "previous structure analysis based on real data spanning several disciplines revealed that many networks , including the internet , exhibit scale - free characteristics  @xcite .",
    "the degree distribution of these networks follows a power law .",
    "having explored the topological properties  @xcite , researchers habitually choose the scale - free network as the underlying structure when studying the traffic dynamics in order to observe phenomena that are close to those in the real world  @xcite .",
    "the traffic models proposed by recent works generally consist of four components : the underlying network topology , the information packet generation , the routing strategy and the packet delivering capacity of individual nodes  @xcite .",
    "they all have counterparts in the reality .",
    "take the internet as an example .",
    "the four components correspond to the physical links between computers , the average data flow , the algorithm implemented on routers and the number of parallel packet processors per site , respectively .",
    "they also have other interpretations in the field of path navigation  @xcite and organization design  @xcite . in these models , a continuous phase transition of network from free state to congested state is observed when the packet generation rate exceeds a critical value  @xcite .",
    "the core purpose of researches on these models is the optimization that enhances the network capacity which is measured by the critical value of packet generation rate .",
    "some of the previous efforts concentrate on finding a most suitable network topology  @xcite , while the others are mainly about deciding an optimal routing strategy  @xcite .",
    "however , in most of the models , constant delivering capacity is assigned to nodes .",
    "it is not economical as the loads on different nodes vary .",
    "in fact , the delivering capacities are processor resources that they should also be taken into consideration during optimization attempts .    with the hope of discovering potential possibilities of improvements on the communication network , we analyze the percentage of delivering capacities that are truly active in our traffic model where the capacities are uniformly distributed over a scale free network .",
    "it is concerned that congestion is sometimes inevitable in real lives , for example , everyone has the experience of traffic jam in rush hours , so the performance of delivering processors under congested state of network is paid special attentions .",
    "we find that some of the nodes in a weak jammed network always have constant number of packets waiting to be delivered which is the same situation as in the free state of the network , whereas the others have increasing number of packets .",
    "these two types can be distinguished by referring to the effective betweenness which is an attribute of node defined in ref .",
    "our theoretical estimates and simulations reveal that delivering capabilities of nodes are not well utilized even under the congested state of network , though optimal routing strategy based on local degree information discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite is adopted . to alleviate the waste of processor resources ,",
    "we apply a non - uniform distribution of the delivering capacities which adjusts the network to the best performance under the given conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the traffic model is described in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , theoretical analysis and simulations of the model are provided in both free and congested state .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "we use the famous model proposed by barabsi and albert  @xcite to build the underlying scale - free network . ba model , which features growth and preferential attachment ,",
    "uncovers for the first time the mechanism controlling the emergence of power - law degree distribution observed in real networks .",
    "we set the model parameters @xmath1 and network size @xmath2 . in the traffic dynamics ,",
    "network nodes are thought to be sources that produce information packets , routers that deliver packets and first - in - first - out queues with unlimited size that store to - be - processed packets . at each time step , for a node @xmath3 , the following procedures are done .",
    "a packet is generated with probability @xmath4 .",
    "the new packet whose destination is randomly selected among the other @xmath5 nodes is placed at the back of queue @xmath6 .",
    "meanwhile , packets are picked from the front of queue @xmath6 .",
    "if the picked packet has destination node @xmath6 , it is removed ; otherwise , it is delivered to node @xmath7 , one of the neighbors of node @xmath6 , with preferential weight @xmath8 where sum runs over the neighbors of node @xmath6 and @xmath9 is the degree . in eq .",
    "( [ eq_rs ] ) , we have used the optimal routing strategy based on the knowledge of only neighbor s degree  @xcite . at most @xmath10 packets can be processed by node @xmath6 if there are adequate ones in queue @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath10 is the delivering capacity of node @xmath6 .",
    "we set @xmath11 , @xmath12 following the parameters used in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to meet the conditions for the optimal routing strategy .",
    "these procedures are carried out for different @xmath6 in parallel .",
    "what we concern is the ratio between the number of packets actually processed by the network during a unit time and the total capacities assigned , which is defined as the effective delivering capacity .",
    "depending on @xmath13 , there is a continuous phase transition from free state to congested state  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath13 is small , the packets flow freely in the network as the nodes always have available processing abilities to send them to the next positions .",
    "the average travel time @xmath14 of the packets keeps constant and the total number @xmath15 of packets floating in the network at time step @xmath16 fluctuates slightly around @xmath17 .",
    "however , when @xmath13 is large , packets beyond the delivering capacities accumulate continuously in the queues , causing @xmath14 to diverge . since the number of packets the network can manage and the generation rate @xmath13 are both constants , the amount of accumulation at every time step is also constant . as a result , @xmath15 increases linearly with time . to watch the transition accurately ,",
    "we use the order parameter @xmath18 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 indicates an average over time windows of width @xmath21 . from the properties of @xmath15 , we know that @xmath18 is zero in free state but non - zero in congested state .",
    "@xmath22 , the critical value of @xmath13 , which is also the maximum generation rate keeping the system in free state , measures the network capacity .    to characterize the situation in free state",
    ", we use the method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite with our modifications .",
    "let us focus on a packet at node @xmath6 whose destination is node @xmath23 .",
    "the probability for this packet to go to node @xmath7 in one time step is denoted as @xmath24 .",
    "the precise form of @xmath24 depends on the routing strategy . for the scheme used in the model , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the element of the adjacent matrix .",
    "the strategy is markovian that each packet is delivered independently . as the network is in free state ,",
    "packets pass through nodes without any wait .",
    "the probability for the above packet to go to node @xmath7 in @xmath27 time steps is given by @xmath28 treating @xmath24 and @xmath29 as elements of matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , we have @xmath32 let us switch the focus to the centrality of node . in the traffic model ,",
    "packets coming from neighbors at a specific time step are a fraction of packets generated before .",
    "supposing that one packet with target node @xmath23 is generated at node @xmath6 each time step , we calculate @xmath33 , the average number of such packets moving to node @xmath7 at time step @xmath16 , @xmath34 as @xmath15 is stable , when @xmath35 , @xmath36 summing over all the possible sources and targets of packets yields the effective betweenness of node @xmath7 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 note that @xmath37 depends on both the routing strategy and the network topology . as the routing algorithm can vary , highly connected nodes do not always have large effective betweenness .",
    "the load @xmath39 , which is the average number of packets to be delivered by node @xmath7 every time step , is written as , @xmath40 where the first term on the right side corresponds to packets generated by @xmath7 itself while the second term corresponds to packets coming from neighbors .",
    "any node @xmath7 with @xmath41 will cause the network to be congested .",
    "thus we estimate @xmath22 by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the maximum effective betweenness . in our model , we had @xmath44 . when @xmath45 , the number of packets processed at node @xmath7 per time step is exactly its load @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , effective delivering capacity @xmath46 under free state is @xmath47 which is proportional to @xmath13 .    for @xmath13 larger than @xmath22 , eq .",
    "( [ eq_edcfree ] ) is invalid because the system is not expected to be in free state when @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_bk ] ) . back to time",
    "step @xmath48 , the average load in the network is equal to the generation rate @xmath13 .",
    "here we limit our discussion to a weak congested scenario where @xmath13 is not supposed to be extremely large so that the nodes are still able to process all the packets in the queues for the first few time steps . during these time steps",
    ", we can obtain the instantaneous load @xmath49 by replacing eq .",
    "( [ eq_bk ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq_bkt ] ) in the previous calculation for free state .",
    "as @xmath49 is a monotonically increasing function of time , it is at a later time step @xmath50 that the largest @xmath49 starts to exceed the delivering capacity @xmath51 .",
    "while the packets beyond the capacity are hindered at the corresponding node , they do not flow in the network . comparing with an imaginary case where no constraints on the delivering capacities are applied , the actual instantaneous load increases with time more slowly .",
    "though @xmath49 for @xmath52 can not be directly worked out by analytical calculation , we can predict that with more nodes suffering from packet overloading , @xmath49 increases even more slowly . after a transient time , the instantaneous load over the whole network stops increasing and remains stationary .",
    "thereafter , all the nodes in the network maintain their states .",
    "those with load higher than delivering capacity have growing queues , while the others keep constant queues .",
    "since the effective betweenness @xmath37 determines free state load @xmath39 by eq .",
    "( [ eq_l ] ) , it is plausible to suppose that nodes with greater effective betweenness become overloaded more easily .",
    "we expect a critical effective betweenness @xmath53 for current @xmath13 , which can be used as the criterion to classify the two types of node .",
    "once @xmath53 is found , effective delivering capacity can be considered by separate examinations on different types of node .    to find @xmath53 , we look at the congested state of system when @xmath35",
    ". the increasing queues are already considerably long .",
    "a newly hindered packet at a specific node will wait in the queue for so long a time that it seems to be disappeared from the views of the other nodes in the network .",
    "we assume that a node with an increasing queue is a `` target '' for information transportation where packets disappear . to make it more like a `` target '' , the @xmath51 packets it lets out at every time step",
    "are shifted to the neighbors as equivalent generation rates . by this imagination ,",
    "the original congested network turns out to be a smaller one in free state , and method for @xmath45 can be exploited .",
    "we use the following algorithm :    1 .",
