    "it is an exciting time for gravitational - wave astronomy .",
    "several ground - based gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors have reached ( or approached ) their design sensitivity , and are coordinating to operate as a global array .",
    "these include the three ligo detectors in louisiana and washington states of usa , and the virgo detector in italy .",
    "the ligo detectors have already completed their ground - breaking fifth science run .",
    "an integrated full year s worth of science data summing up to more than 10 terabytes has been accumulated from all three interferometers in coincidence .",
    "enhanced ligo started to operate in june 2009 and plan to continue until the end of 2011 with similar sensitivity  @xcite . starting in 2011 , an upgrade of enhanced ligo to advanced ligo ( expected to operate in 2014 ) will enable a 10-fold improvement in sensitivity , allowing the detectors to monitor a volume of the universe 1000 times larger than current detectors .",
    "the detection rate of signals from coalescing binaries of compact objects for these advanced detectors is estimated to be tens to hundreds of events per year  @xcite .",
    "the detection of the first gw is virtually assured with advanced ligo .",
    "coalescing binaries of compact objects consisting of neutron stars and black holes are among the most important gw sources targeted by current large scale gw detectors  @xcite as these sources produce a very distinct pattern of gravitational wave .",
    "the optimal way to detect known waveforms in noisy data is to perform a matched filtering .",
    "the matched filtering technique is performed by calculating the correlation between the gravitational wave data and a set of known or predicted waveform templates  @xcite .",
    "the post - newtonian expansion method is used to approximate the non - linear equations that describe the motion of coalescing binaries and wave generation in the creation of waveform templates  @xcite . for spinless , circular , binary systems",
    "each waveform is specified by a set of parameters including a pair of individual masses @xmath0 , constant orbital phase offset at formal coalescence @xmath1 and effective distance @xmath2 from the detector . in our tests , second order post - newtonian orbital phases and newtonian amplitude were used .    the application of the matched filtering technique to on - going searches for gravitational waves from coalescing binaries of compact objects is described in  @xcite and is summarized as follows .",
    "the template waveforms corresponding to @xmath3 and @xmath4 form an orthonormal set  @xcite . for a given mass pair @xmath0 ,",
    "the waveforms with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , denoted @xmath5 and @xmath6 are approximately related by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fourier transform of @xmath9 . exploiting this , the matched - filter output @xmath10 is a complex time series defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the one - sided strain noise power spectral density , @xmath13 is the fourier transform complex conjugate of the detector s calibrated strain data @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the matched - filter response of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the matched - filter response of @xmath18 . for initial ligo detectors ,",
    "@xmath12 is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the noise power spectral density from the science requirement document is used  @xcite .",
    "maximizing over the coalescence phase @xmath1 , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath21 is the absolute value of the scalar product between a normalized template and the detector output in frequency domain  @xcite @xmath22 where the normalization factor @xmath23 is calculated from the variance @xmath24 for stationary and gaussian noise , this @xmath25 is the optimal detection statisticc for a single detector .",
    "the number of templates needed depends on the parameter volume needed to be searched .",
    "the two masses of the compact binary objects were used as the main parameters in our experiment as we were focusing on spinless and circular binaries of compact objects .",
    "the low frequency cutoff was set to be 40 hz while high frequency cutoff is the nyquist frequency ( half of the sampling frequency , 2 khz in our case ) or the frequency of innermost stable circular orbit ( isco , e.g.  @xcite ) for the analyzed template , whichever is lower . in our experiments , the mass ranges were varied and the number of templates corresponding for each mass range was calculated .",
    "the mass ranges and their corresponding number of templates are listed in table  [ table : numtemplates ] . in order to achieve @xmath26 mismatch ( i.e. , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the expected snr when template waveform exactly matches the signal in the data ) ,",
    "thousands of templates are required  @xcite to analyze a data segment for mass ranges of 1.411 solar masses for each individual member of the binary . in the currently running search pipeline described in  @xcite ,",
    "each data segment is made up of 256 seconds of detector data down - sampled to 4096 hz giving @xmath29 data points .",
    "this means that thousands of ffts , each of approximately 1 million data points , are required to filter one data segment through the template bank .",
    ".mass ranges and their corresponding number of templates obtained from running the actual template generating program in the ligo searching pipeline valid for ligo hanford detector h1 .

    "about 4x speed - up can be achieved by simply enabling this cuda fft interface for lal ( figure  [ inspiraltimes ] and figure  [ inspiralfactor ] ) .",
    "the run time of the inspiral pipeline was shown in figure  [ inspiraltimes ] and the speed - up factor was shown in figure  [ inspiralfactor ] .",

    "it is shown that , at about 700 templates , the inspiral search using the original @xmath30 implementation took about 6 hours to complete , while it required only about 20 minutes to complete with our gpu implementation .",
    "the speed - up factor of the gpu implementation compared to the cpu - only implementation is shown in figure  [ fig : chisqspeedupfac ] .",
    "the vertical axis shows the speed - up factor  the run time of the original cpu - only implementation divided by the run time of the gpu implementation .",
    "about 16 times speed - up was observed .",
    "this means that the number of computers needed to perform the analysis in the same amount of time can be significantly reduced .",
    "a normal computer with integrated graphics should consume about @xmath31 of power , or @xmath32 for 16 single core computers , or @xmath33 for 4 quad core computers . in comparison , a single computer with geforce 8800 ultra consumes about @xmath34 of power .",
    "we could save some hardware costs and also reduce power consumption by a significant amount .",
    "veto enabled , both with and without gpu acceleration .",

    ", height=326 ]    ) using the cuda implementation of the @xmath30 calculation.,height=326 ]    an accuracy test was performed by calculating the fractional difference between the outputs produced by the new inspiral search with cuda fft including the parallel @xmath30 implementation and the original inspiral search with fftw in the mass range of 3.0 - 11.0 solar masses .",
    "about @xmath35 events were identified from the data , each with measured snr and @xmath36 values .",
    "we found that more than 99% of the snrs had less than 0.03% difference , while 99% of the @xmath30 values had less than 0.5% difference .",
    "we have shown that gpus can significantly improve the speed of gravitational wave data analysis .",
    "a speed - up of 4 to 5 fold in the existing inspiral search pipeline can be achieved by simply enabling the cuda fft .",
    "note that the cuda fft has already been introduced to lal , meaning that other gw search pipelines can use it provided gpus are available .",
    "we achieved a 16 fold speed - up in total by using a specially - written parallel gpu implementation of the @xmath36 test , a waveform consistency test used within the pipeline .",
    "we expect further speed - ups if we are allowed to change some of the search parameters .",
    "for instance , if we change the number of data points for ffts from the currently used 1 million to 4 millions , another factor of 2 speed - up can be achieved .",
    "also , further acceleration is expected if we replace more components in the pipeline with specially - written gpu implementations .",
    "our experiments were performed using a single gpu , while current new personal computers can be equipped with more than 3 gpus .",
    "we would expect more than 48 fold speed - up using a 3 gpus system when running a single - threaded search pipeline .",
    "furthermore , if we can use the newest gpu on the market , which has about 1 tflops of computing power , and assuming that the performance of these gpus scales linearly , we would expect more than a 100 fold speed - up in a single core desktop computer .",
