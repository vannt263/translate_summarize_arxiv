    "a fundamental complication is that the distribution of the particles over all available energy states  the level populations or occupation numbers  in turn affect the radiation field via the effects of absorptivity and emissivity on the radiation transport .",

    "a model atom comprises , on one hand , data to specify the structure of the atom / ion like energy levels , statistical weights and ionization potentials . on the other hand , the transitions among the individual states need to be described , requiring oscillator strengths , cross - sections for photoionization and collisional excitation / ionization , etc . the number of levels in a model atom amounts typically to several tens to several hundred in modern work , and the number of transitions from hundreds to many ( ten-)thousands .    as only a very limited amount of atomic data",

    "the remainder of data  still the bulk by number  has to be approximated for practical applications .",

    "nowadays , the question is often not _ whether _ to use _ ab - initio _",
    "data for the model atom construction , but _ which _ of the available datasets to adopt .",
    "this is a matter of experience and familiarity with atomic physics .",
    "the quality of agreement of _ ab - initio _ results with available experimental data should certainly guide the decision .",
    "a first important step is to check how well the _ ab - initio _ calculations reproduce the observed energies of the levels in an atom / ion .",
    "a comparison of observed and computed oscillator strengths and cross - sections for reactions gives further indications ( see for example reviews by williams  @xcite ; kjeldsen  @xcite ) .",
    "the latter will typically be possible only for ground and metastable states , but the opportunity for constraining the accuracy of the theoretical data should not be missed .",
    "another criterion is the agreement between length and velocity forms of oscillator strengths to verify the internal consistency of the _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "eventually , different model atoms may be constructed using the alternatives as input data to decide empirically which dataset should be preferred for the practical work .",
    "experience is also the key in deciding how extended a model atom should be and which transitions should be considered .",
    "nature realises all possibilities , but we have to handle the mathematical solution of a set of equations describing the physics packed into a ( restricted ) model . in particular , the numerical solution of the set of linear equations ( [ rateeq ] ) requires to be handled carefully .",
    "precautions need to be taken to keep the numerical problem well - conditioned and the algorithms stable . in practice",
    "this means that some transitions may better be ignored in a model atom , or the number of levels may be restricted in order to obtain meaningful results .",
    "larger model atoms accounting for more transitions are therefore not necessarily ` better ' , even if the individual atomic input data are of high quality .",
    "finally , execution times of the model computations are also important for the practical work .",
    "they should not be excessive , requiring a certain compactness of model atoms even for non - lte line - formation computations on prescribed model atmospheres .",
    "hence , the construction of model atoms is effectively a highly complex optimisation problem .",
    "a compromise needs to be found between comprehensiveness , accuracy , stability and efficiency .",
    "the first step in the construction of a model atom is to decide on the extension of the model : which ions , which energy levels should be included , and how ?",
    "this depends on the specific non - lte problem and may range from a few levels for studies of a resonance line to many hundred  including packed ` superlevels '  if a reproduction of the complex spectra of e.g. iron group species is aspired . in the following we concentrate on the general strategy for the construction of comprehensive model atoms , which are able to reproduce practically the entire observed spectra of an ion over a wide parameter range .         in a model of the bright supergiant @xmath21ori ( b8ia ) as a function of @xmath22 for hi model atoms of different complexity : for 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 40 , 50 levels ( dotted , dashed - dotted , dash - dot - dot - dotted , long dashed , full , dashed , full thick lines ) .",
    "the lower right panel displays the behaviour of all levels in the 50-level model atom .",
    "note the rydberg states asymptotically approaching the hii limit .",
    "see the text for details . from przybilla & butler  ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "the fundamental parameter that determines which ions should be included in a model atom is the effective temperature , as this determines the energetics of the microscopic processes .",
    "the term structure of the ions provides a second criterion .",
    "hence , the main ionization stage should be adequately represented , plus usually two or three minor ionic species  which may comprise in fact the ones of particular interest .",
    "e.g. , the main ionization stage of carbon in a b0v star ( with @xmath23k ) is ciii in the line - formation region , but features of the minor species cii and civ are also present in the optical spectra .",
    "consequently , a comprehensive model atom should consider cii - iv , plus the ground level of cv .",
    "the latter has an enormous energy gap between the ground and the first excited level , of about 300ev , such that from atomic structure considerations excited cv levels can be safely ignored in the model atom .",
    "a lithium model atom for use with solar - type stars can be kept simple  detailed lii + the liii ground level  for the same reason , despite liii dominating by far in terms of population .    concerning the choice of levels to include in a comprehensive model atom there are two objective criteria available , which are tightly coupled .",
    "one is the energy gap between the energetically highest level of the ion and the continuum , as defined by the ground level of the next higher ionization stage . as a general rule",
    "the gap should be less than @xmath24 to ensure an accurate determination of ionization fractions . in order to keep a model atom robust",
    "it is recommended to include energetically higher levels than the minimum necessary to cope with a given problem .",
    "non - lte studies of the mgii @xmath254481 line may serve as an example : the line is observable from f - type to mid o - type stars . for explaining the behaviour of the line in early - type stars ( mihalas  @xcite ) it may be sufficient to consider levels up to @xmath26=5 or 6 using the criterion above , as the majority of the colliding particles will be able to facilitate ionization ( see fig .",
    "[ maxwell ] ) . however , the same model atom will not be useful for analyses of a - type stars , as only a small fraction of electrons in the high - velocity tail of the maxwell distribution will be able to overcome the reaction threshold . in that case ,",
    "completeness up to @xmath26=8 would be required , etc .",
    "the second criterion is the convergence of the behaviour of level departure coefficients @xmath27 with increasing model complexity ( for a given set of transition data ) .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ departureconvergence ] , for hydrogen model atoms considering levels up to @xmath26=10 to 50 .",
    "models with a too low a number of levels can show a different behaviour at line - formation depths than the more complex models , resulting in inaccurate predictions . an alternative formulation of this criterion is via the convergence of the line source function ( e.g. sigut  @xcite ) .    for many elements fine - structure states of a term may safely be combined into one level representing the term .",
    "this comprises , in particular , the cases that are approximated well by @xmath28-coupling .",
    "collisions couple the individual sub - levels tightly because of their small energy separations , i.e. they are in lte relative to each other .",
    "a similar opportunity for simplification of the model atom opens up for levels at higher excitation energies .",
    "the energy separations of terms decrease with increasing angular quantum number @xmath29 for the same @xmath26 , and in general with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "eventually , they may be safely grouped into one level with appropriate statistical weight .",
    "this helps to keep the number of explicit non - lte levels to be treated for elements up to about calcium below @xmath30200 , even if several ionization stages are treated simultaneously .",
    "an example of a comprehensive model atom structure is visualised in fig .  [ grotrian ] in form of a grotrian diagram , for mgi . for the heavier elements with complex electron structure like the iron group elements it may be worthwhile to consider regrouping a multitude of levels with similar properties into ` superlevels ' ( and the transitions into ` superlines ' ) , a concept first introduced by anderson  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the _ non - local _ character of the radiation field drives the stellar atmospheric plasma _ out of detailed equilibrium _ : photons can travel large distances before interacting with the particles , coupling the thermodynamic state of the plasma at different depths in the atmosphere .",
    "this affects the excitation and ionization of the material .",
    "radiative transitions obey _ selection rules_.      changes in the internal energetic state of an atom / ion can occur by the absorption / emission of photons , giving rise to spectral lines .",
    "the strength of a spectral line is basically determined by the number of absorbers ( or emitters ) and the line absorption cross - section , which is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electron charge , @xmath33 the electron mass and @xmath34 the oscillator strength .",
    "@xmath35 is the line absorption profile ( the emission line profile is identical assuming complete redistribution ) , which can be approximated well by a doppler profile in most cases when the coupled radiative transfer and statistical equations are solved to determine the level populations in the restricted non - lte approach .",

    "the in general good agreement between the op and the mchf data ( with few exceptions they follow the 1:1 relation ) and the considerable scatter in the comparison of op and nahar s @xmath37-values was one of the factors to disregard this particular set of bprm data from the model atom construction in that case",

    "heavy particle collisions may become important in special cases , however , like for cool metal - poor stars .",

    "they are only briefly described in the following for completeness , leaving it to the reader to investigate the specialist literature .",
    "_ autoionization _ can occur in complex atoms with several electrons .",
    "when two electrons are excited simultaneously , this can give rise to states below and above the ionization potential .",
    "the states above the ionization threshold may autoionize to the ground state of the ion , releasing one electron .",
    "the inverse process is also possible , and , if a stabilising radiative decay occurs within the ( short ) lifetime of the doubly excited state and [ omega ] . ]",
    ", it can give rise to an efficient recombination mechanism .",
    "this is referred to as _",
    "dielectronic recombination_. details of rate coefficient modelling can be found e.g. in badnell et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "an application in the context of wr - type central stars of planetary nebulae is discussed by de marco et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "_ charge exchange _ reactions are collisional processes between atoms / ions in which one , or more , electrons are transferred from one collision partner to the other , e.g. a@xmath94b@xmath95@xmath96a@xmath95@xmath94b , with b usually being h or he .",
    "one well - known reaction occurring in stellar atmospheres is o@xmath94h@xmath95@xmath97o@xmath95@xmath94h , which can dominate the ionization balance of oxygen as the non - lte departures of the @xmath26(hi)/@xmath26(hii ) are forced upon @xmath26(oi)/@xmath26(oii ) by this resonant reaction ( the ionization potentials of neutral hydrogen and oxygen are very similar ) , see e.g. baschek et al .",
    "( @xcite ) or przybilla et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for a discussion . a list of reaction playing a possible role in astrophysical plasmas and tabulated reaction rates",
    "are provided e.g. by arnaud & rothenflug  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the question whether a model atom is realistic can only be answered by comparison with observation .",
    "one needs to test whether the model atom is comprehensive enough , i.e. whether the level structure and all relevant connecting transitions are considered properly and whether the atomic data used are sufficiently accurate .",
    "usually , this should give rise to an iterative process : a stepwise improvement of the model atom by empirical selection of the ` best ' input data . the aim is to single out _",
    "one _ model atom , that reproduces the observed spectra closely _ at once _",
    ", independent of the plasma conditions ( atomic properties are independent of environment ) .         in order to give an idea on the practical approach for performing such tests we discuss an example .",
    "synthetic line profiles from calculations with two different model atoms are compared in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ photoeffects ] .",
    "while the strong cii @xmath254267 transition is highly sensitive to non - lte effects  in particular to the photoionization cross - sections adopted  , the other line is virtually insensitive to any model atom realisation using reasonable atomic input data ( it is ` in lte ' ) .",
    "such a sensitivity is one of the keys to select the ` right ' photoionization data for the model atom construction .",
    "the second ingredient in this process is the comparison with observations , here for stars in a temperature sequence ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ photoeffects ] ) .",
    "this is in order to test the reaction of the model realisations to a hardening radiation field .",
    "the line ` in lte ' serves as reference and the goal of the model atom optimisation is to minimise the differences in the derived abundances from the various indicators . in this case",
    "it was shown that ill - chosen atomic data can result in line abundance differing by up to 0.8dex ( np08 ) , which helped to solve one notorious non - lte problem of stellar astrophysics ( nieva & przybilla  @xcite ) .",
    "ideally , the observations used for the model atom calibration should range from the far - uv to the near - ir in order to test as many channels ( spectral lines ) as possible , even those that may be irrelevant for practical applications later . at the same time",
    ", the observations should cover an as wide range of plasma parameters as possible : high - density , i.e. collisionally dominated , environments like the photospheres of dwarf stars and low - density plasmas ( those dominated by radiative processes ) as encountered in ( super-)giants should be considered , at different temperatures . where possible , also the metallicity dependence of non - lte effects should be investigated to test the response of a model atom to a varying radiation field , e.g. by considering stars of population  i and ii .",
    "further tests may include more ` exotic ' environments , like he - dominated plasmas in compact subdwarfs ( przybilla et al .",
    "@xcite ) or giant extreme helium stars ( przybilla et al .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "such a comprehensive approach involving satellite observations may not be feasible in almost all cases . however , high - quality spectroscopy from the ground with modern echelle spectrographs is often sufficient to provide the means to facilitate proper model atom testing .",
    "figure  [ testing ] visualises the channels available for testing a model atom of cii using the optical spectra of early b - type stars .",
    "note that despite this comprises a fair number of energy levels and transitions from several multiplets , only a small fraction of the entire model atom can be really scrutinised by this .",
    "consideration of lines from additional ionization stages ( ciii and civ in that case , np08 ) may put further constraints , as the full set of observed lines should be reproduced closely by the model simultaneously .",
    "the above example is typical for elements with relatively simple electron structure .",
    "more complex electron configurations like the open 3@xmath98-shells in the iron - group members pose a larger challenge at first glance , but the enormous number of observable transitions puts many constraints on the model atom construction as well . the real challenge are therefore the low - abundance light elements lithium , beryllium and boron , and in particular their alkali - like ions . there",
    ", typically only the resonance lines are observable , which gives only marginal constraints for tests of the model atom .",
    "where possible , resonance lines from another ionization stage should therefore be investigated , or subordinate lines that may become observable in stars with particular high abundance in the element under study .",
    "it is of utmost importance to use realistic atmospheric structures for testing model atoms , requiring a proper determination of the stellar atmospheric parameters , see nieva & przybilla ( this volume ) .",
    "well - studied standard stars like the sun ( g2v ) , procyon ( f5iv - v ) , vega ( a0v ) , @xmath99sco ( b0.2v ) or arcturus ( k1.5iii ) with tight constraints on their atmospheric parameters are therefore primary objects for the comparison of the models with observation . however",
    ", further stars that bracket the extremes of the parameter space to be studied have also to be considered .",
    "the plethora of possibilities implies that the model atom construction does not result in a unique solution .",
    "a good reproduction of observations may be achieved by a whole family of models .",
    "the main insight is that there are many insufficient model atoms , but few adequate ones . in consequence ,",
    "non - lte analyses are not superior to lte investigations _ per se _ , but require robust and comprehensive model atoms . in view of the increasing availability of accurate and precise atomic data from _",
    "ab - initio _ calculations and experiments one is faced by a perpetual challenge : the impact of new high - quality atomic data should be tested on the modelling whenever such become available . of course , the same is true for new observations that may facilitate the predictive power of the models to be tested further by opening up other channels for the model atom calibration .",
