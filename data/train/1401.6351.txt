    "no such accuracy is required and it would be valuable to have simple analytical expressions instead , which allow to estimate main thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss such an approach for estimating thermodynamic properties of yukawa systems .",
    "although not extremely accurate , it is very simple and allows to catch the essential qualitative properties of these systems .    in the following we consider an idealized model consisting of point - like charged particles in the neutralizing surrounding medium .",
    "the mobile medium is responsible for screening so that the resulting pair interaction potential between the particles has the yukawa form ( [ yukawa ] ) .",

    "although the obtained analytical results do not yield very high accuracy ( in particular , in the regime of strong coupling and weak screening ) , they provide convenient formulas to describe the essential qualitative properties of yukawa systems .",
    "we note , however , that the idealized model does not account for some important properties of real systems .",
    "some of these properties , which are relevant to complex plasmas are as follows : ( i ) particles are not point - like , the typical ratio of the particle size to the plasma screening length can vary in a relatively wide range ; ( ii ) there is a wide region around the particle where the ion - particle interaction is very strong , which results in non - linear screening ; ( iii ) particle charge is not fixed , but depends on complex plasmas parameters ( e.g. on the particle density ) ; ( iv ) the average density of ions and electrons is not fixed , but is related to the particle density and charge via the quasineutrality condition .",
    "most of these properties are also to a large extent relevant to colloidal dispersions .",
    "clearly these properties can considerably affect the thermodynamics . from this perspective , accurate results for an idealized model can be considered as reference data for more advanced models .",
    "extension of simple analytical approximations , similar to that discussed in this paper , would be a reasonable strategy to study the relative importance of the above mentioned properties .",
    "we leave this for future work .",
    "the authors would like to thank satoshi hamaguchi for providing numerical data on wave dispersion relations in yukawa fluids .",
    "we appreciate funding from the russian foundation for basic research , project no .",
