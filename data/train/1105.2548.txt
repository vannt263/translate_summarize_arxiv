    "quantum correlations constitute a fundamental resource for quantum information tasks  @xcite .",

    "the research on quantum correlation measures was initially developed based on the entanglement - separability paradigm  @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , it has been perceived that entangled states are not the only kind of quantum states exhibiting nonclassical features . in this context , a suitable measure of quantum correlation has been introduced by ollivier and zurek  @xcite .",
    "this measure , which has been designated as _ quantum discord _ , is able to capture not only quantum correlations in entangled states but also in separable states .",
    "it arises as a difference between two expressions for the total correlation in a bipartite system ( as measured by the mutual information ) , which are classically equivalent but distinct in the quantum regime .",
    "remarkably , quantum discord has been revealed as a useful quantity in a number of applications , such as quantum critical phenomena  @xcite and quantum evolution under decoherence  @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum discord has also been conjectured to be a resource for speed up in quantum computation  @xcite and for locking classical correlations in quantum states  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", generalizations of quantum discord to multipartite states have been considered in different scenarios  @xcite .",
    "one possible approach is based on directly generalizing the quantum mutual information to a multipartite system , even though nonunique generalizations are possible in this situation  @xcite .",
    "another approach is to define from the beginning a measure based on the relative entropy , which allows for a unified view of different correlation sources , such as entanglement , quantum discord , and dissonance  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "the aim of this work is to propose a global measure of quantum discord obtained by a systematic extension of the bipartite quantum discord , with operational appeal and satisfying the basic requirements of a correlation function . in this direction",
    ", we suitably recast the standard bipartite quantum discord defined in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of relative entropy and local von neumann measurements , whence a natural multipartite measure for quantum correlations emerges .",
    "this measure  named here as _ global quantum discord _ ( gqd )  is symmetric with respect to subsystem exchange and shown to be non - negative for arbitrary states .",
    "we illustrate our results by computing the tripartite gqd in the werner - ghz state and by applying gqd in the characterization of the infinite - order quantum phase transition ( qpt ) in the ashkin - teller spin chain , where ordinary pairwise quantum discord fails .",

    "this difference is the quantum discord @xmath21  @xcite , yielding @xmath22 note that @xmath21 is defined as a non - negative asymmetric quantity that depends on @xmath23 .",
    "this dependence can be eliminated by minimizing @xmath21 over all measurement bases @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the quantum relative entropy is a measure of distinguishability between two arbitrary density operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which is defined as  @xcite @xmath27 we can express the quantum mutual information @xmath19 as the relative entropy between @xmath3 and the product state @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 in order to express the measurement - induced quantum mutual information @xmath30 in terms of relative entropy , we need to consider a non - selective von neumann measurement on part @xmath2 of @xmath3 , which yields @xmath31 moreover , tracing over the variables of the subsystem @xmath1 , we obtain @xmath32 where we have used that @xmath33 .",
