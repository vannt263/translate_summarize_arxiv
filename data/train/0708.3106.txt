    "at high energies strong interactions enter a regime in which cross sections are comparable to the `` geometric size '' of the hadrons , and unitarity becomes an essential feature of the dynamics . by analogy with quantum  mechanical scattering from a black disk , in which particles with impact parameters @xmath1 experience inelastic interactions with unit probability , this is known as the black  disk regime ( bdr ) .",
    "the approach to the bdr is well  known in soft interactions , where it generally can be attributed to the `` complexity '' of the hadronic wave functions .",
    "it is seen _ _ e.g.__in phenomenological parametrizations of the @xmath2 elastic scattering amplitude , whose profile function @xmath3 approaches unity at @xmath4 for energies @xmath5 .",
    "more recently it was realized that the bdr is attained also in hard processes described by qcd , due to the increase of the gluon density in the proton at small @xmath6 .",
    "theoretically , this phenomenon can be studied in the scattering of a small  size color dipole ( @xmath7 ) from the proton .",
    "numerical studies show that that at tev energies the dipole ",
    "proton interaction is close to `` black '' up to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this fact has numerous implications for the dynamics of @xmath2 collisions at the lhc , where multiple hard interactions are commonplace .",
    "for example , it predicts dramatic changes in the multiplicities and @xmath9 spectra of forward particles in central @xmath2 collisions compared to extrapolations of the tevatron data @xcite .",
    "absorption and energy loss of leading partons by inelastic interactions in the bdr can also account for the pattern of forward pion production in @xmath10@xmath11 collisions at star @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting is the question what the approach to the bdr implies for exclusive hard diffractive scattering , @xmath12 . in such processes a high  mass system ( @xmath13 is produced in a hard process involving exchange of two gluons between the protons . at the same time , the spectator systems must interact in a way such as not to produce additional particles .",
    "this restricts the set of possible trajectories in configuration space and results in a suppression of the cross section compared to non - diffractive events . for soft spectator interactions this suppression",
    "is measured by the so  called rapidity gap survival ( rgs ) probability .",
    "important questions are ( a ) what role the bdr plays in traditional soft  interaction rgs ; ( b ) how the physical picture of rgs is modified by hard spectator interactions in the bdr at lhc energies ; ( c ) how possible correlations between hard and soft interactions affect rgs . these questions can be addressed in a recently proposed partonic description of exclusive diffraction @xcite , based on gribov s parton picture of high  energy hadron ",
    "hadron scattering .",
    "this approach allows for a model  independent treatment of the interplay of hard and soft interactions , and for the consistent implementation of the bdr at high energies ( for details , see ref .",
    "a simple `` geometric '' picture of rgs is obtained in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite in the approximation where hard and soft interactions are considered to be independent .",
    "the hard two  gluon exchange process can be regarded as happening locally in space ",
    "time on the typical scale of soft interactions . in the impact parameter representation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rgs]a ) the rgs probability can be expressed as    [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     at lhc energies even highly virtual partons ( @xmath14 ) with @xmath15 experience `` black '' interactions with the small@xmath6 gluons in the other proton .",
    "this new effect causes an additional suppression of diffractive scattering which is not included in the traditional rgs probability @xcite .",
    "one mechanism by which this happens is the absorption of `` parent '' partons in the qcd evolution leading up to the hard scattering process ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hardscreen]a )",
    ". specifically , in higgs production at the lhc the gluons producing the higgs have momentum fractions @xmath16 ; their `` parent '' partons in the evolution ( quarks and gluons ) typically have momentum fractions of the order @xmath17 and transverse momenta @xmath18 .",
    "quantitative studies of the bdr in the dipole picture show that at the lhc energy such partons are absorbed with near  unit probability if their impact parameters with the other proton are @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hardscreen]b ) . for proton",
    " proton impact parameters @xmath20 about @xmath21 of the strength in @xmath22 comes from parton ",
    "proton impact parameters @xmath23 ( _ cf_.  fig .",
    "[ fig : rgs]a ) , so that this effect practically eliminates diffraction at @xmath20 . since @xmath20 accounts for 2/3 of the cross section",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ survb ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : rgs]b ) ] , and the remaining contributions at @xmath24 are also reduced by absorption , we estimate that inelastic interactions of hard spectators in the bdr reduce the rgs probability at lhc energies to about 20% of its soft  interaction value .",
    "( trajectories with no emissions , corresponding to the @xmath25 term in the evolution kernel , are not affected by absorption ; however , their contributions are small because they effectively probe the gluon density at the soft input scale . ) since this effect `` pushes '' diffractive @xmath2 scattering to even larger impact parameters than allowed by soft  interaction rgs it should also manifest itself in a shift of the final  state proton transverse momentum distribution to smaller values , which could be observed in @xmath9dependent measurements of diffraction at the lhc .",
    "the estimates reported here are based on the assumption that dglap evolution reasonably well describes the gluon density down to @xmath26 ; the quantitative details ( but not the basic picture ) may change if small@xmath6 resummation corrections were to significantly modify the gluon density at such values of @xmath6 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the effect of hard spectator interactions described here is substantially weaker at the tevatron energy .",
    "l0.45        the partonic approach to rgs of ref .",
    "@xcite also allows one to incorporate effects of correlations in the partonic wavefunction of the protons .",
    "they can lead to correlations between hard and soft interactions in diffraction , which substantially modify the picture of rgs compared to the independent interaction approximation .",
    "the cdf data on @xmath2 collisions with multiple hard processes indicate the presence of substantial transverse correlations of size @xmath27 between partons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ) .",
    "a possible explanation of their origin could be the `` constituent quark '' structure of the proton suggested by the instanton vacuum model of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "such correlations modify the picture of rgs in hard diffractive @xmath2 scattering compared to the independent interaction approximation in two ways @xcite . on one hand , with correlations inelastic interactions between spectators are much more likely in configurations in which two large@xmath6 partons collide in a hard process than in average configurations , reducing the rgs probability compared to the uncorrelated case . on the other hand",
    ", the `` lumpiness '' implies that there is generally a higher chance for the remaining spectator system not to interact inelastically compared to the mean  field approximation .",
    "a quantitative treatment of correlations in rgs , incorporating both effects , remains an outstanding problem .",
