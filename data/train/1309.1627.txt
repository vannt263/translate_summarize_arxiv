    "string theory provides a broader range of possibilities .",
    "new strong dynamics would generate a spectrum of new composite particles ( recall the technihadrons of classic technicolor ) , and if the new elementary particles ( akin to techniquarks ) carry qcd color , then the new composite particles occur as octets , decuplets , and other multiplets of qcd color .",
    "studies of new colored particles in the context of the large hadron collider therefore go far beyond triplets and octets @xcite , continuing several decades of interest in the range of color representations that might be realized beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd is routinely used to obtain quantitative results from the su(3 ) gauge theory of gluons and quarks .",
    "the inclusion of additional particles in an octet @xcite , sextet @xcite , or symmetric @xcite representation has also been investigated , in some cases applied to a new strong interaction rather than to qcd itself .",
    "of more direct relevance to our work is a lattice study by michael and coworkers @xcite , culminating in ref .",
    "@xcite where qcd is coupled to a new heavy color - octet particle representing the gluino of supersymmetry .",
    "given that the gluino is significantly heavier than the qcd scale , foster and michael @xcite were able to treat the gluino as a static particle , where the spin of the gluino is irrelevant so their results are applicable more generally to particles of arbitrary spin .",
    "if the static particle is sufficiently stable , then it will couple to surrounding gluons and quarks to form hadronic bound states .",
    "foster and michael used lattice qcd simulations to produce predictions for mass splittings within this new spectrum of hadrons . specifically , ref .",
