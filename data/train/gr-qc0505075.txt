    "a key unsolved problem in general relativity is to compute the gravitational radiation produced by a small object spiralling into a much larger black hole .",
    "this problem is of direct observational relevance .",
    "inspirals of compact objects into intermediate mass black holes ( @xmath0 may be observed by ligo and other ground based interferometers @xcite ; recent observations suggest the existence of black holes in this mass range @xcite .",
    "in addition , a key source for the space - based gravitational wave detector lisa is the final epoch of inspiral of a stellar - mass compact object into a massive ( @xmath1 ) black hole at the center of a galaxy .",
    "@xcite have estimated that lisa should see over a thousand such inspiral events during its multi - year mission lifetime , based on monte carlo simulations of the dynamics of stellar cusps by freitag @xcite .",
    "observations of these signals will have several major scientific payoffs @xcite :    * from the observed waveform , one can measure the mass and spin of the central black hole with fractional accuracies of order @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the spin can provide useful information about the growth history ( mergers versus accretion ) of the black hole @xcite .",
    "* likewise , one obtains a census of the inspiralling objects masses with precision @xmath3 , teaching us about the stellar mass function and mass segregation in the central parsec of galactic nuclei .",
    "* the measured event rate will teach us about dynamics in the central parsec of galaxies . *",
    "the gravitational waves will be wonderful tools for probing the nature of black holes in galactic nuclei , allowing us to observationally map , for the first time , the spacetime geometry of a black hole , and providing a high precision test of general relativity in the strong field regime @xcite .    to be in the lisa waveband , the mass @xmath4 of the black hole must be in the range @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the mass @xmath6 of the compact object and @xmath4 is therefore in the range @xmath7 .",
    "these systems spend the last year or so of their lives in the very relativistic regime close to the black hole horizon , where the post - newtonian approximation has completely broken down , and emit @xmath8 cycles of waveform @xcite .    realizing",
    "the above science goals will require accurate theoretical models ( templates ) of the gravitational waves .",
    "this is because the method of matched filtering will be used both to detect the signals buried in the detector noise , and to measure the parameters characterizing detected signals .",
    "the accuracy requirement is roughly that the template should gain or lose no more than @xmath9 cycle of phase compared to the true waveform over the @xmath10 cycles of inspiral .",
    "these sources must therefore be modeled with a fractional accuracy @xmath11 .",
    "the past several years have seen a significant research effort in the relativity community aimed at providing these accurate templates .    to date",
    ", there have been several approaches to generating waveforms .",
    "the foundation for all the approaches is the fact that , since @xmath12 , the field of the compact object can be treated as a linear perturbation to the large black hole s gravitational field . on short timescales ,",
    "the compact object moves on a geodesic of the kerr geometry , characterized by its conserved energy @xmath13 , @xmath14-component of angular momentum @xmath15 , and carter constant @xmath16 . over longer timescales ,",
    "radiation reaction causes the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 to evolve and the orbit to shrink .",
    "the various approaches are :    1 .   _",
    "use of post - newtonian methods : _ fairly crude waveforms can be obtained using post - newtonian methods @xcite .",
    "these have been used to approximately scope out lisa s ability to detect inspiral events @xcite and to measure the waveform s parameters @xcite . however , since the orbital speeds are a substantial fraction of the speed of light , these waveforms are insufficiently accurate for the eventual detection and data analysis of real signals .",
    "use of conservation laws : _ in this approach @xcite one uses the teukolsky - sasaki - nakamura ( tsn ) formalism @xcite to compute the fluxes of energy @xmath13 and angular momentum @xmath15 to infinity and down the black hole horizon generated by a a compact object on a geodesic orbit . imposing global conservation of energy and angular momentum ,",
    "one infers the rates of change of the orbital energy and angular momentum . for certain special classes of orbits ( circular and equatorial orbits )",
    "this provides enough information that one can also infer the rate of change of the carter constant @xmath16 , and thus the inspiralling trajectory .",
    "direct computation of the self - force : _ in this more fundamental approach one computes the self - force or radiation - reaction force arising from the interaction of the compact object with its own gravitational field .",
    "a formal expression for this force in a general vacuum spacetime in terms of the retarded green s function was computed several years ago @xcite .",
    "translating this expression into a practical computational scheme for kerr black holes is very difficult and is still in progress .",
    "roughly 100 papers devoted to this problem have appeared in the last few years ; see , for example poisson @xcite for an overview and references .",
    "time - domain numerical simulations : _ another technique is to numerically integrate the teukolsky equation as a 2 + 1 pde in the time domain @xcite , and to model the compact object as a finite - sized source .",
    "this approach faces considerable challenges : ( i ) there is a separation of timescales  the orbital period is much shorter than the radiation reaction timescale .",
    "( ii ) there is a separation of lengthscales  the compact object is much smaller than the black hole .",
    "( iii ) the self - field of the small object must be computed with extremely high accuracy , as the piece of the self - field responsible for the self - force is a tiny fraction ( @xmath17 ) of the divergent self - field .",
    "this approach may eventually be competitive with ( ii ) and ( iii ) but is currently somewhat far from being competitive [ flux accuracies are @xmath18 as compared to @xmath19 for ( ii ) ] .",
    "a key feature of these systems is that they evolve adiabatically : the radiation reaction timescale @xmath20 is much longer than the orbital timescale @xmath21 , by a factor of the inverse @xmath22 of the mass ratio .",
    "this has implications for the nature of the signal .",
    "the self - acceleration @xmath23 of the compact object can be expanded in powers of the mass ratio as @xmath24\\;. \\label{eq : selfaccel}\\ ] ] here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the dissipative and conservative pieces of the leading - order self - acceleration computed in refs .",
    "similarly , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the corresponding pieces of the first correction to the self - acceleration , which has not yet been computed ( although see ref.@xcite for work in this direction )",
    ".    the effect of the dissipative pieces of the self force will accumulate secularly , while the effect of the conservative pieces will not .",
    "hence the effect of the dissipative pieces on the phase of the orbit will be larger than that of the conservative pieces by a factor of the number of cycles of inspiral , @xmath29 .",
    "consider now , for example , the azimuthal phase @xmath30 of the orbit .",

    "we shall call leading - order waveforms containing only terms corresponding to @xmath32 _",
    "adiabatic waveforms_. from eq.([eq : emri_phase ] ) these waveforms are accurate to @xmath9 cycle over the inspiral ( more precisely , the phase error is independent of @xmath36 in the limit @xmath37 ) . to compute adiabatic waveforms",
    "we need only keep the dissipative piece of the self - force , and we can discard any conservative pieces . the conservation - law method discussed above yields waveforms that are accurate to this leading order , but is limited in that it can not be used for generic orbits .",
    "adiabatic waveforms will likely be sufficiently accurate for detecting inspiral events with lisa @xcite .",
    "the correction @xmath38 to the phase of the waveform can be estimated using the post - newtonian approximation , and amounts to @xmath39 cycle over the inspiral for typical parameter values . while the post - newtonian approximation is not strictly valid in the highly relativistic regime near the horizon of interest here , it suffices to give some indication of the accuracy of adiabatic waveforms .",
    "this computation is described in [ sec : accuracy ] .",
    "recently yasushi mino derived a key result that paves the way for computations of adiabatic waveforms for generic inspirals in kerr @xcite .",
    "mino showed that the time average of the self - force formula of @xcite for bound orbits in kerr yields the same result as the gradient of one half the difference between the retarded and advanced metric perturbations .",
    "this `` half retarded minus half advanced '' prescription is the standard result for electromagnetic radiation reaction in flat spacetime due to dirac @xcite .",
    "this prescription was also posited , without proof , for scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational radiation reaction in the kerr spacetime by galtsov @xcite .",
    "however , prior to mino s analysis , the prescription was not generally thought to be applicable or relevant in kerr",
    ".    as one might expect , knowledge of the infinite - time - averaged self - force is sufficient to compute the leading - order , adiabatic waveforms @xcite , although there are subtleties related to the choice of gauge @xcite .",
