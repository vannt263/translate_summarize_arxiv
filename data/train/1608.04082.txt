    "subdivision schemes generate smooth curves / surfaces from discrete data by repeated refinements .",
    "linear schemes are well understood and have been used in applications , such as computer graphics and computer aided geometric design .",
    "the typical input to these schemes consists of a mesh of vertices . for information on linear subdivision schemes",
    "see e.g. @xcite . in recent years linear schemes",
    "were adapted to refine other types of geometric objects such as sets , manifold - valued data , and nets of functions ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is motivated by the idea to design subdivision schemes generating surfaces by repeated refinements of 3d point - normal pairs . as a first step towards this aim we designed and investigated subdivision schemes generating 2d curves by repeated refinements of 2d point - normal pairs ( pnps ) .",
    "the subdivision schemes considered in this work are based on a geometric construction .",
    "these schemes are significantly different from hermite schemes , which are linear schemes refining point - tangent pairs @xcite .",
    "we plan to extend our schemes to schemes generating surfaces by refining point - normal pairs .",
    "it is important to note that point - normal pairs can be obtained from point - tangent pairs but not vice - versa .",
    "the approach taken here is similar to that taken in the adaptation of linear subdivision schemes to manifold - valued data in @xcite,@xcite and to sets in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the binary arithmetic mean in the refinement rules of linear subdivision schemes , expressed in terms of such repeated averages , is replaced by a weighted binary average of two pnps .",
    "such an average is designed here , based on a geometric construction involving a circle and hence its name _ circle average_. with this average we modify the lane - riesenfeld algorithm  @xcite , namely all spline subdivision schemes , and the 4-point scheme @xcite , @xcite to refine pnps .",
    "other modifications of these schemes which refine points are available .",
    "the most relevant to our work are @xcite,@xcite , and we plan to compare the performance of our modifications with their performance .",
    "an interpolatory scheme refining pnps , where the inserted pnp is determined by a similar construction to the circle average with weight @xmath0 , is presented in @xcite .",
    "while in @xcite , the scheme converges and the limit of the normals is equal to the normals of the limit curve , in our schemes this is not necessarily the case .",
    "yet our approach yields a variety of subdivision schemes which are not limited to a subclass of initial pnps as in @xcite .",
    "here is an outline of the paper .    in section  [ sec : average ]",
    "we first define the circle average by an explicit geometric construction , and then prove that it is indeed an average . for",
    "that we prove the _ consistency property _ , which guarantees that all repeated averages originating from two pnps can be expressed as one average with an appropriate weight .",
    "we also show that the circle average approximates well short pieces of smooth curves , which makes it a good candidate for modifying linear subdivision schemes refining points to schemes refining pnps , by the approach mentioned above . in section",
    "[ sec : subdivision ] we modify in this way the lane - riesenfeld algorithm and also the interpolatory 4-point scheme .",
    "we prove that the modified schemes are convergent , and demonstrate by figures and a video their editing capabilities .",
    "we provide also a simple method for defining initial normals , in case the input consists of control points only .",
    "the advantage of the resulting schemes over the corresponding linear schemes is demonstrated for initial control polygons with edges of significantly different lengths .",
    "in this section we present the construction of a weighted binary average of two pairs each consisting of a point and a normal .",
    "all the weighted averages of the two pairs are located on a circle .",
    "when the two pairs are sampled from a circle , the weighted averages stay on that circle .",
    "we first introduce a new binary operation and then show that it is an average , which we term _ the circle average_. given a real weight @xmath1 $ ] and two pairs , each consisting of a point and a normal unit vector @xmath2 and @xmath3 in @xmath4 space , we produce a new pair @xmath5 denoted by @xmath6 . for @xmath7",
