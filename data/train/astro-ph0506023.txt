    "since the launch of the  and  x - ray observatories , the number of supernovae ( sne ) detected in their near aftermath has more than doubled ( see immler & lewin 2003 for a review article ) .",
    "the high - quality x - ray spectra have confirmed the validity of the circumstellar interaction models ( see fransson , lundqvist & chevalier 1996 and references therein ) which predict a hard spectral component ( @xmath5  kev ) for the forward shock emission during the early epoch ( @xmath6  days ) and a soft thermal component ( @xmath7  kev ) for the reverse shock emission after the expanding shell has become optically thin .",
    "the soft emission component dominates the x - ray output of the interaction regions due to its higher emission measure and higher electron densities .",
    "this expected ` softening ' of the x - ray spectrum has been observationally confirmed for a number of young sne , such as sne 1978k ( schlegel et  al .",
    "2004 ) , 1979c ( immler et  al .",
    "2005 ) , 1993j ( zimmermann & aschenbach 2003 ) , 1999em and 1998s ( pooley et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "where sufficient data are available , x - ray lightcurves could be established over significant time scales ( e.g. , @xmath8  years for sne 1978k and 1979c ; schlegel et  al .",

    "however , little is known about the transition from a young sn into its supernova remnant ( snr ) phase as there have been only few detections of intermediate - age ( 25300  yrs ) sne in the radio and none in x - rays .",
    "while the x - ray emission of sne is dominated by the interaction of the shock with the ambient circumstellar matter ( csm ) , likely deposited by the progenitor s stellar wind , the emission from a snr is thought to originate in the shocked interstellar medium ( ism ) . at an age of @xmath10  years ,  is the oldest sn detected in x - rays and closes this gap which allows one , for the first time , to witness the transition from a sn to its snr phase .    in this paper",
    "we report on the  x - ray observation of , as well as previous x - ray data from  and . in  [ data ] we briefly describe the data and analysis thereof and report on the x - ray spectrum and multi - mission x - ray lightcurve in  [ results ] .",
    "we discuss the results in the context of the csm interaction model and put  in the context of the evolution from a sn to a snr in  [ discussion ] , followed by a summary in  [ summary ] .",

    ", we detect soft ( @xmath0  kev ) x - ray emission from  with a luminosity of @xmath69 , 35  years after its outburst . the source is spatially resolved from the nearby hii region ngc  5455 ( @xmath38 ) , which is observed at a @xmath70 flux level compared to .",
    "contamination of the previous  data of  with the hii region should therefore be minimal , especially when kept in mind that at earlier epochs  was significantly brighter , while the hii region presumably has a constant flux .    given the information from the high - resolution spatial imaging with , we recover x - rays from  in the  hri and pspc observations .",
    "is not conclusively detected in three recent ( 20022005 )  observations due to the extent of the source ( @xmath55 ) as imaged by the pn and mos instruments , and positional offsets larger than the instrumental uncertainties ( @xmath38 ) .    in combination ,",
    "an x - ray rate of decline of @xmath3 with index @xmath4 is similar to other x - ray sne ( e.g. , sn  1999em , pooley et  al .",
    "2002 ; sn  1986j , houck et  al .",
    "this strengthens the case that the emission is due to the sn itself , even though a variable source in the environment of ngc  5455 can not be entirely ruled out .",
    "the lack of x - rays above 2  kev confirms that the emission is soft and of possible thermal original .",
    "such a soft emission is expected for the late emission of a sn , where the shocked emission originates from the reverse shock region .",
    "assuming that the emission arises from shock heated plasma deposited by the progenitor s stellar wind , a mass - loss rate of @xmath2 is inferred for the late epoch observed with .",
    "a similar mass - loss rate was inferred from radio observations [ @xmath71 ; weiler 1993 ] .",
    "the mass - loss rates for the earlier epoch are slightly higher and might indicate an evolution in the mass - loss rate history of the progenitor ( see tab .",
    "[ tab ] ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the lack of knowledge about the shock front velocity precludes a more detailed study .",
    "if the shock front experienced a significant deceleration , as expected when the shock has swept up a significant amount of csm , the lower inferred mass - loss rates for the later epochs would be even lower ( see the discussion about the mass - loss rate history of sn  1979c in immler et  al .",
    "2005 ) . however , given the uncertainties in the derived x - ray luminosities due to a possible residual contamination of the and  data caused by their larger point - spread functions ( psf ; @xmath38 fwhm for the  hri ; @xmath72@xmath73 fwhm for the   epic instrument ; @xmath50 fwhm for the  pspc ) , the apparent increase of the mass - loss rate at earlier epochs is not regarded as significant .",
    "interestingly , the mass - loss rates are higher for the instruments with the largest psf ( epic and pspc ) . if the mass - loss rates inferred from the instruments with the smallest psf are compared [ @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the hri and acis , respectively ] , no statistically significant differences are observed .",
    "we therefore conclude that  shows a mass - loss rate which is consistent with being constant over a period of 1235  years after the peak optical brightness ( july 30 , 1970 ; detre 1970 ) , corresponding to @xmath76 11,00031,000 years in the stellar wind age using the conversion @xmath77 and assuming a stellar wind speed of @xmath78 and a shock front velocity of 9,000@xmath79 .",
    "the measured mass - loss rate for  is similar to those inferred for other type ii sne , which typically range from @xmath80 to @xmath81 ( see immler & lewin 2003 ) .",
    "this is indicative that the x - ray emission arises from shock - heated csm deposited by the progenitor rather than shock - heated ism , even at this late epoch after the outburst .",
    "1.0 cm    ( 3,6.4 ) ( -0.9,0 )    ( 1,1 )    in order to explain the x - ray luminosities of snrs such as cas a ( @xmath82 at an age of @xmath83  years ) , mass - loss rates in excess of @xmath81 would be required in the shocked stellar wind scenario .",
    "the high required amounts of deposited material could not be provided by a sustained stellar wind since the wind would interact with the ambient ism at these large radii ( @xmath84  cm ) from the site of the explosion .",
    "instead , the x - ray emission from snrs is thought to originate in radiative cooling of the shock - heated ism which has substantially larger densities .",
    "the relatively low inferred mass - loss rate required to produce the observed x - ray luminosity of  indicates that the sn shock has not yet reached the ism .",
    "consequently , the  has not yet reached its snr phase .",
    "we therefore conclude that at an age of 35  years ,  is the oldest sn observed in x - rays , and provides important constraint as to when the transition from a sn to its snr phase occurs , which is likely at a later stage ( @xmath85100  years ) after its outburst .    in fig .",

    "2003 ) , and m33 ( ghavamian et  al .",
    "2005 ) snrs .",
    "a comparison of the x - ray luminosities shows that the transition from a sn to a snr appears to be rather smooth .",
    "if the evolution of  continues as observed to date , it will be similar to x - ray faint galactic snrs such as snrs 1181 and 1006 .",
    "x - ray bright sne such as sne 1978k and 1979c , which show no sign for an x - ray evolution out to large distances ( @xmath86  cm ) at an age of @xmath8  years after their outburst , can evolve into luminous snrs such as cas a due to their strong interaction with their dense ambient csm , or possibly attain the x - ray luminosities of the brightest snrs observed ( such as w49b or n132d ) in case of a dense ism interaction .",
    "clearly , x - ray detections and monitoring of intermediate - age ( around 100  years ) sne are needed to address these questions and to study the transition from a sn into a snr in detail .",
