    "topological quantum computation ( tqc ) describes the general idea of storing and processing quantum information in topological states of matter.@xcite the most appealing aspects of tqc reside in the intrinsic protection of the ground - state subspace against local ( static ) perturbations ; topological ground states are thus viewed as a good place to hide quantum information .",
    "furthermore , quantum gates are executed by performing highly non - local operations that consist in the exchange ( or braiding ) of quasi - particles in the form of non - abelian anyons .",
    "while it is difficult for the environment to induce such exchanges , an external observer is able to do it by adiabatically controlling the parameters of the system .",
    "also , the applied quantum gates depend only on the _ topology _ of the exchange and are thus insensitive to local imperfections .    in the last decade",
    ", it has appeared that ising anyons are the non - abelian particles most likely to occur in physical systems in the laboratory , see ref .   and references therein .",
    "although their braiding statistics is not rich enough to generate a universal set of gates , they allow the implementation of the clifford group in a topologically protected fashion and are thus of strong interest for quantum computation . in this context , the so - called kitaev wire @xcite has recently attracted tremendous attention .",
    "in fact , unpaired majorana modes appear in this model and , when braided in a network of one - dimensional wires , they behave as ising anyons .",
    "@xcite considerable theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite efforts have been invested to investigate semiconducting hybrid structures that could realize the kitaev wire .",
    "although majorana qubits exhibit many favorable properties , more and more studies have focused on the fragility of such topological qubits . in particular ,",
    "several sources of noise that limit the applicability of such setups have been reported .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we start from a microscopic model and study the lifetime of the majorana code , see refs .  , as well as sec .",
    "[ sec : ecec ] for a definition , when coupled to a _ parity - preserving _ thermal environment .",
    "we apply the davies prescription to derive a born - markov master equation .",
    "we first focus on a single wire with immobile majorana bound states ( mbss ) and discuss how to perform error correction to counteract the effect of the environment .",
    "we demonstrate in the high - temperature limit , both analytically and with monte carlo methods , that the lifetime grows logarithmically with the system size .",
    "this result is not unexpected as similar behavior was observed by bravyi and koenig for a closed system with hamiltonian perturbations.@xcite as a next step , we study a trijunction with moving mbss .",
    "our main result is the investigation of details of _ dangerous _ error processes that prevent the lifetime of the system from increasing with the system size .",
    "the origin of dangerous errors is the braiding itself that renders a local error source highly non local by dragging excitations across the trijunction . in particular , we demonstrate that performing error correction at the end of the braid does not allow the dangerous errors to be cured .",
    "we confirm our predictions with a monte carlo simulation .",
    "our work is an extension of ref .  . here",
    ", we present additional physical results as well as the technical details leading to the main results of ref .  .",
    "in the context of a full quantum computing protocol , where several braids are executed , our results imply that error correction at the end of all the braids , i.e. purely passive , is not enough .",
    "our results show also that a more active scheme , in which error correction is executed at the end of each braid , is also too weak to solve the problem of dangerous errors .",
    "we are led to the view that error correction will only be successful if it is fully active , i.e. , where several error correction steps are executed during each braid , to counteract the decoherence effects of dangerous errors .",
    "therefore , our work brings additional evidence that even in non - abelian topological codes active error correction , in the same sense as for ordinary quantum error correction codes , is necessary .",

    "in this work we have investigated the self - correcting properties of majorana 1d quantum computing architectures .",
    "in particular , starting from a microscopic model , we focused on the situation where mbss are braided in a trijunction setup coupled to a parity - preserving bosonic environment .",
    "while a single wire with immobile mbss represents a truly self - correcting quantum memory with a lifetime that increases with the size of the wire , this is not true anymore when mbss are exchanged in a trijunction architecture .",
    "the main reason is the occurrence of so - called dangerous errors that are solely due to the motion of mbss ; an mbs can trap an excitation and drag it along during braiding , thus rendering a local source of noise highly nonlocal in its effect . in this case ,",
    "error correction at the end of the braid is insufficient to recover the stored quantum information .    in the context of a full quantum computing protocol , where several braids are executed ,",
    "our results imply that passive error correction ( at the end of all braids ) and even active error correction , in which correction is performed at the end of each braid , is too weak to counteract the negative effects of dangerous errors .",
    "the only possibility we envision to preserve the stored quantum information is to perform repeatedly error correction _ during _ each braid : in the very simple example of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1_2 ] , performing error correction both at stages @xmath155 and @xmath237 would allow successful recovery of the logical qubit .",
    "our results are in agreement with the more and more popular view that active error correction is necessary even in non - abelian topological systems .",
    "@xcite in light of this discussion , we point out that increasing @xmath0 , far from improving the lifetime of the trijunction logical qubit , actually makes the situation worse because the time to braid mbss adiabatically is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    we also comment that while our results put restrictions on the self - correcting properties of this specific quantum computing architecture , one can expect other schemes , such as interaction - based braiding of mbss , @xcite to behave in a more favorable way .",
    "finally , it is a priori not clear whether braiding mbss in 2d systems suffers from the same restrictions as the 1d case studied here . in 2d setups ,",
    "the paths followed by the braided mbss must cross at least once , but do not need to overlap over a large region .",
    "therefore , dangerous error processes should occur less frequently than in 1d implementations ; but we keep in mind that a single uncorrectable error is enough to prevent the lifetime of the topological qubit from increasing with the system size .",
