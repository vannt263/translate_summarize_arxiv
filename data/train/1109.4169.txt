    "the halo model of galaxy clustering ( see cooray and sheth 2002 for a review ) takes as one of its usual assumptions that the clustering of a dark matter halo is dictated solely by its mass .",
    "observationally when looking at a cluster or group it is easiest to count galaxies ( see e.g. , hao 2010 , yang 2005 , for recent cluster and group catalogues ) , which are usually associated with the population of dark matter subhalos .",
    "the role that the number of subhalos plays in the clustering of halos and also how that number is affected by environment has the potential to be linked directly with observations .",
    "if halo mass and number of subhalos affect clustering independently then this is a challenge to a main assumption of the halo model . in this paper",
    "we examine the role of the number of subhalos in a halo on clustering in two different ways , first by studing the environments ( nearby overdensity ) of halos and second by computing the correlation function .",
    "gao , springel and white ( 2005 ) showed that the clustering strength of dark matter halos depends not only on mass but also on formation time .",
    "this result used a high resolution large volume simulation ( the millennium simulation of springel 2005 ) and was the first of a set of results showing that halo mass is only the first order driver of halo clustering .",
    "subsequent studies confirmed the result ( e.g. , zhu 2006 , harker 2006 ) and showed that other dependencies exist apart from halo mass , such as concentration ( e.g. , wechsler 2006 , hereafter w06 ) , and halo spin and shape ( bett 2007 ) .",
    "w06 also found a dependence on number of subhalos , and gao and white ( 2007 ) ( hereafter gw07 ) on the substructure fraction , both at fixed mass in that halos with more substructure are more clustered .",
    "it is these relationships that we will be investigating in more detail in this paper .",
    "the clustering of halos can be probed in a different , related fashion by measuring properties of the local environment . again in this case to first order the dependence of halo properties on environment was shown to be limited to mass by lemson & kaufmann ( 1999 ) .",
    "advances in simulation size and resolution enabled this type of analysis to be extended to measure smaller effects and different statistics .",
    "for example , the abundance of halo substructure in a high resolution simulation of side length @xmath4 was shown by ishiyama ( 2008 ) to be dependent on local overdensity .",
    "wang ( 2011 ) find that the large - scale tidal field significantly affects all halo properties they studied ( assembly time , spin , shape and substructure ) at fixed mass .",
    "white ( 2010 ) , concentrating on cluster - sized halos show that their environment influences and causes physical correlations in many observational probes of mass and richness ( e.g. , subhalo number , lensing and velocity dispersion ) .",
    "the analysis in this paper is an extension of some of this prior work , which has already shown in many ways that the subtleties of halo clustering are not explained by the simplest forms of the halo model .",
    "here we use the language of the halo occupation distribution ( hod , berlind & weinberg 2002 ) to examine the environmental dependence of substructure . in looking at clustering , we examine samples of halos from the point of view of their bivariate distribution ( mass and number of subhalos ) , which it turns out can lead to some interesting behaviours which may suggest further improvements in the halo model .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the n - body simulation we use to study the subhalo population of halos along with their large - scale enviroment .",
    "we give our measures of environment and describe our method for computing statistics that depend on halo occupation at fixed halo mass .",
    "the environmental dependence of the hod is examined in section 3 and a resolution test is carried out . in section 4",
    "we examine the clustering of halos , measuring their large - scale bias as a function of mass and subhalo occupation . in section 5",
    "we summarize our results and discuss their implications for both the theoretical halo model and observational probes of dark matter halos .",
    "we have used p - gadget , an upgraded version of gadget3 ( see springel 2005 for details of an earlier code version ) which is being developed for upcoming petascale supercomputer facilities , to run a large dark matter simulation of a @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "the cosmological parameters used were : amplitude of mass fluctuations , @xmath5 , spectra index , @xmath6 , cosmological constant parameter @xmath7 , and mass density parameter @xmath8 . in the present work we use the simulation output at @xmath1 , the same as that analyzed in our previous paper using that simulation ( khandai 2011 ) .",
    "the initial conditions were generated with the eisenstein and hu ( 1998 ) power spectrum at an initial redshift of z = 159 .",
    "the basic simulation parameters are : box side length , 400 @xmath9 , the number of particles , @xmath10 , the mass of a particle , @xmath11 and the gravitational softening length , @xmath12 . for reference ,",
    "our simulation volume is roughly half that of the millennium simulation ( springel 2005 ) but our mass resolution is about a factor of three better .",
    "halos and subhalos are identified on the fly as the simulation runs , the halos using a standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) groupfinder with linking length 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation .",
    "the halo masses quoted are the sum of masses of all particles in the fof group .",
    "we use the subfind code ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) to construct a subhalo catalogue and to measure the mass for every subhalo .",
    "groups of particles are retained as a subhalo when they have at least 20 bound particles , which corresponds to a minimum group mass of @xmath13 = @xmath14 .",
    "we will investigate the dependence of our results on the minimum cutoff mass in the halo and subhalo masses .",
    "we also carry out a resolution test in section 3.2    the number of fof halos in our simulation with mass greater than @xmath15 is 15.3 million .",
    "these fof halos contain a total of 18.6 million subhalos ( we do not differentiate between central and satellite subhalos ) .",
    "several of the trends we will be looking at are relatively subtle and the statistical power coming from the large number of subhalos and halos is needed to make them readily detectable .",
    "we note that other authors have investigated the dependence of substructure on other halo properties ( e.g. , jeeson - daniel 2011 , skibba & maccio 2011 ) and clustering on substructure ( e.g. , gw07 , wang 2011 ) .",
    "substructure can be defined in many different ways ( such as the mass fraction in subhalos above a certain mass ) and also be counted either within the fof halo or within a certain radius ( gw07 try @xmath16 ) .",
    "we use the definition of substructure appropriate to the usual definition of the hod , the number of subhalos above a certain mass within the fof halo .",
    "we expect ( as shown by gw07 and bett 2007 ) that the complex nature of the relationship between detailed halo properties and clustering will mean that different definitions of substructure can yield different results .      as a measure of environment",
    "we have a number of choices .",
    "the most standard is the overdensity within a sphere of fixed radius .",
    "we take this , using a fixed radius of @xmath17 comoving to be our fiducial measure .",
    "we also test other radii , as well as using instead the overdensity in the sphere centered on a halo that encloses a fixed mass @xmath18 .",
    "this lagrangian definition of overdensity has been used before in the context of simulations by for example colberg & di matteo ( 2008 ) , who investigated the relationship between supermassive blackholes and their environments .",
    "we note that the overdensity within either a fixed radius or lagrangian volume is expected to correlate strongly with halo mass ( see for example the extensive study carried out by haas 2011 ) .",
    "haas 2011 show that it is possible to formulate measures of environment that are independent of halo mass .",
    "in the present paper we have the more limited goal of investigating the dependence of number of subhalos ( rather than mass ) on environment .",
    "we can sidestep the mass - environment correlation by either plotting a statistic we are interested in as a function of halo mass directly ( the hod ) for different environments , or else by plotting a statistic ( the correlation function and its relative bias ) as a function of number of subhalos for fixed mass . either way we have removed the dependence on mass for the purposes of our analysis .",
    "once we have a halo catalogue and have enumerated the subhalos per halo , we would like to break up our full sample into high and low occupation halos , where `` occupation '' is simply the number of subhalos ( we do not differentiate between central subhalos or satellites ) .    in order to avoid dependence of properties ( such as clustering ) on halo mass , we would like to somehow make the sample be effectively at fixed halo mass .",
    "one possible approach involves applying an upper and lower mass threshold to the halo sample and then ordering the remaining halos by occupation .",
    "there are two disadvantages with this .",
    "first , applying mass cuts in this way will reduce the number of halos available for study , perhaps dramatically if the mass window allowed is narrow .",
    "second , if the mass window is not very narrow one could legitimately worry that dependence on halo mass will still creep in , as there is obviously a strong dependence of halo occupation and halo mass .",
    "this means that for such a mass window , the top say 10% of halos by occupation could be significantly more massive than the bottom 10% .",
    "we avoid both of these problems by instead breaking our full halo sample into a large number of narrow bins in mass . in each one of the mass bins , we order the halos by occupation number per unit mass , choosing the top 5% of halos , top 10 % and so on . when making a sample of halos chosen by occupation we then take the required fraction from each mass bin , so that we are left with a sample that spans the entire mass range , but that was chosen by occupation at fixed halo mass .",
    "we have tried varying the width of the mass bins , @xmath19 , finding that below @xmath20 our results are independent of its value ( we use @xmath21 ) .",
    "we make first use of our set of halos ranked by occupation at fixed halo mass in section 2.4 below when plotting their spatial distribution . the main use for",
    "this type of subsample will however be in section 4 when we examine clustering .",
    "it will be useful to us to also look at halos ranked by mass for a fixed number of subhalos .",
    "in this case we will use the same technique , breaking the sample into a large number of narrow bins , but this time in subhalo number .      as an example of our categorization of halos by occupation we show in figure [ slice ] the spatial distribution of high and low occupation halos . here",
    "high occupation halos are the top 5% by number of subhalos per unit mass at fixed mass , using the definition given above ( section 2.3 ) , and the low occupation are the bottom 5 % . for reference ,",
    "the mean number of subhalos in the high occupation sample is 17.6 and the mean mass per halo is @xmath22 .",
    "the mean number of subhalos for the bottom 5% sample is 4.1 and the mean mass per halo is @xmath23 .    looking at figure [ slice ]",
    "we can immediately see that there is a difference in the way the two subsamples are tracing out structures .",
    "lower occupation halos appear to outnumber the high occupation halos in the low density regions that fill most of space . in the densest areas ,",
    "there are many more high occupation halos .",
    "we will see in the following sections 3.1 and 3.3 that this is borne out quantitatively by considering the halo occupation distribution in different density environments and also measuring the correlation function for the two samples we are plotting here .",
    "many observational measurements of galaxy clustering can be reproduced by theories that include two main ingredients , the clustering of dark matter halos , and a model for the number of galaxies in a halo .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod , see e.g. berlind & weinberg 2002 , zheng 2002 , kravtsov 2004 ) is a way of formulating the latter . in the case were galaxies are identified with dark matter subhalos , the hod can be measured from a simulation by simply counting the number of subhalos as a function of halo mass . in the present paper",
    "we will only concern ourselves with the mean number of galaxies in a halo , leaving the form of the probability distribution for further work .",
    "we note that boylan - kolchin ( 2010 ) have found that subhalo abundances are not well described by poisson statistics at low mass , but rather are dominated by intrinsic scatter .",
    "the simplest assumption that can be made about the hod is that the mean number of subhalos , @xmath24 depends only on halo mass .",
    "this assumption has been shown to hold relatively well by berlind ( 2003 ) in ( hydrodynamic ) simulations and is consistent with the e.g. , yang ( 2005 ) observational measurements of galaxy groups .",
    "it is known however that substructure fraction does depend on environments in simulations ( e.g. , wang 2011 ) .",
    "we will see how this translates into changes in the hod , first by looking at the local overdensity around halos and then some other measures of the environment .",
    "we measure the density within a radius of each halo center of mass .",
    "we then rank the halos by density and plot the hod for the halos as a function of halo mass for different density subsamples .",
    "results are shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ hod ] , where we show the hod for the top 5% by density , bottom 5% by density and for the whole sample . in the top panels of that figure we show the fractional difference from the hod for the whole sample for the two extreme density bins . to compute the error bars on the fractional difference",
    ", the volume was split into octants , and a jacknife estimator ( bradley 1982 ) was used to compute the error on the mean from the standard deviation of the jacknife subsamples .",
    "we can see from figure [ hod](a ) that the number of subhalos in a halo does depend on the local density , with the halos located in the densest ( @xmath2 ) of environments having a peak difference in halo occupation of @xmath25 more subhalos than the set of all halos .",
    "this difference is most prominent for halos of masses @xmath26 and becomes zero at lower and higher halo mass .",
    "the difference is even larger for halos in underdense regions , which have less subhalos than the set of all halos by up to @xmath27 , a result which again depends on halo mass .",
    "looking at more extreme ends of the @xmath24 distribution , the peak shifts to the right ( e.g. , @xmath28 for the top @xmath29 by occupation .",
    "the environmental dependence continues out to larger radius , as can be see in figure [ hod](b ) where we use density measured with @xmath30 to rank halos .",
    "a third method to measure the density is that within a lagrangian volume with mass @xmath31 .",
    "this is shown in panel ( c ) , where the sign of the effect is the same , although the amplitude for the low density environments is very different ( and therefore the effect is detected at a lower level of significance ) .",
    "this is likely to do with the fact that the lowest density environments in this lagrangian picture are being measured out to very large radii and therefore diluting the effect .",
    "for example , the mean radius that encloses @xmath31 for the `` bottom 1% '' line is @xmath32 .",
    "the dependence of halo properties on environment has been investigated by many authors ( e.g. , ishiyama 2008 , wang 2011 ) . recently",
    "jeeson - daniel ( 2011 ) have shown that environment does not correlate with substructure mass fraction on a halo by halo basis .",
    "this appears to be at odds with what we find here , but the definition of environment used by jeeson - daniel ( 2011 ) is different to ours , being chosen so that it is not dependent on halo mass .",
    "also we count subhalos by number and not by mass fraction .",
    "wang ( 2011 ) on the other hand have found a relationship between local tidal field of a halo and substructure .",
    "jeeson - daniel and skibba ( 2011 ) find that concentration ( closely related to age ) is more fundamental in setting a range of halo properties than mass .",
    "the destruction of substructure over time in halos can explain the anticorrelation between age or concentration and substructure ( gao 2004 ) .",
    "one might therefore expect there to be less substructure in halos which formed earlier , and have a higher concentration .",
    "our results could be explained therefore if halos in higher density regions had later formation times and lower concentrations , but this is not the case in general ( as pointed out by w06 and gw07 ) , so that the situation is more complex . in w06 and wetzel ( 2007 )",
    "it was shown that low concentration halos and late forming halos do preferentially reside in high density environments , but only provided the halo masses are @xmath33 .",
    "zentner ( 2007 ) pointed out that is the general dependence that would be expected from an excursion set theory analysis ( see also further work by dalal 2008 ) .",
    "these papers argued that high - concentration and early - forming halos are found in high density environments when @xmath34 because these halos have their growth quenched by the tidal fields of nearby large halos . at @xmath1 , @xmath35 so this effect is more relevant than at @xmath36 where almost all halos of interest have @xmath33 .",
    "gioccoli ( 2010 ) have plotted the hod for halos identified at different redshifts , finding a systematic shift over all masses to more subhalos at higher redshifts ( and higher concentration ) , which is consistent with the interpretation of our finding above ( see also kravtsov 2004 , and zentner 2005 ) .",
    "we do however only find a difference in hod over a limited range of masses , so that other effects are involved as well .",
    "one thing which is clear is that the halo model of galaxy clustering which assumes a fixed hod for all enviroments can be wrong at up to the @xmath37 level in the least dense environments .",
    "how this dependence of hod on environment affects statistics that are measured , such as the correlation function of galaxies is best addressed by computing them directly , which we do in section 4 .",
    "our minimum mass to be counted as a subhalo is @xmath38 ( 20 particles ) . in figure [ hod2 ]",
    "we show the effect on the environmental dependence ( defined as density within 5 @xmath9 ) of the hod on changes in this parameter . in panels ( a)-(c )",
    "we are varying the subhalo mass threshold by factors of 3,4 and 16 .",
    "the number of subhalos at fixed mass obviously decreases sharply as the subhalo mass threshold is raised .",
    "we however do not see any noticeable change in the difference between subhalo number in low and high density environments .",
    "this is interesting as one may have thought that small mass halos would be more susceptible to destruction and so there should be more of an effect .",
    "this also does not appear to be a resolution effect ( we return to this below ) .",
    "in both figure [ hod ] and figure [ hod2 ] we can see that the environmental dependence of the hod appears to be much smaller , or go away completely for very high mass host halos ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "this appears to be in accord with zentner ( 2005 ) and w06 , who found that for low occupation number halos the environmental trends are those induced by formation time ( because for small halos the abundance of subhalos reveals a lot about the mass accretion history of the host halo . ) for larger halos this relationship is not as strong and so one might expect the environmental trend to be less evident also .      as a test of the effect of resolution on our results",
    ", we have run a simulation with an identical cosmology but at worse mass resolution , and in a smaller volume .",
    "the simulation had @xmath40 particles in a box of side length @xmath41 , so that the mass per particle is 8 times larger than in our fiducial simulation ( the volume is also 14 times smaller ) .",
    "we again identified subhalos using subfind , and compared the hod in both simulations where the subhalo mass threshold was 40 particles in the low resolution run and 320 in the fiducial simulation ( the same mass in each ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ restest ] , where we show the fractional difference between mean number of subhalos for all halos and the top and bottom @xmath42 selected by mass , ( similar as in the top panels of figures [ hod ] and [ hod2 ] except here we show only the top and bottom quartiles because of the small number of halos in the low resolution simulation ) .",
    "we can see the pattern again , with more subhalos in denser regions and a rapid dropoff at high masses in the number of subhalos in underdense regions .",
    "there are not enough halos with masses above @xmath43 in the smaller , low resolution run to be able to compare results , but below that mass there does not appear to be any systematic difference between the @xmath24 values and those for our standard simulation . if numerical effects were responsible for the destruction of subhalos in high concentration regions one would expect there to be significantly different amounts of substructure . given that this does not occur despite the large difference in mass resolution is some evidence for the robustness of our results .",
    "although local overdensity is often used interchangeably with environment , other local measures of the environment of halos have been shown to affect halo properties .",
    "for example ,",
    "wang ( 2011 ) find that at fixed halo mass , halo properties depend strongly on the local tidal field . the substructure mass fraction in their simulations is particularly affected , although the nature of the dependence is complex .",
    "they suggest that halos in higher density ( and higher tidal field regions ) have more accretion and so more substructure .",
    "we investigate three measures of local environment apart from the density and look at their effect on the hod .",
    "again we use a fixed radius of @xmath17 to define the local region around each halo .",
    "we look at the asymmetry of the local mass distribution ( defined as the offset of the center of mass and the center of the halo , divided by @xmath17 ) , the mean infall velocity of particles , and the mean angular momentum . of these",
    ", the asymmetry has some similarities with the tidal field studied by wang ( 2011 ) , and the infall velocity will be strongly related to the overdensity .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ hod3 ] , where we again plot the hod for the top and bottom @xmath2 of halos chosen according to each statistic . again",
    "our fiducial cutoff in subhalo mass is @xmath44 .",
    "we compute the mean ( mass - weighted ) infall velocity by summing the mass times the component of the velocity of each particle in the radial direction ( towards the center of the halo ) and then dividing by the total mass of particles within the ( @xmath17 ) radius .",
    "as expected , the high mean infall velocity selected halos ( middle panel ) show the same sign of effect in overabundance of subhalos as seen in highly overdense regions .",
    "the size of the positive effect is again close to a maximum @xmath45 difference from all halos .",
    "the negative effect , in halos of low infall velocity is about a maximum of @xmath46 below the result for all halos , somewhat less than the equivalent result for density ( left panel of figure [ hod ] .",
    "the asymmetry results are more instructive , with the most asymmetric local regions having fewer subhalos ( by @xmath47 ) than all halos , and the least asymmetric @xmath47 more . that this is a separate effect to the density effect which can be understood by the fact that the most asymmetric regions actually have higher densities ( because they have more neighbouring halos ) .",
    "looking at the relationship between density and asymmetry ( not plotted ) we find for the mean asymmetry , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the density within @xmath17 .",
    "we also find that the mean value of the density @xmath49 , for the halos with the top @xmath2 of asymmetry @xmath50 values is the same as for the top @xmath51 of halos ranked by density @xmath49 .",
    "if increased local density is causing the trend , one should therefore expect ( based on figure 2 ) to find a @xmath45 increase in the number of subhalos in the most asymmetric regions , rather than a @xmath52 decrease .",
    "there appears to be little dependence of halo substructure on angular momentum of the surrounding region ( 3rd panel ) , although the error bars are large .",
    "given that the environment on at least 5 @xmath9 and 10 @xmath9 scales noticeably affects the number of subhalos in a halo at fixed mass , a natural progression is a study of the clustering properties of halos .",
    "as described in section 2.3 we have constructed samples of halos with varying numbers of subhalos and fixed halo mass , as well as samples of fixed mean halo occupation but varying mass . in this section",
    "we will examine the clustering of these various samples .",
    "previous work on substructure and clustering includes that of w06 , who computed the mark correlation function of halos , with @xmath24 as the mark , and g07 who used substructure mass fraction as a defining variable for samples of halos ..      in figure [ xibias ] , we show the autocorrelation function @xmath53 of halos for three different mass thresholds , as a function of separation , @xmath54 . in each case , we have selected samples of fixed mean halo mass but with occupation in the top @xmath2 of halos , and bottom @xmath2 of halos . the results for the middle panel ( lower mass limit of @xmath55 ) therefore correspond to the halos plotted in figure [ slice ] .",
    "we can see that in each panel the autocorrelation function of the high occupation halos is significantly enhanced with respect to that of all halos ( also shown ) .",
    "the low occupation halos , on the other hand have a slightly lower amplitude of clustering .",
    "we examine this relative bias in the top panels of figure [ xibias ] , where we plot the relative bias with respect to all halos , as a function of scale , e.g. for high occupation halos ,    @xmath56    we can see in figure [ xibias ] that the relative bias is close to flat as a function of @xmath54 for low occupation halos , and for high occupation it is flat on large scales , @xmath57 for all mass bins .",
    "the effect of high occupation is more pronounced for halos of larger mass , with the @xmath58 halos having a relative bias @xmath59 on large scales ( an amplitude of @xmath60 twice that of all halos , and the low mass cutoff halos @xmath61 having @xmath62 on these scales .    just as we expected from the plot of halo positions",
    ", there is a substantial clustering difference between halos of different occupation at fixed mass .",
    "how exactly this bias is related to halo occupation and mass can be examined by working with measurements of the large scale ( flat part ) of the bias directly , which we do below .      because a focus of this paper is on the link between clustering and halo occupation and mass",
    "we compute bias for a grid of values of these two parameters . to measure the large - scale bias @xmath63 between halos and dark matter we use @xmath53 data",
    "points with @xmath64 .",
    "we describe our jacknife estimator for computing the error on @xmath63 below . in figure [ biasgrid ]",
    "we show results for @xmath63 on a colour scale , as a function of halo mass and subhalo number along the two axes .",
    "the plane of the figure is not filled , but the relatively large scatter about the mean relation between @xmath24 and halo mass means that there is data for a substantial fraction of parameter space that lies off this relation .",
    "for example , at low mass and low @xmath24 there are @xmath55 halos with only 1 subhalo of mass greater than our threshold ( @xmath44 ) , as well as some halos of similar mass but with @xmath24 a factor of 15 larger .",
    "the most obvious trend in the @xmath63 values shown in the plot is the increase in @xmath63 along the mean relation between @xmath24 and @xmath65 .",
    "halos of larger mass tend to cluster more and also on average tend to have more subhalos .",
    "it is also clear at low masses and low subhalo numbers that increasing halo mass but keeping @xmath24 fixed ( moving along rows from left to right ) yields an increasing @xmath63 , as does increasing @xmath24 but keeping @xmath65 fixed ( moving up columns ) .",
    "it is interesting that from this it appears that @xmath24 and @xmath65 independently control the amplitude of clustering .",
    "this holds in the bottom left of the plot , but when one moves to the top right a trend along rows or up columns is harder to see . by using an averaging technique ( section 4.3 see below )",
    "we will see that it turns out that at high occupation , @xmath63 is completely independent of @xmath65 , ( no trend along rows in figure [ biasgrid ] ) whereas at high masses , @xmath63 is still correlated with @xmath24 ( still a trend up columns , at least for the mass range shown ) .    before examining these trends in @xmath63 as a function of halo occupation at fixed mass , we will explore the variation of @xmath63 with halo mass and @xmath24 . the steepness of these trends will allow us to place our later results in context . that halo bias is strongly influenced by halo mass is a result that is at the heart of many analyses of large scale stucture ( e.g. , kaiser 1984 , mo & white 1996 , seljak & warren 2004 ) in figure [ biassubandmass ] we show @xmath63 ( in this case the bias of halos with respect to the dark matter distribution ) plotted against mean halo mass in various mass bins , finding qualitatively the same steep relationship seen in e.g. , figure 8 of seljak and warren ( 2004 ) .",
    "we also plot @xmath63 against the mean number of subhalos in a halo , finding a steeper relationship ( in that @xmath63 increases faster for a given increase in @xmath66 ) . because @xmath24 increases",
    "more slowly than @xmath65 as @xmath65 is increased ( see e.g. , figure [ hod ] ) this behaviour is expected .",
    "we show @xmath63 as a function of @xmath24 for two different subhalo mass thresholds , finding that @xmath63 increases faster for a higher threshold mass .",
    "this again is expected as for higher mass thresholds the hod curves stay longer on the shallower initial part of the @xmath67 relationship ( see e.g. , figure [ hod2 ] ) .",
    "we take samples of halos which are chosen to either have fixed halo mass or fixed number of subhalos ( as defined in section 2.3 ) , and compute how the large scale bias @xmath68 changes as we vary the other parameter .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ bias1 ] , where on the @xmath69axis we show the percentiles of the distribution .",
    "for example in the top panel a point at @xmath70 shows @xmath68 for the top @xmath29 of halos by occupation , at fixed halo mass .",
    "likewise a point at @xmath71 shows @xmath68 for the bottom @xmath29 of halos by occupation , at @xmath72 for the bottom @xmath73 and so on .",
    "points at @xmath74 show results for all halos in that halo mass bin , and the bias @xmath68 is measured relative to this ( as in equation 1 ) .",
    "this is different from @xmath63 computed with respect to the dark matter distribution , and ensures that all curves pass through @xmath75 at @xmath74 .    in the top panel of figure [ bias1 ] , the values of @xmath68",
    "are shown for variations in the @xmath24 percentile , at fixed halo mass .",
    "we show results for two different halo masses , and two different cutoffs in the mass of a subhalos .",
    "the mean halo mass @xmath76 shown in the figure caption for the curves was computed by averaging over the masses of halos above a mass threshold . as required ,",
    "the @xmath76 are approximately constant for the different bins of @xmath24 percentile , and in all cases within @xmath45 of the @xmath76 value given .",
    "we can see that @xmath68 does change significantly with @xmath24 percentile , even though the mean halo mass is the same for all points along the curve .",
    "this is what we expect from looking at figures [ slice ] and [ xibias ] .",
    "we can also see that the steepest change in @xmath63 occurs for the larger mass halos .",
    "this analysis is equivalent to adding together the trend in @xmath63 that one gets by moving up different columns in figure [ biasgrid ] .",
    "if we now turn to the results showing how @xmath63 varies as @xmath65 is changed for fixed @xmath24 ( bottom panel of figure [ bias1 ] ) , we can see that the situation is somewhat different . in this plot ,",
    "the @xmath77 values shown are computed from the average number of subhalos above a threshold in @xmath24 , for each of the bins of @xmath65 percentile . here",
    "we see that for a low number of subhalos , @xmath78 , there is a strong trend of @xmath63 with halo mass , one which is strong for both values of subhalo mass cutoff .",
    "however when we increase the @xmath24 threshold to give a higher value of @xmath79 , we find that there is no dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath65 percentile .",
    "this independence of halo clustering and halo mass is interesting enough that we revisit it in figure [ bias2 ] . where we now turn to plotting @xmath63 with respect to dark matter halo clustering .",
    "the scale of the effects can then be judged compared to the overall trend of clustering increasing with greater halo mass and with greater @xmath24 .    in order to judge the significance of the comparison , it is useful to put error bars on the points .",
    "we have done this by first splitting the simulation into octants and using a jackknife estimator . using random catalogs",
    "we have computed @xmath53 for the halo subsamples and for the dark matter particles , for the simulation volume minus each octant in turn .",
    "the value of @xmath63 was computed for each jackknife subsample , with the error bar coming from their standard deviation .    in figure",
    "[ bias2 ] , as in figure [ bias1 ] , the top panel shows @xmath63 as a function of @xmath24 for fixed halo mass , and the bottom panel show @xmath63 as a function of @xmath65 for fixed @xmath24 .",
    "we show results for 4 different halo masses in the top panel , and the @xmath69axis is @xmath24 instead of @xmath24 percentile .",
    "we can see that even for @xmath80 there is a trend of increasing @xmath63 with increasing @xmath24 . as in figure",
    "[ bias1 ] , for the smallest @xmath24 we notice that there is some flattening and even a small increase in @xmath63 . for larger @xmath24",
    "the curves for varying @xmath24 at fixed halo mass appear to track the black line relatively well , which shows how @xmath63 varies with @xmath24 for all halos .",
    "in the bottom panel , the results for fixed @xmath24 show a different behaviour .",
    "we see that for a sample with @xmath24 threshold of 4 subhalos ( with mass @xmath81 ) there is no dependence of @xmath63 on halo mass . to show how different this behaviour is from that usually seen in the halo mass - bias relation ( e.g. , seljak & warren 2004 )",
    "we can compare to the black line in the bottom panel of figure [ bias2 ] which shows how @xmath63 varies as a function of halo mass for all halos .",
    "the relative change in @xmath63 for all halos is substantial ( a change of @xmath82 ) over the mass range that is probed by the blue line ( where there is no change in @xmath63 ) .",
    "the behaviour of this relationship is examined for larger halos in figure [ largehalos ] .",
    "we show the same bias versus mass plot as in the bottom panel of figure [ bias2 ] , but this time for halos with a lower limit on @xmath24 varying from 10 to 100 .",
    "we can see that for fixed subhalo number , the lack of dependence of bias on halo mass seen in figure [ bias2 ] gradually turns into a strong anticorrelation of bias on halo mass .",
    "this happens between a threshold of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , halos which have masses of @xmath85 and above .",
    "we have seen earlier ( figure [ hod ] ) that the environmental dependence of the hod declines for halos larger than @xmath85 . from our clustering results ( figure [ largehalos ] )",
    "one might perhaps have expected a negative environmental dependence which is not seen in figure [ hod ] .",
    "the situation is undoubtedly complex .",
    "using a large , high resolution dark matter simulation output at redshift @xmath1 , we have investigated the role that the environment of halos plays on the number of subhalos they host , and we examined the relationship between clustering and subhalo number .",
    "we find that    \\(1 ) at fixed halo mass , the number of subhalos in a halo is affected by local density , with overdense regions having more substructures over the whole range of halo masses , and underdense regions having less .",
    "this effect can be as large as @xmath86 for the most underdense @xmath2 of regions .",
    "\\(2 ) our finding ( 1 ) is not significantly affected by the mass limit applied to subhalos , or ( in a resolution test ) by simulation resolution .",
    "\\(3 ) at a much smaller level , the asymmetry of the local density ( quantified by a centroid shift ) affects the subhalo number , so that the most asymmetric halos have fewer subhalos , at the percent level .",
    "\\(4 ) the clustering of halos at fixed mass is strongly affected by the number of subhalos .",
    "this is true over the entire mass range tested , from @xmath87 and for different values of subhalo mass cutoff . as with prior examples of the dependence on clustering of variables other than mass ( e.g. age , gao 2005 , concentration , w06 ) , it is thus straightforward to generate samples of halos which have the same mass but widely different clustering properties .",
    "\\(5 ) the clustering of halos at fixed number of subhalos is only positively dependent on mass for small halos .",
    "as we increase the size of halos , we find that for halos with more than 4 subhalos ( for a subhalo mass limit of @xmath88 ) , at fixed number of subhalos there is no dependence of clustering strength on halo mass , and then for larger halos , of group and cluster size , we find that this turns into a strong anticorrelation of clustering amplitude and halo mass .",
    "this case , showing first an independence of clustering and halo mass and then an anticorrelation of the two is perhaps the bluntest expression yet of the shortcomings of the standard halo model when dealing with the subtleties of galaxy clustering .",
    "the most widely used version of halo model of galaxy clustering has at its heart some very simple premises .",
    "it is already well known however from simulation studies that many parameters apart from halo mass are actually at work in the translation of halo clustering into galaxy clustering , including the formation time dependence of clustering ( gao 2005 ) , substructure dependence and concentration dependence ( w06 ) .",
    "looking for weak spots in the predictions of the halo model can in principle make the search for better models easier .",
    "it can also highlight areas in which for the present non - linear simulations can be a necessary tool in the attempt to make precise predictions of galaxy clustering .",
    "the areas we have investigated in this paper may have some observational consequences ( as we discuss below ) , but they also serve to highlight some special cases for which the halo model s prime assumptions are in direct contradiction with what is seen .",
    "these include a sample of halos of the same mass which have radically different clustering properties based on an internal property ( subhalo number ) as well as other samples of halos with very different masses but the same clustering amplitude .",
    "the environmental dependence of the hod is a relatively subtle effect , as can be seen by the fact that some previous smaller simulations ( e.g. berlind 2003 ) were consistent with no dependence .",
    "also , the observed correlation function of galaxies can be well modelled by an environmentally independent hod ( zehavi 2004 , zheng 2009 ) .",
    "there are however already signs that some observed galaxy statistics are not well predicted by the halo model , including higher order clustering of sdss galaxies in low density environments ( berrier 2011 ) .",
    "as future galaxy surveys move well past the million redshift regime ( e.g. , schlegel 2011 ) , we can ask however how well we need to know the hod and any extra environmentally dependent terms in order to carry out precision cosmology with an hod approach to galaxy clustering ( e.g. , zheng 2002 ) .",
    "further work is needed to determine the effect on for example the correlation function of including an environmental term in the hod .",
    "we have also not investigated in this paper the effect of environment on the distribution of the number of halos at fixed mass ( e.g. , kravtsov 2004 ) which may be strongly affected .",
    "it is also not clear how relevant and how strong the effects that we have seen here with dark matter simulations are on the galaxies that form within the subhalos .",
    "one can clearly enumerate many possible environmental effects that rely on baryonic physics ( e.g. , luminosities of backsplash galaxies , pimbblet 2011 , etc .. ) . which will further complicate the effect of environment on the hod , and which may even have the opposite sign .    the obvious example where the number of subhalos is used to define a set of objects are optical cluster catalogs .",
    "the environmental dependence of halo occupation is likely responsible for a fraction of the scatter in the mass - richness relation noted in optical cluster finders ( see e.g. rozo 2011 for different sources of scatter ) .",
    "the cause of the hod enviromental effect is a complex issue .",
    "it has been shown by many authors that a wide range of variables are affected by halo environment such as concentation ( e.g. wang 2011 ) .",
    "internal halo properties such as substructure and shape are nearly all correlated ( jeeson - daniel 2011 , skibba & maccio 2011 ) and the mass function of subhalos itself correlates with halo concentration , formation time etc ( gao 2011 ) .",
    "the relative importance of mergers and smooth accretion in building up the mass of halo ( wang 2011 ) is likely to play a role in the enviromental dependence of the hod .",
    "fakhouri and ma ( 2010 ) have shown that mergers dominate halo growth in overdense regions and diffuse accretion in voids .",
    "if they survive the merger and accretion process we therefore expect subhalos to be more numerous in overdense regions ( for halos of a given mass ) , as we have found ( see also wetzel 2007 ) .",
    "the destruction of subhalos over time by intrahalo merging and stripping will make this relationship even more diffcult to decipher .",
    "incorporating environmental dependences into the halo model , making it more complex , but able to deal with phenomena such as those that have been demonstrated here is one avenue which can be pursued .",
    "recently , gil - marin ( 2011 ) have presented some first steps in this direction .",
    "another source of potential uncertainty in the predictions of the halo model is the definition of halo mass .",
    "more ( 2011 ) have shown that the mass of a fof halo in a simulation depends on resolution .",
    "more state that the influence of substructures ( which depend on redshift and cosmology ) on the fof halo boundary , will make it difficult to model this effect in general . in our work ,",
    "the relationship between the number of substructures and environment is likely also influenced by the effect that substructures have on the mass definition .",
    "direct computation of the dependence of the correlation function of halos for different occupations shows more of the complex relationship between halo properties and clustering .",
    "the bias of halos of the same mass can vary widely depending on their occupation .",
    "for example ( from figure [ bias2 ] ) , the lowest @xmath42 of halos by occupation at fixed mass can have a bias which is @xmath89 lower than that for all halos .",
    "this is similar to the effect seen by gw07 based on substructure fraction within the fof group ( although not within @xmath16 ) and appears to be a stronger trend than that based on other properties at fixed mass , such as formation redshift ( gw05 ) , concentration ( w06 ) or spin ( gw07 ) .    in this paper",
    "we have focused on the clustering of halos of galaxy mass , and also only looked at @xmath1 .",
    "further work is needed to explore the relationship between clustering and halo occupation in cluster size halos and those at lower redshift .",
    "if the same relationships hold , then this could have interesting consequences for the clustering of galaxy clusters selected in optical surveys .",
    "one could make measurements of the dependence of galaxy cluster bias on mass ( measured using velocity dispersion or lensing mass ) and richness , equivalent to halo occupation .",
    "mapping out the bivariate distribution of bias values as in figure [ biasgrid ] would give further clues to the nature of galaxy formation in groups and clusters and how much it is affected by the non - baryonic processes investigated here .",
    "our final perhaps suprising finding is that one can easily select samples of halos ( by picking a fixed occupation ) for which there is either no dependence of clustering on mass or even a strong anticorrelation between the two .",
    "this finding is one which could also be tested with observational data on both mass and occupation .",
    "it again points to the complexity of halo clustering and the difficulties of using galaxy clustering measurements for precision cosmology .",
