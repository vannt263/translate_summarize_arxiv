    "it has been shown that the product and sum rules of both the bayesian probability and the bayesian information theories are derivable by way of consistency , @xcite ; the implication being that in our plausibility and relevancy judgments we humans have a preference for consistency , or , equivalently , rationality .",
    "moreover , knuth , a maxent - bayesian , is now researching if the very laws of physics may be derived by way of consistency constraints on lattices of events , @xcite .    in light of these exciting new developments , in both the fields of inference and physics , where consistency arguments are taking the stage by storm , and the fact that these authors , after two years of continuous research , have reached the point that they have come to trust their bayesian decision theory to almost the same extent as they have grown to trust the bayesian probability and information theories , these authors have come to entertain the notion that maybe their bayesian decision theory , which initially started as an intuitive enough bayesian alternative for the paradigm of behavioral economics , might actually be bayesian in the strictest sense of the word ; that is , an inescapable consequence of the desideratum of consistency .    in this fact sheet",
    "we will present the case , as it currently stands , for the bayesian decision theory , and which led us to this conjecture , together with the consistency proof of the bernoulli utility function , also known as the weber - fechner law of sense perception .",
    "the bayesian decision theory is very simple in structure .",
    "its algorithmic steps are the following :    1 .   use the product and sum rules of bayesian probability theory to construct outcome probability distributions .",
    "if our outcomes are monetary in nature , then by way of the bernoulli utility function we may map utilities to the monetary outcomes of our outcome probability distributions .",
    "maximize the sum of the lower and upper bounds of the resulting utility probability distributions .",
    "this , then , is the whole of the bayesian decision theory .",
    "in the bayesian decision theory each problem of choice is understood to consist of a set of decisions from which we must choose .",
    "each possible decision , when taken , has its own set of possible outcomes , and each outcome , for a given decision , has its own plausibility of occurring relative to the other outcomes under that same decision .",
    "so , each decision in our problem of choice admits its own outcome probability distribution .",
    "we will demonstrate in this section how to construct outcome probability distributions using the rules of bayesian probability theory . ] . in our hypothetical problem of choice ,",
    "the possible decisions @xmath0 , for @xmath1 , under consideration are whether or not to wear seat belts : @xmath2 the relevant events @xmath3 , for @xmath4 , when driving a car , as perceived by the decision maker , are @xmath5 the perceived outcomes @xmath6 , for @xmath7 , are @xmath8 for this particular case , the decisions taken do not modulate the probabilities of an event .",
    "so , we have that the probability for an event conditional on the decision taken is the same for both decisions , say : @xmath9 for @xmath1 . however , the conditional probability distributions of the outcomes given an event are modulated by the decision taken .",
    "we first consider the case where the decision maker is considering to wear seat belts , that is , @xmath10 .",
    "say , we have the following conditional probabilities : @xmath11 then by way of the product rule , @xcite , @xmath12 we may combine the probability of an event , , with the corresponding conditional probability distributions of some outcome given that event , , and obtain the probabilities of an event @xmath3 and an outcome @xmath6 given decision @xmath0 : @xmath13 we may present all these probabilities in a table and so get the corresponding bivariate probability distribution , table  [ tab : bidist1 ] .",
    ".bivariate event - outcome probability distribution for @xmath10 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in its most abstract form , we have that each problem of choice consists of a set of potential decisions @xmath14 each decision @xmath0 we make may give rise to a set of possible events @xmath15 these events @xmath16 are associated with the decisions @xmath0 by way of the conditional probabilities @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , each event @xmath16 allows for a set of potential outcomes @xmath18 these outcomes @xmath19 are associated with the events @xmath16 by way of the conditional probabilities @xmath20 .    by way of the product rule , ,",
    "we compute the bivariate probability distribution of an event and an outcome conditional on the decision taken : @xmath21 the outcome probability distribution is then obtained by marginalizing , , over all the possible events @xmath22 the outcome probability distributions , for @xmath23 , are the information carriers which represent our state of knowledge in regards to the consequences of our decisions .    at first sight the added event space in the abstract form given here may seem somewhat superfluous .",
    "but it was felt that further down the line , in decision theoretical problems more complex than the ones given in this fact sheet , this added space may help one in the construction of outcome probability distributions .",
    "the bernoulli utility function in the field of psycho - physics is called weber - fechner law . seeing that we will use in this section the psycho - physical point of view of money increments as a stimulus",
    ", we will refer in what follows to the bernoulli utility function as the weber - fechner law . but",
    "both names point to the same function and  [ bernoullib ] we , respectively , discuss the ubiquitousness of the bernoulli utility function , which has been derived several times over by different arguments , and proceed to give its corollary , the negative bernoulli utility function , which may be used to model the utility of debt . ] .",
    "the translation of monetary stimuli to utilities is analogous to the case where we are asked to translate loudness to a numerical value . according to weber - fechner law , postulated in the 19th century .",
    "] by the experimental psychologist fechner , intuitive human sensations tend to be logarithmic functions of the difference in stimulus , @xcite .",
    "so , we do not perceive stimuli in isolation , rather we perceive the relative change in stimuli , case in point being the decibel scale of sound .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be two stimuli which are to be compared . then the weber - fechner law tells us that the relative change ( rc ) is the difference of the logarithms of the stimuli : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is some scaling factor and @xmath28 some base of the logarithm . from , we have that if stimuli @xmath24 and @xmath25 are indistinguishable , that is , of the same strength , then their rc is 0 . if @xmath25 increases relative to @xmath24 , then @xmath29 . if @xmath25 decreases relative to @xmath24 , then @xmath30 .",
    "the weber - fechner law allows for one degree of freedom .",
    "this can be seen as follows . since @xmath31 we can rewrite as @xmath32 where @xmath33    let @xmath34 be an increment , either positive or negative , in a monetary stimulus @xmath35 .",
    "then we may define the utility of a monetary increment @xmath34 to be the perceived relative change in the initial wealth @xmath35 due to that increment @xmath34 , : @xmath36    if @xmath37 , then tells us that a loss of all one s initial wealth @xmath35 would have a utility of minus infinity .",
    "this is clearly not realistic .",
    "so , in order to model such a loss , we must introduce the threshold of income which is still significant @xmath38 , @xcite , where @xmath39 .",
    "the threshold of income has the following interpretation .    even for the homeless person there is some minimum amount of money that is still significant .",
    "this may be one dollar for a bag of potato chips , or three dollars for a packet of cigarettes .",
    "if the loss of money breaks through the limit of the minimum significant amount @xmath38 , the homeless person is left with an amount of money which , for all intents and purposes , is worthless . using the concept of the threshold of income , we may modify as @xmath40    if we want to give a graphical representation of , then the scaling constant @xmath41 , also known as the weber constant , must be set to some numerical value .",
    "say , we have a monthly expendable income of a thousand dollars , for groceries and the like , then introspection would suggest that a loss or gain of an amount less than ten dollars would not move us that much .",
    "so , @xmath42 constitutes a just noticeable difference , or , equivalently , 1 utile , for an initial wealth of @xmath43 , : @xmath44 if we then solve for the unknown weber constant @xmath41 , we find @xmath45 note that utiles represent the utility of the monetary outcomes , much like decibels represent the perceived intensity of sound . ] .",
    "suppose we have a student who has three hundred dollars per month to spend on groceries and the like and who stands to lose or to gain up to two hundred dollars .",
    "then , by way of and , we obtain the following mapping of monetary outcomes to utilities , figure  [ fig : p1.5.1 ] .        for the case of the rich man who has one million dollars to spend on groceries and the like and who stands stands to lose or to gain up to a hundred thousand dollars",
    ", we obtain the alternative mapping , figure  [ fig : p1.5.2 ] .        loss aversion is the phenomenon that losses may loom larger than gains , @xcite . comparing figures  [ fig : p1.5.1 ] and  [ fig : p1.5.2 ] ,",
    "we see that the weber - fechner law of experimental psychology , which is just bernoulli s utility function , captures both the loss aversion of the poor student , that is , asymmetry in gains and losses , as well as the linearity of the utility of relatively small gains and losses for the rich man .",
    "we will derive the bernoulli utility function , or , equivalently , the weber - fechner law , using the desiderata of invariance and consistency . in this",
    "we follow a venerable bayesian tradition , @xcite .",
    "say , we have the positive quantities @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 of some stimulus or commodity of interest . these quantities ,",
    "being numbers on the positive real and , consequently , transitive , admit an ordering .",
    "the quantities are assumed to be ordered as @xmath50 .",
    "we now want to find the function @xmath51 that quantifies the perceived decrease associated with going from , say , the quantity @xmath47 to the quantity @xmath46 .",
    "the first functional equation is based on the observation that the unknown function @xmath51 should be invariant for a change in the unit of the quantity , that is , @xmath52 where @xmath27 is some scaling factor .    for , example , if our quantities concern sums of money , then a perceived loss should be invariant for a change in the monetary unit .",
    "the perceived loss of going from ten dollars to one dollar should be the same perceived loss if we reformulate this scenario in dollar cents , that is , if we go from a thousand dollar cents to a hundred dollar cents .",
    "note that we also may interpret in the following way .",
    "if person @xmath53 has an initial wealth of @xmath47 and person @xmath54 has a wealth of @xmath55 , where @xmath27 is some positive constant , then the perceived loss of person @xmath53 when going from @xmath47 to @xmath46 should be the same as the perceived loss of person @xmath54 when going from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "this alternative interpretation of connects with bernoulli s original derivation of the utility function , in that it is a corollary of the reasoning that led him to his third and final consideration . ] .    in order to give the second functional equation",
    ", we must introduce the function @xmath57 that enforces a change of context , @xcite : @xmath58.\\ ] ] the functional equation is a consistency equation that states that the perceived decrease in going from @xmath48 to @xmath46 , should be the same perceived decrease if we first go from @xmath48 to @xmath47 , and then from @xmath47 to @xmath46 .    if we assume differentiability , then the invariance equations and , together with the two boundary conditions : @xmath59 and @xmath60 are sufficient to find the function @xmath51 that quantifies the perceived decrease associated with going from the quantity @xmath47 to the quantity @xmath46 .",
    "we first will look at the structure that the invariance equation provides us in determining the form of @xmath51 . to do so , we take for the derivative over @xmath27 : @xmath61 which leaves with the partial differential equation @xmath62 or , equivalently , if we let @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 this partial differential equation has as its general solution : @xmath66 were @xmath67 is some arbitrary function .",

    "if we substitute into , we get : @xmath71 = \\theta\\!\\left[h\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right)\\right ] + \\theta\\!\\left[h\\!\\left(\\frac{y}{z}\\right)\\right].\\ ] ] letting @xmath72 $ ] , we may rewrite as : @xmath73 taking the derivative over @xmath47 , that is , @xmath74,\\ ] ] we obtain the ordinary differential equation : @xmath75 or , equivalently , @xmath76 if we let @xmath77 and @xmath78 , then we may rewrite as @xmath79 if we take the derivative of @xmath27 over , that is , @xmath80 then we obtain the ordinary differential equation : @xmath81 if we let @xmath82 , then we may rewrite as @xmath83 the general solution of @xmath84 is given as : @xmath85 where @xmath41 and @xmath86 are arbitrary constants",
    ".    it then follows from and that the function @xmath51 , which adheres to the invariance desideratum and the consistency desideratum , has as its general solution : @xmath87 where @xmath41 and @xmath86 are arbitrary constants .    from the boundary conditions and , it then follows , respectively , that @xmath88 and that @xmath89 , which leaves us with the specific solution : @xmath90 which is the bernoulli utility function , originally proposed by bernoulli in 1738 , @xcite .",
    "it follows that the bernoulli utility function is the only function that adheres to the desiderata of unit invariance and consistency , respectively , and , and the boundary conditions that a zero change should lead to a zero perceived loss and that a perceived loss should be assigned a negative value , respectively , and",
    ". any other utility function will be in violation with these fundamental desiderata and boundary conditions .",
    "the amazing thing here , at least to these authors mind , is that so much was gained for so little . as one need not mention monetary gains and losses or changes in offered sensory stimuli in order to derive the bernoulli utility function , or , equivalently , the weber - fechner law .",
    "we offer here the following observation , the functional equation is , in its alternative interpretation , an invariance argument for two persons holding different amounts of initial wealth .",
    "bernoulli , instead , uses variance arguments to arrive at his derivation . but both the variance and invariance arguments , as in the variance argument the wealth of person @xmath53 approaches the wealth of person @xmath54 . ] .",
    "in this section we will discuss the maximization of the sum of the lower and upper bounds , the third step in the bayesian decision algorithm , as a criterion of choice .",
    "this criterion is highly non - intuitive , as it admits no interpretation .",
    "this is because it is a ` corollary ' , or , to be more precise , an algebraic reshuffling , of a criterion which is intuitive , but less succinct in its expression .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath91 be two decisions we have to choose from .",
    "let @xmath92 , for @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , for @xmath95 , be the monetary outcomes associated with , respectively , decisions @xmath10 and @xmath91 .    in the bayesian decision analysis",
    ", we first construct the two outcome distributions that correspond with these decisions : @xmath96 where , if @xmath97 , the outcomes @xmath92 and @xmath94 may or not may be equal for @xmath98 .",
    "we then proceed , by way of the bernoulli utility function , or , equivalently , the weber - fechner law , to map utilities to the monetary outcomes @xmath92 and @xmath94 in .",
    "this leaves us with the utility probability distributions : @xmath99    our most primitive intuition regarding the utility probability distributions is that the decision which corresponds with the utility probability distribution which lies more to the right will also be the decision that promises to be the most advantageous .",
    "so , when making a decision we compare the positions of the utility probability distribution on the utility axis .",
    "this utility axis goes from minus infinity to plus infinity .",
    "hence , the more - to - the - right criterion of choice .",
    "now , the confidence bounds of , say : @xmath100 ,",
    "\\qquad   \\left[l\\!b\\!\\left(\\left.u_{j}\\right|d_{2}\\right ) , u\\!b\\!\\left(\\left.u_{j}\\right|d_{2}\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] may provide us with a numerical handle on the concept of more - to - the - right .",
    "for example , if we have that both @xmath101 then we will have an unambiguous preference for decision @xmath10 over decision @xmath91 ; seeing that under both the still probable worst and best case we will be better if we opt for @xmath10 .    likewise , if we have that either @xmath102 or @xmath103 then , again , we will have an unambiguous preference for decision @xmath10 over decision @xmath91 . in the constellation ,",
    "we stand , all other things being equal , to be better of under the still probable best case scenario ; while in the constellation , we stand , all other things being equal , to be less worse of under the still probable worst case scenario .    however , things become more ambiguous when , say , under decision @xmath10 , we have to make a trade - off between either a gain in the upper bound and a loss in the lower bound @xmath104 or a gain in the lower bound and a loss in the upper bound @xmath105    we postulate here that a rational criterion of choice in the respective trade - off situations and , would be to pick that decision whose gain in either the lower or upper bound exceeds the loss in the corresponding upper or lower bound .",
    "so , if , say , under @xmath10 we stand to gain more in the still probable best case scenario than we stand to lose under the still probable worst case scenario , that is , : @xmath106 then we will choose @xmath10 over @xmath91 .",

    "note that the gains and losses in this discussion pertain to gains and losses on the utility dimension , not on the monetary outcome dimension . on the utility dimension",
    "the phenomenon of loss aversion , that is , the phenomenon that monetary losses may weigh heavier than equal monetary qains , has already been accounted for .",
    "stated differently , the utility scale is a linear loss - aversion corrected scale for the moral value of monies .",
    "now , if we look at the scenarios and , and the corresponding postulated rational , because intuitive , criteria of choice and , then we see that we will choose @xmath10 over @xmath91 whenever we have that @xmath108 moreover , this single criterion of choice is also consistent with the choosing of @xmath10 over @xmath91 in the scenarios , , and .    this , then , is the rationale behind the non - intuitive , because it admits no interpretation , criterion of choice that we should maximize the sum of the lower and upper bounds of the utility probability distributions , in order to come to the optimal decision whenever @xmath109 a possible lower bound maximizer might be the regulator who is not that interested in a bank s potential profit , but only has an eye for the potential catastrophic losses that , were they to materialize , could destabilize the entire financial system . or , alternatively , one may use an upper bound maximization , that is , choose @xmath10 whenever @xmath110 where the upper bound maximizer is the banker that tries to maximize his yearly bonus . ] .    note that",
    "if the decision inequality goes to an equality : @xmath111 then we have that we will be undecided when it comes to the decisions @xmath10 and @xmath91 .",
    "also note that for @xmath112-sigma bounds translates to @xmath113 which , if substituted in , gives the inequality @xmath114 which brings us right back to bernoulli s expected utility theory , as proposed in 1738 , @xcite , in which it is stated that the expectation value of the utility probability distribution should be maximized .    nonetheless , the criterion of choice , that the sum of the upper and lower bound should be maximized , as proposed here , will deviate from bernoulli s initial 1738 proposal when the @xmath112-sigma intervals overshoots either its minimal or maximal value of the utility probability distribution .",
    "let @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively , be the minimal and maximal values of a given utility probability distribution .",
    "then we may identify two additional symmetry breaking cases , relative to : @xmath117 these two last symmetry breaking cases , where the @xmath112-sigma intervals overshoot the minimal and maximal values of a given utility probability distribution are non - trivial , as they give rise to the specific @xmath35-shape of the fair probabilities in certainty bets .",
    "another instance where we will deviate from bernoulli s proposal is when we put an explicit premium on either caution or opportunity .",
    "if we take as the lower and upper bounds , whose sum is to be maximized : @xmath118 and @xmath119 then and sum to : @xmath120 if in we let @xmath121 , then we put a premium caution ; if we set @xmath122 , then we put a premium on opportunity ; and if we let @xmath123 , then we have an equal trade - off between caution and opportunity taking .",
    "in this section we will demonstrate how to construct a non - trivial outcome distribution , by way of the product and sum rules , and how to map outcomes to their corresponding utilities by way of the product and sum rules .",
    "ellsberg found that the willingness to bet on an uncertain event depends not only on the degree of uncertainty but also on its source , @xcite .",
    "he observed that people prefer to bet on an urn containing equal numbers of red and green balls , rather than on an urn that contains red and green balls in unknown proportions .",
    "ellsberg called this observed phenomenon source dependence .",
    "tversky and kahneman @xcite , state that source dependence constitutes one of the minimal challenges that must be met by any adequate descriptive theory of choice . as our theory of choice",

    "say , we have a large urn consisting of 1000 balls of which 500 are red and 500 green .",

    "the probability of drawing @xmath128 red balls in the first bet @xmath10 may be modeled by way of a binomial distribution : @xmath129 now as the net return , say , @xmath130 is in dollars , having as its value number of red balls minus entrance fee , we have @xmath131 where , as there are @xmath127 draws , @xmath132 .",
    "we then make a simple change of variable , using , @xmath133 and substitute into , so as to get the probability function of the net return @xmath134 the probability distribution of the net return for bet @xmath10 , that is , @xmath135 then can be plotted as , figure  [ fig : p1.3.1 ] : +        this probability distribution has a mean and a standard deviation of , respectively , @xmath136    for the second bet , we tell our subject that the urn holds @xmath124 balls which are either red or green .",

    "there will be @xmath137 draws and after each draw the ball is to be placed in the urn again .",
    "the entrance fee of the bet is 50 dollars .",
    "however , we are also told that the number of red balls is neither zero nor thousand .",
    "but then the resulting outcome probability distribution would become unwieldy , because of this added structure .",

    "based on the background information , we assign an uniform prior probability distribution to @xmath143 , the unknown number of red balls in the urn : @xmath144 where @xmath145 .",

    "in this fact sheet we have presented the case for the bayesian decision theory .",
    "it may be read in jaynes @xcite , that to the best of his knowledge , there are as of yet no formal principles at all for assigning numerical values to loss functions ; not even when the criterion is purely economic , because the utility of money remains ill - defined . in the absence of these formal principles , jaynes final verdict was that decision theory can not be fundamental . this situation may have changed .    the bernoulli utility function , initially derived by bernoulli , by way of common sense first principles .",
    "] , has now been derived by way of a consistency argument . ] .",
    "this might explain why it is that bernoulli s utility function has proven to be so ubiquitous and successful the field of sensory perception research ; simply because it is consistent .",
    "the first two algorithmic steps of the bayesian decision theory , respectively , the construction of outcome probability distributions by way of the bayesian probability theory and the construction of utility probability distributions by way of the bernoulli utility function , allow us no freedom . to construct our outcome and utility probability distributions otherwise , would be to invite inconsistency .",
    "our initial justification for the bernoulli utility function had come from the observation that this function , in the guise of the weber - fechner and the steven s power law , had been demonstrated by psycho - physics to be an appropriate model for the way we humans perceive the increments in sensory stimuli , in terms of sensation strength .",
    "so , if monetary outcomes are considered to be a sensory stimuli , in the most abstract sense of the word , then it would follow the bernoulli utility function would be the most appropriate model for the way we humans perceive the increments in monetary wealth .",
    "as in the course of our research we came to trust the bayesian decision algorithm to teach our intuition , in those instances where the intuitive ` resolution ' is lacking to make clear and crisp choices , the burden fell on us to provide a proof of the fundamentalness of the bayesian decision theory .    the history of bayesian probability theory has taught us that the usefulness of a theory , in terms of its practical and beautifully intuitive results , in the absence of a compelling axiomatic basis , provides no safeguard against attacks by those who choose to close their eyes to this usefulness .",
    "this is why we felt compelled to search for a consistency derivation of the bernoulli utility function .",
    "especially so , since we had taken painstaking care to search out those ` unyielding practical realities ' , that would put our foundations to the test .",
    "and it had been found that all these practical realities fell nicely in line with the proposed foundations of the bayesian decision theory , as may be witnessed in our treatment of the ellsberg paradox and the kahneman and tversky data on the certainty effect .",
    "but one may take , trivially , any of the proposed allais paradoxes and solve them with the here proposed decision algorithm . ]",
    "so , having presented a consistency proof for the bernoulli utility function , the question now is : is the bayesian decision theory , just like the bayesian probability and information theories , bayesian in the strictest sense in the word , or , equivalently , an inescapable consequence of the desideratum of consistency ?",
    "we will now try to answer this question .",
    "there is one degree of freedom remaining in the bayesian decision theory as a whole .",
    "this remaining degree of freedom is the criterion of choice which states that we should maximize the sum of the lower bound of the utility probability distribution . ] .",
    "in any problem of choice we will endeavor to choose that decision which has a corresponding utility probability distribution that is lying most the right on the utility axis ; that is , we will choose to maximize our utility probability distributions .",
    "in this there is little freedom .",
    "but we are free , in principle , to maximize the positions of our utility probability distributions any way we see fit . nonetheless , we believe that it is always a good policy to take into account all the pertinent information we have .    for example",
    ", if we only maximizes the expected value of the utility probability distribution , then we will , by definition , neglect the information that the standard deviation of the utility probability distribution has to bear on our problem of choice , by way of the symmetry breaking in the case of an overshoot of one of the bounds .",
    "likewise , we are free to only maximize one of the bounds of our utility probability distributions , while neglecting the other . but",
    "in doing so , we will neglect the possibility of either ( catastrophic ) losses in the lower bound or ( astronomical ) gains in the upper bound .    in the bayesian probability theory we have an analogous situation of both constraint and freedom .",
    "the bayesian probability theory states that the product and sum rules of probability theory are the only two consistent and , therefore , admissible operators to combine probabilities with .",
    "but it also states that in our assignment of our probabilities we are totally free to do as we see fit .",
    "there are no ` wrong ' probability distributions , only better or worse informed ones .",
    "it s all a matter of choice .",

    "the whole of bayesian probability theory flows forth from two simple rules .",
    "the product rule , @xmath226 and the sum rule @xmath227    by way of the product and the sum rule , we may derive the generalized sum rule , @xmath228 if we have that the propositions are exhaustive and mutually exclusive , that is , @xmath229 , we may derive , by way of , , and the fact that @xmath230 , the most primitive probability distribution : @xmath231 this probability distribution then may be further generalized , by taken as it propositional elements the exhaustive and mutual exclusive conjunctions @xmath232 , to the bivariate probability distribution : @xmath233 which allows us to ` marginalize ' over the parameter , say , @xmath234 , which is of no direct interest : @xmath235 where @xmath236    we may let @xmath237 and @xmath238 , that is , the number of propositions @xmath239 and @xmath234 in , tend to infinity . by doing so",
    ", we go from discrete to continuous probability distributions .",
    "furthermore , we may add propositions @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , etc ... , and so get higher variate distributions .",
    "now , to a non - bayesian it may seem to be somewhat surprising , that the whole of bayesian probability theory flows forth from the product and rules .",
    "but the whole of boolean logic , on an operational level , is also captured by the and- and not - operations .",
    "these operations correspond , respectively , with and ; as these operators combine , with the negation of a nand - operation , in the or - operation , which corresponds with .",
    "moreover , it may be shown that boolean logic is just a special limit case of the more general bayesian probability theory .",
    "the operators of boolean logic combine in a like manner as the operators in bayesian probability theory .",
    "but in boolean logic propositions can have only the truth values true or false .",
    "whereas in bayesian probability theory propositions can have plausibility values in the interval @xmath243 $ ] , where @xmath188 and @xmath244 , respectively , correspond with false and true .",
    "so boolean logic is the language of deduction , whereas bayesian probability theory is the language of both induction and deduction ; the former being a limit case of the latter , in which we have absolute knowledge about the propositions in play .",
    "now , on the conceptual level bayesian probability theory is very simple .",
    "however , on an implementation level , when doing an actual data - analysis , it may be quite challenging ; which , as an aside , makes it fun to do bayesian statistics . and",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite , for a first cursory overview on the considerations that come with a bayesian data - analysis .",
    "the utility of a given outcome is the perceived worth of that outcome .",
    "if we take the utilities that monetary outcomes hold for us to be an incentive for our decisions , then we may perceive money to be a stimulus .    for",
    "the rich man ten dollars is an insignificant amount of money .",
    "so , the prospect of gaining or losing ten dollars will fail to move the rich man , that is , an increment of ten dollars for him has an utility which tends to zero .    for the poor man",
    "ten dollars is two days worth of groceries and , thus , a significant amount of money .",
    "so , the prospect of gaining or losing ten dollars will most likely move the poor man to action .",
    "it follows that an increment of ten dollars for him has an utility significantly greater than zero .",
    "we now will give the derivations of the bernoulli , the weber - fechner , and steven s power laws .",
    "it will be seen all that these three laws are equivalent .",
    "consider persons @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with @xmath53 having a fortune of 100.000 full - ducats , and with @xmath54 a fortune of 100.000 semi - ducats , a semi - ducat being the half of a full - ducat .",
    "let @xmath245 and @xmath246 be the moral value functions , defined on , respectively , the monetary full - ducat axis @xmath46 and the semi - ducat axis @xmath247 .",
    "let @xmath248 and @xmath249 stand for the initial wealths of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively ; where @xmath248 and @xmath249 are points on the monetary axes @xmath46 and @xmath247 , respectively .",
    "bernoulli derived his law by way of three simple variance considerations for the moral functions @xmath245 and @xmath246 , @xcite :    1 .",
    "for an arbitrary increment @xmath27 in wealth , the moral movement of this increment will be less for the rich man , than for the poor man ; that is , if we make for @xmath246 the appropriate change of variable , from @xmath247 to @xmath46 , then we have that @xmath250 from which it follows that effect of @xmath27 on a given @xmath51 decreases as the initial wealth increases .",
    "it is proposed that the movement in a general moral value function @xmath51 , for a given positive increment @xmath251 , is proportional to the value of this increment ; that is , @xmath252 as this is the simplest function for which @xmath51 increases as a function of an increment in @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , it is proposed that this movement in @xmath51 is inversely proportional to the value of the initial wealth @xmath46 ; that is , @xmath253    where ` @xmath254 ' is the proportionality sign .",
    "bernoulli arrived at his third consideration , using the following reasoning .",
    "the change in moral value of @xmath27 full - ducats for @xmath53 will be half the change in moral value of @xmath27 full - ducats for @xmath54 . only if either @xmath54 sees his fortune",
    "increased to 200.000 semi - ducats , or , equivalently , 100.000 full - ducats , or if @xmath53 sees his fortune reduced to 50.000 full - ducats , or , equivalently , 100.000 semi - ducats , only then will @xmath54 have the same change in moral value as @xmath53 for @xmath27 full - ducats . ] .",
    "so , if we make for @xmath246 the appropriate change of variable from @xmath247 to @xmath46 , @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the initial fortune of @xmath54 , translated from the semi - ducat @xmath247-axis to the full - ducat @xmath46-axis .",
    "it follows from that we have , in general , that the change in moral value is inversely proportional to the initial we hold , that is , @xmath257 which is bernoulli s third consideration .    if we combine the second and the third consideration , we obtain the differential equation @xmath258 which , if solved for the boundary condition that for a given person with an initial wealth of @xmath259 an increment of zero holds no utility , either negative or positive , gives @xmath260 which may be rewritten as @xmath261      let @xmath35 signify stimuli intensity and let @xmath262 signify sensation strength .",
    "weber s law states that the increment @xmath34 needed to elicit a judgment that @xmath263 is just noticeably different from @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath35 : @xmath264 where @xmath265 is a positive constant dependent upon the specific type of sensory stimulus offered and @xmath34 is understood to be the stimulus increment corresponding with a just noticeable difference .",
    "fechner generalized the experimental weber law by stating that all differences in sensational strength , and not only the ones that are just noticeable , are proportional to the relative change @xmath266 , that is , @xmath267 where @xmath112 is a positive constant dependent upon the specific type of sensory stimulus offered and @xmath34 is now understood to be the stimulus increment corresponding with the increment in sensation strength @xmath268 .    dividing both sides of by @xmath34 gives @xmath269 fechner then makes the assumption that , just as a physically small quantity @xmath34 can be reduced without limit to the differential @xmath270 , so a small quantity of sensation can be reduced without limit to the differential @xmath271 . by way of this assumption , we may let tend to the differential equation @xmath272 the general solution of this differential equation is @xmath273 where @xmath27 is some constant of integration .    introducing an initial value condition for that says that at stimulus value @xmath274 there is no sensation strength , that is , @xmath275 , leaves us with the weber - fechner law @xmath276 or , equivalently , @xmath277    the weber - fechner law , , is identical to the utility function which had been proposed a century earlier by bernoulli , .",
    "fechner himself was aware of this equivalence .",
    "nonetheless , he believed his derivation to be the more general .",
    "fechner argued that bernoulli s derivation only applied to the special case of utility , whereas his law , though identical , applied to all sensations , as it invokes weber s law .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , fechner failed to provide any compelling reason why the principles employed in bernoulli s derivation of the subjective value of objective monies should not be extendible to sensations in general .",
    "nonetheless , we do believe that fechner acted in good faith , in denying bernoulli scientific primacy .",
    "first of all , fechner called the weber - fechner law , when he first published it , very modestly , the weber law .",
    "second of all , fechner had a deep spiritual need for some kind of harmony between the physical and mental universes , and the weber - fechner law provided him with this harmony , for this law spoke of the basic oneness of the physical and mental universes , @xcite .",
    "the weber - fechner law demonstrated that both universes adhered to seemingly mechanistic laws .",
    "it then followed that the freedom of the latter universe , in terms of free will and volition , implied , by way of analogy , a commensurate freedom of the former ; thus , opening the way for the possibility of a besouled physical universe .",
    "which had become fechner s only hope for spiritual salvation , @xcite .",
    "we can imagine that fechner might have felt that a law that assigned subjective values to objective monies was too arbitrary and sordid a foundation for the lofty purpose he wished it to serve .",
    "in contrast , the initial weber law allowed fechner to forgo of the money argument and derive a law , which though in form identical to bernoulli s , differed in that it applied to all human sensations .",
    "steven s power law is based on the observation , that it is the ratio @xmath278 , rather than the difference @xmath268 , that is proportional to @xmath266 , @xcite .",
    "this observation leads to the equality @xmath279 letting the differences in @xmath262 and @xmath35 go to differentials , we may rewrite as @xmath280 this equation has its general solution @xmath281 taking the exponent of both sides of , we get the power law for stimulus perception @xmath282 where @xmath283 .",
    "stevens found the power law to hold for several sensations ; binaural and monaural loudness , brightness , lightness , smell , taste , temperature , vibration duration , repetition rate , finger span , pressure on palm , heaviness , force of hand grip , autophonic response , and electric shock , @xcite .",
    "the power law is applied by letting subjects compare the sensation ratio of @xmath284 to @xmath285 for corresponding stimuli strengths @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath274 : @xmath286 let @xmath287 , where @xmath34 is some increment , then we may rewrite as @xmath288 for an increment of @xmath289 , the ratio of perception stimuli will be @xmath290 .",
    "taking the log of the ratio we may map the ratio of perceived stimuli to a corresponding utility scale where a zero increment @xmath34 corresponds with a zero utility : @xmath291 but this is just the weber - fechner law , .",
    "the weber - fechner law gives us just noticeable differences on a log scale , .",
    "the power law gives us ratios of sensation strengths , .",
    "taking the log of the ratio of sensation strengths , we may obtain the just noticeable differences again , .",
    "but the weber - fechner for just noticeable differences is just the bernoulli utility function for utilities , .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , for a discussion of thurnstone s derivation of the satisfaction law .",
    "this law , which takes as its input the increment in the number of items of commodity , is also of the form of bernoulli s utility function .",
    "in this appendix we present the negative bernoulli utility function for debts , which is a corollary of the bernoulli utility function for income .",
    "the negative bernoulli utility function predicts that for the very poor , having a small initial wealth and large initial debts , a large loss of direct income will be more devastating , than an increase of , say , twice that loss in their long - term debt .",
    "this law also explains why , for these poor , having a small initial wealth and large initial debts , the temptation to take out loans , if offered the opportunity , will be quite great , @xcite .",
    "until now we have treated only the case were the maximal loss did not exceed the initial wealth @xmath84 .",
    "however , in real life we may lose more than we actually have , by way of debt .",
    "so , we now proceed to assign utilities to increments in debt .    according to the weber - fechner law",
    "we can not lose more money than we initially had .",
    "otherwise we may have that the ratio in the logarithm in the weber - fechner law , , @xmath292 may become negative , leading to a breakdown of the logarithm .",
    "however , whenever we incur a debt we lose more money than we have .",
    "furthermore , we can have a debt and an income , both at same time .",
    "so , we propose that there are two different monetary stimuli dimensions in play ; the first dimension being an actual income dimension and the second dimension being a debt dimension .    we propose to model the debt utilities by way of the negative weber - fechner law : @xmath293 where we let @xmath294 be the initial debt , @xmath295 the increment in debt , and @xmath116 the the weber constant of a monetary debt .",
    "the rationale behind is as follows .",
    "if we view a debt increment as a stimulus , then it follows that we may use the psycho - physical weber - fechner law in the determination of the moral value of a given debt increment .    for positive increments @xmath295",
    ", there is an increase in current debt , whereas for negative increments @xmath295 , there is a decrease in current debt . in order to assign both a negative utility to an increase in current debt and positive utility to a decrease in debt",
    ", we need to multiply the weber - fechner law times minus one , .",
    "if we have no initial debt , that is , @xmath296 , then tells us that any positive increment in debt @xmath295 would have a utility of minus infinity .",
    "this is clearly not realistic .",
    "so , in order to model an increment in debt for those who are without debt , we must introduce a minimum significant amount of debt which is equal to minimum significant amount of income , @xmath38 .    the threshold amount of debt , @xmath38 ,",
    "may also be used in the case of @xmath297 , in order to prevent an infinite utility being assigned to a full repaying of one s debts . using the concept of the minimum significant amount of debt stimulus",
    ", we may modify as @xmath298    if we want to give a graphical representation of , then the weber constant @xmath116 , must be set to some numerical value .",
    "say , we have a total debt of forty thousand dollars , in the form of a student loan , which we eventually will have to pay back , but not right now .",
    "then introspection would suggest that a increment or decrement of an amount less than a thousand dollars would not move us that much .",
    "so , @xmath299 constitutes one utile , or , equivalently , a just noticeable difference in debt for an initial debt of @xmath300 , that is , : @xmath301 if we then solve for the unknown weber constant @xmath116 of debt stimuli , @xmath302 we find this weber constant to be smaller by a factor of @xmath303 than the weber constant @xmath41 of income stimuli , .",
    "it is well possible that this difference in weber constants can be attributed to the difference in abstractness of the concepts .",
    "the losing of actual monies is quite concrete , whereas the accrueing of a debt , repayable somewhere in a distant future , is somewhat more abstract .",
    "but there is always a chance that these authors were off in their introspection of the debt stimuli has no direct bearing on any of the results given in this fact sheet ; save the handful of examples which are given in this section , in order to demonstrate the qualitative behavior of the negative bernoulli utility function , or , equivalently , the negative weber - fechner law . ] , and that both weber constants should be approximately equal .",
    "we leave this issue , together with the psychological reality of the phenomenon of debt relief , given below , for future psychological experimentation , as we proceed with our discussion of the debt utilities .",
    "suppose that a student has a student loan which has accumulated to forty thousand dollars .",
    "then , by way of and , we obtain the following mapping of increments in debt to utilities , figure  [ fig : p1.zq.1 ] .        as stated previously , loss aversion is the phenomenon that losses may loom larger than gains . in figure  [ fig : p1.zq.1 ]",
    "we see the phenomenon that debt reduction may loom larger than debt increase . we will call this corollary of the psycho - physical weber - fechner law : ` debt relief ' , the relief of loosing one s debts .    now , does the phenomenon of debt relief correspond with a real psychological phenomenon ?",
    "we belief that it actually does .",
    "say , we have a debt of a a thousand dollars .",
    "then we can imagine ourselves feeling greatly reliefed , were we to be released of our debt .",
    "now , were our debt , instead , to be doubled to two thousand dollars , then we can also imagine ourselves feeling unhappy about this .",
    "but this feeling of unhappiness about the doubling of our debt would be of a lesser intensity than the corresponding relief of having our debt acquitted .",
    "we will now look at the practical implications of the negative bernoulli utility function , , and its weber constant @xmath116 , .",
    "a student loan initially represents a gain in debt stimulus .",
    "this debt makes itself felt , in terms of actual loss of income , only after graduation , the moment the monthly payments have to be paid and take a considerable chunk out of one s actual income .",
    "say , that the student of figure  [ fig : p1.zq.1 ] , having become a phd , and having a net income of fifteen hundred dollars , is called upon to make good on his loan , by way of monthly payments of five hundred dollars .",
    "then these payments represent both a loss in income , having a negative utility of , and : @xmath304 as well as a decrements in debt , having a positive utility of , and : @xmath305 it follows that our phd can find little to no comfort in the fact that he is paying of his debt , as he acutely feels the sting of loss of income .",
    "this is , together with the difference in weber constants in the observed differences of the utilities and . ] , and , reflective of the fact that his utility function for income is highly non - linear in the neighborhood of the increment , whereas his utility function for debt is highly linear in that region .",
    "now , say that we have another phd , who during his student days lived a more frugal life style and , consequently , only has a debt of two thousand dollars . for this phd student ,",
    "when called upon to make good on the loan , the loss of income will be felt just as keenly , with a negative utility of @xmath306 , .",
    "however , he will find more satisfaction in the fact that he is paying of his debts , and : @xmath307 seeing that he has a more curved utility function for debt than our previous phd student .",
    "nonetheless , the first phd student may feel , after a couple of years of monthly repayments , when his loan has been reduced to twenty thousand dollars , for the first time , as if he has an actual stake in the repayment of his debt , and : @xmath308 as his debt repayment utility crosses the threshold of the just noticeable difference .",
    "the negative bernoulli utility function also gives an explanation why for the very poor , having a minimum monthly wage of seven hundred euros , and already having a large debt of , say , twenty thousand euros , a loss of income of , say , five hundred euros , is perceived to be so much more devastating than an increase in debt of , say , a thousand euros . as for this poor person , the loss of actual income has a negative utility of @xmath309 utiles and the gain of an increase of has a negative utility of only @xmath310 utiles , , this negative utility will only be @xmath311 utiles . ] .",
    "likewise , the temptation for the very poor , if offered the opportunity , to take out a loan of a thousand euros will be quite great .",
    "as for this poor person , the immediate gain of a direct increase of a thousand euros in income will have a positive utility of @xmath312 utiles , whereas the negative utility of an increase in debt of a thousand dollars will have a negative utility of only @xmath310 utiles , @xcite .",
    "bayesian statistics is not only said to be common sense quantified , but also common sense amplified , having a much higher ` probability resolution ' than our human brains can ever hope to achieve @xcite .",
    "this statement is in accordance with the kahneman and tversky finding that , if presented with some chance of a success , @xmath177 , subjects fail to draw the appropriate binomial probability distribution of the number of successes , @xmath128 , in @xmath313 draws . even though subjects manage to find the expected number of successes , they fail to accurately determine the probability spread of the @xmath128 successes .",
    "kahneman and tversky see this as evidence that humans are fundamentally non - bayesian in the way they do their inference , @xcite .",
    "we instead propose that human common sense is not hard - wired for problems involving sampling distributions .",
    "otherwise there would be no need for such a thing as data - analysis , as we only would have to take a quick look at our sufficient statistics after which we then would draw the probability distributions of interest .",
    "however , humans do seem to be hard - wired for more ` darwinian ' problems of inference .",
    "for example , if we are told that our burglary alarm has gone off , after which we are also told that a small earthquake has occurred in the vicinity of our house around the time that the alarm went off .",
    "then common sense would suggest that the additional information concerning the occurrence of a small earthquake will somehow modify our probability assessment of there actually being a burglar in the house .",
    "we may use bayesian probability theory to examine how the knowledge of a small earthquake having occurred translates to our state of knowledge regarding the plausibility of a burglary .",

    "the psychological paradigm of heuristics and biases originated as a reaction to the shortcomings of the mathematical expected utility theory .    in the 1950 s it was found that expected utility theory ,",
    "the then dominant decision theory , failed to adequately model human decision making in certain instances , leading to such paradoxes as the ellsberg and allais paradox .",
    "consequently , edwards and his research team of phd - students and post - docs took it upon themselves to remedy the situation , @xcite .",
    "kahneman and tversky , both post - docs under edwards , proposed to construct a systematic theory about the psychology of uncertainty and judgment . in this psychological theory a handful of heuristics",
    "would replace the mathematical laws of chance as a more realistic model for subjective judgment of uncertainty .",
    "but what started as a parsimonious theory of human inference , consisting of only three heuristics and their associated biases , @xcite , has proliferated into 20 heuristics and an impressive 170 + biases .",
    "heuristics are said to be mental short cuts or ` rules of thumb ' humans use to do inference .",
    "it is theorized that , as we do not always have the time or resources to compare all the information at hand , we use heuristics to do inference quickly and efficiently .    however , or so",
    "we are warned , even though these mental short cuts will be helpful most of the times , if used carelessly heuristics may lead to heuristic - induced biases , that is , systematic errors in reasoning , @xcite .",
    "for example , when we use the representativeness heuristic then we estimate the likelihood of an event by comparing it to an existing prototype that already exists in our minds , @xcite .",
    "our prototype is what we think is the most relevant or typical example of a particular event or object .",
    "the bias associated with the representativeness heuristic is that when making judgments based on representativeness we are likely to overestimate the likelihood that the representative event will occur ; just because an event or object is representative does not mean that it is more likely to occur .    in order to demonstrate",
    "this bias kahneman and tversky performed the following experiment , @xcite .",
    "they divided the participants in their study up into three groups .",

    "kahneman and tversky make in @xcite the implicit assumption that the reported use of representativeness , that is , an evaluation and use of the odds , as reported by the participants of the prediction group , necessarily implies their thesis .",

    "second , even if the description was valid when tom w. was in high school , it may not longer be valid now that he is in graduate school . finally , even if the description is still valid , there are probably more people who fit that description among students of humanities and education than among students of computer science , simply because there are so many more students in the former than in the latter field . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    as to the last consideration , it follows from the bayesian ` heuristic ' that the inference of tom being a computer science student implies the corollary inference that among all the graduate students who fit tom s description there will be more students of computer science than students of humanities and education . even if there are many more students in the field of humanities and education than in the field of computer science .",
    "the odds represent the ratio of humanities and education students to computer science students . whereas the odds represent the ratio of computer students having a profile like tom s to humanities and eduction students having a like profile .",
    "if the latter odds dominate the former , then we must conclude , by way of , that there are probably more people who fit tom s description among students of computer science than among students of humanities and education ; that is , @xmath366 . which invalidates kahneman s and tversky s last consideration .",
    "this , then , leaves us with the following arguments for the thesis that people tend to neglect the base rate , when taking the mental shortcut , thus , violating the rules of the normative [ that is , bayesian ] rules of prediction :    1 .",
    "given the notorious [ that is , clinical ] invalidity of projective personality tests , it is very likely that tom w. was never in fact as compulsive and as aloof as his description suggests .",
    "even if the description was valid when tom w. was in high school , it may not longer be valid now that he is in graduate school .",
    "now , it would seem that these arguments pertain to some other thesis , namely , that the participants of the prediction group should have disregarded the description of tom altogether , as no data was actually given .",
    "but this alternative thesis , apart from it not being the issue , is not all that compelling .",
    "because , if , in answer to the first argument , we filter out those qualifications which might point to compulsiveness and aloofness , then we are left with the following profile for tom :    * high intelligence , * dull and mechanical writing , * lacking in true creativity , * corny puns , * flashes of imagination of the sci - fi type , * strong drive for competence , * deep moral sense ,    which tells us quite a lot .",
    "it tells us that tom is very bright , does not like to read , as he apparently is not that lyrical in his writing , is not very artistic , has a sense of humor , has a passion for sci - fi , is disciplined , and has a sense of justice .    as to the second argument , which is also the hardest to answer .",
    "it is taught at the psychology courses , that personality traits tend to be stable over long periods of time .",
    "so , if tom did not like to write in high school , than chances are that he would pick a field op specialization in which he would not have to read and write a lot . which would make humanities and education less probable a field of choice , and computer sciences a more probable one .",
    "but , lest we forget , the original thesis under discussion was that normative rules of prediction tend to be neglected , as people tend to neglect the base rate ; not the alternative thesis that the prediction group should have disregarded the description of tom , because of the clinical invalidity of projective personality tests and the possibility that tom might have changed his personality over the course of the few years between high school and college .",
    "if kahneman and tversky wish to prove their initial thesis , then at this point , having presented their experimental data , they should proceed to demonstrate that their subjects could not possibly have used the normative , that is , bayesian , rules of prediction , as those rules would have implied results other than those that were observed . which they do not .",
    "having come to the end of our discussion of the representative heuristic , we find that the reported plausibility judgments by the prediction group are not inconsistent with a possible use of the bayesian  heuristic ; through , seeing that the odds may be assumed to lie in the realm of the possible .",
    "this leaves the kahneman and tversky experiment inconclusive .",
    "tversky and kahneman @xcite , state that non - linear preferences constitute one of the minimal challenges that must be met by any adequate descriptive theory of choice .",
    "we shall explain .",
    "if we have a bet which has the following outcome probability distributions @xmath367 and @xmath368 then people will typically prefer the bet @xmath10 over @xmath91 .",
    "in contrast , if we have a bet which has the following outcome probability distributions @xmath369 and @xmath370 then people will typically prefer the bet @xmath91 over @xmath10 .",
    "allais gave this example , in a slightly altered form , to demonstrate that savage s fifth axiom of independence does not hold , @xcite .    according to savage s independence axiom , which we most emphatically do not endorse ,",
    "we may add for both and a probability mass of @xmath371 to the proposition @xmath372 , while subtracting that same probability mass for the respective propositions @xmath373 and @xmath374 , leading to and , and still maintain the same problem of choice .",
    "but this assumption , as one would hope , is shown to be incorrect by the observed reversal in preferences from bet @xmath10 over @xmath91 to bet @xmath91 over @xmath10 .",
    "now , according to kahneman and tversky the example by allais not only refutes savage s axiom of independence , but it also shows that the difference between probabilities of 0.99 and 1.00 has more impact on preferences than the difference between 0.10 and 0.11 .    kahneman and tversky find this observation to be so full of meaning that they deem it to be a psychological phenomenon in and of itself , and proceed to label it as the ` certainty effect ' , @xcite , which later turns into ` non - linear preferences ' , @xcite .",
    "but for bayesians the phenomenon of non - linear preferences is both not that special and not that new of the beta distribution , @xmath375 is a consequence of the non - linearity of probabilities .",
    "if we make a change of variable from @xmath376 to the log - odds @xmath377 $ ] , then it may be found that the implied non - informative prior of the log - odds @xmath378 is uniform , @xmath379 so , log - odds , having the whole infinity of the @xmath46-axis at their disposal , are linear ; whereas probabilities , being forced to lie within the heavily constricted interval @xmath243 $ ] , are not . ] .",
    "while working on the german enigma code , during world war ii , good and turing introduced the ` deciban ' measure which is measured in decibans : @xmath380 and which gives the plausibility of a proposition being true , relative to it not being true , @xcite .    for undecidedness ,",
    "that is , for a fifty - fifty change of some hypothesis @xmath53 being true , we have @xmath381 substituting in , we find that undecidedness , , corresponds with @xmath382 just as 1 db sound represents the just noticeable difference relative to silence , so a @xmath383 deciban change in probability represents the just noticeable difference relative to undecidedness , @xcite .",
    "using , we find that the decibans associated with the probabilities 0.99 and 1.00 are , respectively , @xmath384 and @xmath385 now , tells us that a probability 1.00 is a limit case of absolute certainty . and tells us that a probability of 0.99 is not , representing just under 20 decibans of evidence for proposition @xmath53 being true .",
    "so , the difference in evidence for proposition @xmath53 being true for the probabilities 0.99 and 1.00 is much more than 1 deciban : @xmath386 in contrast , the probabilities of 0.10 and 0.11 correspond with a less than 1 deciban difference in evidence , : @xmath387",
    "so , if we find that subjects prefer the second bet in the second collection of bets , and , then this also may be interpreted as follows . subjects are indifferent to the difference in probabilities 0.10 and 0.11 , as this difference represents a change of less then 1 deciban in the plausibility of hypothesis @xmath53 being true , .",
    "so , all things being equal , subjects choose the bet with the highest potential payout of 5.000.000 dollars .    in closing ,",
    "the deciban , , represents the intuitive scale on which the plausibility of proposition @xmath53 being true , relative to it not being true , is judged ; that is , the deciban is the scale of the numerically coded plausibilities , whereas the probability , @xmath388 represents the non - intuitive ` technical ' scale , which follows from the quantification of our common sense , @xcite .",
    "so , if the difference between probabilities of 0.99 and 1.00 has more impact on preferences than the difference between 0.10 and 0.11 , as is found in psychological experiments , then this is reflective of the fact that the qualitative properties of the intuitive deciban - scale , up to a certain point , are retained in the transformation to the more technical probability - scale .",
    "we say up to a certain point , because probability theory , which makes use of the technical probabilities , is common sense amplified , having a much higher probability resolution than our human brains can ever hope to achieve . more concretely",
    ", we expect that for human probability perception the range of meaningful decibans is bounded somewhere around , say , @xmath389 deciban , @xcite .",
    "the assumption that preferences are not affected by variations of irrelevant features of options or outcomes is called invariance , @xcite . according to kahneman and",
    "tversky invariance is an essential aspect of rationality , which is violated in demonstrations of framing effects , @xcite .",
    "now , in order to discuss these framing effects , we will first have to discuss the topic of loss and gain adaptation .",
    "if this business man has not adapted to his loss , he is likely to add this loss to all the outcomes and , consequently , by way of the weber - fechner law , code the problem as a choice between the following utility distributions @xmath390 and @xmath391 where @xmath274 is the pre - loss asset position and @xmath41 is the weber constant for money .",
    "looking at the increments in assets , it is predicted that our business man will tend to prefer @xmath91 over @xmath10 , as this is the preferred choice under risk seeking in the negative domain .",
    "it follows that a failure to adapt to losses may induce risk seeking in the negative domain , @xcite",
    ".    stated differently , a person who has not made peace with his losses is likely to accept gambles that would be unacceptable to him otherwise .",
    "we may find support for this hypothesis by the observation that the tendency to bet on long shots will increase in the course of a betting day , @xcite .",
    "however , if our business man has adapted to his loss , then he will update his pre - loss asset position @xmath274 to an adjusted asset position @xmath392 in which the loss is discounted : @xmath393 and code the problem as a choice between the utility distributions @xmath394 and @xmath395 where @xmath392 is the post - loss asset position and @xmath41 is the weber constant for money .    again looking at the increments in assets",
    ", we see that the signs of these increments have reversed . by this reversal in the sign of the asset increments ,",
    "we go from a risk seeking in the negative domain scenario to a risk aversion in the positive domain scenario , @xcite .",
    "so , it is now predicted that our business man , having already adapted to his loss , will tend to reverse his preferences , and choose @xmath10 over @xmath91 .",
