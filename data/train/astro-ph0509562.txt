    "in the latter case , all charge states appeared to be present at similar distances from the central source , which implies local density gradients of 34 orders of magnitude . in this sense and to the end that our diagnostics of a 3000  ^-1 kms@xmath0  outflow is correct , pg1211 + 143  resembles a seyfert  1 galaxy , only the wind is slightly faster , perhaps a consequence of its higher luminosity .",
    "tumlinson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) study the uv spectrum of pg1211 + 143  and find two absorption systems blueshifted by @xmath181 and @xmath182 ^-1 kms@xmath0relative to the rest frame .",
    "they attribute them to igm in connection with two galaxy groups on the line of sight to pg1211 + 143 .",
    "although the absorption is identified also in the uv lines the column densities they measure are too low for an x - ray detection of these igm components .",
    "we examined the _",
    "far ultra violet explorer ( fuse ) _ observation of pg1211 + 143  from the _ fuse _ archive taken 14 months before the _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "we find no evidence for absorption in at the outflow velocities of @xmath183 ^-1 kms@xmath0  or @xmath184",
    "^-1 kms@xmath0 . with the ionic column density from our rgs model such lines should have been detected .",
    "the absence of the absorption in the _ fuse _ spectrum could be because of changes in the absorber between the two observations .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the strong k@xmath2 line at 21.79   required by our model is confused with the galactic k@xmath2 absorption line which is expected at 21.76   in the rest - frame wavelength scale of figure  [ pgtrgs ] .",
    "the emission lines in the _ fuse _ spectrum appear to have a narrower component with fwhm of about 2000 ^-1 kms@xmath0 , which correspond to the width of the balmer and the emission lines ( e.g. , baskin & laor 2005 ) but also a broader component consistent with the fwhm of 6000  ^-1 kms@xmath0we find for the x - ray emission lines .",
    "the observed fe - k absorption edge can be understood in the context of the ionized outflow .",
    "absorption spectra of fe ions feature edges due to ejection of k - shell electrons .",
    "for to these edges cover the range from 7.1 to 9 kev . in the more ionized cases , the spectral structure is not a simple edge as demonstrated most recently by kallman et  al .",
    "however , for ions close to neutral , an edge is an excellent approximation .",
    "the edge energy we find in the epic - pn spectrum ( figure  [ pnmodel ] ) falls at @xmath30  kev in the rest frame of pg1211 + 143 .",
    "this corresponds to charge states of to .",
    "if the fe edge is also due to the same 3000  ^-1 kms@xmath0  outflow observed with the rgs then it is associated with even less ionized gas .",
    "the k - edge position of the low charge states of fe all fall close to each other and certainly can not be resolved with the current ccd instruments .",
    "in addition , the broad ionization distribution in the outflow suggests that the observed edge is due to several charge states .",
    "indeed , the high optical depth at the edge ( 0.56 ) requires the contribution of several ( 510 ) fe ions , with a column density of about 10@xmath175  each .",
    "the more highly ionized fe ions ( table  [ coldens ] ) also must contribute to the photoelectric absorption at higher energies .",
    "we note that even deeper edges have been measured for similar sources ( e.g. , boller et  al .",
    "1 .   we have provided a self consistent model to the ionized outflow of pg1211 + 143  revealing an outflow velocity of approximately 3000  ^-1 kms@xmath0 .",
    "our model reproduces many absorption lines in the rgs band , although the s / n of the present data set is rather poor and some of the noise might be confused with absorption lines . 2 .",
    "the present approach is distinct from the commonly used global fitting methods and also from the line - by - line approach used by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "it allows for a physically consistent fit to the spectrum and is particularly appropriate for a broad - ionization - distribution absorber as observed here for pg1211 + 143 .",
    "the present model also features several broad ( fwhm = 6000  ^-1 kms@xmath0 ) emission lines , which are observed directly in the data .",
    "a broad and relatively flat ionization distribution is found throughout the x - ray outflow consistent with a hydrogen column density of roughly @xmath179@xmath185 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the outflow parameters measured in other well studied seyfert galaxies .",
    "we also detect fe - k absorption , which was identified by pounds et  al .",
    "( 2003a ) as a strongly blueshifted absorption line .",
    "we find that most of the fe - k opacity can alternatively be attributed to several consecutive , low charge states of fe , although it can not be assessed whether the absorber is co - moving with the outflow or not .",
    "future missions with microcalorimeter spectrometers on board might be able to address this interesting question .",
